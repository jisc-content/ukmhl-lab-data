Nor must we omit the shepherd’s faithful companion, friend, and helper—the dog—for without him no rural landscape would be complete. We all know Landseer’s touching picture ‘The Shepherd’s Chief Mourner,’ and, indeed, among the Highlands and the mountains of Wales, the dog is indispensable, for sheep have a peculiar faculty for going astray, and, like men, will follow their leader blindly into any boggle, so that whole flocks would frequently perish did not the sagacious dog come to the rescue.

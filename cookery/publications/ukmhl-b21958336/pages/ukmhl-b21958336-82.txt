78 OUR VIANDS said to have looked longingly at it, when he exclaimed, “ Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.’” It would appear from ‘ The Book of Days ’ that in olden times the boar’s head garnished with bay and rosemary, and heralded by trumpets, was borne to the king’s table on a dish of gold or silver by the server, followed by a long pro- cession of nobles, knights, and ladies. The same book gives the origin of the custom of serving this ancient dish at Queen’s College, Oxford, to a variation of the old carol. This arose from the presence of mind of a student of the college, who, when studying Aristotle in Shotover Forest, encountered a wild boar, which rushed at him open- mouthed, whereupon the scholar thrust the book down the creatures throat, thus ‘choking the savage with the sage.’ The carol used in serving the boar’s head ran ‘ ‘ ‘ Caput apri defero Reddens laudes Domino.” The boar s head in hand bring I With garlands gay and rosemary ; I pray you all sing merrily Qui estis in convivio. ‘ The boar’s head, I understand, Is the chief service in this land; Look wherever it be found, Servile cum cantico. 1 Be glad, both more and less, For this hath ordained our steward, To cheer you all this Christmas— The boar’s head and mustard ! “ Caput apri defero Reddens laudes Domino. ’ ’ ’

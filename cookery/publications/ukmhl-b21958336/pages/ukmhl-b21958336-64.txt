OUR VIANDS 6o in France the proverb exists for a peculiarly lucky fellow— II a trouve la /eve an gaieau. Twelfth-Day cakes and Twelfth-Day observances have, however, faded almost into oblivion in these utilitarian days, when even children begin to say, «What is the use of this and that ? ’ but in Ireland many of the old customs are still kept up, and a thimble, a crooked sixpence, and a wedding ring are baked in cakes, the first for the old maid, the second for wealth, and the ring, of course, for a wedding; but, if memory serves aright, these fortune-telling cakes are eaten on Halloween instead of Twelfth Day, and I do not know whether the Twelfth-Day ‘ King of the Bean’ is still elected. We read that in 1613 the gentlemen in Gray’s Inn were permitted by Lord Bacon to perform a Twelfth-Day masque at Whitehall, in which a character called Baby Cake was attended by an usher bearing a great cake with a bean and a pease. * The ‘ King of the Bean ’ is supposed to have been derived from the Roman Saturnalia, in which lots were drawn with beans as to who should be king. There is, however, one cake that seems to grow in favour year by year, and that is the bridecake, upon which all the confectioner’s art is lavished, until it seems almost a sin to cut it and destroy its beauty. In fact, some of the more elaborate specimens are so made that the cake may be abstracted without injuring the external case. The monster cake presented to the Queen on her Jubilee was thus made, so that the exterior was on view intact among the other presents, although the kernel was gone. Lawn-tennis has created a new cake, which is highly * Chambers’s ‘ Book of Days,’ vol. i., p. 63.

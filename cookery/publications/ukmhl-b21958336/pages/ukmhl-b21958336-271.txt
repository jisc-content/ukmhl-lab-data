Bake it gently ; when it is baked, take off the top and put in your caudle, made of gravy from the bones, some white wine and juice of lemon; thicken it with the yolks of 2 eggs and a bit of butter.

Note.—If you observe too much fat swimming on the liquor of your pie, take it off before you pour in your caudle.

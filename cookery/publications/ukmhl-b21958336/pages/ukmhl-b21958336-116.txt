I 12 OUR VIANDS before I know not, but it is attributed to a certain “ powerful chieftain of antiquity ” who lived in the before-named ancient State of King-ts-oo to have been the first person who laid in stores of “ painted eggs,” and set the fashion of dispensing them as gifts to friends and acquaintances at that same time of year when we celebrate Easter.’ The Chinese spring festival always occurs in April when the sun enters the fifteenth degree of Aries, and as the cock is sacred to the sun, the egg may have come in this way to symbolise the new spring birth of nature through the vivifying influence of the sun. At all events the gift of brightly coloured eggs at the early spring festival can be traced not only in China but also in Persia, where we find them in connection with a festival, the origin of which is ascribed to the Persian mythical monarch Jemsheed, sixth in descent from Moses, who is said to have reigned 700 years. The writer above quoted says ‘ The greatest of Jemsheed’s festivals was the Nowroose, or Feast of the beginning of the Religious or Solar Year. It commenced at the time of the “ natural reproduction of all that conduces to the sustenance of man.” With a slight variation from the Chinese calcula- tion, the Persian Festival is held to begin the moment the sun enters Aries, or towards the end of March. The Nowroose Festival is, of course, much older than Maho- metanism. Some writers call it the “ Feast of the Waters,” and consider it a memorial of the Deluge; while others suppose it to have been instituted to commemorate the Creation. A prominent feature that all travellers record as taking place at the time is the handing about of eggs dyed of various colours and gilt, given as gifts to each other, and even to strangers, in honour of the great Spring fast.

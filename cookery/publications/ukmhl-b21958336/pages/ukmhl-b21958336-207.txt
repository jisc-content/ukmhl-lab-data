203 STONE FRUITS AND BERRIES The elderberry, once so highly esteemed as a wine producer, is now neglected. Fifty years ago a glass of hot spiced elder wine, with sippets of toast, formed a Christmas beverage handed nightly to honoured guests in country houses. Now, even our peasants must have port or sherry, and the flower and berry of the elder are left to ‘waste their sweetness on the desert air.’ Yet elder-flower wine was once thought equal to Frontignac, and there was a scramble between man and bird for the berries : the latter are now allowed to enjoy them unmolested, and they do not let them hang long upon the tree when ripe.

Once upon a time preserved barberries were used in tarts, and thought delicious; now, however, you very seldom see them in the market, and, if used at all, it is only by way of garnishing, for which they are eminently suitable.

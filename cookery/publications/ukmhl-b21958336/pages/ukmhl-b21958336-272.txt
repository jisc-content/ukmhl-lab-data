268 OUR VIANDS Eel Pie (old recipe).—Cut, wash, and season them with sweet seasoning and a handful of currants; butter and close it. Some omit the currants. Meats, Etc.—Old Recipes. For Roasting Beef.—If a sirloin or rump, you must not salt it, but lay it a good way from the fire; baste it once or twice with water and salt, then with butter; flour it, and keep basting it with its own dripping. When the smoak of it draws to the fire it is near enough done. If the ribs, sprinkle them with a little salt half an hour before you lay it down ; dry and flour it, then butter a piece of paper very thick, and fasten it on to the beef; put the buttered side next the meat. For Roasting Lamb or Mutton.—The loin and the saddle must be done as the beef, but the skin should be raised and skewered on again to prevent it from scorching. A quarter of an hour before you take it up, take off the skin, dust on some flour, baste with butter, and sprinkle on a little salt. Garnish with scraped horse radish, and serve with potatoes, brocoli, French beans, watercresses, pickled cabbage, etc. The shoulder requires onion sauce. To Roast Mutton, Venison Fashion.—Take a hind quarter of fat mutton, and cut it like a haunch; lay it in a pan with the back side down; pour a bottle of red wine over it, and let it lie twenty-four hours; then spit it and baste it with the same liquor, and butter all the time it is roasting at a good quick fire; two hours and a half will do it. Have a little good gravy in a boat, and currant jelly in another. A good fat neck of mutton eats finely done thus.

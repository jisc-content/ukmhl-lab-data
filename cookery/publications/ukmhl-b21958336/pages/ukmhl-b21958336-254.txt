250 OUR VIANDS purslane, recombole, finscha, corn salad, etc., etc., a great many of which will read as Greek to modern ears, although we have some others in their places which, if not new, are more abundant than in the days of our great-grandmothers. To the old recipes I have added others of more modern date, supplied by friends who have tried and found them good. Some of these come from the Cape of Good Hope and from Scotland, and a few are culled from the very excellent ‘Domestic Cookery,’ by a lady, published in 1810, and also two or three Portuguese dishes from Mrs. Addison’s ‘Economical Cookery Book,’ which is not so well known as it deserves to be. Bread, Cakes, Pastry. Whole-meal Bread.—To 5 lbs. of meal take 1 oz. carbonate of soda, f oz. tartaric acid, 3 pints wrater. Dissolve the soda in 2\ pints of water, and mix thoroughly with the meal in a glazed pan ; let it stand an hour or so; then dissolve the tartaric acid in the remaining ^ pint of water, and mix as quickly as possible; put on and under tins, and into the oven immediately—oven rather sharp heat. We have been favoured with the above recipe by a London baker. U7ifermenicd Bread.—Take fine flour 5 lbs., bicarbonate of soda 1 oz., pure tartaric acid x oz., water 1 quart, salt \ oz. Mix the bicarbonate of soda and salt with the flour, and put the tartaric acid into the water, and then blend the whole in the usual way of making dough; bake in tins, or without. Bread thus made has an agreeable taste, keeps much longer than fermented bread, is more digestible, and less liable to turn sour or mouldy.

61 CAKES AND PUDDINGS appreciated. We believe this originated in Bath, famous for many confectioners’ chefs d'ceuvres, which can hardly be met with elsewhere, such as the Sally Lunn, which is quite a different thing there to the cake known under that name elsewhere, and the Bath bun, which can only be eaten in perfection in Bath. The lawn-tennis cake is a rich plum cake, made rather thin and flat, with a good covering of almond paste, iced, and with a sprinkling of sweetmeats or green angelica cut very fine on the top. In Cornwall many peculiar cakes may be met with, but almost all of them contain saffron, which does not commend them to all palates. Scotland is known as ‘ the land of cakes,’ and the variety to be met with there is astonishing. The best known is the shortbread, which is now sold largely in London— especially at Christmas—daintily put up in boxes and with a motto in candied peel on the top; but this short- bread varies greatly: that made in Aberdeen is the best, especially that sent to Balmoral, which is said to be made of crushed macaroons. There is a well-known cake which should rather be classed under the head of puddings; this is the pancake, still religiously eaten on Shrove Tuesday, which the old riddle has, in consequence, designated as the greatest fryday of the year. The custom of eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday dates back to very remote times, and the tossing them in the pan was the occasion of much merriment.

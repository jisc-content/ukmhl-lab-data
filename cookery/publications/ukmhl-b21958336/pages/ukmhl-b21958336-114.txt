i io OUR VIANDS found in tombs in Egypt, Greece, and Etruria; among the Etruscan relics are several ostrich eggs beautifully painted. These sepulchral eggs were, doubtless, symbolical of a future life, but were also probably designed as food for the dead, for it was well-nigh a universal practice to provide food for the departed spirit, a practice still in use among savages. The eggs which are given at Easter time are supposed to symbolise the Resurrection, but it is certain that the custom oiiginated in pre-Christian times. Eggs wrapped in various-coloured ribbons, and boiled—thus receiving the dye from the ribbon used—were formerly sent as Easter gifts. These are still sometimes seen in little shops, but the Easter eggs now sent as presents by those who can afford them do not owe their origin to any feathered fowl, but are artificially made of various substances, and filled with gifts of differing value, from chocolate creams to diamond rings or costly shawls. It is both curious and interesting to note that in almost all countries this custom of giving and receiving brightly coloured eggs at a spring festival, has prevailed from time immemorial; hence, probably, we see in the painted ostrich eggs from Etruscan tombs, which are at least two thousand years old, the spring gift of friends to the beloved dead. A writer in the Standard some years ago, in a very interesting article traced this custom to China; he says: — £ Gustave Schlegel, during his official residence in China as representative of the Netherlands, in his interesting and erudite researches through a mass of Chinese literature discovered that the “painted eggs,” as they are called in China, were used in the great Spring Festival of Tsing-ming, and are noticed

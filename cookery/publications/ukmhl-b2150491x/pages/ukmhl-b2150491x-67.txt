In France a sumptuous breakfast is seldom eaten, and it mostly consists of little more than a cup of coffee or chocolate, some- times with a roll and butter, generally taken in the bed-room. To make up for this a mid-day meal, called “ dejeuner a la fourchette,” is taken, and in- cludes meat and wine. In hot countries breakfast is taken at dawn, so that the morning’s work can be got over in time for the siesta, or noon-day sleep, during the heat of the day. The name breakfast is sometimes given to a meal after an important occa- sion ; hence we have wedding breakfasts and hunting breakfasts. These are much more elaborate repasts than the early-morning meal, and comprise all sorts of dishes, joints, entrees, game, pastry, sweets and wine. The subjoined menu, as carried out on the Earl of ’s table, describes the extent to which a meal called breakfast is now-a-day carried. There were between one hundred and fifty and two hundred dishes, consisting of crayfish in jelly, mayonaise of salmon, shrimp patties, lobsters, oyster patties, pheasants, galantine of veal, tongues, ham, caviar, boar’s head, pigeon pie, turkey, foie-gras, game pie, chickens, creams, jellies, French pastry, Charlotte Russe, ice puddings, apples and rice, tipsey cake, meringues, nougat, trifle, macedoine of fruit, lemon sponge, shaddock, peaches, pears, oranges, apples, Orleans plums, and a choice of superior wines and liqueurs. Breast of Lamb.—The breast is cut from a large lamb, a small one not affording sufficient meat to make this part worth cutting into a separate joint. It is generally stewed, and makes a most tender and delicious dish peculiarly suitable to per- sons whose appetites require tempting.

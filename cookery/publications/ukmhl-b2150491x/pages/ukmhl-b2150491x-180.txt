14G [kip KID] in olden times its flesh was esteemed as much as lamb is now. In those days flocks of goats were as common as flocks of sheep, and though we do not read of the flesh of the full-grown goat being used for food, they were kept, much as cows are now, for the sake of their milk. Rebecca deceived her husband Isaac by sending Jacob with “ savoury meat,” prepared from “ two kids of the goats,” which was represented as being venison Esau had taken by hunting. The flesh of the kid is very sweet and tender, though not so good as lamb. It is generally cooked whole like the sucking-pig, and, being a dry meat, is either larded before being roasted, soaked for a few hours in some kind of marinade, or roasted with strips of fat bacon bound round it.

They have a peculiar and slightly bitter flavour which is an appetising antithesis to dainty dishes. Hence, kidneys grilled and devilled have always been a favourite breakfast or luncheon dish with bon- vivants. Kidneys take a long time to digest, and are, therefore, very suitable for those who take their meals at long intervals. Kipper.— A term applied to salmon, mackerel, or herrings split open from the back, salted, smoked, and dried. It is derived from the Dutch verb kipper, signifying to hatch, to spawn, and was originally applied to salmon caught just after spawning, when, being unfit for eating fresh, they were in consequence salted and dried. The restrictions imposed by recent Fishery Acts forbid the taking of salmon during the close season. But

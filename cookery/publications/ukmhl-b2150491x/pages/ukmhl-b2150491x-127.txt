These cur- rants are much used in English cookery to make mincemeat, puddings, and cakes. lhe common plum-cake, so called, seldom contains any fruit be- sides currants. The extent to which they are used in this country may be judged from the fact that in 1872 we imported 569,400 tons. The small grapes from which they are made are originally red or blue, and these are simply dried on the ground in the sun. They form the principal article of export from Greece, where a very sweet, oily kind of wine is also made from them. Dripping.—The fat of meat which exudes while it is being roasted or baked. Dripping becomes hard when it is cold, and can be used in cookery for frying, making pastry, or, in some instances, as a substitute for butter.

Some of these are eatable, even delicate in flavour, while others have a gross and rank taste. The domestic duck originates from the mallard, or wild duck (which see); it is mostly larger, and with- out the gamey flavour disliked by some consumers.

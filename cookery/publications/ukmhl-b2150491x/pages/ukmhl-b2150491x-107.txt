73 [OOF cod] This fruit is of very ancient origin, and was pro- bably introduced into this country by the Romans. It can now be found all over England, where it has been grafted on a variety of trees, even on the common crab-tree, without losing its superior flavour. Codling .—The young of the codfish before it reaches the weight of ten pounds.—(See Codfish.) Cod’s Roe.—The roe of the cod, like that of other fish, is of two kinds, the hard and the soft; of the former, it has been estimated that a single fish will yield nine million ova. Cod’s roe is eaten fresh, and is considered a great delicacy when salted and smoke-dried, in which state large quanti- ties are imported from Newfoundland. Cod’s Sounds.—The codfish is supplied with air or swimming bladders, by means of which it can ascend or descend in the water. They are called sounds, and are cut out of the fish as soon as it is caught, then salted and packed in barrels. They will keep good any length of time ; and are con- sidered a delicacy boiled in milk or broiled. Coffee.—The infusion of the ground berry of the coffee plant has steadily increased in favour as a refreshing beverage ever since the time of its first introduction. Coffee was originally grown in Arabia, and Mocha coffee is still famed as the best. The plant is extensively grown in the West Indies, and attains a height of twelve to fifteen feet, with laurel- like leaves. The beans are enclosed in a red berry resembling a cherry. When dried in the sun the husk is separated from the seeds, which are then roasted and ground; their well-known aroma is not de- veloped until they have been roasted. The undried beans have a peculiar taste, and are used in the dis- tillation of a liqueur called “Coffee Liqueur.” There

261 [soli SORJ characteristics of the ocean bed where it is found. If its colour he white, we call it the white sole ; if muddy, the black sole; the latter being considered the finest quality, those being preferred which are rather small in size, and which have been caught in shallow waters on the coasts. Soles are usually caught by means of trawl-nets, and great skill is required, for, if the fishermen drag their nets too quickly, a large number of the fish will be violently thrown into a heap at the bottom ot the nets, and will thus become damaged, while it is desirable to bring them alive to the shore. Small crabs and shell-fish constitute their principal food. Sorrel—A plant belonging to the genus Oxalis, several species of which grow wild in England. The leaves are all more or less acidulous from the pre- sence of oxalic acid ; they are sometimes used in the place of rennet. Sorrel is employed a good deal in France and Germany for culinary purposes, its leaves making a pleasant salad. The roots resemble rhubarb, and possess properties useful for medicine and dyeing; they are considered anti-scorbutic, and when dried and boiled, yield a brilliant colour ; when powdered, used as an excel- lent dentifrice. Where it has once grown, sorrel is very difficult to eradicate, and after a year’s growth its roots can hardly be entirely destroyed; but unless this be done thoroughly, every portion will retain its power of putting forth fresh buds and shoots. Souffle.—This name is given to a very lignt substance of which eggs are the principal ingredient,, the whites being beaten to a froth with rice flour, arrowroot, or very fine wheat flour, mixed with milk or cream, sugar (if for sweets), and flavourings.

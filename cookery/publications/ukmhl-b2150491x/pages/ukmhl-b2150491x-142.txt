108 [fee cally-speaking, ice is water congealed by intense cold. In the process of freezing, as it usually occurs in nature, the act of solidification goes on, not continu- ously, hut in successive layers, that is to say, it freezes from the top downwards. Ice, and all very cold water, is lighter than water at an ordinary temperature, and in passing from the liquid to the solid state, water expands about one-fourteenth, by which the production of ice acquires an enormous mechanical force, thus accounting for the frequent bursting of our water-pipes during a severe frost. Major Williams, at Quebec, filled a twelve-inch shell with water and closed it by a wooden stopper driven in with a mallet; he then exposed the shell to a temperature of 13Â° Fahr., and on the water freezing, the stopper was projected a distance of more than one hundred feet, while a cylinder of ice about eight inches long was protruded from the hole. It is the expansion and consequent lightness of ice which enables it to float upon the surface of water. The demand for ice in hot countries having become very great during recent years, many methods of producing it artificially have been discovered, but the principal of these is to mix hydrochloric acid with crystallized sulphate of soda. Various machines have been made for producing ice arti- ficially, and the first successful invention of this kind was patented in 1850 by Twining, an American. The pictet machine, introduced in 1876, which acts by the evaporation of sulphurous acid, produces artificial ice at the cost of one cent per pound. Some American methods produce six tons of artificial ice from each machine per day. Enormous quantities of frozen meat are now brought over to this country from America, New Zealand,

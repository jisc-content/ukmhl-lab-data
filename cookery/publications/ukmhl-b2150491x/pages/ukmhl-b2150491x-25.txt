PREFACE. My attention having for some time been directed tp the classification of Food-products, simple and luxu- rious, their description and utilisation, it has been suggested that such a work as the present would he generally welcomed. Encouraged and assisted by scientific collaborators, and, in some instances, by celebrated chefs de cuisine, I have compiled this little volume, which, it is hoped, will be of some practical value and interest to ladies superintending then’ housekeeping, superior hotel-keepers, or their managers, and to all who concern themselves with the delicacies and necessaries that find their way to the table. In a word, this little book is intended to show the reader at a glance precisely what he wishes to know on the subject, and to give him in a succinct form an amount of information which would otherwise cost him much time and labour to obtain. More- over, the names of new delicacies and foods are here inserted, and the articles described; whilst the foreign terms which appear on menus are translated or explained. Every subject referring to the table is judiciously treated, and all technicalities made intelligible ; in fact, it may confidently be said to all who wish for information upon the subject of foods, condiments and beverages, “ Look within and you will find it.”

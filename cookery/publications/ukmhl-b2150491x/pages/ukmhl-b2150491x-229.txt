Sheep, hares and rabbits are excessively fond of parsley ; the two latter will travel long distances to obtain it, and the flesh of animals that have been fed upon it possesses a specially fine flavour. It has been considered an effectual cure for rot in sheep, if given in sufficiently large quantities, while on the contrary the seed is said to be a deadly poison to parrots. Hamburg parsley is cultivated for its roots, which grow as large as small parsnips. When boiled they form a very tender, palatable, and wholesome vegetable, either for eating with meat, or as an ingredient in broth or soup. Parsnip.â€”This useful vegetable belongs to the natural order Umbelliferce. In a wild state the flavour of its roots is harsh and unpalatable, but when carefully cultivated they form a highly nutritious and agreeable vegetable, being fleshy, sweet and mucilaginous. In times of scarcity, when wheat has been dear and difficult to procure, a very excellent bread has been made from the roots of parsnips, ground to powder. The parsnip is a very fattening vegetable, water, starch, fibre, sugar, and albumen being its component parts. It pays for care bestowed upon its cultivation, and is very hardy, both in its wild and cultivated state. Do- mestic animals will readily feed and fatten upon it. Parsnip wine, if made properly, is very exhilarating and refreshing, having somewhat the flavour of Madeira. There is a plant called Silver Weed, the flavour of which is similar to that of the parsnip ; it grows in many parts of Scotland, and is often eaten there. o

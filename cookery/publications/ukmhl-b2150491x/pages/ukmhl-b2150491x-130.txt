EEL*J 0 6 [ego annual feast of snails is also said to be held in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, but both stories are probably apocryphal. Eel-—This is a very nutritious fish, whose flesh has a particularly good flavour. It is eaten boiled, stewed, fried, and prepared in many other ways; in the Channel Islands a soup is made from the large variety known as the conger. There are several kinds of eel, both fresh watei? and salt, and some of the latter attain to a great size; the silver eel is considered the best. All eels have the appearance of serpents, having but few fins, and they generally live in the mud or sand. Their diet consists of small molluscs and refuste, and when in want of food the common eel will leave its native element and wander about the fields by night in search of snails, or other prey, and will often betake itself to isolated ponds for the sake of a change of residence. The eel is very productive, and its spawn is generally deposited at the mouths of rivers, or in harbours where the water is brackish. The milt and roe are situated in the same part as in other fish, but they present a rather unusual appearance. Eels were at one time supposed to be viviparous animals, in consequence of living creatures having been often found inside them, which were thought to be then young, but these are now proved to be parasites with which eels are frequently infested.

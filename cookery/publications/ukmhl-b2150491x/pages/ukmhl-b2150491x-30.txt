INTRODUCTION. X Even Roman manners ancl customs are to some extent reflected in those of society at the present day. After the legions of the Empire departed from our shores the effects of their sojourn amongst us were visible in the impetus given to the polite arts, and to culinary operations especially. The living of the people was greatly improved and the bills of fare became more comprehensive and diversified; vegetables, however, were still comparatively scarce and herbs were substituted. Cooks prided them- selves upon producing sweet and savoury dishes, which were not only pleasing to the palate but were also attractive to the eye, in the form of ships, castles, figures, animals and other shapes. A still more sumptuous mode of living gradually found its way into Britain; wine and beer were copiously consumed, and feasting became an important feature both in public and private life. Intercourse with other nations materially assisted caterers for the table in obtaining a greater variety of articles of food, revealing from time to time in their bill of fare the names of new dishes, to which were added various original inventions. In this respect France quickly acquired and retained the leading place ; nevertheless it must be confessed that some of their dishes have not yet been adopted with great gusto in this country : frogs, for instance, those harmless little creatures, are not yet appreciated by the English public, who again are not particularly partial to cocksâ€™ combs, rognons de coq, or snails; they are well satisfied with the adoption of a mayonnaise, a vol au vent, or a soufflee, but new dishes were introduced and became fashionable. Thus also with manners and customs, that which was once the fashion is not so now.

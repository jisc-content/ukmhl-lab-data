[pat 197 pat] cacy is made from the fat livers of geese. Alsace had long been celebrated for its fat goose livers, covered with clarified butter, enclosed in eaithen pipkins, and called “ terrines,” when, in the latter half of the last century, Marshal de Contades was appointed military governor there. He arrived at Strasburg with a Norman cook named Close, as one of his household, and he was the first who trans- formed the “terrines” into pies, by substituting pie crust for the earthen jars. The geese whose livers are destined to form pate de foie gras are fed three times a day on maize, a spoonful of poppy oil being added after the twenty-first day. Water, always containing a certain proportion of sweet wort from the breweries, is freely given to them. After forty- two days of this treatment the goose weighs about sixteen pounds. It is then considered fat enough to be killed, and the liver is generally found to weigh thirty-two ounces.

Six livers are generally included in each pie, of which one and a half are beaten in a mortar with bacon, shalots, mushrooms and parsley, and pressed through a sieve; this mixture is then boiled into a forcemeat. The other half livers are interlarded with Perigord truffles, cut in dice at the bottom of the pie, a layer of truffles comes next, and then a layer of forcemeat. Thus the pie is filled up, covered with crust and baked. After baking, the crust is raised, and a large glass of Madeira poured into it ; it is then hermetically closed and packed for export. Pate de foie gras is made at a few towns in the south of France as well as Strasburg, but Alsace still maintains its pre- minence. The stories of the cruel treatment of

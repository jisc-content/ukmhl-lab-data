tom] [ton 284 * —%. as held up to view in a glass. Very little finds its way into this , country, as it is almost wholly bought up by the Royal and noble families of the Continent. Tomato, also called the Love Apple.—It is a native of the tropical parts of South America, but may now be considered as. naturalized in more tem- perate regions, thriving well in the warm countries of Europe, and if raised in a hot-bed in the early part of the season, it will produce fruit when planted out in a warm border. Its culture, however, re- quires great care, and owing.to this, it is not grown to any great extent in England. It. is a favourite article of food in Italy, where whole fields are covered with it. When ripe the fruit attains the. size of an apple. It is compressed at its crown and base, and furrowed along the sides, the whole being uniform in colour, smooth and shining. The sh^pe and colour of the fruit differ somewhat in different varieties, but its prevailing tints are bright red and orange. At every stage of its growth the tomato is eatable; when green it is pickled, when ripe, used for sauces, soups and omelettes. It is one of the most wholesome fruits that can be eaten, and deserves to be far more generally known and appre- ciated. Tongue.—The tongue of most animals is re- garded as a delicacy. It is extremely tender and juicy, rather too much so, perhaps, for eating when fresh, and, therefore, tongues are generally cured. The ox tongue is the most largely consumed (See article under that name),but reindeer’s, pigs’ and even sheep’s tongues are also eaten. Reindeer’s tongues are dried, and require soaking before being cooked; they are not so large as that of the ox, but are considered by some persons of a more gamey flavour.

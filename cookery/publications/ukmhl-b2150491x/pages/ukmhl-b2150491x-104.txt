They are generally found on the sea shore, but sometimes in rivers, and a variety of the cockle is often to be seen in the Thames near Greenwich, when the tide is high and the water is, therefore, of a salt flavour. The largest are found around the Scilly Islands, the north coast of Devonshire, the Hebrides and Zetland. They are gathered in great numbers for purposes of food, and are always found about low water mark, half buried in the sand. They are very lively, and will live some time after leaving the sea if placed in a basin of water. They should be washed in several waters, and well scrubbed with a brush, and then again put into salt water. They may be dressed in a variety of ways, but perhaps the best is to boil them in their own liquor. Cockles afford considerable sustenance, and it is recorded that during a failure of the potato crop in the Orkney Islands, about sixty years ago, many of the poorer people in Sanda lived for some considerable time almost entirely upon them. Cockles have played a distinguished part in history too, as the pilgrims who returned from the Holy Land wore in their hat a cockle shell picked up on the shores of Palestine. Shakespeare probably alluded to this custom when he wrote:— “ How should I your true love know From another one ? By his cockle, hat, and staff And his sandal shoon.” Cocoa.—This is a beverage suited to persons in whom tea and coffee produce nervous derangement.

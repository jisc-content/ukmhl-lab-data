|_TRI 285 TREj Pigs’ tongues are generally rolled three or four to- gether, and make an appetising breakfast dish. Treacle.—This is a thick, dark-coloured syrup/ also called. molasses, formed during the manufac- ture of moist sugar, chiefly consumed by the poorer classes, who: often use it in place of butter on bread. It is occasionally used for making puddings, when it forms a substitute for fruit or jam. The use of it instead of gravy with the plain light dumplings of Norfolk is very common throughout that county. Treacle is nourishing as an article .of food, and possesses an agreeable flavour, but.,if 'too much be used, it is apt to become very heating do tho system. Treacle posset is made by boiling a little treacle in milk, and is taken as a household remedy for a cold, which it often cures, by promoting per- spiration. Trifle.—A sweet dish, the name of which by no means corresponds with the trouble and expense of making it, but in order not to trifle with the defini- tion, a short recipe for making one, is given here. “ Sponge and almond cakes, soaked in wine and brandy, are placed in a dish with layers of jam, almonds, or similar ingredients. Over these is poured a custard of eggs and milk and, on the top, whipped cream and eggs.” A great, variety of trifles may be made, though the principle will be the same in all. Tripe.—By tripe was originally meant the intes- tines ; it is now understood to be the large stomach of some ruminating,animal, principally the bullock. When cooked it is very easily digested, and is said to have great nourishing and invigorating pro- perties. Various dishes are made of it, and being moderate in price, it is a great favourite with many.

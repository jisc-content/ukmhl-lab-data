YAM] 30 G [yea where forests of beech wood cover large tracts of ground, these birds haunt them in myriads, and when they go out to feed frequently cover more than a mile of ground. They are wonderful gormandisers, 1,020 grains of corn having been found in the crop of one killed in Forfarshire. The bird is known to feed three times daily, and the loss to agriculturists which their visits cause must be very great. It, however, devours the seeds of an immense number of weeds, which serves in some degree to atone for its misdeeds. Yams.—These tropical vegetables are not much eaten in England, where they are too often con- founded with sweet potatoes. They are natives of the warmer regions of both the Northern and South- ern hemispheres, and many of them are of value, as their tubers contain a large amount of starch, though not so much as potatoes. The Chinese yam will grow in Great Britain, but, as its enormous tubers descend to a great depth, its cultivation is unprofitable. Yeast.—Also called Balm. The scum which rises when farinaceous and vegetable substances are in a state of fermentation with water. Yeast is added to substances intended to ferment, in order to quicken the process. Bough made with a certain proportion of yeast, and allowed to stand, becomes what is technically called sponge, and in baking, develops carbonic acid gas, which makes the bread lighter, but takes away some of its saccharine matter. The consumption of yeast is so great in this country that, besides the quantity supplied by English brewers, large quantities are imported from Holland and Germany.

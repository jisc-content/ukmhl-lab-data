Many of the houses are cut out of the solid salt, and when illuminated present a gorgeous appearance of fairy palaces. Beautiful little toys of all kinds are made out of this rock salt, which command a ready and extensive sale throughout Galicia.

The largest mines of rock salt in this country are in Cheshire and Derbyshire, first discovered at Northwich, in 1670. In 1832, and several successive years,'the liver W eaver, a tributary of the Mersey, carried 434,o29 tons of salt from Cheshire to Liverpool. The salt springs of Cheshire are now more produc- tive than the mines of rock salt; the most im- portant salt springs in England are at Droitwich, in Worcestershire, where, as well as at Northwich, the pumping up of immense quantities of brine has so undermined the surface of the earth as to cause serious subsidences of the ground in the streets, rendering the position of numerous houses exceed- ingly dangerous. A syndicate was recently formed among English manufacturers of salt for controlling the market, and for other purposes, but the public voice raised so loud an outcry that they were de- terred from raising the price so much as it wras feared they would have done.

In 1798 a duty of 10s. per bushel was imposed on all salt produced in this country ; in 1805 this was increased to 15s. per bushel, but in 1825 the tax

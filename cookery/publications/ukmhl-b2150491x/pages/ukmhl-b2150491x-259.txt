Quarter of Lamb.—When lambs have grown to a large size they are divided in the same manner as sheep, but early in the season small lambs are cut up into “ quarters.” The forequarters contain a leg with one side of the neck and breast, while each hind quarter contains a leg and loin. As the season advances the quarter is divided into two parts, each of which is sold as a half-quarter of lamb.

Although their flavour is too harsh for eating raw, yet tarts, preserves, and marmalade may be made with them, and a little quince added to an apple pie will greatly improve its flavour. A single quince kept by itself sheds a pleasant aroma for some distance round, but if many are together in a close room they emit a sickly, disagreeable smell. The ancient Greeks made a preserve by boiling this fruit, w’itli its branches and leaves, in honey or sweet wine. Botanists call the tree Pyrns Cydonia, from Cydon in Crete, where the tree was found growing wild. It was also a native of Persia, and subsequently the city of Corinth became famous for the superior quinces grown in its neighbourhood. The tree bears large pink and white blossoms, and

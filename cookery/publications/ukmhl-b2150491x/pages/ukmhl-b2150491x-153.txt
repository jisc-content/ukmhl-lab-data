Grapes.â€”This beautiful fruit grows in bunches on a vine, of which there are more than a thousand varieties, although only six pay to cultivate. Grapes, besides being very wholesome and pleasant for dessert, are specially acceptable because they are available for the winter months, when there is so little fresh fruit to be had. They can be packed in sawdust, conveyed great distances, and kept for a long time without sustaining much damage. The grape vine is a native of Greece, Asiatic Turkey, and Persia. So long ago as the time when Joshua and his companions marched from Egypt to Pales- tine, the grapes of Eschol were renowned for their size, so that when the men who went out to spy the land returned, they brought a bunch so large that it required two to carry it. At Damascus, bunches of grapes are often found weighing from twenty to thirty pounds. In 1781, a bunch was grown in this country, at Wei beck Abbey, weighing nineteen and a half pounds. A vine, planted in 1758, at Valentine House, Essex, produced annually for several years upwards of three hundredweight of grapes, and one year it bore upwards of four hundredweight. In England the vine grows trained to a wall in the open air, or inside a conservatory trained to its walls and roof. At Eastnor Castle a black Hamburg vine is cultivated to grow down the roof of a house, instead of up. It is planted at one end of the house, seventy feet long, the wall of which it fills; the main stem is carried along the ridge of the roof, which has rods branch- ing downwards from it. Erom this vine the owner has cut bunches weighing as much as six pounds.

In Bottles, 6d. and Is. each. In addition to the usual ingredients of a first-class Sauce, this one contains pure Pepsine, Nature’s remedy for indigestion—hence it is invaluable to all sufferers from that most distressing complaint, by whom it should be taken freely with every meal. The delicacy of flavour, and the richness and refined zest, com- bined in this justly-celebrated sauce, universally recommend it to the palate of the most fastidious epicure; while its judicious combination of selected aromatics proves a most grateful stimulus to the important functions of the stomach, its affluent piquancy lends a peculiar and exquisite enjoyment to the pleasures of the table. All persons wishing to enjoy good digestion should partake of it freely with their meals. IMPORTANT TEST. TAKE A HARD-BOILED EGG, separate the white from the yolk, break up the white as if masticated, add to it two table-spoonfuls of LORIMER’S PEPSINE SAUCE diluted with an equal quanity of water, mix well and allow the mixture to stand at a temperature of 130 deg. Fah. for a few hours, when it will be found that most, if not all, of the egg has disappeared—has actually been digested as in the living stomach ; a similar result will occur if shreds of beef finely minced are used instead of white of egg. A sauce which does not answer this test is useless, and the only one in the world which will is LORIMER’S PEPSINE SAUCE- From “CHEMIST & DRUGGIST,” Nov. ISth, 1873. “Mr. Lorimer has conceived the happy thought of introducing a ‘Pepsine Sauce.' The idea seems to be excellent. There is no doubt that the Pepsine does possess great virtue, and we have satisfied ourselves that LORIMER S SAUCE con- tains a fair proportion of this product Nothing could be easier or more natural than to take Pepsine in this form, and we may add, that the Sauce is also of an agreeable and piquant flavour.” Dr. SCHACHT, President of the “ Apotheker Verein,” in a paper read before that scientific body at Berlin, in 1873, referred to LORIMER S SAUCE in terms of the highest praise, and recommended it in preference to any other form of Pepsine wines, essences, &c.

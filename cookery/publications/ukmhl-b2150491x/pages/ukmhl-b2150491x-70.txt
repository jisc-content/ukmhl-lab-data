generally eaten salted, and is preferred by many even to the round of beef. British Wines.—These are made from a great variety of fruits, and from a few vegetable products. They do not contain so much alcohol as foreign wines, but are less likely to injure the constitution than most of the artificial concoctions sold as cheap port or sherry. British wines are of two kinds : those made in large quantities by manufacturers, and those made in private houses, called home-made. The purity of the latter can, of course, be more relied upon; and when their natural fermentation is complete before bottling, and they are allowed to mature, home-made wines form a very pleasant and wholesome beverage. There is a great variety of these wines ; ginger is one of the most popular. Cowslip wine is flavoured with the flowers of the plant of that name, called in Cambridgeshire, pegles. In that county the village children often go about selling this home-made wine, singing as they go :— “Here’s jour pegle-wine, Yery good, and very fine.” Large quantities of British wine are made from raisins, but the flavour is rather harsh and acid, and decidedly inferior to that made from grapes. On the contrary, sloe wine, made from the sloe berries, when kept for several years, acquires a flavour resembling that of port. An excellent wine for mulling, or for making negus, is obtained from elderberries. Wines are made from blackberries, currants (black or red), grapes, gooseberries, parsnips, turnips and rhubarb. The latter, if properly matured, can easily be mis- taken for champagne, contrary to the general opinion that gooseberry only possesses this quality.

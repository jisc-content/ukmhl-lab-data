Nevertheless it is enjoyed by many after it has been broiled, fried, pickled, potted, or smoke-dried. On the 9th of November a dish of sprats, supposed to be the first of the season, is always placed on the Lord Mayor’s table at the Mansion House. They are seldom more than four to five inches long, and the bones are so fine, that, however cooked, the fish is usually eaten entire, excepting the head and tail. Sprats are of a migratory nature, and are caught in great abundance on the coasts of Essex, Suffolk and Kent, being often so plentiful as to be sold for farming purposes at about sixpence a bushel. During the spawning season sprats swim together in vast shoals ; the mode of catching them is the same as that employed for herrings. Spring of Pork.—This is the under part of the animal, and includes the breast and .belly. Cut down the centre it makes two joints, each containing a portion of the ribs.

Spring Onions.—These are sown in November, and are ready for pulling by the following April.

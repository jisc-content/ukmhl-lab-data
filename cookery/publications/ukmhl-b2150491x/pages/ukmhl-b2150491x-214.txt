The trees growing there at present are said to be the same then planted, which is probable enough when we consider the great age to which the mulberry tree will grow. There is also a celebrated mulberry tree in the grounds attached to Trinity College, Cambridge, which was planted by the illustrious Sir Isaac Newton, and this tree still continues to bear fruit. Mullet (Grey).— This fish abounds on the sandy coasts of Great Britain, and is particularly plentiful on our southern shores; it still enjoys considerable favour as an article of food, but is not so much sought for as the striped red. It is a good plan to keep it in ponds as much as possible, for this always improves its flavour, more so, indeed, than in any other salt-water fish. Grey mullet has a very curious mode of feeding ; it lives chiefly on soft organic substances, which are found mixed with . weeds and sand ; in attempting to swallow these it

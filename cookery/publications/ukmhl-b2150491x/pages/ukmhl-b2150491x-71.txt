BROj 37 [Elio Brocoli.—A lmrdy variety of the cauliflower. There are two kinds : one which is ready for use in the autumn, and the other an early spring vegetable; both are equally good. Like the cauliflower, brocoli is only a cultivated form of the wild cabbage, and until the end of the seventeenth century, these were not much grown in England. The leaves of the brocoli and the colour of its head differ from that of the cauliflower. It is very easy to grow, and endures the frost without sustaining any injury, but it re- quires plenty of manure, constant watering and good, rich soil. It may be grown, however, in the open, and does not require sheltering from the wind. Like all other green vegetables for table, it should always be gathered fresh. All leaves in the least withered should be carefully picked oft’, and the brocoli should then be washed well in salt water and boiled in an uncovered saucepan. The heads of brocoli plants are often pickled like cauliflowers, and form a very tasty accompaniment to cold meats. Broiling.—To cook over the fire by direct heat. Broiling can be performed upon the wood, charcoal or coals of a slow fire, and this is still done by savages ; but in civilised countries, a gridiron, con- sisting of bars of iron, is placed over the fire for the meat to rest upon. Broiling imparts a burnt flavour to meat, which is as much liked by some as it is disliked by others. Lexicographers make no differ- ence between broiling and grilling; but a scientific chef defines the former as cooking by dry heat over the fire, and the latter as performing the same process in front of it. The modern gas-fires, being free from smoke, are well adapted for broiling. Brose. Brose is a Scotch dish made by pouring boiling water, or the liquid that meat has been

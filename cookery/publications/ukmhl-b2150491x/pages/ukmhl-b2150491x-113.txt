79 '\_CRA. ci:a] Cranberry.—This fruit grows in a cold climate, and on peaty bogs or marshy ground. The small, pink, juicy berries are very acid, and are highly valued as an anti-scorbutic, being easily kept fresh and good. They are chiefly used for tarts, but jellies and other preparations are also made from them. In Siberia they are used to manufacture a wine, and an unfermented beverage made from them is sold in the streets of St. Petersburg. Large quantities of this fruit may be collected in a few parts of Britain and of Germany, but they are chiefly imported from Pmssia and North America. When gathered by a rake, and sent over in tubs, they often arrive crushed and bruised, but this method of gathering them is going out of use, and they are now chiefly picked by hand and sent in a sounder condition to this country. In Aberdeen and some other parts of Scotland, the red berries of the whortleberry or cowberry are sold under the name of cranberries. Crawfish.—It has been a disputed point amongst the learned, whether the crayfish and the crawfish were two different kinds of fish, or whether the two names were given to one. A large number of authorities write as if either name embraced both. Amongst these are dictionaries by Webster, Wor- cester, and the “ Encyclopaedic Dictionary;” the “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” the “Penny Cyclo- paedia,” Chambers’s “ Cyclopaedia,” and the “ Globe Cyclopaedia;” Wood’s “Natural History,” Bell’s “ History of British Crustacea,” Rolleston’s “Forms of Animal Life,” Jones’s “Outline of the Organisa- tion of the Animal Kingdom,” Milne-Edwards’ “ Manual of Zoology,” Hoevens’ “ Handbook of Zoology,” the “ Histoire Naturelle de Crustaces,”

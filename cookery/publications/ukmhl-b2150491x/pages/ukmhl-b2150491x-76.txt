in’Rj !cut 42 Burgundy.—Burgundy is a French wine, named after the province so called ; and, in common with other French wines, finds great favour with English people. It is a light wine, having been allowed to complete its fermentation naturally, and is a favour- ite at the luncheon table, being often recommended to persons of weak digestion. If exposed to the air for any length of time, it becomes sour, and there- fore should not be decanted more than an hour or so before use. Butter.—This almost universal article of food is made from milk, or rather from cream, agitated until the fatty portion separates. Butter was dis- covered at a very early period, and in the first century of the present era Pliny refers to it as to an article of everyday use. “Butter,” he says, “is made from milk, and the use of this aliment, so much sought after by barbarous nations, distin- guished the rich from the common people. It is obtained principally from cows’ milk, that from ewes being the richest; goats also supply some. It is produced by agitating the milk, with a little water added, in long vessels with narrow openings.” About a century later Dioscorides noticed that butter was replacing oil at meals; and Galen praised its medi- cinal qualities. There are many kinds of butter at the present day, which take rank in the market ac- cording to their quality. Butter is affected by the kind of pasture the cows are fed upon, and the method by which the butter itself is made. The best is that produced from pure cream, and this akways commands the highest price. Butterine.—(See Margarine.) Butter-milk.—That portion of the cream that is left after the butter has been made from it. Vv hen

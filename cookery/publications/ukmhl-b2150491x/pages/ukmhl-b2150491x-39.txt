It is also obtained from the coasts of France, Portugal and Spain. A Neither is it absent from our own shores, the Channel Islands, the British Channel, and the Hampshire coast, each having yielded a certain quantity. Indeed, a practical writer on the subject has expressed his opinion that if the anchovy fishery were properly developed by us the British market might be fully supplied from our own seas. In colour the anchovy is of a bluish green on the back and upper part of the head ; the fins are tinged with green beautifully transparent, and the remainder of the body silvery white, the length varying from five to seven inches. Anchovies are principally caught at night-time, lights being used to decoy the fish into the nets. Its powerful and unique flavour causes this fish to be highly esteemed. It makes excellent sauce, the trimmings and inferior parts being chiefly used for this purpose. Sprats and other small fish are often palmed off upon the public by unscrupulous tradesmen in place of the real article. The anchovy differs in its appearance and character according to its habitat. The Gorgona fish are considered the best, while the Dutch, Bussian, and Norwegian varieties are distinguished by having no scales. Gorgona anchovies are imported both in brine and in oil, the Dutch in brine only, the Russian in brine and highly spiced vinegar, the Norwegian in spiced brine. In this way can be suited the various tastes of consumers in all parts of the world. Ancient Wines.—Wine was known in the very

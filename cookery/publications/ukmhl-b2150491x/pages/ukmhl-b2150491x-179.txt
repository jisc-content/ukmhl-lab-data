The name is sometimes spelt catchup, or catsup, and it is supposed to have been derived from the Japanese word, kitchap.

After two or three days the action of the salt upon the mushrooms reduces nearly the whole mass to a liquid state. Mixed spice containing cloves, allspice, and black pepper is added to this liquor, which is then boiled down to half its original bulk. Tomato ketchup is made in a similar way from tomatoes. Walnut ketchup is made from unripe walnuts, while the outer shell is still soft, and will keep in prime condition for years. Other kinds of ketchup are made, such as those prepared from oysters, mussels, and other shell-fisli, but the distinctive feature of all varieties of this sauce is, that they are made from the juice of the article after which they are named, flavoured with salt, mixed spice, and also vinegar when the juice em- ployed is not itself acidulous.

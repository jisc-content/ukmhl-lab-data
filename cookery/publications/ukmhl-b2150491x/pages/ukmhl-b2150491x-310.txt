TAM J [tap 27 6 native of that part of Africa extending from Abyssinia southwards to the Zambesi. The name means, in Arabic, “ Indian date,” which shows that it was originally imported from India, where it is valued not only for its pulp but also for its seeds, which are astringent. The leaves also fur- nish a yellow or red dye. The tree attains a height of seventy or eighty feet, and bears elegant, feathery foliage, with purplish or orange-veined flowers, arranged in terminal clusters. Owing to the pecu- liar stamens, ovaries and petals, it is assumed that insects are necessary to the fertilisation of the flower. Tammy.—A cloth sieve for straining broth and sauces. Tapioca.—Highly recommended for the diet of invalids and children; generally considered more easy of digestion than any other kind of farinaceous food, and less liable to produce acidity. Whether boiled in water or milk, or steeped in boiling water and then baked, it forms, when sweetened and flavoured to taste, a very palatable, light and nu- tritious article of food ; it is also sometimes used for thickening soups and stews. It is prepared from the root of the cassava, or manioc plant, which grows in the tropical parts of America, Asia and Africa. When the root is freshly cut, a milky juice exudes, which is highly poisonous ; but when this juice is removed, the remainder of the root yields this starchy product, which retains no deleterious property whatsoever. It presents the appearance of small, irregular-shaped, agglomerate masses, dis- tinguishing it from the regular-shaped grains of sago, which, in its other properties, it closely re- sembles. Our chief supplies of tapioca are imported from Brazil. A

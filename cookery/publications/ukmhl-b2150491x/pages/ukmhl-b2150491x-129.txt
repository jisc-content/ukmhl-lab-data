EDl] 95 [EDI cacies. As the white are found in the proportion of only one to twenty-five, they are thought much more of than the black, which are generally sent to Ba- tavia, where they are converted into glue. Edible Frogs.—These frogs are eaten in France and the South of Germany. The hind legs are con- sidered a great delicacy, a taste which has found its votaries even in England. They are described by Frank Buckland as being “ Most excellent eat- ing, tasting more like the delicate flesh of the rabbit than anything else I could think of.” The edible frog is found in England, Southern Europe, and other parts of the temperate zones. The male has a bladder-like pouch to his cheek, which it distends in the act of croaking, making a much louder noise than common frogs, and for this reason it has been called on the Continent the “ Dutch Nightin- gale,” and in our own country the “ Cambridgeshire Nightingale.” It is eaten by birds, reptiles and some mammals. This species does not exist in America, where its place is taken by the bull-frog, which closely resembles it. Edible Snails.—The edible snail of the Con- tinent differs from our usual garden snail in colour and size, for it has a shell measuring two inches every way. Though not eaten much in this country, snails are looked upon as delicacies in China and France. The luxurious Homans thought very highly of them, and had enclosures made for them in which they could be fattened on a certain kind of meal, and wine that had been boiled. It is said that as far back as the seventeenth century the edible snail of the South of Europe was brought to this country, and that its descendants are still found here in districts where chalk abounds.

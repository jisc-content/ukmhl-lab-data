158 lim] [liq Limpet. These shell-fish are occasionally used for food, and can be prepared for table like cockles and other bivalves. The limpet has only one shell, which is convex without and concave within. In some species the top of the shell is entire, in others it is perforated. Limpets are found on the sea- shore, adhering to the rocks, which they do so tightly that they can only be detached by inserting a knife under the shell. Ling.— Ling is a fish of the same species as hake, and like that fish is both cheap and nourish- ing. It is a native of the northern seas, the Orkneys, the Yorkshire and Cornish coasts, as well as off the Scilly Islands. In form it is not unlike the cod, but it is more slender and grows to the length of six or seven feet. Its colour is grey, inclining to olive, and it feeds principally on smaller fish. Though little used in England, yet when less than twenty-six inches long they are called drizzles, and these are eaten and relished by the inhabitants of the Yorkshire coast. When large, ling are coarse, and are salted, dried, and exported to Spain, and other Southern parts of Europe, where the fresh fish are not met with. The sounds and roes are salted separately; the liver yields an oil similar to cod-liver oil, which is used by the poor for the cottage lamps, and as a medicine by those who have been able to overcome the repugnance arising from its nauseous smell and taste.

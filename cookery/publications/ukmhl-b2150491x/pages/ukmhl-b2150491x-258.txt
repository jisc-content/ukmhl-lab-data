pur] 224 [QUA even now certain punches retain their celebrity, as “ Scotch,” “ Norfolk,” and “ Milk Punch.” Puree.—Meat or vegetable made into a pulp, and reduced to the consistence of soup. Pulled. Bread.—4s esteemed a choice morsel for eating with cheese, or with wine instead of biscuits. The crumb of an under-baked loaf is pulled out with the fingers in small pieces while the bread is hot, these are then put into the oven again to hake till they become crisp, and of a delicate brown tint. The more irregular the pieces pulled out of the loaf the better will be the pulled-bread after the second baking. Quail.—Is a small brown bird of the partridge tribe, unsocial in its habits, visiting England in the summer. Enormous numbers of these birds arrive on the shores of the Mediterranean, from Africa, to the extent of 100,000 in a single day, and are trapped and distributed thence throughout Europe, the flesh being delicate and much in de- mand for epicures. It was this bird that supplied the Israelites with food in the desert, and in later Eoman times we hear of it, not only as used for food, but also from the sport obtained owing to the pugnacity displayed by the males, who were backed one against the other. This practice is still main- tained by the Italians and Chinese, and the latter have a small species which they keep in cages, for the novel purpose of warming the hands of their owners in winter. Quails feed at night on insects and seeds, but during the day they conceal them- selves and go to roost in the long grass. In autumn the birds return with their young (then about six weeks old) to southern climes, even as far as South Africa.

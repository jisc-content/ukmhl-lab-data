bul] 41 [bur and is said to be equal to bare if it is bung for a time, although not often included in cookery of a high class. It is best roasted, and should be stuffed with veal forcemeat, rather highly seasoned, tied over with paper, and hasted well while roasting. The remains furnish excellent materials for an economical made dish. Heart requires to be served very hot, as it is a meat that soon chills. Bull’s-eyes.— The name given to sweetmeats made of boiled sugar, flavoured with various essences, coloured and moulded in round pieces the size of a bullet. Bull’s-eyes are one of the oldest sweetmeats, and, although the variety of confectionery has so largely increased during recent years, they still find a place in the young folk’s list of delicacies. Buns.—Buns are a form of bread very familiarly known at most tables. They are light and spongy, not baked hard and dry, as biscuits are. The baking involves three distinct processes—the setting of the sponge, making the dough or kneading, and baking or firing. Buns are extensively eaten in England, the Bath bun being much appreciated. As is well known, a special bun is made for Good Friday with the distinctive mark of a cross, and known as “ hot cross buns.” So great is the demand for these that in many bake-houses the men work all the night preceding the festival. Burdwan.—A dish much appreciated by Anglo- Indians. Almost any kind of cold meat may be used for making it, but preference is given to veni- son or poultry. A sauce for it is made by boiling minced onions and shalots in water, flavoured with cayenne and essence of anchovies, thickened with a little butter and flour, in which the meat is placed until thoroughly warmed.

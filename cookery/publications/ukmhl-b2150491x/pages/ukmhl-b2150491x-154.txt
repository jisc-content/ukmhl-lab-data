120 [gra gra] In warmer climates large numbers of grapes grow together in vineyards, like trees in an orchard. On the banks of the Rhine, in France, and in Spain, the vine is extensively cultivated for the production of wine. In recent years grapes have been largely cultivated on the western shores of Central America, in Chili, and in some parts of Australia, for the making of wine, which possesses the advantage of not being fortified. Gratin.—Grated bread strewed over meat, fish, macaroni, cheese, or similar dishes, and browned. Gravy.—This word properly means the juice of meat which comes from it while it is being cooked. It is generally made into a kind of sauce by the addition of water, thickening (see the article under that name), burnt sugar, or other colouring matter, and seasoning. As some meats do not afford much juice of their own, gravies are often made from shin of beef and similar materials, when the gravy partakes of the character of stock. Grayling.—Belongs to the same family as the salmon and the trout. It is a silver-scaled fish, pretty and palatable, found in rivers in the North of England, and often weighs as much as five pounds, though more usually from two to three. It is more elongated and more slender than the trout, which it resembles, and has a small head, is silvery grey at the sides with dark stripes; some- times it is black about the head and down the back. Its flesh is firm and tasty. The best season for angling it is September, October, and November. It frequents the rivers of Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Hampshire, and Wiltshire, beside several other En- glish and Welsh rivers. It is found neither in Ireland nor Scotland, but is plentiful in Sweden, Norway,

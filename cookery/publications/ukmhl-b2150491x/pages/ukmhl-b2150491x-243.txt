It is now extensively cultivated in this country, and is gi;own in large glass conservatories, commonly to a weight of eight pounds ; but some have been known to weigh from thirteen to fourteen pounds each. It is sometimes made into marmalade and jam, or pre- served in syrup hermetically sealed in tins or bottles.

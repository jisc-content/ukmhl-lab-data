[bar bar] 17 with barley boiled in milk till it is quite tender; and a broth is made with the shin of beef and barley. Pearl barley is barley deprived of its outer husky covering, rounded, and polished in a mill; this is used for making barley water and for thickening soups. Barley Sugar.—A sweetmeat which is some- times made by heating refined sugar to a tem- perature of 160° C. (320° F.), when it melts into a clear fluid which solidifies on cooling into a yellowish non-crystalline mass. It is also made by boiling fine sugar with a very small quan- tity of water till the added water has been all evaporated, skimming off the scum that rises to the surface. It is usually flavoured with essence of lemon or lemon juice. A little fresh butter is rubbed upon a stone or marble slab, upon which, when the sugar is boiled sufficiently, it is poured out; before it gets quite cold it may be easily twisted into the spiral forms in which it is usually seen. It derives its name from the fact that it was originally made with a decoction of barley instead of the plain water mentioned above. Baron of Beef.—Part of the back of an ox, consisting of two sirloins undivided. It is a hand- some joint, but rather difficult to roast. Its principal recommendation is that meat can be cut from it extremely underdone or extremely well- done. It is now occasionally seen at banquets of a convivial character, though in former days it was more frequently introduced and invariably formed , part of the feast given when the heir of a country gentleman came of age. It generally appears at the Lord Mayors’ banquets, and also forms part of Her Majesty’s Christmas dinner.

It is then shovelled into a large wooden box, called a couch, where it remains for twenty-four hours to further advance the germi- nation. The grain is then laid out on a wooden floor, and shovelled daily until the germination is equal throughout the entire quantity. It is then thrown into a kiln at a temperature of 90°, gradu-

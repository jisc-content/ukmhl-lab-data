ciu] with oil anil vinegar. The crab is voracious and kcen-scenteil, and, possessing remarkably strong and sharp claws, is enabled to act as a sort of sca- venger of the ocean, quickly disposing of all the decaying animal matter with which the deep abounds. Once a year, the crab, retiring to the hiding-places among the rocks or concealing itself under large stones, performs the feat of changing its shell. Crackers.—A name given to hard biscuits. They are occasionally used in cookery, and when soaked, and flavoured with lemon or spices, are made into pies; crumbled, they can also be made into pudding. The name cracker is also given to ornamental cases of paper or gelatine, containing two strips of cardboard joined in the centre by a material which explodes when the strips of card- board are pulled apart. In the interior of these crackers is generally placed a bonbon, round which is wrapped a piece of paper bearing a couplet, and outside a grotesque head-dress of tissue paper. The crackers are intended to be pulled apart by two persons, one of whom becomes the fortunate pos- sessor of the sweetmeat, and the other of only the paper cap. Cracknels.—Biscuits made of paste which is boiled before it is baked. The paste consists of flour, butter, yolk of egg, water and a little flavour- ing. It is cut into triangular or oval pieces, which slightly curl up when boiled. After boiling they are put into cold water to harden, dried, and finally baked. Cracknels easily crumble when broken, and, being extremely dry, are not easily eaten without a liquid accompaniment. Hence they are generally taken with wine or similar beverages.

[red red] 229 Red Cabbage.—A species'of the common cabbage with reddish leaves, chiefly used for pickling. When cut into narrow shreds, and allowed to lie two or three days with salt sprinkled over it before adding the vinegar, it will acquire a beautiful purple colour, and with the addition of spices and vinegar it makes a cheap and pleasant pickle. In Germany, and some- times in this country, it is eaten as a vegetable when stewed in gravy or butter, -with vinegar and spice. Red cabbage should not be cut until it has been slightly frost-bitten. Red Grouse.—This bird, sometimes called the red ptarmigan, or moor-fowl, is considered to have an exquisite flavour; it is generally roasted, but is cooked in several other ways. Its colour is a rich chestnut-brown, striped with black; it is peculiar to the British Islands, and more especially to Scotland and Wales ; it inhabits the heathery hills and moors, where it feeds on berries and the tender shoots of heather. In winter red grouse is usually found in flocks of forty or fifty, called by sportsmen “packs,” which become remarkably shy and wild. They make their nest of grass and ling stems, interspersed with twigs and feathers. The shooting season commences on the twelfth of August, when the young birds are strong enough on the wing to afford good sport. —(See Grouse.)

Tii the 'winter they retire to deep waters, but during the warmer months they are caught in large numbers near the coast, and the best are caught in the English Channel. They begin to spawn in June, and five hundred and forty thousand eggs have been counted in a single roe. Madeira Wine.-This is a dry wine, slightly acid and astringent, as strong as sherry, which it somewhat resembles, but having a more delicate flavour and aroma. The vine is supposed to have been first planted in Madeira, about the year 1450, by order of the celebrated Prince Henry of Portugal, but it was nearly two hundred years later before its trade in wine commenced. The excellence of the Madeira grapes is due to the volcanic nature of the soil, and to the vines being trained to grow over a low lattice-work of cane, instead of climbing up lofty trees. The best grapes are grown on the south side of the island, those on the north being only fit for brandy. When newly made the wine is subjected to artificial heat, and it improves greatly by age, which has been proved by samples from fifty to one r hundred years old. At one period it was chiefly exported to the East and West Indies, where it has long been specially esteemed, and as it is greatly improved by a voyage to a warm climate, it was generally sent there before it was brought to England. In 1785 one hundred and twenty thousand gallons, and in 1820 five hundred and twenty thousand gallons were shipped to this country, but in 1852, through the ravages of the oidium Tuckeri, the trade decreased considerably; it is now, however, again gradually increasing.

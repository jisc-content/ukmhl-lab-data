LAR] 151 [LAR the long grass with wonderful rapidity. Its cry can he so exactly imitated by drawing a quill or knife sharply across the teeth of a comb or a screw, that the bird may be decoyed until quite close to the operator. So averse is this bird to rising on the wing that a dog is frequently employed to hunt it. Lard.—This is the inner fat of the pig melted down in a jar placed in boiling water; when melted it is poured into bladders for future use. Lard is much used for many culinary purposes, and may be pre- served in salt, which will not penetrate it, and when the salt is washed off can be used as well as if it were freshly made. Larding,—Lean meat is often improved by the introduction of a little fat, and for this purpose bacon is most generally used. The bacon should be cut into pieces about two inches long, not quite one quarter of an inch wide, and of the same thickness. These pieces are inserted into the fowl or other meat to be larded, by means of a larding needle, which varies in size from five to twelve inches long, and is split into four at one end. Into the cleft thus formed a piece of bacon is inserted, the needle is then pushed through the meat to be larded, and as it is withdrawn, leaves the bacon behind. To facili- tate the art of larding, as it it called by some chefs, boiling water should be poured over the flesh of the poultry or game, or it may be placed for the space of a minute before the fire. This will make the flesh firm to admit the larding needle more easily. Care should be taken in the choice of bacon, because if cured with saltpetre, it will discolour the flesh wherever it is inserted. Lardoons.

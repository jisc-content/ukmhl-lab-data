Bullace.—A kind of plum, so much like the damson that Hogg, in his “ Fruit Manual,” says: “ The difference between these two fruits is little more than a name ; the round ones being bullaces, and the oval ones damsons.” The bullace, how- ever, has not the pleasant roughness of taste so characteristic of the damson. There are some varie- ties of a yellowish white colour and others of a bluish black. They ripen later in the season than most plums, and are remarkable because of the im- mense quantity of fruit which each tree usually bears. The bullace-tree is a native of Asia Minor and Southern Europe, but has been for many cen- turies cultivated in more northern countries. It is occasionally found growing wild in the south-western parts of England. The cultivation of so many new varieties of plum has somewhat crowded out the bullace, so that it is less patronised now than for- merly, the memory of living men sufficing to mark a rapid decline in its use. The numerous references to the bullace in the writings of early English authors prove that it was in very common use among our forefathers. Lydgate uses the phrase, “As bright as bullaces,” in a poem published more than four hundred years ago. There is a tree in the West Indies which produces a green egg-shaped fruit, with a pleasant, vinous, aromatic flavour, that is also called the bullace. The same name is also given to the muscadine grape of the United States. Bullock.—(See Ox.) Bullock’s Heart.— The heart of the ox is a favourite dish with some persons in cold weather,

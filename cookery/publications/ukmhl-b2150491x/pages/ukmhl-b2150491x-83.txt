The last seen in Scotland was shot in 1760. Capers.—The unopened flower-buds of a creep- ing plant which grows wild among the rocks of Greece and Northern Africa, and now cultivated in the South of Europe.

In Germany, capers are chopped up with anchovies and spice, and are then spread as a paste on rusks, bread-and-butter, or toast.

IRl] 140 [isi Irish Moss.—Also called Carragheen. The jelly made from it is tonic, demulcent, and expectorant, without producing nausea. It forms a most ex- cellent diet for aged, asthmatic, nervous, and bilious invalids, very soothing in all irritable conditions of the throat and alimentary canal. Irish moss grows in great abundance on the coasts of Ire- land, especially on the northern shore of Donegal Bay; it is also found on the Atlantic coasts of France, Spain, and Portugal, and on the shores of several of the Western Islands of Scotland. It might afford a valuable industry on the western coasts of Ireland if the peasantry of those districts would but give more attention to its collection, drying, and preparation for commerce. Isinglass.—This is a kind of gelatine made from the sound or swimming-bladder of the sturgeon and certain other fishes. This air-bladder is attached to the back-bone and continued between the ribs, so that being filled with air it increases the buoyancy of the fish when swimming. When prepared for use it is split up into long, thin, narrow lengths. Origin- ally isinglass was made solely from the sound of the sturgeon, and all our supplies were imported from Russia and Brazil, but now it is prepared from the sound of various fishes, and we import it from many other countries. A very interesting account of the origin of its manufacture from the air-bladder of the cod-fish will be found in the “ Philosophical Trans- actions ” for 1773. Isinglass is transparent, dry, tasteless, inodorous, and whitish in colour. It forms a clearer, purer, more palatable and more elegant jelly than ordinary gelatine. The jelly made from isinglass is a very light, digestible, nutrient, and demulcent article of diet, specially suited for invalids

Clams.—About fifty species of clams are known, which are all natives of warm and tropical seas, and are thought highly of as articles of food. Their shells are attached by the external surface to sub- marine bodies, such as coral rocks. For shape, they depend upon the body to which they are at- tached, and their colour varies as they are exposed to a greater or lesser light. The best known and most highly estimated are the American or round clam, and the giant clam. The latter attains a great size, and sometimes weighs five hundred pounds with the shell, and twenty pounds without: it is found on the shores of the Indian seas, where the natives consider it a great delicacy and eat it raw. The bivalves called clams which are found on the British coast are nearly oval in shape, and of a rich purple colour. The ordi- nary size of these is two inches by one and a half inches. They are well-flavoured and made up in various ways for consumption. Claret.—A name given to the red wines produced in the country around Bordeaux. They vary greatly in quality, according to the season and the precise locality in which they are made; but the produce of each vineyard usually retains its own special cha- racteristics.

IX INTRODUCTION. selfish enough to find a relish in such eccentricities themselves. It is recorded that the famed .ZEsop had a pie made of birds that could imitate human voices, at a cost of £5,000. Clodius, his son, peppered his drink with powdered pearls, and refused the most dainty mixture unless his cook could assure him that a precious stone was one of its ingredients. Helio- gabalus delighted in salmagundi made of the tongues and brains of small birds with musical voices or brilliant plumage; and Septimius had a hotch- potch made of meats irrespective of their flavour so long as the names began with the same letters of the alphabet. It is also said that Cleopatra dissolved a pearl valued at £80,000 and then drank the solution. Further, it is stated that in more modern times such vagaries occurred rather with a view of boasting than otherwise. Such was the case when Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Ex- change, powdered a precious stone of the value of £15,000, and drank it in a glass of wine to the health of Queen Elizabeth, in order to astonish the Ambassador of Spain, with whom he had laid a wager that he would give a more costly dinner than the Spaniard could do. This was an exceptional case ; but during the time that great extravagances were carried on in Rome things were very different in Britain. When the Romans invaded this country they found the living of the inhabitants very simple, but otherwise plentiful. Their meals consisted of roast or boiled meat, game or fish, and a very few vegetables indeed. In fact, it is to the Romans that we. owe the introduction of many vegetables and fruits now so abundantly cultivated to luxurious perfection ; and this is not all for which we are in- debted to our conquerors.

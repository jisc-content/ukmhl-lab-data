Formerly there was in Berkshire a variety of the British domestic pig which had an uncleft foot, like the wild boar. This latter is, in some countries, the subject of a national sport. In Germany he is a very formidable animal, and is hunted with a small mastiff. He lives almost ex- clusively on acorns and nuts, consequently his flesh is firmer, and free from any contamination through objectionable food. In Westphalia its value is still further enhanced by the process adopted for curing the hams. Hominy.—Hominy is a food made of maize (Indian corn) boiled, the maize being either coarsely ground or broken into granules. The name is of Indian derivation, and the food is coming into use through the great association of the English people with those of Indian or quasi-Indian birth. It is very nourishing, and forms an agreeable addition to our farinaceous foods; it yields, in common with other cereals, gluten, starch and glucose. Honey.—This is an extremely sweet deposit ob- tained by bees from various kinds of flowers. They store it for their winter food in small cells of wax, called honey-combs, which they make in hollow trees or sheltered places, and for which purpose bee- hives are erected. Taken in moderate quantities, honey is nutritious, and is now eaten principally on bread-and-butter, like jam. In ancient times it w7as much more extensively used, and in the Middle Ages drinks were made from it. (See Mead.) The Spaniards make a beverage of honey and water, flavoured with lemon-juice, which they call Aloxa.

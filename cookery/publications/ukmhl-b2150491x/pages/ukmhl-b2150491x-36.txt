o [ale ait] each bottle, but too often they, like many aerated waters with fancy names, contain nothing besides the carbonic acid. Seltzer water should contain chlorides of sodium, calcium and magnesium, with phosphate and sulphate of sodium. It is named after Selters, in Nassau, where there is a natural spring containing these salts in addition to carbonic acid gas. Lemonade and other fruit beverages are made by adding fruit syrup to a simple aerated water. On a small scale for family use aerated water may be made by means of gazogenes, in which the carbonic acid is first made, and then taken up by water. The principal natural mineral or aerated waters (excluding those employed solely for medicinal purposes) are the “ iEsculap,” “ Apollinaris,” “ Salu- taris,” “Selters,” “Vichy,” “ Rossbach,” and “ Hunyadi Janos.” Amongst the favourite artificial beverages of this class may be named “ Ginger beer,” “Lemonade,” “ Bontha,” “ Zoedone.” Aitchbone of Beef,—This joint lies immedi- ately under the rump, and although not having so good an appearance, is only inferior to it in con- sequence of being not quite so tender. It is generally salted and boiled, and eaten with suet dumplings, carrots and turnips. It contains a good deal of bone, but for all that is an economical joint, as it is generally moderate in price. Ale.—(See Beer.) Alexander.—A plant, a native of Great Britain, and may be found in its wild state near the sea- coast. Its flavour is similar to that of the celery, but since the cultivation of the latter it is hardly used as an herb. The name Alexander was probably given to it in consequence of its having been origin- ally brought from Alexandria.

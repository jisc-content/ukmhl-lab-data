The tree which yields it grows wild in the forests of Paraguay, and over five million pounds are annually exported to other parts of South America, while the comsumption in Paraguay amounts to about thirteen pounds per head per annum. Small quantities of mate are imported into this country, but it has not gained here any wide-spread repute. Matelote.—This is the French word for sailor, and dishes a la matelote are based upon matelote, a sauce supposed to have derived its ndme from the relish French sailors used to add to the fish caught when out at sea. It is now made in an elaborate form, and varied according to the different dishes, but its use is generally confined to fish or calf’s head. May Drink.—A refreshing beverage of German origin, where it is largely consumed by picnic parties during the spring. It is made of hock or other light wine, flavoured principally with woodruff, although sugar, lemon and black currant leaves may be added according to taste. After the flavour- ings have been steeped in the wine, water or ice is added. Mayonnaise.—Cold viands prepared in this favourite French fashion are peculiarly welcome during the hot days of summer. The meat or fish to be dressed is cut into moderate-sized pieces and laid on a dish, surrounded by pieces of lettuce, endive or other salad ; a dressing called mayonnaise sauce is then poured over it. This dressing may be made according to most recipes for those to be used for salads, but generally a larger proportion of the hard-boiled yolk of egg is used, and lemon juice sometimes takes the place of oil.

Sugar.—This is an article of general consump- tion, its uses being important and multifarious. It was at one time obtained solely from the sweet sap of the sugar cane, but is now prepared from a num- ber of plants, and is also manufactured by the chemical conversion of starch and woody fibre. It was originally brought from the East by Nearchus, a Greek, who accompanied Alexander the Great in his voyage down the Indus. When first introduced into Western Europe in the twelfth century it was only used as a drug ; the sugar cane itself being little known until after the discovery of America, to which continent it was introduced by the Portuguese. It is now grown principally in the West Indies, where sugar is produced in great abundance at a very moderate price. In 1740 it was discovered that sugar could be obtained from the beetroot, and in the beginning of the present century, when the long naval war between France and this country had raised the price of West Indian sugar, the French commenced to manufacture it from the beet, and this industry is now extensively carried on in Ger- many also. Sugar is extracted from a species of maple in America, and this is considered by some a great delicacy. Sugar is also made from a kind of millet, from various palms, and from a flower called “ mahuae.” “ Saccharin ” is a sweet chemi- cal principle, extracted from coal-tar, which contains no sugar whatever, but is merely a substi- tute for it, possessing three-hundred times the sweetening power of sugar, half a grain being sufficient to sweeten a cup of tea or coffee.

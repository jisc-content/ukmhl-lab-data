ent] 100 which would otherwise be unattractive. The name, which is the French word for entrance, was probably originally given to these dishes in consequence of their being brought into the dining-room instead of being placed on the table at the commencement of the meal. Entrees formerly appeared with the joint as side dishes, but they now form a course of them- selves. Entremets.—Light side dishes which are served between the principal courses. Eschalot.—(See Shalot.) Essence.—The virtue extracted from any sub- stance. Essences possess the great advantage of occupying a very small space in proportion to their strength, hence they are of the greatest use to travellers in consequence of their portability ; they are also much used for flavouring. The essence of beef or chicken is principally used for making broth; essence of anchovies is largely employed in sauces, and essence of lemon to flavour confections. Essences are prepared by boiling the raw material until an extract of the required strength is obtained, but they can generally be purchased ready made. Faggots.—A cheap and substantial article of food, sold ready cooked by many of the pork butchers in London and other large towns, highly appreciated among the lower ranks of our town population. They are made with the liver of the calf or pig mixed up with fresh fat pork, bread-crumbs, onions and various flavouring herbs; a little egg should be added to make the mince adhere together. They are usually made in small squares, and must be very slowly baked. Fennel.—An aromatic plant, with yellow, um- belliferous flowers, and pretty, finely-divided leaves.

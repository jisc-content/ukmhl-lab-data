[box; 29 BOR] ache and to improve the digestive powers.—(See Aerated Waters.) Borecole or Scotch Kale.—It is a favourite kind of green vegetable in many parts of the country, and of late years its use in LoncTon and other large towns has slightly increased. It is considered a coarse kind of green, seldom used except by the humbler classes. It will thrive on many a plot of ground too poor for almost any other kind of vege- table. The Scotch used to cut it up in shreds for one of the ingredients in their favourite broth called Kale, whence their cottage gardens in which it was grown came to be called Kale yards, and the Borecole was called Scotch Kale or Kale green. Like other green vegetables, it is very good as a preventative of scurvy, and when eaten with meat counteracts its richness. Bouillabaisse.—A celebrated French soup, made from fish, of which the basis is shell-fish, prawns, cray-fish, crab or lobster. About 30 ingredients are required to produce this extraordinary compound, which counted Thackeray among its devoted ad- mirers. So highly did he prize it, that he wrote an entire ballad in its praise, and in the following verse gave a description of its appetising ingredients :— This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is, A sort of soup, a broth, or stew ; A hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes, That Greenwich never could out-do ; Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffern, Soles, onions, garlic, roach and dace, All these you eat at Ferres Tavern, In that one dish of Bouillabaisse. Bouilli.—Fresh beef boiled, generally placed on the table as a joint, accompanied by radishes, sauce, or other condiments.

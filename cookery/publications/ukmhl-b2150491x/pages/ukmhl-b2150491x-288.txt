A favourite way of cooking sheep’s kidneys is to cut them open and broil them, serving them up on broiled ham, or toast. They are also devilled, that is, seasoned with cayenne pepper, West Indian pickles, or any other pungent flavour- ing, before broiling ; kidneys are sometimes stewed with mushrooms.

ACC [ 2 ] ACC any woik where charcoal fires are used, go out into the fresh air. 5. Carefully rope trees before tlaey are cut down, that when they fall they may do no injury. 6. When henumbed with cold, beware of sleeping out of doors ; rub yourself, if you have it in your power, with snow, and do not hastily approach the fire. 7. Beware of damps. 8. Admit air into vaults by letting them remain open some time before you enter, and scatter powdered lime in them. Where a lighted candle will not burn, animal life cannot exist; it will be an excellent caution, therefore, before entering damp and confined places—as wells, privy vaults, cellars, &c.—to try this simple experiment. 9. Never leave by themselves saddle or draught Iiorses while in use, nor go immediately behind a led horse, as he is apt to kick. 10. Ride not on footways. 11. Be wary of children, whether they are up or in bed; and particularly when tliey are near the fire, an element with which they are very apt to amuse themselves. 12. Leave nothing poisonous open or ac- cessible, and never omit to write tho word Poison in large letters upon it wherever it may be placed. .13. Whenever you feel veiy uneasy, tell your distress early to a steady friend. ACCOUNTS. The following is a simple and' effective mode of keeping those relative to the household. Junk, 1857.

[ 489 ] FEM FEN have their assent to his opinion extorted by their own experience will be exceedingly cautious with regard to the characters which they either take or give. Inquire for servants either amongst your circle of friends and acquaintance, or from any respectable tradespeople you may employ, who generally know those in their neighbour- hood who are out of place, and when your wants are made known you will find applicants enough. The great object should be to hare servants who have lived in respectable and regular families, and whose habits have been so well formed that they may have but few that require improvement. Do not accept a written character from any unknown quarter, but seek an interview, if possible, with the former mistress of the servant whom you are about to engage. From her appearance and the state of her house you may draw some inference to assist your decision of the suitableness of the servant for your place. If the lady's personal appearance betray negli- gence, or her house untidiness and want of cleanliness, we may naturally conclude that her servant may have similar defects, which, for those with correct habits and notions, would render her unfit for their service. Excess in dress is the prevailing mistake made by female servants. It becomes, then, the duty of every mistress to point out to her female servants the propriety of plainness in their habiliments, and, if her instructions be not regarded, to make extravagance in this respect a serious objection to retaining them in her ser- vice. The head of a family who engages a female servant without warning her of her disapproba- tion of unsuitable dress cannot be surprised if her servant should take advantage of her in- difference and omission. A few hints, delivered in a kind and not peremptory manner, might suggest to a female servant that the following materials of dress are the most suitable to her situation, and only can be permitted Muslin, not lace caps ; cotton and stuff gowns, and petticoats of the same texture; shawls of a durable, but not of a brilliant colour; and bon- nets of straw, which may be cleaned and turned. Occasional recommendations of a simple, yet creditable style of dress may be in many in- stances extremely useful, as our inferiors some- times place great value on such proofs of approbation. Wages vary in different places. In LoTidon they are higher than elsewhere, and it is right that they should be so, as the wear of clothes is greater, and the work frequently harder. Wages differ, too, according to the rank and style of different families.

See Domestic Servants. FENNEL, PICKLED. Take some spring water, and when it boils put in the fennel tied in bunches, with some salt. Do not let it boil, but when it is of a fine green dry it on a cloth. When it is cold put it in a glass with some nut- meg and mace, fill it with cold vinegar, and put a bit of green fennel at the top. Cover it the same as all other pickles with a bladder and leather. FENNEL SAUCE (])• Slice four or five onions, and soak them in two spoonsful of oil, two of cullis, and two of white wine, with two cloves of garlic; simmer them for an hour, skim off the fat, and sift the sauce in a sieve ; then add chopped parsley and fennel, coarse pepper, and salt. Boil a minute before using it. FENNEL SAUCE (2). Pick some green fennel, mint, and parslev, a little of each ; wash them clean, and boil tlicm till tender; drain and press them, chop them finely, add melted butter, and serve up the sauce immediately, for if the herbs are mixed any length of time before being served up to table they will be dis- coloured. FENNEL WATER. This is done simply by steeping some fennel in hot water till it has the taste of the herb sufficiently; add what sugar you think proper, and keep it in a cool place a good while before using. You ma^

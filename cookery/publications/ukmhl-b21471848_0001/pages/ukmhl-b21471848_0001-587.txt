You may add caraways and sweetmeats if you choose. Make it into a stiff paste, and bake it in a slow oven. If cakes or biscuits are kept in paper or a drawer they will acquire a disagreeable taste. A pan and cover or tureen will preserve them long and moist; or, if required to be crisp, laying them before the fire will make them so. GINGERBREAD, AMERICAN.

If they should get scorched scrape off with a knife or grater all the burnt parts before you put the cakes away.

When done cut it into pieces two inches square, and while warm press them on a round stick about two inches in diameter, to give them a semicircular form. This operation should be performed as quickly as possible, that the wafers may not change colour. CURRANT, DRY, BRIOCHE.

CURRANT ICES (1). Boil 2 lbs. of red currants a moment with J lb. of raspberries ; rub them through a sieve, adding a pint of water, and then the sugar, which must be very well dissolved before icing. CURRANT ICES (2). Pick some currants from their stalks, and squeeze them through a sieve ; then take clarified sugar, boil it to a very liigh degree, add it to your currant juice, and if you choose squeeze in the juice of four lemons, as it will make it more mellow; strain it through the sieve a second time, put it in the iciug pot, and finish the same as all other ices. CURRANT JELLY (1). Set on the fire in a sugar pan a pint of smooth claiified sugar; when it boils put in a quart of picked red currants, in which let them boil for an hour.

When the juice is perfectly clear weigh it, and for each pound take i lb. of crushed sugar; put them on the fire together, and much scum will soon rise, which must all be taken off; let it remain on the fire for about an hour, and then try it as follows :â€”Put a small quantity on a very cold plate, and if when it cools it becomes thick and of proper consistence take the pan from the fire; if it is not let it remain till that is the case.

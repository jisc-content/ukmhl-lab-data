Cotton gloves are the cheapest of all, and are dyed of various colours: being warm, they are much in use for common wear. Many are im- ported from Germany of very low price. Berlin gloves are strong, and of white cotton. They wei'e originally imported from the continent, but are now made in great numbers in Not- tingham and Leicester. These and the other cotton gloves have almost driven away the common beaver. Jean, satteen, and cambric gloves are cut out of the cotton cloth of these names, and sewed to- gether : their use is confined to women. The first are strong, but the cambric gloves are bought merely for their cheapness, having nothing else to recommend them. Mittens are gloves made of various materials, of which the tips of the fingers are wanting, and are used in work that requires the points of the fingers to be uncovered. Silk gloves. These are of various qualities, determined by their weight and the neatness of workmanship. The French ivliite are the best. They are also black and coloured. A figured silk net glove has lately come much into use among ladies. It is extremely elegant and cool in summer. Gloves are now also made remarkably cheap of spun silk. Worsted gloves are of many kinds. Lambs' wool and Shetland are extremely soft and warm. Dutch knit, plain and lined, are strong and warm. German icorstcd are the cheapest. Worsted gloves, though not so elegant as others, have a great advantage in their real warmth in cold weather. The above gloves of silk, cotton, worsted, and thread are now generally woven in the loom, knit gloves, formerly so common, being seldom met with.

Rub this over the outside of the gloves, and let them dry gradually in the shade ; or, if in the house, not too near the fire. When about half dry rub them well, and stretch them on the hand or wooden mould; after they are rubbed and dried brush them with a soft brush to get out the dust. Finally, iron the gloves with a smoothing-iron moderately heated, taking the precaution to place a cloth or piece of paper over them, and they will look like new. Tanned gloves, commonly called Limerick, are economical in spring and autumn, as they do not soil so soon as white.

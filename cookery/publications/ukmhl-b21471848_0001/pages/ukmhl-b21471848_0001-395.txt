CREAM OF 'TARTAR is now called by chemists hitartrate of potash, being a compound of tartaric acid and potash. It is a concrete saline matter, which separates from wines after they have undergone complete fermentation. It adheres to the top and sides of the casks in red or whitish grey crystals, according to the colour of the liquor. In this state it is called crude tartar, having a sub-acid taste, and being with difficulty soluble in water. By repeated solution, filtration, and crystallisa- tion, crude tartar may be purified, when it is called crystals of tartar, and, if these be reduced to powder, cream of tartar. This salt is a mild, cooling, and aperient medicine. If half or a whole ounce of it be taken in substance with treacle or any other vehicle it proves an effectual purgative. Farther, when dissolved in water it aff'ords, with the addition of sugar, an agreeable acidulated drink, which is of great service in ardent fevers, and likewise forms a pleasant beverage during the summer.

Creosote may be obtained in a separate form by distilling tar, and is then a volatile, colourless, very strongly smelling liquid. Mr. Cooley thus details its uses :â€” Creosote is recommended for internal use against several diseases of the channels of digestion and the organs of respiration, against rheumatism and gout, torpid nervous fever, spasms, diabetes, and tapeworm ; in the form of pills; with the juice of Spanish liquorice

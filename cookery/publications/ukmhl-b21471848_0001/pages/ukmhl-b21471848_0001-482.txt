EGG MINCE PIES. Boil six eggs until they are hard, shred them small, and shred double the quantity of suet; then add 1 lb. of currants picked and washed (if your eggs are large you must use more currants), the peel of one lemon shred very finely, and the juice, six- spoonsful of sweet wine, mace, nutmeg, sugar, a very small quantity of salt, orange, lemon, and citron candied.

Three eggs to a quart of meal (no wheat flour, and to be made also with milk, as water would make it heavy), and a spoonful of butter, all well beaten together, and made up of a consistence tliicker than cakesâ€”too thick to pour out, but just thick enough to require to be taken up with a spoon. Tliis may be baked like cakes immediately after being mixed. It must be baked in a tin pan, which should be placed in a Dutch oven, not too hot at first, but the fire under it to be increased. The object is to have it to begin to bake at the bottom, when it will rise in the process of baking, become brown on the top, and, when put on the table and cut, resemble what we call pound cake.

When quite light knead it up as bread, and let it lighten before moulding out; grease the pans, and bake them with a moderate heat. A little sugar and water rubbed on just before baking rolls makes them glossy. EGG SANDWICHES.

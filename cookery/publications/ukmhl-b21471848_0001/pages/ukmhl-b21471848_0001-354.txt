The dollar of the United States of North America, weighing 416 grains of standard silver, is valued at 4s. 4d. English. It has on the edge ' one dollar or unit hundred cents,' and has its divisions of half and quarter. By an act of 1837 the silver dollar of the United States is required to contain 412 grains of standard silver of which one-tenth is alloy, which is now the proportion in all coins of the United States, whether of silver or gold. The Spanish dollar of the old sort, before a new coinage took place in 1772, was of the sterling value of 4s. 4|d. Till then there were dollars of two denominations, the Mexican and the Sevillan dollar. That which is at present generally circulated as the Spanish dollar is really of the sterling value of 4s. 3|d. It passes in Spain for 20 reals vellon. The rix- dollar of the north of Europe is termed Thaler by the Germans; Pezza is the Italian, and Piastre the Turkish dollar. See Rix-dollar. Doodee and Half Doodee, copper pieces of 10 Lnd 5 cash, current at Madras. They are struck in England. Dojjpia or Pistole, an Italian gold coin, of which the value varies in different states. Kelly says, among the prices current at Genoa July 20th, 1807, the Roman doppia was at 20 lire 14 soldi; Parma, ditto, 26 lire 14 soldi; Piedmont, ditto, old, 35 lire 8 soldi; ditto, new, 34 lire 15 soldi. At Milan the value of the doppia was fixed by an imperial edict in 1786 at 25 lire 3 soldi cor- renti. Its English value is about 15s. 7d. ster- ling. In the Piedmontese territory the older doppia has been long out of currency. The present is of 24 lire; the half, &c., in propor- tion. The old Piedmontese doppia of 1741 to 1785 was of the value of £1 3s. 9d. sterling; that after 1785, £1 2s. l^L The Parma doppia of 1787 was worth 17s. 7id.; that of 1796, 16s. 10|d.

English value 8s. 9d. Ducat, German, also a gold coin, the rate of coinage of which, although each state has its own ducats, is nearly the same all over Germany.

Sfd. Ducat, Russian, originally worth 2|^ rubles; the double 4^; but in 1764 their value was raised, the double ducat to 5 rubles 60 kopeks, and the single to 2 rubles 80 kopeks. Kelly rates the sterling value of the Russian ducat of 1751 at 9s. Hd.; of 1763 at 9s. 3Jd.; and that of 1796 at 9s. 5d. This also had its double and half.

EMOLLIENTS are those medicines which are supposed to soften and relax the fibres of the body, either by mechanically distending such as before were too closely, that is, preter- naturally combined, or by penetrating into the interstices of the elementary fibres, and supply- ing those particles from a deficiency of which they were too intimately united. Among the remedies of the former class are chiefly heat and all unctuous applications, such as lard, wax, fat of venison, &c.; to the latter belong all juicy, mucilaginous, and saccharine substances, serving both as nutriment and medicines. Of this de- scription are the expressed vegetable oils, fresh butter, decoctions of the marsh-mallows, intu- sions of linseed, &c. Emollients are requiredâ€” 1. When the fibres are in too rigid a state. 2. When they are spasmodically contracted. 3. In all active inflammations, and 4. In obstinate costiveness, or accumulations of feces in the intestines. EM POTAGE. Put into a large saucepan 3 lbs. or 4 lbs. of beefsteaks, a knuckle of veal, and four old hens; moisten this quantity of meat with two ladlesful of broth; set it on a stove, and let it boil till properly reduced, taking care that none of the meat burns, which would make the empotage of too high a colour; fill up your saucepan with broth, adding carrots, turnips, and onions ; let all these ingredients stand over the fire for three hours and a half; then strain the whole through a silk sieve that it may be perfectly clear.

Take pieces of different sorts of fish, such as salmon, skate, sole, &c. sweat them till tender with turnip, onion, celery, a clove of garlic, and a blade of mace ; then add some plain veal broth. Simmer the whole together for half an hour; then strain and skim it free from fat, season with salt and Cayenne pepper, clear it with white of egg, and colour it with a little saffron. It may be served to table with celery or rice in it. FISH STOCK : To Make. Take 1 lb. of skate, four or five flounders, and 2 lbs. of eels ; clean them well, cut them into pieces, cover the whole with water, and season with mace, pepper, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, two roots of parsley sliced, and some sweet herbs. Let the composition simmer an hour and a half closely covered, and then strain off for use. FISH, TAINTED: To Core. Boil the fish in plenty of water, in which put one-fourth vinegar, some salt, and some powdered charcoal tied in linen. This will remove the bad taste of meat as well as fish. FISH, TAMAPJND. Take any quantity of salmon, split it down the back, take out the bone, and score it in the way fish is crimped ; sprinkle finely powdered salt over it, and leave it three days; wash, and hang it out in the sun. Dissolve some acid tamarinds in vinegar, and strain off the liquor; cut the fish into small pieces, and wrap them round covered with the tamarinds, which must not be too liquid ; press them into a jar, tie them over with a blad- der, and leave them fifteen or twenty days in a dry place, when they will be fit for use. Wash and dry the fish well, fry it in butter, and send hot rice to table with it. It keeps a long time. FISH, TUREEN OF. Take fresh-water fish of any kind, or different sorts together. If they be dressed en gras stew them with a few slices of ham and veal, a little broth, a glass of white wine, a bundle of sweet herbs, two cloves, one of garlic, thyme, a bay leaf, a few slices of bacon, pepper, and salt. When done drain them from the liquor, and put the fish in a tureen; add a little cullis to their broth, skim it, sift it in a sieve, and serve upon the fish. You may add what sort of ragout you choose. FISTULA. Ulcers in the neighbourhood of the anus are peculiarly liable to become fistulous, and when in that state are very difficult to cure. A fistula is frequently the consequence of neglected or ill-treated piles. The presence of this complaint is discovered by the sensation of a pricking pain on going to stool, which is also perceived during the exertion of coughing or sneezing. On examination a stain of a pale colour, occasionally accompanied with a little

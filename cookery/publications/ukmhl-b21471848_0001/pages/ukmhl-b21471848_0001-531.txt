Let the whole boil half an hour, and then add the soft roes of carp parboiled; let them stew a quarter of an hour, and then put the ragout into the pies.

FISH SALAD, SAUCE FOR. Pound loz. of scraped horseradish, and add thereto i oz. of salt, a table-spoonful of made mustard, 4 drachms of shred shallots, J drachm of celery seed bruised, and the same quantity of Cayenne; put to these a pint of bumet or tarragon vinegar, and let the whole stand in a jar for a week, at the end of which time strain it off for use. FISH, SALT. Salted fish requires soaking according to the time it has been in salt. That which is hard and dry requires two nights' soaking, changing the water two or three times: in the intermediate time lay it on a stone floor. Barreled cod requires less soaking; and for the best Dogger Bank split fish, which has not been in salt more than a fortnight or three weeks, still less soaking will be necessary. FISH, SALT : To Dress. Lay the piece you mean to dress all night in water, with a glass of vinegar, and boil it enough; then break it into flakes on the dish, warm it up with cream and a large piece of butter rubbed with a little flour, and serve with egg sauce. FISH SAUCE. Take some mutton or veal gravy, and put to it a little of the liquor that drains from your fish; put it into a saucepan, with an onion, an anchovy, a spoonful of catsup, and a glass of white wine; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a spoonful of cream. If you cannot procure cream, instead of white wine you must use red. FISH SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER. Set over the fire a quarter of a pint of vinegar and half a pint of water (the water must not be hard), simmer very gently, with an onion, half a handful of horseradish, four cloves, two blades of mace, and half a tea-spoonful of black pepper. These spices should be slightly bruised. When the onion is quite tender chop it small with a couple of anchovies, and set the whole to boil for a few minutes with a spoonful of catsup. In the meantime have ready, and well beaten, the yolks of three fresh eggs; strain them, mix the liquor by degrees with them, and when they are well mixed set the saucepan over a moderate fire, holding a basin in one hand, into which toss the sauce to and fro, and shake the sauce- pan over the fire to prevent the eggs from curdling. Do not boil them, but only let the sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of meltied butter. FISH SAUCE A LA CRASTEE. Thicken

This is an excellent con- fection for the sick room, besides being a paste of very agreeable flavour. Put a quantity of ripe elderberries into a stone jar, place the jar in a pan of boiling water, and let them boil until they are sufficiently soft to be pulped through a sieve. There is very little pulp, but a great deal of juice. Put both into a pan, and boil them until they begin to thicken. When of the consistency of thick oil stir in 1 lb. of sifted sugar to every pint of reduced pulp ; stir it well, and boil the whole mass till it is reduced to a paste ; put it into pots, and keep it in the same manner as currant jelly. ELDER ROB.

Three quarts should be re- duced to one. Put it into pots, set them in the sun for two or three days, and paper them as usual.

Take care to keep the bottles closely corked. ELDER WINE (1).

ELDER-BUDS, PICKLED. The elder- buds should be gathered when they are about the size of hop-buds; put them into a strong brine of salt and water for nine days, and stir them two or three times a day ; put them into a pan, cover them with vine leaves, and pour over them the water they came out of; set them over a slow fire till they become quite green, and then make a pickle for them of alegar, a little mace, a few shallots, and some ginger sliced ; boil this two or three minutes, and pour it upon the buds ; then tie them down, and keep them in a very dry place. ELDER-FLOWER FRITTERS. They are made whilst the elder-flowers are in bloom, and they should marinate three or four hours in brandy, sugar, orange-flower water, and lemon- peel.

Precedence of Entrdes or Joints. 93 this is almost alwa5's a mistake. Many persons refuse it, and they are right, containing, as it gene- rally does, a considerable proportion of creamâ€”an injudicious beginning, when there is much variety to follow; excellent sometimes as one of three or four dishes, but dangerous otherwise to the guest who has not an exceptionally powerful digestion.

Two fish, of course, should always be served; as, for example, a slice of Severn or Christchurch salmon, just arrived from the water, for its own sake, and a fillet of Avhito fish for the sake of its sauce and garnish, which should be therefore perfect. The next dish is, in London, a question under discussion; viz., the question of precedence to an entree, or to the piece de resistance.

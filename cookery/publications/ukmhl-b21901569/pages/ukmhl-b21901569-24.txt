These animals we can consume as food, and thus procure, if we please, ready prepared for our purpose, the materials of flesh, sinew, and bone, for immediate use. We obtain also from the animal milk and the egg, already said to be "perfect " foods ; and they are so because they con- tain the nitrogenous compounds referred to, fatty matter abundantly, and the various saline or mineral matters requisite. But compounds simpler in form than the preceding, of a non-nitrogenous kind, that is, of carbon, hydi'ogen, and oxygen only, are neces- sary as food for the production of animal heat and force. These consist, first, of the fat of animals of various kinds, and of butter ; and from the vegetable kingdom, of the fatty matter which exists in grain and legumes, and largely in the olive and in many seeds: secondly, of the starchy matters, all derived * The vegetable kingdom comprelicnds the cereals, legumes, roots, starches, sugar, herbs, and fruits. Persons who style themselves vegetarians, often consume milk, eggs, butter, and lard, which are choice foods from the animal kingdom. There are other persons, of course, who arc strictly vcgetaljle eaters, and such alone have anj' right to the title of vegetarians.

Constihcents necessary in Human Food. 9 stances, provided the mixture (dish or meal) contains all the elements required in due proportion for the purposes of the body. It would be out of place to occupy much space with those elementary details of the chemical consti- tution of the body Avhich may be found in any small manual of human physiology ; * but for the right understanding of our subject, a brief sketch must be presented. Let it suffice to say that carbon, hydro- gen, and oxygen, the three all-pervading elements of the vegetable world, enter largely into the composi- tion of the animal body; and that the two former combined especially constitute a fuel, the oxidation of which produces animal heat, and developes the force in its varied forms, physical and mental, which the body is capable of exerting. Besides these, nitrogen, obtainable from certain vegetable products, not from aU, but forming definite combinations with the three elements just named, is essential to the repair and reproduction of the body itself, being one of its most important constituents. Lastly must be named several other elements which, in small proportions, are also essential constituents of the body ; such as sulphur, phosphorus, salts of lime, magnesia, potash, &c., with traces of iron and other metals. All these must be present in the food supplied, otherwise animal exist- * Such as Phijsiolorjy, Science Primer, by M.

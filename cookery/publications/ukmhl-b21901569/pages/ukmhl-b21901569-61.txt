This is to be done by placing in the braise-pot slices of ham or bacon, some cut carrots, turnips, onions, herbs, cloves, and some French wine ; but this, I would submit, is rather stewing than brais- ing. The proper way of conducting the latter mode is to make beforehand a strong decoction by boiling together all these materials, adding stock, and wino serving in part to flavour if desired, and in part to preserve the liquor, and reducing the whole, making in fact what is called a mire-poix. A small quantity of this is then to serve as the fluid in which the portion of meat or bird, &c., is to be braised. The third principle is not generally considered ab- solutely essential to the process; although it is un- doubtedly the last refinement necessary to produce a first-rate braise. It is that of partially browning or half-roasting the portion also ; and this may be ac- complished in two ways. The legitimate or original way of doing this, is, to have well fitted to the braise- pot a sunk copper or iron cover, in which some hot coals or charcoal are placed, in order to transmit downwards a scorching heat to the top of the portion which is uncovered by the liquid in the pot below. In this case it is usual to cover the portion, especi- ally if a fowl, with a piece of white paper, which serves to shield a delicate morsel from a too fierce heat. The other and inferior way is to very lightly roast the fowl, or what not, before putting it into

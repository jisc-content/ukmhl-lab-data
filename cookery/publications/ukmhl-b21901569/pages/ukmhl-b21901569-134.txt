Food and Feeding. I20 On looking tlirougli the foregoing menuB, it may be observed tbat tbe most substantial dish has been placed next after tbe fisb, and tbat it is followed by tbe entrie, after wbicb comes tbe " roast," wbicb in its turn is followed by tbe choice vegetable served apart. Those who prefer tbe entree before the substantial dish, can so arrange it; but whenever the latter happens to be roasted, as may sometimes be the case, it interferes most undesirably, by juxtaposition with the " roast" proper. This error may then be to some extent corrected by placing the choice vegetable be- tween the two, i.e. before the roast proper instead of after it; and this course should be taken whenever the first-named change is made. In all cases too, there should be a marked difference in the material and culinary treatment of any two con- secutive dishes; thus it is obviously undesirable that one white (or brown) preparation should follow another; a quenelle of veal, for example, after a boiled sole; or that a salmi of game should precede a roast puUet. It may be observed that white and brown meats and sauces mostly alternate, that grills and braises contrast; tbat a delicate white entree successfully introduces the roast, that when the latter is substantial, as a haunch of venison, or a saddle of mutton, the preceding entree may be less important; and so on. As a rule, to which there are a few exceptions, the procession of dishes after the fish is from the substantial to the more delicate, then to the contrasts between more piquant flavour and sweetness.

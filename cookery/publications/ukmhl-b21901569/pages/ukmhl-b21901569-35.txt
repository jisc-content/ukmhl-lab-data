Little Niti'ogenous matter needed in Tropics. 21 exercise of their powers, and—small compliment to their \nves and sisters—fit only for the occupation of women. Admitting man, then, to be physically so constituted as to be able to derive all that is necessary to the healthy performance of all his functions from the animal or from the vegetable kingdom, either singly or combined, he can scarcely be regarded otherwise than as qualified to be an omnivorous animal. Add to this fact his possession of an intelligence which enables him to obtain food of all kinds and climes, to investigate its qualities, and to render it more fit for digestion by heat—powers which no other animal possesses—and there appears no a priori reason for limiting his diet to products of either kingdom exclu- sively. It becomes then a matter of no little interest to ascertain what materials, under the empirical condi- tions named, have furnished the stajjle food of the common people of various climates and races—what, in short, supports the life and labour of the chief part of the world's population. In the tropics and adjacent portions of the temperate zones, high temperature being incompatible with the physical activity familiar to northern races, a very little nitrogenous material suffices, since the waste of muscle is small. Only a moderate quantity of fat is taken, the demand for heat-production being incon- siderable. The chiefly starchy products supply nearly all the nutriment required, and such are found in rice,

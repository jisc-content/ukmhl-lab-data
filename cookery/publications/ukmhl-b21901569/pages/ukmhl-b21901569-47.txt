Hozv to cook Haricots. may be treated tLus: Soak, say, a quart of tlio dried haricots in cold water for about twelve hours, after which place them in a saucepan, with two quarts of cold water and a little salt, on the fire; when boiling remove to the corner and simmer slowly until the beans are tender; the time required being about tv,'0 to three hours.* This quantity will fill a large dish, and may be eaten with salt and pepper. It will be greatly improved at small cost by the addition of a bit of butter, or of melted butter with parsley, or if an onion or two have been sliced and stewed with the haricots. A better dish still may be made by putting all or part, after boiling, into a shallow frying-pan, and lightly frying for a few minutes with a little lard and some sliced onions. With a few slices of bacon added, a comparatively luxurious and highly nutritive meal may be made. But there is still in the sauce- pan, after boiling, a residue of value, which the French peasant's wife, who turns everything to account, utilises in a manner quite incomprehensible to the Englishwoman. The water in which dried haricots have stewed, and also that in which green French beans have been boiled, contains a proportion of nutritive matter. The Frenchwoman always pre- serves this liquor carefully, cuts and fries some onions, adds to it these and some thick slices of bread, a little salt and pepper with a potherb or two from the corner which is a very palatable one, is known as haricots verts panacMs (variegated), and might be served at our tables with advantage. * If the water is hard, a little soda may be added with advantage, n

Boiled Water safe and pure. 105 influences whicli pervade certain districts of soutlicrn Europe. The only water safe for the traveller to drink is a natural mineral water, and such is now always procurable throughout Europe, except in very remote or unfrequented places.* In the latter circum- stances no admixture of wine or spirit counteracts the poison in tainted water, and makes it safe to drink, as people often delight to believe ; but the simple process of boiling it renders it perfectly harmless ; and this result is readily attained in any locality by making weak tea to be taken hot or cold ; or in making toast- water, barley-water, lemonade, &c. The table waters now so largely imported into this country from Germany and France, contain a considerable propor- tion of mineral matter in solution, and while they are wholesome as regards freedom from organic impu- rities, are, of course, less perfect for daily use than absolutely pure waters, such as tkose above referred to.

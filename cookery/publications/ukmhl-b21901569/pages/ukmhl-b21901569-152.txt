Yet care must be taken not to alter the flavour; therefore if any colouring matter is used, it should be caramel, while fried onion, fried carrot, and similar substances should be avoided for the reason given."* The same principle is laid down by Brillat-Savarin. "By a 'pot-au-feu we understand a portion of beef destined to be treated in boiling water lightly salted, so as to extract the soluble parts. "The hoiiillon is the liquid which remains when the process is completed. "The houiUi is the flesh deprived of its soluble parts. " The water dissolves, first, a part of the osmazome; then the albumen, which coagulates by heat, some of it forming the scum which is removed; then more osmazome and extractive matter or gravy; finally, some portions of the sheath of the muscular fibres, which are detached in boiling. " To make good bouillon, the water must boil very gently, &c. Some vegetables are to be added to heighten the flavour; and bread or pastes to render it more nourishing; and then it becomes a soup." f By way of presenting a somewhat difi'ereut view of the pot-au-feu, I subjoin the receipt of Alexandre Dumas, from the Bictionuairc cle Cuisine, his last work, and a posthumous publication.

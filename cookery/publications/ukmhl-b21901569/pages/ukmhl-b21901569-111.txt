A perfect Dinner, 97 sight and sound. A perfect comommi, a choice of two fish, a filet or a Chateaubriand, a gigot or a fricandeau: followed by a chaudfroid, a creme cle volaille garni, a roast and salad, a choice vegetable, and an iced souffle or charlotte; and in summer a macecloine of fresh fruits in an old china family bowl, if there is one ; and lastly, a savoury biscuit; accom- panying vegetables and appropriate wines ;—may be regarded as furnishing a scheme for such a party— or a theme of which the variations are endless.* Seven or eight guests can thus be brought into close contact: with a larger number the party is apt to form two coteries, one on each side of the host. The number is a good one also in relation to the commis- sariat department—eight persons being well supplied by an entree in one dish ; while two dishes are neces- sary for ten or twelve persons. Moreover, one bottle of wine divides well in eight; if, therefore, the host desire to give with the roast one glass of particularly fine ripe Gorton or Pomard, a single bottle is equal to the supply; and so with any other choice specimen of which a single circulation is required; and of course the rule holds equally if the circuit is to be repeated. And this leads us to the question—and an important one it is—of the "Wine. * For an illustration of this, see a scries of mmms at the end of Chapter IX.

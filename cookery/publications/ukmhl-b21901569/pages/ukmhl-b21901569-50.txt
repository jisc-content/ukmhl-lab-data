Food and Feeding. 36 more easily digested than meat is; and, consuming â– weight for weight, the eater feels lighter and less oppressed, as a rule, after the leguminous dish; Avhile the comparative cost is very greatly in favour of the latter. I do not of course overlook in the dish of simple haricots the absence of savoury odours proper to well-cooked meat; but nothing is easier than to combine one part of meat with two parts of haricots, adding vegetables and garden herbs, so as to produce a stew which shall be more nutritious, wholesome, and palatable than a stew of all meat with vegetables, and no haricots. Moreover, the cost of the latter will be more than double that of the former. I have just adverted to the bread of the labom-er, and recommended that it should be made from entire wheat meal; but it should not be so coarsely ground as that commonly sold in London as " whole meal." The coarseness of "whole meal" is a condition de- signed to exert a specific effect on the digestion for those who need it, and, useful as it is in its place, is not desirable for the average population referred to. It is worth observing, in relation to this coarse meal, that it will not produce light agreeable bread when made in the form of ordinary loaves : a solid mass of this meal being a very bad conductor of heat, will have a hard flinty crust if baked sufficiently to cook the interior; or it will have a soft dough-like interior, if the baking is checked when the crust is properly done. Consequently the form of a flat cake, re- sembling that of the ordinary tea-cake, is preferable,

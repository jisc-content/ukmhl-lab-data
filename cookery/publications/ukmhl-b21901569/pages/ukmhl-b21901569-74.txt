Food and Feeding. 6o principles of cookeiy whicli are involved in the process. By way of further illustrating the subject, I shall place there also some extracts relating to it, which are extremely interesting, from Brillat-Savarm's Fhysiologie du Gout, and also from Dumas' Grand Dictionmire de Cuisine. It is not at all surprising that many persons should be somewhat bewildered by the almost endless variety of appellation under which the single article of soup is presented at table. It has been estimated that the titles which denote these numerous varieties, number altogether not less perhaps than five hundred. And proceeding on the principle on which these are pro- duced, there appears to be no reason why even the present list should not be doubled in length. In reality the number of species is very limited; but the slightest addition to a soup having been held sufficient to confer upon it a distinctive name, the idea of com- plexity and number has been unnecessarily fostered. Regarded analytically, there are but five leading species from which all varieties are produced by slight additions and combinations of flavour. 1.

The Fare of the Agriculhiral Labotirer. 31 value of fisli as a staple article of diet for those who lead a sedentary life, including consequently many whose pursuits are chiefly literary, is undoubted, and arises from the causes just pointed out. Having enunciated some general principles, which it is important should first be established, I shall offer briefly an illustration or two of the manner in which they may be applied. This brings us to the second division of the subject, viz., the practical treat- ment of certain aliments, in order to render them suitable for food. Dealing first with that of the agricultural labourer, our object is to economise his small pittance ; to give him, if possible, a rather more nutritive, wholesome, and agreeable dish—he can have but one—than his means have hitherto fur- nished. But here there is little scope for change; already said to live chiefly on bread and cheese, with occasionally bacon, two indications only for improve- ment can be followed, viz., augmentation of nitro- genous matter to meet the wear and tear of the body in daily hard labour, and of fatty matter to furnish heat and force. A fair proportion of meat, one of the best means of fulfiUing them, is not within his reach. First, his daily bread ought to contain all the con- stituents of the wheat, instead of being made of flour from which most of the mineral elements have been removed. But beans and peas are richer in nitrogen than wheat, and equal it in starch, mineral matters, and fat, the last being in very small quantity, while maize has three times their proportion of fat.

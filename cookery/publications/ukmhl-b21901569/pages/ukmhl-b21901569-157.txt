Beef ct la Mode. 143 " Observations on Beef d la Mode. Beef d la mode is so useful and so justly appre- ciated iu domestic cookery, that I tliink it will be appreciated if I recapitulate tlie principal details of the process, so tliat there may be no error in carr^dntr it out. ^ ^ "The important question, after the choice of the meat, is the cooking, which must be done entirely by slow simmering; and this is one of the most essential pomts for success. For Avhcn exposed to a hot fire the result is a white, watery, insipid gravy, such as is too often found in kitchens where cooking is carelessly done. The gravy ought to be red iu colour, rather gelatinous in consistence, and full of the agreeable flavour and nutritive matter of both meat and vege- tables, which is the distinctive mark of the dish. To obtain this excellent quality, the vegetables should be put into the braising pot at the proper time, so that all are cooked together. "1 advise, in regard of all braised meats, whether beef or veal, that the portions should be rather too large than too small; a long process of cooking suc- ceeds always better with such, than with tiny portions. A second excellent dish can always be made cold ^vith the addition of jelly. It appears to me better then to eat twice following of a good dish thus varied, than to cook the small quantity which suffices only for one meal." * * " U Livre de Cuisine. J. aoulTd.

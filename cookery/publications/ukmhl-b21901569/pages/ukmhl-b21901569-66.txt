Food and Feedhig. 52 greasy, and therefore for many persons indigestible, the shallow form of the pan being unsuited for the process of boiling in oil, that is, at a heat of nearly 500° Fahr., that of boiling water being 212°. This high temperature produces results, which are equiva- lent indeed to quick roasting, when the article to be cooked is immersed in the boiling fat. Frying, as generally conducted, is rather a combination of broil- ing, toasting or scorchiag; and the use of the^ deep pan of boiling oil or dripping, which is essential to the right performance of the process, and especially preventing greasiness, is a rare exception and not the rule in ordinary kitchens. The principle on which success depends is, that at the moment of contact with the hot oil, a thin film of every part of the surface of the fish or other object to be fried is coagulated, so that the juices with their flavours, &c., are at once locked up within; and no quality can escape. The bath of oil should therefore be in quantity sufi&cient, and also be hot enough, to effect this result in an instant, after which, and during the few minutes requisite to cook the interior, the heat is often sHghtly lowered with advantage. The fish emerges when done, with a surface to which a little oil adheres, but this will drain off owing to its extreme fluidity when hot, if left a minute or two before the fire; it may thus be served absolutely free from grease. The film of egg often applied to the surface of an object to be fried, is instantly coagulated and forms an imperme- able case; while the fine bread crumbs adhering to it

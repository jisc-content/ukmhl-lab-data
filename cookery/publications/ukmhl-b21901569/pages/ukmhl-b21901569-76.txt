62 Food and Feeding. made by means of a little skill in combination, are literally endless. A short list of exceptional soups, each with a distinct individual character, may still be referred to as not belonging to the above-mentioned classes. Such as turtle; perhaps mock turtle or calf's head; ox-tail, muUigataAvny; giblet and " cock-a-leelde," are almost stews ; the latter doubtless designed originally to present the patriarch of the poultry yard in an eatable form. Bouillahaise is almost a fish stew, although ranked conventionally among the soups. Then there is an important distinction, recognised chiefly on the Continent, and related to the demands of religious observance, between soups which have meat for their basis {potage gras), and those which have fish, or exclusively vegetable bases [potage maigve); into the latter. class also, eggs are admitted. All these take rank of course among the five classes first named; but they are referred to separately here in order to draw attention to a fact not generally recognised in this country, that excellent soups may be made without employing meat. Vegetable soups, clear and thick, are extremely palatable ; the former being agreeable and Avholesome, especially in the warm season when fresh vegetable growth is abundant, and full of juice and fragrance; and the latter or thick soup, may be very nutritious also, as already shown, since they contain a consider- able quantity of barley, peas, beans, haricots, Indian corn, rice, &c.

The Grand Boidllon. The Consomme. 59 so with many other articles ; for example, a small and well cleaned ham may be cooked — and this is an affair of several hours—in a capacious stock-pot, with advantage equally to the soup and the ham, provided, of course, that the ham has already been soaked some twenty-four hours or so beforehand to remove super- fluous salt; nor should any salt be put into the stock- pot when required for this operation.

Lastly, there is the consomme, which is a decoction of beef, veal, and fowl, the two latter partially roasted for the purpose of heightening flavour; and it is made, not with Avater, but with houiUon—Gouffe orders the (jrand houillon just de- scribed—and with a few more vegetables. This is therefore the highest form of soup from beef, veal, poultry and vegetables which can be produced. Now, as the mode of making ]jot-au-fm is an im- portant initial step in the art of soup-making, I shall place in an appendix at the end of this volume, a somewhat abridged translation of the very complete instructions given by Gouffe. The right management is with him a matter of the highest importance; and, simple as the dish is, he devotes no less than nine pages to the task of illustrating the elementary

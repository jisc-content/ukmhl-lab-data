What I attach most importance to is, to enable even a person who approaches a range for the first time in his life, to make quite sure of suc- ceeding, if my instructions arc followed precisel3^ " The Pot. "Four different kinds of pot are employed in do- mestic cookery :â€”' 1. A cast-iron pot. 2. An earthenware pot. 3. A tinned iron pot. 4. A copper pot. " I object strongly to the first two kinds ; to a cast- iron pot because it is very difficult, if not impossible, to remove the grease, which, after a certain time, becomes engrained in the pores of the cast-iron. I object equally to the earthenware pot which enjoys a reputa- tion among certain housewives so little warranted. So far from improving the broth, it spoils it in every way. When new it preserves for a long time a taste of earth and varnish, of which hot water can never altogether deprive it; when old, it acquires a taste of rancid fat which no amount of washing can destroy. On the other hand I specially recommend pots, of tinned iron or copper, as they are easily washed, and as it is quite impossible to make a good broth unless the vessel is absolutely clean.

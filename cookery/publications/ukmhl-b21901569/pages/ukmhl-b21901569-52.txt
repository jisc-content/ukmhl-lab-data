Whole meal may be bought; but mills are now cheaj)ly made for home use, and wheat may be ground to any degree of coarseness desired. •Further examples are unnecessary here, although it would be an easy task to fill a volume with matter of this kind, illustrating the ample means which exist for diminishing somewhat the present wasteful use of "butchers' meats'' with positive advantage to the consumer. Many facts in support of this position will appear as we proceed. But another important object in furnishing the foregoing details is to point out how combinations of the nitrogenous, starchy, fatty, and mineral elements may be made, in well-proportioned mixtures, so as to produce what I have termed a " perfect" dish—perfect, that is, so far as the chief in- dication is concerned, viz., one which supplies every de- mand of the body, without containing any one element in undue proportion. For it is obvious that one or two of these elements may exist in injurious excess, especially for delicate stomachs, the varied peculiarities of which, as before insisted on, must sometimes render necessary a modification of all rules. Thus it is easy to make the fatty constituent too large, and thereby derange digestion, a result frequently experienced by persons of sedentary habits, to whom a little pastry, a morsel of foie gras, or a rich cream is a source of great discomfort, or of a "bilious attack;" while the labourer, who requires much fatty fuel for his M'Ork, would have no difficulty in consuming a large quantity

Place the piece of meat in a stew-pan with rather less than a pint of white wine, a wine-glass of brandy, a pint of stock, a pint of water: two calves' feet already boned and blanched, and the rind of the bacon also blanched. Put it on the fire, adding a little less than 1 oz. of salt (30 grammes). Make it boil, and skim it as for a pot-an-feu; next, having skimmed it, add fully 1 lb. (500 grammes) of carrots, one onion, three cloves, one faggot of herbs, and two pinches of pepper. Place the stew-pan on the corner of the stove, cover it, and allow it to simmer very gently for four hours and-a-half. Try the meat with a skewer to ascertain Avhen it is sufficiently cooked; then put it on a dish with the carrots and the calves' feet, and keep them covered i;p hot until serving. Kext, strain the gravy through a fine tammy; remove carefully every atom of grease, and reduce it over the fire about a quarter. Lastly, untie the beef, place it on the dish for serâ„¢ig; add the calves' feet, each having been cut in eight pieces, the carrots cut into pieces the size of a cork, and ten glazed onions. Arrange the calves' feet, carrots and onions round the beef; pour the sauce over the meat, keeping the surplus for the next day. Taste it, in order to ascertain if sufficiently seasoned.

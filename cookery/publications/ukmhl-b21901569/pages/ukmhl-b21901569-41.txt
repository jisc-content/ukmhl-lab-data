Thus man is clearly omnivorous ; while men may be advantageously vege- tarian in one climate, mixed eaters in another, and exclusively flesli-eaters in a third. I have not hesitated to say that Englishmen gene- rally have adopted a diet adapted for a somewhat more northerly latitude than that which they occupy; that the cost of their food is therefore greater than it need be, and that their numerous forms of indigestion and much resulting chronic disease are further necessary consequences of the same error. They consume too much animal food, particularly the flesh of cattle. For all who are occupied with severe and continuous mechanical labour, a mixed diet, of which cereals and legumes form a large portion, and meat, fish, eggs, and milk form a moderate, but constant proportion, is more nutritious and wholesome than almost entirely animal food.

Then there is a large class of per- sons who indulge, not necessarily in quantity, but in a kind of food generally reputed "simple and AA^hole- somc," which nevertheless for them creates a con- dition of corpulence, not merely inconvenient, but

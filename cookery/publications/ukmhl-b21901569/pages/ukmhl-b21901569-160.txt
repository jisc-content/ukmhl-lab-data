Food and Feeding. T46 Clarify the consomme of fish with the whites of egg and fillets of whiting. The vegetables must be sufficiently fried to give the consomme a light tint. Op. cif. p. 348. To present the above as a soup, make a number of small quenelles of whiting, and add to the tureen before serving. The next, a simpler receipt, can be recommended, after numerous trials, as an excellent family fish-soup. Keferred to at p. 63. Put 3 oz. of butter into a stewpan; add two carrots sliced; one onion and a shalot, in thin slices; a clove, a little thyme, and some parsley. Fry them gently until of a reddish tint; then add 3 pints of cold water. Let it boil, skimming occasionally. Then add a small fresh haddock, bones and all, cut up into pieces, and the head and bones of two whitings, setting aside the fillets. Add some salt and a little pepper. Let all simmer together for 2 hours gently, at the corner of the fire; take out the bones and pass all the rest through a coarse strainer. Divide the fillets of whiting into 2 or 3 small portions each, boil for a few minutes in some of the stock, and serve all to2;ether in a tureen. It is imnecessary to clarify this soup; if other garnish is desired, quenelles of whiting may be sub- stituted for the fillets ; and some of them may have a little coral (spawn of the lobster) added to furnish colour. A further change may bo made by adding fillets of other fish, or a few shell fish.

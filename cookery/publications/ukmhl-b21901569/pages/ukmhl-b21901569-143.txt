The saddle, the haunch, the sirloin, and the round, so admirable on occasions, are only in danger of suffering here, like intimate friends, from too great familiarity with their charms. But even our standard of quality in meat has been gradually lowered, from the closer struggle, year by year, to produce a fat animal in a shorter space of time than formerly; a result which is accomplished by commencing to feed almost ex- clusively on oil-cake at a very early period of life. The result of this process is, that size and weight are attained by a deposit of fat, rather than by the construction of muscular fibre, which alone is true meat; while as a necessary consequence the cha- racteristic flavour and qualities of fully developed beef and mutton are greatly wanting in modern meat. Much more unsatisfactory is the supply of vegetable and dairy produce to our great city, particularly of the former.

io6 Food and Feeding. rior to others, the hest appearing now to be chiefly retained for Paris—are perhaps among the most satis- factory within our reach. A dash of lemon-juice, and a thin cutting of the peel, form sometimes au agreeable addition ; and nothing keeps the palate cleaner or in better order for appreciating food. I am compelled to say that the sweet compounds and fruity juices which haye of late been produced as dinner drinks, and apparently in competition with wine, are rarely wholesome adjuncts to a dinner. Such liquids rapidly develope indigestible acid pro- ducts in the stomachs of many persons; while for all, the sipping of sweet fluids during a meal tends to diminish appetite, as well as the faculty of appreci- ating good cookery. If wine is refused, let the drink which accompanies dinner, be of pure water —with a sparkle of gas in it, or a slight acid in it if you mil—but in obedience both to gastronomic and dietetic laws let it be free from sugar. No doubt there are exceptional circumstances in which fruity juices, if not very sweet, can be taken freely. Thus I have rarely quafi'ed more delicious liquor at dinner in the warm autumn of southern Europe, notably in Spain, than that afforded by ample slices of a water-melon, which fill the mouth with cool fragrant liquid; so slight is the amount of solid matter, that it only just serves to contain the abundant delicate juices of the fruit grown in those climates. Here the sac- charine matter is present only in smaU proportion.

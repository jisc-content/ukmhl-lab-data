66 Food and Feeding. And licrc, again, tlie distinctive piinciples, already referred to, of French, and Englisli cuisine, are illus- trated in relation to tlie cooking of vegetables; and again, let me add, not to tlie disadvantage of our own system. I find it the more necessary to call atten- tion to this subject, as much has of late been said, â– o hich may lead many to believe that Frencb usage is invariably right, and English usage invariably wrong. "Very far from the truth, I humbly submit, is such an allegation as this, even in regard of our treatment of vegetables. No doubt we are too often guilty of carelessness and inattention to the condition in which, vegetables are presented, in the practice of our tables, but our principle is in the main correct, and only wants to be pursued witb intelligence. Wben vegetables are really good, well grown, and fresh, no good judge desires that their natural, qualities of flavour, odour, and consistence, or even colour, sbould be destroyed by the addition of other materials, and of foreign flavours. Let us take two, in illusti'ation of these remarks, the pea, and the tomato. Garden -peas,petiis pois, when young, quickly grown, soft and succuleut by the longer boiling wbicli tbis plan permits. Instead of the orthodox twenty minutes allotted to average asparagus lying horizontally, in the English manner, which half cooks the stalk, and overcooks the head, diminishing its flavour and consistence, a period of thirty or forty minutes, on the plan recommended, will render fully a third more of the stalk delicious, while the head will be properly cooked by the steam alone. One reason why it is not uncommon to hear the best produce of the fields of Argenteuil in- sufficiently appreciated here, and our owti asparagus i^referred, is, that the former is rurely sufficiently cooked at English tables.

CHAPTER II. Materials at man's command for food—Grain—Legumes—Tubers —Green vegetables—Fruits—Salt—Animal food—Flesh—Milk —Eggs—Fisli—Eeptiles—Man omnivorous ; liis food largely determined by circumstances—Food of the tropics-North Africa—Arabia—Italy—Spain—France—German Empire and Enssia—The Arctic zone. It will be interesting now to take a general but brief survey of the vast range of materials wliich civilised man lias at liis command for tbe pui-pose of food : these few preliminary remarks on the chemical constituents of food having been intended to aid in appreciating the value of different kinds. Commencing with the vegetable kingdom, from which our early progenitors, probably during long ages, diw all their sustenance, the cereals, or culti- vated grasses, come first, as containing all the ele- ments necessary to life, and being therefore the most largely consumed. Wheat and its congeners, which rank highest in quality, had been distinguished, in the form of bread, as "the staff of life," long before the physiological demonstration of the fact had been attained. Wheat, oats, rye and barley, maize and rice, are the chief members of this group ; wheat contain- ing most of the nitrogenous or flesh-forming material,

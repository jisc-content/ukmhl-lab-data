Grains—Legumes—Tubers and Roots. 15 besides abundance of starch, a moderate amount of fat, together with sufficient saline and mineral elements. Rice, on the other hand, contains very little nitrogen, fat, and mineral constituents, but starch in great abundance ; while maize, with a fair supply of nitro- genous and starchy matter, contains the most fat or heat-producing material of the whole group. As derived from wheat must be named those valuable aliments, macaroni, vermicelli and all the Italian pastes. Derived from barley is malt - saccharine, parent of the large family of fermented liquors known as beer. And from various other grains are obtained, by fermentation and distillation, several forms of ardent spirit. Vinegar, best when produced from the grape, is also largely made from grain. The legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas, form an aHment of great value, containing more nitrogen even than the cereals, but with fat in very small pro- portion, while starchy matter and the mineral elements abound in both groups. The tuber finds its type in the potato which, like rice, contains much starch, little nitrogen, and almost no fat; in the yam also. The roots may be illustrated by the beet, carrot, parsnip, and turnip, all containing little nitrogen, but much sugar, and water in large proportion. Derived from roots and stems of foreign growth, wo have arrowroot, tapioca, and sago, all starches and destitute of nitrogen. Fatty matter is abundantiy found in the olive, which supplies a large part of the world with an important article of food.

602 APPENDIX. The marmalade would be still more transparent if you were to peel the apricots first, but then you Avould lose some of then' delicious flavour. No. 1393. Cherry Marmalade. Procure a sieve of bright Kentish cherries, pull out the stallcs and stones, and put the fruit in a preserving-pan, place over the fire, keeping it stirred until reduced to two thirds, have in another preserving-pan, to every pound of fruit, half a pound of sugar boiled to the sixth degree ^No. 1379), into which pour the fruit when boihng hot, let reduce, keep stirring until you can just see the bottom of the pan, when take it from the fire, and fiU your jars as before. A plainer way is to take off the stalks and stone the fruit, place them in a pan over a sharp fire, and to every pound of fruit add nearly half a pound of sugar, keep stir- ring until reduced as above, and let it get partly cold in the pan before fiUing the jars. No. 1394. Strawberry Marmalade. Pick twelve pounds of very red ripe strawberries, which put into a preserving-pan with ten pounds of sugar (broken into smallish pieces), place over a sharp fire, keep con- tinually stuTing, boihng it until the surface is covered mth clearish bubbles, try a little upon a cover, if it sets, fill the jars as before. No. 1395. Basj)berry Marmalade. Pick twelve pounds of raspberries and pass them through a fine sieve to extract the seeds, boil as many pounds of sugar as you had pounds of fruit to the sixth degree (No. 1379), when add the pulp of the fruit, keep stn-rmg over the fire, reducing it untH you can just see the bottom of the pan, take it from the fii'e, and put it into jars as before.

Cut two onions into very small dice and put them into a stewpan with two ounces of butter, fry them a short time, but not to change colour; have three or four handfuls of well washed sorrel, cut it into ribands, and put it into the stewpan with the onions, add two table- spoonfuls of flour, mix well, then a pint of milk and a pint of water, boil all together ten minutes, season with a little sugar and salt, and finish with a liaison of two yolks of eggs, mixed with a gill of cream, stir it in quickly, do not let it boil afterwards ; put the crust of a French roll cut in strips into your tureen, pour the soup over, and serve.

In my kitchen at home I should never think of cook- ing too large a turbot, but choose a middle-sized one which, generally speak- ing, is the best; cut an incision in the back, rub it well with a good handful of salt, then with the juice of a lemon, set it in a turbot kettle well covered with cold water, in which you have put a good handful of salt, place over the fire and as soon as the water boils put it at the side, if a turbot of ten pounds it wiU take an hour after it has boiled, if it should be allowed to more than simmer it will be very unsightly; take out of the water, leave a minute upon your drainer, serve upon a napkin garnished with fresh parsley, and lobster sauce in a boat; for sauce (see No. 68,) or shrimp sauce (No. 73).

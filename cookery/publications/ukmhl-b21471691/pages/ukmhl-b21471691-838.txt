Soyer and Lord M. H. The maitre de cmsine appears to us un- questionably to be one of the most important functionaries belonging to an embassy. Peace or vvar, winch it is scarcely necessary to interpret as the happiness or the misery of two great countries, may depend upon a headache. Now, if it were possible, in any case, to tiace the bilious uneasiness which may have perverted pacific intentions into hostile designs to Uie unsitilful or careless performance of his momentous duties by the cook-legate; no punishment could too cruelly expiate such a blunder. W^e should be inclined to ^propose tdat the brother artist who most adroitly put the delinquent to torture, should be his suc- cessor, holding office under a similar tenure. It may be matter of controversy, however, at once whether such a system would work well, and whether it is agreeable to the pre- valence of those kindly feelings which it is the object of M. Soyer, and every other good cook or wise statesman, to promulgate throughout the human family. Tlie publication of 1 tie Gastronomic Regenerator' inspires us with better hopes. The tyro of the dripping-pan will be no more entitled to screen himself behind his imperfect science or neglected education, than the unlettered criminal to plead his ignorance of the alphabet as a justification of his ignorance of the statute law whose enactments send him to Botany Bay. The rudiments and the mysteries—the elementary axioms and most recondite problems—of his lofty voca- tion are unrolled before him in legible and intelligible characters. The skill which is the oflspring of practice, must be attained by his opportunities and his industry. And if " Fame is the spur which the clear spirit doth raise," it might, we trust, satiate the most ravenous appetite which ever gnawed the bowels even of a cook, not merely to secure the tranquillity of the universe, but to save his native land the expense of armies and fleets, and turn the currents of gold, absorbed by taxation, into the more congenial channel of gastronomical enterprise. The majestic and far-spreading oak springs out of the humble acorn. In future ages the acute historian will demonstrate how tlie " copious dinner" which cemented the bonds of eternal alliance between vast and consolidated empires, whose people were clothed in purple and fine linen, lived in habita- tions decorated with every tasteful and gorgeous variety which caprice could suggest and affluence procure, and mingled the physical indolence of Sybaris with the intellectual activity of Athens, was but the ripe fruit legitimately matured from the simple bud of the calumet of peace, which sealed a hollow truce among the roving and puny bands of the naked, cityless, and untutored Indian. So, once more, the perfectibility of cookery indi- cates the perfectibility of society. The gallantry of Soyer is as conspicuous as his historical and political.philosophy. He would not profusely " scatter plenty o'er a smiling land" solely for the gratification of his own sex. The sun shines on woman as on man ; and when the sun will not shine, a woman's eye supplies all the light we need. The sagacious Regenerator refuses to restrict to the lordly moiety of mankind a monopoly of his beams, feeling that, when the pressure of mortal necessity sinks his head, fairer hands than those of the statesnimi or the warrior, the ecclesiastic or the lawyer, are likely to be the conservators of his reputation. " Allow me,'' he remarks, " to suggest to your lordship, that a meeting for practical gastronomical purposes, where there are no ladies, is in my eyes a garden without flowers, a sea without waves, an experimental squadron without sails." " Without the smile from partial beauty won. Say what were man ?—a world without a sun I" The harrowing picture of desolation, from the pen of M. Soyer, may be equalled, but cannot be surpassed, by a line here and there in Byron's ' Darkness.' The sentiment, at the same time, sounds oddly, as it issues from the penetralia of a multitudinous club. Our notion has hitherto been, that a club was an invention of which a principal object was to prove that female society was far from being indispensable to man, and that all the joys of domesticity might be tasted in a state of single-blessedness beyond the precincts of home for a small annual payment. A thorough .going club-man would very soon drive a coach and four through the Regenerator's polite eloquence. For instance, a garden without flowers has so much the more room for the growth of celery, asparagus, articliokes, and the like. There could not possibly be a greater convenience than the evaporation or disap- pe<irance of the waters of the ocean ; because we should then have railways everywhere, and no nausea. Sails, likewise, are not requisite now-a-days lor slii|is ; on the contniry, steam-vessels are so evidently superior, that the sail-muker may as well shut up his shop. The flowers of a garden are an incumbrance—the waves of the sea are an impediment—the sails of a ship are a superfluity. Garden, seo, and ship would be better wanting flowers.

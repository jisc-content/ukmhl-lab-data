No. 1397. Quince Jelly. Proceed exactly as du'ected in the last, but using quinces instead of apples. No. 1398. Currant and Raspberry Jelly. Put half a sieve of fine red currants in a large stewpan with a gallon of white cm-rants and a gallon of raspberries, add a quart of water, place over the fire, keep stming, to prevent them sticking to the bottom, and let boil about ten minutes, pour them into a sieve to drain, catching the juice in a basin and draining the currants quite dry, pass the juice whilst hot through a clean jelly-bag, have a pound of sugar to every pint of juice, and proceed precisely as directed for apple jeUy. Should you have time to pick the cm-rants from the stalks previous to boiling, you would lose that bitter flavour, and have less difficulty in making your jelly clear.

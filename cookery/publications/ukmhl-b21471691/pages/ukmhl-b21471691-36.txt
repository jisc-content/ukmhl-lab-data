AMATEUR RECEIPTS. Bis de Veau, aux Pistaches a la Br. Boots. Take three fine sweetbreads, clean them weU with milk and water, in order to make them as white as possible; do them gradually in a stewpan with good white gravy, some onion, carrot, and celery, with a little mace; then stuff them well with pistachio nuts nicely bruised; put them " en papillote" (that is, to oil or butter a piece of paper, which you fasten round by twisting it along the edge) and give them a nice wholesome colour; they will require from twenty to twenty-five minutes to bring them to a proper state of excellence, with the good, fine, wholesome colour they may be served up, with white endive, or celery sauce aux pistaches, after the above manner. Potage froid, ou Salade a la Br. Boots. Make some very good and highly-flavoured calf's-head soup, with a good abundance of egg and forcemeat balls, and some sausage-meat introduced therein; the pieces of calf's-head should not be cut larger than an inch square. When this soup is properly prepared and ripe, pour it into several milkpans, to the depth of about two inches ; let it stand in this way to cool and stiffen, for the next day's use. Dress a nice light salad of mustard and cress, with endive and a slight sprinkle of well-cut celery ; take this salad from the bowl (in which it has been dressed), hghtly with a fork, and form in a pyramid in the centre of a dish, around which place tastefully-ornamented slices of the cold and substantial soup, cut into sUces about the size and thick- ness of calf's liver that is usually served up with bacon. Garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs and lemon. This, if properly managed, forms not only a pretty-looking spring dish, but a most excellent one.

610 DINER LUCTJLLUSIAN. [Note. Tlic tradespeople received tlieii- orders a week previous to the dinner. Tlic finest nrallcts I ever saw, as well as tlie Severn salmon, were obtained at Grove's, in Bond Street; the remainder of the fish was from Jay's, Hunger- ford Mai-ket. At seven o'elock the live Severn salmon was brought to me, it having just arrived dii-ect from Gloucester, and was boiled innncdiately, being just ten nunutes before the dinner was placed upon the table, and was eaten in its greatest possible perfection. The iinest of the poultry came from Bailey's, Davis Street, Grosvenor Square, and Townsend's, Charles Street, Haymarket. The foies gras and some very fine ft-esh Pi-ench truffles came from Morel's; the hors-d'-ceuvres, from Edges and Butler's, Regent Street. Tlie saddleback of lamb came from Newland's, Air Street, Piccadilly, the Welsh mutton from Slater's, and the young green peas and a very expensive dessert came from Solomon's, Covent Garden. My being so minute in mentioning the name of the above tradespeople is not to advertise their fame in their different specialities, as that I believe they have already acquired, but merely to prove the trouble a real gom-met vsdU take to furnish his table, Mr. S. haviag called many times upon several of them himself, previous to this pai'ty taJdng place, to ascertaiir what his dinner was to be composed of. The most expensive dishes were the mullets, the salmon, poulardes a la Nelson, and, above aU, the crawfish which, when dressed, cost upwards of seven guineas.]

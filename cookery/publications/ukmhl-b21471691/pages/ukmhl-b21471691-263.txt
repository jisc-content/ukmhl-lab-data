REMOVES. 215 brown sauce, reduce quickly, keeping it stirred all the tmie, until it adheres to the back of the spoon, add a little salt if required; pour the sauce over the whole and serve. No. 522. Poulardes aux legumes verts. Roast the poulardes in vegetables as usual, then take ten large turnips, cut each in halves exactly in the centre, peel them thin without leaving the marks of the knife, and scoop out the centres to form them into cups, with a round cutter the size of half-a-crown-piece, cut twenty pieces of tm-nip one inch in thickness to form stands, stew them nicely in stock as in the last, but not too much done, and place them in the bain marie till ready to serve, then place a border of mashed potatoes round the interior of the dish, leaving sufficient room for yom- poulardes, and at each end stick a croustade of bread cut in cups but larger than those of turnips, place the turnip cups upon their stands at equal distances apart upon the mashed potatoes, place a nice head of cauhflower upon each croustade, have ready boiled some very young peas and heads of asparagus, fill the cups alter- nately with each, place your poulardes in the centre, and have ready the following sauce: put two quarts of white sauce (No. 7) and a pint of white stock in a stewpan, with the glaze from the tm-nips, reduce to two-thii'ds, skim, season with a little salt and sugar, finish with a gill of cream, sauce all over, but lightly over the vegetables, and serve. Capons may of course be dressed in the same manner as poulardes for removes, but to give a second series would only be a useless repetition. No. 523. Petits Poulets a la Warenzorf. Procure four very nice spring chickens trussed as for boiling, roast them in vegetables, as described (No. 417), have also ready boiled and nicely trimmed two deer tongues.

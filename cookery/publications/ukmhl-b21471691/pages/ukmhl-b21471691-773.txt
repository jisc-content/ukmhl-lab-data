711 TO MAKE COFFEE IN AN ECONOMICAL MANNER. BY MY MENAGERE. After constant supplications to my menagere, I have obtained at last a valuable receipt of the method of making my coffee at home, which I must say she may well be proud of, havmg been continually complimented by my guests on account of its excellence. It was only by touching her vanity, and assiu-ing her that it was not to obhge me but the pubhc at large, that she permitted me to give it pubhcity, on the condition, however, that her name be appended. " Buy your coffee not over bmiit; grind it at home if possible. Have a middle-sized filter like ours, which holds a httle more than a quart, and came from Jakes' or Benham's, I forget which (but that is of httle consequence, as you merely want the receipt), pour about a pint of boiling water into the filter to heat it tlu'ough, then empty it, and put a quarter of a pound of ground coffee on the filter; then put on the pressor, and lastly the grating; then pom- about half a pint of quite boiling water over it, put the cover on, and let it drain through. " After three or four minutes pom^ by degrees a pint and a half more boihng water, and when well passed through pour it from the filter into a very clean stewpan; set it on the corner of the the, and when a little white scum rises to the surface (not letting it boil) pour it a second time over the filter, and when passed through pom- either into the silver cafetiere or the cups. Serve boiling milk or cream in two small jugs, and white or brovm, or sometimes candied sugar." After promising her a fine gown for her kindness, I gave her a pen to sign her name. " But stop," says she, " I forgot that for yom- breakfast the next day I use a system of economy which I think will please: as soon as I have poured the coffee from the coffee-pot, I put another quart of boiling water over it. This I find saves me an ounce of coffee by boiling it instead of water, and poming it over as before." (Signed) - Irma de L'Ombre."

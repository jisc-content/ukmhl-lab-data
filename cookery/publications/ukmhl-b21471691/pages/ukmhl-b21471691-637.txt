APPENDIX. No. 1360. As^ic, Or Savoury Jelly, extracted from the succulence of meat, when well made, is very inviting at any season of the year, especially in the summer, besides being the principal orna- ment and garniture of those savoury dishes which reheve the monotony of the second com'se. The tediousness and expense of its preparation in the old-fashioned manner has often been the cause of its being omitted, which has also pre- vented gourmets from partaking of the second com^se, but where well served, its dehghtful flavour vdll restore, cleanse, and invigorate the palate, causing each guest to partake more freely of the savoury dishes, which will afford a zest to the delicate Lafitte or Chateau Margot, which flows so generously in the glasses of true epicures. By foRovdng closely my new receipt, I venture to say that any cook, with a Uttle experience, will produce an aspic fit for the table of a crowned head. Take two large knuckles of veal, which cut in large dice, having about six pounds of meat, well butter the bottom of a middling-sized stewpan, put in the meat, with one pound of lean ham and two calf's feet, cut up, breaking the bones, add half a gill of water, and place the stewpan over a sharp fire, stirring the meat round occasionally until the bottom of the stewpan is covered with a whitish glaze, then fill it up with five quarts of water, add three onions.

294 ENTREES. No. 696. Boudin de Veau a la Richelieu. ^ Butter a plain round mould rather thickly, have five or six good-sized truffles chopped very fine, throw them in the mould, which roll round until the sides are quite covered with them; then prepare a piece of bread as in the last, fill the space up with the same forcemeat, blanch it in a stew- pan as before, turn out on your dish, take away the bread, and serve with a sauce Perigueux (No. 55) over it. No. 697. Of Mutton for Entrees. For entrees the small South Down mutton is much to be preferred, the principal entrees made from mutton are cote- lettes, which never will be out of vogue; I shall therefore give a numerous list of receipts for the dressing of them, but the manner of cutting them requires particular atten- tion ; the most simple method is to take the chine-bone off from the neck neatly vsdth a saw, but not quite detaching all the meat from the bone, then cut it into chops, leaving a bone to each; with a knife cut off the skinny part from each side of the bone and a piece of the meat at the end of the bone, so as to leave a piece of bone about half an inch in length, then with a cotelette-bat beat them nearly to the same thickness as the bone, take the rough parts of the bone off with yom' chopper, and trim the cotelettes of a good shape, taldng off a greater part of the fat and romidiug the- lean part nicely; but in cutting cotelettes to look well, much depends upon the taste of the person, they require to be cut some time previous to cooking, or they would sluink and loose their shape.

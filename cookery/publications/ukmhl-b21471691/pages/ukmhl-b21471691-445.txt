ROASTS. 395 to be solid and to throw out a great heat, as it is always easy to keep anything a good distance from it, but a bad fii-e would be the destruction of anything placed before it, for if you had a couple of good fowls or a brace of birds, and were to put one down before a slow fire and the other before a brisk, you would be so astonished at the difference in flavoiu- that did you not know different you would declare that one was of an inferior quaHty; I am also very much against the improper manner of basting, which would give any birds or poultry the appearance of having been first roasted and afterwards stewed; I have never during the last six years suffered any bird to be basted in my kitchen with the exception of rubbing a piece of butter over the breast of poultry or game as soon as the skin becomes set; any kind of game or poultry is done when you perceive a great smoke arising from it, and if not taken up imme- diately you lose the flavour and the bird its appearance, for instead of going to table nice and plump it will present a mean and shrivelled object, loudly bespeaking the cook's inattention, unless it has been kept in a screen or hot closet, by the party having kept the dinner waiting. By following the above simple method great benefit wiW be derived in this simple branch of the art, but the most universally useful, for I thmk we may say without hesita- tion that near two thirds of om- annual and volatile food is daily roasted, which has made me so desirous of impressing the necessity of attention, which is all that is required to roast well.

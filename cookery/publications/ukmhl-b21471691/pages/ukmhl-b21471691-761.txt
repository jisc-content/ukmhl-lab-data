Throughout France, but in France only, this simple style of dressing a salad is fully appreciated the sight of which refreshes the eyes and revives the appetite; I never heard (in France) any one say, after a copious dinner, this is too much and useless, but, on the contrary, every one reserves, if not an appetite, at least the shade of one for the approaching salad, the simpUcity of its seasoning and its trifling expense principally causing it to be thus popular and so freely par- taken of. 1 have never given a smaU party at home but my guests have been at all times anxious to partake of my French salad, which I simply make as follows: • / n I procure a quantity of salad of any description the most m season (all descriptions of salad being dressed in the same manner, one receipt will do for the whole), but my favorite salad being endive, that is the one I shall here describe. Take four or five heads of very white endive, detach all the green leaves, and wash each head well in a pail of cold water, but not leaving them in the water, or they would eat quite bitter, which, for my own part, I do not much .object to, but many persons do ; when clean cut each head in halves down the centre, cut off the* roots, which throw away, lay the endive in the centre of a clean cloth, which take by the four corners and shake until the salad is per- fectly dry; then put it into a convenient-sized salad-bowl, season with three saltspoonfuls of salt, two of white pepper, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar,, six of salad-oil, and one of tarragon and chervil chopped very fine, then stir up lightly with a spoon and fork, and when well mixed let each guest help themselves. Another method of dressing an endive salad, which, in the opinion of the generality of my guests, is the most preferable in point of flavour, is to rub the salad-bowl with a piece of fresh peeled garlic, then lay in the salad ; have three or four pieces of crust of bread, about the size of shiUiugs, let each' be well rubbed with the garlic, season and stir well together as before. Should any ladies, however, be going to partake of it, the bowl and crusts

X PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. Bouquet cle Gibier, which met with so much success in London and Paris last Christmas, and offers to noblemen and gentlemen a new and pleasing mode of making pre- sents of game. The one I presented to His Majesty Louis Phihppe, with a copy of this work, met with the highest approbation from the com-t of France, and was most handsomely ac- knowledged by his Majesty. I now most humbly return thanks to the public for theu- kind encouragement, and trust that the success I have hitherto had may stUl be continued. ALEXIS SOYER. DUBLIN ; St. Patrick's Day, 1847.

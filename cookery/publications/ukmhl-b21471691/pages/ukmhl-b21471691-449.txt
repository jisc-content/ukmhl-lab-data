No. 949. Foulet roti. For a dmner of four entrees you would require two fowls, but not too large, truss and roast them as directed for a tm^key, judging the time requhed according to their size, serve with gravy and watercresses; they may be larded, barded, or served in any way mentioned in the foregoing re- ceipts ; a fowl weighing two pounds and a half would require half an horn' roasting, or three quarters of an hour if larger. No. 950. Spring Chickens I â–  Are served like fowls, generally plain roasted, but they may be lai'ded or dressed a la Stael (No. 948) as the pou- larde. Be particular in tying the legs upon paper to the spit, as directed for the tm'key, as it so improves their appearance when roasted. About twenty-five minutes would be sufficient to roast them. No. 951. Spring Chickens a la Forrester. Truss them as directed for poularde (No. 947), but roast them quite plain, not very brown; have two good handfuls of very fresh water-cresses, pick off all the stalks, and one of small salad mixed well together, and completely cover the chickens with it, serve a Uttle gravy on the dish with some separate, and a boat of bread sauce.

KEMOVES. 179 Strasburg bacon, cut in the shape and size of cutlets; di^ess them on the potatoes round the veal, pour a sauce poivrade (No. 32) into the dish, but not over the bacon; glaze the bacon, and serve. The Strasburg bacon being very diy, requires soaking at least twenty-four hoiu-s; it must be allowed to simmer until very tender; place it be- tween two dishes, with a weight upon it, and when cold cut it into the shapes required, and make them hot in good white stock. Good streaky bacon may be used instead of the Strasburg, if it is difficult to obtain. No. 445. Fillet of Veal a la Princiere.

POISSONS. '^^ cut it up in slices tln-ee inches in thickness, and lay them in spring water for a quarter of an hour; or if the fish is wanted to be served whole, merely cut incisions upon each side to the bone, about two inches apart, and lay it m spring water three quarters of an hour. Whitings. Cut out the gills, and open the beUy; wash them and cut ofie the fins; if for frying, cut off the flaps under the neck of the fish, then pass yora knife Hghtly from the head to the tail, down the back, merely cutting through the skin; then detach the skin at the head, and puU it aU off one side together, and then the other; then put the tail into the mouth, and run a peg through the nose and tail, to keep it in that position. Haddocks Are cleaned in the same manner as whitings, but not skinned or trussed, as they are seldom fried. Salmon. Cut out the gills, open the belly, and take out the inside, which wash hghtly; .scrape off the scales, and cut it in shces, or serve whole; if it is to be crimped, you must let the scales remain; crimp it m the same manner as cod-fish.

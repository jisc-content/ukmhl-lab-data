No. 634. Casserole de Biz a la Chevaliere. Prepare a casserole as before, prepare two chickens as directed in the entree a la chevaliere (No. 818); fill yom- casserole, by placing the pieces of back at the bottom, then the legs and pinions, pour the sauce and garniture over, dress the four larded fillets to meet in a point, and finish by placing a small white head of cauliflower, nicely boiled, on the top, in the centre of the fiUets, and serve. When you serve a dinner where four entrees and two flancs are required, it is the object of the host to see his table weU garnished; and no hors-d'ceuvres being served, you may make flancs of them, although, I must repeat, flancs ought to be composed of one sohd piece, or, at any rate, not more than two or three pieces, but circumstances may require a deviation from this rule; I have therefore given a list of those hors-d'ceuvres which may be used for flancs, by adding to the number required for a dish, and maldng them rather larger; the croustades de beurre and timbales must be dressed in a cu'cle on a border of mashed potatoes, and the petits vol-au-vents in pyramid on a napkin. i

I 230 f LANGS. Flancs are required in every dinner where there are more than four entrees; they are served upon oval dishes of from eighteen inches in length to nme in width, and require a little depth; for flancs being made chshes, lilce removes, the dish must contain the sauce. My readers will perceive by the Index that many of them are like the removes; but these I shall merely give references to, my object in placing them with the flancs being to show that by being reduced in size they will do for flancs in large rhnners, and also be an assistance in the making of bills of fare. Flancs are to be made of one or two sohd pieces of poultry, game, butcher's meat, or pastry, and keep every- thing which is divided into many pieces, as cotelettes, fillets, escalopes, fricassees, salmis, &c., for entrees as much as much as possible, by doing which you will add more im- portance to your dinner, and cause more harmony in the arrangement.

Procure a piece of fillet of beef fifteen inches in length, lard, trim, and dress it as directed (No. 417); when ready to serve dress a border of mashed potatoes on yom- dish; have ready twenty young carrots, twenty yomig turnips, with twenty small, onions, dressed as directed for poulardes (No. 521); dish them upon the mashed potatoes with a small cauliflower nicely boiled at each end of the dish, place your fillet in the centre, glaze it, and sauce with a demi-glace, made also as directed for the poulai-des, but half the quantity will be sufficient.

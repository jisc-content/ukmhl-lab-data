94 POISSONS. JPerch Are very difficult to scrape; they must be done almost ahve: form the fish hke an S, and scrape it with an oyster- knife; open the beUy and take out the inside; puU out the gills, and wash weU; when large, they are often boiled with the scales on, and they are taken off afterwards, which IS much easier; but it depends upon how they are to be cooked. Eels. KiU them by knocking their heads upon a block or any- thing hard; then take the head in your hand with a cloth, aud just cut through the skin round the neck, and turn it down about an inch; then pull the head with one hand and the skin with the other, it will come off with facihty; open the belly and take out the inside; cut off the fins and those bristles that run up the back; if the eel is large and oily, hold it over a charcoal fire, moving it quickly all the while; but the small ones wiU not require it. Nothing is harder to kill than eels; and it is only by kiUing, or rather stunning them in the manner above described that they suffer the least. Lampreys Are cleaned in the same manner as eels, but do not re- quire skinning.

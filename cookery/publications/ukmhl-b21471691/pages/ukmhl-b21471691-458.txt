ROASTS. 408 stand a bird upon, dress them slantwise on your dish with gravy sufficient to Hghtly moisten the toast, and some sepa- rate in a boat; they may also be barded with a piece of bacon tied over the breast not too thick, but they will require rather longer to roast. The beak may be made to form the skewer. No. 976. Woodcocks a la Stdel. Truss as before, put them down to roast, when down two minutes rub butter over, and shake flour gently but continually over them till done, it wiU give them quite a new appearance, and are by many preferred to plain roasted; serve them on a toast as before. No. 977. Woodcocks a la fumee de Gibier. Roast as before and serve with a sauce fumee de gibier (No. 60), which you have finished with a pat of butter. Although I recommend that this dehcate bird should be served plain roasted, yet it maybe served with advantage as above directed. No. 978. Woodcocks a la Piedmontaise. Roast as before then cut fom- large truffles in shces, fry them a few minutes in oil, then pour off the oil, add ten tablespoonfuls of sauce fumee de gibier and a little sugar, boil altogether two minutes, dress the bhds on toast, sauce over and serve. No. 979. Larks Are very dehcious little birds, about twelve or fifteen are sufficient for a dish; they are usuaUyroasted plain, or with a thin slice of fat bacon tied over them, and served with a Httle gravy in the dish and crumbs of fried bread round; they requii-e about eight mmutes to roast them well.

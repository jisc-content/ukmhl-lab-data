ENTREES. 273 pom- the glaze over the tongue, and serve; if the carrots are old they reqiiii-e to be stewed separately, as they take so much longer than the turnip or onion. No. 646. Turban de Langue de Bceuf, sauce piquante. Prepare twelve pieces of tongue as before, either pickled or fresh, dress them round upon your dish, put a pint of sauce piquante (No. 27) in the saute-pan with a little sugar, boil altogether a minute, sauce over, and serve immediately; you can also serve dressed spinach or endive (Nos. 106 and 119) with it; if you serve an entree of pickled tongue, it should be placed near an entree of fowl or veal, or near to a remove of the same description, vsdth which they eat much better, and for entrees of fresh tongue, season the sauces rather high. No. 647. Queues de Bceuf aux navets au brun. A few very nice entrees may be made of ox-tails; they certainly do not make handsome ones, but their delicate flavour supplies their deficiency in appearance. For one entree take two fine tails, cut them at the joints into pieces, or saw them into pieces an inch thick, which last way in my opinion is best, the pieces not being so clumsy; when cut put them into a stcM^an, vsdth three large onions, one carrot, one turnip, six cloves, a blade of mace, four bay-leaves, four sprigs of thyme, and a table- spoonful of salt; cover them with second stock or water, place the stewpan over the fu'e, and let it boil at the corner till the pieces are tender, and leave the bone easily; when done lay them on a cloth to drain, put a Httle mashed po- tatoes upon the bottom of your dish, build up the pieces pyramidically, and have ready the following sauce: scoop fifty pieces of turnips the size of small marbles, put them in a stewpan with half a'tablespoonful of powdered sugar 18

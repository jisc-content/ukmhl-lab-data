THE GASTEONOMIC REGENEMTOE. SAUCES. The first eight sauces are what we term Poundation sauces; but to facilitate and simplify the making of aR kinds of made dishes, I have throughout this work princi- pally referred to the Brown Sauce (No. 1), and the White Sauce (No. 7), which are the two sauces I daily and prin- cipally use. The others are of course very good, and some- times necessary; but being more comphcated, I would re- commend that they be left to cuhnary artists, who can easily surmount this difficulty. The two above-mentioned sauces reqmre nothing but a little care and attention; if well made, you will have little trouble with the smaller sauces; for the foundation sauces being well made, the smaller ones require httle more than the ingredients directed for them, to give them then proper flavour; but if badly made, it would injure the whole dinner. The above-named sauces will keep four or five days in summer, and a week in winter, by adding a quart of hght broth, and boihng them up every day in summer, and every other day in winter. The following proportions in the foundation sauces are sufficient for a large dinner; but of course where so much IS not required, a quarter, or even a smaller quantity can be made.

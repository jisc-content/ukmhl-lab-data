THE TENDON SEPARATOR. comes to table, the carver lias merely to pass the knife in the usual manner to take up the wings and legs, and finds no resistance; the same at the breast and the back, ^.here it may easily be seen whilst carving that it has already been prepared. Three minutes is about the time taken by this new process to cut into ten parts an ordinary fowl. For a Turkey or a Goose, the sinews are divided as above, and in the act of carvmg, instead of cutting the fiUets in a straight line with the breast-bone, you separate them obUquely, and aU other parts as usual Pheasants, Ducks, and all Wild Fowl especially, must be prepared in a similar manner. A Hare or Rabbit may also have the sinews and back-bone divided; to effect this you lay the hare upon its back, and give six cuts nearly through the back-bone, holding the Separator with both hands, through the belly part; then you truss it for roasting. If it should happen to be a very large hai-e, the fillets only are carved, and they ought to be cut in thin shces in an oblique direction, instead of straight along the back.

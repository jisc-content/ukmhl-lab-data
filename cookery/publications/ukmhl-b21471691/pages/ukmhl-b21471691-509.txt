VEGETABLES. 459 No. 1074. Artichaux a la Bruxellaise. Dress a border of artichokes as in the last, upon a border of mashed potatoes, and have ready a quart of very nice Brussel sprouts dressed a la maitre d'hotel (No. 1083), which cbess in pyramid in the centre. This dish can only be served in the autumn season of the year, as it is only then both vegetables can be obtained. No. 1075. Peas. The best of all green vegetables, and the dehght of mil- hons, whilst then* profusion renders them attamable by aU; like the asparagus, they belong to that season of flavour, the spring of the year, but remain m season till a much later j)eriod; when young the EngHsh method of cooking them is good, because the more succulence there is in a vegetable the less zest they require to make them palatable. To describe the difierent sorts would be almost an endless, and to a certain extent a useless task, but the Prussian blues are, in my opinion, the very best; to plain boil them, have two quarts of fresh-sheUed peas, with a sprig of young mint, about ten leaves (the greatest fault with most people is putting too much), have a gallon of water boihng upon the jfire, in which you have put two ounces of salt, when boil- ing put in your peas, let them boil as fast as possible from ten to fifteen minutes, try whether they are tender, if so strain them through a cuUender, dress them upon your dish with two pats of butter upon the top and serve; or when drained put them into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a good teaspoonful of powdered sugar, place over a fire, and keep tossing them until the butter is melted, dress them either plam upon your dish or in a bread croustade.

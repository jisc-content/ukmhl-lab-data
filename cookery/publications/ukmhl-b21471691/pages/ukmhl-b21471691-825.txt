THE GASTRONOMIC REGENERATOR. OPINIONS OP THE PRESS. THE TIMES. Tlic Gastronomic Regenerator.— Tlie Modern Cook.—"Any body cun dine," says the clever and prolbund author ol' the < Original,' " but very few know how to dine so as to ensure the greatest quantity of lieallb and enjoyment.'' The pith and truth of this remark are un- questionable ; and, indeed, we know nothing more painful than that utter disregard of the very first principles of gastroniuiiic science evinced by so many unprincipled and reckless individuals of the present day, wl)o eat as though the sole object of eating were to sustain life. Not that they take the best means for accomplishing even that ignoble end. The rules, whose observance renders eating a luxury and an art, also conduce in the highest degree to health. Sacrifices to Ceres and Bacchus, in the very act of the ottering, should have a sweet fragrance in the nostrils of Hygeia. Who shall aflix a boundary to the possible progress of an art? Let the vulgar do so, who, struck by apparent perfection, conclude at once that the force of genius " can no further go." We assert fearlessly that the limits of human creation and improvement are yet unknown. Least of all are they to be defined with reference to that great art which has been styled " the standard and gauge of human civiliziition,"' and which Montaigne, with less respect, denommated th« science de la gueide. Sceptics were they who, revelling at the table of Louis Xiy in the sauces of a Bechamel, or lingering at the board of the great Conde over the chejs dxuvre ol a Vatel—that illustrious martyr to a point of culinary honour!—or inhalin"- gently and delicately, and degustating slowly, and with mai-vellous discrimination, the exqui- site and qumtessential results of the vigils of an Ude, who refused, in their turns, to believe that the science professed by these great men could be capable of improvement, or was susceptib e ol higher elevation. Alas ! have we not lived to vote the resources of all ver- and rococo, and to behold the precious laurels that wreathed the temples of the culinary demigods of the ISth cenUiry, transferred by accl.-mation in the 19th to the mighty brows o a Careme and a Leauvilliers, a Soyer and a Francalelli-great names every one—poetizer.s fuller'tlTn nni r''. the larder sublime fire-worshippers, high priests of a kitchen luller than Druidical groves of deep and sacred mysteries ? irtists%o whon!''^ important volumes before us are characteristic of the distinguished m! / or M p owe l,em.

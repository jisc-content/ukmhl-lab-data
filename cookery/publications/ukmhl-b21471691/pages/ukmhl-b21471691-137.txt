When the calf's head is cold take off all the meat and fat, leaving nothing but the glutinous part, which cut mto pieces an inch square ; when ready to serve the soup put about three quarts (to each tureen), into a stewpan with twenty of the pieces of head and a glass of sherry, boH alto- gether fifteen minutes, when skim and serve very hot. This soup may likewise be thickened without a roux, as directed for brown sauce (No. 4). Forcemeat and egg-balls were formerly served in this soup, the latter in imitation of tm^- tles' eggs, but better imitations of bullets, and almost as in- digestible ; the omission of them will, I am certain, prove beneficial, for whether the stomach be strong or dehcate it will not bear loading with ammunition of that description. The above soup requires to be a hght brown colour, and for thickness it must adhere Hghtly to the back of the spoon.

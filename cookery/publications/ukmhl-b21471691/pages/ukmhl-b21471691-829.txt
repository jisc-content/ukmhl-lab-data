11 caused liini "n llirill of horror;" but being in a library in the midst of a hall, where be met with of Milton's iilleproricnl works, Loclvc's profound ideas, and several c/iefs (Cmitvre of that noble champion of lileratiire, Shakspeare, what should his eye turn to but a cookery- book closeted in such company ! " The terrifying eflect of that succulent volume" made him determine that he never would write a book of the culinary sort. What was the consequence ? The very determination not to write, forced him into "n thousand gastronomic reflections." Write he must, and it was sheer modesty that gene- rated the Regenerator. Mark the pleasantry upon the word " lost," the last word in the preface, and fancy Soyer lost in Paradise. Tempter ! if you had been in any such place, to what could you not have persuaded the first gourmand ! In fine, Soyer determined to write this book, because he justly " considered that the pleasures of the table are an every-day enjoyment, ivhich reflects good and evil on all classes" And when we remember that he has written the work in ten months, during which he has also supplied 25,000 dinners to the gentlemen of the Reform Club, and 38 dinners of importance, comprising 70,000 dishes ; that he had to provide daily for 60 servants, and to do the honours of the club to 1.^,000 visitors, one may fancy what genius and perseverance can accomplish. He sa3's he is " entirely satisfied with the composition, distribution, and arrangement of the volume." Elegit momtmentirm in fact. He has been and done it. He gives you his signature, his portrait e7i buste, and another full length, in which he is represented in his parlour at home (w iiere, in spite of his avocations, he has leisure to receive his friends and consume a most piodigious quantity of victuals), surrounded by a select society of private friends, dispensing to them some of the luxuries which he describes in his 700 pages. After a few prefatory observations about carving, for which he has invented a new and apparently successful, though unintelligible method—iibout larding, which he recommends to the English " middle classes"—the seasons offish and game, &c.—the utensils for the kitchen—Soyer plunges into sauces at once, as the great test of culinary civilization. The key-sauces are the White Sauce, No. 7, and the Brown Sauce, No. 1. They are the prin- cipia of the science—they are the sauces which Soyer daily and principally uses. If the reader suspects that we are going to transcribe the formula for the preparation of these sauces, be is disappointed. No; let those who want the sauce buy the book, and enjov both. ' ' ^ ' From sauces we go to "Potages or Soups" (and what are these, in fact, but diluted and agreeable sauce ?), commencing with the clear light broth, or first stock of soup, and pro- ceeding to a hundred delicious varieties—the Louis Philippe, the Jerusalem, the Marcus- Hill, the Princess Royal, &c. Nothing can be jnore delicate or worthy of a young princess than this latter little soup ; whereas the " potage a la com'tesse," beginning with " cut half a pound of lean ham with an onion," is of a much stronger charfftter. All these soups are flavoured with appropriate observations, as, for instance—" In fact it is much better for all h^k soups to be too thin than too thick." Louis Philippe soup, he says, should contain Brussels sprouts, bmled very green." Here is surely some wicked satire here. Irom soup we come to fish, as in the order of nature; thence to the hors-d'oeuvre and removes, to the flancs, the entrees, the roasts, the vegetables, the sweets, or the entremets, and the second-course removes. As the critic reads from page to page his task becomes absolutely painful, so de icious is the style, so " succulent" are the descriptions, and so pro- voking the hunger which they inspire. Every now and then you get anecdotes, histodcal and topographical allusions, &c. (See p. 472.) ■'6 , i. i i-ai How finely it is written ! " Will your excellency call to-morrow morning ?"

POISSONS. 146 No. 3G4. I^erch a la HoUandaise. Have three middling-sized fishes ready prepared for cook- ing ; then put two ounces of butter, two onions (in shces), one carrot (cut small), some parsley, two bay-leaves, six cloves, and two blades of mace in a stewpan; pass it five minutes over a brisk fire, then add a quart of water, two glasses of vinegar, one ounce of salt, and a little pepper; boil altogether a quarter of an hour, and pass it through a sieve into a small fish-kettle; then lay the fishes into it, and let them stew twenty or thu'ty minutes over a moderate fire; dress them on a dish without a napkin, and pour a sauce HoUandaise (No. 66) over them. No. 365. Perch a la Maitre d'Hotel. Prepare and cook your fish as above; then put twenty tablespoonfuls of melted butter in a stewpan, and when it is upon the point of boihng, add a quarter of a pound of Maitre d'Hotel butter (No. 79) and pom^ the sauce over the fish, which dress on a dish without a napkin. No. 366. Small Perches en water souchet. Cut four small fishes in halves, having previously taken off all the scales, and proceed precisely as for Floimders en water souchet (No. 331). No. 367. Small Perches frits au beurre. Scale and well dry six perches, and make incisions here and there on each side of them; then put a quarter of a pound of butter into a saute-pan, season yom- fishes with pepper and salt, put them in the saute-pan and fiy them gently, tiuning them carefully; when done, di-ess them on a napkin, garnish with parsley, and serve A^dthout sauce. In my opinion, they are much better cooked this way

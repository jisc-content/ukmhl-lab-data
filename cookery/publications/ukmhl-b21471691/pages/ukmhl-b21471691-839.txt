21 waves, and sails. On the same principles a club is preferable to a family fireside, and the lot of a bachelor to the fate of a Benedict. M. Soyer, speaking ex cathedrd from the kitchen of the Reform Club, would find it no easy matter to parry the cogency of this reasoning. He forgets, apparently, that he bares his breast to a most I'ormidable attack. What right have MEN to be cooks ? What hypocrisy it is to regret that women cannot eat those dinners which vpomen alone are entitled, according to the laws of nature and the usages of Britain, to dress ! Be just before yon att'ect to be generous ! Surrender the plajp, and the privileges, and the immunities, which are the heritage and birthright of the petticoat! Hercules with a distaft'was bad enough ; but where, in the vagaries and metamorphoses of heathen mythology, do you read of Hercules with a dishclout' VVliat would the moon sixy, should the sun insist on blazing away all night as well as all day ? Your comparisons are full of poetry and humbug. A kitchen without a female cook—it is like a flowerless garden, n vvaveless sea, a sailless ship. A kitchen with a male cook—is a monster which natural history rejects, and good feeling abhors. The rights of women are scarcely best vindicated by him who usurps the most precious of them. There will be time to complain of their absence from the scene, when, by a proper self-ostracism, you leave free for them the stage which it becomes them to occupy. These are knotty matters, M. Soyer, for digestion. With so pretty a quarrel we shall not interleie, having a wholesome respect for an Amazoniaa enemy who can stand fire like salamanders. To be candid, we are puzzled by the sprightli- ness of our own fancy, and do not very distinctly comprehend how we have managed to involve the Regenerator, whose thoughts were bent on the pale and slim sylphs of the boudoir, in a squabble with the rubicund and rotund vestals who watch the inextinguishable flames of The Great Hearth. This marvellous dialogue, from which we have taken with our finger and thumb a tit-bit here and there, might be the text for inexhaustible annotation. It occupies no more than two pages ; but, as Gibbon has said of Tacitus, " they are the pages of Soyer." Every topic within the range of human knowledge is touched, by direct exposition or collateral allusion. The metaphysician and the theologian, the physiologist and the moralist, are all challenged to investigate its dogmas, which, let us forewarn them, are so curtly, positively, and oracularly propounded, as, if orthodox, to need no commentary; and if heterodox, to demand accumulated mountains of controversy to overwhelm them. For he, we believe, can Woodcock a la Stael,'' and " Filets de Ba?uf farcis a hi Dr. Johnson." The constitution of English cookery is precisely similar to the constitution of the English language. Both were prophetically sketched by Herodotus in his description of the ar mv of Xerxes, which gathered its numbers, and strength, and beauty from "all the quarters m the sliipman s card. That imperishable mass of noble words—that glorious tongue in which Soyer has prudently written ' The Gastronomic Regenerator,' is in itself an un- equalled specimen of lelicitous cookery. The dishes which furnished the most recherch6 dinner Soyer ever dressed, the Diner Lucullusian a la Sampayo." being resolved into the chaos whence they arose in faultless proportions and resistless grace, would not disclose elements and ingredients more heterogeneous, remote, and altered from their iirimal nature, ^ n !ff r fF *° °^ '■'^^ sentences in which he tells us of thi fT A thousand years and a thousand accidents, the fnllv h?. f ^^"^ '''5'"?,' '"^''""ity. the most delicate wit and most outrageous folly h ^y^h^en co-operat.ng in the manufacture of the extraordinary vocabulary which has enabled the Regenerator himself to concoct the following unparalleled receiutfoiTl e Celestial and Terrestrial Cream of Great Britain.

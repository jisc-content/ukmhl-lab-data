IMPORTANT. DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPOSITION OF THIS WORK. To sustain and deserve the title of " Gastronomic Regeneratoi'," nothing but an entire change from the system of any other publication on the art of Cookery would be admissible, it is now in the hands of ray readers to judge for themselves, and to stamp its character according to its merits, either as an original or a copy; to avoid the last, however, I have closely studied to introduce the greatest novelty in every depart- ment, and have entirely omitted all unnecessary confusion, which, in many previous works, have rendered them unintelligible to the un- initiated, and almost impracticable to the initiated; however, many old and useful receipts, too good to be omitted, will be found much sim- pMed^to reduce them to a practical point. I have also minutely studied the disposing and arranging of the building of all sized kitchens, from the one of the Reform Club and the Kitchen of the Wealthy to the humble one of the cottage, which cannot fail to prove useful when closely followed, as six years of expeiience in the kitchen of the Reform Club* has fvdly proved to me that tliose useful departments have not only previously been much neglected, but in many instances at a very great expense stdl worse arranged for want of practical knowledge, and considering that the pleasures of the table are an every-day enjoyment which reflects good and evil on all classes, my readers I am sure will agree with me that thie proper disposing of such an important depai-tment deserves some little attention, for food uncomfortably prepared is almost always unsightly, unwholesome, and consequently indigestible, not being cleanly prepared. I have Ukewise omitted in this work the placing of a long series of bills ot fare, which has been done in every previous pubUcation; although they might have proved useful in some few circumstances, they are seldom referred to, and often create confusion in the composition of a dinner by the difficulty of procuring perhaps the identical comestibles required m the receipts which the bills of fare refer to; and more I would venture to say, that in no circumstances have those bUls of fare been correctly followed; the only three I have introduced being one to arrange my pagodatique service to grace the Table of the Wealthy, the other the LucuUusian dinner, and the dinner of my Table at Home, which touncl at the end ol t)ic Receipts devoted to the Kilclicu of the Wealtliy.

KITCHEN AT HOME. 687 they more frequently use sheep's blood, using the interior and all, in the same proportions as if made of a pig, adding oatmeal, omitting part of the onions, and using the larger entrails. It being usual in this country to introduce leeks, you must then omit the bread crumbs and rice, or part of the onions. To prevent the blood curd- hng, it must be salted, by adding a handful of salt, and whiskmg weU for ten minutes as soon as you obtain it from the pig. â€ž , i vr Rice well boiled in broth but not too much so is an exceHent addition to black puddings (half a pound for the above quantity being quite sufficient), or grated bread; leeks also may be used instead of endive, or both may be omitted. I have mentioned these dilferent articles, that if one cannot be pro- cured another might be used instead, fiU also very even, mixing fat and aU well together, carefully avoid letting any air get in, or they would burst m boihng. No. 181. Excellent Sausage Cakes. Chop some lean pork very fine, having previously detached all the skin and bone, and to every pound of meat add three quarters of a pound of fat bacon, half an ounce of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, the quarter of a nutmeg grated, six young green chopped onions, and aUttle chopped parsley ; when the whole is well chopped put into a mortar and pound well, finishing with three eggs, then have ready a pig's caul, which cut into pieces large enough to fold a piece of the above preparation the size of an egg, which wrap up, keeping the shape of an egg, but rather flattened, and broil very gently over a moderate fire. No. 182, Pigs' Feet. Procure six pig's feet, nicely salted, which boil in water, to which you have added a few vegetables, until well done, cut each one in halves, take out the long bone, have some sausage-meat as in the last, and a pig's caul, which cut into pieces each large enough to fold half a foot, well surrounded with sausage-meat, when well wrapped up broil slowly half an hour over a moderate fire, and serve. Or, when the pigs' feet are well boiled, egg over, and throw them into some grated crust of bread, with which you have mixed a little parsley, broil a nice colour and serve with a little plain gravy. MADE DISHES FROM POULTRY. No. 183. Blanquettes of Turkey. With the remains of a roast or boiled turkey you may make a very nice blanquette, cutting the meat into smaU thin slices, chop up the bones and put them into a stewpan, with an onion, half a blade of mace, and a very little lean ham or bacon, just cover with water, boil twenty minutes, and with the stock make a white sauce as directed (No. 135), put the slices into a stewpan, just cover with a httle of the sauce, add a little white pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, make all hot together, not, however, allowing it to boil, finish with three tablespoonfuls of cream, mixed with the yolk of an egg, stir in quickly, pour out upon a dish, and serve with triangular scippets of fried or toasted bread round. When cucumbers are in season I frequently use one, cutting it in pieces two inches in length, which again spht into three, peel, and take out all the seeds, put them into a stewpan, with a few chopped onions, a httle butter, and sugar, and stew gently over a slow fire until tender, five minutes before serving add them to the blanquette, they being a great improvement.

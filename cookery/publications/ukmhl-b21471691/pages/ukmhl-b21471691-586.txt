ENTREMETS. 534 No. 1370. Charlotte de Pommes au Beurre. For the few following receipts, the russet apple is the one I should recommend, it being the most suitable, not being so watery, or falling in puree, but in case they cannot be obtained other sorts may be used, which will require to be more reduced in stewing. Well butter the interior of a plain round mould, then cut twelve pieces of bread the size and thickness of a shilling, dip them in clarified butter, and lay them in a circle round the bottom of youj mould; cut also eight small pieces in the shape of diamonds, dip them in butter, and with them form a star in the centre of the circle, cover the whole with a round piece of bread the size of the bottom of the mould and the thickness of a penny-piece, cut about thhty other pieces an inch wide and four inches in length, dip one after the other in clarified butter, which stand upright, one half way over the other, all round the interior of the mould ; then have ready prepared two dozen or more russet apples, which peel and cut in shoes, put them into a roimd- bottomed preserving-pan with six ounces of butter and half a pound of broken lump sugar, with a httle lemon-peel cut in strips, and a glass of sheriy, place them over a sharp fire tossing over occasionally, but keeping them together m a clke; when quite tender fill yom^ mould (having previ- ously weU egged and bread-crumbed the interior), place another round piece of bread (also egged and bread-cnmibed) over the apples, and stand the mould in a hot oven until the bread becomes well browned, take out and turn it over upon yom: dish, have a few spoonfuls of red cmTaiit jelly in a stewpan, with a glass of sheriy, melt it over the fii'e and when quite hot pom' round the charlotte; sugai' and salamander the top if not quite crisp, and serve.

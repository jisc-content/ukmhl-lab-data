The boiling of sugar is divided into seven different degrees, which may be ascertained by the following directions :â€” The first degree is known by dipping a copper skimmer into it whilst boihng, turning it over two or three times, if the sugar falls from it in sheets it has attained the first degree. The second is knovra by boiling yom' sugar rather longer, dipping yom' finger and thumb into cold water, then your finger into the boUing sugar, putting yom* finger and thumb together^ and again opening them, it will form a kind of thread; if it is too weak boil a little longer, this is the most useful degree for fruit or water ices. The thu'd degree is attained by boiling it a little longer, and trying it in the same manner, upon the thread break- ing, should it form a kind of pearl, it has attained the above degree; the sugar in boiling would also be covered with a quantity of small bubbles resembling pearls. The next degree is attained by boUing it still longer, dip a skimmer into it, tmm, take out and blow it hard, when the sugar will form little bladders and float in the air, this degree is called the souffle. Por the next degree boil stiU longer, trying it in the'' same manner, but blowing harder, the bladders will be larger and adhere together, forming feathers; this degree is called la plume, or the feather. The next is called au petite casee, and is obtained by boiling the sugar a little longer, to know this degree have a pint of cold water in a basin into which you have put a piece of ice, dip you finger into it, then into the boiling sugar, and then into the water again, take the piece which

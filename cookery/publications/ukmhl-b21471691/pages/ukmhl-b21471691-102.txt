POTAGES. aUy until the bottom is covered with a clear light glaze, then Mi It up with foiu- gaUons of hght broth (No. 133) or water; when boihng place it at the corner of the stove skim It well, add a good bunch of parsley, three sprigs of thyme, and two bay-leaves, a quarter of a pound of salt two leeks, and two heads of celery; let it simmer thi-ee hom-s, skim off all the fat, then pass it tln-ough a cloth into a basm, give it the colour of hght brown sherry with some brown gravy (No. 135), if sufficiently clear, which it will be if properly attended to. Some soups require to be Hghter and some browner than others, which is easily regulated by adding more or less of the gravy. But by placing the stew- pan over a slow fu-e when the stock is drawn down to a glaze, and allowing it to remain a short time, the glaze wiU become brownish, (but be careful not to let it burn,) when fill it up and your consomme will be sufficiently coloured.

This is a new mode of clari- fying and cannot fail. For the proportions for smaller quantities of consomme, to four pounds of veal put a quarter of a pound of ham, one ounce of butter, two onions, half a carrot, a turnip, half a leek, half a head of celery, a sprig of parsley, one of thyme, a bay-leaf, three cloves, six peppercorns, an ounce and a half of salt and four quarts of water; it wiU requu'e an horn* and three quarters boiling.

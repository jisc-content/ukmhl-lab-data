266 ENTREE S. Entrees require to be smaU and elegant, as weU as tasty; those which can be dressed in a crown hke cotelettes, que- neUes, or fillets of any description, are preferable, and'more graceful, the garnitiu-e being placed in the centre; they are also more hkely to be partaken of on account of the facihty of sending, they being ah-eady carved, and much better than large pieces, such as whole fowls, vol-au-vents, or pates chauds; where you require flancs, by all means reserve them for that purpose; but in a dinner of fom- entrees only, you require to send two entrees hght, and two (what I term) soUd, for the sake of variety, for if you had four Hght entrees upon the table without flancs, there would not appear sufficient dinner for the assembled guests, but the sohd entrees may be made to look exceedingly light if carried to a height corresponding to their breadth ; in dishing your entrees always allow an inch between the entree and the rim of the dish, or if the dishes are large leave more space; the round entree dishes are the most preferable, and should not be more than an inch and a half, or less than an inch in depth. No. 635. Of Beef for Entrees. Of all kinds of butchers' meat, beef, though so useful in cooking, presents the least variation for entrees, the fillet being the only part that can be used to any advantage. No. 636. Escalopes de Mlet de Bceuf a la Reform. Take out the fillet from beneath a rump of beef, take off all the fat, and cut it into slices (lengthwise) half an inch

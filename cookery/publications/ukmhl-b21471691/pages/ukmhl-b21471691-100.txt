To blanch Maccaroni. Have half a gallon of water in a stewpan in which put two ounces of butter and an ounce of salt; when boiling throw in a pound of maccaroni, which bod until tender, being care- ful that it is not too much done, the time of boiling depends principally upon the quahty, the Genoa maccaroni taking the longest time, and the Neapolitan the shortest, which last if too much done will fall in puree. No. 131. Croquettes de Pomme de Terre. Roast twelve fine potatoes; when done, take out the in- terior, which form into a ball; when cold put them into a mortar with a piece of butter half the size of the ball; pound them weE together, season with a little salt, pepper, chopped eschalots, chopped parsley, and grated nutmeg, mix them with the yolks of six and two whole eggs; then form them into croquettes about the size and shape of a large quenelle egg, and bread-crumb them twice over, and fry them to a light brown colom' in a stevrpan of hot lard, and serve as garni- ture where required. No. 132. Glaze. Make a good stock of veal or beef as directed for con- somme (No. 134), put the first and second stocks together in a large stewpan, the clearer the stock the better ; reduce it by boiling it fast, and when becoming rather thick pour it into a smaller stevq)an, stir it over a sharp fire until it has reduced to a proper consistency; use it where required. It may be put by in a bladder and kept a long time. Veal at all times makes the best glaze, but any kind of meat, game, or poultry, will produce more or less.

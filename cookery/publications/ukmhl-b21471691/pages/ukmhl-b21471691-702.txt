KITCHEN AT HOME. 640 a piece of butter over is not the least objectionable, as nothing can fall upon other joints but a little butter or clear fat, which cannot in the least interfere with the flavour of other meats, but still I would advise that lamb, veal, poultry, and even game, be kept at the top where there is beef, mutton, or pork roasting; this only applies to large estabhshraents. The above description is apphed for the kitchen of the wealthy, but I must confess I do not object to a small piece of beef for my kitchen at home; I should proceed precisely as above, only procuring a piece of not more than eight, ten, or twelve pounds in weight; put a Uttle water m the dripping-pan, place the beef upon a spit papered as before, put it very near the fire for a few minutes, rub over with butter, then put it back at the distance of two feet; let roast, if weighing from ten to twelve pounds, an hour and a half to two hours, depending much upon the fire, of which any person may judge with or without practice ; take it up, dress upon your dish, then have the contents of your dripping-pan in a basin, from which extract the whole of the fat, and pour the gravy over the chine-bones, it wiU be very good and save the trouble and expense of making gravy; a couple of Yorkshire puddings of two eggs each, are very excellent cooked under the meat; before I had a smoke-jack in my small kitchen I used to roast very well with a bit of string. For the cottage kitchen, where there is no smoke-jack provided, you may roast very well with a piece of worsted or string by hooking it to the meat, and then suspending it to a bracket fixed under the mantel-piece, which will enable you to remove it to any distance you thought proper from the fire, making a tea-tray, at the distance of three feet from the fire, act as a screen ; the bottle-jacks are not bad, but soon get out of repair. No. 2. Ribs of Beef. A piece of from twenty to twenty-five pounds makes a very pretty joint; trim neatly by sawing off the tips of the chine-bones to make it stand flat, saw also about three inches from the tips of the ribs, merely sawing through the bones, which detach from the meat, leaving a flap, which fold under and fix with wooden skewers, not, however, pulling it too tight, or it would cause the skin to crack in roasting, which would produce a very bad efiect; roast as directed for the sirloin, from two hours and a half to three hours would be sufficient, unless very thick. For a cold joint the ribs are better than the sirloin, which last should always be eaten hot. At home I often have a piece of ribs of beef weighing from six to eight pounds, and roast by passing a very thin spit through and placing it down before a moderate fire, or, if in a small cottage, hang it up with string as for the small sirloin; it would take from an hour and five minutes to an hour and a quarter roasting, being perpendicular you may baste it slightly as it does not receive much nourishment from its own fat. No. 3. Rump of Beef. This is also a very dehcate joint, but can only be had to perfection in the winter months, as it requires hanging from three weeks to a month before it is in readiness to roast to perfection ; procure one of from thirty to thirty-five pounds in weight, trim neatly, leaving all the fat, it taking so long to roast, should it be short of fat it would go to table qmte dry; roast it in a cradle-spit as directed for sirloin, but keepmg it still further from the fiire, and giving it from four hoiu-s and a half to five hours roasting, it might also be roasted in paste as directed for haunch of venison (No, 222), or wrap it up in several sheets of paper well buttered, and browned by taking off the paste twenty minutes before removing from the fii'e.

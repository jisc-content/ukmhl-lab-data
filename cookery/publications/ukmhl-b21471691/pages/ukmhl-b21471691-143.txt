95 POISSONS. No. 203. Turhot, to boil. A turbot must be well rubbed over with salt and lemon before it is put in the water; have ready a large turbot- kettle half full of cold water, and to every six quarts of water, put one poimd of salt, lay the fish in and place it over a moderate fire; a turbot of eight pounds maybe allowed to simmer twenty minutes or rather more, thus it will be about three quarters of an hour altogether in the water; when it begins to crack very shghtly, lift it up with the drainer and cover a clean white napkin over it; if you in- tend serving the sauce over your fish, dish it up without a napldn; if not, dish it upon a napkin and have ready some good sprigs of double parsley to garnish it with, and serve very hot. No, 204. Turbot a la Creme. Cook the turbot as above and dish it without a napkin, (but be careful that it is well drained before you place it on the dish, and absorb what water runs from the fish vrith a napkin, for that liquor would spoil your sauce, and cause it to lose that creamy substance which it ought to retain ; this remark apphes to all kinds of fish that is served up vdth the sauce over it); then put one pint of cream on the fire in a good sized stewpan, and when it is nearly simmering add half a pound of fresh butter, and stir it as quickly as possible until the butter is melted, but the cream must not boil; then add a liaison of three yolks of eggs, season with a Httle salt, pepper, and lemon juice, pour as much over the turbot as vnll cover it, and serve the remainder in a boat; or if not approved of, dish the fish on a napkin, garnish wdth parsley, and serve the sauce in a boat. This sauce must not be made until the moment it is wanted.

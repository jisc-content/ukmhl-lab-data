POISSONS. 147 than boiled or stewed; laxge fish may also be done this way, but they require more butter, and must cook very slowly. No. 368. Trout plain boiled. Trout that is caught in a river or running stream is pre- ferable to that caught in a lake or pond; although I have had very fine ones from ponds, they have invariably tasted muddy; in fact a running stream is better for all fish in this respect; but still water most affects the flavour of the trout. Prepare the fish for cooking, and boil it in salt and water; if it weighs two pounds, aUow it haK an hour, and more in proportion; dress it on a napkin, garnish with parsley, and serve shrimp-sauce in a boat. No. 369. Trout a la Maitre d'Hotel. Stew the fish hke perch, allowing more time in proportion to the size; dress them on a dish v^dthout a napkin, and sauce the same as Perche a la Maitre d'Hotel (No. 365). No. 370. Trout a la Genoise. Stew the fish as above, dress it on a dish without a nap- kin, and pour a sauce Genoise (No. 63) over it. No. 371. Baked Trout. Proceed exactly the same as for baked pike (No. 343.) No. 372. Trout a la Bey rout. Dry your fish with a cloth, flour it, and lay it on the gridiron; broil it nicely over a moderate fire; when done, peel off aU the skin; dish it without a napkin, and pour a sauce Beyrout (No. 64) over it.

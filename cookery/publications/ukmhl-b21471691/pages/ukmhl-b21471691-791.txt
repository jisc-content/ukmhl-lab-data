The above attelettes are qtiite new, the four large ones heing used for flancs or removeSj and garnished as represented in the plate containiag the croustades. They may also be gai-nished with vegetables turned of a good shape, and lightly stewed. The one representing a dolphin is used to garnish dressed fish, but must always be fixed upon a croustade, either at the head or in the centre of the dish, but so as not to interfere with the carving. The one representing a shell, as well as the last mentioned, are also used for any kind of aiguilettes or hors d'oeuvi-es (page 161); the four smaller ones are to be lightly garnished with fresh fruits, and fixed upon the top of the jeUy, the moulds for which are entitled jeUy-moulds for attelettes; the heads of these last four smaller attelettes should be made with gold, to correspond well with the richness of colour of tlie jelly.

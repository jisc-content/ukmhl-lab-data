MY KITCHEN AT HOME. Do not fancy, gentle reader, under tliis title to see a wonder of the age, as regards grandeur and magnitude, but for comfort and convenience you will find a correct miniature of the kitchen, the plan of which I have just de- scribed, the room being only large enough for one or two persons to work in instead of fourteen, and intended to supply parties of from eight to ten instead of a hundred and above ; whether of great or httle importance every- thing, more or less, has its share of merit when well-contrived, and by the same rule, these two culinary departments, although upon a very different scale, possess the same advantages. In pubUshing my plan of the kitchen of the Reform Club, many persons could not conceive my motive for so doing, saying that no private family would ever be in want of so large a kitchen, and it would be madness to go to such an expense, vrith which reason I fully concurred, but being aware at the same time that all my new plans and discoveries might be reduced to any scale, those just observations have induced me to make My Kitchen at Home as complete in its way as the other, and to be able to afford the facility to any man cook, if employed upon any extraordinary occasions, to dress a first-rate dinner, as well from the receipts adapted for the wealthy, as from those under the heading of My Kitchen at Home. The completeness of the arrangements, although much smaller, would at first become rather expensive, but would last almost for ever; should they, however, be too expensive for some of my readers, a reduction might be made in some of the fittings or apparatus, but still keeping to the same style, and retaining the most useful and serviceable, but as any curtailing would disfigure this Httle model, I will, for the convenience of some, present my readers with the plan of a smaller one, under the denomination of the Bachelor's Kitchen, which unfortunate class are often individually deprived of any kind of real homely comfort; and to be still more sociable, I have even added the smallest of all kitchens, being that of the Cottage. My intention, in giving the plans of several smaller kitchens, is to prove what I have before advanced, that I could easily introduce any of my plans, or apparatus, into kitchens of the smallest dimensions. I now must politely beg of my readers to refer to page 633, where they will see a correct plan of my smaU Kitchen at Home, under which title I shelter myself from culinary criticisms, because every man is, or ought to be, allowed to do anytliing he Ukes " at home."

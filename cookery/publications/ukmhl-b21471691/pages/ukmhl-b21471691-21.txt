XV NEW MODE OF CARVING. wai-dness. We reinember to have seen a man of high fashion deposit a turkey in this way in the lap of a lady, but with admirable compo- sure, and without offering the slightest apology, he finished a story which he was telling at the same time, and then, quietly turning to her, merely said, 'Madam, I'll thank you for that turkey.'" My conscience will not allow me to swear to the authenticity of the fact, but in the course of twelve months past I have witnessed a very simi- lar instance, only the party not possessing the assurance of the fashion- able above mentioned, did not continue the conversation, but in his nervous anxiety, endeavouring to replace it on the dish with vivacity, sent it roUing across the table to his right-hand neighbour, who quickly perceiving the imminent danger in which he was placed, for- tunately arrested its further progress with his fork. One hearty laugh of the remaining party terminated this scene of confusion. After a short consideration I found, by a most simple rule, and with the greatest facility, that a bird that would take ten minutes to carve very badly may be done well in two or three by the most inexperienced person. From this process a number of advantages may be derived : first, you may eat your dinner much hotter ; secondly, you can make eight or ten pieces of a fowl, or any other bird, where, previously, great difficulty was experienced in making five or six ; and each person will thereby be enabled to choose a favorite piece; a large bird, such as turkey, poularde, capon, &c., will be fit to reappear on your table in a very inviting state. I must dso observe that the birds are not in the least disfigured, but, on the contrary, their appearance is much improved. BIKECTIONS FOR CARVING. By the smiple process which I have efi"ected for the jointing of game or small poultry, with a long pointed pair of scissors, separating the smews which jom the wings to the breast, making the incision as small as possible, and also jointing the legs, by passing your finger between the skm and the flesh, pressing the legs over the breast with the left hand, the separation of the joints may be easily effected and having thus detached the four principal parts, the carving, when roasted, wUl be very simple.

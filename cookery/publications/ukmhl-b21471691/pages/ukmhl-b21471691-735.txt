For a brown sauce I use the same proportion as for the white, but having beef instead of veal for the stock, which must be made brown by placing four large onions cut in halves at the bottom of the stewpan, which niust be well buttered, placing the meat over, standing upon the fire, and drawing down to a brown glaze before filling up, the thickening must also be made brown, by stu-ring a few minutes longer over the fire, and the milk omitted. Some- times I make both stocks in the same stewpan, pass one half for the white sauce, and put a couple of burnt onions into the remainder, allowing it to simmer an hour longer, when pass and use for a brown sauce. No. 137. Melted Butter. Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, with which mix a good teaspoonful of flour, using a wooden spoon, add a saltspoonfid of salt, half a one of pepper, a little grated nutmeg, and half a pint of water, stir over the flre until just upon the point of boihng, when take ofi", add two ounces more butter, and half a tablespooiiful of vinegar, keeping it stiiTed until quite smooth, and the butter well melted, when pass through a hair sieve or tammie if required (you can also use mUk instead of water for the above), it is then ready for use; in making melted butter great attention ought to be paid to the above directions, it being almost in daily use. No. 138. New and Economical Lobster Sauce. Break up a fi'csh lobster, use the soHd flesh for salad or any other purpose, pound the soft part and shell together (in a mortar) very fine, place the whole in a stewpan, cover with a pint of boiling water, place over the fire, and let simmer ten minutes, when pass the liquor through a hair sieve into a basin, and use for making melted butter as in the last, to which add a little cayenne pepper and a piece of anchovy butter (see page 31) the size of a walnut; if any red spawn in the lobster, pound and mix it with a small piece of fresh butter, and add to the sauce with a Uttle lemon-juice when upon the point of serving; an anchovy pounded with the shells of the lobster would be an improvement' some of the flesh may be served in the sauce. No. 139. Lobster Sauce a la Creme. Cut up a small lobster into slices, the size of half-crown pieces, put into a stewpan, pound the soft and white part with an ounce of butter, and rub it through a sieve; pour three spoonfuls of melted butter, and two of cream, over the slices in the stew- 43

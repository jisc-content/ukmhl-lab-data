XXV LARDING. DIRECTIONS FOR LARDING. My motive for introducing-the directions for larding at the com- mencement of this work, is to give it the importance which it deserves, it having in all former works heen generally omitted, or lost amongst a multitude of receipts, which has made me desirous of placing it in a conspicuous place, in the hope that many families in the middle classes of society may be able to partake of that very inexpensive luxury. Nothing but experience and practice would enable a person to lard well, I have, therefore, given the few following directions, so that a person might improve hiniself after once commencing. I have been induced to do so from the fact of having had many female cooks with me for improvement, many of whom could send up very good dinners, but few of them have scarcely known, or had any idea of larding, being in the habit of having it done by their poulterer whilst in London, and in the country avoiding it entirely: I shall, therefore, endeavour to explain, first, the choice of the bacon ; secondly, the manner of cutting it; and lastly, the best mode of larding. Choose the firmest bacon you can obtain, quite fat, and not at all red, or it would break and cause a deal of trouble. To cut it, take olF the piece of lean at the bottom, lay it upon a board with the rind upwards, and beat gently with a cutlet-bat, trim the sides, and cut it into bands the breadth that you may requu'e your lardons in length ; if for a fillet of beef, two inches; for fricandeau, turkey, poularde, fowl, pheasant, or sweetbread, an inch and a half; and for lamb's sweatbreads much smaller. Take one of the b^nds, place it before you with the rind downwards, and with a sharp knife cut it in slices, (but not separating it from the rind), of the thickness you require for the article you are about to lard, then place your hand at the top, press lightly, and draw your knife straight along as if cutting the bacon in slices, so as to form the lardons square at each end, com- mencing cutting from the heel of the knife, and finishing at the point. To lard, the French method is so famiUar to me that I cannot but recommend it, especially to inexperienced hands. If a fricandeau, lay it lengthwise upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at, having previously taken all the skin from the veal with a knife, then with the point of your larding-needle make three distinct lines across, half an inch apart, run your needle into the third line (at the further side of the fricandeau), and bring it out at the first, placmg one of the lardons in it, draw the needle through, leaving out a quarter of an inch of the end of the bacon at each line : proceed thus to the end of the row; then make another line half an inch distant, stick m another row of lardons, bringing them out at the second line, leavmg the ends of the bacon out aU of the same length; make the next row again at the same distance, bringing the ends out between the lardons of the first row, proceeding in like manner until you have larded the whole surface in chequered rows : proceed in a similar way with everything you lard, the difierence being only in the size of the lardons, and in the case of poultry or game, previously scald the breasts. By foUowing closely the above simple directions any cook may be able, t not to lard well, at any rate to lard weU enough for every-day use â€¢eouterunl.^''' practice, and likewise competence, to lard aJticle^ lequirecl upon more particular occasions.

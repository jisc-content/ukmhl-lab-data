16 carefully took oft' the portrait ew carton in his hands to admire it; and after showing it to several of his suite, he alFectlonately placed it in his bosom near his heart, with the inten- tion of never parting with it again. But what was his astonishment, on looking at the spot where the former portrait had been deposited, at seeing in the cream, us under a glass, the portrait of himself, as highly finished, and as striking a likeness as any miniature painter could have produced, and surrounded by a gilt-like frame! Monsieur Soyer, having been sent for by the party, was higl^ly complimented by his Highness through his interpreter, who desired to know where and how he could procure such a likeness of his father, and how was his own so correctly drawn in the cream? 'Please tell his Highness,' said Monsieur Soyer to the interpreter, ' that both were executed from the original sketches drawn by our celebrated artist Horace Vernet, whilst in Alexandria. The portrait in the cream is drawn on wafer-paper, which, placed on the damp jelly, representing the glass, dissolves, and nothing remains but the appearance of the portrait drawn in light water- colours. The imitation of the gilt frame is made with^ eau de vie of Dantzic, and gold water mixed with jelly, the gold leaf of which forms tha^lrame. After having been thanked by the Pacha, the pyramidal cream of Egypt was ortoed to be shown to each guest, by sliding it from one to the other round the table (which was more than 250 feet), to the great satisfaction and admiration of every one present. Though everything was eatable in it, this magnificent dish was respected, and remained untouched, but every one tried to partake of the fruit which surrounded this extraordinary and appropriate culinary wonder." The above is given chiefly for the benefit of our Paris contemporaries, who do us the honour to mention that " le Globe nous fait connaitre les eti-anges discours qu'ils ont, I'un at Vautre (Lord Palmerston and Sir C. Napier), 9-eczfc'« a cette occasion.'' Waiving the question whether there was anything " strange" in either speech we beg our Paris con- temporaries to observe that their compatriot, Monsieur Soyer had effected a most skilful diversion from all delicate topics whatsoever. " Segnitus irritant animos demissa per aures Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus.'' Ibrahim Pacha's interpreter, it now appears, had other things to do than to interpret either political retrospects or prospects, as touched by the several speakers. And surely it mieht soften the hearts of our jealous friends about the Palais Royal, to see how large a part of the triumph of the day was, in fact, a French triumph Would we could stop here But truth compels us to say that our ally. Monsieur Soyer, forces us, m the sequel, to teel strange doubts of his thorough devotion to English interests. "The next dish which much amused his Highness was the one entitled ihs Oateaii Britannioue d I'Amiral, being the representation of an old man-of-war, bearing the English and E-yptian flag drawn on rice-paper, the ship being filled with ice mousseuse aux peclies, and loaded with large strawberries, cherries, grapes, and bunches of currants, being so placed on the table that the brave and gallant Commodore Napier had to help from this cargo the mustrious stranger, who did not cease smiling. During that process the moisture and lir Jthe cef which gradually melted, saturated the hull of the vessel, which was made of a kind of delicate sponge cake. Whilst the gallant commodore was m the act of helping the remains of the ice, the%hip gave way, and formed a complete wreck, which caused great hilarity among the company who were close enough to witness the scene » ThP mW mi<rht form a most fertile text for sinister inlerences, if we possessed the The above mi nt lor Paris contemporaries.

DESCRIPTION OP THE KITCHEN OF THE REFORM CLUB AND SIMPLK GUIDE FOR FITTING UP THE KITCHENS OF THE WEALTHY, INTRODUCTION. The unexpected success my new plan has met with for the building of kitchens since the opening of the Reform Club, 'induced me a few years ago to pubhsh a sectional plan of it on a large scale, which I am happy to say was very successful, and met with the approbation of all scientific men, and of the higher classes of society, having received instructions since that time to contrive and arrange nu- merous noblemen's and gentlemen's kitchens, by adapting many of my new and simple discoveries to any shaped kitchen with the greatest facihties, at a very moderate ex- pense ; I therefore beg to present my readers with the re- duced scale of the plan, as well as the correct measurement and size of all the apparatus. I have not the slightest hesi- tation in stating that, by the simple arrangements which I am about to submit, any kitchen, large or small, would be easily benefited and improved; it may also be always kept clean without much labour, the work more carefully done, and the appetite (my intimate fiiend) wiH become the keener. My motto has always been " cleanHness is the soul of the kitchen."

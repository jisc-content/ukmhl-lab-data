APPENDIX. 501 the compass you have it in ; if done it will feel firm to the touch, but the surest method is to run a thin wooden skewer into the centre, if it comes out clean the cake is done, but if not some of the mixture would adhere to it; cai-e should be taken not to disturb it until quite set, or it would sink in the centre, and never properly bake; when done tm-n it out upon a sieve to cool. As the above is for cutting, and many of my new removes are made from it, it had better be overdone than not done enough. No. 1370. Savoy Cahe in mould. Have ready a large high mould hghtly buttered, (with a soft brush, and clarified butter,) turn the mould up to drain, and when the butter is quite set thi'ow some finely sifted sugar mto it; move the mould round until the sugar has adhered to every part, after which turn out the superfluous sugar, tie a band of buttered paper round at the top, and place it in a cool place until the mixtm*e is ready. Place the yolks of fourteen eggs in a basin with one pound of sugar (upon which you have rubbed the rind of two lemons previous to pounding), beat weU together with a wooden spoon until nearly white, then whip the whites of the eggs very stifi", add them to the yollis and sugar, with six ounces of flour and six ounces of potato- flom', mix the whole lightly, but well together, and fill the mould rather more than three parts fuU, place it in a very moderate oven one hour, keeping the oven door shut; then try when done as directed in the last, if done take ofi" the paper and turn it out upon a sieve until quite cold. The above mixture being more dehcate than the last, would not do so well for removes, but may be used for that pm-pose by being made three or four days before it is required.

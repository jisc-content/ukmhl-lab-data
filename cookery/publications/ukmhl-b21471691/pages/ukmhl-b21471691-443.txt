393 OF THE ROASTS FOU SECOND COURSE, In London the poultry and game are sent in so nicely prepared for cooking that any remark upon the method of killing, plucking, and di^awing them would appear almost unnecessary, but remembering the manner that I have seen poultry and game mutilated in some parts of the country, I have been induced to give the following simple directions. The best way of killing poultry is to take the bird by the neck, placing the thmnb of the right hand just at the back of the head, closing the head in your hand, your left hand holding the bu-d, then press yom- thumb down hard and pull the head and neck contrariwise, the neck will break instantaneously, and the bkd will be quite dead in a few seconds, when hang it a short time by the legs for the blood to flow into the head, which renders the flesh much whiter. In France we usually kill them by cutting the throat close to the head; both methods are good with regard to the whiteness of the flesh, but I prefer the Eng- hsh method, not being so barbarous. To pluck either game or poultry have the bird upon a board vsdth its head towards you, and pull the feathers away from you, which is the direction they lay in ; many persons puU out the feathers in a contrajy direction, by which means they are likely to tear the skin to pieces, which would very much disfigure the bird for the table. To draw poultry after it is well plucked, cut a long inci- sion at the back of the neck, cut the neck bone ofi" close to the body of the bird, but leave the skin a good length over.

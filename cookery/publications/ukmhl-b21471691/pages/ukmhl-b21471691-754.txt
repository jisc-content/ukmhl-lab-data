No. 206. Hashed Pheasant. From the remains of a pheasant, previ- ously served, make a hash in the following manner : cut it up into smaUish pieces and put them into a stewpan, with a little flour, half a glass of port wine, a little pepper, salt, and a bay-leaf, and sufficient broth (or water with a piece of glaze in it) to moisten it; let simmer very gently five minutes, take out the pieces, dress them upon your dish, pass the sauce through a hair sieve over, and serve. No. 207. A Plain Salmi of Pheasants, Cut off and trun well the best pieces remaining of pheasants, previously served, and put them into a stew- pan ; then in another stewpan put the bones and trimmings (broken up small), with an onion in slices, a little parsley, a bay-leaf, four peppercorns, and a glass of sherry, boil a few minutes ; then stir in a tablespoonful of fiour, and moisten by degrees with a pint of broth (or water with a piece of glaze), boil about ten minutes, keeping it stirred; when thick enough to adliere to the back of the spoon, pass through a tammie or fine sieve into the other stew- pan over the pieces of pheasants, warm altogether gently, not allowing it to boU, colour a little brown with half a spoonful of colouring (page 673), take out the pieces, dress in pyramid, sauce over, and serve with scippets of fried or toasted bread, cut in the shape of hearts, round. The remains of pheasants may be minced and served with eggs boiled five minutes, and the shells taken off, or made into boudins or croquettes as di- rected for turkey (page 687), as may any other description of game.

Plain roast the grouse, dress them upon toast on your dish, and serve with plain melted butter poured over them; they may also be dressed in any of the waj's directed for phea- sants, with the exception of being stewed with the cabbage; black game is dressed precisely the same as the grouse.

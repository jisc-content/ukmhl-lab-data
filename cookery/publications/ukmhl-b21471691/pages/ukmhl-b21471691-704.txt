KITCHEN AT HOME. 64:2 have not yet forgotten your seven hours dressing of a leg of mutton, (page 193), so if you are not above receiving a lesson I wiE give you one which will enable you to dress this all-imp or tant dish to perfection, for I prize it as I do my own roast beef of Old England, and you must be aware that after the centu- ries of practice I have had that I must understand some little about it. Well, in the first place the quaUty of the meat has a great deal to do with it, of which you have given a fair description, I therefore pass it over, but to proceed : it must be cut pretty freely from the knuckle and placed in a brine- tub, cover well with salt, rub it well in, leave it until the next day, when again rub it with the salt and brine created by the gravy from the meat, rubbing weU every other day until it has remained a fortnight, that is if of a good size, weighing from thirty to thirty-five pounds, if larger or smaller more or less time, which must be left to your own good judgment, then take it out of the pickle, let drain twenty minutes, take out and form it of a good shape, folding the fat round, which fix with skewers, tieing it round with a few yards of very wide tape, tie it up in a thin cloth and place it in a large stock pot with plenty of cold water, set upon a good fire and when beginning to boil draw it to the corner, where let simmer five hours, but two hours before it is done put in eight fine carrots, scraped and cut into six or eight pieces, twelve turnips (peeled) and two suet puddings weighing from two and a half to three pounds each, these articles w^ould, perhaps, cause the water to cease boihng, if so, place it again quite over the fire until it does boil; when done take out the round, let drain ten minutes, take it from the cloth, detach the tape, take out the skewers, replacing them as you take them out with long silver skewers, dress upon a large hot water dish, and pour over about a quart of the liquor it was boiled in, cut a large slice from the top about two inches and a half in thickness, dress the carrots and turnips taste- fully around and serve, with the puddings upon a separate dish, sending one after the other, they will eat much lighter. When upon the table it must be carved with a regular round of beef knife (very sharp) in sUces not exceeding the thickness of half-a-crown piece, assisting each guest to a shce, also give one-third fat, with a Httle of the carrot and turnip, but never dig the underdone part from the centre to obUge any one, for they that cannot eat from a joint well cooked and fairly carved are not worthy of having one set before them. Some persons like them salted to cut red quite through, I do not admire it, but it is done by adding two ounces of salt prunell and half a pound of saltpetre to every fifteen pounds of salt used in the pickling. When a round of beef is very large some persons place a tin tube in the centre to boil it, I do not think it a badplan, as it causes it to cookmoreregular." After receiving the above useful lesson, and being desirous of improving my profession in all its branches, I remembered that amongst the number of joints boiled to serve cold for large civic, agricultural, or benevolent anni- versary dinners, the round of beef was the most prominent, and having seen it standing in dishes to get cold, with the dish filled with the gravy that runs from it, particularly if a Uttle over done, caused me to hit upon the following expedient to prevent the meat losing so much of its succulence: fill two large tubs with cold water, into which throw a few pounds of rough ice, and when the round is done throw it cloth and all into one of the tubs of ice water, let remain one minute, when take out and put it into the other tub, fiU the first tub again with water, and continue the above process for about twenty minutes, then set it upon a dish, leaving the cloth on until the next day, or until quite cold; when opened the fat wiU be as

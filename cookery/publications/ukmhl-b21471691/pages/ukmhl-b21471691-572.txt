IfiNTREMETS. 520 No. 1230. Bordure de Poires en geUe, Cut twelve middling-sized ripe pears in halves, take out tlic cores peel neatly, and throw them into a preserving- pan, with the juice of two lemons and half a pound of lump sugar, let stew rather quickly till tender, but not to break, put them upon a dish till cold, have a cylinder mould (but not too deep) upon the ice, have a quart of jelly flavoured with fom- glasses of any liquor, put a httle at the bottom of the mould half an inch in depth when set, dress your pears round in a border, (but the reverse way, so that they become right when the mould is turned over,) fill the mould up vsdth the jelly when quite cold and upon the point of setting, and when wanted turn it out as before, and fill up the centre with red whipped jelly. Apricots or peaches cut in halves may be dressed the same, or apples. No. 1231. GeUe au Bhum. Have a quart of jelly clarified as before, to which add four wineglasses of old Jamaica rum, colour a Httle with some essence of cochineal, pour it into your mould vsdthout any fruit. This is better appreciated by a party of gentlemen, and should not be introduced where there are ladies; by keeping the jelly a httle stiffer you may introduce more rum. No. 1232. GeUe Mousseuse a VEau de Vie. Put a pint and a half of jelly in a stewpan upon the ice, add fom- glasses of cognac brandy, whip it until very hght and upon the point of setting, when pour in yom- mould, it will be quite white ; when ready to serve turn it out as before directed. If wanted clear, proceed as for gelee au rhum.

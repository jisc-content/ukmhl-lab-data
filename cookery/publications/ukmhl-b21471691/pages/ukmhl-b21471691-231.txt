No. 455. Breast of Veal. I do not consider that a breast of veal is good without the tendron (which is usually cut out and braised for en- trees), yet it would be impossible to roast it with the breast, for it would not be a quarter done by the time the other was; I therefore recommend the following new method: cut out the tendi-on, braise it as described (No. 685), let it get cold, take the other bones out of the breast, lay some forcemeat of veal (No. 120) down the centre, upon which place the tendron, roll it up, sew it with string and your trussing-needle, oil some paper, tie the veal up in it, and roast it two hours, place a sauce Soubise (No. 47); or jar- diniere (No. 100) on the dish; take the veal from the paper and lay it upon the sauce, or if preferred you may serve with a plain veal sauce made thus : put ten spoonfuls of brown sauce, and the same quantity of melted butter into a stewpan, place it on the fue, let it boil ten minutes, skim it, add three tablespoonfuls of Harvey sauce, and it is ready to serve. No. 456. Breast of Veal auxpois fins a VAnglaise. Dress the veal exactly as before, have ready boiled a a quart of fresh young peas, put them into a stewpan, with eight spoonfuls of brown sauce (No. 1), a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and a small bunch of parsley, boil them ten minutes, season with a little salt if required, pour them into your dish, glaze the veal and serve it upon them.

The whole contrivance of this table is much more convenient than might be imagined, by the number of useful objects a common table is deprived of; I certainly could have had a table of large dimensions* upon which great dinners might be laid out, as is commonly done, but that was precisely what I wished to avoid, finding it much more to the purpose, as soon as entree dishes are ready, to put them quickly into a warm place untU wanted to be taken up, which is done with regularity; every dish being num- bered is placed upon the table without confusion, and to all appearance as if the whole had just been dressed, an advantage seldom if ever at the disposal of any chef de cuisine, who generally finds it very difficult to dispose of dishes in a fitting place to keep them in such a proper degree of heat as I obtain with the steam closet.

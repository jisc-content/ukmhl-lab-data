A long brown earthen pan for the above purpose may be obtamed at any china warehouse, but it you cannot obtain one, a stewpan must supply the place. Another method. Have ready six pounds of rump of beef cut into pieces two mches square, lard each piece through with two or three lardons of bacon; have also two pounds of streaked bacon, clear it from the skm, and cut it 'into squares half the size of the beef, put them into an earthen pan Avith two calf's feet (cut up), half a pint of sherry, two bay-leaves, a sprig of thyme, a bunch of parsley, four onions, with a clove in each, a blade of mace, and half a pint of water, cover the pan as in the last, and put it in a moderate oven for three hours; do not open the pan until three parts cold, then take out the meat, lay a little of the beef at the bottom of a stewpan (not too large), then a little of the bacon, then more beef, and so on alternately, press them together hghtly, then pass the gravy through a haii- sieve over, and leave it until quite cold, then dip the stewpan into hot water, and turn out upon your dish to serve ; the calf's feet may be made hot in a Uttle of the stock, to which add two pats of butter, with which you have mixed a teaspoonful of flour, a httle chopped parsley, and half a spoonful of vinegar, and serve as an entree. The above is excellent either hot or cold. No. 101. Ox-tongue.

55 Health and Contentment. The simplicity of the following ode, beautifully illus- trates the general force of contentment: mm £3: No glo-ry I co-vet, no riches I want, am - bition is nothing to s: me; m The one thing I beg of kind Hea - ven to grant, is a E mind in - de - pendant C V" and 1 free. Qip-f r 4K- &=p—1 With passion unruffled, untainted with pride, By reason my life let me square ; The wants of my nature are cheaply supply'd, And the rest is but folly and care. The blessings which Providence freely has lent, I'll justly and gratefully prize ; Whilst sweet meditation and cheerful content Shall make me both healthy and wise. In the pleasures the great man's possessions display, Unenvy'd I'll challenge my part; For ev'ry fair object my eyes can survey, Contributes to gladden my heart. How vainly, thro* infinite trouble and strife, The many their labours employ ! Since all that is truly delightful in life, Is what all, if they will, may enjoy. Hence then a calm, contented, and cheerful disposi- tion, may justly be considered the great source of health, as regards body or mind ; and ought, as a God-like attri- bute, to be esteemed as the most important and valuable of all our earthly possessions.

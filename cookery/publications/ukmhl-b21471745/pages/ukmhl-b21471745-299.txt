The loss of roasting arises from the melting out of the fat, and evaporating the water; but the nutritious mat- ters remain condensed in the cooked solid. In boiling, the loss arises partly from the fat melted out, but chiefly from gelatine and osmazome being ex- tracted and dissolved by the water in which the meat it boiled; there is, therefore, a real loss of nourishment, unless the broth be used; when this mode of cooking becomes the most economical.

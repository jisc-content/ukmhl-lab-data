In all ages, physicians have generally contrived to get large fees. Thus Eristratus, the physician, got a handsome fee, no less than sixty thousand crowns, from Seleucus, for having discovered his son's (Antiochus) disorder, and prescribing a remedy, though to the father a very unpleasant one. Love was the young man's com- plaint, and love of Stratonice, his father's favourite con- cubine, who being handed over, like landed property, from father to son, adjusted matters, and cured the young gentleman. We find also, that Petrus Aponensis, or, as some call him, Pierre D'Avane, a physician of Padua, in the thirteenth century, would not go out of town on a visit to the sick, under one hundred and fifty francs a day. When sent for to Pope Honorius IV. he demanded four hundred ducats a day.

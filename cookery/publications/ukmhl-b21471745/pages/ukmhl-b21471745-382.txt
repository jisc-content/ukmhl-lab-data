3GG On the Physical Education of Children, fyc. upon our existence, must also participate in the unhappy issue. Although I by no means wish to insinuate, that the feelings of parents ought, on such occasions, to be sup- pressed ; or that the peculiar pleasure they experience in beholding their beloved offspring ought to be checked, I shall nevertheless recommend the excellent advice of Epictetus; because I am convinced, that it is unreason- able to indulge in violent sorrow, and to make no efforts to controul the emotions and passions oi" a susceptible breast, when their influence, on both mind and body, may be attended with dangerous effects.

This barbarous custom was adopted from the following plausible motives: first, be- cause they imagined they should render an essential ser- vice to the Republic, by destroying such children as were not likely to defend her against the enemy, or to pro-

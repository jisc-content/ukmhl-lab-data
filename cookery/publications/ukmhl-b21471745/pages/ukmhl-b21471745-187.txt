Directions in the Choice of Spectacles. 165 This is the more easily explained by the camera ob- scura, which is a contrivance to exhibit the representation Qf such objects as may be seen irons a window, upon a plain white surface held before the window within the room. For this purpose, a convex lens must be fixed in a hole in the window shutter; and then, if no light be suffered to enter the room but what passes through the hole, and a sheet of white paper is held opposite to the hole, at such a distance that the rays proceeding from the object abroad, and passing through the glass, may be collected into their respective foci, we have the images of all the objects which lay before the hole, re- presented upon the paper, inverted, but in a much more lively and exact manner than can be done even by the pencil; and not only the objects, and their situation, but, what is peculiar to this sort of painting, their motion, will also be expressed. Directions to be observed in the Choice of Spectacles.— When Spectacles are necessary, $c. Those spectacles are best, which are the least convex of any that will suit the eye. For as they cannot be put close to the eye, the pictures of objects upon the retina are less magnified; they also oblige the eye to that con- formation of its coats and humours, which is requisite for seeing objects as near as it can, and, consequently, may prevent the eye from growing more and more long- sighted; for when the picture upon the retina is very large, it need not be quite so distinct as when it is smaller, to convey an idea of the same number of parts of an object; consequently, the eye will be more at liberty to recede from that conformation which is proper for the glass, and to relapse into that to which it inclines, and which is only proper for seeing more remote objects. —Hence, then, Spectacles are necessary, 1. When we are to remove small objects to an increased distance from the eye (the general indication of the decay of sight), to see them distinctly: 2. When we find it necessary to have more light than formerly; as, for instance, when we find ourselves placing the candle between the eye and the object: 3. When, on looking at, and attentively considering a near object, it becomes confused, and appears to have a kind of mist before it:

413 Extract'from Pepys* Memoirs. CHAB.MES. 1. For stenching Blood. Sanguis mane in te Sicut Christus fuit in se, Sanguis mane in tua vena, Sicut Christus in sua poena; Sanguis mane fixus, Sicut Christus, quando fuit crucifixus. In English, literally thus: Blood, remain in thyself, as Christ was in himself; blood remain in thy vein, as Christ did under his pain; blood, remain fixed, as Christ when he was crucified. 2. A Thorn. Jesus, that was of Virgin born, Was pricked both with nail and thorn ; If neither wealed, nor belled, rankled nor boned ; In the name of Jesus, no more shall this. Or thus— Christ was of a Virgin born, And he was pricked with a thorn ; And it did neither bell nor swell: And I trust in Jesus this never will. 3. A Cramp. Cramp, be thou famtless As our lady was sinless, When she bare Jesus. 4. A Burning. There came three Angells out of the East; The one brought fire, the other brought frost— Out fire ; in frost. In the name of the Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen." Of a peice with these charms, is a notice of the cele- brated Sir William Petty: " Sir William did tell me, that in good earnest he hath in his will left some parts of his estate to him that could invent such and such things. As among others, that could discover truly the way of milk coming into the breasts of women; and he that could invent proper characters to express to another, the mixture of relishes and tastes. And says, that to him that invents gold, he gives nothing, for the philosophers' stone; for (says he) they that find out that, will be able to pay themselves. But, says he, by this means it is better than to go to a lecture; for here my executors, that must part with this, will be sure to be well convinced of the invention before they do part with their money."

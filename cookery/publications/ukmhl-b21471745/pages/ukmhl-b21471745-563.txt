Of the Crying of Children. 545 sequently, at this early age, the whole mass of the fluids is gradually corrupted. If, however, the mother or nurse has no recourse to the administration of aliment, they at least remove the child from its couch, carry it about, frequently in the middle of the night, and thus expose it to repeated colds, which are in their efiects infinitely more dangerous than the most violent cries. Others will be so much alarmed as to call in medical assistance; and as a physician or surgeon would be thought a very igno- rant or unfeeling man, if he should prescribe no remedy, even though the cause Of the complaint remain obscure, we may easily imagine the mischievous consequences thence resulting. Let us even suppose, that none of these expedients be adopted, it will be found that in- fants very soon become sensible of the anxious attention paid to their cries, especially when they perceive that things are given to them with a view to satisfy their claims: by such imprudent management, the foundation is laid for a troublesome and obstinate temper; while their habitual complaints, so far from abating, daily in- crease. Professor^ Hufeland has uniformly remarked, that those infants whose cries were anxiously attended to, became the most violent; as, on the contrary, those who were treated with apparent indifference, soon re- linquished this unpleasant custom: in short, it cannot be denied, that too anxious and rigid an attention bestowed on those little darlings, is the most certain way of ener- vating their mind and body. We learn indeed from daily experience, that children who have been the least indulged, thrive much better, unfold all their faculties quicker, and acquire more muscular strength and vigour of mind, than those who have been constantly favoured, and treated by their parents with the most solicitous attention : bodily weak- ness and mental imbecility are the usual attributes of the latter. The first and principal rule of education ought never to be forgotten ; that man is intended to be a free and independent agent; that his moral and physical powers ought to be spontaneously developed ; and that he should as soon as possible be made acquainted with the nature and uses of all his faculties, in order to attain that degree of perfection which is consistent with the structure of his organs; and that he is not originally designed for what we endeavour to make of him by artificial aid. Hence the greatest art in educating children, consists in the conti- 3 z 2

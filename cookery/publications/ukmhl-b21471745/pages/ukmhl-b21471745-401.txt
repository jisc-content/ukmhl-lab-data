Quick-lime, one ounce; orpiment, half an ounce; distilled water, half a pint: dissolve and filter. 2.

A few drops of this liquor, added to any kind of wine, precipi- tates any metal besides iron, that may be contained in it, which it is prevented from doing by the addition of the spirit of salt. 3. Saturate water with sulphuret of hydrogen acid; acidulate it with muriatic acid. 4. Add a little muriatic acid to the wine, and then pass sulphurated hydrogen through. ESSENCE OF ANCHOVIES.

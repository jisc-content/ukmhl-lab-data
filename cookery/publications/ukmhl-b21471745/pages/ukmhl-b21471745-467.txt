/ Antidotes to Venomous Bites. 449 The second indication is that of applying topical reme* dies to the wound, either by the application of one's own mouth, or that of an assistant, for the purpose of with- drawing by strong suction as much of the poison from the wound as can be effected, and which will do no injury, either to the mouth or stomach of the person if swallowed; after which eau de luce, nitric or sulphuric acid, water of ammonia, or sal volatile, should be dropped into the wound as freely as possible, and the recess washed as completely out with it as can be accomplished. The practical and beneficial effects of the application of ligatures and suction, is amply exemplified in the case of a soldier who was bit by a snake at Sydney, in New South Wales, which has appeared since writing the above, in the papers of India, and which is here extracted, to illustrate the subject:— Sydney, March 22.—From a person on whose veracity we place the greatest reliance, we learn that a month ago a private of the Royal Veteran Company was bit by a snake in a pasturage adjoining Liverpool, where he was quartered. Struck with instant horror, and the certainty of a speedy dissolution, the sufferer fell instantly into a state of hopelessness and almost stupor; his body began to swell in a few minutes, and the first of his com- rades who visited him, gave him over as lost. In the barrack there happened at the time to be an old native man, who immediately repaired to his assistance. From a bark he stripped a few shreds, and combining them into a strong ligature, applied it a little above the affected part, the bite being a little above the ancle.—He applied the ligature with such excessive strictness, that the patient supposed his leg had been taken off. This done, the native proceeded in rubbing the leg downwards with no less violence for some minutes, and then taking away with a knife, only as much of the skin as the punctures were apparent on, he applied his lips to the wounded part, .and took away by suction a quantity of coagulated matter; then pronounced the cure, desiring the regenerated patient to go to his barrack, and keep himself quiet. It proved effectual, for the man now lives: and, in gratitude to his black physician, gave him all he was possessed of, being to the value of about 51. sterling. The third indication is to be effected by exhibiting internally a tea-spoonful of eau de luce, water of ammo- nia, or sal volatile, in half a glass of cold water, every 3 L 2

INTRODUCTION. xvi people may be enabled occasionally to manage their own gardens, or to give directions for its cultivation in the several branches above enumerated.—Under Rural Economy, will be found some excellent instructions on the cultivation of various articles in constant requisition —manures, draining, fruit-trees, orcharding, destruction of insects, diseases of trees, remedies, hay-making, eco- nomy of bees, care of sheep, instructions for sowing and cultivating tobacco in England, method of increasing potatoes, flooding of meadows, preservation of game, &c. &c. being selections from the opinions of the best practical writers on these matters. MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES USED IN THE MANUFACTURES, DOMESTIC ARTS, &c. have also claimed a portion of our consideration. Among these will be found directions for the making and pre- paring various kinds of cements, varnishes, colours, and other articles used in dying, polishing, lacquering, bronz- ing, staining, vein-marbling, sundry methods of making the best and most durable inks, blacking, boot-top liquid, wash-colour for maps or writings, Blackman's colours in bladders, plate-powder, polishes, &c. &c. In addition to the preceding features, much equally useful matter will be found interspersed throughout the work. Many eligible tables, containing information of general use in domestic concerns, desirable at all times to be acquainted with, relating to the prices of market- goods, at various rates, &c. &c. As the object of the Editor was to form a complete system of general domes- tic economy, neither pains nor expence have been spared in consulting the most popular authors in every depart- ment of useful knowledge; a reference to the following pages, will be the best proof of the zeal and industry by which he has been actuated, in the furtherance of these views.

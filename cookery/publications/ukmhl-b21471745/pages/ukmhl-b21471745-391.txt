On the Physical Education of Children, $c. 375 and to depress the most innocent of human beings, by superstition and tyranny! The Hindoos are the most gentle race of mankind. They intentionally injure nothing that breathes; they respect every thing that has life, and subsist on the most innocent food, such as milk, rice, and the nutritious plants and fruits that their country affords.

Gentle zephyrs fanned the tree, gradually transplanted from the heights of Asia, and breathed life into every part. Time and circumstances assisted in refining its juices, and crowning it with that perfection which still excites universal admiration in the models of Grecian art and wisdom. Here were conceived and exe- cuted, figures which no admirer of Circassian beauty, no Indian or Cashmirian artist could have invented. The human form ascended Olympus, and clothed itself in di- vine beauty.â€”(To be continued),' 3 b

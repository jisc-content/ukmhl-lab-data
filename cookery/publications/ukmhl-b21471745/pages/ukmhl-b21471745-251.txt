On the Means of Destroying Insects in Orchards. 229 On the Means of Destroying Insects in Orchards; confirm- ing the Doctrine in the foregoing Paper. By William Hampson, Esq. (From the same JVork). " It will not appear foreign to the subject, if some general observations which are well known to those who have the management of fruit-trees, and more parti- cularly the apple, precede an account of the means here discovered, for preventing the destruction often occasioned by the ravages of the caterpillars. 1st, A winter, in which there is a severe frost for a long continuance, is accounted favourable to the succeeding fruit harvest. 2dly, Young and healthy trees, which are continually distending the rind, and putting forth vigorous branches, are not often attacked with the caterpillars; or if they are, it is when the foliage of an aged or sickly neighbour is exhausted; and then, being urged by want of food, the worm throws its silken line, which, carried by the wind, clings to the branches of another tree, and by this means it effects a passage. " Some time ago, having an intention to improve a number of apple-trees, which, owing to their being yearly infested with the caterpillar, had been long neglected, I began in the following manner: it being early in the spring, I first caused the thick brown moss to be re- moved from the trunk of the tree, around which, but at a distance equal to the extremities of the roots, I spread warm rotten litter; and then, with the back of a pruning knife, scraped off the livid-coloured moss with which the branches of the tree were entirely encrusted. But what surprised me, and to which I would beg particular atten- tion, was, that small detached pieces of moss hung upon the bough by fine threads, after it had been cleansed: this led me to think they belonged to some eggs or insects which lay concealed between the moss and the outer bark, or between the outer and the inner rind ; but being then without the help of glasses, my curiosity remained unsa- tisfied, although the effects discovered in the opening season justified my strongest apprehensions; for those trees which had been thoroughly cleaned, put forth strong and healthy shoots, and retained their leaves; when others, their neighbours, were eaten up: yet what convinced me beyond the least doubt, was a tree which through negli- gence had been left in part cleaned: the boughs which I

157 Mechanics, Labourers, #c. Instances, in fact, are on record, where a gold-refiner, in gilding some silver plate, was so affected by the mer- curial vapour, that he became stupid, deaf, and dumb; and of another who was struck with a palsy, from impru- dently exposing himself to the vaporisation Of mercury. Another again, of a German, who got his living by gild- ing plate, who, in consequence of managing the steam arising from the mercury with less caution than usual, " fell into a dismal vertigo, with a violent difficulty of breathing, a ghastly countenance, a lowness of pulse, and trembling of the joints, insomuch, that every one thought he was expiring; but was cured after all by sweats, procured with several alexipharmical prescrip- tions, and especially the decoction of the roots of burnet and saxifrage.'* Remarks on the Treatment of these Diseases, fyc. To correct the effects produced by the inhalation of the fumes of mercury, as well as to prevent them from taking place, we have already observed, that avoiding the cause, either wholly or as much as possible, will be found to be the surest means of averting their serious consequences. Poterius, in his Pharmacopoeia Spagy- rica, recommends sublimated sulphur infused in wine. Purgatives are also necessary; as well as antimonials, to promote perspiration. Cordial spirituous waters, or even brandy, or diluted alcohol; decoctions of the blessed thistle, and the like, are reckoned more effectual than the distilled waters. Bleeding would prove injurious, from its sedative effect on the body, which requires rather to be stimulated. We are told by Pliny, that the ancients, in working in the lead and silver mines, used to tie bladders upon their faces, to guard against the effects of these minerals: if, therefore, masks of glass, or other equivalent materials, could be invented for the same purpose, they might go a great length in arresting the ravages committed upon that portion of the human race destined to labour among these deleterious products of nature, until such employments be rendered more safe by means of an apparatus calcu- lated effectually to destroy or obviate the noxious fumes as they arise.â€”(To be continued).

211 PRACTICAL REMARKS ON THE DISEASES OF TRADES- MEN, MECHANICS, LABOURERS, &c. &c. (Continue<l from page 157). Symptoms of the Dry Belly-ache, or Devonshire Colicâ€” Colic occasioned by the Fumes of Lead, Paint, fyc.

There is sometimes, though not always, considerable retching; and when vomiting takes place in this disease, what is thrown up is usually of a green colour.

When this colic has continued for some time, and occa- sionally when it has not been present, there results a peculiar species of palsy, which affects the superior extremities only, very rarely the inferior. The wrist also in many cases becomes remarkably flaccid and loose, as if the weight of the hand stretched the capsular ligament of it. The thumb wastes away, in consequence, it is supposed, of the rapid absorption of the part taking place from the pressure of the handle of the brush used in painting. This disease is always attended with some degree of danger, in proportion to the violence of the symptoms and the duration of the disease. Even when it docs not k e 2

By your industry, life's comforts are procured for yourselves and families. If you lose your health, the power of being industrious will forsake you. That you know; but you may not know, that to breathe the fresh and changed air con- stantly, is not less necessary to preserve health, than sobriety itself. Air becomes unwholesome in a few hours, if the windows be shut. Open those of your sleeping rooms whenever you quit them to go to your workshops. Keep the windows of your workshops open, whenever the weather is not; insupportably cold. I nave no interest in giving you this advice. Remember what I, your country- man, and a physician, tell you. If you would not bring infection and disease upon yourselves, and to your wives and little ones, change the air you breathe; change it many times a day, by opening your windows." * A man of genius, a botanist, a poet, a practitioner, and author of Zoonomia.

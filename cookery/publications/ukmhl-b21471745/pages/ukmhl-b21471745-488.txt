470 Observations on the Pulsation of the Heart, #c. soluble; if the secret of rejuvenization be ever discovered, it will be found in the kitchen. Very soon after we pass the Meridian of Life (which, according to those who train men for athletic exercises, and to Dr. Jameson*, is our 28th, and to Dr. Cheyne, about our 35th year), the elasticity of the animal system imperceptibly diminishes, our senses become less sus- ceptible, and are every hour getting the worse for wear, however self-love, assisted by your hair-dresser and tailor, &c. may endeavour to persuade you to the contrary. Digestion and sleep are less perfect—the restorative process more and more fails to keep pace with the con- suming process—the body is insufficiently repaired, more easily deranged, and with more difficulty brought into adjustment again; till at length, the vital power being diminished, and the organs deteriorated, nourishment can neither be received, nor prepared and diffused through the constitution, and consumption so much exceeds re- novation, that decay rapidly closes the scene of life. One may form some idea of the self-consumption of the human body, by reflecting that the pulsation of the heart, and the motion of the blood connected with it, takes place 100,000 times every day; i.e. on an average the pulsef beats 70 times in a minute, multiplied by 60 minutes in an hour, 4200 24 hours in a day, 16800 8400 100800 pulsations in a day. * See his sensible Essay on the Changes of the Human Body at different Ages. 8vo. 1811, p. 89. f "The Pulse in the new-born Infant, while plac"ty\ 140 m a minute sleeping, is about - J Towards the end of the First Year - - - 124 Towards the end of the Second Year - - - 110 Towards the end of the Third and Fourth Years - 96 When the first Teeth drop out - 86 At Puberty ' - - 80 At Manhood 75 At Sixty, about CO" .

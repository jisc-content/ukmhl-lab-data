Optical Remarks, Illustrative and Experimental. It is necessary here to observe, that every eye has its particular focus, or certain fixed point, where, by its re- fracting power, the images of all external objects are fprmed. This is usually formed on that part of the eye called the retina (the third and innermost membrane of the eye, and the true organ of vision); and whenever it happens otherwise, the eye is then said to be defective in the formation of the crystalline humour; and as in some of these the images of objects do not reach the re- tina, which is the case in short-sighted persons—a de- ficiency which is easily supplied by means of concave or Convex glasses. Explanation.—The progress of the rays of light pro- ceeding from an object, is described in the annexed diagram, where ABC represent the eye, and DE the crystalline humour. Suppose fh an object placed before it, emitting pencils of rays from its several points /g h, which rays, by the refracting powers of the humours con- tained in the eye, are made to converge, and meet to- gether in a focus at Z, a point in the retina; by which means, an image of the object h gf, will be found there; although, in consequence of the rays of light crossing each other, it will be inverted. This is proved by ex- periment ; for, if the back part of the eye be cut away, and a paper applied there, the image of external objects placed upon it, will be seen, and very distinctly, pro- vided no light be suffered to fall upon the paper, except that which passes through the humours of the eye.

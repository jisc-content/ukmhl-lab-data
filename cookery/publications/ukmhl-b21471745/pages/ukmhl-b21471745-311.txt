295 DISEASES OF THE SKIN. Anatomical History of the Skin, He. The cutis, or true skin, is formed of the termination of the superficial exhalent arteries, veins, nerves, and absorbents, and is covered by the cuticle or scarf skin. Whatever may be the complexion of the individual, the true skin is always white, and the scarf skin, which has neither blood-vessels or nerves, is itself colourless. Between the true skin and the scarf skin there is a mu- cous substance, called rele mucosum, which gives colour to the body, and on which the complexion of the person entirely depends. In the negro, this substance is black; in the mulatto, of a copper-colour; in theEgyjitian, brown ; and white in the Albinos, and in the people of cold cli- mate's, i The outside covering, or cuticle, is a fine transparent close-set tunic, drawn over the whole surface of the body. The foulness of this tunic is of frequent occurrence, pro- ducing, if not washed, pimples, tetters, and other dis- eases of the skin. This insensible and inorganic medium, (the scarf skin) which has not inaptly been compared to a tight shirt drawn over and fitted to every part of the body, renders the introduction of substances into the system, which are in contact with the body, more difficult; that is, it renders absorption on the surface of the body less energetic than on the surface of internal cavities; hence cutaneous absorption here has so little activity, under certain circumstances, that it has been questioned, whether or not it existed, and various experiments have been made, to prove that the skin has no absorbing power at all. The additional weight, however, of the body, after remaining for.some time in the bath, although denied by Haller—the evident swelling of the inguinal glands after long continued immersion of the feet in warm water (an observation made by Richerand)—the effects of cathartic and vermifuge medicines, externally applied —the effects of mercurial friction, and of.the medicated baths, in a number of cases, are insuperable proofs that, under different circumstances, absorption is effected by the skin. By the structure of the skin, we see that it both secretes and absorbs: that poisons and antidotes have been con- veyed into the system through it, cannot be denied; and p p

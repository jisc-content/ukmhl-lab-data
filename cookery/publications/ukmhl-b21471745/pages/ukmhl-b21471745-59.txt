Singular Cures of the Gout, fyc. 37 physic, was desirous to cure his friend; and when he was in one of his fits, directed two of his domestics to give him fifty-two blows on the soles of his feet. The servants, who were not so learned as their master, asto- nished he should be treated in a manner that had so little the appearance of friendship, imagined the infidel must have given some affront, and executed their orders with a severity, of which they made their boast.â€”" What, (said he) rascals! have you dared to treat the man who is my friend with disrespect?

He required fifteen days to prepare his remedy, which were granted. He demanded that they should send to Czirbaul upon the Occa, two days' journey from Moscow, whence they were to bring him a waggon loaded with all manner of herbs, which he never either saw or knew; of

422 On the Operation of Brushing the Teeth. As the health of the teeth, as well as every part of the body, greatly depends upon the stomach properly per- forming its office, it may not be amiss to observe, that whatever tends to disturb its functions should be avoided, especially spirits, and wine in excess. Costiveness being also highly detrimental to the teeth, the bowels should be kept open by the occasional use of an aperient medicine, which will at the same time promote digestion, remove obstructions in the liver, and purge the system of bile. On the Operation of Brushing the Teeth. A person cleaning his teeth with a coarse mineral tooth- powder and a hard brush, does considerable violence to the gums, especially the edges; indeed so much so, that it is very common to rupture small blood-vessels j in consequence of which, a considerable irritation is pro- duced, and kept up by the daily use of the brush. The edges of the gums inflame and tumefy, and the whole gum becomes spongy j and the hair of the brush spreading in different directions, the gum is separated from the teeth, and thus the source of nourishment of the teeth, and par- ticularly the external part (the enamel), is nearly, if not entirely cut off; in consequence of which the teeth be- come loose, and in time fall out, if disease do not take place in their substance. From the irritated and de- tached gum there is also a morbid secretion, which, col- lecting on the teeth, and becoming of a firm texture, forms what is termed tartar, for the removal of which, the operation of cleaning by the brush, to those unacquainted with the cause, appears to be more necessary; and it frequently happens that many people, at the age of forty, have, by this practice, the substance of their gums so abraded, that the upper part of the fangs of the teeth and aveolar process of the jaw are exposed. Instead, there- fore, of advising people to keep their teeth clean by the mechanical friction of a hard brush, and a coarse mineral powder, we would seriously advise them to attend to the state of the gums; and when the teeth require cleaning (which they will seldom do if they attend to this advice), not to irritate the edges of the gums by the use of a hard brush or a coarse powder.

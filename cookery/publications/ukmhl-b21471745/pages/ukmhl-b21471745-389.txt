On the Physical Education of Children, fyc. 373 they have some remains of the flat visage, the thin beard, and the brown complexion, of the northern climate ; but they are distinguishable by the inner angle of the eye being acute, fleshy, and inclined obliquely to the nose ; by narrow, black, slightly-arched eye-brows; a small flat nose, very broad at the upper part; large prominent ears j the legs and thighs bowed ; and strong white teeth, which, together with the rest of the features, appear to characterize a beast of prey among men. Whence pro- ceeds this form ? Their bow legs originate from their way of life. From their childhood they creep along upon their legs, or cling to the back of ahorse. Their lives are vSpent between sitting and riding; and to the only position that gives the human foot its straight fine form, that of walking, they are almost entire strangers. And may not more of their figure be traced to their way of life ?â€”Have not the prominent brutal ear that is ever listening; the small acute eye that perceives the least dust or smoke at the greatest distance; the white, projecting, bone-gnawing tooth, the thick neck, and the backward reclining position of the head, become substantial features, and charac- teristics of their mode of living ? If we add to this, what Pallas asserts, that their children, even to the age of ten, frequently have deformed and bloated faces, and are of a cachochymic or sickly aspect, till, as they grow up, they become better shaped; if we consider that rain seldom falls on extensive tracts of their country, that they have little water, or at least none that is pure, so that from their infancy they scarcely know what it is to bathe; if we reflect on the salt lakes and marshes, the saline nature of the soil they inhabit, the alkaline savour of which they relish in their food, as well as in the deluges of tea with which they daily enfeeble their digestive faculty; if, farther, we consider the elevation of that country, the thin air, dry winds, alkaline effluvia, and long winters spent in the smoke of their huts, and with snow continually before their eyes; is it not probable, that their figure originated from these causes some thou- sands of years ago, when many of them perhaps operated still more forcibly, and thus insensibly became their hereditary nature ? Nothing invigorates our bodies more, and contributes in a greater degree to their growth and firmness, than washing and bathing in water; particularly if to these be joined walking, running, wrestling, and other bodily exercises. Nothing has a greater tendency

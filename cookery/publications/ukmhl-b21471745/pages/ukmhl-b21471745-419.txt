401 Reflections on Human Life, fyc. Education of Children ought to be adapted to their Indivi- dual Temperament, fyc. Much, indeed, may also be accomplished by a proper method of educating children, if this method be adapted to their individual temperament, bodily constitution, and other concommitant circumstances. But I shall find ample opportunities of shewing in my subsequent Lec- tures, that in general we have not uniformly followed the path of Nature; that we endeavour, as it were, to raise plants which are not destined to live in a hot-house; and that we must necessarily return to that simple and consistent plan of Nature from which, in many instances, we have greatly deviated. A few words, then, will be sufficient to recapitulate, what we have actually gained, or lost, by our modern re- finements in general. The lower orders of the people, especially in large towns, appear to have acquired im- moral habits and relaxed principles, instead of their ancient simplicity of manners, and unshaken integrity; the middle ranks of society are perhaps the greatest gainers, as they are better informed, and have attained more skill in such pursuits as depend upon the combined agency of mental and physical talent; lastly, the higher ranks have become unquestionably more enlightened, with respect to their true interest; but I cannot repress the observation, that they have also become subject to here- ditary diseases unknown to their ancestors; and that the acquisition of mental powers and abilities appears to be in no just proportion to the obvious decrease of phy- sical energy. In short, our attainments in ethics are more extensive, perhaps more systematic; but I hope to be forgiven, when I assert, that the present age appears to labour under a certain mental and corporeal imbeci- lity, scarcely definable by words, but which is evident in that fickle conduct, in that peculiar want of resolution and mental vigour, which marks the actions of the most cultivated minds, and of which we rarely find instances among our less enlightened, but more consistent and de- termined forefathers. Reflections on Human Life, fyc. These, or similar ideas, probably suggested the follow- ing reflections to the pathetic Mr. Herder, whose work has already been mentioned:â€”" The whole career of 3k2

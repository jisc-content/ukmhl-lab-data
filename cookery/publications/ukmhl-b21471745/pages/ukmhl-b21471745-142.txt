On lite Cost of Tea, fa. 120 The beer. according to 4 G. . IV. c. 51, is required ft to be brewed in the proportion of five barrels of thirty-six gallons, and five and a half of such barrels to a quarter of malt;" that is, ninety-nine quarts to a bushel of malt, or a lower strength than that proposed by Mr. Cobbett, in the proportion of ninety-nine to seventy-two. to s s O CI) «_g n **■) ^ £<3 s. 6 8 10 3J 12 4£ 14 5| 16 6 .18 6 J + 14 ox ~ S 8 This is subjected to a duty of 5s. per barrel of thirty-six gallons, payable by a public brewer, equal to an addi- tional duty on malt of 3s. 3|d. per bushel. The third and last description of malt-liquor which I have proposed to bring under this comparison of strength and cost, is that which is adopted very generally in Shrop- shire, both by alehouse-keepers and private brewers, and is considered as good ale, being about eight gallons to a bushel of malt. I might be told that the alehouse-keepers draw only eight gallons of ale from the Oswestry bushel of nine gallons and a half of malt, but they take some small beer after it, which 'allows me to assume the even quan- tity of a gallon of ale from a gallon of malt. A barrel of small beer of thirty-four gallons, is charged with an addi- tional duty of 2s., two or three gallons of which is usually made from every bushel of malt after the ale wort is drawn off.

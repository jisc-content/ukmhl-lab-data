510 ANTHELMINTICS; OR, MEDICINES WHICH PROCURE THE EVACUATION OF WORMS FROM THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. The greater number of these act mechanically, dis- lodging the worms by the sharpness or roughness of their particles, or by their cathartic operation. Some seem to have no other qualities than those of powerful bitters, by which they either prove noxious to these animals, or remove that debility of the digestive organs, by which the food is not properly assimilated, or the secreted fluids poured into the intestines are not properly prepared: circumstances from which it has been supposed the gene- ration of worms may arise. The principal Medicines, with their respective Doses, belong- ing to this class. Dose. Aloes , grs. v. to xv. Asafoetida grs. x. to gss. Camphor grs. v. to 9j. Cabbage bark tree grs. x. to 9iij.

Anthelmintics or vermifuges are usually given on an empty stomach, blended with treacle, &c. Those that do not operate by purging, require the interposition of a cathartic, e. g. the male fern-root, tin filings, the Carolina pink, &c. In administering the last, it is generally pre- mised by an emetic.—New London Medical Pocket Book, p. 22.

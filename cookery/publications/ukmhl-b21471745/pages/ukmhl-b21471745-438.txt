When they are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them; brush them with the yolk of an egg, and then roll them in bread crumbs; spit them on a lark spit, and tie that on to a larger spit ; ten or fifteen minutes at a quick fire will be enough; baste them with fresh butter while they are roasting, and sprinkle them with bread crumbs till they are well covered with them.

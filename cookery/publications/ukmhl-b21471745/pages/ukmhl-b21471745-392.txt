Chalk coloured grey with charcoal: used as a tooth- powder. *#* Charcoal varies in its qualities, according to the wood from which it is prepared : that of the soft woods, as the willow, aller, &c. well burned, is best for crayons, for making gunpowder, and for clarifying liquids; that of the harder woods is used for fuel; or for a support for substances exposed to the flame of a blow-pipe: the char- coal of the chesnut is employed by the smiths in the south of Europe, on account of its slow consumption when not urged by the blast of the bellows; and of the fire deadening immediately upon the blast being stopped. The charcoal of the holly, if the bark be left on, is be- lieved to render iron brittle, when worked by a fire made of it. Charcoal powder is used as a poultice to correct fetid ulcers, as well as a tooth-powder; that of the areca nut is the most fashionable dentifrice, but is no other- wise preferable to any other soft charcoal. liquor opii sedativuS.

Of Food, S)-c. as to allow them their victuals at stated periods of the day ; for it has been observed, that those children which were fed indiscriminately through the whole day, were subject to debility and disease. The stomach should be allowed to recover its tone, and to collect the juices necessary for digestion, before it is supplied with a new portion of food. According to the experience of Profes- sor Hufeland, the following order of giving food to chil- dren has been found the most proper, and conducive to their health :â€”after rising in the morning, suppose about six o'clock, a moderate portion of luke-warm milk, with well-baked bread, which should by no means be new; at nine o'clock, bread with some fruit, or, if fruit be scarce, a small quantity of fresh butter; about twelve o'clock, the dinner, of a sufficient quantity ; between four and five o'clock, some bread with fruit, or, in winter, the jam of plums, as a substitute for fruit, or the inspissated juice of carrots, which is a very wholesome preparation, and an excellent vermifuge. On this occasion, children should be allowed to eat till they are satisfied, without surfeiting themselves, that they may not crave for a heavy supper, which disturbs their rest, and is produc- tive of bad humours: lastly, about seven o'clock they may be permitted a light supper, consisting either of milk, soup, fruit, or boiled vegetables, and the like, but neither meat nor mealy dishes, nor any articles of food which produce flatulency; in short, they ought then to eat but little, and remain awake at least for one hour after it. It has often been contended that bread is hurtful to children; but this applies only to new bread, or such as is not sufficiently baked; for instance, our rolls, muffins, and crumpets, than which nothing can be more hurtful and oppressive. Good wheaten bread is extremely proper during the first years of infancy; but that made of rye, or a mixture of wheat and rye, would be more con- ducive to health after the age of childhood. Among all the different articles of vegetable food, there is, in the opinion of Professor Hufeland, perhaps none more nutritive, in the most concentrated form, than the salep-root. By this domestic remedy he has restored weakly and emaciated children in a few weeks, so that they recovered their former healthful appearance, toge- ther with muscular strength and plumpness; nay, the learned Professor even asserts, that thus he has rescued

View of the Varieties of Secondary Dyspepsia. 299. Appearance of the Tongue, fyc. How far it may be taken . as a Criterion.

Dr. Gregory, in his Theory .and Practice of Physic, has, classed Indigestion under the following head, to which he has added remarks on each variety, which our limits will not admit of extracting. Dr. Gregory's Tabular View of the Varieties of Primary Dyspepsy. " 1. Dyspepsia from occasionally overloading the sto- mach. 2. from habitual over-feeding. 3. from habitual indulgence in spirituous liquors. 4. . from want of air and exercise. 5. ■ from exercise, or longcontinued evacua- tions. 6. ■ from anxiety of mind."

It is unnecessary to say/'observes Dr.Gregory, "that there is no one drug which will fufil the great object of treatment, that of giving tone to the weakened stomach of a dyspeptic patient. This can be obtained only by

Housekeeping and Husbandry. 280 The delicacy and excellence of this elegant and inno- cent relish, depends upon the parsley being minced very fine; put it into a sauce-boat, and mix with it, by de- grees, about half a pint of good melted butter, only do not put much flour to it, as the parsley will add to its thickness: never pour parsley and butter over boiled things, but send it up in a boat.

Used to make gruel, also thin unleavened cakes; and when employed as a poultice, is very resolvent. WHEAT STARCH. This is made from wheat flour, by washing it in sacks in a current of water, which carries off the starch and saccharine substance, and leaves the gluten in the sacks: the water being received in troughs, is left to ferment, which, decomposing the saccharine, renders the starch that is deposited, on standing, very pure and white. This starch is friable, easily pulverized, crimp between the fingers, without smell or taste. Wheat in France yielded almost three-fourths its weight; but in Sweden, not quite half its weight. Its properties are demulcent, and perhaps, astringent; it is used for clysters, in diarrhoea and dysen- tery, &c. COMMON STARCH. This consists of starch mixed with powdered blue, to give a blueish tinge to the linen, which is stiffened with its solution in boiling water: this colour being given to it in opposition to the yellow starch, tinged with saffron or turmeric, formerly employed, but which went out of fashion on the execution of the famous midwife, Mrs. Cellier, who was hanged in a ruff of that colour. It is used as a ce- ment, but unfit for internal use. SEMOLINA. This is wheat flour, granulated while moist, and dried so as to deprive it in part of its solubility in hot water. KISEL. Mix one or two pounds of wheat flour, with a handful of wheat bran, and a little yeast with some water; let it stand in a warm place for a fortnight, when the liquor on the surface is to be skimmed off, and the starch washed with cold water : boil this starch while still moist, with a little cow's milk, put it into moulds to become solid, and eat it with cream, or wine and sugar. RYE STARCH. Floury, greyish white, scarcely crimp, and retains the smell and taste of the grain, which yields about half its weight of starch.

247 SUMMER BATHING; SEA AIR; REFRESHENING BREEZES; COUNTRY EXCURSIONS, Ac. '* From brightening fields of ether fair disclos'd, Child of the Sun, refulgent Summer, comes In pride of youth, and felt thro' Nature's depth : He comes attended by the sultry hours, And ever-fanning breezes, on his way ; While from his ardent look, the turning Spring Averts his blushful face, and earth and skies, All smiling, to his hot dominion leaves."—Thomson. .

The greatest and surest preserver of health, as we have already remarked, under this head, is cleanliness. To this important consideration, the ancients were more at- tentive than the moderns have hitherto been. The dail\ use of the bath, and of the currycombs with which th[ej scraped the body, produced great neatness, and entirely

In some parts of North America, infants are generally laid on couches filled with the dust of worm-eaten timber: this simple contrivance answers the useful purpose of keep- ing them dry and cleanly, as the powdered wood absorbs all moisture. When they are able to move, the solicitous mother incites them to meet her, by presenting the food appointed by Nature. Thus it is almost inconceivable that little Savages, at the tender age of a few months, especially in Africa, should possess such strength and agility as to embrace the waist of the mother with their arms and legs, without the least fear; and imbibe the maternal gift while she is engaged in fatiguing pursuits. In that country, it is truly astonishing to see infants two months old creeping about, and others somewhat older walking upon their hands and knees almost as speedily as adults.â€”On the contrary, in our quarter of the globe, it is not uncommon to see boys several years old nursed either by the breasts of an ill-advised mother, or with spoon-meat on the lap of an effeminating nurse.

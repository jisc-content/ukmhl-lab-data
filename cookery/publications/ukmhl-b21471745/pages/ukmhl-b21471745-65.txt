And she bequeathed eighteen pounds ten shillings, for four thousand four hundred masses, to be sung and said for the soul of Sir Thomas West, her lord and husband, her own soul, and all Christian souls, in the most haste that might be, within fourteen nights next after her de- cease; also forty pounds to the canons of Christ-Church, to read and sing mass for her lord's soul, and her own, while the world shall last.

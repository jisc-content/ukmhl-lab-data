577 THE IMPERIAL AROMATIC MARINE TINCTURE, AGAINST SEA-SICKNESS, SCURVY, DYSENTERY, INDIGESTION, AND THE DISEASES OF WARM CLIMATES, &C. It has long been asserted, that sea-sickness is only to be cured by habit; but before this habit can be ac- quired, all the sufferings usually concomitant with this affection must be endured, to the great inconvenience and danger of the individual affected with it. Few people are able to resist the giddiness, nausea, and retching, induced by the slightest motion of a vessel on the surface of the water. Many are equally affected by the motion of a carriage, swinging, waltzing, &c.; while on the other hand, many are not the least affected by any of these actions, however varied or violent. It cannot therefore be denied, that this variation in the effect must chiefly depend on idiosyncrasy or peculiarity of constitution; consequently, arising, as sea-sickness does, from one cause only, with- out the existence of any morbid affection, the means of treatment become more simplified than when a similar . affection arises from a variety of causes. To remove the vertigo, and consequent nausea and vomiting, and its consequences, produced by the motion of a vessel on the water, &c. which few, in fact, more or less escape, is the boasted property of the " Aromatic Marine Tincture," which for many years past has been prepared and sold in the private practice of a respectable medical practitioner, who, from the numerous well-authenticated vouchers of its combined properties (it being also anti-scorbutic, anti-dysenteric, and prophylactic) is inclined to make it more public ; and it may reasonably be inferred, that it possesses some claim to the general consideration of sea- travellers, as well as debilitatad constitutions on shore, as a safe, elegant, and no less useful preparation, which it might be advisable never to be without. To the fair- sex, whose delicate constitutions are more liable to be affected with sea-sickness, &c. and in whom excessive vomiting might be attended with the greatest risk, we conceive such a nostrum must prove of essential service, as well as to all in whom an excessive action of this nature might expose to equal danger, as it has the effect of immediately arresting the vomiting, removing the nausea, and reconciling the irritation of the stomach, by acting in sympathy with the brain, and of warding them - off by repeated doses, until the constitution cither be- 4 i)2

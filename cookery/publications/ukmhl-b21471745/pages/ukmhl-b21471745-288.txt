When it assumes a greenish yellow colour, it gives name to the green sickness. When of a yellow cast, as well as the urine, whites of the eyes, and stools white, or of a clayey appearance, jaundice may be pre- sumed to be present. Sleep returning with appetite for food, may be consi- dered as a most favourable symptom in every fever. Calm sleep, after delirium, is a favourable event. Sleepiness often precedes and accompanies erysipelas of the face ; and if it increases with the disease, it points out much danger. Sneezing, discharge of a limpid fluid from the eyes and nose, and frequent cough, shew that catarrh and coryza, as it is termed, are forming. Spirits depressed, in the beginning of fevers, shows the fever to be of a low and malignant kind. When the spirits are depressed without cause, accompanied with 'loss of appetite, sickness, pain and oppression in the stomach, distinguish hypochondriacal affections. Spitting, discoloured with blood, brought up by coughing, indicates a condition of the lungs requiring the greatest care and attention. Spots, livid, accompanied with putrid and bleeding gums, and great weakness, are signs of scurvy. Purple spots denote great danger in malignant fever. toilette.—No. I. COSMETICS AND PERFUMES.

228 Bucknall's Communications relative to Orcharding. a gentleman, for the embellishment of his residence, would wish for an orchard on either of these soils, never dig into the under strata; for that would be placing the trees in so many well-holes, where certain destruction must ensue; therefore, rather plant the trees above ground, raising over it a little mound of good fresh mould, about as large as an extensive ant-hill, under a curve of eight inches by sixty, and sow the top with white Dutch clover. Canker.—" In pruning, the medication ought never to be omitted ; for, from experience, the mercury is found to be so strongly operative in removing the baneful effects of canker in the more delicate fruit-trees, that it may be presumed to enter into the economy of the plant, giving a smoothness to the bark and freeness of growth; proofs of which will be produced to the society in a few years, by persons who have attentively considered the subject. " I shall here give an abstract of the system of close- pruning and medication, as before laid down, that it may be seen at one point of view. ee Let every stump, the decayed or blighted branches, with all those which cross the tree, or where the leaves curl, be taken off smooth and even ; pare down the gum close to the bark, and rather a little within, but not to destroy the rough coat; open the fissures, out of which the gum oozes, to the bottom; cut away the blotches, and pare down the canker; then anoint all the wounds with the medication, smearing a little over the canker, which was not large enough to be cut; score the tree, and rub off the moss; but do not shorten a single branch : follow the surgeon's rule, go to the quick, and no more; act with observation, and each practitioner will improve the science. *■ A tree under such care, must, with its remaining free shoots, run large, which requiring a great flow of sap, will keep the roots in constant employ, and from that very source necessarily establish permanent health. " P.S. Where the only object is to remove the canker, 1 find hogs'-lard preferable to tar; but where the wet is to be guarded against, tar is superlatively better."

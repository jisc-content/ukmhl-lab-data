Blistering of Children, fyc. and that absorption is carried on in the bowels, as well as the stomach. On tlie Bathing of Children, fyc. Bathing has been likewise too little, and sometimes improperly, employed in the nursery. Like emetics and clysters, it has been dreaded only because its properties have not been sufficiently understood. It would be un- necessary to prove, in this place, its salutary and unpa- ralleled effects in cutaneous eruptions of children, in scrofula or the king's evil, the rickets, and even con- sumption, which destroys about one-third of the number of those who die in the metropolis. It has been very generally, though without foundation, believed, that cold baths only are bracing or strengthening, and that warm, as well as hot baths, produce a contrary effect.

It is therefore much to be regretted, that so powerful and excellent a mean of restoring health and energy, cannot be more easily resorted to in domestic economy. Blistering of Children, fyc. Of blisters, I shall say but little. For children, I should give the preference to sinapisms, or plasters made of mustard-seed, horse-radish, and the like, to those prepared of the Spanish fly. The former are attended with the additional advantages, that they sooner affect the skin, and do not act on the fluids with such violence as the latter. They are excellent, and generally safe remedies; the temporary pain they occasion, is in no

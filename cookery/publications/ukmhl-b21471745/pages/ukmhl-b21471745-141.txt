119 ON THE COST OF TEA, AND THE PREFERENCE DUE TO MALT-LIQUOR IN A COTTAGER'S FAMILY. The annual cost of drinking tea in a cottager's family, is thus estimated by Mr. Cobbett, omitting the et ccetera. As neither strong beer nor strong tea are now under consideration, I will suppose every ounce of the I81bs. of tea to make a gallon of this beverage, and adding a pint of milk for the potion of each day, the daily quantity will be seven pints and a fraction of a pint of 114 parts in 365; and whether this may be too much or too little, depends upon the number and other circumstances of those who partake of it: the cost of it, however, will be 5<2. per day, or less by the most insignificant fraction, and equal to Id. and a fraction of Id. of 671 parts in 1152, per quart, or in even numbers it may be estimated at lid. per quart. Believing that the substitution of malt-liquor for tea, in a cottager's family, is deserving of every possible recom- mendation, the strength of each liquor must be left to the discretion and means of those who are to pay for it. I shall now compare the cost and strength of three descriptions of malt-liquor, namely, that proposed by Mr. Cobbett—that described in the Act of Parliament, 4 G. IV. c. 51, "To encourage the consumption of beer," the same to be made of " an intermediate strength between strong ale and table beer,"—and that which is adopted in Shrop- shire by alehouse-keepers, and private brewers of ale. Mr. Cobbett states, that a Winchester " bushel of malt will make eighteen gallons of better beer than that which is sold at public-houses," (paragraph 25) that is seventy- two quarts of beer to thirty-two quarts of malt. 13 lbs. of tea, at 5*. 54 lbs. of sugar, at Td. 365 pints of milk, at \d. £. s. d. 4 10 0 1 11 6 1 10 5 £7 11 11 r s. d. 6 o 7 6 9 0 10 6 1 12 0 13 6 15 0 16 6 U8 0

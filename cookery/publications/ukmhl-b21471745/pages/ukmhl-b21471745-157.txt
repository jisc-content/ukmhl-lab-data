Extract of a Letter from Mr. John Lockett, of Donnington, to Mr. More. " I took three potatoes the 17th of December, and put them into a small cask, and placed the cask in a cellar; the 10th of March I took off fifteen shoots from them, and planted them with a setting or dibbling stick, in the same manner as cabbage plants, about one foot square : the 16th of April I took twenty-one more shoots from the same three potatoes, and planted them as be- fore ; on the 22d of May I took twenty-five shoots more, and planted them also, and then washed and boiled the said three potatoes, which proved very good to eat. I had from the said sixty-one shoots, as many potatoes as weighed ninety-two pounds, notwithstanding the rooks did me much damage. " My method of procuring plants after a mild winter, is to go (about the month of May) over the fields where potatoes were planted the preceding year, and pull up from among the corn all the shoots produced by the po- tatoes left in the ground the preceding autumn, which had escaped the digger, and plant these shoots in the same manner as above, viz. the same as cabbage plants."

On the Physical Education of Children, fyc. 369 superseded by frivolous pursuits; the incessant desire of frequenting numerous and gay assemblies, drowns every attempt, occasionally made, to indulge in solitary reflec- tion, and to recover that tone of mind in which alone we can act consistently, and maintain with dignity the more or less important stations we hold in society. Whether such propensities ought to be checked, or cautiously regulated, in the rising generation, is a question not easily answered ; for we much doubt whether it would be compatible with the present spirit of the times, to attempt an innovation which might render the votaries of pleasure liable to complaints arising from an irksome mode of life, and consequently make them dissatisfied with the world. The catalogue of suicides, indeed, alarmingly increases. We humbly conceive, we are not to be re- moved from this vortex; but a more natural and consistent education of our progeny, will restore them to that happy state of our ancestors, who, together with manly virtues and dignified pursuits, enjoyed an enviable state of health. Nature, no doubtA intended man to become the inha- bitant of the whole globe : hence his constitution could not, like that of the lower animals, remain uniform in every region of the earth; and hence we may discover its modifications according to climate, aliment, habit, and education. All these exert their influence on the in- stinctive desires of man; and it is on account of this variety of circumstances, when he appears under forms so diversified, that it is sometimes difficult to comprehend, whether such deviations can exist in one and the same human species. But provident Nature, in every climate, and in every situation, guides and directs him to the means of i^reserving his health, and rendering his life as comfortable and happy as is consistent with his moral and physical condition. The inhabitants on the banks of the river Senegal, are for several months in the year exposed to a heat which is sufficient to boil spirit of wine; while those of Hudson's and David's Bays are under the influ- ence of a degree of eold, which sometimes congeals alcohol, and even mercury; and yet, parental Nature has enabled them both, not only to live, but even to enjoy a tolerable state of health, in the most opposite climates. 3 a 2

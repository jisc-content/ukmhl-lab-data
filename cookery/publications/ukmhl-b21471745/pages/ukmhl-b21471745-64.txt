i2 A RECIPE TO ESTABLISH TRUE FRIENDSHIP. In Pliny's Natural History, there is a curious recipe for making the Roman friendship; a cordial that was uni- versally esteemed in those days, and very lew families of any credit were without it. In the same place, he says, they were indebted to the Greeks for this recipe, who had it in the greatest perfection. The old Roman friendship was a composition of seve- ral ingredients, of which the principal was union of hearts, a fine flower that grew in several parts of the empire; sincerity, frankness, disinterestedness, pity, and tenderness, of each an equal quantity : these were all blended toge- ther with two rich oils, which were called perpetual hind wishes and serenity of temper; and the whole was strongly perfumed with' the desire of pleasing, which gave it a most grateful smell, and was a sure restorative in all sorts of vapours. This cordial, thus prepared, was of so durable a nature, that no length of time could waste it: and what is very remarkable, says our author, it increased in weight and value the longer you kept it. This fine recipe has been most grossly adulterated by the moderns: some of the ingredients indeed are not to be found; but what they impose on you as friendship, is as follows: Outward professions, a common weed that grows every where, instead of the flower of union; the desire of being pleased, a large quantity; of self-interest, conveniency, and reservedness, many handfuls; a little pity and tenderness. But some pretend to make up without these two last; and the common oil of inconstancy, which, like our linseed- oil, is cold-drawn every hour, serves to mix them toge- ther. Most of these ingredients being of a perishable nature, the composition will not keep, and shews itself to be counterfeit, by continually diminishing in weight and value. A CURIOUS ANCIENT WILL*.

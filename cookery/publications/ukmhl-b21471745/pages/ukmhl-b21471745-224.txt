Prescriptions, Charms used by the Moors of Barbary, %b. The moors of Barbary, and generally throughout the Mahomedan dominions, the people are remarkably at- tached to charms, to which, and Nature, they leave the cure of almost every distemper; and this is the more strongly impressed on them, from the belief in predesti- nation, which, according to this sect, stipulates the evils & man is to suffer, as well as the length of time it is ordained he should live upon the land of his forefathers â€¢ consequently they conceive that the interference of secon- dary means would avail them nothing: an opinion said to have been entertained by King William, but by no means calculated for nations, liberty, and commerce ; upon the principle, that when the one was intrenched upon, men would probably be more sudden in their revenge, and dislike physic and its occupation, and when actuated with religious enthusiasm, nothing could stand them in any service.

Baths, Wells, Waters, and Mineral Springs. 007 SCARBOROUGH. The two-fold attraction of sea-bathing and mineral waters, which this place affords, renders it, if not so fashionable, frequently, much superior to other places; and for these reasons, it contains among its numerous visitors, more votaries of health than of dissipation. This ancient and populous town is situated in the south-east corner of the North Biding of Yorkshire, at the bottom of a beautiful bay, from which it rises in the form of a crescent, on the slope of a bold and varied shore, presenting several points of great elevation, and is sheltered from the north-east by a rock of high accli- vity, surrounded by the sea, except on the western side.

There are here three separate establishments, where warm and cold sea water, steam and shower baths, may be had, when requiredâ€”two of them on the cliff; one of which is kept by a surgeon, the other by a physician, and the third, near the pier, by a gentleman of the latter distinction. There is also a general sea-bathing infirmary, on the plan of the Margate Bethseda, where the sick poor are allowed to drink the waters gratuitously. Tfie Spa; its Situation, Properties, fyc. The Spa is about a quarter of a mile, in a southerly direction, from the town, on the sands, at the foot of a high cliff, and rises upright out of the earth, near the level of the spring-tides, which often overflow it.

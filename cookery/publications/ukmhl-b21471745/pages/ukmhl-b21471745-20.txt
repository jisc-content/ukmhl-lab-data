On the other hand, there are re- medies not secret, but entirely inert, which attain a high degree of reputation, most commonly from the salutary powers of nature being mistaken for the effect of artificial appliances, or from the power of imagination. In proof of this, we have introduced some interesting remarks on AMULETS.

JUDGE BULLER'S OBSERVATIONS, ON THE UTILITY AND BENEFIT TO BE DERIVED FROM DESTROYING MACHINES INTENDED TO EXPEDITE LABOUR. In an action tried at the Salisbury assizes in 1791, brought by Mr. Phelps against the hundred of Bradford, to recover the damage he had sustained in consequence of a riot, by which his house and furniture were partly demolished, and a machine used in scribbling wool, taken from his workshops and burnt; on the jury finding a ver- dict for full damages, Judge Buller made the following observations: " The workmen have shewn their disapprobation to the different improvements that have taken place in other manufactories as well as this; but deluded, infatuated people, how have they mistaken their own interests! I know myself the advantage which machines have been to the cotton manufactory in Lancashire; for there, where only four thousand people were employed, there are now forty thousand; and were the gentlemen con- cerned in that business to give up their machines, it would occasion greater jealousies and discontents than were caused by their first introduction. " This country has long been famous for making super- fine cloth, in which it has excelled, and supplied, not only this country, but all Europe, with that article ; antj if machines are not used, to enable the manufacturer to sell as cheap as other countries now do, they will be undersold, and find their goods returned on their hands; for that man who can afford to sell his commodity the cheapest, will have the greatest sale, and the most ex- peditiously increase his concern: independent of this consequence, it is a public benefit,"

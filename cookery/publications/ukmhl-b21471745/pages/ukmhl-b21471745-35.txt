Various modes have been devised for strengthening the stomach, and keeping the whole apparatus of diges- tion in good condition. In Sweden, the elixir of Dr. Jernitz was held in general repute; and, as a proof of its efficacy, it is stated that the Doctor himself lived to the age of 104 years, his son to 100, and that the whole family, by the constant use of it, attained a great age. Numbers also in the same country, are said to have re- ceived great benefit from it. The following is the receipt for making this elixir, as presented to Sir John Sinclair, Bart.; which, whether it may prolong life or not, we cannot disapprove of it, as an excellent stomachic tincture. It has been tried in England, and found serviceable to the stomach; and by strengthening that important organ, it is said also to render persons less liable to catch cold.

History and Uses of the Aloe Plant. 489 tance of two or three inches from each other, and stretch- ing the cord upon the brink of a running water, suffer the leaves to soak during eight or ten days, according to the greater or less degree of heat, and the greater or less hardness of the leaves. After they have been sufficiently soaked, they are placed upon a flat stone, and beaten with another stone, cut into a half circumference, until the skin and the parenchyma are bruised, and the ali- mentary juice forced out of the first fibres, which are always coarser and larger than the rest. In this state the leaves are placed singly upon a table, their larger end remaining loose, but the other being fastened to the table with a nail; when the leaves are scraped with a blunt and smooth iron, shaped like the sides of a bayonet, of which weapon the soldiers generally make use, from an unwil- lingness to purchase an iron instrument merely for that purpose. After the leaves have been scraped about twenty or thirty times, the transverse and unequal fibres are broken off, and thrown away, and the table is covered with a greenish juice, exhaling alkaline particles of so caustic a quality, that the hands of the soldiers are usually rendered quite raw, and their eyes exceedingly inflamed. But as cold water is the only remedy they employ, I am inclined to think that the styptic quality of this plant is of the same nature as that of the leaves of the clemmatis, better known by the name of the beggar's herb, because it is employed by vagabonds and beggars in making supposed inflammations and ulcers, in order to excite our commiseration, and of which they can quickly cure themselves by the use of cold water.. As this first operation of scraping only forward the work by the removal of the coarser fibres, those of which the thread is to be made, are as yet scarcely to be perceived ; but after the leaf has been turned, with the point remain- ing loose, and the larger end fastened to the table, and after it has again undergone the operation of scraping, the fibres, freed from every extraneous body, display them- selves in full force, and form as many filaments, of a yellow colour, like that of raw silk, not of the orange kind, but of that which comes from oif the white cocoons. To deprive the thread of that colour, and preserve it from the corruption which might take place if it were left covered with the juice of the plant, it is soaked during three days in a tub of cold water, after which it is washed and beaten in a running stream, by which means the thread 3 Q 2

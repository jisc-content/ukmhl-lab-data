INTRODUCTION. Under the head of TOILETTE, (COSMETICS, and PERFUMERY), a select collection of recipes for making the most fragrant Perfumes and Cosmetics, many of which possess medicinal and detergent properties, and as such are really useful, consequently will be appreciated by both sexes, in whom attention to dress, if not attended with too great a sacri- fice of time, is not only justifiable, but laudable; for a solicitous regard to neatness (we do not mean preciseness), preserves that air of delicacy, without which, the ardour inspired by the brightest charms will speedily sicken into disgust.

Neither the mind nor the person, indeed, ought to be disguised with the enamel of art; but both should be kept free from the soil of negligence, and graced with such ornaments as are most congenial with their respective peculiarities.

To be brief, all complexion beautifiers,

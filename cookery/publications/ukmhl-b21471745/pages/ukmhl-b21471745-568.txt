550 Cookery for the Sick, and for the Poor. Chicken Broth. Put the body and legs of the fowl that chicken panada was made of, after taking off the skin and rump, into the water it was boiled in, with one blade of mace, one slice of onion, and ten white peppercorns. Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If not water enough, add a little. Beat a quarter of an ounce of sweet almonds with a tea-spoonful of water, fine, boil it in the broth, strain, and, when cold, remove the fat. Eel Broth. Clean half a pound of small eels, and set them on with three pints of water, some parsley, one slice of onion, a few peppercorns; let them simmer till the eels are broken, and the broth good. Add salt, and strain it off. The above should make three half-pints of broth. Tenth Broth. Make as eel broth. They are both very nutritious, and light of digestion. Beef Tea. Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices; simmer with a quart of water twenty minutes, after it has once boiled, and been skimmed. Season, if approved; but it has ge- nerally only salt. Dr. Ratcliff's Restorative Pork Jelly^ Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up, beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire, with three gal- lons of water, and simmer to one. Let half an ounce of mace, and the same of nutmegs, stew in it. Strain through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give a chocolate-cup the first and last thing, and at noon, putting salt to taste. Arrow-root Jelly. Of this beware of having the wrong sort, for it has been counterfeited with bad effect. If genuine, it is very nou- rishing,-especially for weak bowels. Put into a sauce- pan half a pint of water, a glass of sherry or a spoonful of brandy, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar; boil up once, then mix it by degrees into a dessert-spoonful of arrow- root, previously rubbed smooth with two spoonsful of cold water; then return the whole into the saucepan; stir, and boil it three minutes.

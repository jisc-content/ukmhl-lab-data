15 STOMACH PILLS. Take Powder of ipecacuanha, - 1 scruple. Powder of rhubarb, - 2 scruples. Simple syrup, - - a sufficient quantity. Make twenty-four pills, and take one every night at bed-time. For weak and delicate stomachs, these pills have been recommended by an eminent physician. TOOTH-ACHE, AND ANTI-RHEUMATIC EMBROCATION. In no department of the medical practice, is there more dangerous quackery than that afforded by the tooth- ache. This complaint is, to those who have the misfor- tune to be visited with it, an intolerable source of tor- ment. Neither stoics nor philosophers can endure it; and what is worse, the fair sex, the weaker vessels, are more frequently its victim than the sturdy and athletic male. When this affliction befalls any one, we recommend the following embrocation, in either of the proportions, according to the purpose for which it may be wanted, on good authority, as well as from personal observation: Take Sal volatile, 3 drachms or 9 drachms.

For a general face-ache, or sore throat, moisten a bit of flannel with some of it, and at bed-time apply it to the part affected. Keeping the bowels open, by taking half an ounce of Epsom salts at bed-time, and applying the above, we have witnessed the most inveterate attacks of face and tooth-ache, rheumatism, &c. alleviated, and frequently removed within twenty-four hours.

To their friends and com- panions, the latter become a much more insufferable spectacle than the first. An excessive anxiety about health, generally produces that morbid carefulness which is called ' quacking one's self;' a custom to which many

593 Mucilaginous Oils. OIL OF BEN. From the nuts of the guilandia moringa; scentless, colourless, keeps long without growing rank; used in perfumery, to receive and retain the odour of those vege- tables that yield but little essential oil, and thus forms the basis of the best sort of Huiles antiques. CAMELLIA OIL. From the seeds of camellia aleosa: used for the table. HEMP OIL. From hemp seed; good for frying in: used by the painters as a drying oil. NETTLE-TREE OIL. From seeds of celtis australis : excellent for the lamp. CORNEL OIL. From the seeds of cornus mascula and sanguinea: answers for lamps, but not for the table. OIL OP COMMON PHYSIC-NUT. Used as castor oil for a purge. NUT OIL. From the kernel of the hazel nut; very fine substitute for oil of Ben: as it will keep better than that of almonds, it has been proposed to be substituted for that oil in the College lists, being nearly equal to it; is drank with tea in China, probably in lieu of cream : used by painters as a superior vehicle for their colours. BEECH MAST OIL. Very clear, keeps well; and is a very good salad oil: is used in Silesia in lieu of butter. BUCK-WHEAT OIL. From the seeds of buck-wheat, or fagopyrum. HEMP NETTLE OIL. From the seeds of galeopsis tetrahit. Yielded very plentifully. GINGKO OIL. From the seeds ofgingko beloba: used for the table. SUN-FLOWER SEED OIL. From the seeds of helianthus annuus: they yield well, and are recommended for cultivation ; perhaps the Jeru- salem artichoke would answer better, as bcth the root and seed would be saleable. 4 v '2

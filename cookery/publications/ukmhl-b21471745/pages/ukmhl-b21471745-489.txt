Organic Defects. 471 What machine, of the most adamantine material, will not soon be the worse for wear, from such incessant vibration, especially if the main-springs of it are not pre- served in a state of due regulation? The generative faculties, which are the last that Nature iiuishes, are the first that fail. Economy in the exercise of them, especially before and after the second stage of life, is the grand precept for the restoration and accumu- lation of strength, the preservation of health, and the prolongation of life;—we are vigorous, in proportion to the perfection of the performance of the restorative pro- cess, i.e. as we eat hearty, and sleep soundly; as our body loses the power of renovating itself, in like ratio fails its faculty of creating; what may be a salutary sub- duction of the superfluous health of the second, during the third period of life will be a destructive sacrifice of the strength of both the mind and the body .—See also the 9th chapter of the first edition of Willich onDiet, 8vo. 1799. The next organic defect (we perceive too plainly for our self-love to mistake it) is manifested by the eye. To read a small print, you must remove it from the eye further than you have been accustomed to do, and place it in a better light. The falsetto voice now begins to fail, and the ear loses some of its quickness ; several extraordinary musicians have been able till then, if a handful of the keys of a harpsichord were put down, so as to produce the most The expectations of Life are thus calculated by De Moivre : Subtract the age of the person from 86 ; half the remainder will be the expectation of that Life. The following Table, founded on experience, may serve as a proof of the relative duration of Human Life at present: Of 100 men who are born, 50 die before the 10th Year, 20 between the 10th and the 20th, 10 between the 20th and the 30th, 6 between the 30th and the 40th, 5 between the 40th and the 50th, 3 between the 50th and the 60th ; Therefore, 6 only live to be above the age of 60. Haller, who collected the greatest number of instances respecting the Age of Man, found the relative duration of Life to be on the following proportion : Of men who lived from 100 to 110 Years, the instances have been 1000, Of from 110 to 130 60, 120 to 130.

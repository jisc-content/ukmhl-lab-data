Miscellaneous Recipes, 139 one ounce and a half; rectified spirit, two ounces :—used as the clothes ball. Breeches Ball. Bath brick, one pound; pipe clay, twenty-eight pounds; pummice-stone powder, four ounces; ox-gall, six ounces; they may be coloured with rose pink, yellow oker, umber, fresh slate, &c. to any desired shade. Silver Boiling Powder. White argol, common salt, and alum, of each equal parts; a small quantity of this powder is put into water, and plate, to which it gives a brilliant whiteness, is boiled in it. Plate Powder. 1. Quicksilver, with chalk, one ounce; prepared chalk, four ounces. 2. Polisher's putty, and burnt hartshorn, eight ounces; whiting, one pound. 3. Prepared crab's eyes, two ounces; levigated oxyd of tin (commonly sold under the name of prepared putty), three drachms; quicksilver, two drachms. Rub the quicksilver with the oxyd of tin, in a marble mortar, for half an hour, and then add the crab's eyes, and continue the rubbing for an hour longer. *** This powder is sometimes used with spirit of wine, but when the plate is not tarnished, it is not necessary, I am aware that the prepared crab's eyes are only pre- pared chalk, but being reduced to a more palpable pow- der than the article sold under the name of prepared chalk, I have always preferred them.

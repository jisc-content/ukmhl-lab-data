He regained his health, but he lost his love; the strength of his dis- order had abated that of his passion, and when he thought himself a lover, he found that he had ceased to love. There is, however, another species of evacuation, not less efficacious for a despairing swain, which will proba- bly amuse the reader. A German gentleman felt an amorous flame for a German Princess.

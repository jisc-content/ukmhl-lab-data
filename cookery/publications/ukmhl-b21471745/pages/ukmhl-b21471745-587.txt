569 Pickling, Â§c. TO SALT HAMS. For three hams, pound and mix together half a peck of salt, half an ounce of salt prunella, three ounces of salt- petre, and four pounds of coarse salt; rub the hams well with this, and lay what is to spare over them; let them lie three days, then hang them up. Take the pickle in which the hams were, put water enough to cover the hams, with more common salt, till it will bear an egg, then boil and skim well, put it in the salting tub, and the next morning put in the hams; keep them down the same as pickled pork; in a fortnight take them out of the liquor, rub them well with brine, and hang them up to dry. TO DRY SALT BEEF AND PORK. Lay the meat on a table or in a tub with a double bot- tom, that the brine may drain off as fast as it forms, rub the salt well in, and be careful to apply it to every niche; afterwards put it into either of the above utensils, when it must be frequently turned; after the brine has ceased running, it must be quite buried in salt, and kept closely packed. Meat which has had the bones taken out is the best for salting. In some places the salted meat is pressed by heavy weights, or a screw, to extract the moisture sooner. TO PICKLE IN BRINE. A good brine is made of bay salt and water, thoroughly saturated, so that some of the salt remains undissolved; into this brine the substances to be preserved are plunged, and kept covered with it. Among vegetables, French beans, artichokes, olives, and the different sorts of sam- phire, may be thus preserved, and among animals her- rings. To Salt by another Method. Mix brown sugar, bay salt, common salt, each two pounds, salt-petre eight ounces, water two gallons; this pickle gives meat a fine red colour, while the sugar ren- ders them mild and of excellent flavour. Large quanti- ties are to be managed by the above proportions. 1 c -i i

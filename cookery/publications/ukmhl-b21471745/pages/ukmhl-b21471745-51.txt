Reflections on the Health, Education, Sjc. of Children. 29 then only we admit that young children are better at home, within the range of a more uniform degree of tempera- ture. No one can doubt that children are born with various dispositions, or the germs of such dispositions; and it is equally true, that by proper and timely management, these dispositions may be so changed and meliorated by the attention of a parent, or those to whom they are entrusted, that not only their little blemishes may be smoothed away, but even those things which more offen- sively distinguish the child, may, by proper discipline, become the characteristic ornaments of the man.

The effects of such an insensible and capricious line of con- duct, and the serious consequences, must strike home to the bosom of every parent alive to his duty, as at once uncharitable and inconsistent: continually undergoing either disappointment or punishment, Or engaged in extorting gratifications, which he often triumphs at hav-

104 The Folly of delaying to make a Will. vested in individuals by the right of occupancy, it became necessary for the peace of society, that this occupancy should be continued, not only in the present possessor, but in those persons to whom he should think proper to transfer it; and this first introduced the practice of alie- nations and gifts ; but if we were restricted to those, the privilege would still be imperfect; for upon the death of the occupier, all his goods would again become common, and create an infinite variety of strife and contention. The law of very many societies has therefore given to the proprietor, a right of continuing his property after his death, in such persons as he shall name, and in defect of such appointment or nomination, or where no nomina- tion is permitted, the law of every society has directed the goods to be vested in certain particular individuals, exclusive of all other persons. In England, as the same author observes, this power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the law; for we have no traces or memorials of any time when it did not exist. Such is the law upon this subject, and we know that scarcely any crime is more severely punished in the civil courts, than any departure from the will of a testator. Guarded therefore, as this privilege is, by express laws, and considered as sacred by public opinion, it is lament- able that it should be so often exercised to prove the wickedness or imbecility of our natures; that it should be attended to only when attention cannot be com- manded, and that it should be neglected even by those, who, from a thousand motives, might be supposed inte- rested in its being well and duly executed. These evils appear to us to arise from two causes, though perhaps it is not necessary to consider them distinctly—we mean, cither putting ofF the making a will to a distant and incon- venient period, or neglecting it altogether: the latter perhaps sometimes is intentional, as in the case of a person, who thinks that he ought not to violate an impru- dent promise in behalf of some one, which would injure his heirs-at-law—but more often this proceeds from the first cause, a perpetual delay and backwardness to per- form the most simple and easy act of human obligation. The Folly of delaying to make a Will. It is not easy to account for this backwardness in men of sense ; for all the reasons assigned to excuse it, are not very consistent with common sense.

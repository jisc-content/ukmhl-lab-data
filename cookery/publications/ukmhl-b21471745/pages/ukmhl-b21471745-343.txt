How in every Year to procure plenty of New-laid Eggs at Christmas. Let the hens be set upon eggs as early in the year as possible, not later than March. A hutch should be made for the hen and chickens, twenty-four inches long, twelve inches wide, and eighteen high, divided in the middle, so as half to be open and half very close ; let down a door to keep them very warm in the night; and when wet or very cold, if made light, it may easily be put under shelter.

A gentleman writes that, one summer walking in a . friend's garden, a very fine frog leaped upon the path he stood upon: being an admirer of nature, he watched it under a gooseberry-bush, where there happened to lay a large leaf of a tulip; the frog immediately mounted on

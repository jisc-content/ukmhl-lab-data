Housekeeping and Husbandry. An Estimation of the Loss of Weight which takes place in Cooking Animal Food. [From the Philosophical Magazine.-] " It is well known, that, in whatever way the flesh of animals is prepared for food, a considerable diminution takes place in its weight. We do not recollect, however, to have seen any where a statement of the loss which meat sustains in the various culinary processes, although it is pretty obvious that a series of experiments on this subject, would not be without their use in domestic economy. " We shall here give the result of a series of experi- ments which were actually made on this subject in a public establishment; premising that, as they were not undertaken from mere curiosity, but, on the contrary, to serve a purpose of practical utility, absolute accuracy was not attended to. Considering, however, the large quantities of provisions which were actually examined, it is presumed that the results may be safely depended upon for any practical purpose. It would no doubt have been desirable, to have known not only the whole diminu- tion of weight, but also the parts which were separated from the meat in the form of aqueous vapour, jelly, fat, &c.; but the determination of these did not fall within the scope of the enquiry. lbs. oss.

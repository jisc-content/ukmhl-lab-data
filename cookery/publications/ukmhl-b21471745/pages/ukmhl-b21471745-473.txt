455 PLAIN DIRECTIONS FOR FAMILY-BREWING, ON ECONOMICAL AND SALUTARY PRINCIPLES, &C. Every person intending to brew for himself, must be careful to see his malt measured and ground ; by no means trusting to the corn-chandlers, who frequently impose both in quality and quantity, on those who are so incautious as not to see their malt measured and ground in their own presence. The tubs and vessels intended for use, must be care- fully inspected, and proved to be free from dirt or taint, as the least defect of that nature may distaste a whole brewing. The mash-tub should be particularly attended to; and a whisp of clean hay or straw put over the end of the vessel in the inside, to prevent the malt running off with the liquor. The malt being emptied into the mash-^tub, and the water brought to boil, dash the boiling water in the copper with cold water sufficient to stop the boiling, and leave it just hot enough to bite smartly upon your finger: a few trials will enable any person to be exact upon this head. Brewers use a thermometer containing 212 degrees, which is boiling heat: the first mash is usually taken at 180 hot, and the second 190 hot; but as few persons will have opportunity, or afford expence, to pur- chase a brewing thermometer, the foregoing rule will be found sufficiently instructive, by a little practice, always remembering to draw off your second mash somewhat hotter than the first. The water being thus properly brought to a temper by the addition of cold water, lade it out of your copper over the malt, till it becomes thoroughly wet, mashing it well, to prevent your malt clotting; when the water goes on too hot, it sets the malt, and closes the body of it, and when that happens, it is difficult to recover it, which can only be done by adding cold water. By setting the malt, is to be understood, its closing the body of the grain, instead of opening it so as to dissolve in the liquor. Cover up your mash-tub close, to compress the steam, and prevent the heat from evaporating: in small quantities this should carefully be regarded, in larger ones it does not signify so much. Let the wort stand after mashing an hour and a half or two hours, then let the liquor run off into a vessel pre- pared to receive it; if at first it runs thick and discoloured, 3 M

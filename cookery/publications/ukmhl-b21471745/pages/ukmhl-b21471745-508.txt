490 History and Uses of the Aloe Plant. becomes softer and richer, without losing any thing of its consistence. Each leaf affords a complete skain, more or less thick, according to the size of the leaf. Fifteen or twenty of these skains are tied to a cord, and hung up in a garret, or other airy place, where there is a constant shade; for if the sun were to shine upon the thread in that state, it would immediately turn it yellow, and give it a stiffness which it would be afterward impossible to remedy. When properly made and dried, this thread is much used in Sicily, and still more in Spain, where manufac- tories have been established, particularly in Catalonia, in which this thread is employed not only in making harness for horses in the tournaments, nets of various kinds, Women's neck handkerchiefs, night-caps, ruffles de gros- botte, men's ruffles, and cauls of caps; but as the thread will take any colour, they also use it in making a variety of stuffs, and especially handkerchiefs, which they sell us for India handkerchiefs made of the bark of trees; but as the thread can never be of greater length than the leaf, it is only employed in the web, the rest of the work being done with silk. These stuffs have, however, a very evident de- fect in the visible difference between the softness and richness of the silk, and the coarse quality of the thread, which renders them by no means lasting; for after a certain time, the silk is worn out by the mere friction of the harder body. The tint of the silk also is different, and presents to the touch a soft and smooth surface, while the thread takes its colour almost in the same manner as the Russia leather; that is to say, that the epidermis of its exterior surface alone imbibes it, while the body of the thread remains unaffected. It is now some years since a proposal relative to the thread of the aloe-plant was made to the merchants at Palermo by a Frenchman, of the name of Gouion, born at Hanover, and descended from one of those refugee fami- lies who, after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, en- riched other countries with arts before familiar to the French alone. This person, uniting a knowledge of the mechanical arts to that of the fabrication of silks, velvets, and taffetas, proposed to make a machine, which, by the help of water, should divide each thread into two parts, and thus produce the double advantage of rendering the thread finer and more supple, and of offering to the manu- facturer a smoother surface, extremely suitable to several

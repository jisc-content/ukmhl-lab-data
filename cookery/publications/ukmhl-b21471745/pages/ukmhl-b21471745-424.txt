Ungovernable Avarice. 406 is worn out by the vehemence of its labour; and though the excitement is really less than at first, because there is less vascular vigour for its support, it is still greater than ever, compared with the weakened state of the sentient organ.. Yet love, sickness itself, whatever mischief it may work in the corporeal frame, by sleepless nights, a fever- ish pulse, and loss of appetite; and however, from the exalted state of the imagination, and the increased sen- sibility of the body, it may transpose the reality of life into a kind of visionary existence, and so far produce mental derangement, rarely leads to direct insanity, so long as there is the remotest hope of the attainment of its object. But if hope be suddenly cut off by an inexorable refusal, the intervention of a more fortunate rival, the concealment of the object of adoration, or any other cause whatever, the mind is sometimes incapable of re- sisting the shock thus produced by the concurrent yet opposite powers of desire and despair; and in a moment when the judgment is completely overwhelmed, the lover sick maniac calls to his aid the demoniacal passion of revenge, and, almost at hazard, determines upon a plan of murder, directed against his rival, his mistress, or himself.

The body grows thin in the midst of wealth, the limbs totter, though surrounded by cordials, and the man voluntarily starves himself in the granary of plenty; not from a want of appetite, but from a dread of giving way to it. The individual who is in such a state of mind, must be estranged upon this point, how much soever he maybe at home upon others. Yet these are cases that arc daily occurring, and have been in all ages; though per- haps one of the most curious is that related by Valerius Maximus, of a miser who took advantage of a famine, to

13J PROGNOSTICS OF FOUL WEATHER. The hollow winds begin to blow; The clouds look black, the glass is low; The soot falls down, the spaniels sleep; And spiders from their cobwebs peep. Last night the sun went pale to bed; The moon in halos hid her head. The boding shepherd heaves a sigh, For, see, a rainbow spans the sky. The walls are damp, the ditches smell, Clos'd is the pink-ey'd pimpernel. Hark I how the chairs and tables crackâ€” Old Betty's joints are on the rack : Her corns with shooting pains torment her, And to her bed untimely send her. Loud quack the ducks, the sea-fowl cry, The distant hills are looking nigh. How restless are the snorting swine ! The busy flies disturb the kine. Low o'er the grass the swallow wings; The cricket too, how sharp he sings ! Puss on the hearth, with velvet paws, Sits wiping o'er her whisker'd jaws. The smoke from chimneys right ascends; Then spreading, back to earth it bends. The wind unsteady veers around, Or settling, in the South is found. Through the clear stream the fishes rise, And nimbly catch the incautious flies. The glow-worms num'rous, clear and bright, Ilium'd the dewy hill last night. At dusk the squalid toad was seen, Like quadruped, stalk o'er the green. The whirling wind the dust obeys, And in the rapid eddy plays. The frog has chang'd his yellow vest, And in a ?-usset coat is drest. The sky is green, the air is still, The mellow blackbird's voice is shrill. The dog, so alter'd is his taste, Quits mutton-bones, on grass to feast. Behold the rooks, how odd their flight; They imitate the gliding kite, And seem precipitate to fall, As if they felt the piercing ball. The tender colts on back do lie, Nor heed the traveller passing by. In fiery red the sun doth rise, Then wades through clouds to mount the skies. 'Twill surely rain, we see't with sorrow, No working in the fields to-morroiu. DARWIN.

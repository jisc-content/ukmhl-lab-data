The best ground for raising the plant, is a warm rich soil, not subject to be over-run with weeds; for from these it must be totally cleared. The soil in which it grows in Virginia, is inclining to sandy, consequently warm and light; the nearer, therefore, the nature of the land ap- proaches to that, the greater probability there is of its flourishing here. The situation most preferable for a plantation, is the southern declivity of a hill, or a spot that is sheltered from the blighting north winds which so frequently blow, during the spring months, in this island. But at the same time the plants must enjoy a free current of air; for if that be obstructed, they will not prosper. Seed. As the tobacco plant, being an annual, is only to be raised from seed, the greatest care in purchasing these is necessary; lest, by sowing such as is not good, we lose, with the expected crop, the season. The different sorts of the seeds not being distinguishable from each other, nor the goodness to be ascertained by their appearance, the purchaser should apply to a person of character in that profession. In describing the manner in which the plant ought to be raised from the seed, as well as in the suc- ceeding progress, I shall confine myself to the practice of the northern colonies of America, as these are more parallel in their latitude to England. Time to sow the Seed, &c. About the middle of April, or rather soonerin a forward spring, sow the seed in beds first prepared for the purpose with some warm rich manure. In a cold spring, regular hot-beds would be most eligible for this purpose ; and indeed the gardeners of this county are persuaded, that the Nicotania cannot be raised in any other way; but these are seldom to be found in common gardens, and I am convinced that if the weather is not remarkably severe,

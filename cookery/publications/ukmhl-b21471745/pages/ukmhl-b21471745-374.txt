As the efficacy of Cheltenham waters depends on the happy combinations of iron with other saline bodies, the superabundance of this - invigorating substance which exists in the spring above mentioned, must certainly give it a decided pre-eminence over those in which this metal is not so abundant. The strengthening qualities of the iron enables the stomach to bear a quantity of water sufficient to produce the desired effect, without the feeling of distention at the time of taking it, or languor and debility after its operation.

It is particularly recommended in bilious disorders, stomach complaints, eruptive and cutaneous affections, and intes- tinal worms. During the summer of 1804, a pump was fixed in the well, which works with great ease at the depth of forty feet; and it is now covered over by a temporary building, for the accommodation of the drinkers.

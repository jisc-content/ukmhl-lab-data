487 HISTORY AND USES OF THE ALOE PLANT. [From Travels through various Provinces of the Kingdom of Naples, by Charles Ulysses, of Salis Marschli?is.] The plant which we call aloe, and which grows in great abundance in Persia, under the name of zabar, is commonly termed zabbara in Sicily and Spain, where, as well as in India and the American Islands, it is found in great plenty. The southern coasts of Italy also furnish a very considerable number; but it is not equally flourishing every where, neither does the stem always attain the height of which it is susceptible, and which some travellers declare to arrive at thirty-four feet—(pieds de roi)—and indeed I saw some near Girgenti, in Sicily, whose stems were upward of twenty-eight feet high. As the figure of this plant is too well known to need any description, I shall content myself with noting its varieties, and its use in medicine; after which I shall enter into a detail relative as well to the extraction of the thread, as to the articles of commerce, in which it is and might be employed by prudent regulations, and a well understood spirit of economy and order. Most of the botanists, predecessors of Linnaeus, were so attached to the more striking varieties of plants, that they classed them according to their exterior characteristic differences, and reckoned five species of the aloe-plant; but the celebrated botanist of Sweden, more exact in his observations, has enumerated eight species, under the titles of aloes perfoliata, variegata, disticha, spiralis, retusa, viscosa, pumila, and varia, among which he likewise notices the necessary subdivisions. But this analysis not being the intermediate object of attention, I shall proceed to observe, that none but the aloes perfoliata and viscosa are used in furnishing the thread ; the fibres of the others being too tender for that purpose ; but the agave Ameri- cana affords a much better sort of thread. The juice of the aloe-plant was employed in ancient much more than in modern pharmacy, in chronic and ob- stinate disorders, especially those of the hypochondriac cast, acidities of the stomach, worms, obstructions of the bowels, and other disorders arising therefrom ; provided the patients were not subject to spitting of blood, or to any hemorrhoidal flux, whether internal or external, and particularly to that of the inward carotid, where the Uga- 3 o

INTRODUCTION. IV to tempt the unwary from the road of temperance, to their destruction. The empiricism of the non-practical scribes, namely, the writers, or rather the compilers, of certain use- less and contradictory recipes, under fictitious names, either for food or physic, are equally as reprehensible and fatal to health, economy, and good living, as the nostrum of the quack, held up as a specific for certain diseases, where pump water alone might, with more propriety, and infi- nitely less risk, claim all its pretensions.

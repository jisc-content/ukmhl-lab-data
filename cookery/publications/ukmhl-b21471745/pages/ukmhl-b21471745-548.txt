Observations. *** By pursuing the rules which I have endeavoured to give in as explicit terms as possible, country gentle- men and landholders in general will be enabled to raise much better tobacco than that which is usually imported from Maryland or Virginia: for notwithstanding there are not wanting prohibitory laws in those countries to prevent the planters from sending to market any but the principal leaves, yet they frequently, to increase their profit, sutler, the sprouts to grow, and mix the smaller leaves of these, with the others, which renders them much inferior m SÂ°ThTcrops that I have reason to believe may be raised in England, will greatly exceed in flavour and emcacy any that is imported from the southern colonies: lor though northern climates require far more care and ex- actness to bring tobacco to a proper state of maturity than warmer latitudes, yet this tardiness of growth tends to impregnate the plants with a greater quantity of salts, and consequently with that aromatic flavour for which it is prized, than is to be found in the produce of hotter cli- mates, where it is brought to a state of perfection, from the seed, in half the time required in colder regions. A pound of tobacco raised in New England or Nova Scotia, is supposed to contain as much real strength as fw pounds from Virginia; and 1 doubt not but that near double the quantity of salts might be extracted from it by a IhSra\so7ust'add, though the example can only be followed in particular parts of these kingdoms that the Americans usually choose for the place where they intend to make the seedling bed, part of a copse, or a spot of ground covered with wood, of which they burn down such a nortion as they think necessary. Having done this, they rake up the subjacent mould, and mixing it with the ashes pr'oduced/sow therein the seed, without adding any other manure, or taking any other steps Where *his method cannot be pursued, wood-ashes may be strewed over the mould in which the seed is designed to be sown To theses already known, there is another to which tobacco might be applied, that I believe has never been thought of by Europeans; and which may render it much more estimable than any other. It has been found by the

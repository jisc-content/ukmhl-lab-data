THE COTTAGE PHYSICIAN, AND FAMILY ADVISER, " Dread winter spreads his latest glooms, And reigns tremendous o'er the conquer'd year. How dead the vegetable kingdom lies ! How dumb the tuneful!

Cold, it is known, renders bodies more compact, particularly the solid parts of the animal structure—such as the muscles, nerves, bones, &c.; in winter they become more elastic, the appetite for food is stronger, and digestion, if the organs necessary to this process be in good order, is always earned on easier and quicker. On the contrary, if the cold be too violent, the resistance offered by the fluids becomes so great, that even the increased power of the solids cannot overcome it. The blood, in winter, is much disposed to influence inflammatory diseases ; for example.

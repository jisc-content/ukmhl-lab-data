horticulture. AUGUST. The Kitchen-Garden— This is now a principal season for sowing and planting several autumnal and winter crops, and for next spring and summer; to which particular attention is required, as hereafter explained in the respective sorts: they will not admit of delay. As many early and general summer crops — will now be cleared oft', get the ground ready, by dunging and digging, for the reception of several principal crops requisite to put in at this season. As soon as the ground is digged—that intended for sow- ing in particular, if dry weather, generally sow directly while the earth is fresh turned up, and the surface a little moist; which now, if a dry season, will be of particular advantage in sowing. The sowing and planting now required, consists of the following sorts :— Sowing—must now be particularly attended to in several crops; especially cabbages, coleworts, cauliflowers, spi- nach, onions, lettuce, turnips, and carrots; some for autumn, but mostly to stand the winter, and for next spring; and some for early summer crops. Also sow some late pease, kidney-beans, (and radishes, for the present autumn; chervill, corn salad, bo- rage, angelica, fennel, alexanders, small salading, turnip- radish, and black Spanish radish. Planting — is now required in coleworts, cabbages, broccoli, savoys, celery, endive, leeks, lettuce, and some turnip-cabbage, &c. if in request. Pricking out—in young seedling plants, is required for broccoli, cabbages, coleworts, and celery. Cabbage plants—of the June and July sowing, plant out abundantly for la^e young cabbage, and cabbage coleworts for autumn and winter. Beans—plant (b.) for a Michaelmas crop, of the rnaza- gans, white blossoms, &c. in a south exposure: they will produce in the latter end of September, October, &c. Carrots — sow a small crop (b. m.), to come in for drawing young in the spring. In rainy or showery weather — take opportunity to sow,;

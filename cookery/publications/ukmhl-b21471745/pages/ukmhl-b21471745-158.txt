MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES, IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY, -MANUFACTURES, AND THE ARTS, &c. Armenian Cement. 1. Soak isinglass in water till soft, then dissolve it in proof spirit; add a little galbanum or gum ammoniac, and mix it with tincture of mastich. *#* It must be kept well stopped, and when wanted, liquefied by the phial being immersed in hot water. Used to cement jewels upon watch-cases; to mend china, or to replace leaves torn out of books. 2. Add tincture of lac in rectified spirit, to a solution of isinglass in the same solvent. 3. Add to melted glue, half its weight of rosin in powder, and some red ochre: this is used for coarser purposes, as for cementing hones to their frames. Bronzing Liquor. Blue vitriol dissolved in water, used to bronze tea-urns, &c.; the surface being previously well cleaned. Boyle's Fuming Liquor.—(Wine test). Take fresh burned lime, four ounces; water, two ounces; and lake; and when cold, add sal ammoniac, 4 ounces; flour of sulphur, two ounces; distil—used as a proof liquor for wine; but it requires the precipitate to be examined, by fusion, whether it be really lead. Fly Water. Take white arsenic, one drachm; water, one pint: dis- solve by boiling, and sweeten with treacle—used to destroy flies. *** A strong infusion is equally efficacious, and not attended with any danger. Green Sympathetic Ink. Saturate spirit of salt, or aqua regia, with zaffre, or cobalt ore, free from iron, and dilute with distilled water: what is drawn upon paper with this liquor will appear green when it is warm; and lose its colour again when cold, unless it has been heated too.much. Blue Sympathetic Ink. Dissolve cobalt or zaffre in spirit of nitre, precipitate by prepared kali, wash the precipitate, and dissolve it in distilled vinegar, avoiding an excess of the acid : to be used in the same manner as the last.

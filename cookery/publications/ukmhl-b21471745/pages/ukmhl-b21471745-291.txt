Qualifications of a Footman. " Any one, who is in the least acquainted with spruce- pines, will find the tree which I have distinguished by that name. There are three sorts of it; that which has the smallest leaves and deepest colour, is the sort we brewed with, but,, doubtless, all three might safely serve that purpose. The tea plant is a small tree or shrub, with five white petals, or flower-leaves, shaped like those of a rose, having smaller ones of the same figure in the intermediate spaces, and twenty or more filaments or threads. The tree sometimes grows to a moderate height, and is generally bare on the lower part, with a number of small branches growing close together towards the top. The leaves are small and pointed, like those of the myrtle; it bears a dry roundish seed case, and grows, commonly in dry places near the shores. The leaves, as I have already observed, were used by many of us as tea, which has a very agreeable bitter and flavour, when, they are recent, but loses some of both when they are dried. When the infusion was made strong, it proved emetic to some in the same manner as green tea." QUALIFICATIONS OF A FOOTMAN.

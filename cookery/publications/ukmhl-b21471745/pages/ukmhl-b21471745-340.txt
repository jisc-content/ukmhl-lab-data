324 A Bakers Way of Growing a Shoulder of Mutton. cheese, but take it out whole by means of a soil dish, and place it in a sieve to drain gradually, and as it drains, it should be pressed by degrees, until it becomes firm and dry ; then place it in a wooden hoop; afterwards to be kept on boards, turned frequently, with cloth binders round it, tightening them as occasion may re- quire. GERMAN MODE OF CURING HAMS. Tn Westphalia, hams are cured between November and March. The Germans pile them up in deep tubs, covering them with layers of salt, saltpetre, and a small quantity of bay leaves. Tn this situation they let them remain about four or five days, wrhen they make a strong pickle of salt and water, with which they cover them completely; and at the expiration of three weeks they take them out of pickle, soak them twelve hours in clean well-water, and hang them up for three weeks longer in a smoke made from the juniper bushes, which in that coun- try are abundantly met with. ECONOMY AND SAFETY IN MAKING SOAP. To thirty-two gallons of lye, of strength just suffi- cient to bear an egg, add sixteen pounds of clean melted grease, which, by being placed in the hot sun, and occasionally stirred, will in a few days, produce a soap of first quality. A BAKER'S WAY OF GROWING A SHOULDER OF MUTTON. Mr. Crust first buys the smallest shoulder of mutton which he can find; perhaps it may weigh about four pounds. When his Sunday's dishes come in (which, if he be in any thing of a trade, will be pretty numerous), he changes this four-pound shoulder of mutton for a five- pounder; then he removes the five-pound shoulder to the place of a six; then substitutes a seven, and so oh to eight, nine, and ten ! Thus he makes a clear gain of six pounds of mutton, and changes his four pounds of carrion for prime meat! Puddings are done differently.

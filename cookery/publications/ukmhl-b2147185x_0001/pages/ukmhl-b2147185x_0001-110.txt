There is no want of economy in the strictest sense of the word in giving broken victiuils to the poor, provided we know they eat them. Want of economy is exemplified in giving a haJL picked sirloin of beef-bone to the dog, in throwing the end in the pig-tub, or in leaving the ends of mutton chops juid the bones half picked on tlie plate. Again, a fruitful source of waste, which is in reality a synonymous term for want of economy, is allowing, through carelessness, ignorance, or want of fore- thought, food of any description to get bad. For instance, forgetting in liot weather to waiun up soup when it has been left, but is not required for the next day's consumption : or in leaving in sultry weather a joint of meat all night in a hot place, instead of preserving it by placing it in a cool larder or ice-chest. Again, milk can often be preserved from turning sour for one night by the simple plan of boiling it, and pouring it into a clean jug. These and a hundred other riimple methods by which food can be preserved, and thereby added to the wealth of the country, are principles of education that ought to form part of all elementary lessons now taught in schools. There is perhaps nothing that would so effect the future prosperity and greatness of our country than universally inculcating in the minds of the yoxing throughout the length and breadth of the land the importance of economy of the necessaries of life. Our present teachers of the young have high responsibilities. It is not so much that a great multitude follow them as that a great multitude are driven unto them. Whatever differences may arise as to creed or no creed, surely all will unite in agreeing with the great Teacher that it is our duty to gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

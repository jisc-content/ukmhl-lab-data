SOUPS, BROTHS, PUREES. 24 Directions. 1. Put the stock in a saucepan. 2. Scrape the lean beef into the stock, or run it through a mincing-machine; cut up the vegetables small, and add them also and the pepper-corns and herbs. 3. Whisk the stock over the fire until it is on the point of boiling; then take the whisk out, and allow the soup to boil. Draw to the side of the fire, and allow to stand for twenty minutes to half an hour. 4. Strain carefully through a thick cloth two or three times, not removing the scum in the cloth each time, as it helps to clear the soup as it goes through it. 5. The soup should he clear and bright as pale sherry. N.B.â€”This soup can be varied very considerably, and is named according to what is served in it. In speaking of different clear soups, I shall refer to this receipt, and simply give directions for preparing the various things to be served in them.

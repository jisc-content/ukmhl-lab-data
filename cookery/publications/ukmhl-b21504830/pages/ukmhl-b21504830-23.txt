SOUPS, BROTHS, PUREES. 23 for soup if raw meat is used the proportion should be half a pound of raw beef to every two pounds of meat and bones used to make the stock ; if white of eggs is used two whites and the crushed shells of two eggs should be used to clear a quart of stock which has presumably been made from two pounds of bone and meat. For beef-tea the proportion of beef to water on the other hand, is one pound to one pint or equal weights. Nothing is gained by making beef-tea weak, water can always be added after it is made if quantity is preferred to quality. Beef-tea should never boil, but be cooked like a custard in a jar standing in boiling water. Clear Soup. Enough for Six Persons. Ingredients. Average cost. s. d. 3Â£-pints of stock .

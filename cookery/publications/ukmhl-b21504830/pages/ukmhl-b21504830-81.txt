It ex- plains, in the simplest possible manner, the distinctions no only between the various styles of architecture, but between the different styles of ornamentation; and in every case there is a small illustration which cannot fail to fix in the mind the dis- tinctions of which the authoress has been talking.”—Scotsman.

When the water gets hot put in a little salt, not enough to make it taste salt, hut only enough to cause the scum to rise, which it will do when the stock boils, and must be carefully skimmed off. 5. Cut the vegetables into dice and, with the herbs and pepper-corns, throw into the stock-pot when the liquor boils. 6. Allow the whole to simmer gently for six or seven hours (not longer), every now and then adding a tablespoonful of cold water to cause the scum to rise, which must be at once taken off. 7. At the end of seven hours the stock should be strained into a clean basin and allowed to stand un- covered in a cool place to get quite cold, when the fat can be skimmed off the surface. The vegetables must on no account be allowed to remain all night in stock, as they are likely to turn it sour. 8. When the fat has been taken carefully from the top of the stock it is ready for use, and can be con- verted into any clear soup, thick brown soup, or pur6e that is required.

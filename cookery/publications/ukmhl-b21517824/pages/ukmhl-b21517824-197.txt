175 GENTLE SPEECH. because then the lungs are squeezed together, and they cannot hold all the air that is necessary. Children who live with people who are gentle and speak softly, learn to speak softly too. It is true that some voices are sweeter than others ; but every voice can be trained to give out pleasant tones. Angry tones spoil the delicate vocal cords, and put them out of tune, and by the time a child has grown up their sweetness has gone for ever.

Poor little creature, I thought; after nil your evil training and hard life, your little heart is softer than the matron's. A kind heart, gentle manner and voice, are to my mind indispensable qualifications in those who undertake the care

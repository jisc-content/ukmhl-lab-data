THE NERVES AND THE SENSE OE HEARING. To-dat I am going to explain the organ of hearing. Before I do so I must tell you a little more abont the nerves. They may be compared to the springs in a watch. When a watch- maker has made all the wonderful parts or organs of a watch, they would not move unless he put some springs which keep the organs going. Our nerves are the springs which are fastened to all our muscles, and by this means our limbs are made to move. Those nerves that spread through our bodies come out from the spinal cord, which passes down the backbone, or spinal column. There are, you know, twenty-nine bones in the spine. At every joint a pair of nerves come out, one on each side of the spine between the vertebrae. These nerves spread out all over the body like a fine white network. Look at this diagram (page 67),1 and you will see them. In this picture of the spinal column (page 66) 2 you may see how they come out between each pair of vertebras. Each spinal nerve is really made up of two sets of cords wrapped up side by side in a sort of sheath. One set of these cords forms the nerve of feeling, the other the nerve of motion. The spinal cord, you know, is also connected with the brain. When anything happens to the outside of the body, the nerve of feeling takes the news of it up to the brain; and then the nerve of motion carries back directions what to do, and puts our limbs into action. For instance, if you put your hand on anything hot, the nerve of feeling in the hand sends a message up to the brain to say that touching this hot thing hurts your hand. If it is burning hot, the brain sends back a message by the nerve of . 1 Marshall's diagram, No. 7. 2 %hul<

THE HORSE'S HOOF. 75 There are knives made on purpose to shave off some of the frog, or soft cushion ; then the horse, having nothing to pro- tect the tender sole, becomes lame. Cracked heels are often caused by cutting away the little tuft of hair that is placed at the back of the foot to guard that part. Exercise is necessary for horses; the feet are very much injured by standing still in a hot, damp stable. The feet then grow tender, and the frog and horny sole grow smaller, so that the nerves and blood-vessels get squeezed together, and grow small and weak. The donkey's foot is very like the horse's; the only difference is, that the donkey's hoof is longer and the sole more hollow. It is by this means that it can walk in rough and steep places better than the horse, because its hoof digs into the earth, and gets a better hold of it. Things provided fur the Lecture.

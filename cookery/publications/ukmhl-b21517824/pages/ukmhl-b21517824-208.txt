THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. lsii You must read all the books you can find on natural history. I have written down the names of some, which your masters and mistresses will lend you. When your parents have a holiday, I hope they will often take you to the Museum, for then you will be able to tell them all you know about the collection of animals you will see there. I am very sorry to say good-bye to you, for you have all been so polite and atten- tive that I have looked forward with great pleasure to seeing you every week. In a few years you will all be gaining your livelihood in different waysâ€”as labourers and artisans, teachers, nurses, cooks, grooms, butchers, and emigrants; and some of you may become rich men, and become masters your- selves. Whatever your calling in life may be, I hope the information you have gained during the last five months may prove valuable to you. I have desired above all things to prove to you that, owing to our ignorance, we bring upon ourselves and those about us a great deal of the sickness, sorrow, and suffering which spoil this beautiful world. It is therefore our first duty to study and understand the laws of God, to obey them, and to be just, kind, and humane to all He has created, especially to young children and dumb ani- mals, who are weak and defenceless, and depend upon us for protection and care.

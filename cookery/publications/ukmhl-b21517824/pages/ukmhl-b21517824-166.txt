COOKIXC. 1II that when I nursed a friend who had a dreadful attack of gout, his pain was always relieved,when I gave him a hot cup of coffee and hot milk in the middle of the night. Remember the milk should always be made very hot that is taken with coffee. Milk should never be boiled, because the albumen gets hardened and rises to the top, and makes the skin you have often seen on the top of a cup of milk. Now we are going to learn about cocoa and chocolate. Perhaps you do not know they are both made from exactly the same kernel of the tree called Theobroma cacao, which grows in America and the West Indies. Chocolate and cocoa are prepared in a great many ways. Cocoa or chocolate is very good for people who can eat fat food, such as children and young people, but it does not suit all bilious people. One pound of cocoa or chocolate contains :— oz. UHAIXS Water 0 350 Albumen, or Gluten 3 85 Theobromine 1 140 Cocoa Butter 8 0 Gum . . .

Cocoa ought to be cooked gently and allowed to simmer for half-an-hour or more, and have a great deal of milk, which should simmer with it. It is a great pity mill-girls do not take it instead of tea. Cocoa-nibs ought to simmer for two or tlrree hours; they cannot be done well in less time. Things provided for the Lecture. A glass bottle of soup made of vegetables, like the soup we made at the lesson for the children to taste. Two pints of water, two oz. green peas, a cold potato, one tablcspoonful of flour, two oz. of dripping, half a teaspoonful of sugar, pepper, salt. One gill of milk.

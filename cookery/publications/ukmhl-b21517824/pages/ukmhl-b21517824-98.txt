DIGESTION. 76 LECTURE X. DIGESTION. To-DAY we arc going to hear about the \v;iy in which the food we eat is digested—that means, how it is changed by the different organs of digestion, and made into blood. I will first point out where some of the largest organs of digestion are placed in this part of the body called the abdo- men. The abdomen is separated from the chest by a large muscle called the diaphragm.1 Here is the stomach, lying nearly in the middle, close under the ' diaphragm.' The liver is above and to the right of the stomach, and the intestines, or bowels, are beneath the stomach. This muscle called the diaphragm is a very important part, and I will try and explain how curiously it moves. When you take in a deep breath of air, your ribs swell out, and so do the lungs. The diaphragm, instead of rising up at the same time that the ribs do, sinks down, and so makes room for the lungs to grow as big as they can. Draw in a good breath, and you will see that this is the case. Our blood, as I have before said, contains at least forty different substances. The food is first changed in the mouth. The mouth is a strong box of bone which contains the tongue and tbirty-two teeth, sixteen at the top and sixteen at the bottom. A learned man. would at least give you one lesson entirely about teeth. I can only tell you enough about them to make you understand that God has given us different kinds of teeth, so that we may be able to eat both animal and vegetable food. Animals which live on nothing but flesh—that is, by eating other animals—have very different teeth from those who eat nothing but grass. I have brought the skull of a lion. A lion, you know, eats nothing but animal food. Tou see he has four enormous teeth, two on each jaw, called canine teeth, for holding the prey, besides numerous molar teeth. Between these canine teeth the flesh is caught and pierced and torn, 1 Marshall's diagram, No. 3, page 4.

125 VEGETABLE COOKING. are cooked. For instance, if you tried to eat a piece of raw beef, you would find it had a very different flavour from that of the roast beef you eat on Christmas Day. A raw potato does not taste at all like a boiled one. In every kind of food there is a substance that makes that particular food taste unlike any other food. The flavouring matter that is in butcher's meat, poultry, and game is called by a long nameâ€”osmazome. Like all flavouring matter it is very delicate and is injured by great heat. We eat fruits and salad uncooked because we find their flavour is spoilt when they are boiled. If you look at the food table you will see that some vegetables take a longer time to digest than animal food. I believe they would digest much more quickly if we understood how to cook them properly. Hours to Digest One Pound of Hours to Digest One Pound of 3 Meat. 3* Bread. Cheese.

You see that a roasted potato only takes two hours to digest, a boiled potato three hours and a half. One reason, I think, is because the roasted potato has lost none of its salts, as it does when it is boiled. The salts and juices all help digestion. Here is the picture of a slice of a potato. You see that the starch grains are held between cells or spaces, which look like a network. The substance that makes that network is chiefly cellulose gluten. In young potatoes, and particularly in all young fruit and vegetables, there is a great deal more of this network, which is called cellular tissue. Animal foods contain a cellular tissue, which forms a sort of framework in the organ, but it is not like the vegetable tissue, as it gives gluten when it is boiled. One reason why we cook food is

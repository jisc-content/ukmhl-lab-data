A fall-grown man requires daily 10 oz. of body-warmers and 5 oz. of flesh-formers. Water and ashes are not in- cluded in these quantities. These 15 oz. of solid food can be got either from animal or vegetable food. But some vegetables contain a smaller proportion of solid matter, be- cause they have so much more water; we must therefore eat more of them. They take a longer time to digest than meat. You see that a working-man, it is said, ought to eat 10 oz. of carbonaceous food daily, and only 5 oz. of flesh- formers. It is also said that 7 oz. of that food will be burnt in his body in 24 hours. That means that the carbon in these foods will join chemically with the oxygen in his body, and make the heat, strength, or force (for they are the same thing) he wants. Scientific men can tell how much fat will be burnt in a man's body when he lifts a heavy weight from the ground. The harder a man works, and the hotter he grows, the more fat he burns. He will not burn all the ten ounces of carbonaceous foods he eats in the day. Three ounces of the fat must be kept to lie between his muscles and cover his bones. Animal carbonaceous foods, such as suet, butter, and all animal fats, are stronger body-warmers than vegetable fats or oils, because they contain more carbon. These animal fats are therefore the best kind for a working-man to eat who works out in the fresh air, where he will get plenty of oxygen gas. People who take very little exercise should be careful not to eat much carbonaceous food, or they will become fat. There was a French baker who grew to be- so enormously fat that he did not like to go out of doors, because people stared at

THE TBBATMENT OF ANIMALS. 1*2 that a law was made to forbid their being killed at certain times. So far I have only told you about animals which have a backbone and a bony skull, called vertebrate animals. I am now going- to tell you a little about the four types of animals that have neither a backbone nor a bony skull, called Inver- tebrate. Here are pictures of them, represented by a lobster, an oyster, a starfish, and an amoeba. First there is the lobster ; you see it has neither a back- bone nor a bony skull. It has a great many legs that are all jointed. A bee has the same kind of body and legs. All insects—such as the bee, butterfly, cockchafer, grasshopper, Fig. 39. An Insect. or flea—arc made in the same way, and arc called jointed-ani- mals, as they have a number of joints. We owe a great deal to insects. For instance, there is the honey we get from bees. All poor people who live in the country ought to keep bee- hives. In an answer which I received from one of you it was said that only animals which have a backbone and a bony skull had nerves and could feel pain. This picture (fig. 39) will show you that even an insect has nerves which spread all over its body, so that it must be capable of feeling pain. Here is the picture of an oyster, which represents the second type of animals without a backbone and a bony skull. They have soft bodies, nerves, and several organs.

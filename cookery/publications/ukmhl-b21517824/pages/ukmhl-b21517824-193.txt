171 UA1N AND SPKINGS. care you never drink water out of a well which is placed near a large town, a drain, or a churchyard, for sometimes the dead organic matter from the churchyard and the poisonous gases get into it. This happened in London at the time of the cholera, twenty years ago. The water of a well in Golden Square looked so bright and sparkling that the people thought it must be very pure water. When Dr. Lankester examined it he found a kind of fungus or ye^st plant growing in it, and a great deal of dead organic matter that had come from the churchyard. It was shown that all the people who drank water out of this well suffered from cholera. Whenever you have the least fear that water is not pure, boil it well. A filter only cleans the water; it cannot kill any germs. Nothing but boiling water will kill them. Before I conclude my lecture I will just wind up this orrery; it goes by clockwork. Our earth turns quite round on its own axis in twenty-four hours. That half of the earth which is turned towards the sun will have daylight; the other half which is turned away will be in the dark, and therefore it will be night. You also see that our earth moves round the sun. As we look into the sky it seems as if the sun moved round the earth. We are all taught at school to say that the sun rises and the sun sets; but this is an untrue statement, and mis- leads children very much. It is the earth we live on that may be said to rise and set, because it turns round so as to present any given part to the sun, and then from the sun once in every twenty-four hours. I was very anxious to bring this orrery on purpose to make you understand this fact. Things provided for the Lecture. An orrery. Auzoux's papier-mache model of the eye.

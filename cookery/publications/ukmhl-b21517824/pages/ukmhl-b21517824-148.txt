The grains in the many-sided spaces or cells are starch grains ; the network that holds them is called cellular tissue. you must be curious to know with what degree of heat you are to cook, as I have told you never to cook meat or vegetables in boiling water. You see I have written down this information, and you must copy it carefully, as it is very important you should be able to remember it when you have to cook for yourselves. Every kind of animal and vegetable nitrogenous food will be thoroughly well cooked if allowed to remain long enough in water that is at 180°. The albumen becomes solid at that heat, but it will become hard and less easily digestible, like the albumen in a hard-boiled egg, if it is cooked in boiling water, which requires a temperature of 212°. I am now going to show you how to boil a potato. Re- member, if you know how to cook a potato, you will know how to boil any fresh green vegetable. First of all, the potato must be nicely washed in cold water, as this has been. Next you must take out all the earth that rests in the little holes. Some people use a knife to do this, but a knife may cut the skin. A brush, such as our cook has in her hand, is much better.

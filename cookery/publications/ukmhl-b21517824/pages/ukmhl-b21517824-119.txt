THE LIVER. 97 digested in the stomach; it is digested in the intestine called the duodenum. If there is not bile enough there to change the fat into a soapy substance, the fat remains in the liver. There is a most expensive dish sold in Germany called pate de foie c/ras, the English of which is ' patty of fat liver.' I will tell you how it is made. A live goose is fastened down to a boai'd, arid put very near a fire or stove. It is fed on oily food, and it is allowed no fresh air or exercise. After a time its liver grows big and fat and diseased. Then the poor goose is killed, and the liver is made into a pie, or potted. A small pot is sold for three or four shillings, and is con- sidered a great treat. I am very glad to say that this dish, which is so cruelly procured, is most indigestible stuff. Doctors say that plenty of fresh air and exercise is the best way to prevent biliousness. Good water helps the liver to make bile. Footmen—gentlemen's servants who live in grand houses, sit a great deal in warm rooms, eat rich, fat food, drink beer instead of water, and do very little work such as strong men ought to do—suffer veiy much from liver complaints. There is a dreadful complaint called a nutmeg liver. The liver all shrinks up and becomes like a nutmeg. This is the kind of liver a man has who drinks spirits; this is called a drunkard's liver.1 I will tell you in the next lecture the bad effect that spirits have upon the liver.

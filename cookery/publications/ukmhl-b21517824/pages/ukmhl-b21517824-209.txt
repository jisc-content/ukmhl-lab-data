APPENDICES. APPENDIX I. The contents of this Appendix were printed in the form of a little tract, a copy of which was given to every scholar who attended my lectures. My hearers were thus enabled to recall some of the facts on which I had laid special stress. The information here given will be found in an expanded form in the lectures which treat of food and cooking ; but the tract is reprinted in the hope that it may suggest to any ladies who may undertake the same work a simple method of communicating important knowledge. I may add that the tract was gratefully received, and those who were not present eagerly sent to ask me for copies. FOOD TABLE. A human body which weighs 154 lbs., or 11 stones, ought to have about— 111 lbs. of vater—90 lbs. of this water is oxygen, the rest is hydro- gen. 12 lbs. of fat (body-warmer). 24^- lbs. of albumen and fibrin (flesh-formers). 5§ lbs. of phosphate of lime. \ lb. of soda, potash, and magnesia ashes. Oxygen is the chief means by which the food we eat is changed into at least 40 different substances to nourish our different organs. When we are in health the active parts of these organs ought to be completely changed in about 40 days. When oxygen meets with car bon in any one of the 40 substances mentioned, and combines with it in the body, heat is formed. Oxygen purifies the blood.

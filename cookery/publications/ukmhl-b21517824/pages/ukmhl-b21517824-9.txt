PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. It is now six months since this little book was first issued, and in that time it has attained a success beyond my most sanguine expectations. In preparing this new edition I have availed myself of the criticisms sent me by several of the scientific men whose books I studied, and I have also benefited by reading the numerous reviews which have appeared. I am glad to be permitted to mention that Mr. Marshall, E.R.S., Avho kindly gave me his advice during the revision of the original manuscript, has rendered me still further indebted to him by carefully reading through the book for the purpose of this edition ; and by these means it has, I hope, been much improved. The present edition is published in a cheaper form, in accordance with numerous suggestions which have been made to me for extending its influence. I hope that my Lectures will, therefore, now come within the reach of those for whom they were originally written. CATHERINE M. BUCKTON. 4 Moorland Tkurack: Feb. 4th, 1876.

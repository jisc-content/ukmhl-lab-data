When the mind is troubled and weakened, all the organs become weakened too. It has often happened that a person who was just going to sit down to a good dinner received bad news. Instantly after hearing such news even the smell and sight of the good things became disagreeable to him. This is the reason why people grow thin when they are unhappy. They lose their appetite and cannot eat. When our minds are troubled, and we are unhappy, riches and ease bring us no comfort. The only way to cure unhappiness is to work.

You know there is a nerve in every one of our teeth, Little children who live in bad air suffer dreadfully

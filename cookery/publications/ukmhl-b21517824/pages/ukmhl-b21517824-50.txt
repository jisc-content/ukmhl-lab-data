This joint-oil makes the movement between the bones more easy. Each of our fingers has three joints. The thumb has only two joints, as you can sec, if you look at your hands. We have twenty-seven bones in each of our hands. When a Fig. 10.

The top bone of the arm fits into the shoulder-blade, and forms what is called the cup-and-ball joint. There is a good deal of joint-oil in the bag that covers the top of these bones. It is easy to pull the ball out of tho cup, and this accident often happens to little children. It is

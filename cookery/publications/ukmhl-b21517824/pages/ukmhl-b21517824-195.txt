173 THE LARYNX. I will now explain to you how we are able to make our two strings either short or long. I told you that the box, or larynx, across which the two vocal cords are placed is made up chiefly of muscles and cartilages. Some of these muscles are fastened to the cartilages and to the vocal cords, and they can draw the vocal cords out and so make them long, or shorten them by pulling them in, just in the same way that the cords or strings of a harp can be made tight or loose by turning these screws. When we sing a high note we stretch out our throats and hold up our chins ; by that means we help to tighten or Fig. 36. View of the larynx, as if you were looking down through the mouth into the windpipe. The back of the larynx, or musical box, is that part marked b ; the pointed part comes to the front of the throat, and is called Adam's apple a. 7 and (! are two cords called the vocal cords ; between these two cords there is an opening called the glottis g. It is through this hole that the air enters and passes out from the lungs. The muscles that are in the larynx make the vocal cords come close together or draw them apart, make them loose or tight. screw up and shorten the cords. Look at a little bird when it is singing high notes, or a cock when it is crowing, and you will also see how much they stretch out their throats. A woman who is singing a high note or scolding some one across a room or street does just the same thing. When we speak low, we let our chins fall; the cords then become longer, and the opening between them is larger. When we play on a harp or fiddle we strike the strings with our fingers to make them shake or vibrate, and then a sound comes from them. What strikes against our vocal cords ? It is the air, as it comes out of our lungs, that strikes against them and makes them shake or vibrate, and cause a sound. The air does not make the cords vibrate as it goes into the mouth, for while we are taking in air and filling our

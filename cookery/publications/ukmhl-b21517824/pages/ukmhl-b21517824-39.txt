THE SKELETON. 17 S. It' a room were full of steam, how would you send it out? 4. How would you bring fresh air into a room and send the had air out; that means, ventilate a room? 5. Why did people have dreadful fevers and the plague 200 years ago ? Experiments. Pour some of the solution of permanganate of potash into pure water; the purple colour will remain bright. Pour some into the bottle containing organic matter; the colour will be changed to a dirty yellow. Fill a bottle with water and place it with its mouth downwards on a stand in a tub of water.

I will try to-day to make you understand why good air is equally necessary for dumb animals. Horses, cows, shcop, dogs, birds, and all animals except man were made to live night and day in the G

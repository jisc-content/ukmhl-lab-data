INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 185 is broken. The limbs sometimes move, but the animal is quite unconscious. Ignorant people will always be superstitiousâ€”that is, believe any silly thing that they hear. A gentleman not long ago saw a crowd of people on Hounslow Heath collected round a snake which two men were beating. He asked them why they did not kill the poor creature at once. ' We are snake-killers,' they said, ' and know all about it; it would be no use to try and kill a snake before the sun goes down.' ' Give me the stick,' said the gentleman, ' and I will show you that the sun has nothing to do with it.' With this he hit the snake Fig, 42. Amelia. a hard blow on the back of its neck, just where the head joins the spine. The body of the snake continued to wriggle about; and though the gentleman knew that the animal could no longer feel, and would soon cease to move, still, to satisfy the crowd, he struck the snake all down the spine ; after doing this it was still, and they were satisfied that it was dead. It is dreadful to think of the cruelty that goes on in slaughter-houses. Some butchers think it is unnecessary to give food and drink to animals who are going to be killed in a day or two, or to keep them in clean stables. We pay very dearly for this cruelty, because the meat of animals so treated is not good. Ignorance and cruelty are very extravagant things. I do not wonder people become vegetarians when they know all that animals have to endure from long journeys and brutal drovers, before they are slaughtered by ignorant and cruel butchers, or their lads.

COOKING {concluded). I have told you that the food we eat must be of different kinds—animal, vegetable, and mineral. We will read what is written on this sheet and see what it tells us about animals and plants. A germ is the beginning of life in all plants and animals. Plants have organs ; animals have organs. They are both made of organic matter. Both germs contain exactly the same substances—oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Tou all by this time understand that animals have organs, but I do not think you all know that plants have organs. An organ is an instrument or a place where something is done. I will now show you that plants have organs. I hold in my hand a young potato-plant; here are the potatoes, the leaves, the stems, and the roots. It has just been taken out of the earth. You see there is some earth sticking to these little roots. These roots, which look like fine little white threads, go down into the earth and suck out of it the water and mineral substances upon which the plant lives. These little roots are little pipes, and carry the water and minerals up into the stems and then into the leaves, and to every part of the plant to feed it, just as our blood is carried to every part of the body by the arteries.

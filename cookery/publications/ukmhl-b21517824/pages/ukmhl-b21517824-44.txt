If you were to see the skull of a baby, you would be able to find out where the bones join, and you could see how curiously many of them fit into each other, like two saws that joiners use to saw wood with. These bones are either gristly or membranous for some time ; at about four years of age they become firm; at seven they are quite hard and well joined together.

A bit of brain grows every day, and then just enough bone grows to cover the new brain ; this is the reason why the bones of the skull are neither hard nor joined together when it is born. You will always find there is a wise reason for all the changes that take place as we grow older. I dare say you have heard of the North American Indians.

Our red corpuscles are round like a sixpence, but they are pressed down in the middle like an air-cushion. You can see them on this diagram.1 The white corpuscles are much less numerous. I must take care to let you know how very small these little bodies are. You must remember they have to pass through those little hair-like tubes called capillaries, which are so tine that they cannot be seen without very powerful magnifying glasses. In a drop of blood there would be, it is said, about three million corpuscles —the same number as there are people in London, which is the largest city in the world.

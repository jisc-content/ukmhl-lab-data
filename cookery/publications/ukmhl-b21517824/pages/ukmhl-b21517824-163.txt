141 A STW. see that the water or gravy which the meat is put into is boiling. The meat must then be stewed for a long time in a moderately hot oven. Tough meat should always be stewed. The following is the most simple receipt I know for stewing a beef steak or any meat in a way that would suit an invalid with a delicate stomach :— Take off all the fat and skin from a rump steak nearly an inch thick ; just dip it into boiling water, sprinkle a little pepper, and then flour it on both sides rather thickly. Wash out the stew-pot with boiling water: put in the meat with about a tablespoonful of water, and let it stew gently until it is tender.

As there is an immense quantity of tea drunk in England by both rich and poor, I am going to tell you the good and the harm it does to our health. Here is a list of the sub- stances there are in tea. In one pound of tea are to be found the following sub- stances : — 07..

The volatile oil gives the flavour of tea. The latter, like all flavouring matter, is a most delicate substance, and would all fly away if the tea were boiled. This is the reason why we only pour boiling water on tea when we make it. Theine has a great effect upon the nerves ; for this reason, when tea is taken very strong, it often keeps people awake the whole night. Tannic acid, which you see the tea contains, is the same stuff which tanners use to tan leather. This acid hardens albumen

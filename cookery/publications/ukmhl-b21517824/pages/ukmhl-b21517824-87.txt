You can see two small nerves that look like threads come out between the bones on both sides of the spine, in the neck, back, and loins. There are thirty-one pairs of nerves; they spread out like a fine network and reach every spot in the body.1 When you prick yourself with a pin it causes you pain, because the needle has touched a nerve. We have two skins. This outer one has no nerves in it, as you will find by rubbing it, or by Fig. 21.

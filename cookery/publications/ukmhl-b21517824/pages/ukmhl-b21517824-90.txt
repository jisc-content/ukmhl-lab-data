The sense of touch is so delicate in the tips of the lingers that blind people have been known to distinguish differently coloured materials, and to do many very wonderful things, by the sense of touch. Fig. 24. This diagram shows the different shapes of some of the bones that are joined together and make the backbone; or spine. Each of these bones is called a vertebra, a and b are the same bone, only a is seen sideways and 6 ft-om the top ; it is one of the seven bones that make the neck, c and d, seen in the same way, represent a vertebra taken from the middle of the backbone, e and /, seen in the same way, show a verteb a from the middle part of the loin. The pointed partthatstands out in all the bones is placed outside ; the round smooth part lies inside the body, as will be seen by looking at fig. 9. page 27.

The elephant is the most sagacious of quadrupeds ; the end of its trunk is so sensitive that it can feel and handle objects almost as well as we can. All animals which have a bony or cartilaginous skull have brains and a backbone, or vertebral column. It is called a vertebral column because each of these little bones by which it is made is called a vertebra.1 All animals which have a 1 I showed two or three of these bones.

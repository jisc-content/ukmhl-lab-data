THE CIRCULATION. 30 LECTURE V. THE CIRCULATION. Before I begin to describe the circulation of the blood I should like you to understand what an organ is. No doubt you have often heard people speak of the organs of the body. An organ is an instrument which does something. The organ of the body I am going to tell you about to-day is the heart.1 I have brought you the same beautiful model of one which I had at my first lecture. This wonderful little organ, or instrument, has to do a very great deal of hard work, as you will think, I am sure, when I tell you that it sends blood to every part of our body in about half a minute. We have at least forty organs, or places, in the body where something is done, and the active part of each of these forty organs ought to be entirely re-made in about forty days. The forty different organs are made of different substances. Our blood also contains at least forty different substances. I have in these bottles some of those substances. I have chosen a few whose names you will all know—salt, soda, fat and other substances rich in sugar, iron, lime, phosphorus, albumen, and carbon. Perhaps you have never heard before the name of the last substance. I shall have a great deal to tell you about carbon in all my lectures. Charcoal is almost pure car- bon. I have written on this sheet that coal, fat, sugar, starch, all contain a great quantity of carbon. The purest carbon is the diamond. The ring I have on my finger is made of pure carbon, because it is a diamond. If I were to put my ring into a very hot furnace indeed, it would burn as a piece of coal or fat will. It is mixed with no other substance; and for that reason it is called an element, which means that it is made of only one thing. Carbonic acid gas sounds a little like car- bon, but they are very different things, as you will soon learn. Our bones are surrounded by two things—flesh and fat. 1 Here I showed Auzoux's model.

bo LECTURE IX. THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. The first part of my lecture to-day will be tipon the brain, which lies in the skull, and also about the nerves, which conic from the brain. I shall tell you more about the nerves when I tell you about the senses. The skull, you know, is a very strong box made of twenty- two bones, which are fixed together in the form of an arch above, as you see in this picture of a human skull. It rests on the top of the spine, or backbone. Here is a picture of the top part of the brain; you see it is divided into two equal parts. These two divisions are called the big brain. They may well be called the big brain, because they fill up the forehead, and the top of the head, and extend to the back of the skull. The proper name for this part is the cerebrum. You would not think, by looking at the picture of the big brain, that it is only one mass of brain, but it is possible to take the big brain and make it lie flat in one whole piece. I will just try and crumple up my pocket-handkerchief into folds, to try and make you understand why the brain appears as it does. These folds are called convolutions. A doctor could tell you a great deal about them. It is said that clever people have a great many more convolutions than stupid people. If you were to pinch or press the big brain you would cause no paiu, as it contains no nerves of feeling; but a Uoiv would do it great injury, because it would take away all power of memory and thought. You know how a blow or a fall on the head will stun either a human being: or a dumb animal, so that it forgets for a time all that has happened. A sailor once fell from the rigging of a ship on to the deck, and was taken up insensible. He remained insensible for several months at a hospital in Gibraltar. Apparently his body was healthy all the time, for he ate and drank and slept well; the only motion observed was the constant moving of his fingers,

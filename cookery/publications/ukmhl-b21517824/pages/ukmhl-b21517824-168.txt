146 COOKING. There are thousands of little holes, or pores, in every leaf, like the pores in our skin. If you had a microscope, you" could see them: remember they are generally found on the Yeast Plant.1 Amoeba—the most simple form of animal life. under side of the leaf. Plants are said to breathe through these boles. They take in one kind of gas and send out another, as we do through our mouths. You will be surprised to hear that they take in carbonic acid gas, and they send out into the air oxygen gas. If plants did not make use of carbonic acid gas, we and all dumb animals should soon be poisoned, because the air we breathe would become quite full of it. The Almighty allows nothing to be wasted; He has good use for everything He has made. You see that plants have organs, for I have just named three—the roots, stems, and the pores that cover principally the under part of the leaf. I should like to tell you a great deal about plants, as they are so wonderfully and beautifully made. I should like you all to have window-gardens, as children have in London, and receive prizes for the boxes of flowers that have been most carefully nursed. They require great care and soon die if they are not watered. When any part of a plant dies, it turns to corruption, just as the dead part of an animal would ; and while it is dying, it gives off very poisonous gases. At last it returns into oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon; these are the four substances that both animal and vegetable germs are made of. 1 It must be remembered that these figures represeut the objects very much magnified.

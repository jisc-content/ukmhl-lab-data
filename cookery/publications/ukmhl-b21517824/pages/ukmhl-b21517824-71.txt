49 LECTURE VII. BESPIRA TION. I am going to-day to explain how the heat in otir bodies is made, and how the blood is cleaned in the lungs. I told you that charcoal is nearly pure carbon, and that fat contains a large quantity of it. Here is some charcoal in this bottle; you see it is a black substance. I have a candle here; there is a great deal of fat all round the wick. The wick of a candle is only made of cotton. I Avill now tuni some of the fat which is in the candle into carbonâ€”a black substance. I must have heat first, or I could not make the candle change at all: nothing can be changed without heat. You must all of you remember this. The candle is now lighted and very hot, and I will hold a white plate over the top of it, and you will see that the plate will become very black. If I held it long enough all the candle would have burnt away, and I should have a great deal of this black substance. You will say that that black stuff is only smoke, the same that comes from all the chimneys in Leeds when coal is burnt; and so it is exactly the same substance as the smoke and the soot that sweeps come and carry away in lai'ge sacks when they have swept our chimneys. It is very wrong that so much carbon should be wasted, for it is not at all necessary. A careful engine-driver will not allow any smoke to come out of his chimney;*he burns every bit of coal he puts on his fire. Watch and see the next engine that is passing by, and you will find that only steam, which is water turned into gas or vapour, not smoke, comes out of the chimney. What a plea- sant town Leeds would be if we had no smoke ! We should be more healthy, and also save our money as well as use less coal. Coal, it is said, is growing very scarce. I have a spirit-lamp here. Pure spirit contains only a little carbon. You see the wick of this lamp is much larger than the wick of a candle. You will find when I light it, that the wick will not grow black like the wick of a candle, nor E

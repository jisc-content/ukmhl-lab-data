I have still something more to say about the skull. Under this bony covering there is a tough membrane ;1 beneath this is a very thin, smooth, moist membrane, and underneath this is the brain, which is itself closely covered by a third membrane, chiefly composed of blood-vessels. The skull is covered by the skin, on which the hair grows; under this are muscles and tendons, and under these is a membrane which is closely connected with the bones. I am very anxious you should understand and remember that the bones of the head and their coverings afford a very good protection to the brain, because some mothers and nurses who have unfortunately never been taught physiology say that it is dangerous to wash a baby's head, because, if you do, the water will cer- tainly run through into the brain, and give the child the disease called water on the brain. You will now understand • A membrane is a kind of skin.

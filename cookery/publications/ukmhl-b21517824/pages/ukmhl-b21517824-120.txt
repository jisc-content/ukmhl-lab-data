What is the name of the gas that must be in all foods called 'flesh- formers,' which make our forty organs and strengthen our muscles and nerves ? 4. When we drink anything, through what organ must that drink pass? 5. Why do drunkards and footmen suffer very much from liver com- plaints ? LECTURE XIV. NITROGENOUS AND LIQUID FOODS, AND THE HARM SPIRITS DO TO OUR ORGANS. My lecture to-day will again be about liquid foods. I had better mention that I am not a pledged teetotaller. I do not take wine or any stimulants, because I think it is not right to do so, as I am strong and well. I shall now try to explain some of the harm that spirits do to our organs, and to that substance which feeds our nerves called ' albumen.' Great heat also injures albumeu. For instance, here is an egg that has been cooked in boiling water. You see the white part, which is albumen, has become very hard. When it is in this state it will take more than three hours before it can be digested. This other egg has not been cooked in boiling water; the albumen, you see, is soft and creamy, very different from that hard albumen. It will digest in two hours, and will strengthen the nerves much better than the albumen would do which is in that hard-boiled egg. There is something written down on the blackboard about albumen, which you must copy. It is as follows :—'Albumen becomes hard and indigestible when it is cooked in water that is at 212°, which is boiling-point.' At the end of the lecture I will send this thermometer round, for you to examine it and see that 212° is the boiling-point. I am now going to tell you about the injury spirits do to our different organs. Drunkards suffer very much from stomach as well as from liver complaints, because all the liquids that Ave taka.have to pass through the stomach before they get to the liver.

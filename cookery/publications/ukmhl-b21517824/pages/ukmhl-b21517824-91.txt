VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 69 vertebral column are called vertebrate animals, and many of thembave organs like tbose ofÂ«a buman being, tbougb tbey are not all placed in tbe same way. In some animals, however, certain organs are absent; in others they are represented by Fig. 25. Vertebrate aniinals have the same organs as human beings. This picture shows how the different organs aro placed in a weasel, m, mouth ; b, brain ; I, windpipe ; p, lungs; It, the heart; 7, liver ; t", intestines and stomach ; s, spinal cord. organs performing a similar office, but having a different structure. Fish, for example, breathe by means of gills ; they have no lungs. I have brought pictures of the skeleton of a horse, a bird, a fish, and a reptile, and you will see that they all have a vertebral column, or backbone, and a bony skull.1 Here is a frog. You can see its heart and other organs, and its foot, that doctors often put under a microscope to show the circula- tion of the blood through the capillaries. The frog is a most useful and curious creature, but I cannot now tell you more about it. When I take you to the Museum you shall see all the animals I have talked about. The animals I am going to say something about to-day are the horse and the donkey. Look at the horse's skull, and you will see that it has a very different shape from the skull of a man.2 The horse's skull is flat at the top, and has a very small 'great brain.' All animals except man have a very small quantity of brain at the top of the head. You know it 1 Skeleton of a horse, page 72. 1 Show a human skull, or picture of one, page 21.

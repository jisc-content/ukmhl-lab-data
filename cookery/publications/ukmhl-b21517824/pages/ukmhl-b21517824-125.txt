DRINK FOR ANIMALS. Every fountain ought to have a place put low down, so that sheep, dogs, cats, and other small animals may be able to satisfy their thirst. It is a very cruel practice to put muzzles on dogs, that shut up their mouths and prevent them from drinking and from putting out their tongues. Dogs perspire chiefly through their tongues and mouths ; very little sweat comes out of the pores of their skins. You must all have noticed on a hot day that dogs let their tongues hang out. When they are running fast they only breathe freely when the mouth is open and the tongue out, as their nostrils are rather small. When muzzles are considered neces- sary, they should be made of wire, and large, so that the mouth can open. The best wayio make a dog go mad is to strap up its mouth with the kind' of muzzle generally used in England. Things provided for the Lecture. Fresh clot of an ox's blood.

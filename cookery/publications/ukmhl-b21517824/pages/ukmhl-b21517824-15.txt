xiii FIRST EDITION. working-women and their daughters, who received all I had to say, as my Leeds friends had done, with the greatest grati- tude and eagerness. On all sides I heard the strongest regrets expressed that they had not been taught early in life what every woman ought to know. My warmest thanks are due to all my friends in Leeds and elsewhere, who have so kindly helped me, either person- ally or by their writings, to cull the information contained in this little volume. I should like to express my obligation to Mr. Marshall, F.R.S., the distinguished surgeon and physiologist, for the advice he was always ready to give during the revision of the manuscript. This kindness was doubly appreciated by me, as it was rendered voluntarily to the work of a perfect stranger. I cannot conclude without also mentioning the name of Mr. Wheelhouse, F.R.C.S., one of our leading medical men. In the midst of his large practice he has always been ready to clear up difficulties which books failed to make plain. From the first he gave me his sympathy, and encouraged me to carry out my work by the assurance that the efforts made by the medical profession to hinder the loss of life and suffering: caused by preventible diseases will ever prove unavailing until ignorant prejudices have been removed by sanitary knowledge.

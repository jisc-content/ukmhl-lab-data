104 MILK AND MINERAL FOODS, LECTURE XV. MILK AND MINERAL FOODS. New milk is a body-warmer and a flesh-former, and contains everything the body requires. It is digested in two hours. The following things are contained in one pint of cow's milk and in one pint of mother's milk :— AVater .... Flesh-former Body-warmer Phosphate of lime, potash, and other salts } Coiv's Milk. Mother's Milk. 13 oz. 14 oz. f oz. less. oz. more. \ oz. same.

If we do not eat solid food, these fluids will gradually become less and less, just as the so-called joint-oil slowly goes away from joints which are not used. If, on the other hand, we take too much liquid food, we shall give the organs that digest liquid food too much work to do, and they will get out of order, and will soon be wrorn out. It is very bad for grown-up people to take only liquid food ; you will wonder how it is possible that a baby can live on nothing but milk for the first year of its life, for milk appears to be a liquid food. I will explain how some of the milk we drink always becomes a solid food in the stomach. Here is some gastric juice which was taken from the lining skin of a calf's stomach after it was killed. It is exactly the same kind of gastric juice as that which comes out of the stomach of a human being. I will put some into this tumbler, and you will see at the end of my lecture that about half the

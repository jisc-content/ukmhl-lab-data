195 SELF-ACTING COOKING APPARATUS. If an Apparatus with two saucepans be used, it may at any time be opened while cooking is going on in one pan, to add another with hoiled-up water or food, hut the box must not be left open for more- than a minute or two. If required to cook in one saucepan only, and the apparatus holds two or more, fill the saucepans not in use with boiling water. The bottom of the saucepan should be greased before being put on the fire, and wiped with a cloth previously to being placed in the Apparatus. X.B.â€”The food must be cooked in the pans belonging to the Apparatus, and when used for boiling, the water is not to be poured away when the pan is taken off the fire. AS When it is desired to keep meat or other food, which has been previously cooked, hot, use one of the saucepans fitted with a jacket, which should be filled with boiling water, and the dry chamber of the Apparatus used for the hot meat. Any kind of viands may be kept hot for hours in this manner, and when eaten will be found quite as palatable as if only just cut from the joint. HOW TO DRESS A SCALD OR BURN. Everybody should know how to manage a scald or a burn. Doctors say that the most distressing cases that are brought to an infirmary are those caused by scalds and burns, because the parents have not understood how to treat them. I once called at a house where a little girl had burnt her arm. The mother showed me the place, and tore off the linen rag, saying, 'It ought to be better, for I wash it regidnr twice a day.' o 2

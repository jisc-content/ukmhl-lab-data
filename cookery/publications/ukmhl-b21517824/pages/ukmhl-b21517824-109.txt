Describe all you can remember about the way in which a dinner of solid food—beef and potatoes—is digested and turned into good blood. LECTURE XII. DIGESTION AND CARBONACEOUS FOODS. To-DAY I will first explain what is meant by animal and vegetable food. You will often meet people who will say, 4 We are vegetarians ; we never eat meat.' If you ask them if they never eat eggs, butter, milk, cream, cheese, they will say, ' Oh, certainly we do.' They forget that all these foods are most nourishing animal foods. The eggs we chiefly eat in England are those laid by hens and ducks; milk, butter, cheese, and cream we get from that most useful animal the cow. These are therefore all animal foods. Animal food means any food that has come from an animal. What is vegetable food ? It is anything that grows in the ground—grass, corn (which is ground into flour and made into bread), oatmeal, rice, potatoes, sugar, &c. Sugar is a vegetable food.

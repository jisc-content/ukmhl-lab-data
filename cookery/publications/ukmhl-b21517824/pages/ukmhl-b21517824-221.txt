To them is due the initiation of these lectures. Mrs. Baily, Mrs. Fenwick, myself, and our late talented townswoman, Mrs. James Kitson, were invited three years ago by this body to give some sanitary lectures to the working-women of Leeds. The Council find rooms, issue notices, provide diagrams, and do all that is possible to relieve ladies of any unnecessary trouble. The two pamphlets written respectively by Mrs. J. Kitson and myself were published by them. Their office is at 9 Tower Buildings, Leeds. Any application directed to the general Honorary Secretary (Mrs. Francis Lupton) will be immediately attended to. It is to be hoped that every town and village will soon possess a similar organisation. APPENDIX III. QUESTIONS ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.

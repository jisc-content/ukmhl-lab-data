These goodies are generally eaten between meals, and spoil the appetite. Eating between meals is a very bad habit for persons of all ages. I have only one thing more to tell you about carbonaceous food. It is that all body-warmers, both animal and vegetable—namely, starch, fat, sugar, treacle— are made of only three things: carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. You are now going to hear about the foods which make our flesh and forty organs. A list of them is written down on that sheet. I will read them over to you.1 Flesh-formers. Animal. Vegetable. Meat. Game. Flour. Kice. Fish. Fggs. Oatmeal. Peas. Poultry. Cheese. Barley, Eye. Lentils. All these foods contain four things—oxygen, hydrogen, carbou, and nitrogen. Nitrogen is a gas I have never told you about before, because all the foods called ' body-warmers,' that make fat, have none of this gas. There is a great deal of it, however, in the air. The air is chiefly made up of nitrogen mixed with oxygen, of which you have already heard so much. All foods that make flesh must have nitrogen, and are therefore called ' nitrogenous foods.'2 All animal and vegetable flesh-formers contain a substance called albumen. This is a most important substance, as it is with the help of albumen that all our nerves, as well as our flesh or muscles, are made. I will first show you some animal albumen : the white of an egg is albumen ; an egg is apimal food. I have broken an egg and put it unboiled into this glass bottle, so that you may all be able to see, when I hold it up, that it contains a white 1 I showed a table of flesh-formers. 2 I wrote this on the blackboard.

VARIETY OF REPASTS. 357 The augurs treated themselves magnificently in their turn {cosna augur alls), when they entered on their functions. The pagan priests of Rome vied one with another in a noble emulation of exquisite refine- ment and ruinous viands;25 but it is said that the ministers of Mars, who had the reputation of being arch-epicureans {cosna saliaris), always won the palm in this struggle of magnificence and voluptuousness.26 The day the Emperor took the title of Augustus, he gave a supper {cosna imperatoria) to the senators and magistrates.

At the birth of a child,38 a banquet was given in his honour; he was named on the tenth day, aud the ceremony terminated with a banquet,30 in which they offered the guests cooked Cherso cheese, cabbage boiled in oil. pigeons, thrushes, fish, and brimming cups of excellent wine.40 The teething repast took place when the child had attained his seventh month, and the weaning supper when he began to eat.41 These family feasts, more or less sumptuous according to the fortune and rank of the individuals who gave them, were generally signalized by

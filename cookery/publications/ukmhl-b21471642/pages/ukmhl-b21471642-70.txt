GRINDING OF CORN. 2U Now Mola was one of a large family; she had several charming sisters, like herself, who could not endure living among the commoners, while Ganymede served ambrosia to their elder sister, or poured out for her the nectar of the gods. Besides, it cost so little to be made a goddess! A few grains of incense, more or less, who would grudge such a trifle? The Flamine of Jupiter, whom they consulted, was at first rather refractory. He feared the crowding of Olympus; he doubted whether polite intercourse could ever be established between gods of high birth and little divinities covered with flour; but when at last the high priest had ceased speaking, the deputation removed all scruples by a reasonable bribe, and the sisters of Mola were forthwith enrolled in the list of immortals, under the designation of well-beloved daughters of the god of war.22 Mars was rather ungentlemanly on the occasion, but the high priest undertook to bring him to reason.

These honest creatures' heads24 were crowned with roses, and necklaces of little leaves encircled their necks and fell gracefully on their chests ;25 we need not add that, on this day, the thick bandages which generally covered the eyes of these useful labourers were removed.20 Independently of this annual solemnity, the asses, turners of the mills, had sometimes their windfalls,—that is to say, hours of holiday, during which they could freely graze on the neighbouring thistles. This happened when an awkward slave performed badly the duties of fanning his master, or spilt carelessly a feAv drops of Falernian Avine when filling his cup. The unfortunate creature was immediately condemned to work at the mill ;27 he was deprived of his name, and received in lieu that of the quadruped he replaced—Asinus;2* and the instrument of his sufferings, by a refinement of strange irony, was called his manger.29 It sometimes happened that a free man, reduced to extreme indi-

XIX. HUNTING. From the first ages of the world man has passionately loved the exercise of hunting; the dangers he then encountered inflamed his courage. It was glorious to struggle with the terrible inhabitants of the forest or the desert; to conquer them ; to bring home their bleeding spods; to furnish an heroic name for the songs of poets, and the admiration of posterity. The sacred writings have handed down to us the name of the first mighty hunter before the Lord ;l they inform us that Ishmael, in the solitude of Arabia, became skilful in drawing the bow ;2 and that David, when yet young, dared to fight with lions and bears.3 Fable, that veiled light of truth, through which it sometimes glim- mers, caused Hercules to be ranked with the gods when he had over- thrown the lion of Nemaea, the hydra of Lerna, and the wild boar of Erymanthus.4 Diana descended to the earth, and pursued in the forests the timid stag.5 The Greeks raised altars to her, and the centaur Chiron learned of her the noble art of venery, which he, in his turn, taught to illus- trious disciples, among whom are mentioned iEsculapius, Nestor, The- seus, Ulysses, and Achilles.6 Pollux trained the first hunting dogs, and Castor accustomed horses to follow the track of wild beasts.7 From that time, heroes, when resting from real conquests, sought diversion in games nearly as formidable, and imitative of their combats, which often placed their lives in danger. Ulysses, for example, always bore the scar of a wound inflicted by a wild boar.8

FISH. 212 hundred times in their writings, and various personages are the subjects of biting sarcasms on account of their excessive partiality to the mullet, scar, and turbot. We may name, among others, Philoxenes of Cythera, â– who learning from his doctor that he was going to die of indigestion, for having eaten too much of a most exquisite fish : " Be it so," he calmly exclaimed ; " but, before I go, allow me to finish the remainder." 9 Everyone knows the witty jokes of Lucian, who informs us that he knew a philosopher who examined, with the most serious comicality, the nature of the soul of an oyster.10 Highly favoured by the neighbourhood of the sea, the Greek popu- lation applied themselves, with that peculiar taste which characterized them, to distinguish the best species; and skilful cooks knew how to give to fish the most refined flavour, thanks to the numerous combi- nations of ingredients which we too have learned from the ancient authors who have written on dietetics.

Sym- machus, Polycrates, and Lamprias, tried to prove, in their writings, that those who eat fish were the most cruel and ferocious of men. These tender ichthyophilists were laughed at, and their works had no sale. The Romans inherited the predilection of the Greeks, " For the

FISH. 288 SCATE. The ancients liked or disliked scale, according to the places where they eat it. So, now, this fish is rejected in Sardinia, and thought ex- cellent in London and Paris.1" The Greek gastronomists of fashion sometimes partook of the back of the scate;105 the remainder seemed unworthy of their attention, and a certain poet maintains that a piece of stuff, uoiled, offers to the palate a flavour quite as agreeable.100 Italian gluttony always gave a cold reception to this dish, which they owed to the Greek cooks, and which their magiric writers have not suf- ficiently studied. Aristotle knew of two species of scate ;'67 Pliny speaks of them ;10s Lacepede enumerates thirty-nine species.109 That celebrated naturalist, Buffon's pupil and competitor, assures us . that several eastern nations consider the smoke arising from the eggs of scates, thrown on burning coals, and inhaled by the mouth and nostrils, as an excellent remedy against intermittent fever.170 It would costImt little to make the experiment. SALMON. It is reported that the salmon was thus named on account of its frequent leaping.171 It has been sung by Ausonius.172 Its absence left a chasm in the delights of Greece, and it was late before it became known in Rome. Pliny is the first of Latin authors who name it.173 Ichthy- ophagy will cherish the memory of this laborious author. He speaks with praise of the salmon taken in the Garonne and Dordogne. He extols those of the Rhine, but he seems to give a decided preference to those magnificent fishes covered with a silvery mail, which disport in the limpid waters of that picturesque and beautiful Aquitaine.'71* Two centuries ago, there was such a great quantity of salmon taken in the rivers of Scotland, that, instead of being considered a delicate * Ft is a question whether they could compete in quality with those caught in the Severn at the present day.

A ROMAN SUPPER. 380 Here and there a few persons are remarked who still wear their togas, having doubtless forgotten to substitute the banqueting dress. So soon as the major-domo perceives them he makes a sign to some youths clothed in white tunics, who hasten to present to each of these guests a synthesis, or short woollen vestment of different colours,20 which envelopes the whole body, but leaves the shoulders and breast uncovered if the wearer desire it.21 These indispensable preliminaries being terminated, the seats disap- peared, and the guests stood waiting for the freed-man, Seba, who speedily entered accompanied by the two consuls, for whom places of honour bad been reserved on couches beside their pompous amphitryon.

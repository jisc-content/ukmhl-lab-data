MANIPULATION OF FLOUR. 87 use as bread. Its name, its form, and flavour indicated the various ranks of society to which it belonged.3" There was the senator's bread, that of the knights, of the citizens, of the people, and that of the peasants.60 Let us go together under the vast galleries supported by those magnificent arcades." The ediles have preceded us; they are visiting the shops;62 it is the Forum Pistrinwn, or bread-market. The year is good: a septier (five bushels) of wheat is only twenty-five shillings,63 and provisions of all kinds abound in Eome. Foreigners, also, are here, attracted by curiosity; for Vespasian is preparing to deposit with solemnity the spoils of Jerusalem in the temple of Peace.64 In the middle of the inclosure you see the statue of Vesta, the god- dess worshipped by bakers.65 In the front, and round the gallery, those open stalls are loaded with a number of round loaves of the same form and weight: they are all five inches in thickness; the top is divided by eight notchesâ€”that is to say, they are first divided across, and the four parts are again subdivided.66 These lines are made in the dough, so that they may be more easily broken.

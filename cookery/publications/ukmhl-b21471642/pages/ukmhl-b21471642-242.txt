HUNTING. 182 King Harold never appeared anywhere without his favourite hawk on his hand ; neither was the approach of the British Nimrod announced otherwise than by the joyous barking of the royal pack.44 Indeed, at that epoch, every person of distinction took the prince as his model, and gave himself up, heart and soul, to what people are pleased to call " the noble exercise of hunting."

Perchance it had but a slight attraction for the worthy matrons, and yet they pre- ferred it to every other, for this reason, that the stag being free from

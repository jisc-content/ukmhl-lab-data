XXV. WATER. Thales, -who borrowed from Egypt the elements of philosophy, which he afterwards spread in Greece, taught that water is the vivifying prin- ciple of all things; that nature is thereby made fruitful; that without it the earth, arid and laid waste, would be a frightful desert, where every effort of man to support his existence must fail.1 These ideas, for a long time adopted by Pagan theology, peopled fountains, rivers, and seas, with divinities, and often confounded in the same worship those gods, sons of gratitude, with the limpid waters consecrated to them. The Persians carried their veneration for this element so far, that they dared not wash their hands, and would have preferred being consumed to the very bone rather tban dip themselves in a river.2 The Cappadocians were proud of treadiDg in the same path.3 The Egyptians offered prayers and homage to water.4 The Nile, in particular, received their adorations under the name of Ypeus, or Siris, and they offered to it—as a sacrifice—barley, wheat, sugar, and fruit.5 The Scythians honoured the Danube on account of its vast extent; the Thessalians prostrated themselves before the majestic shores of the Peneus ; the ancient combat of Achelous with Hercules made it sacred to the iEtolians; by a special law, the Lacedaemonians were compelled to implore the Eurotas; and a religious precept forced the Athenians to incense in honour of the Ilissus.6 The Greeks and Romans did not fail to follow such good examples. Tbe fountains and rivers had their altars. The Rhine was called a god ; and when iEneas arrived in Italy, he prayed it might be favourable to him.7

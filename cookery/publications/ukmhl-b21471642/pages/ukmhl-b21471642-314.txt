The Greeks were remarkably fond of this fish,265 especially when obtained from Alexandria.266 They were not less esteemed in Rome, where they eat them boiled with cummin, and seasoned with pepper, alisander, parsley, dried mint, and a great quantity of cummin; the whole carefully and well ground, and mixed with honey, vinegar, and garum, to which was sometimes added some liquid perfume.267 " Crayfishes can be preserved several days, not too wann, in baskets with some fresh grass, such as the nettle, or in a bucket with three-eighths of an inch of water. If there were enough water in it to cover them, they would die in a few moments, because then- great con- sumption of air does not allow them to live in water unless it is con- tinually renewed."â€”Bosc. CRAB. Would you like to eat crab sausages ? Boil some of these animals ; reduce them to a pulp; mix with this some spikenard, garum, pepper, and eggs; give to this the ordinary shape of sausages, place them on the stove or gridiron, and you will, by these means, obtain a delicate and tempting dish.268 Apicius assures us of the fact: Apicius was a connoisseur! A crab may also be served whole, boiled, and accompanied by a seasoning of pepper, cummin, and rue, which the cook skilfully mixes with garum, honey, oil, and vinegar.269 Is it preferred stuffed ? Then fill it with a skilful mixture of cummin, mint, rue, alisander, pine nuts, and pepper, the whole long soaked in garum, honey, vinegar, and wine.270

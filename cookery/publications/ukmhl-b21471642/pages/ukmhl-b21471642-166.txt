PIP FRUIT. 110 These difficulties will probably, disappear, if we remember that the ancients have given to the lemon tree various names29 which belong to other trees. The truth is, that the Athenians received it from the Persians, who were neighbours of the Medes, and from Attica it spread all over Greece.30 Lemons were only known to the Romans at a very late period, and at first were used only to keep the moths from their garments.

MANIPULATION OF FLOUR. 81 the family generally renewed them each day.9 The inhabitants of the East thought so much of bread, that it was considered a special mark of regard and hospitality to the person to whom it was offered.10 Boaz says to Ruth: " At meal time come thou hither and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar." 11 Although the use of bread without leaven and baked under the ashes was common among the Jews/2 it is nevertheless evident that they knew and employed, at an early period, some substance to raise the dough, which they designated by the name of seor. It was, perhaps, flour diluted with water left to get sour. Pliny assures us that of all means employed by the ancients to render bread savoury and light, this is the most simple and easy.13 It appears not unlikely that the Hebrews learned from the Egyptians how to prepare the leaven they made use of. The period at which an allusion is made to it for the first time, in the Bible, renders this sup- position likely. It is when the people of God were about to escape from the slavery of the Egyptians, and are preparing to celebrate the Passover, on the eve of their setting out for the Desert.14 The Israelites, therefore, knew how to make bread more digestive and of better taste than is generally believed—not so good, perhaps, as our delicate fancy bread, but better than the clumsy lumps of paste baked under the ashes, in the frying-pan, or on the gridiron.15 They had also ovens at a very distant period of their history—some four thousand years ago.16 These ovens were made with bricks or clay; afterwards they used iron and brass ;17 but nothing in the Holy Writings shows us that any one exercised among them the trade of a baker, at least at this early period, nor, indeed, very much later. The chief baker or butler, whose punishment and death Joseph foretold, when he interpreted that officer's dream, was an Egyptian, and belonged to King Pharaoh.18 Hitherto an infallible book has been our guide; let us now dive into the dark and almost boundless regions of fabulous antiquity. The most frightful god of which the fevered imagination of man could possibly form an idea—a god with the face and legs of a goat, the horrible Pan !—according to some credulous writers, taught mortals the art of making and baking bread. The name even of this food, they say, furnishes an incontestable proof of this assertion.19 You are mistaken, reply more sensible writers; it is in the Greek word pan,

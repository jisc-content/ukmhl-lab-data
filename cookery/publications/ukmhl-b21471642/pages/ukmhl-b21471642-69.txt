GRINDING OF CORN. mortars.9 The early Romans adopted the same means,, and gave the name of Pistores, grinders, to those persons who followed this occupation.10 Pliny relates that one of the ancient families of Rome took the surname of Piso, having descended, as they believed, from the iuventor of the arc of bruising wheat with pestles.11 Down to the latest days of the Roman republic the corn was bruised after being roasted. The pestle used for this purpose was somewhat pointed, and suspended by the aid of a ring to the extremity of a flexible lever, supported by an axle.12 From the time of Moses the Hebrews used grinding-stones: several passages of the Holy Scripture clearly indicate this. Among others : " No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a man's life to pledge."13 Another text shows that the Egyptians used grinding-stones with handles, at about the same period.14 The Israelites, when in the Desert, employed the same means to pound manna,15 and after their settlement in the Promised Land, these utensils served to grind corn. The Greeks, following faithfully the system from which they had but slightly deviated, have honoured King Miletus as the inventor of grinding-stones/6 the upper part was of wood, and armed with heads of iron nails. A rjassage of Homer would seem to lead us to believe that the grain was first crushed with rollers on stone slabs, which operation would naturally lead to the crushing of it between grinding-stones.17 However this may be, these last were no doubt still scarce in the heroic times, since the same poet does not fail to inform us that one was to be seen in the gardens of Alcinous, chief of the Pheeacians.18 This kind of decoration would but very little please the taste of our modern horticulturists. Nearly two centuries before our era, in the year of Rome 562, the Romans, victorious in Asia, brought with them handmills.19 This con- quest of industry soon made an immense stride, and to the labour of man succeeded by degrees the obedient aid of horses and asses. Hence the two kind of mills so often mentionedâ€”by hand, manuales ; by animal, iumentcvrim.19 Delighted with a discovery which supplied an important necessity of life, the Romans invented a divinity to whom they might show their gratitude, and Olympus was honoured with a new inmate : the goddess Mola, protectress and patroness of mills and millstones.21 c

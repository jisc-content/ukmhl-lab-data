XXVIII. WINE. Bacchus, son of Ammon, was born in Egypt, and was the first who taught his countrymen the art of cultivating the vine, and of making wine. He is the same as Osiris, the famous conqueror of India.1 Should this assertion be contradicted, we shall only entreat any and every disputant to make his own choice of the god of vineyards, from among the five heroes bearing the name of Bacchus, as we are too impartial to prefer any one in particular.2 CEnopion, worthy son of one of these heroes, enriched the inhabit- ants of Chios with the first rosy wine that ever yet obscured their reason.3 Greece, Italy, and Sicily owed this wonderful liquor to the Egyptians. The Gauls received this sweet present from a Tuscan, who had been banished from Clusium, his country ;4 and the cultivation of the grape spread rapidly till the reign of the sanguinary Domitian, who completed the catalogue of his crimes by tearing up the vines.5 The Emperor Probus restored them to the disconsolate Gauls.6 That prince was certainly worthy of his name ! Modern science, agreeing with holy writ,7 looks upon the east as the common cradle of the vine and the human race. Palestine was renowned for its vines. Pliny speaks in praise of them.8 The vineyards constituted a part of the riches of the country, and they were preserved with the greatest care; so much so that Moses, with an especial view to vines, forbade the sowing of different seeds in the same field, on pain of confiscation :9 and it was done to encourage their cultivation, that that wise legislator exempted every person who had planted one from military service, and from all public duties, until the first vintage.10

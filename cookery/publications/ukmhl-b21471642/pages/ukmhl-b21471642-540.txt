A ROMAN SUPPER. 388 fortified the gums—those fortresses of mastication. Some persons made use of substances which no one would adopt in the present day, .because our delicacy revolts against them." But preparations less offensive were employed, and men of good taste, as well as fashionable ladies, extolled ox-gall, goats' milk, the ash of stags' horns, of pigs' hoofs, and of egg-shells.7 Thus were the teeth equipped, as the comic Plautus has it;8 or, rather, thus were they prepared to undergo the labour required of them. Those who had had the misfortune to lose some of those powerful gastrophagic auxiliaries substituted false ones of ivory, which art found means to render absolutely similar to their neighbours. The eye was deceived: what more could be required ?9 But the clepsydrae10 and the celebrated clock of the field of Mars11 announce that it is time to put on the white, light robe, a little longer than the pallium of the Geeeks, and to which the Latins have given the names of testis coenatoria, vestis triclinaria, vestis convivalis.12 This last part of their toilet finished, the guests set out for the magni- ficent abode of their host, preceded by a few slaves, and followed by their shadows—those hungry hangers-on of whom mention has already been made, and who strive to obtain, on the road, a smile or a word by dint of cringing obsequiousness. Arrived at the atrium, the crowd of Bom an nobles are conducted into the interior of the house by the parasites of Seba.

The feet then received a similar ablution, and fresh slaves, skilful orthopcedists, accomplish in a twinkling the delicate toilet of these extremities,18 and imprison them again in elegant and commodious sandals, fastened by ribands which cross on the top.19

67 PLANTS USED IN SEASONING. SOW-THISTLE. This plant furnished a kind of milk, which was sometimes drunk : sometimes various kinds of meat were seasoned with it.7 It was after- wards given up to rabhits, and there is every probability that they will retain undisputed possession of it. OliACH. Few vegetables have been more exposed to injurious accusations. Pythagoras reproaches it with causing a livid paleness, dropsy, and the scrofula, in those persons who eat it.8 Nevertheless, a greedy curiosity introduced it into the catalogue of culinary preparations, and the guests of Apicius tasted more than once the fatal orach without knowing its pernicious properties. History does not say that they suffered any pernicious effects from it. This plant is also eaten like spinach, and mixed with sorrel to soften its acidity.â€”Bosc. ROCKET. Persons about to undergo the punishment of the whip were recom- mended to swallow a cup of wine, in which rocket had been steeped. It was asserted that this draught rendered pain supportable.9 And again, that this plant, taken with honey, removed the freckles which sometimes appear on the face.10 Whatever may be the degree of credence aceorded to these two recipes, this vegetable enjoyed some reputation among the ancients, who mixed the wild and the garden rocket together, so as to temper the heat of th e one by the coldness of the other."

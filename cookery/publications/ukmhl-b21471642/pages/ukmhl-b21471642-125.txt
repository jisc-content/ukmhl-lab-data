69 KITCHEN GARDEN. the ancients recognised in purslaine many admirable virtues,82 which are not acknowledged in the present day. The internal use of this plant, also its external application, cured the bite of serpents, wounds inflicted by poisoned arrows, and infallibly neutralized the effects of poisonous drinks.83 But, alas! purslaine is not now what it was formerly; for it is hardly permitted to appear by the side of one of our fresh white lettuces. SOKKEL. Son-el is a polygenous plant, and grows throughout Europe amidst the grass fields. The Eomans cultivated it in order to give it more vigour,84 and ate it sometimes stewed with mustard, and seasoned with a little oil and vinegar.85 BROCOLI. Drusus, son of Tiberius, was so passionately fond of the brocoli, which Apicius induced him to eat, that he was more than once severely reprimanded by his father on the subject.86 It is true that the celebrated Roman epicurean displayed so much art, and gave such delicious flavour to it, that this dish alone would have been enough to establish his reputation. In fact, brocoli has always been appreciated by connois- seurs ; and Glaucias, who passed his life in meditating seriously on the perfectibility of culinary ingredients, said: "That nothing could be better than this vegetable, boiled and suitably seasoned." 87 This was the method of preparing it at Rome: they used only the most tender and delicate parts of the brocoli, which were boiled with that extreme care the artist always devotes to this first operation; and, afterwards, when the water had been well drained off, they added some cummin seed, pepper, chopped onions, and coriander seedâ€”all bruised together, not forgetting, before serving up, to add a little oil and sun-made wine."

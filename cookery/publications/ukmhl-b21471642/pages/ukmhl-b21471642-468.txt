344 REPASTS. In the primitive times, kings prepared their own suppers.53 Beef, mutton, goat's flesh—such were the viands which then satisfied the daintiest palates." Baskets, filled with pure wheaten bread, were carried round to the guests," and heaps of salt, placed on the table, gave proof of the hospitality of those simple and unsophisticated ages.50 The fierce warriors of that warlike period never forgot to invoke the gods before they satisfied their appetites: libations of wine rendered them favourable.57 This pious duty once fulfilled, they gave themselves up without restraint, to the joys of good cheer; and the sounds of the lyre and the buffooneries of mountebanks enlivened the banquet,58 which again received fresh animation from the copious healths, which persons the least versed in the forms of society never forgot.59 It often happened that each one paid his share, or brought provi- sions with him00 tb these joyous sappers, of which the last rays of the setting sun always gave the periodical signal.61 The uncertainty of these amicable meetings constituted their charm. Pic-nics, as we see, may be traced rather far back. It was then that pleasure presided at those repasts; dulness had its turn when luxury proscribed the supper in open air, and in common,62 after the manner of the Jews, who assembled in gardens, or under trees,63 and mingled the sweet harmony of music with the less delicate seduc- tions of their banquets.6* The breakfast has always taken place after rising; dinner in the middle of the clay ; the collation in the course of the afternoon; and the supper in the evening.

In the 16th century, and at the commencement of the 17th, they dined at mid-day in the best houses. Louis XIV., himself, always sat clown to table at that hour.66 This order was not modified until the 18th century. The Sicilian cooks taught unheard-of refinements, and were sought after with strange eagerness.67 The chine of beef and haunch of mut- ton of the Homeric epoch, gave way to sumptuous banquets, and a learned prodigality divided .them into two or three acts, or courses,68 the order and luxurious majesty of which have been adopted in modern times. It appears that three or four o'clock in the afternoon—the ninth horn— was the time invariably fixed for the supper of the Eomaus.69 Like the

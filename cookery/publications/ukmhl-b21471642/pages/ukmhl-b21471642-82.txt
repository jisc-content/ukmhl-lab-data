Nature makes us hungry; art creates, modifies, and directs the appetite—these are incon- testable truths, which this work will serve to unfold, and, if necessary, to prove, should any of our readers unfortunately not be already con- vinced of the depth of these wise axioms. Let us go no further back than the year 2000 before the Christian era, and enter together the tent of the father of nations—Abraham.

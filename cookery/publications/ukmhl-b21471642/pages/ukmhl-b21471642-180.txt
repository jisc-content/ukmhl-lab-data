124 ANIMAL FOOD. prepared the development of that marvellous faculty to which no pos- sible limit can be assigned—the last to disappear, and to which, in fact, are related nearly all the actions of human life—the sense of taste. Heathen authors, guided by the lights of reason, some gleams of tradition, and perhaps not absolutely strangers to the writings of Moses, agree pretty well on the diet of the Golden Age;11 that age of innocence, acorns, and happiness,12 when everywhere were seen streams of milk, and nectar, and honey, flowing from the hollow oaks and other trees of the forests.13 But when the question is to point out the time at which the use of animal food Avas introduced, ideas become clouded, and highly intelligent minds, bewildered by the obscurity which envelops the subject, have frequently appealed to absurd legends and ridiculous fables, invoking the aid of their false and contested authority. Xenocrates pretends that Triptolemus forbad the Athenians to eat animals.11 Man must, then, have been still frugivorous for four centuries after the Deluge. This opinion found contradictors, who maintained that man con- tented himself with fruit only because fire was wanting to cook meat; but Prometheus came, and taught him how to draw the useful element from the flint which concealed it, and was the first to venture on the sacrifice of an ox.15 This happened in the year of the world 2412.10 All this is a mistake, say other and very sensible writers; here is the truth on this difficult point: The goddess Ceres had sown a field, and the wheat came up as desired, when a pig entered, tumbled about, and caused considerable damage, which so irritated the lady that she punished him with death. Now, as a pig is good for nothing except to eat, this one was eaten; and from that day, so fatal to the swinish race, mankind learnt to appreciate the flesh of animals.17 At the same time, Bacchus killed a goat he found nibbling at the tendrils of his darling vines ;18 and Hyberbius, son of Mars, and a slasher, like his father, amused himself by killing another, in order to become familiar thus early with scenes of combat.19 These goats were roasted; and as experience had as yet furnished no rule of comparison, and formed no taste—that exquisite sentiment of the beautiful in the plastic arts, and of the good in the culinary science—it was decided that this dish was very tolerable. Hitherto the bovine race had only lost one individual: its sad

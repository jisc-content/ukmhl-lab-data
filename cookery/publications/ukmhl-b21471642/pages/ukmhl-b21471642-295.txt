FISH. 229 CAKP. The carp occupied a very honourable rank with the Greeks and Latins, but only as a fish of the second order.137 At Athens, they picked out the bones and stuffed it with silphium, cheese, salt, and marjoram.138 The Romans boiled it and mixed it with sows' paps, fowls' flesh, fig-peckers, or thrashes; and when the whole was made into a kind of pulp, they added raw eggs and oil; then they sprinkled it over with pepper and alisander; after which they poured wine, garum, and cooked wine over it; aud when the culinary combination was completed in the stewpan, by the assistance of a slow fire, it was then thickened with flour.139 In several countries it is known at what period the carp was natu- ralized. Peter Marshall brought it to England in 1514; Peter Oxe to Denmark in 1560. A few years after, it was introduced into Holland arid Sweden. The fecundity of this fish is surprising; no less than .621,600 eggs were found in a carp weighing nine pounds; and it is very long-lived. Several have been seen in the moats of the castle of Ponchartrain, which were proved to be 150 years old. Carp are capable of acquiring considerable dimensions. The most gigantic on record was that caught at Bisshofs-hause, near Frankfort on the Oder; it weighed 70 lbs.140 EEL-POUT. The liver of the eel-pout (also known by the names, lota, lote, and lotus) is particularly large, and so delicate that a certain Countess of Beuchlingen squandered a large portion of her income to gratify her taste for them.141 That lady, worthy, by her refined and antique taste, of the proudest period of Roman extravagance, was, perhaps, not aware that the most fastidious epicureans of Italy, enthusiastic admirers of the liver of this fish,142 had it served with a sauce composed of vinegar, grated cheese, and garlic; to which they added leeks and onions, chopped tine."3

387 A ROMAN SUPPER. So that it was no sooner whispered among the Roman aristocracy that the magnificent Seha intended to give a banquet, than one and all became anxious to be numbered with the guests of Caesar's favourite. However, days past, the time for the nocturnal festival approached, and the Invitor had not made his appearance. Among the Hebrews, nothing was more simple and unsophisticated than an invitation to dinner;1 but, with the Romans, etiquette required that the amphitryon should send one of his servants to each person who was to participate in his pompous hospitality. This servant, who was generally a freed-man, went from house to house, and indicated, with exquisite politeness, the day and precise hour of the banquet.2 Seba's Invitor was at last announced to the two consuls of the year, Lecanius Bassus and Licmius Crassus, who accepted with tender gratitude the distinguished honour which the enfranchised slave deigned to confer upon them. After them the same favour was received with the same gratitude by the Agrippas, the Ancuses, the Cossuses, the Drususes, and all those who were the most noble, powerful, and proud in Rome. The next day, about two o'clock in the afternoon (the repast was to begin at six o'clock), an unusual movement reigned in the Palatine baths, and those of Daphnis, near the Sacred Way. The mediastini kept up a steady fire under the coppers; the capsarii folded with care the clothes of the bathers; the unguentarii sold their oils and unguents; and the fricatores, armed with the strigil—a sort of wooden, iron, or horn spoon—rubbed and scraped the skin before the tractatores came gently to manipulate the joints, and skilfully shampoo the body, which gained by this operation more elasticity and suppleness.3 The upper classes of the Romans never sat down to table until they had undergone all these preliminaries of minute cleanliness.* The future guests return home, after the bath, to employ the skill of the barbers {tonsores), who are in waiting to give more grace to the hair, and remove, with the aid of tweezers and pumice, the first silvery indications of the lapse' of years, which, though incessantly effaced, still re-appeared.5 A more serious occupation succeeded. Epicureans should never neglect their teeth—particularly at the approach of a banquet. Nor did the ingenious gastronomy of the first century of our era neglect to invent tooth-powder, which cleaned the enamel without injuring it, and

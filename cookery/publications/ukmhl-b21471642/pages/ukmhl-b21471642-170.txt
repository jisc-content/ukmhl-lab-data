PIP FRUIT. 114 The Romans believed, according to an antique tradition, that their first princes, Romulus and Remus, were found under a fig tree on the shore of the Tiber ; they therefore rendered signal honours to this tree when it was brought into Italy : they planted it in the Forum ; and it was under its shade that a sacrifice was offered every year to the shepherdess who had suckled their founder.54 It may, nevertheless, be affirmed, that no one before Cato had noticed the fig tree,55 which probably appeared in Rome at the same period as the peach, apricot, and other trees of Asia. Sixty years after- wards Varro speaks of it as a novelty from beyond sea, and points out to us that its various species have retained the names of the countries whence they came.50 Those varieties were so numerous, that Pliny counts no less than twenty-nine of them,57 and the designation of the greater part recalled to mind the illustrious families who had taken them under their patronage. The people of the north, especially the moderns, cannot well explain the extraordinary infatuation of the ancient southern nations for the fruit of the fig tree. Perhaps we ought to look for the reason in the nourishing, fresh, and sweet qualities of its pulp, and in the numerous plantations of those trees, which sometimes furnished an agreeable food to entire armies, when other provisions failed.58 That of Philip of Macedon owed its preservation to the figs brought to it by the Magnesians.59 A long time before, David received with joy, front the hands of Abigail, two hundred baskets of dried figs, for himself and his exhausted men.00 More than once the far-famed reputation of some beautiful plan- tations of fig trees brought long and disastrous wars on an entire country, as steel attracts lightning. Xerxes left Persia, and rushed on Attica, to take possession of those delicious figs, whose renown only had crossed his territory :61 and it was partly to eat the figs of Rome that the Gauls waged war against Italy :62 thank Heaven we have now more respect for our neighbours' fig trees. The best things in the world have had their detractors, and the fig is not an exception. Philotimus and Diphilus looked upon it as bad food;03 Galen was unwell after partaking of figs, and he recommends us to mix almonds with them ;04 Hippocrates himself thought them indigestible, and advised to drink plentifully after eating them.65 All these great men may have been right, but the Greeks, their con-

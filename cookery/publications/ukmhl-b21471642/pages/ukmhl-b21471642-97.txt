V. FRUMENTA. Do not be alarmed, fair readers, at the Latin noun which heads this chapter : tolerate it in consideration of our promise seldom to solicit a like favour. It meant, among the Latins, all the plants which produce ears of corn,1 the seeds of which can be converted into flour.2 Clearly there never was a more innocent expression. Barley seems to claim the first place among cereals of the second order; the Greeks looked upon it as the happy symbol of fertility,3 and the ancient inhabitants of Italy gave it a name (Jiordeum) which, per- haps, recalled to their mind the use mankind made of it before wheat was known (exordium).* The Jews had a great esteem for barley, and sacred history generally assimilates it to wheat, when the fruits of the earth are mentioned. Thus a beloved spot produces both these plants :5 Shobi offered to David wheat and barleyand Solomon promises twenty thousand sacks of wheat and as much barley to the workmen charged with cutting down the cedars of Lebanon.7 The Greeks and Romans did not carry their love for this grain so far as the Hebrews. In Rome it was the food of the flocks and cowards.8 In Lacedajmon and at Athens the gladiators and common people had no other aliment;° they made it into barley-gruel (alphitoii), the com- position of which was very simple, and would not probably tempt a modern Lucullus.

Be, above all, attentive to enrich it, at proper intervals, with a delicate gravy extracted from a young fat chicken or from a succulent lamb. Unceasingly watch, lest the ebullition, by going on too rapidly, force this delightful mixture to overflow the side of the vessel; and when your practised palate informs you that it is worthy of yom guests, present it to their impatient sensuality.12 So it appears ^the ancients were acquainted with pearl barley, and barley water; the latter took the name of diet drink (ptisa/ia), which we only associate with melancholy reminiscences.13 Hippocrates was not only in raptures with the virtues and properties of this aliment," but he also conferred the highest praise on that sweet and insipid drink, which our doctors order their patients, as did the oracle of Cos, and which at that time was called " barley broth."15 Oats occupied an honourable place after barley. Pliny fancied these two plants so analogous, that the owner of a field who had sown barley might find oats at the time of harvest, whilst precisely the reverse might happen to his neighbour.16 Nature, in our days, is not subject to such frolics; and our farmers are tolerably certain that, by care, labour, and God's assistance, they will gather from the soil what they have sown. " In order to develop a strong flavour of vanille in black oats, wash this seed, boil it a moment in water, and employ the decoction as you would potato flour, and it will form excellent creams. " In Normandy and Lower Britany they make with flour of oats a delicious soup. The following is the manner they obtain it. They take white oats and put them in the oven; when sufficiently dried, they are fanned, cleaned, and carried to a mill, the grinders of which are freshly

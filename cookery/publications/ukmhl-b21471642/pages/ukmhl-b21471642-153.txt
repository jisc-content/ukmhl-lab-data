XII. STONE FRUIT. OLIVE TREE. Throughout antiquity we find the olive tree acknowledged as some- thing venerable and holy, and taking precedence of all other trees, even the most useful on account of their nourishing fruits, or the refreshing drink they furnished. The wise Minerva gave it birth j1 and its foliage, which adorned the brows of the goddess,2 served, thenceforth, to crown victory,3 or to give rise to the sweet hopes of peace.4 A green bough of olive rendered the suppliant inviolable.5 The deadly arrows of Hercules were made of its wood.6 From it princes borrowed their sceptre,7 and the shepherd his crook.8 If, abandoning mythological fictions which surround the olive with a charming but false poetry, we interrogate history for more certain in- formation concerning this revered tree, we shall find that Diodorus, of Sicily, informs us Minerva discovered and made known to the Athenians its useful qualities.9 And a writer, in whose possession the most ancient records in the world were found—Moses—who has recounted the birth of vegetation,10 tells us also of a patriarch pouring purified oil on a stone altar,11 before the olive tree was known in Athens—nay, before Athens existed. Profane historians honour Aristeus, son of Apollo, and King of Arcadia, with the invention of oil mills, and the manner of procuring the precious fluid,12 the abundance of which was such, in the East, that it was used in lamps,13 in anointing,14 in seasoning of dishes,15 and in nu- merous other instances too long to enumerate.10

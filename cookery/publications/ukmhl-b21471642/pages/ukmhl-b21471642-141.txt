KITCHEN GARDEN. 80 With garum, or oil and vinegar ;2H or with pepper, cummin-seed, and lentiscus (leaves of the mastic-tree).210 The water-cress par excellence grows in springs, rivulets, and ditches, in Europe. Its piquant taste is rather agreeable; it is eaten as a salad or seasoning, with poultry and other roasted meat. This plant increases the appetite, fortifies the stomach, and possesses anti-scorbutic qualities. A great consumption is made of it in certain countries. It is cultivated in running waters, either in gardens, or sown in the shade, where it is watered abundantly. The less it sees the sun, the softer it is.â€”Bosc.

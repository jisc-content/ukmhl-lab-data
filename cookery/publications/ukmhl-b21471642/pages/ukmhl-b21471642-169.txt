113 HP FRUIT. since Rubshakeh, the general of the Assyrian army, thought to seduce them from their obedience to Hezekiah, King of Judea, by saying to them : " Come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree "46 Thus the trade carried on with figs in Jerusalem had become so considerable and active, that Esdras was obliged to interdict it on the Sabbath day. It appears that figs were arranged in small masses, to which they give the form of loaves or cakes, either round or square, which were sold nearly in the same way as at the present day.47 From the East the fig tree passed into Greece, then into Italy, Gaul, Spain, and throughout Europe. The Athenians pretended that this tree was a native of their soil, and this people never wanted mythologic facts to support their asser- tions ; they imagined, and would have others believe, that the grateful Ceres rewarded the Athenian, Phytalus, for his hospitality by giving him a fig tree, which served for all the plantations of Attica.48 Whatever may be the way it came to them, they received it with transports of joy; it was planted with great pomp in the centre of the public square at Athens : from that time this spot was sacred to. them.49 Ere long the fame of the figs of Attica spread far and wide : they were the best in Greece; and the magistrates strictly prohibited their exportation.50 This law was afterwards modified, that is, the exportation of figs was allowed on payment of a very heavy duty. They then appointed inspectors, whose duty it was to discover con- traventions, and report them: thence arose the name of Sycophant,51 taken by those informersâ€”a vile and dispised set of men, whose denunciations were often false, and with whom the infamous authors of a base calumny were eventually assimilated.52 In Greece every one feasted on figs: it was a sort of regular gastro- nomic furore, which knew no bounds, and the wise Plato himself ceased to be a philosopher when presented with a basket of that fruit. As an aliment it was considered so wholesome and strengthening, that on the first introduction of them they constituted the food of the athlete, whose patron, Hercules, had also fed on them in his youth. The superiority of the Greek figs was so generally acknowledged that the kings of Persia even had a predilection for them : dried ones were served on the tables of these ostentatious princes.53

XXII. THE COOK. The author of a rare and very curious work,1 which no one at present has time to read, formed the charitable project of reconciling medicine and gastronomy. This was a noble enterprize, worthy of a true phi- lanthropist, and which assuredly presented less difficulties than people may think. In effect, what was the moot question? To agree, deforma, without interfering with the substance; to examine whether culinary preparations poison, as has been said, the food which nature gives us, and unceasingly paralyze the salutary action of the dietetic, which the faculty prescribe. For many centuries cooking has been exposed to these odious re- proaches, the gravity of which we do not pretend to attenuate; and yet, ever pursuing its brilliant career amidst revolutions and ruins, the ma- giric art, endowed with eternal youth, embellishes each new era of civi- lization, receives its most constant homage, and survives it when it fades away. Let us speak plainly: mankind has thrown on cooks all the faults of which they ought to accuse their own intemperance. It M'as no doubt easier, than to avoid the fatal abuse of pleasure, and the evils it brings with it; but there was the crying injustice, which we do not hesi- tate to denounce; there lay the obstacle it was necessary to overcome, in order to bring about a peaceful understanding between the disciples of Galen and the followers of Apicius. Gourmandise would never have rebelled against the kitchen if all polyphagists had obtained from the good Ceres the gift she granted to Pandareaâ€”a celebrated eater, who could pass days and nights at table, without experiencing the slightest indigestion.2 Q 2

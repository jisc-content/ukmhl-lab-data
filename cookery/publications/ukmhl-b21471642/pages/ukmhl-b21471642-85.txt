38 MANIPULATION OF FLOUR. Here the sparkling eyes of a rich epicurean were on the look out for some escarites, a very light paste, seasoned with new sweet wine and honey,30 and which was relished even by fatigued appetites at the close of a repast.31 The poorer people made their choice among heaps of dolyres, or typhes: they were coarse compounds of rye and barley ;32 the laches of fashion (petites mattresses) preferred the puff cakes called //lacites,33 or the sweet melitutes, whose exquisite and per- fumed flour was delicately kneaded with the precious honey of Mount Hymettus.34 Lastly, the robust workman of the Pyrseus bought the tyrontes, bread mixed with cheese,35 which the higher classes of society i n Athens abhorred, and which even the middling classes excluded from their tables. Let us add to this imperfect enumeration, that the Greeks baked their bread in several different manners: some in ovens, others under ashes, over charcoal, or between two pieces of iron, similar to our gauffre moulds, and under a bell, or cover of some metal with a rim round the top, and fire over it.36 For making a batch of bread, they employed nine pounds six ounces of leaven to twelve bushels of flour.37 With regard to their ovens, in the construction of which they excelled, they always took particular care to place them near a hand- mill,38 in order that the various processes that the wheat had to undergo should take place with ease and promptitude. The Romans were for a long time Pultipliagists, or eaters of gruel, &c. ;39 and it would be difficult to ascertain with accuracy the precise period at which they gave a preference to bread; they no doubt knew of it before the year 365 of Eome, for, at the siege of the Capitol by the Gauls, Jupiter, who protected the besieged, thought of nothing better to get them out of their difficulties than to appear at night to their general, Manlius, and to give him the following advice: "Make," said he, " bread with all the flour you have left in store, and throw it to the enemy to show them that Home has no apprehension of being reduced by famine." This stratagem, worthy of a Merry-Andrew, pleased Manlius so much, that he immediately put it into execution. The Gauls fled, Master Jupiter was highly delighted with the trick he had played, and thereby the Romans got rid of this swarm of barbarians.40 Whether this little story be true or not, the people of Romulus had a decided taste for gruel; it was a national dish, and was only discon- tinued to be given to the soldiers, defenders of the republic, when it was

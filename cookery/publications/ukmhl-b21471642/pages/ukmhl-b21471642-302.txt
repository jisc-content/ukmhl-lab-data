FISH. 230 old writer Belon, more wise in his conjecture, thinks this word comes from the Latin, macularelli, " little spots," because it is marked on the back with black stripes.180 Let the etymology be what it may, the epicurean cares very little about it. Mackerel was much liked in Greece, where it was believed to be a native of the Hellespont;187 and throughout Italy, where it was supposed to come originally from Spain.188 It is very probable that from mackerel was obtained one of the varieties of garum, known by the name of (/arum sociorum. Further on, we intend to devote a special chapter to the subject of this celebrated condiment. " Neither the size nor the weapons of mackerel make them formid- able;; they have, however, a violent appetite, and on account, perhaps, of the confidence they feel in the number of each shoal, they are bold and voracious, frequently attack fishes larger and stronger than them- selves, and even dart with blind audacity upon the fishermen who bathe where they happen to be. Thus Pontoppidan relates that a sailor, bathing in the port of Caroule, in Norway, missing one of his com- panions, saw him a few minutes afterwards dead, the body mangled and covered with a multitude of mackerel, tearing his remains to pieces."â€” Dr. Cloquet. HADDOCK. The haddock, like the sturgeon, was surrounded with the ridiculous honours of an almost divine pomp.189 It was served interwoven with garlands, and trumpeters accompanied the slaves who, with uncovered heads and foreheads crowned with flowers, brought to the guests this dish, the merit of which was, perhaps, exaggerated by capricious fancies.190 TENCH. Ausonius, who lived in the 4th century of the Christian era, is the first who has spoken of the tench, in his poem of the " Mosiella."1*1 It was abandoned to the common people, who alone feasted on it.192 This fish, long the victim of an unjust disdain, ultimately conquered from the great that esteem which they at first refused to it.

FISH. FROGS. The aucients thought nothing of frogs, which they left at liberty to propagate. There was such a great number among the Abderites, that these good people gave up to them their native soil, and left the place in search of another spot. At the present day, in some countries, frogs are sought for as a most agreeable and wholesome food; in other parts—England in particu- lar—they are disdainfully shunned. But in France there is a great consumption of them, especially in the spring. About a century since, they were greatly in fashion at Paris; and it is stated that a coun- tryman from the province of Auvergne, named Simon, made a consider- able fortune by feeding aud fattening them in one of the suburbs of that city, which were sent to him from Auvergne.

They are dressed with wine as fish, with white or brown sauce ; fried, or roasted; when tender, and properly done, it is a most delicate dish."—Bosc. Before the conclusion of this article, we may as well mention a frightful fish which modern good taste has banished from our tables, but which the ancients allowed to appear at theirs. It is the Polypus, highly esteemed both in Greece and Italy, when caught at a certain period, and its numerous immoderate legs stretched far over the edges of the dish prepared to receive it.271 This monster was cut in pieces, and eaten with a sauce composed of pepper, garum, and benzoin."2 It will be easily understood that ancient nations must have early ac- customed themselves to fishing, the origin of which, doubtless, goes back to the first ages of civilization. The holy writings often mention fishermen,278 fish-hooks, and nets. Homer speaks of them,27'1 and the poet, Eesiod, who flourished thirty years before Homer,275 places on the Q

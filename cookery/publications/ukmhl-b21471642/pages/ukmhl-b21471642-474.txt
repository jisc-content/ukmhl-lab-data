REPASTS. 350 It is to be remarked, that it is always a prince or a great personage who presents the wet napkin to him with which to wash his hands, whereas it is a simple valet who presents him with the dry napkin to wipe them. The king takes his seat. The equerry-carver carves the viands. The king serves himself on a plate of gold. When he asks for drink, the cup-bearer calls aloud: " Drink for the king !" At the same time he makes his obeisance to him, goes to the buffet, takes two crystal decanters, one of which is filled with wine, and the other with water, returns to the king, makes another obeisance, removes the cover of the glass, and presents it to the king, who pours out wine and water according to his own pleasure. During the dinner or supper of the king, a group of lordly courtiers stand behind his chair, and endeavour—though frequently in vain— to divert him, and make him laugh; and another group, composed of ladies of the court, stand behind the queen's chair, who, on their part, try to amuse her, and excite a smile. Whether the king eat in public or private, the table is always served in the same manner :— AT DINNER. TWO LARGE TERRINES OF SOUP. TWO MIDDLING-SIZED ONES. TWO SMALL ONES AS SIDE DISHES. FIRST COUESE. TWO LARGE DISHES. TWO MIDDLING-SIZED ONES. SIX SMALL ONES, AS SIDE DTSHES. SECOND COURSE. TWO LARGE DTSHES OF ROAST. TWO MORE, AS SIDE DISHES. AT SUPPER. The same number of dishes, only there is but three-fourths of the quantity of soup. The king eats only with the royal family and princes of the blood. Sometimes, however, the Pope's nuncio has the honour of sitting at his table, but always at the distance of four places.96 The luxury of the table was carried so far under Edward III. of England, that that prince was constrained, in the 17th year of his reign, to impose sumptuary laws on his subjects, forbidding the common people the indulgence of costly food and fine wines."

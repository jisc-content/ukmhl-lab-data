ANIMALS. THE OX. A profound sentiment of gratitude has been often the cause of ren- dering to the ox extraordinary honours, which no animal, perhaps, ever shared with him. The Egyptians considered this quadruped as the emblem of agriculture, and of aU that serves to support existence ;7i and incense smoked on its altars at Memphis and Heliopolis." The Phoenicians religiously abstained from its flesb, and the Phry- gians punisbed with death whosoever dared to slay the labouring ox.76 In Greece, during the heroic ages, an ox was the reward adjudged to the conquering wrestlers and pugilists; a horse was the prize of racing or the quoits.77 At a later period tbe Athenians decreed that their coins should bear the image of this useful quadruped ;78 and though they then offered it to their gods, the ceremonies even of the sacrifice testified the repug- nance felt at shedding its blood. The sacrificer fled with the greatest speed after he had struck it; he was followed, and, to avoid being arrested, he threw away the axe he had used, and accused it of causing tbe death of tbe innocent ox. The axe was then seized and tried; some one defended it, and alleged that i was less guilty than the grinder who had sharpened the blade. The latter cast the odium of the crime on the grinding stone, so that the trial was never ended, and the pretended offence remained unpunisbed.79 For a long time the greater part of the ancients considered it a sin to eat the flesh of the ox, the companion of the agriculturist, wbose patient vigour hollows the furrow which is to be the means of his support.80 But the bad example of Proserpine, who prepared one for Hercules,81 caused these scruples, one by one, to be hushed, the solemn prohibition of the legislator of Athens forgotten ;82 and, in spite of the obstinate resistance of the Pythagorians and the disciples of Enrpedocles, every one declared in favour of the doctriues of Zeno and Epicurus. Moreover, it is certain that the heroes of Homer were not so scrupulous: Menelaus offered roast-beef to Telemachus; Agamemnon also presented some to the wise Nestor; and an ox, roasted whole, fre- quently appeased the robust appetite of the illustrious chiefs of Greece.83

PISE. 243 The Greeks and Romans, like ourselves, were remarkably fond of this delicious shell fish, and eat them (French fashion) at the beginning of a banquet.221 For this reason Athenian epicures called oysters " the gastronomic prelude to the stopper." 222 They were often served raw,228 and were then dexterously opened by a slave on the table,224 in presence of the guests, whose experienced eyes greedily sought the light purple net which, according to them, surrounds the fattest and best.225 The inhabitants of Italy preferred large oysters,280 and exacted that this dainty manna of the sea227 should be always fresh and abundant at their feasts.228 This displayed wisdom on their part: this delightful fish excites the appetite and facilitates digestion.220 To add to its delicate flavour, the " Roman club of epicureans," a useful association, which modern Europe envies antiquity, caused to be sent from Spain, at a vast expense, that precious garum,230 the recipe of which seems to have been lost, and the condiment itself forgotten by the whole of the Peninsula. The magiric genius of Rome did not hesitate to demonstrate that oysters do not form an exception to the law of perfectibility which governs all beings, and that it is possible to render their flesh more suc- culent and delicate by transporting them from their damp cradle into reservoirs exposed to the mild influence of the sun.231 Sergius Orata or, perhaps, Fulvius Hirpinus, was the first who received this happy inspiration. He caused to be constructed, near Pouzzole, a short time before the civil war of Pompey, a fishpond, where be stowed oysters, which he fattened with paste and cooked wine worked into the con- sistence of honey232—sapa et farre. This worthy Roman enriched himself by the sale of them,233 and bequeathed a name to posterity —a two-fold happiness for the gastronomist Fulvius, whose good fortune the poet Homer did not partake. Apicius esteemed highly oysters from the lake of Lucriuus, from Brindes, and Abydos, and studied deeply the succulent qualities of this shell fish. He knew how to preserve them fat, fresh, and alive, during long and fatiguing journeys; and, thanks to a delicate attention on the part of this immortal boh vivant, the great Trajan was enabled to regale himself with oysters sent from Rome while carrying on a distant war against the Parthians.23* This present of the king of epicureans to the master of the world was worthy of both the giver and receiver, but it completed the rain of the generous Apicius.

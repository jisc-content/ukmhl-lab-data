fish. 242 having some sense of modesty left, would not award them, and the im- placable Caesar, from that moment, swore the ruin of the senators.213 The inhabitants of Greece and those of Italy thought a great deal of shell fish, which was always served at the beginning of the repast, just as they came from the sea: others cooked under the ashes, or fried. In most cases they were seasoned with cummin and pepper.214 The purveyors of fish in Eome gave the preference to those taken in the lake of Lucrinus.215 The Greeks esteemed those from the pro- montory of Polarea.216 The city of Baise, in Campania, celebrated for its charming position, and the unreserved lax manners of its inhabitants, was not less renowned for its culinary labours, and the nicety which presided over their joyful banquets. Apicius has left us the recipe of a most exquisite stew, emphractum, which the epicureans of Rome often went to degust among their rivals, the Campanian gastronomists. Cut up oysters, muscles, and sea-hedgehogs; let the pieces be rather small; put them into a stewpan with pine almonds, fried and chopped, some parsley, rue, pepper, coriander, and cummin; add, with proper care and discretion, some cooked wine, garum, and oil; cover, and boil the whole for a long time on a slow fire.217 We will point out the shell fish most in vogue in Italy, and for which the seasoning was generally composed of a mixture of pepper, parsley, dried mint, alisander, a great quantity of cummin, and a little of the decoction of spikenard.218 OYSTER; The pontiffs of pagan Rome, men of exquisite delicacy and matured taste, caused oysters to be served at every repast.219 This little piece of epicurism was very expensive, and it was necessary for these grave per- sonages to carry the whole of the devotion which characterized them in their love of good cheer to the highest degree, to dare eat of a dish still uncommon a century before the Christian era. At this epoch a borriche (a sort of basket) of oysters was worth one hundred sesterces (Â£Q).220 It is unnecessary to remark that the poor never tasted them.

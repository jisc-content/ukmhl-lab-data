X. PLANTS USED IN SEASONING. We will point out, as briefly as possible, those plants mostly used in the kitchens of the ancients to heighten the flavour of their dishes, or to give them a particular taste, according as the dish or fancy might require it. In them especially lies the secret of those irritamenta gulce, or excitements of the palate, which Apicius brought so much into fashion. POPPY. The seed of this plant was offered, fried, at the beginning of the second course, and eaten with honey.1 Sometimes it was sprinkled on the crust of a kind of household bread, covered with white of eggs.2 Some of it was also put into the panada, or pap, intended for children3â€” perhaps to make them sleep the sooner. SESAME. This seed was used in nearly the same manner as the poppy, and it occupied a distinguished rank among the numerous dainties served at dessert.4 Certain round and light cakes were covered with this seed.5 The Komans brought sesame from Egypt.6

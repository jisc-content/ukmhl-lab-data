WINE. 324 putting an end to the disorders caused by intemperance. It would have been preferable, says Plutarch, to have united.the nymphs -with Bacchus.28 The ingenious philosopher insists on the mixture being made by a fourth, a fifth, or an octave, in the same manner as the chords in music, which charm our ears. The fifth was obtained by pouring three measures of water on two of wine; one part water and two parts wine made the octave; a quarter of wine and three quarters of water produced the fourth,20'a most inharmonious chord, struck only by inexperienced and unskilful hands.

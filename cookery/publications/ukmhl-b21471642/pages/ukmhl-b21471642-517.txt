The upper part of the body was supported by the left elbow; the lower part was extended. The head was slightly raised, and. downy little cushions supported the back.56 When several persons occupied the same couch, the first placed himself at the head, in such a manner that his feet nearly reached the shoulders of the second guest, whose head was before the middle of the body of the preceding one, from whom he was separated by a cushion ; and his feet descended to the back of the third guest, who followed the same order with respect to the fourth.57 When a couch contained three persons, the one in the middle occu- pied the place of honour; when there were four, that distinction be- longed to the second.

50 VEGETABLES. invited these worthy personages to dinner, and, with the assistance of his friend, gave them a magnificent banquet, in which vegetables occupied a most conspicuous place.8 Sixteen Greek authors have devoted their vigils to profound re- searches concerning the qualities of these useful plants; then works have not been transmitted to us, but their names are to be found inscribed in the gastronomic treasure which Athensens—that grammarian, philosopher, and epicurean—has bequeathed to the meditations of posterity.9 But it is principally with the Romans that this interesting branch of the magiric art flourished. They have told us that this great family of herbs took the name of vegetables {legumina), because they were chosen and picked by the hand]10 and their most celebrated horticul- turists have prided themselves on the preparation of the ground to which they were confided, on the attention which they claimed, and on the Hygeian virtues which experience attributed to them.

302 A ROMAN SUPPER. Nos. 2 and 3. Silver dishes.—Gorrie, " Etruscan Mus." capons' livers/0 peppered becaficoes,01 grouse, the turtle-dove, the pheiiicopter,02 and an infinite number of rare birds, the costly tribute that Europe, Asia, and Africa, exchanged against the gold of the pro- digal Seba. Other gold and silver dishes contained those inestimable fishes which Roman luxury brought so much into fashion; the scarus, or parrot fish, sturgeons, turbots, mullets, and those numerous inhabit- ants of every sea with which the tanks were stocked, to supply the kitchen of the freed-slave.

Suddenly the symposiarch commands silence : the musicians obey —the slaves are motionless. "Let us drain our cups," said he, "in honour of Caesar. Let us celebrate the tenth anniversary of his glorious reign, and his happy return to the metropolis of the world. Let us drink, senators and knights, as many craters as there are letters in the cherished name of the emperor."7* Sense and reason must have succumbed, had the patrician assembly toasted Caius Lucius Domitius Nero: it would have been constructive treason not to empty twenty-three cups ; but they limited themselves to four, which represented the last of these names. Joy unrestrained floated with the fumy wine, furnished from large DESCRIPTION OF PLATE No. XXXI. No 1. Curious silver dish,' with Etruscan letters engraved around the head of Medusa.

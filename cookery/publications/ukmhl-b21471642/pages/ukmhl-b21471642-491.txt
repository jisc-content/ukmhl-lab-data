The ccenaculum (dining-room), properly so called, was the place in the upper part of the house where they eat.1 It was reached by a staircase,2 and thither persons repaired during the summer, particularly in the country. The Roman villas terminated by a platform, on which the Eomans often collected at meal-time; the air was not so hot, and the panorama of the neighbouring country-seats was presented without obstruction, to the gaze of the guests.3 The dining-room was commonly decorated with fasces of arms and trophies,4 which served as a momento of the warlike virtues of the ancestors of the master of the house.

Herodotus speaks of two cratcres, one containing 300 amphora;, and the other COO ; these vases commonly ex- ceeded ten-fold the size of the cups, to which they were very similar in shape and handles. No. 2. A glass vose, with two handles, for iced water. No. 3. Glass bottle, with its cup, placed on the table for each guest. x 2

FEATHERED GAME. 195 Among the Romans, Pliny is the first (or -we are mistaken) who mentions this bird, then very uncommon in Italy, since they went in quest of it to the banks of the Phasis.13 Its rarity did not prevent Vitellius from having a ragout of pheasants' brains,u mixed with other viands of an unheard-of delicacy, in the immense dish called by him " the Shield of Minerva."15 Pertinax willingly partook of pheasant, but on condition that they cost his miserly sensuality nothing. Heliogabalus would only eat them three times a week. Alexander Sevems reserved them for solemn occa- sions.16 They were sacrificed each morning to the statue of Caligula,17 at the foot of which the vile troop of courtiers prostrated themselves at the very time even when Csesar, in a fit of sanguinary monomania, wished that the Roman people had but one neck, that he might sever it at a blow.18 It is especially from the commencement of the 14th century that the jDheasant, better appreciated in Europe, has resumed in banquets that remarkable place,19 constantly assigned to it throughout this new era, in which our taste maintains it, and from which our posterity will never remove it, if they inherit that wonderful sentiment of the good and beautiful which so eminently distinguishes the epicures of the present day. Let us add, for the comfort of weak stomachs, that the medical light of Pergamo—the illustrious Galen—recommends them the use of the flesh of pheasants ;20 that he prescribed it for himself, and found it a most delightful remedy. " Mingrelia, or the antique Colchis, is the cradle of pheasants, that species of birds being stronger and finer there than anywhere else, but it is seen, however, all over Europe, in Africa, and Asia, even in the cold countries of the north. This beautiful bird forms an article of com- merce with the Chinese, who sell them frozen in the market of Kiakta."—Sonnini. THE PAliTRIDGE. The Greeks and Romans were acquainted with partridges, and eat them.21' The red, at first very rare in Italy, were, however, advan- tageously replaced by the white, which true amateurs procured at a great expense from the Alps.2:

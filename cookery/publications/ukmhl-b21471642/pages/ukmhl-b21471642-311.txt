2 15 fish. SEA-HEDGEHOG. Under this denomination were classed all animals, more or less orbicular, whose envelope bristles with calcareous points, on which account they were compared to hedgehogs. The Greeks thought them delicious when caught at the full moon,543 and prepared with vinegar, sweet cooked wine, parsley, and mint.244 Oxymel often replaced vinegar.245 The Romans also esteemed highly this dish, which was recom- mended to sluggish appetites under the auspices of the faculty ;246 and Apicius furnished the following recipe for the preparation of it:â€” " Procure a new saucepan," thus says the great master, " place in it a little oil, garum, sweet wine, and pepper. When the mixture begins to boil, stuff the sea hedgehogs, then submit them to the action of a slow fire ; add a large quantity of pepper, and serve." 247 MUSSEL. The two great nations of antiquity have granted uncommon praise to mussels, and partook of them at their most sumptuous feasts. At the wedding repast of the graceful Hebe, Jupiter wished the inhabitants of Olympus to exchange for this shell fish their celestial though mono- tonous ambrosia.248 Epicharmus, who records the fact, does not inform us with what sauce the chef de cuisine of the gods dressed the flesh of those mussels. The reader must thus content himself with the seasoning invented by simple mortals, and which appeared good to them. It was composed of a suitable mixture of pepper, alisander, parsley, mint, with a quantity of cummin seed, a little honey, vinegar, and garum.240 With this mixture they covered the boiled and widely opened mussels, and the guests found it impossible to satiate themselves with this dish, so much more digestible and nourishing than oysters.'"0

SEASONINGS. 275 SUGAR. Theophrastus, the first among the ancients who speaks of sugar, classes it among the number of honeys." Dioscorides also calls it " honey of reeds;" he adds that these reeds grow in India, or in Arabia Felix,, and that the agreeable substance they contain has some analogy with salt.08 Pliny also gives it the same name. It is, according to this naturalist, a kind of honey, with which certain reeds are filled, and used only in medicine.69 This was also the opinion of many ancient authors ;70 one of whom, Paul Eginetta, calls sugarâ€”Indian salt.71 The sugar cane appears to be originally a native of the East Indies. From the most remote ages the Chinese have understood the art of cultivating it. The histories of the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Jews, make no mention of it. The Greek physicians are the first who speak of it. It was not till the year 1471 that a Venetian discovered the method of purifying brown sugar and making loaf sugar. He gained an immense fortune by this discovery.72 Sugar cane, well purified, and disburthened.of all foreign matter, is white, solid, inodorous, soluble in water, of a soft and agreeable savour. Its specific gravity is 1.00G5; it is used as a seasoning in a multitude of dishes, in preparing syrups, preserving of fruits, &c, &c. CINNAMON. In the time of Theophrastus, it was said that cinnamon grew in a dark and silent valley, guarded night and day by fearful serpents. Ani- mated by the hope of gain, some individuals, careless of their existence, risked their lives by gathering some of this precious bark. When they had the good luck to avoid the vigilant reptiles, they consecrated to the sun part of their booty, which the radiant orb immediately consumed to prove his acceptance of the offering.73

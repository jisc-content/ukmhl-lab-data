XXVII. DRINKING CUPS. If men were wiser, the 19th century would probably not have seen a beneficent apostle preaching temperance everywhere, and making his name cherished and celebrated by a series of successes which could hardly have been expected; numerous societies of Hydropotes, or " teetotallers," would not alarm, in our days, those joyful disciples of Bacchus's temple, hydrophobes by profession, by taste, and interest, who sincerely bewail the desertion of newly made abstemious members; and no person would promise, by a solemn and formidable pledge, to forego the drinking of anything but water! The abuse must have been very great, since it was necessary to have recourse to such a remedy. It is true that the evil had taken deep root, and that the most ancient people, the gods, and the heroes, have left us examples of this dangerous seduction. The Scythians, the Celts, Iberians, and Thra- cians,1 were confirmed drunkards. The wise Nestor himself, who was so good a match for Agamemnon, often felt some difficulty in finding his tent.2 Alexander the Great slept sometimes two days and two nights, after having paid too much devotion to the god of good cheer;3 and Philip, his father, very frequently left the table with a very heavy head and staggering legs.4 It is reported that Dionysius the Younger, tyrant of Sicily, lost his sight through drinking too much, which will not be wondered at, if DESCRIPTION OF PLATE No. XVIII.

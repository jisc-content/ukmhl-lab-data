ANIMALS. 148 If we go back to centuries still more remote, and of which a venerable historian has preserved us an account, we find herds of oxen were possessed by the great patriarchal families.* 84 Abraham cooked a calf and served it to the three angels, in the valley of Mamre ;85 and the flesh of this animal, whether ox or heifer, was evidently much in use in the primitive ages, since no particular proscription exempts them from those beings having " life and motion,sr' and which are to serve us as food.87 As to Moses, far from interdicting it to the Israelites, he places the ox in the first rank of pure animals,88 whose flesh was allowed them. The oracle of ancient medicine, Hippocrates, praises the flesh of the ox, in which he recognises the most nutritious qualities, but never- theless he believes it to be heavy and indigestible.89 Of what material, then, must have been the stomach of Theagenes, of Thasos—he, who devoured a whole bull in one day.90 To be sure, the same exploit is attributed to Milo of Crotona, whose ordinary meal consisted of eighteen pounds of meat, as much bread, and fifteen pints of wine.91 These formidable polyphagists could, without much expense, indulge their fabulous appetites; for, in the time of Demosthenes, 854 B.C., an ox of the first quality cost only eighty drachmas, or about two pounds, eleven shillings, and eight- pence.92 Magiric writers have left us very few details on the different methods of cooking the flesh of the ox or calf. It appears to have been generally roasted,93 in which case it was eaten alone; but sometimes it was eaten boiled, with one of the sauces to be hereafter mentioned. These animals were fed with particular care, in order to render them more worthy of the luxurious tables for which certain choice pieces were destined. The manner of fattening oxen has already been described: it is only necessary to add, that calves, which were to be slaughtered, received no other food than their mothers' milk ; and that, frequently, they were not killed before the expiration of a twelvemonth.94 Double tripe was reputed as an excellent food. The Asiatics, « The word Ox—Bos—is a general term applied equally by sacred and profane writers to the bull, ox, and cow.—Valla, lib. iv., cap. 42. It would appear that the castration of bulls originated with the Greeks, though they and the Romans, their imitators, saw only in this operation the facility of subduing them, and accustoming them to the yoke.— GiiOPONlCS, Columella, Pliny, &&

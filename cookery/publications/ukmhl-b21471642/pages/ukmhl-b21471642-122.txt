06 KITCHEN GARDEN. GOURD. This vegetable, which the wise gourmet is too discreet to despise, and to which the whimsical fancy of Eoman gardeners gave the most grotesque forms,56 appears to be the very image of those soft and easy dispositions who yield to and obey every one, and whose unintelligent mildness is only repaid with sarcasm or disdain.

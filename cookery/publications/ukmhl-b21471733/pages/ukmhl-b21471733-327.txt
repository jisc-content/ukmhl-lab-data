29 T 543—Orange Hearts. Take half a pound of sugar, two ounces of s-weet almonds, two caps of preserved orange peel, pound them together, with twelve yolks of eggs, the raspings of two lemons, and a little orange flower water; mix all well together in a pan with a wooden spad- dle, beating it for half an hour: when the paste is very light whisk the whites of six eggs to a strong froth, and stir it into the paste, turning it over gently till they are well mixed; then sift in six ounces of flour, and stir it as lightly as possible; butter your heart tins, fill them with the mixture, sift fine sugar over them, and bake them with paper under the tins. 544—Ratafie Cakes. Blanch half a pound of sweet and half a pound of bitter al- monds, dry them for some hours in the hot closet; take two pounds of loaf sugar in a lump, pound the almonds and sugar together, till it may be all sifted through a fine wire sieve; when it is all sifted return it back again into the mortar, and with a strong wooden spaddle mix in as much white of egg, one or two at a time, as will make the almonds into paste; work it well with the spaddle till the paste becomes perfectly smooth : you should have a bladder with a tin pipe fastened to one end; put some of the paste into the bladder, and force it through the pipe in drops on sheets of paper ; bake them, and when cold take them off the paper, and keep the cakes in dry boxes. Several kinds of al- mond cakes may be made in this way, using sweet almonds onlv, and in some cases introduce a little orange flower water. Observe, never to use any thing that is in the least greasy in mixing these kinds of almond cakes, for it would cause them to run.

153 24S—Skate au Beurre Noir. (With Black Butter.) Boil the skate in salt and water, let it drain, and dish it; fry some parsley in butter, put the parsley in the middle of the dish, and pour the butter round the fish. 2^^—Of Pipers. Though this fish does not class high in estimation, yet it is by no means to be neglected, and if well dressed is superior to many. When the fish is thoroughly cleansed put in them a well- seasoned veal stufl&ng; butter a saute pan, lay the fish on it, sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and cover them with well- buttered paper; put the fish thus prepared in the oven, and bake them half an hour: serve them either with a brown Italian sauce (No. 183), or a Dutch sauce (No. 211). The piper is good eating dressed in fillets as you would soles. Of Carp, It is to be observed, that almost all fresh water fish that are stewed are dressed in a braise or marinade, composed of wine, broth roots, herbs, and spices ; the precise quantity of each must de- pend on the size and quality of the fish. The cook's skill will develope itself when the sauce is presented; each ingredient being so harmonized as to taste of every thing, yet no one predo- minant. M

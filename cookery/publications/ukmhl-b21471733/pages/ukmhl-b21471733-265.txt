229 then press out the water from them; have ready a cask suffi- ciently large to contain the quantity of cabbage you intend to prepare ; put in a layer of salt at the bottom, on which you lay some of the sliced cabbage, on this moi-e salt, and another layer of cabbage; you may throw in some whole pepper and a few juniper berries; continue to put a layer of cabbage and a little salt until the cask is full; have a piece of wood cut just large enough to go into the top of the cask, put it on the cabbage with a heavy weight, at least a hundred weight: in a short time the water extracted will form a sort of crust on the top ; this should be poured off; by this time the kraut is fit for use : be careful when you take out any of the kraut to cover it again, and place the weight on : when you use the sour kraut let it steep some hours in cold water to take out the salt; then squeeze out all the water; put it into a stewpan, with a good piece of butter, and a ladleful of broth; stew it until tender, and serve it with bacon, salt pork, or sausages.

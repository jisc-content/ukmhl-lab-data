7 It is the usual custom to cover the table with only the same number of dishes in the second course which you have in the first, but this is not always to be a rule, especially in small dinners, as it will unavoidably occur that you are sometimes obliged to dress as large a joint for six persons as you would require for ten ; consequently, where two entrees would be sufl&cient for the first coiirse, only two entremets for the second course would cover the table very scantily; and it is to be observed also, that second course dishes are smaller than those used for the first course. From these considerations I have commenced giving my first bill of fare, for two entrees in the first, and four entremets in the second course. ' For the sake of regularity, I shall here observeâ€”having made your bill of fare, and it being approved of, I would advise that a marketing list should be prepared of what is required to dress for dinner, supposing yourself to be in London, without the resources usually met with in the country, Avhere you may have a well-stocked garden, farm, and poultry yard. In Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, are given directions for preparing broth, consomme, and two general sauces. I shall now proceed to give directions for dressing each dish set forth in the preceding bill of fare; ray great object in so doing is to fix the mind to one day's occupation, and after the performances of the day are over, I would recommend a careful perusal of all that has been done during the day; and if in any thing you have not succeeded to your wishes, trace the cause, and by so doing you will derive the benefit and improvement required, and you will find that the next and succeeding dinners, though increased, become more easy than the first. If you desire to change any dish, take from the next or any of the following bills of fare a dish corresponding with the one you wish to alter, and by that means you will be enabled to make a variety of bills of fare without confusion; only observe that you select such things as are in season. nl'l ' M T-f """^^'^^^ -months,. namely, March, April, and May.

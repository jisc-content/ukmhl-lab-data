205 ALOUETTES EN RAGOUT. 373—Ragout of Larks. Take a dozen of larks, bone them, and put in each a little veal farce (No. 304); form them of a good shape, butter the bottom of a stewpan, place in the larks, and fry them to fix their shape; then cover them with consomme, close the stewpan, and place them over a slow stove; when they are done remove them into a clean stewpan, put a few spoonsful of sauce tournee (No. 6) to the consomme they were done in, let it boil on the corner of the stove to throw off the fat, and reduce the sauce to a good con- sistence ; strain it through a tammy into the stewpan with the larks, have ready some truffles and mushrooms, put them into the sauce, also a braised sweetbread, cut in square pieces ; let all boil up together, skim the sauce, and dish them neatly: or they may be served in a croustade of bread (No. 387). ALOUETTES EN CAISSES. 374—LarTis in Cases. If the preceding entree is returned to the kitchen untouched, the larks may be served another time in cases; warm the larks in the sauce, have paper cases ready, place one lark in each case, and strew them over with fried crumbs; serve them as hot as possible. 375—Venison. It is usual to commence killing stall-fed venison on the first of May.

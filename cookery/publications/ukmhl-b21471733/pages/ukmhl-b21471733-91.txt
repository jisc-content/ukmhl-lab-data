65 SOUPE AU VERMICELLI A LA REINE. 85—Vermicelli, Queens way. Make a rich consomme of veal, fowl, and good flavoured ham, soak the meat for an hour with some light broth, and when the juice is reduced to a pale glaze, cover the meat with some very delicate beef broth, put in a bunch of sweet herbs, that is—a sprig of basil, sweet marjorum, half a dozen spring onions, a little parsley, half a dozen cloves, and a leaf of mace; let the con- somme boil an hour, take off the grease, then pass it through a napkin, boil some vermicelli in water, and afterwards throw it into cold water; then drain all the water from it, and put it into the consomme ; let it boil by the side of the stove till tender : when you serve the soup, mix a table spoonful of arrow root with half a pint of cream that has been boiled; just when you dish the soup, pour this in, and let it boil up: add a little salt if necessary. 86—Soup Sante. Take two quarts or more of good consomme, perfectly free from grease, let it boil, add the least quantity of sugar, and also a little salt if required; cut the crust of some French rolls and pare them of the thickness of a sixpenny piece, put them in the tureen, and serve the soup boiling upon the bread.

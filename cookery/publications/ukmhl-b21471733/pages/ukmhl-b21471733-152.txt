116 sible, and which is to be scalded with great attention that none of the hair remains ; saw the head in two parts from the pole to the nose, take out the brains without breaking them (they serve for an entree), wash the head in several waters, then put it into a soup pot, with cold water, over a brisk fire, pay particular attention to the scum rising that you may remove it thoroughly, otherwise if it boils into the broth it would stick to the head and not be easily cleaned off; throw into the broth some carrot, onions, and a bunch of turtle herbs, such as basil, thyme, marjoram, and parsley, and a few cloves and mace; boil the head till it feels tender, but not to be done too much, for it has to be boiled again in the soup; draw out the bones, skin the tongue and palate, and throw the head into a large pan of cold water; when it is cold cut it up in pieces about an inch square, place them on dishes, and put them in the larder until you have made ready the sauce. Put into a broth pot a large knuckle of voal, two pounds of lean ham of good flavour, some onions, carrots, mace and cloves, and a bunch of turtle herbs ; to which put a quart ladleful of the broth the head was cooked in, set it over the fire to soak, fre- quently moving the meat that it may not stick ; when this is re- duced to a glaze, then cover the meat with the remainder of the broth, and let it boil on the corner of the stove for two hours ; it is then to be passed through a sieve or napkin. Now take a stewpan that will hold as much soup as you intend to make, put into it a lump of fresh butter, melt it, and add as much flour as it will absorb ; stir it constantly over the fire till it begins to turn brown, then moisten it gradually with the broth you have passed ; when it boils draw it one side the stove and let it boil slowly; put in some mushroom parings, also more herbs and spice, if requisite â€¢ the sauce must be sufficiently thin to throw up the grease, which is to be carefully removed, and then pass the sauce into a clean soup pot through a tammy; put in the head which you have prepared, some farce meat and egg balls, made as di- rected in Nos. 158 and 159 : let the soup boil for half an hour,

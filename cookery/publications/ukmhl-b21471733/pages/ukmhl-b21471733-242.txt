The breast of venison is usually taken to make a haricot: trim off the brisket bones and skin of two breasts of venison, or use one breast and part of the neck, which is better; cut the breast into six or seven cutlets, and as many from the neck; cut all the flesh you can from the scrag end and with it line the bottom of a stewpan, upon which you lay the cutlets; season them well with pepper and salt, lay the bones and trimmings upon the top, put in a carrot and two onions, and a ladleful of broth; cover the stewpan close, and set it over a quick fire, and boil it till it is reduced to a glaze; then fill up the stewpan with more broth, and let it stew slowly ; when the venison is quite tender pick out the pieces and put them in a clean stewpan, sift the broth, skim off the fat, and pour it again over the meat; add more seasoning, and dish the venison in its own juice : in this way the real lovers of venison would eat it, but as it is the practice to serve this dish with roots and a thickened sauce, I have only to observe, that the sauce is to be thickened by passing a little butter, flour, and roots, and added the same as directed for haricot of mutton. For a venison pasty prepare the venison as here directed; but it must be 'more highly seasoned when it is to be eaten cold : raise the crust of hot paste (No. 462), then lay in the venison, alter- nately fat and lean, till the pie is as full as you require it, cover it in with more of the paste, and bake the pie for an hour; reduce the sauce, and when you take the pasty out of the oven by degrees fill in the whole of the venison gravy; let it stand till it is cold, then take off" the top, and if any fat remain on the top, it may be easily removed.

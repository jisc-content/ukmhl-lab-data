155 BROCHET. 252—Pike Caught in rivers and clear water are preferable to those taken in muddy ponds, they are sweeter and firmer: a pike about twelve pounds is most esteemed ; however, the larger ones will be tender by keeping some time after they are dead : they spawn in March, when they are flabby and tasteless. 253—Pike d la Polonaise, Polish loay. Scale and wash the pike, cut it up as if for a matelotte ; put a quarter of a pound of butter at the bottom of a stewpan that will hold the slices, with two carrots, some parsley roots, green parsley, and onions; add a little mace, cloves, and bay-leaf; set the stew- pan on a slow fire to fry the slices, then pour in a ladleful of light broth, and let the fish boil about twenty minutes; strain the marinade in which the slices have been cooked, put a little butter and flour into a stewpan over a slow stove, and moisten with the marinade, first skimming ofi'the grease ; when the sauce boils pour in half a pint of cream that has already been boiled and a few mushroom parings ; reduce the sauce to a good consis- tence, that it may hang about the fish, and pass it through a tammy; cut some turnips into dice, stew them in a little broth and sugar; drain them and throw them into the sauce : dish the slices of pike, and cover them with the sauce and turnips ; add a little sugar and salt if required.

303 loaf sugar, broken small; put it again over the fire, and when it boils skim it, and let it boil for a quarter of an hour, skimming it the whole time; pour it into jelly pots, and when cold cut pieces of paper the size of the pots; dip them in brandy, and lay it over the jelly, and more paper over the pots. 675—Black Currant Jelly Is made in the same way as the preceding jelly. 576—Apple Jelly. Pare and cut the apples, put them into cold water sufficient to cover them, boil them till they are quite a pulp, then throw them into a jelly bag; to every pint of juice add twelve ounces of fine sugar, boil it till you find it begins to jelly ; the length of time depends upon the sort of apples used; try it, by occasionally dropping a little of the jelly on a cold plate or marble slab : this jelly is extremely useful in the kitchen for garnishing pastry or compotes. 577—Raspberry Jelly Is a currant jelly flavoured with raspberries, one part rasp- berries to three of currants.

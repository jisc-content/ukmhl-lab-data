ITS 175—Cheese Soup, d la Biberon. Peel and slice six onions, cut half a pound of lean ham in slices, and two ounces of butter; put them into a stewpan over the fire, and rub it with a spoon till the onions become a little brown; then add half a pound of bread crumbs, and three pints of good broth, a little cayenne pepper, and a blade of mace; let this boil for half an hour, then add a quarter of a pound of grated parmasan cheese, and pass the soup through a tammy; put it into a clean soup-pot, make the soup hot without boiling, and thicken it with the yolks of six eggs, mixed with a little broth ; cut crumb of bread in dice, fry them in clarified butter, and serve in the soup; first soak the bread in the broth, and put it in the soup the last moment. This is a good winter soup. 176—Hochepot of Mutton. Trim a neck of mutton into tolerably thick cutlets, braise them tender between slices of fat bacon, with carrots, onions, turnips, a bunch of parsley, and two sj)rigs of thyme; when the cutlets are done, take them out and press them between two dishes, and trim them when cold; put some good broth to the braise they were done in, let it boil, skim off the fat, and pass the broth through a napkin into a clean soup-pot; cut into dice some car- rots, turnips, and celery; blanch them and throw them into the soup, let them boil in the broth till quite tender, skim it well, and season it with salt and sugar, and just before you serve it put in the cutlets some boiled peas, then put them into the tureen ; also small lumps of cauliflower, well boiled, and pour the hoche- pot upon it. You may serve in this soup tendons of veal instead of mutton, or members of poultry cooked very tender.

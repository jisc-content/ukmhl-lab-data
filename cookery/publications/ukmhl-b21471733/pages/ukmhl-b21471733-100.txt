parsley, and three pints of rich consomme : boil all together for twenty minute.s then strain it to the fish, chicken, &c. which you have prepared; have also ready pounded, with a small piece of butter, the spawn of lobster: mix all together, and stir it over the stove till quite hot, and then pass it through a tammy, and turn it into a soup pot; make it hot by putting the soup pot in boiling water; a few minutes before the soup is served, lay in the Cray fish : add a little salt if required. 99â€”Tench d la Royale. Thoroughly cleanse a brace of tench, and put them into a stew, pan just large enough to contain them, as you are to dress the fish in wine only ; then pour over the tench as much red wine as will just cover them, put in a bunch of green onions, a little parsley, and spice; set the stewpan over a brisk stove to boil up quickly, then take the pan off the fire, and set it by the side to boil slowly for half an hour: take a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, melt it in a stewpan, add as much flour as it will take to dry it up, stir it over the fire for a short time, then pour the wine the fish has been stewing in, with a ladleful of consomme, to the flour and butter, stir it till the sauce boils, and then let it boil slowly, to throw off" the grease; add some parings of mushrooms, and a little spice; skim the sauce thoroughly, and pass it through a tammy into a clean stewpan; prepare some small mushrooms fried in butter, some button onions also fried, and a few quenelles of fish, and cray fish tails; these are to be thrown into the sauce, and served over the fish ; add a little cayenne and lemon juice to the sauce the last thing.

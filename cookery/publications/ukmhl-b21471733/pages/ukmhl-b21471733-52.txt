18 of cold water, put it on a quick stove to boil, and then put them into a bason of cold water; line another stewpan with slices of fat bacon, trim the tendrons neatly, lay them in the stewpan with two carrots, an onion, a blade of mace, and a small bunch of sweet herbs; cover all with more bacon, strain the water they were blanched in, and lay over the whole a piece of white paper, cut to the size of the stewpan ; they will take about four hours, slowly stewing : when they are done, take them up and put them into a small saute pan, with thin glaze, in which they are to be warmed; lay them tastefully round the dish, and serve with cucumber (No. 209) or any other sauce. PETIT CROQUETTES DE VOLAILLE. 25â€”Small Croquettes of Poultry. If you have any poultry left from a previous dinner, it will be equally good for this dish as a fresh fowl; pick out all the white meat, and mince it very finely with a knife; it should not be chopped, it makes the meat ragged; reduce a little bechamel sauce (No, 7), season it, and throw in the fowl you have minced ; then spread it on a dish, and when quite firm and cold, make them up in round balls, or small long puddings; roll them separately in bread crumbs, make them of a neat shape, beat up one or two eggs (yolk and white) on a plate with your knife, and with a paste brush cover the croquette all over with the egg, and again roll them in bread crumbs ; put them on a dish in the larder until dinner time, fry them of a nice colour, not too brown ^ind serve them on a napkin with fried parsley.

284 523—Brown Bread Ice Cream. Take a pint of good double cream, whip it strong, and sweeten it to your taste; proceed to freeze it as directed in No. 518 ; when frozen, work in some brown bread previously dried in the oven, and pounded into crumbs. You can make many different creams, by introducing various flavours, such as orgeat, mars- chino, noyeau, orange flower, &c. Strawberry, raspberry, cur- rant, and various other fruit ice creams are made by expressing the juice from the fruit, and mix it with cream. Water ices are excellent, and particularly refreshing, especially in the season when you can prociire fresh fruit. 524—Strawberry Water Ice. Express the juice of strawberries through a fine sieve, and add to the juice sufficient clarified sugar to sweeten it; squeeze in a little lemon juice to revive the flatness of the fruit, and ice it; if it does not freeze enough, it is a proof the ice is over rich, therefore add a little water ; if it freezes too much, it is necessary to add more syrup. Raspberry, currant, cherry, and mulberry water ices are made as above. 525—Apricot Water Ice. Take ripe apricots, pass the pulp through a hair sieve, and pound the kernels with a pint of water ; strain it through a sieve to the apricot, add some lemon juice and syrup sufficient to sweeten it, and put it into the freezing pot and work it as directed in No. 518.

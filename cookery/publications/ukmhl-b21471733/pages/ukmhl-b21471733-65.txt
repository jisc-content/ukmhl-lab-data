I 31 then wash the rice in several waters, and, lastly, in boiling water; put the rice into a stewpan large enough to hold four quarts, with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, an onion with a few cloves stuck in it, a leaf of mace, and about three pints of milk; set the whole over a brisk stove, and keep stirring it with a wooden spoon till it boils; the stewpan should then be covered close, to confine the steam, and placed over a slow stove, to allow the rice to swell; if you find the rice will absorb more milk, add it; but when you perceive the grains are perfectly tender, then remove it from the stove, and take the onion and spice out, and immediately work the rice into the shape you wish, or press it close into a mould, which should previously be rubbed with sweet oil. If you intend to serve your casserole white, the rice should be ready only about an hour before dinner -time; but if brown, it will be better to make it in the middle of the day, that it may be quite cold : when it is turned out of the mould, then with a paste-brush rub it over with yolk of egg, bake it in a quick oven, take care it is a nice colour; then take out as much of the inside as you can, leaving sufficient to keep the wall secure from bursting, and fill the casserole with scollops of sweetbread. Blanch one or two sweetbreads ; after they have remained some time in cold water to draw out the blood, put them into a stewpan lined with fat bacon, and over them more bacon, a little spice, an onion, a bunch of parsley, and two or three spoonsful of broth; cover the stewpan close, and set it over the fire for half an hour; try if they are tender, for they should not be too much done, or they would break in the sauce; put them away in the braise, and when cold trim and cut them in neat collops; have ready some bechamel sauce (No. 7), reduced with a little cream, throw the collops into it, and give them a boil up; season with a little salt, and then put them into the casserole. N.B. It is the practice to use the skimming of the broth-pot to soak the rice, but I prefer milk and butter, as being more delicate.

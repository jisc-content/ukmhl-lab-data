200 baking; if larger, of course they require more time : when quite cold, fill the pots up with melted lard, and tie them down with bladders. If you are where game is plentiful, instead of veal use the flesh of game for the farce, which is infinitely better than veal, and of course you preserve a better flavour of the game. With the bones and trimmings of the game you make an excel- lent glaze; put them into a stewpan with slices of veal and ham, with a ladleful of good broth (use no vegetable or spice), set the stewpan over a stove to soak for an hour, then fill up the stewpan with good broth, boil it for two hours, then strain the broth, skim off the fat, and reduce it to glaze: this glaze will be found to be exceedingly convenient to use in all game entrees. 360—Potted Grouse, a la Perigord. When you are so situated as to be well supplied, make the farce which you would use for potting of the flesh of the birds : in the first place, bone as many grouse as you intend to keep whole, and take all the flesh from the remaining birds, which you use instead of veal, and proceed as directed (No. 359). 361—Farce de Godiveau. Take one pound of lean veal, half a pound of beef suet, and half a pound of fat bacon, and chop them together perfectly fine; chop some parsley, shalots, and mushrooms, pass them in a little butter over the fire for ten minutes, then mix it with the meat and a little of the prepared seasoning (No. 390), and pound all together with two eggs; then bake a small piece, to try if it is sufiiciently seasoned : this farce is used for patties a la godiveau, or for pies which are for immediate use.

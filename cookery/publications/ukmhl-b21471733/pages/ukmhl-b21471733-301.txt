I would recommend those who are not expert in the art to begin with i^pinning the caramel inside the mouhl, as they mny better strengthen any defective part: the sugar being ready warmed have a spoon and dip it into the sugar, raising your arm ; and if it runs in fine threads take the mould in the othei- hand, and by moving the right hand backwards and forwards spinning the sugar inside the mould in threads as fine as possibhi, taking care to let none of it fall in drops ; when the mould is liompletely covered in every part, let it cool, and very carefully remove it from the shape; if there are any defective parts warm the sugar again, put the basket back into the shape, and amend the fault by spinning more sugar over it; then place the mould in a stewpan that you can cover close to exclude the air, and leave it till dinner time; then take it out of the mould, jDlace it on the dish, and fill the basket with extremely light pastry.

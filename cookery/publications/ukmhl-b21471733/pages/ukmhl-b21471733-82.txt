4G sieve; mix one ounce of melted isinglass; then take a pint of thick cream, whip it well upon ice, mix in gently the fruit and isinglass; when well mixed, put it into the mould, and surround the mould with ice. 71—Orange Jelly. One dozen of oi-anges, if they are fine and juicy, will be suffi- cient for a mould of jelly. Peel six of them as thin as possible, put the peel into a small stewpan, pour a teacupful of boiling water on it, and cover the pan close, so as to confine the steam; squeeze and pass the juice through a silk sieve, dissolve about one pound of sugar in half a pint of cold water, with the white of an egg beat in it; set it over a stove, and when it boils take off the scum, and let the sugar boil until it becomes thick, and when nearly cold, pour in as much as will sufficiently sweeten the jelly; also the zest of the peels; dissolve two ounces of isinglass (see No. 491), and mix all together: observe that the syrup, the essence from the peel, and the isinglass, should be mixed with the orange juice as cold as possible, otherwise you destroy the colour and the fine flavour which the jelly should retain. 72—Madeira Wine Jelly. Boil four calves' feet, and proceed as for calf's-foot jelly (No. 492), leaving out the lemon-peel and cinnamon, and adding a bottle of Madeira wine.

157 258—Perc/i. Perch out of rivers or clean running waters are best ; those of marshy pools or muddy ponds are apt to have a disagreeable taste ; when pretty large and fat they are held in high estima- tion ; the flesh is white and delicate, it is easily digested, and par- ticularly recommended to those invalids who have weak and debilitated stomachs. 259—Perch plain Boiled, or Water Sachet. Scale, empty, and wash the perch ; put them into a stewpan, with a bunch of parsley, a few grains of whole pepper, a little salt, and as much water as you find will be necessary to cover the fish ; let it boil fifteen minutes, take out the parsley and pepper corns, put the perch into the water, and let them boil briskly, as the fish will be more firm ; cut some parsley roots into long slips very fine, also blanch some sprigs of parsley, both of which you boil with the perch; serve the perch in a deep dish with the liquor and roots with it: send up slices of bread and butter on a plate to eat with the suchet. 260—Perch a la Maitre d"Hotel. The perch are to be cooked as above ; after you have drained the fish dish them, and pour over them maitre d'hotel sauce (No. 210).

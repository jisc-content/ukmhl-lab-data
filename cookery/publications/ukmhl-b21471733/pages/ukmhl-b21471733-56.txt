22 32—Gratin of Lobster. Cut a lobster, that has heen boiled, in two, without breaking the shell, clean and trim the shell, and mince the flesh; then take a little rich bechamel (No. 7), season it pretty tasty with salt and cayenne pepper, reduce the sauce to a good thickness, then throw in the mince; lay it hot into the shells, and strew some fried bread crumbs over them; put the lobster in the oven for a few minutes, dish on a napkin, and serve as hot as possible. When the dinners exceed four entrees, it will be found neces- sary to prepare a sauce a I'Espagnole, which is a general sauce often referred to. SAUCE A L'ESPAGNOLE 33—Spanish Sauce. Put into a stewpan slices of veal, ham, and a ladleful of consomme or good broth; set it on a slow stove to soak out the juice of the meat, and let it remain on the fire till it is reduced to a glaze of a rich and rather brown colour; then pour in a ladleful of consomme (No. 5) to detach the glaze, and then double that quantity of sauce tournee (No. 6) with trimmings of mushrooms, a bunch of green onions, and parsley: let the sauce boil half an hour, remove all the grease, and pass the sauce through a tammy into a bason, occasionally stirring it with a spoon, to prevent its becoming lumpy.

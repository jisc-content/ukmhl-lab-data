Either roasted or stewed hare answers for potting; pick all the flesh from the bones, and pound it very fine in a marble mor- tar ; season it with cayenne pepper, salt, and fine spice, and at the same time add one-fourth the quantity of clarified butter; let it be thoroughly well mixed, then press it tight into pots, within a quarter of an inch of the top, pour clarified butter over, to preserve it from the air. FARCE FOR POTTING GAME. 359—Partridges, Pheasants, Woodcocks, Sfc. Take an equal quantity of lean veal and fat bacon, chop them together, and season with the mixture (No. 390) ; put this into a large stewpan over a brisk fire, and stir it with a wooden spoon until quite hot, then immediately pound it in a marble mortar; when you have selected the game you intend to preserve, bone them thoroughly, and put a little of the farce in each bird, and form them of their proper shape; then prepare the pots you intend to keep them in, line the bottom and sides with fat bacon, and shake a little more seasoning mixtui'e, as above, round them; place in the birds, either pheasants or partridges, breast down- wards, put some of the farce round and over the birds, press it closely, and then cover them with more fat bacon; tie strong- cartridge paper over the pots, and bake them in a moderately- heated oven; a pot containing three birds will take two hours

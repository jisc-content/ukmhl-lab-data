Take four ounces of flour, mix it with half a pint of cream in a stewpan, then pass the milk which you have already boiled into it; add two ounces of butter, and stir it over the fire till it becomes a thick paste ; remove the stewpan, and immediately mix in ten yolks of eggs, one at a time ; the whites are to be put into a clean bason, and kept in the larder, until it is time to piit the souffle in the oven; then whip them strong, and mix lightly with the souffle : it will take from twenty minutes to half an hour to bake.

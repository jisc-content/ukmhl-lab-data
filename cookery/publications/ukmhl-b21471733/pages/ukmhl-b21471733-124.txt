88 square pieces, which you put into the tureen, and pour the soup upon it; add a little salt and more sugar if necessary. 133—Consomme with Macaroni. Boil a quarter of a pound of Naples macaroni till tender, throw it into cold water, then dry it on a napkin and put it into two quarts of consomme (No. 5); let the soup boil slowly for an hour; serve grated parmasan on a plate for those who choose it. 134—Tureen of Quails. This is to be served as a soup: when you have a large com- pany you must have at least ten or twelve quails, which are boned, and be filled with veal farce; cover the bottom and sides of a stewpan with fat bacon ; form the quails so as to appear whole, place them close together, then cover them with more fat bacon; put in some green onions, parsley, and sweet herbs, tied up, and a blade of mace ; pour in some light broth, and set the stevrpan oyer the fire to stew till you find the quails are tender ; then remove them : take a knuckle of veal, some lean of good flavoured ham, a few onions, and a little sweet marjoram, basil, parsley, mace, and cloves ; pour over this a pint of Madeira, and set the whole over a slow stove to soak : when you find it of a nice colour cover the meat with some good clear broth, and let it boil three hours ; then pass this broth and skim off" all the grease : • put into a stewpan as much flour and butter as will thicken the soup ; stir it over a stove till it becomes a little brown, then pour in the broth you have strained, and put in some trimmings of mushrooms : let this sauce boil for an hour to throw off the fat.

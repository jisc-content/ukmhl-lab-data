307 of boiling water, boil them till tender, then throw them into cold water ; boil some clarified sugar, drain the oranges and put them in, and let them boil up five or six times, then set them by in pans till the next day ; again drain the fruit, boil the syrup, skim it well, and pour it on the oranges ; repeat the same for three or four days; the last time boil up the oranges in the syrup, then place them in jars, pour the syrup on them, and when cold tie them down. 585—Mogul Plums. Gather them just before they are ripe, prick them all over to the core, and put them into cold water; then put them on the fire in a preserving pan with sufficient water to let them swim ; add a handful of salt, and simmer them until they are tender, but not to fly to pieces ; then put them into cold water, and when cold drain and preserve them as greengages (No. 582). 686—Dried Cherries. Stone and pick the cherries, weigh them, and for every pound of fruit take eight ounces of sugar; put a layer of cherries at the bottom of an earthen pan, then a layer of sugar, and so on ; let them remain in this state for three days, then put all together in a preserving pan, boil it up four or five times, let the syrup and cherries cool together; then take out the fruit, drain them and spread them on sieves, and put them into the hot closet, fre- quently removing them on dry sieves.

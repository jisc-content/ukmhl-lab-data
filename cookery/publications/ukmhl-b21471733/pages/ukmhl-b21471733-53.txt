19 COTELETTES DE MOUTON A LA MACEDOINE DE RACINES. 26—Mutton Cutlets, with Macedoine of Roots. Take a neck of mutton, with a thick fillet, and one that has been some time killed; cut it into chops, and trim oflF the chine bone; cover the bottom of a stewpan with slices of fat bacon, upon which lay the cutlets, and then the trimmings, two onions, carrots, and turnips ; pour in boiling water sufl&cient to cover the meat, and cover the whole with white paper; set the stewpan over the fire, and let the cutlets stew until they are quite tender; then lay them on a dish, and press them, by placing another dish over them with a weight upon it: when the cutlets are quite cold, trim them as neatly as possible, and lay them in a saute pan, with some light glaze, in which they are to be warmed ; at dinner time dish them, and serve in the middle a macedoine of roots (No. 203). The second course of the bill of fare (page 22) is arranged for tAvo roasts and one remove; it is not absolutely necessary to remove both roasts, except it is desired. CANETON ROTI. 27—Ducklings. Choose two fat ducklings ; they will take about half an hour roasting; they should be served immediately they are done, and just before you take them from the fire throw over them a little flour and salt, mixed, and baste them with butter; take care the gravy is rich and good, but not black.

113 that is to be done by placing the animal on its back while you cut with a sharp strong knife the shell all round the belly; then with one hand raise the shell, and divide it with your knife from the fleshy part; turn the back shell upright, and have a pail or tub to receive the intestines, which you must detach very care- fully ; then cut away the fins with the flesh attached to them, and divide the fins from the fleshy part at the joint: have ready a stock-pot, with boiling water, into which you dip the fins and head to enable you to remove the scales, which must be thoroughly cleansed off", then with a saw divide the back and belly shell into convenient pieces ; dip them into the water, and by running your knife under the shell it will readily be removed : then put the back of the turtle first into the water, and on it the belly shell; let them boil slowly until it is tender enough to draw out the bones: you must try it frequently that it may not get too soft; you will find that the belly shell will be much sooner done than the back, therefore take that out first, draw out the bones and lay the soft part on dishes; do the same by the back, and put them on separate dishes in the larder : the flesh of the interior of the turtle nmst be well cleansed by washing it in warm water. Cut up a leg of veal and some slices of good flavoured ham, lay the veal and ham at the bottom of a large stewpan, with half-a-dozen onions, a bunch of turtle herbs, such as basil, marjoram, lemon thyme, parsley, mace, and cloves ; some carrot, and two or three leeks; on these lay the fleshy part of the turtle, the fins, and head : put in a ladleful of the broth which the shell was boiled in, cover the stewpan close, and set it over a stove fire to soak for an hour; then pour in the remainder of the broth the shell was boiled in, let it boil, try the fins occasion- ally, and when they are tender take them up and put them on dishes in the larder—they make an excellent entree, which I shall herciifter explain,—let the broth continue to boil until you think the goodness is out of the meat: if you wish to use any of the white meat for entrees, or to put in the soup, take it out be- fore it is too much done; pass the broth through a lawn sieve

51 79—Soufflt of Rice. Take a quarter of a pound of rice, wash it well first in warm water, and afterwards in several waters; then throw it on a large hair sieve to drain, and pick out all the faulty grains ; boil one pint of milk and half a pint of cream, with the peel of a lemon, a lump of sugar, and one third of a teaspoonful of salt; take out the lemon peel which you have infused in the milk, and put in the rice, with two ounces of good fresh butter; set the stewpan on a slow fire, till the rice swells and becomes perfectly tender ; break eight eggs, and mix in the yolks with the rice; next beat the whites, and stir them in gently: put all into the souiSle case, and bake it for three quarters of an hour. ROTIES D' ANCHOIS. 80—Anchovy Toast. Take two dozen anchovies, an ounce of fresh butter, and a little cayenne pepper; first wash the anchovies, and pick out the bones; pound the fish with the butter, and rub it through a hair sieve; cut twenty-four pieces of bread, either round or square, and as thin as possible; fry them very lightly, spread one side of the toast and cover it with another, and so on till all are ready, which will make twelve toasts; beat up an egg yolk and white together with a paste-brush, cover the toast, and dip them lightly into bread crumbs, but not to make them thick and clumsy : they are to be fried in hot lard, just before you dish them, that they may be served as hot as possible.

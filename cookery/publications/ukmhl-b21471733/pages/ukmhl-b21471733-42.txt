SOUPE PRINTANIER. 10—Spring Soup. Having prepared consomme, as directed in No. 5, put two quarts of the broth, perfectly free from grease, into a soup pot, boil some spring carrots sufficiently to enable you to wipe off the skin, trim them of a neat shape; also peel some young turnips quite round, and of an equal size, boil them and put them into a sieve with the carrots, then boil some young heads of celery, some spring onions for a few minutes, to take away the strong taste; put all the roots into the broth, and set the soup pot by the side of the stove to boil slowly, until the vegetable is tender, and the soup impregnated with their flavour; have ready boiled some heads of asparagus, also French beans boiled green and tender; throw them into the soup just before it is served to table; add a small lump of sugar and salt if required. U—Turhot. A turbot kept two or three days is much better eating than a very fresh one. After the turbot is well cleansed, use a kettle to boil it that is sufficiently wide to contain it flat; put a large hand- ful of salt into the kettle, with plenty of cold spring water, lay the fish on a strainer, put it in, and when it is near boiling, skim it well; then set the kettle by the side of the stove to boil slowly for about fifteen or twenty minutes, supposing it to be a fish about eight or ten pounds weight.

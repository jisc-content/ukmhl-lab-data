128 SAUCE A L'lTALIENNE BRUN. 183—Brown Italian Sauce. Peel and chop half a dozen mushrooms very fine, half a shalot, and a little parsley ; put a small knob of butter into a stewpan' and upon it the herbs, with a few drops of lemon juice; fry them lightly, then add three spoonsful of sauce tourn^e (No. 6), and a spoonful of consomme; let the sauce boil by the side of the stove to throw off the grease, skim it perfectly clear—it is not to be too thick—season with a little cayenne pepper and salt, and then remove the sauce into a clean stewpan. SAUCE A L'lTALIENNE BLANCHE 184—White Italian Sauce. Chop only the white part of the mushroom, and leave out the shalot; put the mushrooms, with a little butter and lemon juice, into a stewpan, fry it, and use bechamel (No. 7) instead of sauce tournee; it should just boil up, and then remove the sauce into another stewpan. SAUCE A L'ALLEMANDE. 186—German Sauce. Boil some sauce tournee, and thicken it with the yolks of eggs ; beat up with a little broth, and add a little more seasoning.

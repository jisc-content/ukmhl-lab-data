13 SALSIFIS A LA BECHAMEL. IS—Salsify, with White Sauce. This root is to be boiled until quite tender; take off the ski cut them of an equal length, and serve a bechamel sauce ov them (No 7). ASPERGES. ] 9—Asparagus. Asparagus are eaten in many different ways ; the largest are esteemed best; boil them in salt and water about a quarter of an hour, and serve them with a toast. When the dinner is returned to the kitchen, it is highly neces- sary to put into the larder such of the dishes as may answer for a second dinner; the remainder I particularly advise should be nicely re-dished, and served comfortably to the domestics.

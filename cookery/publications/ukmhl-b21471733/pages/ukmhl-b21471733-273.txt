237 OEUFS EN TIMBALES. 451—Eggs en Timbales. Butter eight dariole moulds, oval or round, then beat up six eggs, with three spoonsful of bechamel sauce (No. 7); season them with pepper and salt, fill the darioles with the eggs, and set them into a stewpan with boiling water, over a slow fire, and let the water boil gently, till the eggs are set; then loosen them, and turn them out on the dish, and serve with a rich gravy. 452—Caramel. Take any quantity of sugar, according to what you have to do of caramel; put as much cold water to the sugar as will dissolve it, then set it over a quick stove ; attend to remove the scum before it boils, which is clarifying the sugar; then boil the sugar as expeditiously as possible: it requires a strong fire, but this must be applied to the bottom of the sugar only, as by too fierce a fire round the sides of the pan it would burn, which would en- tirely spoil the caramel; the sides of the pan should be occasion- ally wiped with a damp cloth or sponge; you must by attention judge of the proper degree of caramel: add a few drops of lemon juice, have ready a basin of cold water, take a little of the sugar in a spoon, and drop it into the water; if it is boiled sufficiently strong the sugar will crack like glass : immediately remove the pan from the fire, and hold it in cold water, to prevent its be- coming too high coloured.

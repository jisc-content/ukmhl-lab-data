152 ROUGET SAUCE A LA GENOESE. 2Ab~Mullets. Mullets are so rich in themselves, that they are more generally preferred simply dressed ; however, for the sake of variety, they may be stewed and served as other fish, with various sauces; they are very excellent dressed thus:—butter a saute pan, lay them on it, and sprinkle them with pepper and salt; cover them with buttered paper, and bake them; make a Genoese sauce (No. 36), pour the liquor which runs from the mullets into the sauce, dish them, and pour the sauce over them. ST. PIERRE. 246—John Dory. Boil it as you would turbot, serve with lobster or Dutch sauce (No. 11) in a sauce tureen. RAIE. 247—Skate. Skate should not be dressed quite fresh, but kept at least two days, and is to be served either boiled, or dipped in egg and bread crumbs and fried.

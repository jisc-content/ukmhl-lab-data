(i6 a lark «pit tlirough it, and fasten it securely on another spit to roast; cover the lamb all over with paper : it will take about an hour and a quarter roasting; then dish it and glaze the larded part; serve with it a cucumber sauce (see No. 209). TURBAN DE LAPEREAU. 102— Turhan of Fillets of Rabbit. Take four young rabbits, detach the fillets, also the inside fillets, the eight large ones should be neatly larded with bacon, and the eight smaller garnished with trufiles, according to your own fancy, or thus—lay them on the table and with a very sharp knife make slanting incisions from one end to the other ; you then take a round cutter, the width of the fillet, and scoop some pieces out of large trufiles, and with a sharp knife slice them as thin as pos- sible ; place into each incision a round piece of truffle and press the flesh close, by this means they will remain. Make a farce of the flesh of the legs of the rabbit, the same as veal (No. 304), then cut a piece of bread for the centre of the dish you are to serve the turban on, cover the bread with slices of fat bacon—it will be the more easily removed when the turban is done if the head is divided into four pieces ; raise the farce equally round the bread on the dish it is to be served on, form it the shape of a turban, then place tha eight large fillets in a slanting form all round the turban equally divided, and between each a small fillet with the trufiles ; press them lightly to make them secure, cover the whole with layers of bacon, and then white paper, and'tie string round the paper; it is then to be baked in an oven not too hot: when you think the farce is sufficiently set remove the bread which is inside (before you take ofi'the bacon) by taking out one quarter at a time, and then remove the outside covering : glaze the fillets, and serve a ragout of cocks' combs, truffles, and mushrooms in the centre.

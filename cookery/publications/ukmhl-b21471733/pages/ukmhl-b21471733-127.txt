91 138—Haunch of Venison. A haunch of buck venison will take from four hours and a half to five hours roasting; I mean to say that it should be roasted for that length of time, as it will make it more tender, and the flavour will be improved : of course the fire and covering of the venison are to be regulated accordingly. I have had great oppor- tunities of judging, and much experience in roasting venison. It should be kept as long as possibly it can with safety, not to be the least tainted. Its keeping may be prolonged by careful attention, but never resort to the ice-house, unless necessity absolutely compels you to do so, for it is quite evident the fine flavour of the venison is considerably destroyed by the cold damp atmosphere of an ice-house. The haunch is to be prepared for roasting by first taking off the skin, but be careful in so doing not to deprive it of any of the fat; put the spit through the haunch carefully, so as not to injure the prime part, then rub the fat all over with butter, and wrap it in paper ; make a firm paste of coarse flour—it will re- quire about six pounds—and cover the fat equally all over with the paste; then more paper, and secure it with strong pack- thread ; you must not be sparing of paper or string, for if the covering should get loose your venison will be spoiled ; put the haunch at a good distance from the fire at first, and increase the heat till it roasts gradually, frequently basting it: just before it is to be dished, take it up, remove the covering, which is to be done with the utmost care, that the fat may not be broken, then throw over it some flour and salt mixed, put a good piece of butter, into the basting ladle, and when it is melted pour it all over the fat; dish and send it to table immediately, with good gravy, and some currant jelly and port wine made hot and served in a boat.

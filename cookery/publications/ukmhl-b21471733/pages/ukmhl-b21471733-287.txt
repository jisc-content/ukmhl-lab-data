251 an hour before the souffl6 is to be served beat the whites of the egg-s, mix them gently with the rest, and bake it in a moderately heated oven. If you wish to make a cake, sprinkle a mould twice over with clarified butter and crumbs of bread ; mix with the preparation some dried cherries and currants, and bake it as you would do a souffle ; when done turn the mould upside down on the dish, and send it up hot: this souffle may also be steamed. 4:11—Omelet Souffle. Break six eggs, put the whites into one pan, and the yolks into another; rasp a little lemon peel or orange flowers, beat the yolks well, add a little sugar and salt, and next beat the whites well, and mix them with the yolks lightly ; then put a lump of butter into an omelet pan on the fire, and when the butter is melted pour the omelet into the pan; and when it is firm enough on one side to hold the liquid part, turn it over on the dish you send to table, and finish it in an oven, or use a portable oven with fire on the top; glaze it, and serve it immediately : it should be carried to the dinner room in the portable oven. 478—Orange Puddings. Peel five oranges very thin, put the peel into boiling water, and let it boil till quite tender; then pound it in a mortar, mix with it a quarter of a pound of clarified butter, a table-spoonful of brandy, a few crumbs of sponge biscuits or bread crumbs, the juice of one orange, five yolks of eggs, and one white; line the baking tin with puff paste, and garnish it with candied orange peel.

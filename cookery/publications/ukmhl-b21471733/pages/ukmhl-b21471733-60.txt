2& thin collops, and put them into a cream sauce, and serve either m a vol au vant, or otherwise; it is also excellent with maitre d'hotel sauce. CRIMPED SALMON. 36—Genoese Sauce. Take some carrot, onions, bay leaf, sprig of thyme, one blade of mace, a few cloves; put all together into a stewpan, with two ounces of butter; set these over a very slow fire to soak for half an hour, then pour in half a pint of Madeira or other white wine; let it boil slowly for some time, then pass the liquor through a sieve, reduce it, and add some good rich sauce tournee; just before you serve it, stir in a piece of cold butter, the juice of half a lemon, and a little cayenne pepper. Boil the salmon in water just enough to cover it, with a blade of mace, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two onions stuck with cloves; when you take up the salmon to dish, drain it well, and pour the sauce over it. If this dish is to be served to a Catholic family, instead of using sauce tournee, use some of the liquor the fish was boiled in, and thicken it with butter and flour. 37—Poulards d la Financiere. Take a fine large poulard, and fill it with farce made of veal (No. 304); bind it all over with slices of fat bacon, put it into a stewpan that will just hold the fowl, with a bay leaf, two onions, and a blade of mace, and any white fat you may have at hand ; fill up the stewpan with boiling water, and give it about an hour to cook. When you dish the foWl, wipe off all the grease from it, and serve with a financiere sauce under it (No. 181).

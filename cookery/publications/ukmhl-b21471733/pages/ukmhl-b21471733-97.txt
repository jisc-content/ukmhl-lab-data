61 trim the leaves, and then Ihie the bottom of a stewpan with slices of fat bacon, on which you place the artichokes, with an onion, a little spice, and two spoonsful of broth, and the juice of a lemon ; cover the stewpan close, and stew them for half an hour; then try them, to feel if they are all tender; if they are done enough, drain the grease from them and dish them, and pour a little Spanish sauce in the centre of each. 97—Mosaic Jelly. Boil a pint of cream, in which you infuse the flavour of orange, lemon, or noyeau, and add sugar sufficient to sweeten it; break tlie yolks of six eggs into a bason, and pass the cream through a sieve; beat the eggs and cream together, and stir it over the fire till it thickens; then remove it, and mix in as much melted isinglass as you think sufficient to make it firm; then pass it through a tammy, divide the cream into two plain moulds, and add a little cochineal, sufficient to colour one part; set these in the ice—if you have flavoured your cream with orange or lemon, you must prepare a jelly of the same; if with noyeau, which is preferable to either, take some clear calf's foot, and flavour it with white noyeau ; take a mould that you intend to shape your jelly in, and then cut the creams and jelly you have prepared into square lumps; intermix a row at the bottom of your mould, placing some square and some corner ways; put the mould in ice, and pour in a little jelly; it should not be the least warm ; when it is set, proceed in the same way, until the mould is filled up; surround it in ice, and when you wish to serve the jelly, dip the mould in warm water, and turn it on the dish; wipe' the mould with a cloth, and then remove it carefully.

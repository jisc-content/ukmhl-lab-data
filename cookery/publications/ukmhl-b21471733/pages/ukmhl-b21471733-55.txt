21 whole, as they will bear the fire better than any other apple I know of; at the same time there are many other small apples which, with care, will answer the same purpose. Take a dozen and a half of small apples, push out the core with a vegetable cutter, and then peel them as round as possible, and all of the same size; as they are peeled, throw them into a bason of cold water, with the juice of a lemon, then put the apples into a preserving pan, with a thin syrup, and let them boil; keep turning them, and watch them closely, that they do not burst: when you find the apples are tender, lay them on a hair sieve to drain, reduce the syrup to a jelly, and again put the apples in; give them a boil up, and put them away in the jelly. Make a marmalade with some more apples, keep it white and clear, and sufiiciently thick to bear the apples you have stewed; dish some of the marmalade, which you level with your knife ; lay the apples round, and then fill up the middle with marmalade, and another layer of apples upon that. In the cavity of each apple, put a little red apple jelly, and garnish the whole accord- ing to your own taste. PAIN A LA DUCHESSE. 31â€”Duchess Bread. Make the royal paste (No. 465), which you drop on a paste- board in round balls of an equal size, and then roll them lightly about the length of a finger.

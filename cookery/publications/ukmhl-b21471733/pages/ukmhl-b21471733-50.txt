IG a braising pan, with the lid fitting close, and bordered so as to hold hot ashes or charcoal on it, that the contents may stew without the least evaporation. This mode of cookery excellently preserves the flavour of the viands used. It is necessary to observe, that every thing which is braised must be done thoroughly, and is likewise to be seasoned with vegetable, sweet herbs, and spice. To braise in perfection requires the greatest nicety, and so much care and constant attention, that no cook can possibly succeed who is not earnest in these matters. A rump of beef braised till it is stringy and ragged, and yet not tender, can only disappoint the company, and, consequently, is perfect waste : the same applies to a fri- condeau, and, indeed, every entree that is not well dressed. LONGE DE VEAU A LA BECHAMEL. 22â€”Loin of Veal, with Bechamel Sauce. Let the loin of veal you choose be fat and Avhite; it should be carefully put on the spit, so as not to injure the fillet. I consider the cradle spit decidedly the best for this joint; it is to be covered with paper, which should be rubbed over with butter; a loin of veal will take from two hours to two hours and a half, roasting according to the size; just before you serv^e this joint, take out a square piece from the thick end, by turning back the skin ; let this be cut as thin as possible ; have ready on the stove a little bechamel (No. 7) nicely seasoned, and throw the collops in; give it a turn or two over the stove quickly, and then put it into the place it was taken from; turn over the skin again, and serve bechamel sauce round the veal: do not omit putting a toast under the kidney. We shall now proceed with the four entrees, which makes up the first course.

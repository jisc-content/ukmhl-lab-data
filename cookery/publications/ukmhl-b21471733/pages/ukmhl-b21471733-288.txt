252 A79—Friture Souffics. Put a piece of butter, about two ounces, into a stewpan, a little grated lemon peel, an ounce of sugar, a pinch of salt, and half a pint of water, and let all boil up together; then take a large spoonful of flour, sufficient to form a thick paste, stir it over the fire with a wooden spoon till the paste is quite firm, remove the stewpan from the fire, and stir in while it is hot five eggs, one at a time, and work it till it becomes quite smooth and nearly cold : when you wish to fry them, make some clean lard moderately hot in a large stewpan, and with a tea-spoon take up the paste, about the size of a walnut, dropping it into the lard, and continue to do so till the paste is all used; fry over a slow fire, and con- stantly keep moving the stewpan; when the fritures are well raised, and a good colour, serve hot on a napkin, with fine sugar over them : if well made, they will be light and delicate eating. 480—Apple Fritures. Take out the cores of half a dozen of large apples, peel them, and cut them into rings about a quarter of an inch thick; put them on a dish, with some grated lemon peel, and a little brandy over them ; then dip them in batter made with half a pound of flour, a spoonful of sweet oil, a little salt and water, sufficient to make it of a consistence to hang to the apples ; whip the whites of two eggs and stir into it, dip each piece of apple into the bat- ter, and immediately into the hot lard ; fry them of a nice colour, and sift some powdered sugar over both sides of the friture, and before you send to table hold a hot salamander over them ; dish them on a napkin.

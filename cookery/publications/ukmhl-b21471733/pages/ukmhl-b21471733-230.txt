194 SAUTE DE PEDRIX AU SUPREME. 348—Saute of Partridges. You require six partridges for this entree ; they must be young birds, and kept for some time, that they may have their full fla- vour, and be more tender ; turn back the skin from off the breast, take out the fillets, and detach the small fillet from the large one; cut out the sinew of the small fillet, flatten the large ones with a small beater, dipped in water; the small ones may be garnished with truffles, trim them neatly, put them into a saute pan, with clarified butter, and lay the small fillets upon them; sprinkle them with a little salt, and cover them with buttered paper, and send them to the larder till dinner time: put the remnants of the birds into a stewpan, with some slices of veal, ham, and a few spoonsful of consomme (No. 5); cover the stewpan, and set it on a slow fire for half an hour, then add more consomme, some trimmings of mushrooms, and a bunch of green onions ; boil it half an hour longer, then strain it through a lawn sieve, skim off the grease, pour the broth into another stewpan, and reduce it to glaze: when you saute the fillets, drain the butter from them; then take a little bechamel (No. 7) and some of the glaze, stir it over the fire until it is quite hot, season it with a little cayenne pepper and salt; if the fillets are not garnished with truffles, dip each one as you dish it in the sauce, and pour the remainder in the dish; if you have used truffles for garnish, put some whole ones in the sauce, and serve them in the centre of the fillets. 349—Cutlets of Partridge en Epigram.

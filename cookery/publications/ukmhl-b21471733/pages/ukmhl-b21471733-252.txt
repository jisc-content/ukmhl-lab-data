216 green onions, and sweet lierbs, put with this a ladleful of broth; cover the stewpan and set it on a slow fire; when the juice is reduced to a thick glaze fill up the stewpan with more broth, and let it boil for two hours; season with salt and pepper; strain it through a silk sieve, and then reduce it to half glaze to fill up the pies when you take them out of the oven. 397—Blanc for cooking Vegetables. Mince half a pound of beef or veal suet and the same quantity of fat bacon, a quarter of a pound of butter, two slices of lemon, a little salt, and three pints of spring water, and let this stew for half an hour, then pass it through a hair sieve : it is to be used to cook cardoons, celery, artichokes, and such roots as are required to be dressed white; besides which, it gives a mel- lowness, and improves their flavour.

Cut them in lengths of about three inches, and pick the stringy part from the heart and the prickles from the leaves; blanch them in boiling water for fifteen minutes, then throw them into cold water ; when they are cold wipe them very clean in a cloth, and put them into a stewpan with as much of the blanc (No. 379) as will cover them ; set the stewpan over a slow fire: when they are tender send them to table with a sauce a I'espagnole (No. 33), or bechamel (No. 7).

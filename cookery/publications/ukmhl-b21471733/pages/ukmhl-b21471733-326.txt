290 with a spoon lay the biscuits on paper about three inches long, sift powdered sugar over them, and bake them of a nice colour. This mixture may be made into many different sorts of cakes; drop them round, and strew carraway seeds over them, or bake them in small moulds, which should be buttered with clarified butter. It will be found a far more ready way to drop all these sorts of cakes, by taking a sheet of strong white paper, rolled like a funnel, leaving an opening at the small end, according to the biscuit you intend making. 541—Biscuits in Cases. Make one or two dozen of small paper cases, fill them with the above mixture, throw coarse broken sugar over them and bake them immediately. 642—Almond Hearts. Blanch half a pound of sweet almonds, and pound them with one or two whole eggs till the almonds are perfectly smooth; add three quarters of a pound of powdered sugar, and mix it well in the mortar, with the raspings of two lemons ; then take out the paste, put it into a large basin, take twelve eggs, break in two or three yolks at a time, beating it well each time; when you have mixed in all the yolks of eggs, and have beat the paste at least half an hour, then whip the twelve whites very strong; take three quarters of a pound of flour, sift it into the paste, and mix it smooth; then stir in the whites as lightly as possible, butter your heart tins, and bake them in a moderately hot oven ; if baked in too hot an oven they will not keep their shape.

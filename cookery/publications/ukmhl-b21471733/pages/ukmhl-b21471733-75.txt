39 56—Two Poulards, aux Nouilli. Take two fine poulards, trussed for boiling, cover the breasts with slices of fat bacon, put them into a stewpan large enough, and cook them in poele (No. 9). If they are of a large size, they will take an hour and a quarter boiling ; if they are of a common size, one hour will do; take them up, wipe them free from grease, and serve a bechamel sauce, with nouilli paste (No. 470)-. 57—Small Timhales, with Salpicon. Butter ten or twelve dariole moulds, spread some trimmings of puff paste on the dresser, cut it with a round cutter large enough to fill the mould; then take a piece of paste, make it the same size as the dariole shape, put the round piece of paste over it, and by that means you can press it into the mould, so that it is of an equal thickness all round ; cut off the paste that is above the rim, fill the mould with trimmings of paste, and put on a Mse cover; and when baked empty all the inside, cut some puff paste with a round cutter, the size of the top of the timballe, put them on a baking sheet, brush them over with yolk of egg, and bake them. These timbales are to be filled either with a salpicon, or collops offish, poultry, or game. N. B, Salpicon is composed of several sorts of meat, cut into dice, such as sweetbreads, livers, ham, tongue, truflfles, mush- rooms, &c. put into a rich tournee or bechamel. Many more things may be added to this ragout.

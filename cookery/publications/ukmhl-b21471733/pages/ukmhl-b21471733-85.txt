49 cut, and some asparagus points boiled quite green; have ready a very clear rich Espagnole sauce (No. 33), and a few^ minutes before you serve the chickens throw these roots into the boiling sauce; let them boil up, skim the sauce, add a little sugar and salt. This sauce must be extremely delicate, to preserve the flavour of the roots, and to accord with the fine flavour of the chicken. PALAIS DE BOUEF AU GRATIN. 75—Beef Palates au Gratin. Take six beef palates, rub them over with a little salt, and if they can remain thus for twelve or twenty-four hours, the better ; then boil them in water, with some white fat, slices of lemon without the rind, and a little mace, onions, &c.; stew them till they are sufiiciently done that you can take off the skin : when they are thoroughly cleansed from the skin, cut them in two, trim each of the same length and breadth, then spread some veal farce (No. 304), and roll them so that the farce appears at each end; then put some of the farce on the middle of the dish, and place the palates on the farce all round the dish; cover the whole with layers of fat bacon, put them into the oven to do sufficiently, but not to get too brown; drain oflF all the fat, take away the layer of bacon, clean the dish, and serve over the whole a clear Espagnole sauce (see No. 33).

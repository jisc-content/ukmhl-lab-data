50 CERVELLES DE VEAU A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. 77—Calf's Brains, the Steward's way. Four or six halves will be sufficient for a dish; throw the brains into cold water, to soak out the blood, then strip them of the skin, and blanch them in boiling water with a little salt and vinegar for ten minutes; take them upon a sieve to drain, pre- pare a stewpan with vegetable spice, and a bunch of sweet .herbs, over which lay slices of fat bacon, and also round the stewpan, upon which lay the brains; pour in a spoonful of broth, cover the whole with paper, cut to fit the stewpan, set them over the fire for an hour, then fry nicely as many pieces of bread, cut in the shape of a cock's comb, as you have brains : place one between each half of the brains, and serve with a maitre d'hotel sauce (No. 210), over the brains. SAUTE D'AGNEAU DE POIS VERTE. 78—Saute of Lamb and green Peas. It will require two necks of house lamb to make a handsome dish. Cut the cutle(,s separately, the bones of an equal length, flatten them with the cutlet beater, and trim each cutlet neatly; dip them in clarified butter, put them on a saute pan, and fry them lightly; then place the cutlets on a napkin to dry away the grease, and dip each cutlet into very light glaze as you dish them; have some green peas boiled, put them immediately into a stewpan, with a small piece of butter and a little powdered sugar; toss them up, and serve the peas in the centre of the cutlets: they should have no other sauce.

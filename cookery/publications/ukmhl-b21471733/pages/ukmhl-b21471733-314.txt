278 A table tlms arranged, and by introducing a plateau and other ornaments down the middle of the table, also at the top and bottom of the table large cakes, such as brioche and baba, pre- sents an agreeable cold supper, and infinitely less expensive than a table crowded with jellies, pastries, creams, salads, &c. things which few people ever partake of: however, as such suppers may be desired, I have prepared a Bill of Fare for those persons whose choice may lead that way. Bill or Fare for a Ball Supper. Jelly. Pastry. Cold tongue. Noyeau cream. Aspic of lobster. Cake. Cold chicken bechamel. White vermicelli soup. Cold roast chicken. Cake. Aspic of fowl. Strawberry cream. Cold ham. Pastry. Jelly. Jelly. Pastry. Cold ham. Apricot cream. Aspic of fowl. Cake. Cold roast chicken. Soupe a la reine. Cold chicken bechamel. Cake. Aspic of fish. Venille cream. Cold tongue. Pastry. Jelly. A table laid out in this style presents an elegant supper, and by replenishing the soups will serve from fifty to one hundred persons. When soups are served for suppers, there should also be hot vegetables interspersed at diff-erent parts of the table, and replenished as often as the dishes are emptied. The usual orna- ments to be introduced down the centre of the table, with cold pies, ornamental pastries, and baskets of fruit should fill up the vacancies.

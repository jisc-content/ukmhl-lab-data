Pare and wash a dozen or eighteen Jerusalem artichokes, slice them, and put into a stevrpan two ounces of butter, over which lay the artichokes, with half a pound of lean ham; set them over a slow stove to soak for an hour, frequently shaking the stewpan ; add to this about three pints of good light consomme (No. 5), and let the whole boil for half an hour; skim off all the fat: soak the crumb of two French rolls in milk, and when thoroughly soaked squeeze out all the milk and boil the crumb in the soup ; then pass it through a tammy, put it into a clean soup pot, stir it over the fire till it boils, skim the soup, and it is fit to serve.

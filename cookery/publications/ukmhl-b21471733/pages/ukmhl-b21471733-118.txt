82 turnips, by boiling them separately till tender in salt and water, with a little white veal fat or butter, or slices of bacon; take a round vegetable scoop, cut as many pieces as you can, then with your knife cut them in round fillets; lay a row of carrots one over the other round the mould, then a row of turnips cut the same way, again carrots, and so on, till you arrive three parts up the mould; cut some beef palates that have been dressed, as in No. 9, with round pieces; soak them in glaze, and put them at the bottom of the mould, one over the other; take some spinach that has been boiled very green, chop it fine, put the spinach into a stewpan with a piece of butter, and stir it over the fire until it is quite hot; season it well, mix in four yolks of eggs, fill up the mould, and press it close down; set the mould in boiling for half an hour, then turn it over on the dish, remove the mould and paper, and with a paste-brush drop some thin glaze over the vegetable : when the roots are young, this is by far the best way to make a chartreuse: when dished, pour round an Espagnole sauce (No. 33). 127â€”Macedoine Jelly. Strawberries, raspberries, grapes, currants, and cherries, are the only fruit that can be used raAv for a macedoine ; but it is to be observed, they should be perfectly ripe; peaches, apricots, apples, and pines, require to be boiled in syrup before they are put into the jelly: in the first place, have a good clear jelly prepared, rather sweet for a macedoine, because raw fruit takes off the sweetness ; put a little jelly into a mould, which you set on the ice, then array the fruit variously, according as your fancy suggests ; then pour in some more jelly; when that is firm, lay more fruit and jelly, and continue to do so till you have filled the mould to the top ; keep the jelly in the. ice till dinner timej

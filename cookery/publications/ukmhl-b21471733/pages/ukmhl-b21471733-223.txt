187 the fillets; trim them very neatly, have ready some clarified but- ter into which dip the fillets, and then lay them on a saute pan ; cover them with buttered paper; at dinner time saute them very lip-htly, drain the butter from them, and put two spoonsful of bechamel in the pan; cover each fillet with the sauce, and lay them neatly round the dish, and a ragout k la royale m the cen- tre; this ragout must be particularly white, composed of cocks combs, kidneys, mushrooms, small quenelles, and truffles. 230—Wings of Chicken, d la Dauphine. This dish should only be attempted when you have a very large dinner, as all the fillets must be cut from the same side of the chicken, with the pinion attached, consequently you will require eight; but where the dinner consists of many entries, you can introduce the remaining fillets in another shape ; lard the fillets with fine bacon, and put them into the oven on a well-buttered saute pan, in order to give them a good shape; when they have acquired a firmness, prepare a stewpan with a bed of vegetables (see fricandeau, No. 40) slices of fat bacon, and a little light broth; lay the fillets on this, cover the stewpan close, set it over a fire, with lighted charcoal on the top, glaze the fillets, lightly dish them on a puree of endive, asparagus peas, or any sauce that may best correspond with your other dishes. 331—Fricassee de Poulet, d la St. Florentine. Prepare a fricassee as directed (No. 94), add to the sauce small quenelles, truffles, and eggs, which is the only diflierence.

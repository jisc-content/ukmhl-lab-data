67 COMPOTE DE CAILLES. 103—Compote of Quails. It will require six quails for this entree : truss them as you would chickens for boiling; place them into a stewpan suffi- ciently large to hold them, put in a piece of butter, a small bunch of green onions, a little parsley, a sprig of marjorum, a few cloves, and a leaf of mace ; set the stewpan over the stove for ten minutes, throw in a tablespoonful of flour, and shake it about in the stewpan until mixed ; then take as much good broth as will goyer the birds, and keep moving the stewpan over the stove till the sauce boils; then remove it to the corner, and throtv in some parings of mushrooms and a glass of madeira wine : try the birds occasionally, and when you find them tender put them, into a clean stewpan, and should the sauce not be thick enough reduce it a little more ; skim off all the grease, and pass it through a tammy to the quails : have ready some button mushrooms, some small quenelles and truffles, throw them in and give the whole a boil up : dish the quails and serve the sauce over them ; you may put- between each quail a piece of bread cut and fried for garnish, or a small pudding of farce in the shape of quails garnished with truffles. 104—JDariole Patties, puree a la Heine. Take eight or ten dariole moulds and line them with paste, fill them with trimmings of paste, cut tops of the same paste, rub them over with the yolk of eggs, bake them, and then take out the inside ; take all the white meat from two roasted fowls, pound it in a mortar until you can pass it through a fine hair sieve ;.

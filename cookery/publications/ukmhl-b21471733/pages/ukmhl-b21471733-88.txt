52 —Lemon Jelly. The process in making lemon jelly is precisely the same as orange (No. 71); but where you would use eighteen oranges, twelve lemons would he sufficient for the same quantity of jelly ; be careful that you do not use a musty one, which would spoil the jelly. 82—Croques en Bouche. Take some puff paste, roll it out as thin and even as possible, cover a square baking sheet with the paste, and brush it over with white of eggs, and sprinkle it with coarse lump sugar; cut it either long or round, and bake it quickly : it will eat very crisp and delicate. Dish the pastry on a napkin. VOL-AU-VENT OF FRUIT (See No. 109.) 83—Duchess Cake, Gateau a la Duchess. Prepare a sponge cake mixture (No. 128), and bake it in a plain mould—the cake would be the better for being made two or three days before—then trim the cake round the sides, and cut it into slices about half an inch thick; take a piece out of the centre, leaving the rim an inch thick, spread the pieces over with a mar- malade of apple mixed with apricot, then place one upon the other, and smooth it round the sides and top; garnish it tastefully, and fill the centre with a thick custard (No. 486).

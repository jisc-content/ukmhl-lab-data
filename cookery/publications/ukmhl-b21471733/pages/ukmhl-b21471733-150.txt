into separate basins; you may boil the meat again with some common broth in case you should require it to thin your soup. You are now to take a clean stewpan, large enough to hold the quantity of soup, put into it a lump of fresh butter and as much flour as it will absorb ; set it over the fire, stir it continually until it begins to turn brown ; by no means suffer it to get a burnt taste, that would totally destroy your soup ; moisten this by de- grees with the broth of the turtle, and stir it till it boils ; then draw it to the side of the stove : put into the sauce the parings of mushrooms, which should be first passed with butter and lemon juice over the fire to keep them white ; put in a bunch of fresh herbs, with green onions and parsley, and spice; take care that it is not too predominant of either of these things, it is easy to add more of their flavour when you finish your soup if it is re- quired : let this sauce boil for an hour, skim it thoroughly, and pass it through a tammy into a clean soup pot; by this time the turtle will be sufficiently cold, cut it in convenient square pieces, put them into the sauce, and let all boil together. As it is the practice to put force meat balls and egg balls into the turtle, I shall give directions for making each separately. When the turtle has boiled up with the meat in it, carefully remove all the scum that rises and put it away in basins : it is to be observed, the turtle is better to be made a day before it is served, the flavour of the different ingredients are more united : when you serve the turtle soup, for every four quarts of turtle add a pint of Madeira wine, which should be first boiled ; and if the turtle should re- <juire more seasoning of spice or herbs, boil either that may be required in a little consomme, and strain it to the soup ; the last thing, before you put the soup in the tureen, squeeze in some lemon juice, and add cayenne pepper and salt if required. Ob- serve, do not put the wine and lemon juice to the turtle if you wish to keep it any time; only introduce it as you serve the turtle. The fins of turtle make an excellent entree served either with matelotte or cardinal sauce.

]68 to halt glaze, make a sauce as for attelets (No. 201) with a por tion of this glaze, and cover the beef all over with the sauce, and then with bread crumbs : set the beef in the oven to gratin, and add to the remainder of the glaze two or three spoonsful of sauce tournee (No. 6), and two glasses of white wine; boil and skim the sauce : if the beef does not get sufficiently brown in the oven use the salamander, and when dished pour the sauce round : the sauce should be highly seasoned. 289—Fricassee of Beef Palates. Braise six or eight beef palates, as directed No. 75, cut them the size of half-a-crown piece, throw them into a bechamel sauce (No. 7); they may be served in a casserole of rice, a timbale, or vol-au-vent: the palates must be perfectly tender before they'are put into the sauce, and the sauce rather thick; add a little parsley boiled : they are excellent when well dressed. 290~Blanquette of Beef Palates and Cucumbers.

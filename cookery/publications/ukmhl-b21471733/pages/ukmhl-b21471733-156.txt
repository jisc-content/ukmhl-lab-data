120 167—Soupe a la Fauhonne. Cut in quarters the hearts of half a dozen cabbage-lettuce and a handful of sorrel, wash them perfectly clean, then put them into a stewpan, with two ounces of butter, a little salt and sugar, and set the stewpan on a slow stove for a quarter of an hour; put the vegetable thus prepared into a puree of peas or carrots, let the soup boil, and skim off all the fat as it rises : you may put into the soup, as it boils, a small bunch of chervil, which gives it a pleasant taste, but take it out before you serve the soup. PUREE DE POIS VERTE. 168—Puree of Green Peas, Boil three pints of light-coloured consomme (No. 5), with green onions, parsley, and mint, tied up in a bunch, to flavour the broth; take three pints of large green peas, fresh gathered, boil them in plenty of water with a little salt in it; as soon as they are tender immediately pound them well, and rub them through a tammy with the broth you have seasoned : at dinner time set the soup over the fire, constantly stirring it till it comes to boil, skim it well, and then remove the soup, and keep it hot without boil- ing ; add a little sugar and salt, if requisite: send up on a plate square slices of bread nicely fried. 169—Soupe a la bonne femme. Take a handful of sorrel, draw out the stalk, and place each.

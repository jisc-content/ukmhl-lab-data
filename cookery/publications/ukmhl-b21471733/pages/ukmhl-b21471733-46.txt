12 into quarters, peel them, put them into a stewpan, with about two ounces of butter, the peel of a lemon, a little cinnamon, and half a pound of pounded sugar; stew them at first over a slow stove, then with a wooden spoon keep stirring them over a quick fire, till reduced to a firm consistence ; it will improve the char- lotte to add half a pound pot of apricot marmalade to the apple: you then prepare a plain mould with bread dipped in clarified butter; for the bottom cut the crumb with a plain round cutler, dip each piece into the butter, and lay them one over the other, all round the bottom of the mould: cut thin slices of bread, the height of the mould, dip them also into the butter, and place them round the side of the mould, one over the other, so that the apple may not pass through; put in the marmalade of apples, and bake it in an oven that is pretty hot; give it a good colour, turn it on the dish, and serve the charlotte quite hot and crisp. 17—Marivgnes, d la Creme. The maringues' shells (No. 458) ; should at all times be kept in readiness, to fill them, prepare a cream thus :—^Take half a pint of double cream, put it into a bason, and whip it till it becomes quite light and thick, adding at the same time half a glass of sherry, and a spoonful of brandy, with the zest of lemon, by rubbing the rind on a lump of sugar, and scraped into the cream ; or the cream may be flavoured with noyeau or marashino. The maringues should not be filled till the moment they are to be served; either may be dished on a napkin, neatly folded, or in a basket of sugar.

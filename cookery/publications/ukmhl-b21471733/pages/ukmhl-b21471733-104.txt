OS then reduce some good bechamel, which should be well flavoured with mushrooms, mix the chicken with the sauce, season it before you fill the patties : do not suffer this puree to boil, which would totally spoil it. QUENELLES D'HOMARD AU SUPREME. i 105â€”Quenelles of Lobster au Supreme. Take the flesh from two small or one large lobster, some spawn of lobster, and the fillets of one whiting, which should be well pounded together for a considerable time, and then passed through a sieve; put into a stewpan the bones of the whiting and whatever soft part you can pick out of the lobster, a few green onions, a little marjorum, mace and cloves, and a ladle- ful of light broth ; set them on the fire for half an hour, then pass the broth into a basin, soak some crumbs of French roll in cold milk, and afterwards squeeze them in a cloth as dry as possible, put them into a stewpan with a little of the fish broth you have strained, and rub them over the stove till it becomes dry and firm; turn it out on a plate, and when cold make up a ball the same size as your fish, and proceed pounding them together; add some fresh butter, about one-fourth of the bulk of that which you are pounding, mix in six yolks of eggs, a little cayenne pepper and salt, and rub the whole through a sieve; beat the whites of four eggs very firm and mix with it; butter eight dariole moulds, at the bottom of which put a piece of paper, fill the mould and let them steam for twenty minutes ; reduce the broth which is left from the bones with two spoonsful of sauce tournee (No. 6) and a teaspoonful of elder vinegar ; season it, and just before you serve stir into the sauce a piece of good fresh butter.

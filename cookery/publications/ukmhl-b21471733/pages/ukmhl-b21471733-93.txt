57 rots, turnips, large onions, and stuffed cucumbers; over which you serve a rich Sjianish sauce (No. 33), well seasoned. CROQUETTES DE PALAIS DE BOEUF. 90—Croquettes of Beef Palates. The trimmings of palates which you may have used for other dishes, serve for croquets; mince them fine, and then reduce some bechamel (No. 7) to a pretty thick consistence; throw in the mince, give it a boil, and add a little more seasoning; spread it on a dish, and when cold make them up in round balls, or shape them long; dip them into eggs, and then roll them in bread crumbs : they are to be egged and crumbed twice over, in conse- quence of their being very apt to burst in frying. PETIT PATES AU NATUREL. 91—Patties of Force Meat. These patties are excellent eating when well made; they must not be baked till the time of dinner. Take some puff paste, roll It, and cut out twelve round pieces with a plain cutter; have some veal farce (No. 304) ready, rather highly seasoned, which you roll up ,n small balls; place one in the centre of each piece of paste, then cut another of the same size, and lay lightly over the farce, but do not press down the sides; rub the tops over with yolk of eggs m.xed with a little water, bake them of a nice colour, and serve them as hot as possible.

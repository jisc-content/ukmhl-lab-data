70 out on a dish to cool: when it is cold and firm make them up into small balls, just a mouthful, dip them in eggs beaten up, be particular that they are covered all over with egg; immediately roll them in bread crumbs, and again shape the croquette ; have ready at dinner time some clean lard, made hot, and fry them half-a-dozen at a time ; if you put more into the lard at one time they would probably burst, as they are to be made very delicate. N.B. I am sorry to observe, that, from the slovenly and care- less way in which croquettes are made in some kitchens there exists a prejudice against the entree, and consequently they are often rejected when really good eating. If a croquet is dry, greasy, the outside thick and tough, they are certainly not eatable : if, on the contrary, they are well made, they are delicious : they should retain the flavour of whatever the croquette is composed of, the outsides should be thin and crisp, of a nice colour, free from grease, and when broken full of sauce. 108—Clear Strawberry Jelly.

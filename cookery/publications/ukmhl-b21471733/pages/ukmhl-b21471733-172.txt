Put into a stewpan some burnet, chervil, tarragon, parsley, and a little shalot, with two spoonsful of good consomme, and set it on a stove to reduce it to glaze ; then add some sauce tournee, and pass the sauce through a tammy : add cayenne, salt, and a tea spoonful of lemon juice. 201—White Ravigotte. The same as last—except that you use bechamel instead of the brown sauce, and at the last moment work in a small piece of but- ter, a little cayenne pepper, and salt. 208'—Sauce Supreme. Cut a fowl into pieces, a quarter of a pound of the lean part of a fine-flavoured ham, a shalot, and a small faggot of parsley and green onions: set it over a stove with a little good broth to soak till it becomes a glaze at the bottom of the stewpan; then add about a pint of sauce tournee, boil it for half an hour, skim off the fat, and then pass it through a tammy. If for white sauce then reduce it with some good cream.

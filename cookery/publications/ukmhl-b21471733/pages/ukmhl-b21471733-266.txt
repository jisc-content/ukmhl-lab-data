230 SALPICON CRU. 434—Raw Salpicon. Cut the breast of a fowl into small square dices : wash half a dozen of anchovies and one or two Dutch herrings; cut them the same as the fowl, peel a raw apple and some cooked beet- root ; cut them also in the same way, put all together into a basin, season with pepper, salt, and cayenne; mix one glass of sweet oil with the same quantity of vinegar, and pour over the whole : put the salpicon in the middle of the dish, and garnish it with sliced gherkins or French olives. 435—Fowl Sandwiches au supreme. Fillet as many fowls as you think you will require for the party; dip each fillet in clarified butter, arrange them in a saute pan, and about an hour before you want to make your sand- wiches fry the fillets, take them out of the butter, and let them get cold: sandwiches should not be cut long before they are to be eaten. Take some bechamel, made of the remnants of the fowls, reduce the sauce well; season it with salt and a little cayenne, and set the sauce to cool: when you wish to make the sand- wiches, cut the fillets into thin slices, lay them one upon another between two plates ; then cut thin slices of bread, lay them side by side, and spread over them a little of the bechamel sauce; over this lay the slices of fowl, cut the same number of slices of bread, and spread them also with the bechamel sauce; sprinkle a little salt between, and turn over the last slices of bread, press them lightly together : you may either cut the sandwich round.

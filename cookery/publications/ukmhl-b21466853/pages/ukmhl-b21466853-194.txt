IGO SAUCES. LEMON SAUCE.—No. II. Make a nice butter sauce ; take the yellow and •white inner rhind from a small lemon ; slice the lemon, and cut each slice in eight pieces, and stir it amongst the sauce after you have taken it off the fire. MADE BUTTER, OR BUTTER SAUCE. Take a dessert-spoonful of either corn or common flour; bruise it gradually, as you do starch, with a break- fast cup of milk; cut up two ounces of fresh butter, and put all into a small clean saucepan, shaking the pan over the fire without stopping, until it comes through the boil. You will find this if you do it right, a much better way than stirring it with a spoon This sauce is the founda- tion for a great many sauces. EGG SAUCE—No. I. Boil two eggs hard, mince the yolks very fine, cut out one of the whites in stripes with a notched cutter, and mince the other with the yolk, stirred into butter sauce. EGG SAUCE—No. II. Melted bulter sauce poured over the beat yolks of two eggs. CAPER SAUCE. If for boiled mutton, make butter sauce with part of the gravy that has boiled the mutton, instead of mUk ; add cream, and a table-spoonful capers chopped or whole, as you please; a few chopped green gherkins, or pickled cucumbers do very weU. Very young pease do beautifully, preserved in vinegar, and used exactly as capers.

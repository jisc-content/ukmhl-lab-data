PAETRIDGES The same; as also all game birds and wild fowl. Examine Plate YIII., where a pheasant and partridge are dressed, after being cooked, for the table; the head, neck, and wings are cut off without stripping them of their feathers, which are fastened on with skewers, when to be served, as will be seen. CHICKENS AND PIGEONS. Chickens and pigeons are trussed either for roasting or boiling as fowls. FISH. A cod's head and shoulders are, after cleaning and skinning it, stuffed and trussed for boiling, by binding it with broad tape. Small fish are skinned, boned, and rolled, and skewered tightly ; or when skinned, the tail is pushed through the eye. JOINTS Are prepared by cracking the bones in several places, where they might be annoying to the carver otherwise.

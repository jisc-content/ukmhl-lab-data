POULTRY AND GAJIE. 120 ROAST HARE. For trussing, see Directions for Trussing. Stuff it with a quarter pound of beef suet, the same of bread-crumbs, a little parsley, and sweet herbs, a little nutmeg grated, and lemon rhind, "with pepper and salt; boil and grate the liver, add two eggs ; if it wants moistening, take milk. It must be well basted, and will take an hour; it is a good plan to boil it one half hour, and roast it another half; or, do it in a deep pie-dish; put milk in the dish, with a good piece of butter, a blade of mace, sweet herbs, pepper, and salt; bake it in the oven, basting very fvec[uently with the gravy in the dish. Dish the hare with a potato border round it; strain the gravy, thicken it, and pour over; serve melted red currant jelly in a sauce-boat. DRESSED PIGEONS.—An Expensive French Dish. Take the livers, with some fat and lean, of bacon, mush- rooms, trufB.es, parsley, and sweet herbs, with pepper, salt, and mace ; beat these with the yolks of two raw eggs, and put this mixture into the bellies; wrap the pigeons in paper that has been spread over with lard, and roast them. Make a nice relishing gravy with any bones or trimmings you have, pour it over the pigeons, and garnish with egg and ham patties. PIGEONS IN WHITE SAUCE.—For a Side Dish. Truss fom- pigeons as fowls are trussed for boiling, stew them for half an hour, dish them neatly, and pour over them a rich white parsley and butter sauce; garnish with a few fried oysters, and a little green parsley.

IS7 SAUCES. There is an expression in common use, to the effect that, " soups and sauces must taste of everything and yet taste of nothing." Tliis seems ridiculous to a certain ex- tent ; for instance, oyster soup and sauce must have the predominating flavour of the oyster, from which they each take their name. The same can be said of celery, onion, and mint sauce; indeed, you can always tell what soup or sauce you are partaking of from its own peculiar predom- inating flavour. There is scarcely, at the same time, a more particular branch in cookery, and one that is so much neglected as the making up of nice relishing sauces. The Savoury sauces made by Lazenby, Cross and Blackwell, Harvey, &c., may all be used at discretion, by those who choose, in addition for extra seasonings. BEOWN GEAVY SAUCE. Hot sauces are either brown or white. For brown sauce, put a piece of butter or dripping into the saucepan, melt it a,nd dust with flour. When quite brown, but not burnt, put in the meat, bones, or trimmings of whatever kind you mean to use for the purpose; mince a few onions and add, if the flavour be agreeable; add, also, seasoning to taste, and boiling water; cover and let simmer for a long time to draw out the goodness. When the sauce is wanted, it is strained and thickened, if necessary (brown sauce is always made a little thinner than white sauce) with corn-flour. If not brown enough, add a little browning.

6 THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER. embarrassments mucli of that hard earned gain is pro- cured. She will not seldom offer her whole heart-sympathy to cheer, and her practical economy to encourage the laboiirs of him who finds all his enjoyment in the felicities of home. In personal attire she will be neat and tasteful, without extravagance. To tell her that dress is not essential to tiTie dignity, that rich adornments and gaudy jewellery are not the standard by which the real lady is judged, would be to repeat what she already knows, and what her inborn sense has repudiated. With regard to her carriage towards those placed under her in the domestic circle, here we need not tell her that real, and not imaginary dilficulties will sometimes disturb her peace, and ruffle the even tenor of her way. She must have heard many ominous and clamorous complaints against those individuals called "bad servants." Her ears have been assailed by the limitless abuse cast upon them, and she has been ready to confess, that instead of "helps," they have been only burdens, or necessary evils. Let her not believe all this, allow a large deduction for exaggeration, and make it a point to judge for herself Let the wise young House- keeper be firm and kind, thoughtful, considerate, and patient. Her domestics are not slaves, they are not soul-less. Treated rationally they must, of necessity, be- come her attached friends, and like that long-lived, though nearly extinct race of servants, whose term of office was measured not by months, but by tens of years, she will hear them urging an ancient and touching plea,â€”" En- treat me not to leave thee ; for whither thou goest, I will go, and where thou lodgest, I will lodge, where thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried."

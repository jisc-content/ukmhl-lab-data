To kill geese and ducks, tie a string round the beak, and the pinions of the wings, cut the neck across deeply, quite close to the head ; they are then suspended by the feefc. to bleed freely. RABBITS AND HARES. Eabbits and hares when caught alive, are killed by holding them by the hind legs, and giving them a smart blow behind the ears. FEATHERED ANIMALS. Feathered animals should be kept for a whort time with their feathers on, after they are killed, and not drawn or gutted till they are to be used. But furred animals should be punched or gutted as soon as cold; the skin removed only when about to be used. OYSTERS. Oysters are killed by inserting the point of a sharp steel knife for the purpose, they die whenever the steel touches them, and the shell opens immediately. LOBSTERS. Lobsters are killed by putting them into a pan of boil- ing water, they are kiUed at once. Small shell-fish are killed in the same manner. The killing of animals is a necessary, although a cruel process; it is desirable that this may be committed to such as have some sort of activity about them, and firmness enough to perform this duty at once, so that a moment's agony may not be endured. c

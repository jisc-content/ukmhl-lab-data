CAKES AND SMALL PASTBY. 260 MERINGUES Are made with very light thick icing. Sift a little sugar over sheets of cartridge paper, drop the icing over them -with a table-spoon, dust some with pretty pink sugar, aud some with white, and let them remain in a cool oven till quite crisp. Take them off the paper with a knife dipped in cold water; scoop out a little of it and put in raspberry jam ; put two aud two together, and return them for a short time to the oven. They may be kept for a long time, and make a pretty dish with green leaves. They are often filled with switched cream. APPLE OK PEACH MERINGUES. Dry the syrup from preserved peaches or apples, and cover them with the meringue mixture. Keep in a cool oven till quite dry; dust them over with pink sugar. MERINGUED FRUIT CAKES Take the skins from apricots or any nice juicy plums, strawberries or rasps will do likev/ise; press the pulp through a sieve, and for half a pound of pulp put five ounces powdered sugar, and the whites of two eggs well beaten.

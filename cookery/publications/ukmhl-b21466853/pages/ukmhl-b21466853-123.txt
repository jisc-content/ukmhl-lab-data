ROASTING, BOILING, STEWING, ETC. 89 coating of forcemeat {see Index); roll and bind with broad tape. Stew very slowly four hours; unbind it, dish and pour the gravy over, having coloured it with browning, and thickened it with corn-flour. STEWED FILLET OF MUTTON, WITH TONGUE AND TURNIPS, AND OYSTER SAUCE. Soak a fresh ox-tongue in salt and water a few hours to draw out the slime; wash it well, and put it on to boil with lukewarm water. When boihng, skim very well and put into the same pot six pounds of the fillet of mutton, with a dessert-spoonful salt, and a tea-spoonful ground â– white pepper; stew two hours and a-half, skin the tongue, slice and put the slices round the dish; place the mutton in the centre. Beard one half hundred oysters, strain their juice and pour them into the gravy; give them one boil up, and pour over the mutton and tongue. Serve nicely mashed turnips in a separate dish. STEWED SHOULDER OF MUTTON. Stew a shoulder of mutton in very little water (two breakfast-cupfuls) very slowly, so that iu two hours the water will be quite absorbed and the mutton frying in its own dripping. Slice a good many large onions, lay them under the meat, and fry them quite brown; pour in two breakfast-cupfuls of boiling water, a little pepper and salt, and simmer very gently until the meat is quite tender. Dust in a little flour, and dish; you will find that the gravy is of a rich brown colour, and altogether a nice savoury dish. M

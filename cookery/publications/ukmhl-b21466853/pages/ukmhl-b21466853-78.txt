A11 French and Italian pastes for soup are vused in the same way. SAGO SOUP. The same as above, substituting one cup of washed sago, or it may be improved by the addition of one glass of sherry wine. SUMMER HOTCH-POTCH. Four pounds shoulder of mutton, and four quarts of water ; boil an hour ; add a quart of carrots and turnips cut into dice, a few carrots grated and a few minced onions.

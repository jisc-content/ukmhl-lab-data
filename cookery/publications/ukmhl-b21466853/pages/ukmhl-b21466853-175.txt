Croquettes are made into balls, and fried or stewed without paste, and are served on napkins, garnished witli fried parsley.

SWEETBREAD OMELET. Mince very finely any remains of sweetbreads, and season them nicely; for one omelet, beat up the yolks and whites of three eggs separately, stir in a dessert-spoonful of rice-flour amongst the yolks, stir in the mince, but see that it has been highly seasoned, and lastly, the whites. Stir all together, and pour into a hot frying-pan in which about an ounce of butter has been melted; hold the pan over the fire for about ten minutes, or until you think it is quite done; do not turn it but put it before the fire to brown; it will rise very light. Serve on a napkin; those who like sweet herbs, or parsley, may add them.

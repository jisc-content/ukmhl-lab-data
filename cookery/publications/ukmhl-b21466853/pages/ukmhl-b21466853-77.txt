SOUPS. 43 OX-TAIL SOUP. One pair of ox-tails, cut in two, and put on with three quarts of water, with the same quantity of vegetables and spice as for brown soup. Simmer three hours. Cut the meat in neat small pieces from the bones, strain the soup, add the meat, and thicken with two spoonfuls of flour; add browning, or put in a burnt crust of bread in the process of making the soup, which answers very well for all soupa that are not clear. OX-TAIL SOUP.—No. II. Two pounds meat made into soup, as brown soup, one ox- tail divided at the joints, and stewed in a separate pan, served in the tureen; they may be slightly browned before stewing; thickened with flour as above. AH soups that are not clear should be of a rich brown colour. JULIENNE SOUP.—(One Tukeen ) Five pounds knuckle of veal, four quarts water, a few young carrots, turnips, onions, parsley, celery, and season- ing as for brown soup. Boil slowly three hours; strain, and let it stand to settle. Remove any grease very care- fully, and clear the same as the clear brown souj), with four eggs instead of two. Have prepared a breakfast- cupful of young green pease, and another of carrot and turnip; cut in narrow stripes, as you do orange chips for marmalade, or in small fancy shapes with small vegetable cuttei-s for the purpose. Boil them a few minutes in fresh water by themselves; put them into the tureen and strain the soup over them. Be srire you have a piece of muslin in your soup-sieve.

LAYING OUT OF THE TABLE. 350 Many genteel families, when alone, dine oflf one or two dishes with vegetables, with or without some simple pud- ding. If there should not be soup at table, the whole dinner may be served at once—the fish and fish plates removed, as a matter of course—and the pudding served as usual. DINNERS FOR TWELVE & EIGHTEEN, WITH REMOVES, WITHOUT SIDE DISHES. A few whole potatoes should be served with the Fish Course, they are always acceptable, and when the suc- ceeding course is served the potatoes are either handed round or served from the sideboard. It wiU be observed that the fish and soup are placed together on the tables shown; it is not intended that they are to be served to- gether. On the removal of the soup tureens, the fisb are placed on the table. 1. FIRST AND SECOND COURSES. White Oyster Soup. Fried Soles. Cod's Head and Shoulders. Jullien Soup. THIRD COURSE. Roast Turkey.

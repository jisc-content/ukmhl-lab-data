165 SAUCES. CBAB SAUCE Is made exactly as lobster sauce, which see. SHRIMP AND COCKLE SAUCE Is made in a similar manner. ANCHOVY SAUCE. Bone and mince, or pound some anchovies, and stir into parsley butter sauce. SALAD SAUCE. Bruise the hard boiled yolks of two eggs with a little cream, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a little white and cayenne pepper, a little vinegar, and oil.

Rub a tea-spoonful of mustard with a table-spoonful of vinegar, and stir into melted butter. It is very nice with either broUed or boiled fresh herrings.

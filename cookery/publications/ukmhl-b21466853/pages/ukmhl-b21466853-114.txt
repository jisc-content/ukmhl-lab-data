Having a good steady fire made np, let your meat be placed at a distance to be warmed through, before the process of roasting begins. It is better to be hung on a roasting jack than laid in a despatch. A quai'ter of an hour is the general allowance for each pound of meat, but you must try it with a skewer, inserting it at the bone ; if you see the blood oozing out, it is not done enougb. Be sure never to punch it with a fork or skewer except at the bone; remember this particularly, as the j uice flows out of the meat, and renders the roast perfectly dry. Baste it well all the time it is at the fire, and when done strew a very little salt over it; lift a ladleful of the dripping and pour a little of it over tbe roast. Take away a good deal of the dripping from the roasting pan, put a little sa\t and boil- ing water into the pan, and strain a gravy dish full, to be served hot. This is a better plan than sending up the gravy in the dish, which is sometimes annoying to the carver, and very often cold. Those who choose can have it garnished with horse-radish. ROAST RIBS OF BEEF. Ribs of beef are roasted in the same manner as sirloin of beef, a nice Yorkshire pudding, and hoi-se radish sauco are sent to table with it.

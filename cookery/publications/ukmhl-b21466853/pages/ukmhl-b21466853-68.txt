34 THE DISHING OF COOKED MEATS FOR THE TABLE. As it is necessary that animal food should be presented in an agreeable and inviting form, a few hints may be acceptable on this subject. For Gamishings, consult Index. A sirloin of beef is dished as shewn in the Engi^aving. If a large joint, instead of sending all the gravy in the dish, pour a little over the meat, and a sauce- tureenful to table. The ashets are so shaUow that it is very inconvenient to the carver when a great quantity of gravy is sent in the dish. A BOUND OF BEEF Is served also as seen in Engraving. Remove the binding carefully; take a sharp knife and cut a thin slice from the top. Trim it all round, if necessary, pour a ladleful of the water in which it was boiled over it. ROAST OR BOILED MUTTON Is properly dished with the underside up, although it is frequently served otherwise. The knuckle end Ls placed to the left hand of the carver. HAUNCH OF VENISON OR MUTTON Is dished with the back uppermost, and the knuckle end towards the left hand of the carver. LAMB, &c. Lamb is dished as seen in the engraving ; also ham and saddle of mutton ; shoulder of mutton is dished with the back uppermost, and the neck end towards the carver.

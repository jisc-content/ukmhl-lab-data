Beard a quarter hundred of small oysters ; strain the juice; stir it and the oysters into butter sauce, with a little ground white pepper. LOBSTER SAUCE.

Mince a portion of the meat of one lobster (not nearly the half, and*t must be minced veiy fine, or pounded in a morter), with part of the spawn or coral berries, and stirred over the fire in very good melted butter. BREAD SAUCE, FOR GAME, &c.—No. L Take half a slice of bread without crust, two large onions peeled and sliced, a tea-spoonful of white pepper- corns, a blade of mace, and a little salt.

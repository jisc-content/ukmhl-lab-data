COOKEKY FOR INVALIDS. 318 SAGO AND TAPIOCA MILK. Make in the same way as the rice, Bweeteniug slightly, and making a small quantity at a time, as the milk would be sure to derange the stomach if the least turned. BEEF TEA. See previous recipes, being most particular about the cleanliness of the vessels used in the preparation. An invalid is most sensitive of this. BEEF TEA FOR INVALIDS. Soak one pound of nice tender juicy beef a few hours in two breakfast-cupfuls of cold water, with a tea-spoon- ful of salt; place it in a saucepan, with the water in which it was soaked ; pierce it with a fork, and press it; simmer it fifteen minutes, and strain it; when slops are prohi- hized, a small quantity of good beef tea may be poured over toasted bread. CHICKEN SOUP. Skin a young chicken, and draw it; soak and wash it; put it into a smjiU stew pan; cover it with cold water; when it boils skim it very carefully; add half a tea-spoon- ful of salt; simmer one hour; strain the gravy, wliich will be most acceptible to an invalid. Be careful in re- moving the fat from it. Pick the white meat from the fowl, mince it very iine, season it moderately with white pe[)per and salt, add to it a few spoonfuls of the gravy; stir it over the fire until it boils; pour one or two spoon- fuls of it over one half slice of nicely toasted bread with- out the crust.

PRESERVED FRUITS. 282 of the fruit into the preserve pan, put the sugar over it, lay on the rest of the fruit, and let it remain so for two hours, to dissolve the sugar before putting it on the fire. BoU for twenty minutes over a nice clear fire; prove it by cooling a little of it on a plate before potting it. RASPBERRY JAM Is made exactly as strawberry jam. A pint or two of red currant juice is sometimes added. PLUM JAM. Take an equal weight of sugar and fruit, wet the sugar â– with very little watei', and bring it through the boil; skim it, and put in your plums; when boiling skim again. BoU twenty minutes. Take off as many of the stones as you can, and pot the jam. DAMSON JAM Is made in the same way; as also peach, apricot, nectarine, gooseberry, rhubarb, cherry, and apple jam. DAMSON CHEESE. Put two pounds of damsons and one pound of sugar into an ironstone jar; set them in a pan of water, or put them in the oven. They must be boiled for a long time tmtil quite thick, and the juice boiled in. Pick out the stones, break them, pound the kernels, add them to the fruit, and pot or put into small moulds. Cover with bladder, and keep for use. BLACK CURRANT JAM. Allow weight for weight of sugar, pick the ben-ies from the stalks and cut off the little black top with scissors;

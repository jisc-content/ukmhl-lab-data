FISH. 64 take out the onion and stir into the gravy a dessert- spoonful curry powder, a slight seasoning of Harvey and anchovy sauce, the juice of a small lemon, salt and cayenne to taste, and a piece of butter ; put the slices of salmon into this curried sauce, and in ten minutes they will be ready; lift them out with a slice, and pour the gravy over them. Remains of salmon are nice used up in this way. PICKLED SALMON. Take the remains of a large salmon, when it comes from the table. Pick out the bones and all the skin; put it into a deep dish; boil part of the liquor that boiled the fish with a good quantity of vinegar, a few black and Jamaica pepper pease, a very small quantity of cayenne, and when cold, pour over the salmon. The cold salmon may also be pressed into small jelly pots, covered with clarified butter, or melted lard, to be turned out, when wanted, for luncheon or breakfast; dish with savoury jelly round it.

Take about two pounds of the tail piece of salmon, skin it, and take the flesh off the bone, slice it into neat sized cutlets, dip them into beaten yolks of eggs, and dredge them over with fine dry seasoned bread crumbs, fry them a nice pale brown colour, egg and crumb also, some fine large oysters, fry and heap them in the centre of the dish with the cutlets neatly round them. Fish sa-uce flavoured with lemon juice, or vinegar, may be served in a sauce boat.

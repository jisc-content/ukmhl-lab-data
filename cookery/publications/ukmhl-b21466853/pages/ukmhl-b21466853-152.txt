POULTRY AND GAME. 118 with good beef gravy in the dish, and bread sauce in a tureen. A dish of very thin nicely fried potatoes, or potato ribbons are served separately, or placed neatly round the dish, and a spray of heath in the bills. PIGEONS. Clean and truss the pigeons—six will make a nice dish—pick the meat entirely from one of them, wash the giblets, and stew the meat of the pigeon with them, and a good slice of bacon, with pepper and salt, for half-an-hour; strain the gravy from them, mince them very fine or pound them in a mortar; mix with them a few bread crumbs, minced parsley, and a hard-boiled egg; stuff the pigeons with the forcemeat, and stew them three-quarters of an hour in the gravy made from the stewed giblets and ham; when done, thicken the gravy and add ketchup, a little port wine, and minced parsley; pour the sauce over them. EOAST PIGEONS Are cooked in the same way as roast fowl, and served with veal gravy, without stuffing. BROILED PIGEONS. Chop off the head and feet, split them down the back after washing them clean, flatten them, dust over with a little white pepper and salt, and broil them over a clear fire ; serve with parsley and butter sauce in tureen. STEWED PIGEON.—Plain. Pigeons are plainly stewed in the usual way of stewing, the gravy thickened, and chopped parsley added to it.

OATMEAL PORRIDGE. There are very few individuals in Scotland who do not know how to make them, still it does hapjien that they are not well made. When the water boils put handful after handful of oatmeal to the boiling water, until you find that it is thickening, put in salt to taste, and let them boil gently half an hour, stirring them occasionally; then pour into soup plates or small bowls; sweet, skim, butter- milk, or whey is served with them. ANOTHER METHOD. Bruise in a basin what oatmeal you think will be re- quired with cold water, as in bruising starch; have the water boiling in your pan, stir the meal into it until it is boiling again; add a little salt, and boil as previous recipe. Buttermilk or whey may be substituted for water in making porridge. Wheat meal is made as oatmeal, but requires longer boiling, and is considered very wholesome. 2 K

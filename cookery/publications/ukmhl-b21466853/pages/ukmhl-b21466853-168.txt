FORCEMEATS, CUERIES, ETC. 134 white part of celery minced, and a little parsley. When ready, take out the bones and stir in one glass of port and the yolks of two eggs. Put in the beef to warm in it, but do not let it remain to boil, which would harden and spoil the flavour of the meat. ANOTHER ECONOMICAL WAY OF USING UP COLD MEAT. Chop lip a cabbage, and stew it in a little water, just sufficient for it, with a bit of butter, pepper, and salt. Slice the meat and lay it on the cabbage, just long enough to make it quite hot. Dish the meat over the cabbage. Green pease may be substituted for cabbage. A CORNER DISH OF MINCED MEAT. Take very small sized dinner rolls; cut off the tops and scoop out part of the bread; fill up the space with any nice mince, and put on the cover. This suits well for a supper dish, with very little trouble. SAUSAGES. In general, sausages can be procured better and cheaper from the butcher, who has machines for mincing and filling, than can be made in private families; but for those who reside in the country, or where it is not convenient to purchase from the butcher, a few directions and recipes are here given. PORK SAUSAGES. After cleaning the gut, cut it into convenient lengths, chop fat and lean of pork together, and season with pow- dered sage, pepper and salt; fill the skins, tie them at eaxih end with pack thread, flour them, and either fry or stew them; they are sometimes dressed over mashed potatoes.

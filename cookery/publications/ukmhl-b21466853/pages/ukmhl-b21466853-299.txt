273 HOUSEHOLD BREAD BAKING. tlie flour into a large basin of earthen-ware. Make a hole in the flour, pour the milk over the yeast slightly warmed; stir into the hole in the flour with a wooden spoon, taking in all the flour gradually, except a rim of flour round the edges; it must be the consistency of batter. Sprinkle a little flour over the top, and place it by the fire covered with a woollen cloth till morning. A tin screen is very convenient, and more suitable than setting it by the fire. Those who possess this should use it. The "setting of the sponge," as it is called, should be performed the last thing at night. Early in the morning knead the re- jnainder of your flour amongst the dough, adding a little warm milk if necessary to moisten it. Make it up into loaves, let .stand to rise an hour and a half, and bake them. Earthenware pans are the best kind to use; but if you have not them tin pans will do. Slightly butter the pans or dust them well with flour. You will know when the bread is done, by its being well risen and the crust hard. When the loaves are removed from the oven, brush them over the top with water to glaze them, or put a small piece of butter into a muslin cloth, and rub them over with it. It gives the loaves a more inviting ap- pearance. BREAD WITH FERMENT.—No. I. Make the bread as in previous recipe, but instead of yeast, double the quantity of ferment. BREAD WITH FLOUR YEAST.—No. II. Make as jjreviously, using a large breakfast-cupful of the yeast and an ounce of baking powder, mixed very thoroughly amongst the flour. 2 M

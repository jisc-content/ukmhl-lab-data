ROASTING, BOILING, STEWING, ETC. 102 for five minutes; lift out the steak and ntir the onions till quite done; dish them, and finish your steak; serve it in the same dish. For gravy, dust a little flour into the pan, with pepper and salt to taste; lef it brown, then pour in a tea-cupful of water, add a little ketchup, and pour over the dish. Fry steak in the same way without the onions. STEWED STEAK. Cut your steak into square pieces, peel a few onions, and put them whole into the water, with a Kttle pepper and salt. When boiling, put in a few suet balls, made with two ounces of suet and half a pound of flour. IMince the suet, add a little salt, and make into balls the size of eggs; use boiling water to moisten the flour, it makes them lighter. Stew altogether slowly for two hours. * BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. Make a good pudding paste, cut up either mutton or beef, season with pepper and salt, and make it up as you do apple-pudding; it will take three hours to boil. Pigeons eat nicely done in this way. VEAL CURRY. Take one and a half pounds of veal cutlet, one table- spoonful of curry powder, one table-spoonful of flour, an aijple, a little salt, and white pepper. Dust the cutlets with flour, and fry them a light brown, with a minced onion or shallot, in butter. Put them into a stew-pan with a little gravy or warm water; mince an acid apple or put in lemon juice ; stew gently half an hour, thicken with the curry and flour, and pour over the cutlets when done ; serve rice with it.

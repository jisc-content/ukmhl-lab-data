35 DISHING OP COOKED MEATS. Roast turkey, geese, and fowls are dislied with the breast towards the left hand; as also chickens, pheasants, and ducks. Pigeons and small lairds are dished in a circle round the dish, so as the feet meet in the centre. Stews, such as beef or veal olives are heaped neatly in the centre, and the gravy poured over them. Cutlets and chops are arranged round the dish, each leaning on the other, and the gravy or vegetables in the centreâ€”see Kecipes. Rabbits and hares are dished, as shown in the Engraving, with the heads towards the left of the carver j see Engraved Plates ; also, for calves' head, neck of veal, fillet of veal and tongue. Large fish are dished with the head towards the left hand ; small fish are dished head and taU, or turned round and the tail pushed through the eye ; for other ways of d ishing fish seeRecipes in Index. When fish are served without gravy in the dish, they are placed on neatly folded napkins ; and frequently when gravy is served in the dish, an under ashet, a size larger is covered with a napkin, and the dish placed on it; that is done at pleasure with meats of any kind. Entrees, where gravy is not served in the dish, are invariably served on napkins, which must be very neatly folded; cold meats are generally served on napkins. CARVING.

82 BOASTING, BOILIKG, STEWING, ETC. ROAST SHOULDER OF MUTTON. Shoulder of mutton is roasted in the same maaner, -with gravy in the dish, and onion sauce, or stewed Spanish onions. ROAST VENISON. The haunch makes the most handsome piece for roast- ing. If the venison is kept for any length of time—as most people prefer to do so—the joint should be washed, by wringing a clean cloth out of hot water and drying it thoroughly; if very bad, it will be improved by brushing it over with vinegar. Put it down to roast, baste it immediately with good melted beef dripping, and baste it well all the time; serve with it good gravy that you have made with any venison trimmings you may have, or good beef gravy, with a little port wine in it. Some persons like sweet sauce, or melted red cm-rant jelly.— See Sauces. ROAST VENISON. Shoulder or neck of venison may be roasted also, and are generally enveloped in a flour and water paste, covered over with greased paper ; they are frequently baked in the oven. For other dishes of venison (^ee Index). ROAST LAMB. Lamb is roasted in the same way as mutton, and served in its own gravy; salt and water are poured into the roasting pan, and then into the dish or sauce-boat Never, on any account, pour salt and boiling water over roasts of any kind; it not only spoils the look of the roast, but the flavour of the outside slices, which are most esteemed. Mint sauce is served also in a sauce tureen.

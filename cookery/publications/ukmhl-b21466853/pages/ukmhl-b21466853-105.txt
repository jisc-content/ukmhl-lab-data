FISH. 71 MIDDLE GUT OF COD.—Roasted. Take a middle cut of cod, skin it, brush it over with beaten egg. cover it thoroughly with sifted well seasoned crumbs, mixed with parsley; melt a piece of butter in the baking dish, and place the fish in it; it must be cooked in the oven, as in doing it before the fire the underside is never sufiiciently cooked. When the crumbs have become firm on the fish, melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, and pour over it; half an hour will do it with a good oven ; dish it without breaking, add seasoning and ketchup to the gravy in the dish, and jjour round it. MIDDLE CUT OF COD.—Boiled. The fish may be skinned if desired, but as many prefer it with the skin, it may be dressed in this manner :— Pour a little boiling water over it, scraping it quickly to remove the blackness, put it immediately in boiling salt and water; from twenty minutes to half an hour will boil it. Served with good butter or oyster sauce. SLICES OF COD. Skin a piece of cod and slice it; it may be fried, plainly boiled, or stewed with butter; if to be fried, roll the alices in flour, and fry in dripping, or egg, and bread crumb them, and fry in lard or oil. COD PIE. Fill a pie-dish with slices of cod, dust pepper and salt over each row, finely minced parsley, and small pieces of butter, shake a little fiour over them, pour in at the one side a little milk or water for sauce; a little lemon juice or vinegar may be added if liked ; the addition of a few oysters is an improvement.

Years have been passed in acquiring a little of this, and less of that, while the beautiful "simplicities" of domestic life have either been ignored or completely neglected. This has not arisen from ignorance, or from want of a due appreciation of the importance of practical housekeepmg. Inexorable fashion, with its iron hand, has swayed their better judg- ment, and has substituted the Unreal for the Real. Why should there not be a judicious combination of the usetui with the refined ?-the education of the fireside, as weU as that of the school ? Right well do we know, that the thoughtless belle, whose ambition is limited to the baU- room, the very mention of cookery is odious ; but to the loyal heart of the genuine young housekeeper, whatever tends to cheer and brighten her home, and throw a ray of sunshine upon her dwelling, is a subject of anxious solici- tude. She has learned, under the maternal eye to cul- tivate those amenities of life, which bmd faithfu. hearte the more closely, and go far to lighten the cares and toils of active life. To her, the important questions connected with domestic economy are a first and not a last thov^t^ Like the Royal Lady who wears the crown of England and of India, she is not the less queen-like because she reigns in the kitchen, as well as in the heaits of her hoi sehold. To all such young " House Moth^-s is th^ little Volume dedicated. Should it prove hdpf^il m their "honourable service" and "labour of love. ' itÂ« mission shall have been accomplished, and ii. Authoress amply rewarded.

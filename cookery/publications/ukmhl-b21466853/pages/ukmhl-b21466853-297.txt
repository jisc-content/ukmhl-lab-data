271 HOUSEHOLD BREAD BAKING. THE OVEN. A brick-built oven is the proper oven for household bread. Many of the houses now building in Scotland are having brick ovens constructed. The iron ovens attached to kitchen ranges, cooking stoves, &c., are not suitable for baking thoroughly fermented bread; and yet it is wonder- ful how with care and proper management good and palatable bread may be produced. If such should be the only kind j'^ou have to work with, the writer would recommend an entire lining of fire brick, and the oven lighted with thick pieces of wood while using it; wood fuel is most suitable for built as well as iron ovens. Always have the oven well heated before putting in the bread, and keep it at a regular heat all the time. (note.) The following recipes may appear tedious, they are not so in reality, a little patience and perseverance will over- come the seeming difficulty. Tuesdays and Fridays should be the days set apart for this duty, and it would not occupy very much time in its performance. FERMENT FOE BREAD.â€”No. I. Half an ounce of hops, a few sliced apples, four spoon- fuls of treacle, one quart water, and three quarters pound of flour; boil the hops and apples in the water twenty minutes, strain ofi" the liquor, add to it the treacle and stir in the flour. Cover lightly, and set it in a moderately warm place till fermentation takes place, which will be in a few hours.

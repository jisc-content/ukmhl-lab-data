CAKES AND SMALL PASTRY. 255 ounce of sweet spice, and the yolks of two eggs; when well kneaded cut it in two, and line the bottom of a round cake-pan with one half. Stew some apples with sugar and a few dried currants; when quite cold put them all over the cake. Roll out the other half, and cover the apples with it; bake for half an hour, and let stand till cold before taking it out of the pan; ice it all over the top, and ornament it on the top, then return it to the oven to make it crisp. SMALL SOUFFLE CAKES. Make a German paste as above, roll the paste quite thin, cut it into small biscuits the size of a tea-cup mouth, and bake them on paper; beat the whites of a few eggs to a sti^F snow, flavour with a few drops of lemon, and dust a little sugar amongst them; put a spoonful of raspberry jam in the centre of the cake; when they are baked and quite cold cover it with the white of egg and raise it neatly, smoothing with a knife in the form of a dinner roll, ornament on the top with the egg squirted through a piping-bag. Put in a cool oven to rise, but do not let them get brown. When quite cold put a little red currant jelly on the top. SWEET SANDWICHES. Make a small quantity of sponge cake, No. I.; cover a baking-tin with paper, melt a small piece of butter in it, and brush it all over; spread the cake in two rounds twice the size of a small saucer, and bake them. Put raspberry or strawberry jam between, and cut in eight pieces, three-cornered ways.

THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPEK. 7 It has almost been forgotten, in tliis little lecture, to remind the young Housekeeper, that there is also included in Domestic Economy, the "economy of time." A hint on this point may not be unserviceable. There are still many Marthas who are cumbered with much serving, impulsive, bustling, energetic, yet sadly out of the ques- tion of order and punctuality. Method is what these earnest Marthas need ; they would just do double the amount of household duty, were they methodical in going about it. Punctuality with the hours of meals, and a careful distribution of the labours of the day, would infuse such a calmness of spirit, and such a beauty of order into all that she does, as would more than ^ reward our gentle sister for all her toils. Nor let her imagine that these " little things " are little needed and little heeded. Young affection may cover a multitude of foibles; but let her be assured she will retain the heart quite as surely, and all the longer in freshness and beauty, by studying to please, even in what some may call " matters of fact." Many good husbands have been sadly changed by ill-cooked, and ill-timed dinners ; and many a critical project has been marred by an ill-regulated home. A little well-directed effort, continuously carried out, will render the duty easy and Hght; everything will fall into its proper place. Peace and joy will reigu supreme, and the "life battle," so frequently dreaded, will be fought with a success never failing, and a courage never dismayed.

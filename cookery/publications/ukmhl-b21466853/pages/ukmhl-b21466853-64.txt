PREPARATION OF FOOD. 30 roll the olives in flour, and place them in the stew pan, brown them nicely all over, not coarsely, but a pale brown; pour in two cupfuls of boiling water ; add the seasonings, as see in recipe for beef and veal olives, and simmer gently two hours ; this method is good, and may be followed for any stew, whether small or large pieces of meat. Fowls, &c., may be stewed by the same rule : the rule is, let the simmering be such that it can scarcely be observed. TO FRY Cutlets, chops, and fish should all be cooked in a cutlet pan; it has straight sides, and therefore the butter or dripping comes better up over them ; heat the pan, and have a good quantity of butter, good dripping, or lard in the pan, having them trimmed as see the recipe for them to be found in the Index, and egg and crumbed; when the pan is ready with the hot dripping, put in whatever of the above you mean to fry, and brown them nicely a pale brown, they should be quite firm; have a sieve ready prepared with blotting paper, or a soft muslin cloth iaid on it; lift the cutlets, &c., out of the pan with a slice, and drain them on the sieve; thus prepared, this method, when well done, gives greit satisfaction, as they are quite tree from grease; they should be done so that when laid on a napkin they would not soil it; for Sauces, see Index. TO BBOIL. A clear red glow of heat is necessary, and careful turning; a hot ashet should be in readiness to catch the gravy, which, in turning it, would run into the fii'e; this is in reference to steak or chops.

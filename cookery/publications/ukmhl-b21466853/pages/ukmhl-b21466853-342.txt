316 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS* This subject is one tliat is fearfully neglected. It is one on -which great ignorance is felt, and however much care and anxiety is experienced by well meaning indi- viduals -when the medical attendant prescribes this and that description of carefully prepared food or refreshing beverages, it is distressing to all parties when the pre- scription cannot be fully attended to. The following recipes will perhaps assist, although it may be in a small measure :â€” GRUEL FROM THE FLOUR OF OATMEAL. Put three table-spoonfuls of the finest oatmeal into a large basin ; pour hot water over it, stirring all the time* as much as four breakfast-cupfuls of water; let it stand a few minutes to settle; pour it clear of the grounds, and pour it into a very clean pan ; add to it two table-spoon- fuls of sugar, and let it just give one boil up to take off the rawness of the flour; pour it into a hot water jug. It remains with the physician to say whether a little wine >r a few drops of lemon juice would be safe. This gruel *The Writer would recommend every lady to purchase a copy of Miss Florence Nightingale's excellent and experimental work on the Sick CSiamber ; a work expressly devoted to these duties, is by far more useful than trusting t? mis- cellaneous directions on this most important subject. A work on Domestic Medicine, by Dr. Gardiner, of Edinburgh, would be found useful, although the personal attendance of a thoroughly qualified medical man is more satisfactory^ Application to medical works are often resorted to with a view towards economy, and is often found, in woeful experience, to be the most expensive in the end. A few simple remedies may be suggested where medical advice might really be considered of no importance.

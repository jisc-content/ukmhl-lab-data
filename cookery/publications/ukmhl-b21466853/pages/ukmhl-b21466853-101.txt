FISH. TURBOT ROASTED OR BAKED. Brush a nice small sized turbot over with beaten yolk of egg, dredge over with fine dry crumbs, season with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; melt a piece of butter in a baking tray, and place the fish on it, with the white side uppermost, of course, when the yolk of egg has become dry, so that the crumbs adhere quite firmly; pour melted butter overit, and when of anice brown colouritwill be quite cooked; half an hour should do it. Dish the turbot, and keep it hot while the sauce is being made. A good gravy wUl be found in the baking dish, to which add a table- spoonful good ketchup, half a tea-cupful of oyster juice, a Uttle cayenne, white pepper, and grated nutmeg. Stir all well together, and strain it; put into a saucepan, with a piece of butter, and thicken with flour; serve in a sauce tureen. This sauce may be made much richer by the ad- dition of Avine and oysters, and the sauce may be thick- ened with the beaten yolk of eggs instead of flour, and a httle cream and lemon juice. It may be used cold, and is very nice with vinegar. FILLETS OF TURBOT. Cut up a small turbot into convenient sized squares or • oblong pieces, soak them in salt and water a few hours, wipe them quite dry, brush them over with beaten yolk of egg, and dust them well with flour; fry them nicely in .good olive oil until of a beautiful brown; drain them • thoroughly from the oil; serve on a napkin, and in a sauce- < boat; a good butter sauce, flavoured with nutmeg and lemon juice. When the oil is objectionable, they may be boiled m lard instead, and covered with fine dry crumbs

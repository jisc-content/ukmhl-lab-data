PASTRY, PUDDINGS, TARTS, ETC. 201 DISH OF APPLES AND EICE. Boil rice in milk and water, w^itli a little sugar; drain it and dry it a little. Make a border round the ashet, spread a little over the dish; place preserved apples neatly in the centre, and pour a little of the syrup over them. Beat up the white of an egg to a snow, colour it with cochineal a pale pink, and ornament the rice with it. APPLE PUFFS. Roll out puff paste to the thickness of a quarter of an inch, and cut it out with a round cutter the size of a common tea-biscuit; put in a spoonful of apple marmalade; wet the edges and double it over; glaze with egg, sift sugar over, and bake. OPEN TART OR TARTLET. Egg a flat baking-ashet, cover it with puff paste, egg the edge, and put an edging of paste all round it; glaze with egg, and ornament with pastry leaves and roses; sift a little sugar over; fill it with any preserve you please; (if with apples or green fruit, they must be stewed). Put straps of pastry across, or an ornamental top of any kind, according to your fancy; when cold, switched cream looks pretty put over them, without any other ornament. They are sometimes dusted with pink sugar. RASPBERRY TART AND CREAM. Make a tartlet as above, fill with raspberry jam, without putting pastry over the frait, and place it in the oven; mix the yolks of two eggs with a cupful of cream and a little sugar, and pour it over the preserves when they are nearly done, and bake until set. 2 c

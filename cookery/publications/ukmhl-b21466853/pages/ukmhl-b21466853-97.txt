FISHr 63 make tliem into a nice forcemeat, witli the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, two ounces bread crumbs; season nicely with a little mace, nutmeg, ground white pepper, salt, and sweet herbs. Brush the fleshy side of the fish with beaten yolk of egg, and spread the forcemeat all over it; roll it up, and bind it firmly with broad tape; put it into a pan of boiling water, with vinegar and salt; when quite done put it into the jar you mean to keep it in, boil up the water in vs'hich it was cooked, add more vinegar and spices to it, and pour over when cold; melted lard poured over them when in the jar preserves them for a long time. Instead of binding it with tape, it is much more con- venient to skewer it firmly and place it at once into the jar, with just sufficient water and vinegar to cover it, and the spices; put the lid on the jar, and place it into a pot of boiling water, or bake it; it will take an hour's sim- mering. STEWED SALMON.â€”Genevese Mode. Stew a small grated carrot, a few parsley leaves, a bay leaf, two minced shallots, a blade of mace, and a seasoning of pepper and salt in water until a good flavour is extracted; strain it, return it to the fire, and thicken with butter, flour, and a little milk; place the slices of salmon in it, and simmer them very gently for ten minutes, lift them out with a slice when dishing them, and pour the sauce over them; the juice of a lemon, and a slight flavouring of essence of anchovies, added to the sauce ; if liked, also a little wine. CUERIED SALMON. For two slices of salmon, take a breakfast-cup of clear gi-avy stock, simmer a small onion in it for ten minutes,

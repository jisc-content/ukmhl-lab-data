PREPARATION OF FOOD. 31 TO BAKE. Baked meat, unless under cover as a pie, is not an economical method of cooking; it should be turned and basted occasionally, but not salted until it is baked ; the time calculated is a short time less than for roastino-. Fish is baked in a very short time, by the time it is browned on the top, it is done. A pie of uncooked meat of four or five pounds will take two hours, the cover will be ready before that time ; when the paste is ready, place the pie on the hot plate to finish, or cover it with a paper slightly gi-eased, and leave the oven door slightly open. The oven for pastry must be good, hot, but not scorching; if cold the paste will run all over the dish ; and when pastry is in the oven, the door must be opened as seldom as possible. A green fruit tart of four pounds will take an hour; rich cakes, such as plum or seed cake must ha^-e a very moderate oven, and an equal heat kept up all the time. A fruit cake takes no longer to bake than a cake without fruit; if four pounds weight it will require two hours. In trying whether a cake is done, never use a knife for the purpose; take a clean skewer and insert it in the centre of the cake, which is the thickest part of it; if dry, then the cake is done; if well raised in the centre and cracked, and well browned, the cake will be sure to give satisfaction. Small biscuits require careful watching; they are baked in a few minutes. Shortbread does not require a very hot oven ; a cake of nearly two pounds weight will take from three quarters of an hour to an hour; a light tea cake of two pounds weight will take an hour.

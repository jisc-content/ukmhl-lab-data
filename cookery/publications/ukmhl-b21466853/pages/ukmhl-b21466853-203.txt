169 VEGETABLES AND ROOTS. STEWED CABBAGE. Cut out the stem, and slice whatever cabbages you re- quire ; after washing them well, drain them and put them into a pan of boiled â– watei", with salt, and a very small quantity of carbonate of soda; boil for a quarter of an hour, drain and press the water well from it, chop it up, and put it into a saucepan, with a piece of butter, and a seasoning of white pepper; stir it gently over the fire until the butter is quite melted, and serve to roast lamb or cutlets. SAVOY CABBAGE. The leaves are all separated in cleansing them, and boiled in the same manner as stated above; strained, chopped up, and a bit of butter put amongst the leaves. GREENS Are very much used in winter, with corned-beef, tongues, hams, &c.; but they should be boiled by themselves in the same way as cabbages; the leaves are stripped from the stalks. When boiled with salt meat they spoil its colour > but as most people like them to have the flavour of the meat, after straining them, they should be allowed ten minutes in the pot along with it. They are dished either round the meat or in a vegetable dish. BRUSSELS SPROUTS. After washing them, throw them into boiling water with salt and soda; boil twenty minutes, and serve plain, or with butter sauce over them, with which they are de- lightful. They make a pretty garnish round a tongue or round of beef. Y

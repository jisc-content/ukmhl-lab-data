112 POULTRY AND GAME. ROAST GOOSE. After trussing, stuff the breast with bread crumbs, a little powdered sage, minced parboiled onion, a little pep- per and salt, and bind with yolk of egg. It does not re- quire much basting, as it is so greasy of itself. Most people prefer to boil it for twenty minutes before putting it down to roast; this takes away the oily flavour. Make a nice gravy with the giblets. Serve apple sauce in a sauce-boat. BRAISED GOOSE. Truss a goose for boiling and put it into a pan that will just hold it, cover it with water and add a small quantity of cut carrot, turnip, onions, celery, and parsley; when boiling remove the scum, and add a few pepper pease, a few sage leaves, and salt to taste ; cover up close, and simmer until the goose is quite done. Strain the gravy and take the fat from it, keep the goose hot, and boil the gravy rapidly down to a nice thick glaze, and pour over it. ROAST DUCKS. Proceed exactly as for roast goose, with the same kind of stuffing and sauces, a little cayenne; and port wine in the gravy is sometimes wished. STEWED DUCK WITH GREEN PEASE. Stew a duck until it is nearly done; chop a lettuce, a few green onions, put them into the stew-pan with the duck, add a quart of young green pease, a handful of chopped parsley, a piece of butter, and a seasoning of pepper and salt, with a teaspoonful of sugar; dredge them all over with flour, and stew ten minutes; pour the peaÂ«e and gravy all over and round the duck.

Pheasants, par- tridges, and other game birds, may be tested much the same as poultry. The flavour of game is much improved by being kept some time before using it, although this is carried to a ridiculous extent by some parties, who think them unfit for use, until they have become quite putrid, and really enjoy them in this state. VEGETABLES. Vegetables are to be had in great variety at any season of the year, and as each season tells its own tale, it is only wasting time to enlarge upon it. BUTTER Is easily known to be good or bad by merely tasting it. Milk is tested in the same way. Eggs are often not known to be unfit for use until served at table; one test is to hold them close up to the gas-light, shading them with the hand, if they appear marbled they are stale. FRUITS. The same remarks are applicable to fruits as to vege- tables, every season speaking for itself, by sending in naturally its successive supply. Besides our own coun- try supply, other countries contribute largely in supply- ing the markets. HAM AND BACON Are known to be good by the general appearance; if the fat is of a yellow tinge it is becoming rancid, and should be avoided. Pierce it, if it smells sweetly, it is good.

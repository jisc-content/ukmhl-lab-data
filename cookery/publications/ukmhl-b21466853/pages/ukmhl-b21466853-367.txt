LAYING OUT OF THE TABLE. 341 gravy spoons and sauce ladles, where required, table mats, and two or four water carafes, with, a tumbler and wine glass for each person placed at the right hand. If cham- pagne is to be served, a glass for champagne is also placed. Also z neatly folded napkin with a roll in it. Cover the side table, or the centre of sideboai'd, with a tablecloth, and place everything on it required, to prevent confusion and lea^Ting the room,—extra knives and forks, spoons, glasses, &c. Above all things, see that the carving knives are in proper order; steels placed on the dinner table for gentlemen, to prepare the knives before proceeding to carve is most distasteful, especially when ladies are present. It is a com- fort to all parties, especially to the lady of the house, when those in attendance are thoroughly qualified to perform their duties with activity, yet with calmness, and precision, and it is necessary for them to possess respectful manners. When persons of contrary dispositions are selected there is a want of order, consequently a want of comfoi-t is felt, which considerably annoys the guests, and keeps the lady in a fever of excitement, destroying the pleasure and happiness of every one. Such a state of affairs is very frequently experienced, and should be studiously avoided.

When the family or guests are assem- bled, lift the covers carefully from the tureens. In handing the plates they are presented at the left side, so that they can be taken with the right hand. Let the other course be taken into the dining room with the covers over them, placed on the sideboard, and the covers removed before placing them on the table,

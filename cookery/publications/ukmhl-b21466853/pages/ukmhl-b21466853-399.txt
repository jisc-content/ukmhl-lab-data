ARTICLES IN SEASON. 373 SOLES Are in season nearly all the year round, and should be, when good, of a creamy white, and thick in the body,â€” when of a bluish tinge, they are not good. FLOUNDEES Should be chosen as above. HERRINGS Are in season at different periods of the year. The west coast herring fishing begins in June, when the famous Lochfine herrings are brought to market, also abundance of fine herrings from Campbelton. They continue good during the summer mouths. The Forth supplies Edin- burgh with fine winter herrings, they are caught in the neighbourhood of Inchkeith, and on the Fife coast. They are also abundant on the east coast, in the neigh- bourhood of Dunbar. The north send great quantities of herrings to market, and in many of our Islands her- rings supply the inhabitants with a large proportion of their food. They should feel quite stiff when fresh, the gills red, with very bright scales. MACKEREL Are in season from May till July, and are easily known to be fresh, by smelling them. It is best not to trust to appearances in choosing mackerel, as they are very bad 2f not quite fresh. If tainted in the least avoid them. TROUT Are in season from the beginning of May till the end of August. OYSTERS Are in season all the months of the year, except May, June, July, and August.

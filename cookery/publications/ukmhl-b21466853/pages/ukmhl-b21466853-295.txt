269 ICINGS FOE CAKES AND PASTRY. ALMOND PASTE. Blanch and dry half a pound of Jordan almonds, and an ounce of bitter almonds ; pound them in a mortar with a spoonful of orange flower water, and four ovmces of sugar ; it should be rubbed through a sieve ; heat it in a small sugar pan, stirring it continually, until it is so dry that it will not adhere to the pan; mix it with the white of an egg, six ounces of sifted sugar, and flour sufficient to make it into a firm paste. ALMOND BISCUITS. Blanch and mince half a pound of Jordan almonds; dry them; put them into a dish with a quarter pound of sifted sugar, a sjjoonful of flour, two eggs, and two dozen drops of essence of bitter almonds or orange flower. Mix them all into a paste, oil a baking tin, or heat and rub it over with white wax, spread the paste all evenly over it rather thin; when half baked, cut it out in small round, oval, or diamond shapes; return them to the oven to become sliglitly browned. They might be cut out and baked in small pattie pans of various shapes, and kept as cases for serving sweets or dried fruits for dessert. NOUGAT PASTE. Nougat is a mixture of dried almonds and sugar, boiled without water, until the sugar is almost dry, and used for making small baskes or moulds to hold sugar, hon hons, or sweets for dessert; it is much cheaper to purchase them when wanted, besides, it wastes a great deal of time making them ; there are also a great many fancy knick- nacks that are quite superfluous, and shall not be included as recipes.

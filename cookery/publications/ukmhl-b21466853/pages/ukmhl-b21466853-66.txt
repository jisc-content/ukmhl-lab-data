32 THE GENERAL ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN. It is unnecessary that the slightest waste takes place; beginning with fuel, small coal should be used up regularly every day along with the larger pieces, and fires kept only in accordance with what is required. It is true that one individual will save one half of the coals that another, similarly placed, will use. Supposing that to be the habit in relation to everything under such a one's charge, how very material the difierence must be in point of economy. In breaking coals break them by the seam and not across; this method saves labour, and a great waste in breaking them. In making up the fire for the night, see that it is done in such a manner that it may keep in all night; and that the water boiler is filled. Have always wood chips at hand in case of emergency. From the abundant supply of water its waste never seems to be thought of; it is not the less sinful to waste it on that account. Gas is often thoughtlessly burned when it is in reality not required. In private well-regulated families the gas ought to be turned off at the meter at a regular hour; a great saving is effected by this rule. When this is done the jets should be carefully turned off in the different apartments; when this has been neglected it is very dangerous to enter a room with a light where gas escapes; serious accidents have been the result. Bones and trimmings of meat and poultry should be added to the Stock Pot or a rich gravy drawn from them, which would be convenient to reserve for many purposes.

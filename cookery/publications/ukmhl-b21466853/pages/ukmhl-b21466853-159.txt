125 SAVOURY PIES AND PUDDINGS. EOOK PIE. Chop off the head and feet, cut away the back bones and skin the rooks, soak them in salt and water a few hours, or sprinkle a little vinegar over them, and let lie a short time and wash off.

Put them in the pie case. Boil an ox-tongue, peel, and trim it. Put in a hare at the other side, and fill up with what other game you have. Put on the cover and bake four hours in a good oven. Pour in the gi'avy when the pie is nearly done. SHROPSHIRE PIE Is made of rabbits and pork. Cut them in pieces; put in a few oysters and forcemeat balls, and bake.

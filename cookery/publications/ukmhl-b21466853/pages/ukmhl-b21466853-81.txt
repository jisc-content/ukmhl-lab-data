47 SOUPS. ONION SOUP Is made the same way, only instead of carrots a great many onions. MOCK TURTLE SOUP. The half of a calf's-head is sufficient for a tureen of mock turtle, if a good one; but a half-fed one suits equally well. After soaking and well-washing it, put it on to boil with a small knuckle of ham (about two pounds weight), carrot, turnip, celery, parsley, onions, and a few sweet herbs (that is, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, and sweet basil, which should predominate), peppercorns, and a few cloves. When they have all boiled together one hour, take out the head; take off the skin by itself, and cut it in rather oblong small pieces. This should resemble the tripe of the turtle. Cut the meat, including the tongue, after skinning it, in neat small pieces. Return all the bones to the soup, and let all boil slowly together another hour. Strain and add the meat. Boil a quarter of an hour; and thicken with a spoonful of flour, and one dessert-spoonful of curry powder. Add a few glasses Madeira or any other wine you please, and one dozen small forcemeat and egg balls.â€”See Force-Meat Eecipe. LEEK SOUP. Truss a large fowl as for boiling; put it on with cold water and a small piece of mutton, to make it richer. Slice a great many leeks, to make the soup quite thick with them, and season with pepper and salt. Make up about half-a-dozen of suet balls with oatmeal instead of flour, and boil them in the soup. To prevent them breaking, it is best to tie them separately into pieces of muslin. The fowl may be served whole in the soup, taken

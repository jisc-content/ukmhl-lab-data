CARVING. 38 FOWLS. Fowls are carved by fixing the fork firmly into the breast; cut off a wing and leg on one side; cut down the merrythought; then cut thin slices the whole length of the breast; serve out what is already carved, giving a choice. Divide the joint of the leg, thus making two helpings, and the same with the wing. A little stuffing and gravy is served with it. Carve the other side in the same" way, if required. Pheasants and partridges are carved in the same manner. Geese and ducks are car^^ed in much the same manner. Stufied fowls, when boned, are carved across as tongue is carved. Pigeons are cut in two from head to taU. COVER OF A PIE. The cover of a pie is carved by cutting the cover in triangular pieces from the centre to the sides. Two pieces only are carved before taking out and serving the meat; a piece of paste is served with the meat, and a little gravy Plum or any pudding of the same stiffness, is carved in slices from the centre. Other puddings, jeUies and creams, are helped with spoons, as a matter of course. Cheese should not be cut in thin sHces, but in small thick Pi^^'^- FISH.

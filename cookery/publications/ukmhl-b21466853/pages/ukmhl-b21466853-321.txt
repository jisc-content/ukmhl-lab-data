Put the whole of the vegetables in it, and boil for one minute; â–  drain them instantly ; put a clean cloth over the sieve, and let them drain twelve hours. Put them into your jar. Take two ounces of fresh curry powder, the same of mustard flour, one ounce of ground white pepper, and make them into a quite smooth paste, with a little vinegar; boil two bottles of vinegar, stir the spices in when boiling, and pour over the pickles. Stir them up to mix well; put a plate over the jar, and next day cover with skin. In three months begin to use them; the longer they are kept, the better they become. ARTICHOKES. Gather young artichokes as soon as they are formed; boil salt and water, and throw them in one minute; drain and dry them, put them in jars, and cover with cold vinegar. PICKLED CHERRIES.

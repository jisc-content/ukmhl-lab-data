Cabbage must be well looked to in cleansing, on ac- count of slugs, with which it is often infested. The cabbage should be stripped of their outer leaves; cut in four across at the root end (but not divided), and laid in salt and water half an hour before boiling; let the water boil and then put in the cabbage, keeping it as whole as you can; put in a bit of soda and a little salt When the cabbage falls to the bottom of the pot it shotdd be drained immediately and served quite plain; or if young, pressed and served as spinage. It is very nice wth a butter sauce over it.

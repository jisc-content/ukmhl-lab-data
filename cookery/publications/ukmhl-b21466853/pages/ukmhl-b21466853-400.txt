AUTtCLES IN SEASON. 374 LOBSTERS AND CRABS Are in season from April to October, and may be had all the year round. MEATS WHEN IN SEASON. Beef is in season all the year round, but in the winter months when it can be hung a short time before cooking, it is much more tender. In purchasing beef at the mar- ket, choose that of a bright red colour, open grained, the fat a pale yellow, the suet white and firm, and you may be sure of its being young and very good. If it is dark in the colour, closely grained, and the fat of a strong odour, you may be sure of its being bull beef, the flavour of which is very rank. Well fed beef will be found intergrained with fat; lean beef is inferior in quality and is not economical; ox beef is generally con- sidered the best. MUTTON Is in season all the months of the year except the latter period of spring and the summer months; and in pur- chasing it choose small-boned short-legged mutton, the fat pure white and the flesh a clear red. When the fat is yellow the quality of the meat is bad. LAMB Is in season all the summer months, although a little is brought to market in the eai-ly months of spring, at which time it is a rarity, and very costly. Choose that which looks quite fresh, look under the kidney, and if it looks the least bluish it is stale. VEAL Is in season, and may be had all the year round; it is scarce in the winter, and very expensive. Choose it finely

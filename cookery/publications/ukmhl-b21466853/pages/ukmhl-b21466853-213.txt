VEGETABLES AND ROOTS. 179 minutes, pour the water from tliem; cover them again with boiling water and salt; pour and steam them when done; this takes away the earthy flavour, is a superior method, and is worth the trouble. FRIED POTATOES.—No. I. Boil and slice the potatoes, put some nice dripping in a frying-pan, and when it is hot dust a little flour over the potatoes and fry them. This is a good way of using up cold left potatoes. FRIED POTATOES.—No. II. Peel potatoes and cut them as thin aK possible; put some lard in your frying-pan and fry them; drain them in a sieve as they are done, and cover the bottom of the pan with only one row at a time; they may be dipped in butter and fried. MASHED POTATOES. Peel and boil potatoes; mash them with a potatoe beater till quite smooth; put in a bit of butter or good dripping, and a little salt; take two large forks and beat them light, fill your dish, and brown before the fire. If the potatoes are of a dry mealy quality, the forks will do to mash them without using the beater. POTATO BALLS. Make up mashed potatoes in the form of eggs, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry a nice brown. BROILED POTATOES. Peel and boil them, cut them in two, and broil them; serve with cold butter, or pour butter sauce over them.

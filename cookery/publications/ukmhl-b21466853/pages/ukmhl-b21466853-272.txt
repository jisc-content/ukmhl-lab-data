Fill a rather deep dome-shaped cake-mould with pre- served peaches; make a large quantity of good calves' feet jelly, rather a little stronger than usual, and colour part of it a pretty pink; pour in some of the jelly in the mould, so that it will be at the top about an inch deep. When cold, pour in a little more of the jelly, a pale lemon colour, and when that is set, pour the mould full of the rest of the jelly, coloured amber. When quite fii-m, turn out in a dish, with a pretty light ornamental border of crystallised rings, kept together with barley-sugar ; spin it all round with the sugar, and over the top, by dipping a fork, and running it round quickly. When the sugar gets too hard, hold the pan over the fire, a minute; frost it aU over with pink and white sugar. GOOSEBERRY FOOL.

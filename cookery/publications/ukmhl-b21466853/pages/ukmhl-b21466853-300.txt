274 HOUSEHOLD BREAD BAKING. BREAD WITH GERMAN YEAST. "Weigli fourteen pounds of flour, mix one ounce of salt thoroughly amongst it; warm two quai-ts mUk, bruLse three ounces nice fresh German yeast with part of it, add the rest gradually, and knead into a firm dough; let it be placed covered up to rise in a warm place two hours. Make it up into loaves, and bake at once. Water will do instead of milk, if milk is thought too extravagant. UNFERMENTED BREAD. For every pound of flour take two tea-spoonfuls of "Mackay's Baking Powder," and half a tea-spoonful salt; mix very well with the hand, and press through a hair sieve. Pour cold milk or cold water over it, mixing well with a spoon just enough liquid to make it into dough that will not stick to your fingers. Dust baking pans with flour, and bake immediately. This bread is close grained, but very light and of easy digestion, and most suitable for bilious persons, as yeast bread invariably sours on a weak stomach. RICE BREAD. Wash and pick one pound of Carolina rice, put it into a pan of boiling water, more than will cover it; simmer twenty minutes; by this time the rice will have absorbed the water and be comparatively soft. Take one breakfast- cupful of good yeast, stir two of warmed milk amongst it, stir it amongst the rice, and add flour to it, kneading it well with the hands until it is a good fii-m dough. Make it into loaves, and set it in a warm place to rise; when well risen bake in the usual way.

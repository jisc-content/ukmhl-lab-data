Pastry, Jellies, Fruits, Confectionery, and Beverages, of whatever description they may be, with or without ices. Many more tables might be shewn, the foregoing are merely suggested, as the variety and quantity must be regulated by the number of invited guests. For marriagf breakfast or luncheon, the napkins covering the dishe? are ornamented with small white favours at the corners. The table napkins are folded in a peculiar manner, so that a small bunch of flowers are fixed in them. As practical instructions are given in folding table napkins, it is un- necessary to dwell on this subject. SMALL SUPPER PARTIES. Late dinners have generally rendei*ed suppers unneces- sary, but for the benefit of those who dine early, and are accustomed to make supper the evening meal, a few small tables are shewn. Supper is to many the most social and comfortable meal of any, especially to those whose pur- suits occupy the principal portion of the day. Those who from habit do not take supper, always sulfer more or less from an occasional indulgence; but according to Macaulay, a high medical authority, those who have been always accustomed to take supper are never the worse but the better for partaking of that meal. When the cloth is laid, small supper plates, knives and forks, supper rolls, or cut pieces of bread, with other requisites, are placed on the table. Potatoes are generally handed round; if they are served whole, which is generally the case for supper, they are served with a folded napkin in the dish. 3a

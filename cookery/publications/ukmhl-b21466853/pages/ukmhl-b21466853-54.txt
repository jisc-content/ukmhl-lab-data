20 BONING. TO BONE A TURKEY. Having singed a turkey, and drawn the sinews from the legs, cut off the head and neck, and leave four or five inches of the skin of the neck, as mil be seen at directions for drawing a turkey. Turn over the turkey on its breast, and cut up the skin right up the centre of the back towards the neck. Pause and think well of what you are to be about. You are to remove the skin and flesh in. one entire piece, leaving a skeleton of the bones. Take a sharp pen- knife, and scrape the meat entirely from the bones, begin- ning at each side of the back, down to each side of the breast, leaving the last bone of the leg and the last two joints of the wings. It is necessary to leave them un- touched, as it is difficult to put them into the natural form again. When the bones have been removed, sew the tur- key half up with strong thread. Have an ox tongue boiled, skinned, and the bones and coarse pieces of the root removed. Spread veal stuffing to the thickness of half an inch all over the inside of the turkey; put the tongue into the turkey, with the top into the breast, and the'point downwards. Sew it up, and put the skin of the neck over the back, and sew it down in the usual way. Turn it over and truss it for roasting. Instead of the tongue, three pounds of pork sausage meat, mixed with half a pound of grated bread, seasoned with white pepper, salt, and, if liked, a few sweet herbs, may be substituted. It is used cold. Some fowls' are sometimes boned and stuffed, with pork tongue boiled, or sausage meat. When foucompany they are glazed and ornamented.

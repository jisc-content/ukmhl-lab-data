Bruise the fruit, break the cherry stones, and pour boiling water over them, let them stand for a week, stirring them up occasionally; strain through a sieve, and then through a jelly bag. For one gallon of juice, give one pound of sugar, and a pint of rum or British brandy; jar it, and in a month bottle it. Gooseberries, rhubarb, or grapes, are made into wine in the very same way as directed for red and black currant wine. CHERRY BRANDY. Half fill quart bottles with fine ripe Morella chemes; put two ounces of sifted loaf sugar over them, and fill up the bottle with brandy; British brandy is suitable for this purpose, and is only half the price of foreign. NOYEAU. Weigh one pound of bitter, and one pound of sweet almonds, and three pounds of sifted loaf sugar. Pound the almonds to a fine paste, with part of the sugar ; put them into a jar and pour one gallon of gin over them. Let them remain ten days, and filter through blotting paper, and bottle it. CURACOA. Peel the rhind from two large lemons for each bottle ; put into a quart bottle, with one pint of strong Scotch whisky. In a month take out the lemon peel and fill up the bottle with thick sugar syrup; cork tightly in three days; add in each bottle a very little powdered alum, and carbonate of potash, and in a week it is fit for use 2q

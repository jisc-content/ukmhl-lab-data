42 SOUPS. it may be well to mention here that the soup must be boU- inf^ at the time, the flour to be bruised with cold water, as you do starch, and poured in gradually, stirrmg the soup from the bottom aU the time. Sago and tapioca should be soaked in cold water an hour, and allowed to boil a few minutes amongst the soup. KIDNEY SOUP. The stock for one tureen may be made of three pounds of meat and one kidney. Make the stock exactly as the brown soup; boil the kidney whole, and when all have simmered slowly four hours, strain the soup. Put it on to come through the boU; grate the kidney; add it, and thicken with corn-flour as above, a little browning, if necessary and ketchup. KIDNEY SOUP.—(AifOTHER Wat.) Three pounds meat, and one pair of kidneys. Stock made as above; the kidney sliced, and each slice cut into four, soaked in salt and water, and stewed separately fi-om the soup. Some people object to the first water of the kidney; in that case, they are stewed about a quarter of an hour, the water poured off, and fresh warm water put over them, stewed very slowly, and added to the soup when wanted. KIDNEY SOUP—No. IH. The same as foregoing, only stew the kidneys until quite tender, pick and wash them clean in warm water, strain the gi-avy in which they have been stewed, add it to the soup* wipe the pieces of kidney, dust them with flour, fry them a nice brown, and add to the soup.

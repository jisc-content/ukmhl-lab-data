248 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. tion is commonly 17 per cent. The disadvantage of animal food is its absence of carbohydrates, so that it is not so well adapted for producing energy, unless a great deal of fat is pre- sent. Vegetable foods tend to increase fat within the body, as seen in the fattening of herbivorous animals, but a too exclu- sive vegetable diet, owing to the increase of mineral matter ingested, favours the calcareous degeneration of arteries, phos- phatic gravel in the urine, and deposits of "tartar7' on the teeth. With all these, it has to be said that the average Englishman consumes far too much animal food, and that he would do well to imitate the Frenchman, or even the Scot, in his more extended use of vegetables, lowering the proportion of flesh to vegetables to | or so, and in so doing he would not only have a healthier body in his skin, but a clearer, harder head, and money in his pocket into the bargain. For a healthy diet there are required (1) water, to the ex- tent of 70 to 80 ounces daily, either as such or in foods; (2) salts, which form an integral part of all tissues. Alkaline salts serve to neutralize the sulphuric acid arising from oxida- tion of sulphur, and the withdrawal of common salt, besides other symptoms, causes albuminuria. (3) At least one pro- teid; (4) one fat or digestible carbohydrate; (5) a certain amount of sapidity or flavour. In order to preserve the bodily balance, so as neither to gain nor lose, the quantity of food supplied must just be sufficient and no more, must contain the several proximate principles in the proper proportion, must be diges- tible, and in good condition, wholesome and free from any- thing prejudicial to health. By repeated experiments it has been found that the proper proportion of nitrogenous to non- nitrogenous materials should be 1 to 3^, or at most ±h, the figures for cow's milk being 10:30, for human milk 10:37, and for wheaten flour 10:46.

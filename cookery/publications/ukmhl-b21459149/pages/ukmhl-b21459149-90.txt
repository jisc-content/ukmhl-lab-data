84 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. glycogen, stored up for further treatment, and it finally passes the blood on to the heart by the hepatic vein. The liver consists of two large lobes, but even by the naked eye these can be resolved into small lobules, about the size of a pin-head; and as each lobule may be looked upon as a liver in miniature, we shall get a clear idea of the struc- ture and functions of that organ by studying a sinsde lobule. When the blood-vessels supplying the liver are injected with some colouring material, say Berlin blue in the portal vein and carmine in the hepatic artery, the lobule is seen to present a radiated appearance when cut. Fairly large capillary brunches of the portal vein and hepatic artery lie on the outside, in the connective tissue l>etween the lobules, the branches of the former being called inter-lobulnr veins (Lat. inter, between); while numerous capil- laries pass from these like spokes of a wheel into the centre of the lobule, collecting there into a single vessel, the This latter is a branch blood from the liver, so Fi(?. 19.â€”The Portal Vein and its Tributaries. 1 Vein from stomaeh and duodenum; 2, splenic vein; 3, portal vein; 4, inferior mesenteric vein; 5, superior mesenteric vein; (i, superior hoemori'lioidal vein; 7, sto- nuich turned back. intra-lobular vein (Lat. intra, within), of the hepatic vein, Avhich conveys that there is in each lobule a sort of centripetal circulation, blood coming to the liver finding its way to the outside of the lobules, then passing to the centre into an intralobular vein, and draining off to the heart by the hepatic vein. Lying lengthways between the spoke-like capillaries, the reveals the liver-cells, which constitute the active microscope inch in parts of that organ, little elongated bodies -twgtt diameter. These secrete bile and glycogen, store up the latter

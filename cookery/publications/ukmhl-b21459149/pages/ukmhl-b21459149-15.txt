FOOD AM) ITS FUNCTIONS. Part L—CHEMICAL PRELIMINARIES. Lesson 1.—CARBON. If a slice of bread be examined, two structures become apparent—the crust and the crumb. The latter, constituting the mass of the loaf, is white, porous, and comparatively taste- less, except for the salt and sugar added by the baker. It is easily softened by water, but yields very little to the water except the two substances already named. The crust, on the other hand, is dark-brown or even black, gummy-looking on the top, having a characteristic bitterish taste suggesting treacle, and fairly soluble in water, yielding a brownish solution. On toasting this slice before the fire, the following changes are observed:— First steam rises, showing that bread contains a_ certain amount of water, mixed with it in the process of baking, and therefore easily driven off by heat. When the steam has all disappeared the crumb begins to get yellowish, then brown to almost black, and if the process be stopped at this stage and the apparently burned toast soaked in water, or floated on the surface, the water will become brown, showing that out of the white crumb there has been produced a new substance soluble in water, of a brown colour and tasting very like the original crust. What this substance is will be seen later on. Now let the toasting be continued till the bread becomes a mass of charcoal; when this occvirs the bread has been carbonized, or turned into Carbon, which will by and by go on fire. As it burns there come off invisible vapours, which may be caught by holding over it an inverted tumbler, and a dimness produced in the tumbler shows that one of these vapours is water. This is not the water used to make the bread, for all that lias been expelled in the toasting; it is chemically-formed water,

88 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. in the tissues. It is suggested that the pancreas assists in the consumption of sugar in the blood by supplying the latter, through the lymph stream, with a sugar-consuming or glyco- lytic ferment, and pancreatic diabetes is now a well-recognized variety of the graver kind. SUMMARY. 1. All blood from the intestinal canal, containing soluble food- stuffs, passes through the liver. 2. This blood is collected by the portal vein, which again distri- butes it to the liver, thus having capillary vessels at either end. 3. The liver receives its own blood-supply by the hepatic artery. 4. Out of portal blood the liver cells manufacture glycogen or liver-starch, and out of all blood they form bile and urea, which are excreted. 5. Bile is thus a waste product, but useful as an auxiliary in digestion. 6. All carbohydrates become glycogen, and are either consumed as such, or possibly stored as fat. Lesson 18.â€”BLOOD. The whole object of digestion has been said to be the trans- formation of food into a soluble diffusible form, so that by absorption it may become fit for entering the circulation and finally becoming blood. Before describing the mechanism by which this liquid store of energy is carried to the several organs of the body, it will be advisable to examine blood itself. Looked at superficially, Blood is a reddish, thickish fluid, slightly alkaline to the taste, and possessing a peculiar smell. The saying, " Blood is thicker than water", is literally true, for the specific gravity of blood is from 1045 to 1075, water being 1000, and this "thickness" is found to be chiefly due to the presence in it of very minute red bodies called Red Cor- puscles. So numerous are these that blood behaves like an opaque colour, such as vermilion ground up in water, and Avhen spread on a printed page completely obscures the type. When seen under the microscope these little bodies are found to be biscuit-shaped, hollow in the centre, and almost colour-

VEGETABLE FOODS. 101 extreme north of Europe, maize having the greatest range of temperature. Their seeds dry easily, and can be stored in granaries or shipped without loss, and the proportion of nutriment to bulk, already large, is increased by storage, owing to loss of water. They contain from 5 to 14 per cent of nitro- genous matters, chiefly in the form of glutin, while the bulk of the grain consists of starch, the whole enclosed in a covering of cellulose often silicated. Owing to peculiarities in the glutin, the only cereals suitable for bread-making are wheat and rye; but all of them can be made into cakes, porridge, or puddings, as well as used in soups. By the process of grinding, the outer coats of cellulose are first removed, and to obtain a nutritious meal or flour the grinding should be arrested at this stage, since the cells con- taining glutin lie next the outer surface. The salts in grain, as determined from the ash, depend very largely on the kind of soil and the manure employed, if any. They consist chiefly of phosphates of soda and potash along with lime and magnesia, with a little silica and iron. The following tables will afford materials for a comparison of the different grains with each other, and with the meal or flour derived from them:â€” Grain. Proteids. Fat.

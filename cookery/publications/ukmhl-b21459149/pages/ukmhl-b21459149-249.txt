AERATED AND MINERAL WATERS. 239 3. Alcohol diminishes the sensation of hunger, and so is of great use in temporary want. 4. It excites the vascular system, accelerates the circulation, and therefore the muscles and nerves are more active because of their greater blood-supply. In large doses the vessels are paralysed, thus becoming dilated, resulting in a fall of the bodily temperature. SUMMARY. 1. Wines consist of grape-juice naturally fermented. 2. Natural wines contain from 7 to 10 per cent of alcohol, never more than 14 per cent. 3. Wines for the British market are "fortified" till they contain 20 per cent and more of alcohol. 4. Eed wines owe their colour to the retention of the pigment in the grape-skins. 5. Sparkling wines have been bottled before the completion of fermentation. 6. Cider is apple wine, but contains malic instead of tartaric acid. 7. Beer is made by the fermentation of malt or sugar, and con- tains 5 to 8 per cent of alcohol in this country, on the Continent 2 to 5 per cent. 8. Beer contains a considerable proportion of fobd-stuffs, often 14 per cent, in the shape of sugar and malt-extract. 9. The physiological limit of alcohol is 1^- ounce of absolute alcohol per day; within this it is valuable for tissue-saving purposes, but outside of that is injurious. Lesson 41.â€”AERATED AND MINEEAL WATERS. Amongst non-alcoholic beverages must be included the large class of waters, charged either naturally or artificially with carbonic acid and other gases, and the simplest of these is the so- called Soda Water. Ordinary drinking-water is really aerated, and when its air has been expelled by boiling the water thus treated is comparatively insipid, hence distilled water as made in the condensers of ships has to be aerated in various ways in order to become palatable. On a large scale the carbonic acid gas is generated from limestone or marble chips by means of hydrochloric acid, thus

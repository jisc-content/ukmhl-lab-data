Now for the heat expenditure. The waste products leaving the body—urine, faeces, and expired air—are all heated to nearly blood-heat, and there is a considerable amount of heat used in evaporating water from the lungs and skin, as under:— 1,900 grams excreta heated 25° C. = 47,500 calories, or 1-9 % 13,000 „ air „ „ 84,500 „ 3-38 330 „ water evaporated by the lungs, 192,060 „ 7-68 660 „ „ „ „ skin, 384,120 „ 15-37 Total heat loss from these sources, 708,180 „ 28-33 Eemainder lost by radiation from skin, 1,791,820 „ 71'67 2,500,000 „ 100% It is thus seen that the skin alone by evaporation of sweat and radiation accounts for 87 per cent of the total heat loss, a fact of the first importance in estimating its functions. Besides the secretion of sweat, there are other functions of the skin. Thus it removes a small amount of carbonic acid, up to \ ounce, and so may be classed with the lungs as a respi- ratory organ. The oxygen absorbed by the skin is, however, only "yi^ of that by the lung, and the carbonic acid even less. In frogs, on the other hand, the proportions are quite reversed, and in them from § to \ of the total carbonic acid are elimi- nated by the skin. A slight amount of absorption goes on by the skin. Owing to its oily covering, water and water solutions are not absorbed, but ointments may be rubbed into the skin to attain that end. If the epidermis be rubbed off, so as to expose a raw surface, absorption is rapid, and this is a fertile source of blood-poisoning from wounds. Absorption is still more rapid when a substance

FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 108 5. Exchange of products is thus due as much to vital and chemical action as to diffusion of gases. 6. Expired air has lost oxygen, gained carbonic acid and water, and has been warmed to nearly blood-heat. 7. The amount of carbonic acid evolved, and therefore of oxygen used, is greatly increased by exercise and by carbonaceous food, and generally by increased chemical activity in the body. Lesson 21.—THE KIDNEYS AND URINE. Not only do the lungs serve to oxygenate the blood, but they also serve as excretory organs, removing from the body two waste products especially, carbonic acid and water, the former from the combustion of carbon, the latter from that of hydrogen. Besides the liver and bowels, the other organs concerned in the removal of waste are the kidneys and the skin, both engaged in the re- moval of water and salts as urine or sweat, and nitrogenous waste, with the removal of which last the lungs have noth- ing to do except for the small amount of organic matter wrhich passes off in the breath. The mechanism for the excre- tion of urine comprises the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The Kidneys, called of old " the reins ", are two in number, situated on either side of the backbone high up in the loins, and covered by masses of fat. In man they are about 4 inches by 2£, and present the characteristic kidney shape, but are smooth on the siuface, not lobulated like those of the ox. Each kidney is covered by a capsule or skin, and this passes on to cover the ureter or collecting tube. These leave the kidneys at the inner hollow, and into the same place pass the blood-vessels, renal arteries, and Fig-. 28.—A Kiduey opened in its length.

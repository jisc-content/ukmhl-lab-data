THE KIDNEYS AND URINE. 109 veins, very large for the size of the kidney. When cut open the kidney is seen to be a tubular gland composed of numerous urinary tubules about inch in diameter, running more or less directly from the capsule to the centre, where they are caught up into groups or pyramids as shown on page 108, On the right-hand side 1 points to the dilated end of a tubule (in the cortex) containing a tuft of blood-vessels. The tubule passeB off as the convoluted tubule (2), then it suddenly becomes straight (3) and passes clown to the medullary re- fion, turning back at 4 and passing ack (5) to toe cortex, where it be- comes wavy (6), and ultimatelyjoins a straight tubule 7, running down- wards (8,8) through the medulla to open at 9 on the apex of a pyramid into the pelvis of the kidney (see fig. 28). On the left-hand side of the "fig. the relation of tubule and vessels is shown: ar is a branch of the renal artery, from which a twig (a) passes off to enter the dilated end of a tubule; e points to the vessel leaving the tubule and breaking in- to a meshwork of capillaries, which finally form again into one vessel, joining a branch of the renal vein (V). The artery is shown giving off other twigs to other tubules. At the side, C indicates the cortical re- gion, M the medullary region, and B the layer boucding the two.

These tubules are very compli- cated in structure, and are supplied with blood after the fashion of the portal system. Each tubule originates near the outer surface in a hollow cap or ball, called a Malpighian body, which receives a little blood-vessel from the renal artery. Within this ball the vessel breaks up into loops of capillaries which reunite as usual to form a vein; but instead of proceeding

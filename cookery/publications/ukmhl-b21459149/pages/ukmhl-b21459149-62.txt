FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 50 "If of swallowing is divisible into throe stages: a voluntary stage, in which the food is carried by the tongue to the back of the mouth; a spasmodic stage, when the food gets just beyond control, marked by the closing of the windpipe; and an involuntary stage, during which the bolus is grasped by the muscles at the back of the throat and shot down the gullet into the stomach, while ar- rangements are made to keep it from going any other way. The gullet, or oesophagus, is nearly 10 inches long, and' con- sists of a muscular tube lined with mucous membrane. It is usually closed, but is dilated in swallowing, and the bolus of food is forced down by muscular action, the pas- sage occupying only aboutj-^ second. After the food has reached the stomach the gullet again closes to prevent its return. That the down- ward passage of the food is due to muscular action and not to gravity is well seen by watching a horse drinking; the successive mouth- fuls of water are seen passing up the animal's gullet. Jugglers, also, have no difficulty in swallowing standing on their heads. SUMMARY. 1. Digestion comprises several pro- cesses, mechanical and chemical. 2. Digestion begins in the mouth, by the conversion of starch into dextrin and maltose by the action of saliva. 3. The salivary glands consist of three pairs—parotid, sub-maxillary, and sub-lingual. 4. The active ingredient in saliva is ptyalin, a soluble fermeut. 5. Ptyalin is not fully developed in infants before the age of eight months or so.

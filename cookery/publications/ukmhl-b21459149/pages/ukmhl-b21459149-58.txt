52 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. SUMMARY. 1. Water occurs in all tissues, constituting two-thirds of the body. 2. It also occurs in all foods, to the extent of one-half or more. 3. Water is a tissue-former as well as a digestive solvent. 4. Hardness in water is due to compounds of lime or magnesia. 5. When hardness is due to carbonates, it is temporary, and can be removed by boiling the water or adding lime. 6. Hardness due to sulphates of lime, &c, is permanent. Part III.—PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. Lesson 11.— PEOCESSES IN THE MOUTH. As has been seen in preceding lessons, the body demands, both for its own support and for the liberation of energy, supply of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, along with smaller quantities of other elements. With the exception of oxygen, obtained directly from air, these elements are not presented to the body as such, but in those combinations, such as albumen, fat, starch, sugar, &c, called proximate principles. The union of elements to form these principles is already effected for us by plants, and now comes in the process of digestion, by which the organic materials supplied by plants are converted into a liquid.form, with the view of being assimilated or formed into our own flesh and blood. This is the standing miracle which Life presents in even its lowest forms; the transformation of dead matter, either at first or second hand, with living tissue. The digestive processes have for aim the solution of the several food-stuffs, and this is assisted, not merely by the water contained in all food-stuffs, and taken along with them as beverages, but by various digestive juices prepared within the organism itself, and exercising a chemico-viial action. It is usual to distinguish in digestion the following stages:— 5. Intestinal digestion, 1. Mastication, 2. Insalivation, 3. Swallowing, 4. Gastric digestion, or Chymification, 6. Absorption, and 7. Defaecation.

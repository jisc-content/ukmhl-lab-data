WATER. 47 This explains the curious fact that more water is removed from the body than is consumed in the food and drink. An adult uses daily in solid and liquid food from 70 to 90 ounces of water, or about 4 pints, whereas there is removed from the body by the lungs, skin, kidneys, and bowels more than ih pints, the excess having been formed by oxidation within the system. Water is required for two reasons ; as a solvent, to aid in digestion, and for purposes of tissue-formation. Roughly speaking, about two-thirds of the whole body consists of water; it enters into the composition of every tissue—even such a hard substance as the enamel of the teeth containing a small amount, Avhile saliva and sweat are almost entirely water. The amount of water in various tissues of the body is given by the following table in parts per 1000:— Solids. Liquids. Enamel, - 2 Dentine, - 100 Bone, - - 486 Fat, - - 299 Cartilage, - 550 Liver, - 693 Skin, - - 720 Brain, - 750 Muscle, - 757 Spleen, - 758 Connective, - 790 Kidney, - 827 Vitreou3 hu- mour, - 987 Blood, - - 791 Bile, - - 864 Milk, - - 891 Blood plasma, 901 Chyle, - - 928 Lymph, - 958 Serum, - - 959 Gastric juice, 973 Intestinal do. 975 Tears, - - 982 Saliva, - - 995 Sweat, - - 995 The human body is constantly undergoing tissue change. Worn-out particles are cast aside from- the system, while the new are ever being formed. Water has the power of increas- ing these tissue changes, which multiply the waste products, but at the same time they are renewed by its agency, giving rise to increased appetite, which in turn provides fresh nutri- ment. Persons but little accustomed to drink water are liable to have the waste products formed faster than they are removed. Any obstruction to the free working of natural laws at once produces disease, which, if once firmly seated, requires both time and money to cure. People accustomed to rising in the morning weak and languid will find the cause in the imperfect secretion of wastes, which many times may be remedied by drinking a full tumbler of water before retiring. This very materially assists in the process during the night, and leaves the tissue fresh and strong, and ready for the active work of the day. Hot water is one of the best remedial agents. A hot bath on going to bed, even in the hot nights of summer, is a better reliever of sleeplessness than many drugs. Inflated parts will subside under the continual poulticing of real hot water. Very hot water is a prompt checker of bleeding, and,

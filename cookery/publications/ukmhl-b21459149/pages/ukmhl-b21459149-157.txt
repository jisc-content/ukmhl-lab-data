147 ANIMAL FOOD. Of till animal foods Beef stands first, both in point of con- sumption and in respect of nutritive qualities. It is at its best when got from an ox four or five years old, and besides being affected by the factors already mentioned, varies in quality according to the part of the animal used. The best parts are the rump, sirloin, and fore-ribs; buttock, mid-ribs, and part of the shoulder; then the flank, certain parts of the shoulder, and brisket; lastly, the cheek, neck, and shin. Ox-fat is softer than mutton-fat, because it contains more olein, the olein amounting to one-third of the combined stearin and palmitin. Its melting-point is low, 41-50° C.

Its fibres are softer, rendering it easier of digestion by invalids. As a food, it is deficient in fat, but this is generally rectified by serving it with ham or similar fatty foods. The British practice of killing veal is reprehensible upon two grounds: the calves are killed too young to begin with, and the exhaustive bleeding deprives the flesh of a good deal of the salts in the blood, which have thus to be replaced in cooking by the use of gravy or extracts of meat. " Prepared " veal, as given in the Munich hospitals, where dietetics is reduced to an exact science, is veal minced and cooked with oatmeal. This supplies not only the necessary fat, but also a quantity of carbohydrates, and so forms an all-round food.

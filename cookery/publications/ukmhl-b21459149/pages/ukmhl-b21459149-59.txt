PROCESSES IN THE MOUTH. 53 On entering the mouth, the food, if solid, comes under the action of the teeth, by which it is cut, torn, and bruised by a purely mechanical action, while all the time it is being moist- ened by the mucus of the mouth, and thoroughly mixed with saliva, which exercises upon it a certain chemical action. Mastication and insalivation thus go on together, and the person who " bolts" his food is not only ignoring the presence of teeth, and thrusting a crude mass upon the sto- mach, thus degrading it to a mere crop or gizzard, but is depriving himself of a stage in digestion, and storing up gastric trouble. In the adult there are 32 Teeth, which have different shapes correspond- ing to their different functions. They are symmetrically arranged on either side of the middle line, and, from front to back, lie as follows:—2 incisors or cutting-teeth, chisel-shaped; 1 eye-tooth or canine, pointed, and adapted for tear- ing tough matters; 2 bicuspids, which get their name from their double crown; and 3 molars or grinders, the last gener- ally known as " wisdom teeth ". This relationship of the teeth is expressed by the dental formula— = 32. . 4.—Structure of Tooth (magnified). M.

From that time onwards the milk-teeth get gradually displaced by the permanent teeth, and their roots^become absorbed. A single tooth presents to the eye three distinct parts. The visible part is the crown, and it is covered with enamel (a), the hardest substance in the body, containing only 2 parts per 1000 of solids. The neck of the tooth is distinguished from

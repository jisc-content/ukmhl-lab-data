FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 130 pings", or "afterings", is very marked. Fraudulent dairymen, with no higher fear than that of an inspector, have been known to carry "strippings", known as "fear" milk, so as to supply that functionary on demand, and Professor Blyth tells how an unscrupulous farmer may try to damage an analyst's reputation by submitting for analysis "fore" milk drawn off before witnesses. The analysis of such a milk would, of course, show a low percentage of fat, and the effect would be to lower the standard of purity in the minds of the local authorities. The minimum insisted on by the S.P.A. is 8-5 percent of solids not fat, and not less than 3 per cent of fat, but in good milk 4 per cent of fat should be looked for. Professor Blyth gives the following comparative analyses of "fore" milk and "strip- pings":— Specific gravity, ■■• Milk-fat,... " ... Casein, Albumen, Peptones,... Lactose, ...

This would give the body far too much water, while fats and proteids would also be in excess; hence in order to redress the balance carbohydrates are needed, and these are generally supplied in the form of bread, rice, or other starchy foods. The question is often asked, What should a nursing mother take to improve her milk? At first sight it would seem that a fatty diet would be required to increase the proportion of butter in the milk, but this is so far from being the case that increase of fat in the food rather diminishes the amount of fat in the milk. Sugary diets have no marked effect, as milk- sugar appears to be derived from proteids, and not from

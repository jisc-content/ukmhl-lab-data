FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 112 lime-water penetrates at first and makes the albumen more fluid, giving also a peculiar taste to the egg. The method of desiccation has been tried, but as yet has not been very successful; the yolk especially is difficult to keep. It is said that desiccated eggs will keep if ground up with flour, ground rice, or other farinaceous material; and since eggs are deficient in carbohydrates, this would seem to be a good way of adjust- ing the balance. From the land of the wooden nutmeg there comes the artificial egg, for which, however, something may be claimed as a food. They are built up in sections, beginning with the yolk, to make which butter and albumen are mixed in proper proportions and coloured with annatto, then whirled to give the necessary ovoid form. The mass is then frozen and coated with fine gelatin to imitate the limiting membrane, as well as to retain the yolk in shape; then it is coated with a solution of albumen in water till the proper thickness is attained, when it is again rotated, frozen, and coated with gelatin. The whole is coated with sulphate, not carbonate, of lime to form the shell, thicker than a natural shell and non-porous. They are said to be very nutritious (?) and keep for years.

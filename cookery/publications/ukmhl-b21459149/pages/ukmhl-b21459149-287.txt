The multitudinous soups of French cookery books have all been reduced by Sir Henry Thompson to five classes, as fol- lows :— 1. A clear soup from ordinary beef, veal, sometimes mutton and pork in the form of ham or bacon, either in the weak or broth form, or as consomme. 2. A clear soup from fowl. 3. A clear soup from game. 4. A clear soup from fish proper and with shell-fish, includ- ing bisques, i.e. purees of cray-fish. 5. A clear soup from vegetables only, comprising herbs, roots, grains, and farinaceous substances. A soup may be thickened by the addition of gelatinous mat- ters, by farinaceous substances, or by animal and vegetable purges; thus, a meat consomme may be enriched by a puree of fowl, or of potatoes and herbs, &c. &c. SUMMAKY. 1. Cooking exercises both mechanical and chemical effect upon food. 2. All methods are reduced to two classes, depending on whether the meat juices are to be retained or extracted. 3. In roasting and other methods of the first class, the juices are retained by preliminary case-hardening by intense heat, after which cooking proceeds at a lower temperature, rising in the interior to the coagulating point of albumen. 4. Stewing first extracts the juice and then cooks the meat in it, and is thus conducted slowly and over a long time. 5. Soup-making aims at extracting as much as possible, and there- fore begins in the cold, never rising above 73° C.

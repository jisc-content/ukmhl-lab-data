104 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. a supporting framework is highly elastic, and this elasticity- comes into play in breathing. Like the heart, the lungs are enclosed in a double sac known as the pleum, the outer layer being attached to the chest wall, and the inner to the surface of the lung. The other parts concerned in ordinary breathing are the ribs, with the inter- costal muscles lying between them, and the vaulted floor of the chest called the diaphragm or midriff. The intercostal muscles are so arranged that, when they contract, the upper and middle ribs are raised, and the chest expands forwards and upwards, as may be seen in women, in whom breathing is chiefly " costal ", carried on by the ribs. In men, on the other hand, breathing is. effected chiefly by the diaphragm, which in contracting pulls down the floor of the chest and the lower ribs, displacing the abdominal organs, whence this type of breathing is called " abdominal" breathing. By the joint action of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm the chest is expanded at regular intervals, 15 to 20 per minute, and the A P A, The lungs pulled aside in front to bIiow the heart, B, and the bronchi, G, G; C, the aorta; D, the pul- monary artery; E, the superior vena cava, formed by the junc- tion of the reins (subclavian) from the right and left sides, K, K; F, the wind- pipe; I, I, veins from the head and neck (jugular) joining K, K; H, H, arteries (carotid) to head and neck; J, J, arteries (subclavian) passing to right and left sides; P, P, ribs; Q, left coronary artery; K, right auricle.

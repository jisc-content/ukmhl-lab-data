MILK DERIVATIVES. BUTTER. 131 carbohydrates at all, so that the common practice of taking stout and similar beverages is a mistake. These increase the milk, but only in respect of quantity, the result being the same as if the milk had been watered. It is found that the diet best calculated to improve the quality of the milk is a rich one, i.e. a proteid diet with a small amount of vegetables. Not only is the quantity of milk increased, the casein, sugar, and fat are also increased. The casein in the milk is formed by the milk-glands out of materials supplied to them by blood and lymph; these glands are paralysed by atropin (belladonna). The mental and physical state of the mother powerfully affect the composition of her milk, and infants have even been dosed with "medicated" milk, for certain medicines administered to the mother, such as chloral, rhubarb, opium, &c, pass into the milk, and so affect the child. SUMMAEY. 1. Milk is a complete food, i.e. containing the proportion of all the proximate principles required for young mammals. 2. Its chief solid constituents are casein, lactose, and butter, about 4 per cent of each. 3. Milk is deficient in carbohydrates, and has to be supplemented by bread or other farinaceous foods. 4. It contains only 2£ ozs. of solids to the pint, and is therefore unsuited for an adult, who would have to take 9 pints daily. 5. Human milk differs from cow's milk in being poorer in every- thing except sugar. Lesson 25.—MILK DERIVATIVES. BUTTER. Besides cream and skim-milk there are obtained from milk butter and cheese, including the bye-products butter-milk and whey.

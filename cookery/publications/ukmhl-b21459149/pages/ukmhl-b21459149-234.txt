FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 224 If any alcoholic liquor produced by fermentation, say beer or natural wine, be exposed to the air, further oxidation takes place, as described in lesson 37, and first aldehyd and then vinegar is formed under the influence of the acetic-acid bacillus. The successive changes may be represented chemi- cally thus:— C2HcO + O = C2H40 + H, O alcohol and oxygen form aldehyd and water. CaH40 + O = C2H402 aldehyd and oxygen form acetic acid. The first effect of the oxidation is to remove the equivalent of hydrogen required to form water, hence the name Aldehyd, i.e. ^4/cohol de Ay^rogenated. This substance is very intoxi- cating, and is invariably produced in new wine, hence the allusion in Acts ii. 13. As the equations above show, it is easily oxidized in turn, producing acetic acid, so that there is a regular chain of substances all connected by the different transformations as follows: — Starch — sugar (cane - sugar, maltose)—glucose—alcohol—aldehyd—acetic acid. The word vinegar means sour wine, and the Germans call acetic acid Weinsaiire. Alcoholic beverages are commonly classed as spirits, wines, and beers, the last two being fermented liquors, the first pro- ducts of distillation. Parkes gives the following comparison of spirits:— Spirit. Alcohol. Solids. Ash. Acidity per ounce (as Tartaric Acid). Sugar. Brandy, .... Gin, Whisky,.... 45 to 55% 49 to 57 50 to 55 50 to 60 1-2 1-2 0-6 TO •05 to -2 •1 trace •1 1 grain. •2 •2 •5 0 or traces. 1 0 0 Spirits are now simply flavoured alcohol, and consist of ethyl alcohol, ethers derived from this in the process of "mellowing", water, and certain colouring and flavouring substances. The leading European spirits are brandy, whisky, nun, and gin, all obtained by distillation from fermented saccharine liquids as already described. Brandy (German, Branntwein, distilled wine), Cognac or Eau-de-vie, is, or perhaps it would be more correct to say was,

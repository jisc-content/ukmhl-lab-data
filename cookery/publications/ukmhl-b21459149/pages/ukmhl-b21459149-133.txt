123 MILK. Part IV.—FOODS IN DETAIL. Lesson 24.—MILK. Among animal foods there are two provided by nature for the support of the young—milk and eggs. These are some- times called complete or perfect foods, because they contain in the proper proportion all the materials for the upkeep of those for whom they are intended, the young mammal and embryo chick respectively. Although milk is admirably adapted for infancy—and an invalid has often to return to infantile diet,— still it is far too deficient in carbohydrates to be proper food for adults. The analysis of average cow's milk shows the following composition:— Water, 82-90 per cent; average 87 "5 per cent. Solids, 18-10 ; not less than 12 in good milk. Solids not fat, up to 11; 8-5 is the minimum standard of the Proteids, 3-5. Fats, not less than 3; 4 in good milk. Sugar (Lactose), 5. Ash, 0-6. Milk has a characteristic odour, and shows in human milk an alkaline reaction. The milk of carnivora is always acid from the presence of lactic acid, while cow's milk may be alkaline, neutral, or acid. They all become acid on standing, owing to the formation of lactic acid, and at the same time oxygen is absorbed and carbonic acid evolved. The specific gravity of milk, as tested by the lactometer, varies from 1026 to 1035. The lacto- meter, as shown in the figure, is a glass bulb weighted below with mercury to make it float upright, and having a long graduated stem. The denser the milk the greater its buoyancy, and the stem is well out of the liquid, while in water the stem should sink to the mark 0, indicating 1000. Since butter is lighter than water the effect of skimming the milk is to rJ2&Sta. raise the specific gravity of the milk, since skim- milk is proportionally heavier than whole milk; and if now water be added, the specific gravity will be lowered to its S.P.A. a

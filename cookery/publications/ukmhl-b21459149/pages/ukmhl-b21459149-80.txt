74 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. presents many examples of diffusion through porous mem- brane. For the porous partition let there now be used a piece of animal membrane, or non-porous parchment paper, such as is used for covering preserves; diffusion currents will again be set up through the mem- brane, tending to produce average den- sity in the liquids employed. Diffu- sion through non-porous walls is called Osmosis, and the inward and outward currents are distinguished by the terms endosmosis and exosmosis, al- though there is always a double cur- rent. By the arrangement shown in the figure it is easy to measure the rate of diffusion. The vessel v has a bottom of animal membrane- and is filled with brine, then immersed in another vessel a b containing water. As water passes into v faster than brine passes out, the contents of n will rise in the graduated tube. Such an appa- ratus is called an endosmometer, and by its means the rates of diffusion or "endosmotic equivalents" of various substances have been determined, among them the following:— Fig. 13.—Endosmometer. Potassium bisulphate, Sodium chloride (salt), Sugar, Sodium sulphate, ... Magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts), 2-3 4-3 7-1 116 117 Potassium sulphate, 12-0 Sulphuric acid, ... 0-39 Caustic potash, ... 215*0 Peptone (2 to 9 %), 7 to 10 Albumen, 100 This means that 4-3 parts of water will pass in one direction while one part of salt is passing the other way, and it will be seen that while salts, sugar, and peptone are fairly diffusible, albumen diffuses with great difficulty, no fewer than 100 parts of water passing for every 1 of albumen in the reverse direction. This explains the necessity for its conversion into peptone, and also the fact that the contents of the small intestine are as fluid at the ileo-csecal valve as in the duo- denum.

PREFACE. Although the preparation of food is one of the oldest of the arts, Cookery as an applied science is still in its infancy, and only within recent years have any serious attempts been made to place diet and dietetics upon a proper scientific foundation. Based as it is upon physi- ology and chemistry, it is impossible to secure the rational treatment of food without at least a slight acquaintance with food-stuff's in general, with the chemical and other changes induced by cooking, and above all, with the subsequent course of the food within the body itself. In spite of the activity of the Science and Art Department and kindred bodies, it is to be feared that popular instruc- tion in the sciences in question has reached only one sex, and that the one less concerned with food preparation, and of the majority of us it may still be said without slander that we are concerned not so much with the history of the last meal as with the prospects of the next. More liberal views of education, however, are now prevailing, and no teacher of cookery can secure a first-class diploma without some knowledge of the chemistry of foods and the digestive processes, while the code for evening con- tinuation schools liberally encourages the popular teach- ing of such subjects. The present volume is an expansion of the course of lectures on dietetics which the author has been privileged to deliver to the students in training at the Glasgow Schools of Cookery, and it aims at supplying such

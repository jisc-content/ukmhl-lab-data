Asparagus is a vegetable of long standing as a delicacy, being mentioned as early as 425 B.C., and held in high esteem by the Romans. The green asparagus is the best variety, and it grows to perfection among the vines in Germany and France. The seeds are sometimes used on the Continent instead of coffee.

It consists of white crystals, soluble in hot water, alcohol, and ether, and is a derivative of benzene [C0H0], having the constitution C6H4 <g§> NH. It is 300 times sweeter than sugar, and one part in 10,000 of water is perceptible to the taste. Its taste resembles sugar but with a peculiar flavour, and it is to be looked for in all sweet manufactured liquids, such as liqueurs, lemonade, &c, where it is often added to sugar to save the latter. It is also employed in jam-making, because cane-sugar sets up fermen- tation with the germs of the skins, and this action has to be annulled either by using excess of cane-sugar or by employing a higher temperature than usual; and both of these remedies injure the flavour of the jam. With saccharin in the propor- tion of 1^ ounce to 4 gallons a temperature of only 180° F. is required. Sweetmeats may be said to consist of cane-sugar, grape- sugar, or honey, together with flavouring and colouring matters. Sugar alone will give all shades of colour from pure white through yellow, orange, and red to brown and black, but vegetable colours are often used, and even aniline dyes have not

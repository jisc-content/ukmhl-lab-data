FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 171 Lentils rank with haricot beans as the most nutritious of the Leguminosse. Their general composition is as under i— Water, 12-51 Proteids, 24'81 Fat 1-85 Carbohydrates, ... 5478 Cellulose, 3"58 Ash, 2-47 They are thus richer than peas or beans in nitrogenous sub- stances; their ash is richer in phosphates, potash, soda, and lime, and contains 2 per cent of iron oxide. They contain no sulphur, and are therefore not open to the objection of causing flatulence; indeed, lentils mixed with peas in making pea-soup greatly diminish that tendency. Lentils themselves make ex- cellent soup, but like all legumes they need to be steeped in water twelve hours or so before boiling. They are sold as split lentils, and also as lentil flour. There is a preparation greatly advertised as food for dyspeptic patients, RevalentaArabica, consisting of lentil flour, with either pea, bean, or maize meal, and a little oat or barkryvmeal, hi together in an oven. Beneke's flour for cancer cases consists of lentil flour, with rye flour added to increase the amount of starch. SUMMARY. 1. Legumes are quite equal to meat in respect of proteids, but contain much indigestible matter, and their proteid, legumin, is not so assimilable as albumen. 2. Haricot beans are the most nutritious and palatable form of legumes. 3. Lentils are distinguished from peas and beans by absence of sulphur. Lesson 33.—ROOTS AND TUBERS. The roots and tubers used for food comprise the various kinds of potato, yam, Jerusalem artichoke, with the different plants yielding arrowroot and tapioca, among which may be reckoned sago. The type of all these is the Potato, which, as will be seen from the appended analysis, consists to the extent of 95 per cent of water and starch. Their proteid matter is exceedingly

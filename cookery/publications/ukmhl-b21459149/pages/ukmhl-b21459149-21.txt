OXYGEN AND COMBUSTION. 15 up with oxygen it becomes bright scarlet, showing that the crimson colouring matter of the blood has taken up oxygen, or has been oxidized, forming a scarlet compound, lhis very oxidation takes place within the body, and accounts for the bright scarlet appearance of arterial as opposed to venous bl°Since oxygen is continually being removed from the air by the action of animals and fires, there might arise the question, "Why does not the oxygen become exhausted? bmce the nitrogen of the air is a purely passive gas, such a contingency would have the dire consequence of extinguishing both lights and life To solve the mystery, one has only to watch the green leaves of some water-plant, or a leaf of mint in a tumbler full of water In presence of sunlight little bubbles of gas are seen to form on the surface of the leaf, and by and by they are disengaged and rise to the surface. When the gas thus pro- duced is tested by a glowing match it is found to be oxygen, so that green plants are all day long manufacturing oxygen gas, and in this respect their action is precisely the reverse of our own; we consume oxygen and give out carbonic acid gas, they take this waste product and decompose it, keeping the carbon and liberating the oxygen. Thus animal life is an oxidizing process; plant life is generally a reducing process, since the carbonic acid gas is deprived of some of its oxygen. Plants and animals thus keep up a continuous cycle of atmos- pheric regeneration, and every blade of grass in our city parks is contributing its quota to the supply of that somewhat costly commodity, fresh air. The following table, adapted from Faraday, will convey some idea of the important part which . oxygen plays in this world:— I Principles - J ) In Animal matters < Phosphate of Lime f > average f.

118 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. is introduced by a hypodermic syringe into the looser subcuta- neous tissue. The functions of the skin may be summed up as follows:— 1. The skin consists of two parts, an upper skin and the true skin. 2. The latter is an organ of touch, and is chiefly concerned with regulating the bodily temperature. 3. The bodily temperature is lowered by radiation and evaporation of sweat, and will be lowered in proportion to the amount of blood sent to the surface. 4. Conversely, if blood is sent from the skin to the more internal organs the body temperature rises. 5. Loss by the skin is due to sweat, sebum, scurf, and a small amount of urea and carbonic acid. Looking at the human body merely as a machine for the production of energy, we have seen that it requires fuel and air, both obtained from without. This fuel, which we call food, is presented to us not in the crude shape of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, &c, nor even as the proximate principles fat, albumen, starch, sugar, but as food-stuffs, each of which may contain representatives of all these principles, and withal be more appetizing in appearance. These are to be regarded as storehouses of energy, so much bottled sunlight like Stephen- son's coal, energy stored up in past days by plants and animals in the shape of formed tissues and the complex chemical com- pounds of animal and vegetable substances, all formed out of the simple inorganic materials by process of reduction. Now comes in man, and by the opposite chemical process, that of oxidation, breaks up these complex bodies into others simpler and simpler, until at last they have liberated well-nigh the last particle of energy stored in them, and have become again stable inorganic matter. Plants are thus constructive, animals destructive; plants roll the ball up-hill, animals send it down Regulation of temperature. Secretion of sweat. Secretion of sebum. Respiration. Absorption.

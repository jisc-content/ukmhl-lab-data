13G FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. Acarus domesticus, and maggots or " jumpers ", the larvae of the cheese-fly. There is occasionally produced in it a poisonous ptomaine, tyrotoxicon or cheese-poison, a substance also found in milk which has been kept for three or four months. Cheese may be classed as "hard" or "soft". The latter are produced at a low temperature with little pressure, and are mostly alkaline, while "hard" cheeses are acid at first, and demand higher temperature and pressure. Among common soft cheeses are English cream-cheese; Neufchatel; Brie, which decomposes rapidly and is made for immediate use; and Roquefort, which is made from ewe's milk, and which, like other cheeses of that kind, tends to sour and cause diarrhoea. Of hard cheeses there are several varieties, depending on local manufacture or on the proportions of milk employed. Stilton cheese is made from whole milk and cream; Cheddar and double Glo'ster from whole milk; single Glo'ster from whole milk and skim-milk, and therefore very rich in proteids, but apt to be hard, and consequently difficult to digest; American and Dunlop, mostly made from whole milk. To this class also belong Parmesan, Gruyere, Gorgonzola, and skim-milk cheeses, Dutch and others. The following analyses show the composition of representative cheeses (Parkes):â€” Cheese. Water.

In evidence before the select committee of the House of Com- mons on food adulteration, it was stated that in several places there was no sale for skim-milk during the summer, because of the abundant supply of whole milk. Producers of the former had thus to convert it into cheese, but as skim-milk cheese was too hard and coarse for the popular taste, oleo-margarine had to be introduced to render the article finer as well as to supply its deficiency of fat. This " oleo "-cheese is quite a wholesome article of food, though not so wholesome as whole-milk cheese,

OXYGEN AND COMBUSTION. L3 In order to examine this gas, which is of prime importance in the human economy, it will be better to prepare two gallons or so. The gas is readily supplied for lime-light purposes m steel cylinders, but if these should not be available a supply can easily be got by heating in a flask a table-spoonful of potassium chlorate mixed with about one-third of its weight of manganese dioxide. The flask is fitted with a delivery-tube which dips under water, as shown in the figure, and the gas may be collected in jars filled with water and inverted m a basin of water. This arrangement is called a "pneumatic trough", and may always be used for collecting gases which are nearly insoluble in water. When each jar is filled, it may Fig. 2.â€”Preparation of Oxygen. be covered with a glass plate and set aside; a little grease on the edge of the jar will prevent any escape of gas. A jar of oxygen, thus obtained, is to all appearance empty, since oxygen is colourless. If now a piece of charcoal is heated to redness, and while still glowing plunged into the gas, it breaks into brilliant combustion, and the jar becomes slightly warm, for heat is evolved in every case of direct chemical union. When the combustion is over, replace the cover, add lime- water and litmus solution, and shake up; the lime-water becomes milky from carbonic acid gas, and the litmus changes from blue to purplish-red, thus giving an explanation of the name carbonic acid gas. This experiment can be utilized as a test for oxygen, which reveals its presence by rekindling a glowing splinter of wood. If now a little lime-water be placed in a saucer and set aside for an hour or so, it will get faintly milky, showing that there

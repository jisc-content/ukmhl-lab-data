METABOLISM. 121 finally become somehoAv part of the blood. The heart propels them to all parts of the organism, bathing the tissues in lymph by exudation and supplying with both nutriment and oxygen, receiving in return their waste products and unused lymph by both the venous and lymphatic vessels. The glands and other organs concerned in digestion draw their raw material from the blood, and from it also the kidneys, &c, excrete various waste matters; while the lungs, in addition to removal of waste, supply the body with oxygen. The last and most important stage in the whole process is Assimilation. How do the tissues exercise their mysterious selective powers, and take from the blood only those things they require, and so out of these dead matters form living muscle, nerve, and so on? This takes us into the whole mystery of life, and the relation of soul (faxv) to body; and all 1 hat can be said to-day is that of the process of assimilation we know nothing at all. Certain it is that a person may have an enviable appetite, good digestion, perfect absorption, and un- impaired circulation, but his food gets no further than blood, the body is not benefited to anything like the proper extent, remaining thin and emaciated, and the blood so plentifully produced simply relieves its own pressure by escaping on the slightest provocation, as by bleeding at the nose. It is possible that this mysterious function may be connected with the nervous system, just as diabetes, a similar disturbance of assimilation, may be traced to disorder of the sympathetic nervous system, but in these matters the "personal ecpiation" bulks largely. "What is one man's meat is another man's poison", and so Macbeth's salutation receives an additional forceâ€” " Now good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both ". A very good bird's-eye view of the functions of the body is presented in the scheme from Prof. M'Kendrick's Outlines of Physiology, given on the following page.

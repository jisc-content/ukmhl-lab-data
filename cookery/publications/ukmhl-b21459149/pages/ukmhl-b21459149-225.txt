TEA, COFFEE, COCOA, ETC. 215 —and the coffee should be ground and used immediately after roasting, failing which there is always a loss of this aromatic oil, in spite of closed tins and other devices. Roasting further renders the berries light and porous, owing to the escape of gases, chiefly nitrogen and the oxides of carbon; this swells the berries, and so, though larger, they are light; ground coffee floats on water, while chicory sinks. The essential constituents of coffee are theine or caffeine, already described in connection with tea, caffeo-tannic acid, generally combined with potash, the peculiar volatile oil, and coffee-butter. The relative proportion of these is shown in the following tabular analyses (Blyth):— Sample. Gummy matters. Caffeine. Fat. Tannin anil Caffeo-tannio Acid. Cellulose. Ash.

The British are blamed for being the only civilized people in the world who cannot make coffee, and perhaps the false analogy of tea, for the preparation of which they are famous, has led them astray, for the error is twofold—too little coffee is used to begin with, giving a wishy-washy solution, and it is prepared by infusion like tea. To obtain the full strength of the coffee the example of the East should be followed, and the beverage prepared by infusion and decoction combined. This is effected by first making an infusion as with tea, but the grounds are boiled in more water, and this boiling fluid poured over a second por- tion of fresh coffee. Prepared in this way, coffee should yield fully one-third of its weight of extract, while the aroma is conserved as much as possible. Like tea, coffee is not a food, except for the milk and sugar added to it, and when coffee is prepared by using boiling milk instead of water, as in cafe au lait, its food value is, of course, considerable. Although the percentage of caffeine is less in

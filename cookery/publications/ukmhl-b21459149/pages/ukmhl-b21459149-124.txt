114 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. who are inclined to be sedentary, with plenty of muscular exercise, which greatly increases the consumption of sugar within the body. The "personal equation" in the matter of carbohydrates seems to be considerable; the ingestion of fruit- sugar (levulose) is not generally accompanied by the appear- ance of sugar in the urine, and the same is true of milk-sugar. The dietetic rules for such cases have been drawn up by Professor See as follows:— 1. Eeduce to a minimum, or abolish altogether, all sugar- forming foods. 2. Raise to the physiological maximum all flesh foods, i.e. give as much animal food as can be well digested and assimilated. 3. Replace the carbon of carbohydrates by the various animal and vegetable fats. 4. Promote muscular activity to consume the excess of sugar in the blood. SUMMARY. 1. The kidney is a compound tubular gland devoted to the removal of water, salts, and nitrogenous waste. 2. In removiug water it is assisted by the lungs, bowels, and skin, so that when these are active the amount of water removed by the kidneys is proportion ably less. 3. The total amount of solids removed in urine is actually greater than that removed by the bowels. 4. Nitrogenous waste takes the form of urea, uric acid, &c, and of the former there are excreted 500 grains per day. 5. Albumen and sugar are abnormal products in urine, the former indicating defective assimilation of proteids, the latter failure of liver action, due to liver or nervous disorder. Lesson 22.—THE SKIN. The other exit by which waste products pass out of the body is by the Skin, and in order to explain its functions its struc- ture demands attention. The skin consists of two parts, an epidermis, cuticle, scarf- skin or false skin (fig. 31, a) covering the dermis, chorium or true skin below. The upper skin is destitute of blood-vessels and nerves, as may be seen by inserting a needle under it, and

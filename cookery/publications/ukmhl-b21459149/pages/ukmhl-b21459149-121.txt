THE KIDNEYS AND URINE. Ill Another nitrogenous compound of importance is Uric Acid, and in animals with solid urine this occurs instead of urea. Accumulation of uric acid in the blood characterizes gout, and since urates are not very soluble, they tend to be deposited in the bladder, giving rise to gravel or stone. The use of lithia- water in gout is based upon the fact that urates of lithia are pretty soluble, and so have a better pro- spect of being re- moved in urine. Besides these sub- stances, urine con- tains hippuric acid; pigments derived, like those of bile and fseces, from the red corpuscles of blood; various extractives; and mucus from the bladder. Its specific gravityis aboutl020, but this is subject to large fluctua- tions. After copious draughts of water the urine becomes more watery, while after severe muscular exer- cise, accompanied by copious perspiration, the specific gravity may be high, since in that case most of the water has been removed by the skin and lungs. The urine first passed in the morning, "night-urine", is always denser than that at any other period of the day. The kidneys, lungs, and skin are all concerned in the excretion of water, though in man the kidneys excrete more than the lungs and skin together; but after violent exercise the proportions may be reversed, and the ratio of water excreted by skin and lungs to that excreted by the kidneys may rise from *5 or -8:1 up to 2 or 2J : 1.

Branches of the aorta are seen going to the kidney, and veins from it are shown joining the vena cava.

219 TEA, COFFEE, COCOA, ETC. In Dutch cocoa, typified by Van Houten's, the fat is not removed but rather saponified and so pre-digested, by soaking the cocoa-beans in water containing potash or soda. Ihe advantage of this process is seen in the fact that this cocoa may be prepared by simply adding boiling water or milk, whereas if a large amount of starch be present the cocoa must be boiled to dissolve this. Chocolate is cocoa specially prepared from the finest quality of cocoa-nibs and sugar, flavoured with aromatic substances, generally vanilla. The process may be seen in many a choco- latier's shop-window, and consists in crushing the cocoa-nibs in a mill under heated rollers. This process softens the cacao- batter, and this last forms with the sugar and flavouring a paste which is then pressed into moulds. A few trade recipes are appended:— French chocolate: 2 beans of vanilla rubbed into a powder with sugar, and 1 lb. of sugar to 3 of cocoa-nibs. Spanish chocolate: Curacoa cocoa 11, sugar 3, vanilla ^, cinnamon TT, cloves ^4-^. Spanish chocolate (another recipe): Caraccas cocoa 10, sweet almonds 1, sugar 3, vanilla JT. Vanilla chocolate: Caraccas cocoa 7, Mexican vanilla cinnamon ^ and cloves to flavour. Vanilla chocolate (another recipe): Chocolate paste 21, vanilla 4, cinna- mon cloves and musk.

171 LEGUMES. defect recognized in the popular combinations of beans and bacon, green peas and ham, boiled pork and pease-pudding, and the leguminous purees made, up with butter or lard, as in the Erbswurst or pea sausage of the German army. They are rather indigestible, containing as much as 6| per cent of insoluble matters, and hence are unsuitable for persons of sedentary occupations, except now and then to remedy con- stipation. For active open-air workers legumes will be found equal to meat in nutritive powers. On account of the absence of gluten they cannot be baked into bread, and their peculiar taste sometimes renders them objectionable. They dry very hard, and need to be thoroughly soaked, for twelve to twenty- four hours before cooking, in the softest water obtainable, after which they must be boiled gently in soft water, since the lime and magnesia found in hard waters form insoluble compounds with legumin.

The former is used in the pods for feeding cattle, while for human food they are shelled, split, and sold as split peas, or ground into pea-flour or pease-meal. The garden pea is eaten unripe, and in a still more immature state it is served up, pods and all, as haricots verts. The fresh ripe pea is sweetish, and should be cooked by simple boiling in water with a little salt; but when old they lose much wrater, becoming very hard and dry, lose their colour, and get much shrivelled, so that they must be steeped a long time in water in order to soften them; or, since boiling rather hardens them if very old, the French fashion may be adopted of stewing them gently in a little water with butter, a little salt, and flavourings to taste. In order to preserve the colour, which pales on keeping, copper is often added to green peas to the extent of 2 grs. per pound tin. "Whether such an addition is harmful is an open epiestion,

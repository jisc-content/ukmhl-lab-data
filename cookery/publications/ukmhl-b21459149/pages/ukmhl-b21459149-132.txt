Of the potential energy in food and oxygen the body can show $ as mechanical work, amounting to 300 foot-tons per day. 3. The greater the fuel properties of a food the more energy can be got out of it, fats in this respect being facile princeps. 4. Metabolism is the name given to the physiological changes con- cerned in the transformation of energy. 5. Assimilation is the process by which the living cells of the body take up the materials supplied to them by the blood. 6. Chemically speaking, the whole metabolic process is one of oxidation, and the food appears under the final forms of carbonic acid, water, urea and kindred substances, sulphates, phosphates, &c.

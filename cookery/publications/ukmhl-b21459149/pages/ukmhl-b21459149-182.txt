172 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. but there is good reason to believe that copper will for this purpose be displaced by chlorophyll, the natural green colour- ing matter of plants. Peas are not so nutritious as beans, since not only do they contain more indigestible matter, but are poorer in fat and proteids; pea-albumen differs from ordinary albumen both in composition and behaviour. Pea-flour does not keep very well, and putrefying peas form a poison of the ptomaine class. When hot water is added to bean or pea flour it gives off the peculiar bean odour. The following analyses will give some idea of the com- position of peas:— Peas. Peasc-ineal. Water, ...

In China and Japan another variety of pea is used in the form of cheese. It is very poor as a food-stuff, having fully 90 per cent of water, and containing only 2J per cent of fatty matters and less than 1 per cent of proteids. The Beans used for food in this country are chiefly the broad or Windsor bean, and the kidney or haricot bean, an

CARBOHYDRATES. STARCH. 35 3. They all contain a fatty acid and glycerine. 4. Soaps contain a fatty acid and soda or potash. 5. Both fat-splitting and soap-forming actions occur in digestion. 6. Adipose tissue consists of albuminous cells filled with fat. Lesson 7.—CARBOHYDRATES. STARCH. We now come to the great division of food-stuffs known as Carbohydrates. As the name implies, they consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the last two being in the proportion to form water; that is, the hydrogen may be regarded as already oxidized, leaving only the carbon available as a source of energy. Three subdivisions of this class are generally recog- nized, namely:— Sucroses. Cane-sugar. Lactose or milk-sugar. Maltose or sugar of malt. Glucoses. Dextrose or grape-sugar. Levulose or fruit-sugar. Amylases. Starch. Dextrin. Cellulose. Gums. Glycogen. Let us take, to begin with, the amyloses or Starches, of which ordinary starch will serve as the type. When freshly made it is a white powder, structureless to the eye, but seen under the microscope to consist of minute grains, oval or pear-shaped. Pig. 3.—A, Cells from Potato Tuher showing Starch Granules. B, Starch Grains of Potato more highly magnified. If a raw potato be cut in two, pared round the edges to avoid dirt, and the faces rubbed together with a little water, the latter will become milky. On examining a, drop of this under the microscope, the milkiness is seen to be due to the presence of innumerable ovoid bodies, with a faint onion-like structure. These are grains of potato starch, and they were inclosed

57 GASTRIC DIGESTION. 6. Tea arrests salivary digestion. 7. A booth consists, as fco appearance, of crown, neck, and fang ; and as to structure, of enamel, dentine, and cement. 8. The use of the teeth is purely mechanical, but necessary for com- plete insalivation, and to prepare food for the stomach. Lesson 12.—GASTRIC DIGESTION. The Stomach, which now receives the food from the gullet, is an oval muscular bag, of the shape shown in the diagram. The thick end lies below the heart, and is hence called the cardiac end (Greek kardia, the heart), while the narrow part, extending to the right beyond the middle line, is called the pyloric end, from a valve- like construction fanci- fully called the pylorus or gate. The organ thus presents a greater and a lesser curvature, the latter uppermost; and owing to contraction of the muscular walls, the food has two kinds of motion. There is a churn- ing motion, whereby the food is rotated along the d- greater cur vature towards the pyloric end, then back along the lesser curvature to the closed gullet open- ing. At the same time the stomach turns slightly outwards, presenting the greater curvature to the front, and thus causing a feeling of fulness. At intervals, especially towards the end of digestion, a wave-like motion occurs, by which the portion of food already digested is swept towards the pyloric valve, which opens to admit of its passage into the bowel. This is con- tinued till stomach digestion is completed; but if the organ be overworked its stock of energy becomes exhausted, and in that case the sensitiveness of the pyloric valve is lessened, and the valve permits the passage of matters only partly digested.

77 ABSORPTION. 2. Sugars, more slowly, mostly into blood-vessels. 3. Peptones, into blood-vessels, changed in passing into albumen. 4. Unchanged proteids diffuse with great difficulty, and in this case the vital activity of the epithelial cells comes into play. 5. Soluble soaps, representing a small part of the fatty food, into blood-vessels and lacteals, changed into fats again. 6. Neutral fats, into the lacteals. (b) Oil-globules, into the lacteals. Roughly speaking, fats alone pass into the lacteals to join the lymphatic system; all other food-stuffs pass into the blood- vessels, and are carried by the portal vein to the liver for further treatment. The bearing of all this upon nutrient enemata is obvious. Since the small intestine is the chief seat of absorption, it is desirable in administering an enema to encourage the contents to pass the ileo-colic valve, so as to enter the small intestine; and in order to effect this the enema should be just about blood-heat, so as not to stimulate the bowel wall and set up peristalsis; and it should be administered slowly to the patient in the recumbent position or on the left side, so that its passage from colon to small intestine may be facilitated as much as possible. About one-fourth of proteid matter thus injected can be absorbed. SUMMAEY. 1. To pass into the blood food must be rendered soluble and diffusible. 2. The forces in diffusion are partly mechanicalâ€”capillary attrac- tion, filtration under pressure, osmosis; partly vital. 3. By their vital action the cells of the bowel wall absorb oil-glo- bules, and reconvert peptones and soaps into albumen and fats respectively. 4. Diffusible matters leave the bowel by two different routes: by the blood-vessels and so to the liver, or by the lacteals into the lym- phatic system. 5. Fats alone go by the lacteals; all other foods by the blood- vessels. 0. The small intestine is the great seat of absorptive activity, next to it the large intestine, then the stomach.

103 RESPIRATION. from clogging the finer tubes they are all furnished with ciliated cells, i.e. cells provided on their free surfaces with minute hair-like structures, which by a kind of lashing motion cause a current towards the mouth. This ciliated epithelium is found in the windpipe and bronchial tubes, but not in the air-cells; and the effect of this motion is to sweep out in a stream of mucus any foreign particles, such as dust, which have found entrance into the lungs. When a bronchial tube is traced to its termination it is found to expand into a compound pouch, like a bunch of Fig. 26.â€”Air-cells of the Lung. grapes. This is an Infundibulum or air-cell, and here the walls are so thin as to offer no resistance to the passage of gases from the cell to the very elaborate meshwork of capillaries outside, and vice versa. The surface of the air-cells has been reckoned at about 100 times that of the entire surface of the body. The foregoing structures make up the structure of the Lungs. These are two in number, right and left, the right lung having three lobes and the left only two, owing to the greater space taken up on that side by the heart. They receive blood for their own nourishment by the bronchial arteries, and that blood returns to the right side of the heart in the usual way by the bronchial veins; but they also receive from the right ventricle the two large pulmonary arteries conveying impure blood, and they return that blood when aerated to the left auricle by the pulmonary veins. There is here, therefore, an instance of an artery conveying " venous " blood, and vice versa. The connective tissue surrounding the air-cells and forming

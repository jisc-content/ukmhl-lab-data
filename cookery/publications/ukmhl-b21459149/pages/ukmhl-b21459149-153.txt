143 ANIMAL FOOD. powders, consisting of starch and baking-soda, and the " light- ness" they confer is due to the disengagement of carbonic acid gas from the baking-soda. The table on p. 142, compiled from various analyses in Food and Sanitation, shows at a glance the misleading nature of the names given to these articles. As the comparison with a hen's egg shows, to call these " egg- powders " is simply an abuse of terms, if not worse. An egg- contains fully 22 per cent of albuminous matter, while the best of these mixtures contains no more than 6 per cent, and even in this the albumen is mostly of vegetable origin. Judged by this standard, instead of one packet being equivalent to four eggs, as is claimed, it would require seven ounce-packets of "Model" egg-powder, or twenty-five |-ounce packets of Borwick's baking-powder. Horsford's, an American preparation, is a good baking-powder, and is sold as such; it differs from the usual domestic combination in substituting phosphoric for tartaric acid, and is thus rich in salts, while the amount of carbonic acid gas for "raising" purposes is considerable. SUMMARY. 1. Eggs form a perfect food for an embryo chick, and for this purpose the shell is partly utilized. 2. White of egg is albumen and water; yolk contains also fats, as well as sulphur, iron, and phosphorus. 3. Eggs are thus deficient in carbohydrates and salts, deficiencies generally supplied by other articles. 4. Decomposition of eggs is due to the entrance of germs from the air, and may be arrested by closing the pores of the shell in any way. 5. " Egg-powders " are, for the most part, simply baking-powders, entirely innocent of egg substances. Lesson 28.â€”ANIMAL FOOD. The term "animal food" is popularly used to denote the flesh of animals used as food, since even vegetarians permit the use of eggs and milk. Animal flesh is muscle, with the several tissues accompanying it, such as connective tissue, fat, and the nerves and blood-vessels supplying the muscle. It

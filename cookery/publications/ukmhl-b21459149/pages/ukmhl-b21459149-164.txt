The addition of vinegar to the water has a good effect, not only converting the proteid matter into acid-all mmen, but dissolving many of the small bones. This is well seen in the use of potted herring, when the small bones may be completely dissolved, and the whole fish almost thus utilized as food. They may also be baked, but frying in the dry way is the most objectionable method, since the flesh is rendered more indigestible; fried skin should not be eaten except by those whose digestion is good.

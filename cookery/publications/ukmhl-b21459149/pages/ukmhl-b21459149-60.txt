FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 54 the fang, or root, which lies below the gum. The body of the tooth is composed of dentine (b), a substance resembling bone, but much harder, containing only 10 per 1000 of solids, while the fang is fixed into the jaw-bone (e) by a substance called the cement (c), practically the same as bone. The teeth are hollow, inclosing a space (/) filled with what is popularly called the "nerve", in reality a packing of pulpy tissue, con- taining, in addition to a twig of nerve, blood-vessels for the nourishment of the tooth. Very often there is formed on the teeth a deposit of "tartar", really carbonate of lime from the food, precipitated on the teeth much in the same way as fur is formed on a boiler. The teeth are attacked by mineral acids, and also by lactic acid, formed by fermenta- tion out of milk-sugar, and when once an opening has been made in the enamel or the underlying den- tine, the way is open for the ravages of caries. When salts of iron and similar tooth- solvents have to be taken medicinally they should be sucked through a tube, and the tooth-brush should be used after all meals. While the mass of solid food is thus coming under the action of the teeth, it is at the same time getting thoroughly mixed with mucus from the mucous glands of the mouth, and Saliva from the salivary glands. The action of mucus is purely mechanical, serving to moisten the mass and lubricate it as a preparation for swallowing. More important is the action of saliva, since it is a digestive agent, converting starch into dex- trin and malt-sugar. Saliva is supplied from three pairs of salivary glands. The largest of these is the parotid gland, placed, as its name implies, below its ear, and about the same size as that organ. It pours its contents into the roof of the mouth at the second molar tooth. The sub-maxillary (Lat. Fig. 5.â€”Salivary Glands, o, Parotid; 6, submaxillary; c, sublingual.

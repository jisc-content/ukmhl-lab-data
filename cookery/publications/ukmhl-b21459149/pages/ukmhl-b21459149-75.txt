THE LARGE INTESTINE. G9 7. Intestinal juice inverts sugar and also acts on proteids. 8. Bile assists in saponifying and emulsifying fats, besides stiiuu- lating the bowel and arresting putrefaction. 9. By intestinal digestion proteids are converted into peptones and other products, starches into dextrose, sugars also into dextrose, and fats into emulsions and soaps. Lesson 14.—THE LAKGE INTESTINE. When food has been in the small intestine for about three hours it passes into the Large Intestine or colon. At the place where the ileum enters the colon the walls of the former are prolonged so as to form a two-lipped fold or valve, the ileo - colic valve, so arranged as to permit a passage to- wards the colon, but not in the reverse direction. The large intestine is about five feet in length, and forms three sides of a square, enclosing as in a frame the small intestine. The latter enters it on the right side, but not at the ex- tremity, there being a blind end called the cascum, to which is at- tached a worm-like spiral tube, the vermi- form appendix. The caecum passes into the colon proper, ascending to the liver, then crossi ng below the stomach, so as to envelop the pancreas, and descending on the left side to form the S-shaped bend called the sigmoid flexure. This again is Tig. 11.- ■Thc Contents of Chest and Abdomen shown ia their Positions. A, Heart; r..

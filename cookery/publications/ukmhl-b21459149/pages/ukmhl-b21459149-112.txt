102 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. collapse. The question of heat-balance of the body, and how it may be affected by diet, will be discussed when dealing with the skin. The great supporter of combustion in this planet is the oxygen of the air, and Respiration may be denned as the interchange of gases between the blood and our environment. Strictly speaking, respiration occurs wherever there are living cells supplied with blood, for the haemoglobin of the red corpuscles car- ries thither sup- plies of oxygen and receives in return carbonic acid gas and water, the pro- ducts of combus- tion in the cell, but it is custom- ary to restrict the term respiration to the processes that go on in the lungs. The mechanism of respiration con- sists of the trachea or windpipe, the bronchial tubes, and the air-cells, the two latter constituting with the requisite blood-vessels the substance of the lungs. The -Windpipe consists of a series of half or three- quarter rings of cartilage or gristle, closed at the back by a membrane, and it lies in front of the gullet. To prevent food from passing " down the wrong throat" it is guarded at the top by a valve of elastic cartilage, the epiglottis, which folds down when food is passing; and in addition the windpipe is pulled upwards and forwards under the tongue, as may be felt by pressing "Adam's apple" while swallowing. Unlike the gullet, the windpipe is always open, and along with the bronchial tubes is lined with mucous membrane. This keeps the internal surface soft and moist, and to prevent mucus Fig. 25.â€”Bronchial Tubes.

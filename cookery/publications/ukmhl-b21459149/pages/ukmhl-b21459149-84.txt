78 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. Lesson 16.—THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. The tissues of the body receive their supplies of nutriment from the blood-vessels, which allow the more fluid portions of the blood to exude into the neighbourhood of the tissues. This fluid, which fills up all the little spaces between the tissues, and bathes the tissues themselves, is Lymph, and it acts as a go-between for these and the blood; certain consti- Fig. 15.—Mesenteric GlandB. 4 points to the membrane of the mesentery from which the bowel (5), seen in folds, is suspended.' 1 points to a gland, a large number of which is present, connected ^to one another and to the bowel by fine lymphatic vessels. 2 indicates a vein, and 3 an artery ramifyiug through the mesentery and over the boweL tuents of the blood pass into the lymph, are in turn assimilated by the tissues, while these again return some matters into the lymph stream and others directly into the blood. All tissues are not equally active, nor is any one equally active at all times; the gastric glands, for example, are not secreting gastric mice to any great extent when the stomach is empty. Since the blood supply is fairly uniform it follows that there will be a great amount of nutrient material unused by the tissues, and this unused material is drained off by special vessels called Lymphatics, to be utilized again in the blood-stream. Ihe lymph bathing the tissues may thus be considered as a reser- voir of nutriment, fed by one set of supply pipes, the arteries, and drained by two sets, the veins and the lymphatics, the

FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. 124 former point, although the milk has been impoverished in these two ways. Hence* specific gravity alone, as shown by the lactometer, is not a sufficient test of the richness of milk, but must be combined with the direct estimation of the fat. This is generally 4 per cent, and by the regulations of the Society of Public Analysts must not be less than 3. When milk is boiled there is formed on the surface a scum consisting of lact-albumen coagulated by the heat, with a thin skin of altered casein and some entangled fat globules; it is thus very nutritious and should not be thrown away, as is often Oil Globule9 of Oil Globules of Oil Globules of Colostrum with Human Milk.

In the process of making Devonshire or clotted cream a similar change takes place; the milk is heated in pans for hours under the boiling-point, and not only is the milk-albumen coagulated as above, but all lactic-acid germs are killed, and the cream consequently keeps for days if the jar be unbroken.

CHEESE. 135 g. Tl is the most digestible form of fat, and is specially suitable for children and invalids. 3. Skim-milk and butter-milk contain all the solids of milk except fat, and are thus highly nutritious, while lighter of digestion than milk. 4. Butter-milk is specially useful as a basis of diet in stomach disorders. Lesson 26.—CHEESE. The second great milk derivative is Cheese. In ^ making cheese, milk in whole or part is warmed to about 80° F., and then curdled by rennet, then the curd is minced, strained, coloured with annatto, salted, and finally pressed into shape in wooden moulds, care being taken to expel all the whey. Whey, thus formed as a bye-product, contains the natural salts of milk, potash and lime compounds; all the milk-sugar; whey-albumen, due to the action of rennet upon caseinogen already explained; and a little fat. Cheese, again, contains all the casein and some of the fat, but none of the natural milk-salts, their place being taken by common salt, a matter of some importance in the use of cheese as food. The following scheme represents the process of cheese- making :— Proteids,^— Casein, j cheege_ —is at, J Fat, — -—-^^/^Whey albumen, Lactose, ^~~~~Fat, Salts, Lactose, \ Whey.

In this process their fats increase at the expense of the proteids, and the casein becomes more soluble, perhaps owing to the formation of albuminate of soda, and even semi-fluid like peptone. At a later stage, leucin and tyrosin are formed, also at the expense of casein, along with butyric and valerianic acids, so that the whole ripening process bears a close resem- blance to that of proteid digestion in the intestines. Tn decomposing, cheese is apt to be attacked by various moulds —green, blue, and red,—also by cheese mites, the larvae of

THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 81 body cavity. From this it proceeds by a narrower tube, about as thick as a slate-pencil, up the chest or thorax, whence it gets the name of Thoracic Duct (1); then the lymph reaches the neck, where it enters the blood-stream at the fork (3) made by the large veins on the left from the head and shoulder. The lymphatics of the right side and the upper part of the body pour their contents into the corresponding fork on the right. Fatty foods have thus the following history:—They are not digested till they reach the small intestine, when under the combined action of the pancreatic juice and the bile they are a, Small intestine; b, lacteals and mesenteric glands; c, receptacle of the chyle; d, thoracic duct; e, superior vena cava; f, veins of intestine; g, portal vein; h, liver; i, hepatic veins; k, inferior vena cava; 1, right auricle of heart; m, mesentery. partly saponified but chiefly emulsified. In the act of passing through the bowel wall the soaps thus formed are re-formed into oil, so that all the fat passes into the lacteals as an emul- sion, giving rise to the milky fluid called chyle. This passes through the mesenteric glands, receiving lymph-corpuscles en route; is then collected in the receptacle of the chyle, and finally creeps up the back of the chest in the thoracic duct to be poured into the blood-stream where the left jugular vein joins the vein of the left shoulder. On pp. 76, 77 it was noted that other food-stuffs are absorbed into the veins of the digestive tract as water, salts, sugar, and albumens, and it now remains to trace their history. The veins of the stomach and intestines, including those from the spleen, unite into one short trunk called the Portal Vein, which, instead of proceeding direct to the heart as most veins do, enters the liver and there divides into smaller and smaller vessels, thus forming a capillary network at either end of its ( M 173 ) Jf a Fig. 17.—Scheme of Intestinal Absorption.

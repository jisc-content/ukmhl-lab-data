BLOOD. 89 less when viewed singly, though reddish in mass (fig. 21, a, b). In shed blood they show a remarkable tendency to adhere by their Hat surfaces, like piles of coppers; but this does not occur in the living blood-vessels. Occasionally there may be seen bodies of another sort—the colourless or "White Corpuscles (fig. 21, c). They are larger, being about grins' inch in diameter, whereas the red corpuscles are only about ^inch. If instead of examining a drop of blood outside the body, it is examined Fig. 21.—A Drop of Blood, seen under a Microscope magnifying by 350 diameters. in the living state as in a tadpole's tail, the corpuscles may be followed quite easily, since in the frog they are much larger than in man. In a small blood-vessel we see the swiftly-moving mass of red corpuscles keeping in the centre of the stream, exactly as in a street, the corpuscles rolling over one another, sometimes bent, but recovering their shape in virtue of their elasticity, and going where the blood-stream carries them, some into capillary vessels so minute that they have enough to do to squeeze through. But besides these, and in marked contrast to them, there will be observed an occasional white corpuscle, sometimes standing in the very middle of the stream, like a poli ceman controlling the traffic, more often rolling against the wall of the vessel with slow and deliberate motion, even going back or making its way through the wall alto-

Konig gives the following as the average of 250 different analyses:— Water, Nitrogenous, Fat, Sugar, Gum and dextrin, Starch, Indigestible fibre, Ash, 13-56 12-42 Higher in Italian and Russian wheat. Wheat is the most deficient in fat of all the British grains. Varying from 60 to 90 per cent. ,7q \ Chiefly phosphates of potash and magnesia, with I a little lime, soda, and silica. Eussian wheat is richer in nitrogenous matters, ranging up to 2H per cent. The hard Italian and Hungarian wheats are also rich in nitrogenous matters, containing soluble albumen as gluten. The grain is surrounded by two coats, an outer coat or cuticle and the inner composed of bran cells; underneath this lie the gluten cells containing also fat and salts, while the centre of the grain is occupied by starch cells. Associated with the latter is cerealin, a form of diastase, which helps to The cuticle and bran cells are removed by grinding, which" leaves behind a completely di- gestible flour, white or yellowish-white in colour and fine m Fig. 35.—Vertical Section of Wheat. render the starch self-digesting.

249 FOOD AND DIET. This gives 1 of proteids to 3| or 4 of others, the total amount of water-free food being say 23 ozs. per 24 hours. Since food on an average contains 50 to 60 per cent of water, the total "solid" food is thus 48 to 60 ozs., added to which from 50 to 80 ozs. of water are taken as liquids, bringing up the total water to 70 or 90 ozs., or A ounce per pound of body- weight. The proportions of the proximate principles is thus 1 proteid : -6 fat: 3 carbohydrates, or as given above, 1 of nitrogenous to 3-6 of non-nitrogenous matters, or if elements be wanted instead, 1 of nitrogen to 14 or 15 of carbon. These proportions vary with season and climate, with the growth and development of the individual, and with the amount of work done. To calculate the percentage of proximate principles in any given diet, a table of dietaries is required such as is given beloAv, and the operation is simply one of calculating percentages. To tell what quantities of given food-stuffs are required is more elaborate, demanding a knowledge of equa- tions, but the following examples from Notter and Willoughby will demonstrate the method. Taking as the clay's diet 5 ozs. proteids, 3 ozs. fat, 15 ozs. carbohydrates, and 1 oz. salts, what should be the quantities of bread, salt butter, and Dutch cheese in the daily ration 1 By the tables— Proteids.

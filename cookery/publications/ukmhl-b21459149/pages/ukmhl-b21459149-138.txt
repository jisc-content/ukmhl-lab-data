It is deficient in fat and casein, and is thus easily digested by invalids whose stomachs cannot tolerate cow's milk. Cow's milk, as will be seen from the table, is richer than human milk in everything but sugar; hence when given to infants it must be diluted with boiling water to three times its bulk to begin with, and after a month or so half and half, and a little sugar added. The coagulation of cow's milk within the human stomach has already been mentioned. Strictly speaking, the sugar added to cow's milk to bring it up to the human standard should be lactose, which is generally prepared from whey, and thus contains some of the milk-salts. It is claimed that lactose has not the same tendency as ordinary sugar to undergo acetic fermentation, but it is said, on the other hand, that it is more ready than the latter to become lactic acid, while it is comparatively clear. The following has been given as a recipe for "humanized" milk. Allow J pint of new milk to stand for 12 hours; call this No. 1. Cream this, and add the cream to § pint of fresh milk; No. 2. By means of rennet curdle the skim-milk of No. 1 from 5 to 15 minutes; break up the curd when formed, and separate all the whey. Rapidly heat this whey by boiling, which coagulates the whey albumen, called "Meetings", and strain through muslin to remove this. In the hot whey dissolve 110 grams, say } oz.,

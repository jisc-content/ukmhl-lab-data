72 FOOD AND ITS FUNCTIONS. slow. So great is the amount of activity in the lower part of the large intestine that the reaction of its contents, instead of being strongly alkaline, may become acid through the great development of acids formed in putrefaction. The action of the several digestive ferments may be shown graphically in the diagram on preceding page. SUMMARY OF THE DIGESTIVE FERMENTS. Fluid. Ferment.. Action. Saliva, Gastric Juice, Pancreatic Juice, Intestinal Juice, Bile Ptyalin, Rennin, Pepsin, Invertin, ... Amylopsin, Trypsin, ... Steapsin, ... Emulsive, ... Invertin, ... Proteolytic, Diastatic, ... Turning starch into maltose. Milk curdling. Turning proteids into peptones. Turning cane-sugar into glucose. Like ptyalin. Like pepsin in alkaline medium. Decomposing fats. Emulsifying fats. Inverting sucrose. Like pepsin and trypsin. Like ptyalin. SUMMAEY. 1. The large intestine is about five or six feet long, and three inches wide. 2. It has neither villi nor valvulse conniventes. 3. Its entrance is guarded by the ileo-colic valve, and it terminates in the i-ectum. 4. The process in the large intestine is chiefly putrefactive fer- mentation, carried on chiefly by bacteria. 5. By putrefaction, fats and proteids are further decomposed into simpler compounds, but even the feces contain oxidizable matters. G. About 5 ozs. of feces are excreted per day. Lesson 15.â€”ABSORPTION. Since food materials have to be turned into blood in ordc to reach the tissues, the whole process of digestion aims e rendering those materials soluble and diffusible. Water an salts soluble in it, sugar and the like, are already in the liqiu

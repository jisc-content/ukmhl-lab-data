Professor in the University of Wales, and Professor of Biology and Geology University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. The book is intended to meet the requirements ofâ€”(1) elementary students, whether self-taught or following the subject in class; (2) students of General Biology who wish to supplement that subject on the physiological side, as is often the case with those intending to go on to medical work; (3) students of Psychology who desire a simple account of the Nervous System and Sense Organs; (4) students of Agriculture and Dairying. The last chapter, which deals with secretion of milk and digestion in the cow, has been inserted in the hope that the last class of students may find it useful. Great pains have been taken to make it both accurate and lucid, and emphasis has been laid on Practical Work, to which a special chapter is devoted. The necessary Chemistry has been introduced where most relevant, instead of being lumped into an introductory chapter. LABORATORY EXERCISE BOOK. For Chemical Students, containing Tables for Analysis, Sheets for Eesults, &c. By E. Francis, f.c.s., People's Col., Nottingham. 6d.

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A KITCHEN.

That the smoke-jack increases the draught of the chimney, as some ironmongers pretend, is a statement almost too ridiculous to be seriously refuted. The assertion that all the fire that is required to make a smoke-jack perform properly would be necessary in the kitchen for other purposes, and con- sequently that they occasion no additional expense of fuel in roasting, is very incorrect, though a small fire will make it turn when not loaded with the spit. 4671. To increase the effect of the fire upon the meat in roasting, as well as to prevent the radiant heat from incommoding the kitchen, a screen, fig. 635., is always placed before the fire, lined within with tin plate. This is now generally furnished with shelves to place plates and dishes upon to warm, or to keep the meat hot until it is wanted. On the back of the screen are sliding 4672. The heat from very large ranges would be intolerable to the cooks, were it not for the screens which are placed before them. Fig. 636. represents that of the City Club House on the side next the fire. It is about seven feet high, lined with tin plate, and has shelves on the side next the fire to place dishes with meat on to keep hot; doors on the back give access to the dishes. It is a great improvement to shut in also the ends by folding-doors, thus entirely enclosing the fire-place. By this means the greatest part of the radiant heat of the fire is stopped from coming into the kitchen. In the woodcut

Bed-steps, fig. 424., are necessary to ascend some beds that are made very high, and within are frequently placed a night con- venience. 1229. Toilet or dressing tables are fitted up in an infinite variety of ways, from the plain table with the toilet cover and mirror placed upon it, to the most expensive kinds, and a proper selection adds much to comfort. 1230. Fig. 425. represents one of the most usual plain kind made at present. As this table is commonly "placed against the window for the advantage of good light, if the mirror is placed upon it loose, it is very apt to be blown down and perhaps broken when the window is left open. The best way, therefore, is to have the mirror and frame to slide up and down by means of balance weights, as in a window sash. An additional shelf may be made to draw out to the right to gain room if required : at the bottom is a cushion to put the feet upon.

Fig. 429. is a large cheval gla.is that stands on the floor, for viewing the whole person, with lights on each side. Fig. 430. is a small dressing-glass for the toilet-table with a drawer. Fig. 431. is another with the drawer omitted, which is now usually done : this must be loaded at the bottom to prevent being easily thrown down.

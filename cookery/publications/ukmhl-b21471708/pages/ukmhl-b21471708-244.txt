218 Book V. ON HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE. 1026. With lite view of endeavouring la reform this ivretched condition into which this branch of art had sunk amongst us, Mr. Thomas Hope employed a part of his princely fortune in filling his house in London with furniture of a very superior kind, all of -which was designed and executed in this country. To supply some models for improving the taste of the cabinet-makers and upholsterers, as well as that of the public, he afterwards caused the whole to be very accurately drawn and engraved, and they were published in a folio volume in 1807. In this work he describes the lamentable condition in which he found this branch of the useful and fine arts ; and we cannot do better than quote from the " Introduction " to this work some observations illustrative of Mr. Hope's views :â€”" Each of the different articles of household furniture, however simple be its texture, and however mean its destination, is cajiable of uniting to the more essential requisites of utility and comfort, for which it is most immediately framed, and with which it can consequently on no account dispense, a certain number of secondary attributes of elegance and beauty, which, without impeding the chief purpose of the object, may enable its shape and acces- sories to afford additional gratification both to the eye and to the imagination." " Almost every one of these various articles, however, abandoned till very lately in this country to the taste of the sole upholder, entirely ignorant of the most familiar prin- ciples of visible beauty, wholly uninstructed in the simplest rudiments of drawing, or at most only fraught with a few wretched ideas and trivial conceits, boiTowed from the worst models of the French school of the middle of the last century, was left totally desti- tute of those attributes of true elegance and beauty, which, though secondary, are yet of such importance to the extension of our rational pleasures. Furniture of every descrip- tion, wrought by the most mechanical processes only, either remained absolutely void of all ornament whatever, or, if made to exhibit any attempt at embellishment, offered in its decoration no approach towards that breadth and repose of surface, that distinctness and contrast of outline, that opposition of plain and of enriched parts, that harmony and sig- nificance of accessories, and that apt accord between the peculiar meaning of each imitative or significant detail, and the peculiar destination of the main object to which these acces- sories belonged, which are calculated to afford to the eye and mind the most lively, most permanent, and most unfading enjoyment. The ai'ticle only became, in consequence of its injudicious appendages, more expensive, without becoming more beautiful; and such remained the insipidity of the outline, and the unmeaningness of the embellishments, even in the most costly pieces, that generally, even long before the extreme insolidity and flimsiness of their texture could induce material injury in them from the effects of regular wear and tear, the inanity and sameness of their shapes and appendages already com- pletely tired the eye and mind, and left these no other means to escape from the weariness and the disgust which they occasioned, than an instant change for other objects of a more recent date and a more novel construction. Thus all those sums and all that labour were wasted upon ever-varying objects of transient whim and puerile fashion, which, by being employed in the formation and in the purchase of objects of lasting perfection and beauty, might have increased in endless progress the opulence of the individual and the wealth of the community." " If any one felt a desire to decorate his habitation with furniture of superior elegance of form and of design, unable, from the infrequency of the demand, and from the conse- quent inability of the artificer, to get any such wrought at home, he was obliged to pro- cure it from abroad. Often, at a great expense, he would only obtain the refuse of foreign manufactures ; and even where he succeeded in importing the choicest productions of continental industry, these only served to discourage our own artists, to diminish the balance of trade in our favour, and, by a tacit acknowledgment of our inferiority in the arts of elegance and taste, to raise the pride of foreigners at our expense." Mr. Hope adds, that, by adopting in his own case a style of furniture that should employ the talents of the " professor of the more liberal arts, the draughtsman, the modeller, the painter, and the sculptor," he wished, by a successful example, to entice the wealthy to appreciate the charms of art, and divert a large portion of their opulence from being wasted iu objects of mere trivial amusement, instead of being expended in those of durable and solid grati- fication ; and, by a patriotic encouragement and improvement of our artists and manu- facturers, enable the lover of elegant refinement to procure at home those objects of superior design and execution which heretofore he was obliged to obtain from abroad. Mr. Hope possessed some knowledge of drawing, and he made the designs for the fur- niture which he procured to be executed, and which are engraved and published in the work above mentioned. The style which he adopted is nearly tliat which was in fashion in France at the time, and iu the invention of which Percier and Fontaine, and other French arcliitects and designers, had so much share. It was founded chiefly upon clas- sical forms, such ns are to be met with in anticiuc remains, adapted as nearly as possible to inodoni wants and usages ; and such was the dilliculty which he mot with in following out 1ms idea, and such was the slate of this branch of the art in England at that time, that lie observes, " Throughout this vast metropolis, teeming as it does witli artificers and

Book V. 234 ON HOUSEHOLD FUENITURE. 1092. Billiard tables are frequent pieces of furniture in the villas, -where they are used for exercise. They are usually placed in a room devoted to that use. As it is of great consequence that the table-top shall be quite level, great care is employed in fixing it. Sometimes spirit levels are attached to it, with screws for adjusting the top to a perfect level. They are usually made of mahogany, covered with green cloth: but they are also made of cast iron, and of slate. Figs. 205, 206, 207, 208., are tables in the style of Elizabethan furniture. 1093. Ladies work tables are small tables for holding the lighter articles of their work, and are generally fitted up with convenient places for cottons, needles, pins, scissors, &c. They are sometimes plain, of mahogany, with small drawers, as Jig. 209., or with a silk bag fluted with a fringe, as fg. 210., fixed to a frame that draws out for holding various articles of needlework that are in progress.

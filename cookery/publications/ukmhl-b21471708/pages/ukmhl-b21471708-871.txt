FURNITURE OF THE KITCHEN, ETC. 845 Chap. IV. Fig. 721. Fig. 722. Fig. 722. is the -well-known japanned plate wanner for the parlour in small families. Fig. 723. is a lower kind sold in the shops under the name of vegetable warmers, for keeping those dishes of vegetables warm that are not put upon the table. They are set down before the fire. Fig. 723. 4775. Plate ivarmers are now constructed as fg. 724., in which a vessel filled witli burn- ing charcoal is placed to keep plates and dishes hot; and these are sometimes placed in the dining room. Although they are found effective for their intended purpose, we cannot recommend the employment of charcoal in this way, since its fumes are so extremely preju- dicial, which must add much to contaminate the air, where already several causes, such as respiration and lights, tend to injure it. An iron heater placed in such a receptacle would not have any bad effect, and though this will not keep hot so long as charcoal, yet, with good management, the heat given by it to the plates will generally last sufficiently long at private dinners. We have seen one fitted up like an elegant piece of oak furniture with carving, _/7^. 725., which remained always in the dining room, and the use of which could not be suspected. The heater was placed in it just before dinner commenced; and it might easily be renewed without its being observed. It is scarcely necessary to add that it was lined with tin, and had shelves. ^â€¢(ir.725. 477G. Hot water dishes, a, fig. 72fi., are used for certain large joints of meat, hashes, and various other things. They are formed by having a reservoir for hot water beneath the dish itself, the water being poured in at c is the cover. 4777. Gravy /tellies, Jig. 727., are for keeping gi-avies hot to pour over various dishes as they are cooking; they are of copper, and are heated over the charcoal stove or hot plate.

We shall not detain our readers long on the subject of the -wines of the ancient inations, but a few words will not be misplaced to fill up our sketch of the historical part fof this subject; and particularly as this beverage, so much esteemed among the Greeks aand Romans, is often alluded to by classic authors. It is proper to state, that we are i indebted to the elegant work on wines by Dr. Henderson for many of the leading facts con this interesting subject. * 3497. The invention of luine must date from that period when truth cannot be separated ffrom fable: it was ascribed to Bacchus by the Grecian poets; and no doubt, when once (idiscovered, the knowledge of so fascinating a liquid soon made its way through the civil- i:ised part of the ancient world. 3498. The effect produced by the fermentation of vegetable matter must have been perceived • shortly after the commencement of gardening and agriculture. When the juice of fruits, the agrape, for instance, was kept for some time, this fermentation would appear in a very > i-evident manner; nor was the result less striking; instead of the sweet luscious taste pecu- niar to the grape, it would be found, after the fermentation was over, to have acquired new flflavour and other properties. Its taste had become what we now call vinous,- and, after (Idrinking it, a delirium of the senses was felt, to which we give the name of intoxication. \We can very easily conceive that mere accident might have led to this discovery, which aappears to have been made at a very ancient period of human history. We learn from SScripture, that Noah " planted a vineyard; and he drank the wine, and was drunken." \Whether this was the commencement of fermented liquors it would be useless now to innquire; but there can be no doubt but that the person who was first intoxicated must bhave been so from entire ignorance of the nature of that state. Happy would it have libeen for man if he had always remained in that ignorance ; or, with this addition to his kknowledge, had he been sutiiciently impressed with all the dangers that might result from hhis discovery! But it is with this as with many other things; he too often converts that innto evil, which, under proper guidance, might prove a benefit. 3499. The grape, like most of our fruits, appears to Itave come originally from the milder

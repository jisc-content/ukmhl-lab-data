More elegant French beds are made of mahogany, somewhat in the form of a -sola or couch, and have canopies and draperies of a more fanciful kind, ornamented in vvarious ways, as^s. 402, 403. Fiy. 4U4. is one upon a classical model. 1194. Tent beds, figs. 405, ana 406., are in very general use in England. Four upright posts are placed at the corners of the bed frame, with its sacking or laths ; and on the bed-posts rest the tester laths, which drop on iron pins on the top, that are covered by wooden knobs. The posts at the foot of the bed are turned and ornamented in some way, but those at the head are made square and plain, as they are always covered by the cur- tains ; into a groove in them the head-board is inserted. The curtains to throw over the â– whole, are usually made of chintz ; they are fastened up in the day by cords, and not drawn on rods.

Invalids frequently require peculiar articles of furniture to afford them ease and l;lief Without attempting to detail all the contrivances for this purpose, -which must aary in some degree with the particular cases, we shall give examples of such articles as, eeing frequently demanded, are usually made and kept for sale. 1251. Reclining chairs are found convenient not only for invalids, hut for affording rest fi'ter fatigue, or for varying the position of the body on occasion. Fig. 465. represents one that when upright may be used as an ordinary chair; but by the back and seat sliding round on the circumference of the arched legs, the chair is brought into a position for reclining, as at fig. 466.; and a rest for the legs and feet may be drawn out from beneath the seat. These chairs are covered with Morocco leather and stuffed. Fig. 467. is one where the back may be made to fonn any angle with the seat by a joint, and may be laid almost quite flat, the arms i'iding in a groove in the frame of the seat. 1252. The Douro chair, Jig. 468., is said to have been invented by the Marquis of Douro i 1 a camp chair. The back is made to slope in any degree required, merely by shifting lae holes in the leather straps by which it is supported; and it thus becomes a very tconomical and comfortable easy or arm-chair. To render it portable, the frame is made 11 fold up flat with the greatest facility, and the stuffed back and seat being laid upon it, lae whole is strapped into a square package. 1253. A rocking chair for exercise is represented in fig. 469. It is made wholly of iron 'i'ith a stuffed covering, but not very heavy.

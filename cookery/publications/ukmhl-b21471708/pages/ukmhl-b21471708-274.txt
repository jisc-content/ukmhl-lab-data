248 ON HPUSEHOLD FURNITURE. Book V. 1127. Library chairs vary much with the taste and habits of the possessor, but have usually the plainness and solidity of those of the parlour or eating room. Figs. 295. and 296. are library or summer chairs, with cane back and seats. IRS i Fig. 2SG. ^""-^ Fig. 297. is called by upholsterers the classical chair: it is useful in the library, and possesses the advantage by the seat being made to revolve : the person sitting in it may very easily turn himself round to speak to any one, without shifting the place of his chair.

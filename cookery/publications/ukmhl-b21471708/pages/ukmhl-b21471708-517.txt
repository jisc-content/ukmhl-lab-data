Chap. IX. FRUITS USED AS FOOD IN BRITAIN. 491 Dried plums are called prunes, of which several kinds are met with in the shops and used at the dessert: the Brignolle plums, brought from BrignoUe in Provence, which is of a reddish yellow colour, and has a grateful sweet sub-acid taste; the common French prune ; and the Damascene plum. Others come from the banks of the Rhine, by way of Holland, and others, again, are brought from Portugal. The common medicinal prune comes chiefly from Bordeaux. 2696. The sloe is a shrub common in our hedgerows, and belongs to the natural order Amygdaleae. The fruit is about the size of a large pea, of a black colour, and covered with a bloom of a bright blue ; it is one of the few indigenous to our island. The juice is extremely sharp and astringent, and was formerly employed as a medicine where an astrmgent was necessary : it is employed in the manufacture of a red wine made to imitate port, and also for adulteration. The leaves have been employed to sophisticate tea. The fruit, when ripe, makes a good preserve. 2697. TJie bird cherry (^Prunus Padus, Linn.) is a fruit little known, and nauseous to most palates, but when infused in gin or whiskey, it greatly improves these spirits, and the infusion is only surpassed by that of peach leaves. SiTBSECT. 5 Cherry ( Cerasus duracina, Linn.). 2698. It is a question whether this beautiful fruit be indigenous in Britain. It is generally stated that the cherry was brought to Italy by the Roman general Lucullus from a town in Asia called Cerasus, and that we owe it to the Romans. This may be true of some varieties, but the cherry appears to be a native of most temperate countries of the Northern hemisphere, and a small black wild cherry is found in Herefordshire, and even in the mountains of Scotland; this, when cultivated in Aberdeenshire, where it is known by the name of Geans, is a delicious fruit. At some of the ruins of our abbeys and baronial castles there are stUl existing some of these black cherry trees that have attained the height of sixty or eighty feet, and which now produce vast quantities of fruit. AU agree that the cherry has been a favom-ite fruit in England, and in general cultivation, ever since the time of Henry VIII., when it was planted in Kent, where cherry orchards were formerly very extensive, and are still celebrated ; but this fruit was probably intro- duced here at a much earlier period, for it is ascertained that in the fifteenth century it was hawked about the streets of London in the same manner as at present. 2699. About two hundred varieties of cherries are enumerated, some of which are in sea- son, from the Kentish and May duke at the beginning of autumn, to the yellow Spanish and MorUlo late in the winter. When perfectly ripe they are refreshing, and are excel- lent for pies and tarts. A wine is made from the juice resembling red Constantia, A spirit is also distilled on the Continent from the pulp fermented, called Kirschevasser. The liquor called cherry brandy is made by putting the best black varieties into brandy. Noyeau is a liquor flavoured by the kernels of the variety Cerasus occidentalis; and a large black cherry is employed in the ratafia of Grenoble. The maraschino of Zara is made from a particular species cultivated in Dahnatia. 2700. The Cherry is, by some botanists, included in the same genus as the plum (Prunus"), and, like all this class of stone fruits, contains in its leaves and kernels some of the prin- ciples which are the source of the agreeable flavour resembling that of the peach blossom. The poisonous liquid called laurel water is made by distilling the leaves of the bird cherry: those of the Lauro-cerasus, or cherry-laurel, as well as some other cherry leaves, afford a similar liquid, although the fruits are not poisonous. SuBSECT. 6. — Olive (fDlea Europcea, Linn.). 2701. The olive tree is interesting from historical recollections. It was the leaf of this tree, brought into the ark by the dove, that gave the first evidence of the waters of the deluge having abated, since which time it has been em- (y\ a ployed as an emblem of peace. The olive was sacred to \ « A Minerva; it frequently appears in Grecian sculpture, and a \^ Yj Ij\ —wreath made of the leaves was a reward bestowed in the \ M A/ / / J / / games of Athens. The mention in Scripture of the Mount 1/ j / / I of Olives near to Jerusalem proves it to have been a fa- r> y vourite tree in Palestine; and it is an interesting fact, that ■^^j^v^W^^^T^?—^ olives StUl exist upon the spot.

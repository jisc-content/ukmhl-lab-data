Part of the top may be made to lift up as a desk to write â€” on ; and a shallow drawer may pull out on the right to hold ink, pens, ^ &c., and also a shelf may be made to draw out on the left to increase the size of the top on occasions.

Card-lables were formerly made as Jig. 194., with the top to fold, one half of which was supported by two of the legs which were made to turn out.

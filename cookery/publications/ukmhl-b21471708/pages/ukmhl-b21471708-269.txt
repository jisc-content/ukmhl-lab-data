Ottomans are stuffed seats placed along the walls in the Turkish manner, as in fg. 262., or they may be insulated, and placed in any part of the room, as in Jig. 263. They are found extremely agreeable and convenient, and help to break the formality of the more important furniture. They are particularly useful in picture galleries, music rooms, anterooms, &c. Sect. VIII. CHAIRS AND SEATS. 1118. Scarcely any article of furniture has undergone so many changes, and admits of such variety of forms, as chairs. The use of a chair being for a seat, there are certain principles which should regulate its form, though these have been frequently ill under- stood, or interfered with by the fashion of the day. Independently of the elegance, the forms of chairs, on which depends the easiness of the seat, may not be an object of great consideration to persons who sit but little ; but to those who are in the habit of sitting for many hours at a time, it is of the first importance that the shape of the chair be such that the weight of the body may not press unequally upon it. These principles appeift to have been well understood by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, since the forms of their chairs were simple, but admirably adapted to their purpose. 1119. Tlic French artists, with Mr. Hope, in coppivg or imitating the antique style, produced some of the best chairs, the forms of which are still retained, or have given hints for the most perfect now in use. Figs. 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272. are chairs in the antique style. R 2

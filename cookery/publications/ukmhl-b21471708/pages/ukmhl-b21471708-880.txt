Below the hot plate, on the right, is an oven, and on the left is a boiler which supplies a set of steamers in another part of the kitchen. 4818. Several other ranges, nearly similar, are manufactured by various ironmongers, but not so different as to demand a separate description. It must be observed, that we decline giving any opinion on the eflicacy of these ranges, in which the fire is covered by a hot plate, as they require more trial than we have been able to give them. But it is very evident, that they are very expensive in the first instance, and require the cook to be tauglithow to use themj they are also very apt to be out of order, the narrow flues requiring to be frequently cleaned out.

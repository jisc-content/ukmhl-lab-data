PREFACE. ;Much has been written on various subjects connected with Domestic ; Economy ; and it was the wish of the late Mr. Longman many years ago to : see collated into one large volume, for the convenience of reference, inform- ; ation useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments, 1 but which was then scattered in fragments through thousands of pages. ' The difficulties attending such a compilation had long prevented its execu- ition, since it was found upon trial, tliat little had been published suited to I the advancing state of science. To conduct such a work became at length the occupation of the present Editor, whose task has been to select and arrange the subjects, and to treat I them as he best could, consistently with his own views and the limits of the [publication. To tliis labour he has devoted what time he could spare from liis [professional pm'suits during the last ten years, and the work being now com- ipleted it may be proper to inform those to whom he is best known as a 1 Geologist, what circumstances led the publishers to request him to undertake ;such a task.

It was conceived that some of the expe- i-ricnce thus acquired might be available in such a woi'k as the present; and 'that, by incorporating the principal modern improvements in Domestic Eco- nomy, the object might, in some degree, be attained. It may be proper to state the views which have guided the Editor througli- out the work, "Without going into the subject of education, the present state of society, the use and abuse of time, it cannot but be admitted that it is extremely desirable, on many accounts, that tliose who occupy elevated positions in the social scale sliould possess that species of information, which would assist them in fulfilling their domestic duties. This kind of information, however, is not easily acquired in a desultory inunner, parti-

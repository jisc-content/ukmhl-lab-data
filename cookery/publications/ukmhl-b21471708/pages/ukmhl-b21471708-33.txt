Many considerable mansions -were executed in this manner c during the succeeding reigns, including that of Elizabeth, some of which yet remain Fig. 16. tolerably perfect, and have acquired for the style itself, among English architects, the appellation of " Elizabethan," although it is evidently of foreign extraction. Good ex- amples of it may be seen in the recent publica- tions by Shaw, Nash, and others. Fig. 17. is a doorway in that style. A kind of architecture so radically defective, notwithstanding a certain degree of merit which is allowed to it, could not long resist the effect of studying with diligence the remains of clas- sical art in Italy ; and from that country better idea.s of antique Roman architecture were brought to this country by Inigo Jones, who imitated the manner of Palladio with success. With him commenced, in England, what is termed the Gre- cian (more properly Roman) style, but in which many of the errors of the Cinque Cento were long retained. In the banquettmg house of the palace of "Whitehall, we see one of the best examples of the architecture of Inigo Jones.

851 EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS KITCHEN FIRE-PLACES. 3 I 2 I Chap. V. 1 -s i Fig. 748. < On the left of the chimney there is a hot plate, with a separate fire-place set in brickwork ; i and this is in general the best way of fitting up the hot plate, since the bricks confine the 1 heat, and the kitchen is not made so warm as when the whole is of iron. The hot plate I may be placed in any part of the kitchen where there is a possibility of having a flue. lil;iiliiiiiiiiiiiiijfliiiJ.?.iiiii:'.iiawii'i.iuiiiiiiiia>ibtiii(iUiii.iiMi,ii[.,.iiuiiii)^ Fig. 749. ■Il- |.:ii.|-iJtllli| l..|,,.,^i^.U|ili..l..|l...llir.i-.4-'' I I I I I I I I I I I I I yy III I I 1 I r 4811. In some places they have tried to do away with the use of an open fire and 1 kitchen range, and to depend upon hot plates, baking ovens, steam, and other modes lately : introduced; but however economical these arrangements may be in point of fuel, and ' however well adapted to particular cases, we cannot recommend the banishment of I the kitchen range, when we consider the frequent change of servants, their general want < of intelligence, and the great attention and care which these new modes demand, though I excellent in principle. 4812. When there is no flue to carry off the air heated by the hot plate and the ! steamers, the hot air comes into the kitchen, causing the place to be uncomfortably warm ; ■ to prevent this effect, it is best, if possible, to place these parts of the apparatus in recesses in the wall like chimneys, the flues of which may either go to the top of the house, or , join the chimney flue. This will add much to the healthiness of the kitchen ; but the possibility of effecting this improvement must depend upon the locality ; and a good light in these recesses is necessary. Fig. 750. represents such an arrangement, where the

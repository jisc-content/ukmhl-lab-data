441 VEGETABLES USED AS FOOD. CuAP. VI r. Nature, in forming vegetable ni:itter, or vegetable arrangements, follows Uie same plan as Avheu composing animal matter • in both cases, proximate principles arejiml cumpuaed; but the proximate principles of vegetables are diU'erent, except a few, from those of animals. 230.). By what means plants compose their pro.vinuitc principles out of the four elements is a mystery which we cannot penetrate ; it must be classed with the incomprehensible functions by which they increase and propagate their species, and with those laws by which they continue to present the same forms and qualities through innumerable genera- tions ; phenomena which cannot fail to impress upon the mind of the careful inquirer, a conviction that the whole is regulated by causes and powers far transcending our limited capacities to explain, and demonstrating an omniscient and superintending Providence. We shall, therefore, in studying vegetable substances, have to enumerate a set of bodies caWhA. proximate principles, belonging to the vegetable kingdom, generally distinct from those appertaining to animals. All these exist ready formed in the plant, in the same manner as in the case of animals; and all vegetables may be resolved first into these before their final dissolution into their elementary constituents, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. 2306. The proximate principles of vegetables are: 1. Starch or fecula. 2. Gluten. 3. Vegetable albumen. 4. Sugar, or the saccharine principle. 5. Gum, or mucilage. 6. Lignin, or woody fibre. 7. Vegetable jelly, or pectin. S. Vegetable oils, fixed and volatile. 9. Vegetable wax. The first five of these principles, viz., starch, gluten, vegetable albumen, sugar, and gum, constitute the principal ingredients in most of the esculent vegetables ; and starch and gluten are much more nutritious than the rest. 2307. The comparative nutritive properties of the several vegetable substances used as food is best known by chemical analysis. It having been already determined by long observa- tion which of the vegetable proximate principles afibrd the most nourishment, or tend most to the support of life by the process of digestion, chemical analysis will, by showing the relative proportions of these principles in each species of plants, enable us readily to distinguish which kind is most nutritive. 10.

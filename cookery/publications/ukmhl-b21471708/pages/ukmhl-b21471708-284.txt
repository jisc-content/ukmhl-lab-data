Book V. ON HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE, 258 instead of a glaze, they were covered with a yarnish of bitumen, which admitted of a fine polish, and was, besides, very durable. 1160. Fine examples of Eyi/pUan and Etnisain vases, made of earthenware, may be seen in the British Museum, of which fic/s. 361, 362, 363. 364, 36.5, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371. are copies. Fiy. 365, is a large lEtruscan vase richly painted with black figures on the red ground peculiar to that ware. 1161. Fiys. 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377. 378, 379, 380. are Greek vases of marble. 1162.

The Florentine alabaster vases have been already alluded to, when speaking of sculpture. 1163. Vases of fluor spar from Derbyshire are extremely beautiful. M. de Rozicre wrote, some years ago, an interesting work to prove that it was of this substance the famous Mitrrhine vases of the ancients, so highly prized, were made : and there really appears much weight in his arguments, this substance agreeing with the ancient descrip- tion more nearly than any other known material. 1164. Paintings and drawings form some of the most desirable ornaments of our apartments on many accounts. Oil pictures demand gilt frames ; drawings do very well in frames of various elegant woods. The hanging of pictures properly requires judgment, and much depends upon the direction of the light that comes on them. A side light is the best, and the worst is fronting a window, as the gloss of the varnish forms a sort of mirror, in consequence of which they cannot be seen except the spectator stands on one side. It is mortifying to see a good picture hung in a bad light, and a bad picture had better not be hung up at all. But certain drawings are not so much injured by the eflect of light, and may be placed where an oil picture would be lost.

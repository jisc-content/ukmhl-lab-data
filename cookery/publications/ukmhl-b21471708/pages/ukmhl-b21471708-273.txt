I Chap. X. FURNITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL APARTMENTS. 247 R 4 1126. Drawing room chairs. Figs. 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290. admit of more carving ; and other ornaments than those for the parlour, and they are made of a lighter construc- I tion. Mahogany is sometimes the material; but now more frequently satinwood, rose- â€¢ -wood, tulip and other rare -woods. Sometimes also they are beautifully japanned or I painted and gilt. The seats are covered with rich silk, and flowered satins, painted velvets, superfine cloth, worsted worked, or chintz, and at present it is the fashion to go to considerable expense in these chairs, when of the ornamental kind. Mixed with the more massy drawing room chairs, it is now the custom to have a variety of others of a much simpler kind, and extremely light, usually termed conversation or gossipping chairs. These have the seats mostly of split cane or of rush. Fig. 291. is a chair of this kind of a French pattern : fig. 292. is Italian : fig. 29,3. and 294. are Swiss forms. Occasionally some drawing room chairs have the seats very low and the backs high: in short, more whim and caprice is shown in chairs than in any other article of furniture.

Chap. IV. FOUR-WHEELED CARRIAGES WITHOUT PERCHES. 1117 6651. The Pilentum, Jig. 869., invented by Mr. Davies, coach-builder, of Wigmore Street, London, is one of the most characteristic of carriages -without a perch. It is a four-wheeled carriage, the fore and hind parts of the body resting upon the elliptic springs that are placed upon the iron axles. The central part of the body, -with the door, is brought down very low, affording easy access ; and the box and driving seat, instead of being detached from the body, form one mass with it. Leather splashers are placed on each side of the door to defend the passengers from the dirt of the wheels. This car- riage has usually a head to throw up, and may be open, or furnished with a glass and frame in the manner of the britzschka. 6652. The pilentum landau, fig. 870., is another carriage by Mr. Davies, on the same principle, on elliptic springs, and the centre of the body brought low. 6053. Fig. 871. is the construction called a Clarence.

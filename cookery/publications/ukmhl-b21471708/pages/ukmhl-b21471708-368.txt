HOUSEHOLD CLEANING. Sect. I. GENERAL HOUSEHOLD CLEANING. Sdbsect. 1. — General Observations. 1600. Cleanliness, whether household or personal, may be considered as one of the unalloyed advantages derived from civilisation. If it may not be ranked as a vii-tue, it is at least the parent of virtues, and not unadvisedly was the old saying first pronoimced, " Cleanliness is next to Godliness." 1601. As a habit, it has moral as well as physical advantages, personal as well as domestic ; hence its claims on our approbation and daily observance. It evinces an absence of slothfulness; for without activity and exertion, cleanliness cannot be practised: it is ah emblem, if not a characteristic, of purity of thought and propriety of conduct. It seems as if it could not be associated with vicious pursuits ; so rarely, in the habitually profligate character, are the active and wholesome habits of cleanliness perceptible. The squalid wretchedness, which sometimes engages the pity of the philanthropist, is ofteuer found, on investigation, to be the effect of vicious idleness rather than of unmerited misfortune ; while cleanliness, if it cannot totally indemnify us from the evils of poverty and disease, can keep them far removed from utter wretchedness and miseiy. Cleanliness is an unequivocal good; and accordingly we find that it confers a species of rank on all its votaries, to whatever class in the scale of society they may belong. The cleanly family, whether living in the cottage or the hall, is " respectable" " creditable,"— a distinction which serves as capital or stock in trade to members of the industrious work- ing class, and is not without its value in the higher walks of life, where honour and dis- tinction are sought. 1G02. In the former class, the respectability of a family (and we can scarcely allow respectability to be claimed where cleanliness does fiot prevail) is a sufficient recommenda- tion to honest and creditable emj>loyments. An opposite term, given to an idle slovenly family, would be an equal impediment to the worldly advancement and welfare of its members. Doubt and suspicion must inevitably cloud the prospects of all whose domestic habits could not promise for them, that, in the world, when called upon to act, they would be diligent and energetic, not self-indulgent or wanting in attention to any of the proprieties of life. 1G0.3. We shall fust consider cleanliness in the house, together with the modes of cleaning everything within its walls. Attention to the person will be treated of elsewhere. Under the head of "Ventilation," we have treated of the importauce of preserving the purity of the air in our houses, and of those causes which deteriorate, among which the want of clean- liness is one of the chief. 1604. Whatever may be the exciting causes of infectious diseases, cleanliness has in its keeping the specific by which their progress is checked. Under its influence infectious

242 ON HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE. Book V. originally an eastern fashion, probably taken from the divan, -which is a part of tha floor raised a little above the rest in Turkish and Persian houses, and having a continued seat along the wall covered with mattresses about three feet -wide. Persons of distinction have this seat covered with scarlet cloth, silk, or other rich stuffs; and there are likewise pillows stuffed w ith cotton, and covered with similar stuffs, to lean upon. As it is not the custom in these countries to use chairs, it is upon these they sit. It may be interesting to remark by the way, that although the custom we have mentioned is still general, yet we are informed by Mr. Spencer, the late traveller, that some of the Turkish grandees are beginning to evince a preference for European customs and furniture ; and instead of sitting on the ground and eating only with their fingers, are now making use of tables, chairs, knives, forks, and spoons, and furnishing their apartments with costly looking glasses, chiffoniers, secretaires, chests of drawers, &c.; and he suggests, as a profitable speculation, sending cargoes of furniture to Constantinople, and other large Turkish towns. Sofas with us are usually made of mahogany enriched with carving, and covered with hair cloth, chintz, or silk. Fig, 255. is a drawing room sofa in the Grecian style. Fig. 256. is a couch sofa, which is somewhat less expensive ; and fig. 257. is one in the antique style, where a leopard's skin is used as a cover.

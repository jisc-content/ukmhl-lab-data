ON HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE. Book V. 266 1191. Fig. 398. is an example of a four-post bedstead in the Elizabethan style. The whole is of oak, ceiling and head 1 n oA 0 1 included, -which are pannelled and enriched with carving. The curtains are omitted to shew the design better. 1192. French beds are remarkable for their variet)' of forms, and the taste which they admit of displaying. The cottage French pole-bed,399., is of very simple construction, and is now much usqd in this country as an economical piece of furniture. One of its great conveniences is the man- ner in which the curtain is contrived. This consists merely of a piece of drapery thrown over a pole which is generally fixed to the wall at the place where the bed is to stand ; it can be taken down with the utmost facility, and the usual expense of making up attending other curtains is here saved. In places where the pole cannot be Fig. 398. conveniently fixed to the wall, it may be attached to an upright piece forming part of the bed, as In the wood cut. Fig. 400. shows the bed, with the furniture and bedding complete. Some object to the curtain reaching so low at the head; in consequence of which one cannot well sit upright in bed, and the air is too much confined near the face. This inconvenience may be removed by hanging the curtains as in fig. 401., though by the sacrifice of some uni- formity. Many persons use them without curtains, and in small rooms they are better without; particularly for young people. Their being easily moved, and taken to pieces, is one of â– their principal advantages. The cur- tains are certainly more elegant than those of the tent bed.y?^. 405., and less apt to collect dust; but they are not so convenient, as those of tent beds may be, if hung with rings upon a rod at the top of the upright posts in fig. 406., which will open by drawing aside. They are usually painted in imitation of some expensive wood.

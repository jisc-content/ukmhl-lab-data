850 GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A KITCHEN. Book XL 4805. Fig. 745. represents a sink in the scullery, -with pipes and cocks for hot and cold water, with a plate-rack over it: the tubs for hog-wash are placed beneath. 4806. Fig. 746. is a potato drainer to lay potatoes on to drain after they are washed. A grating below carries away the wet. CHAP. V. EXAMPLES OF VAKIOUS KITCHEN FIRE-PLACES. 4808. It may be useful, in illustration of what we have said, to give some examples of kitchen fire-places which have been fitted up and found convenient. 4809. Fig. 748. represents one of the smallest size ranges, the fire-bars one foot six inches in length. On one side is an oven heated by the fire; and on the other side is a boiler, also extending behind the back of the fire, with a cock to draw off the water. The boiler may either be filled every day by the circular cover on the top, or, what is better, it may be fed by a cistern and a ball-cock, as represented by the dotted lines. This boiler may likewise furnish steam to the two tin steam vessels, a and b, placed over the cistern. The pipe which supplies the steam is indicated by the curved dotted line- The throat of this chimney should be made narrow, and the inside may be lined with Dutch or white delftwarc tiles, which gives a very clean and neat appearance. 4810. Fig. 749. is another arrangement on a larger scale. In the kitchen chimney there is the usual range, with an oven on one side and a boiler on the other. Connected with the last, on the right, is a set of steamers, and a hot closet beneath heated by the steam.

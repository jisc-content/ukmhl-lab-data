The last article, " On Health," wiU, no doubt, be found to convey valuable information in aid of professional assistance. To treat so many subjects with the necessary care, and within a limited space, has demanded considerable research, great caution in balancing opinions, and much industry in forming the heterogeneous mass of ma- terials of which the work is composed into one compact body.

He may add, that all the woodcuts have been executed from drawings made by himself, mostly from original objects.

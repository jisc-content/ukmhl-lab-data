GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A KITCHEN. Fig. 633. represents the kitchen fire-place at the City of London Chib House in Broad Street. Here there is one of the largest chass of ranges, with a back boiler, and a smoke jack which turns six spits occasionally, a, the fan wheel of the smoke jack, in dotted lines, is behind the chimney breast in the flue of the chimney; h is a box inclosing two bevel wheels, one horizontal on the axis of the fan, and connected with another one vertical, the axis of which comes through the chimney breast, and has on it another vertical wheel, c, the latter turning two bevel wheels, d and c, which are fixed on the long axis f (/ that extends across the chimney, and which, of course, is made to revolve. On both ends of this axis is a grooved cylinder, in the grooves of which are chains to go down to the grooves of the wheels attached to the spits. In the woodcut, two only of the chains are represented in action: the rest are only partly shown hanging down perpen- dicularly, to prevent crowding the figure. Besides these parts, there is on the same axis f g. two more bevel wheels, h and which turn two smaller ones, k and /, the axes of which are vertical, and have on them universal joints, m and n. These last are called by the cooks danglers, and their use is to turn, by means of another wire and hook, any smaller articles that may require to be roasted, and for which spitting may not be convenient: the motion of these, of course, will be vertical, as when meat hangs by a string or bottle

[ 90 ] JUL JUM Saline Julep is a mixtui'e of 3 drachms of purified potash and ^ lb. of water; to which are to be added 1 oz. of the syrup of black currants and ^ lb. of lemon juice, or such a quantity of the latter as will be sufficient to saturate the alkali. This compound is often used in febrile diseases by taking two or three table-spoonsful eveiy hour, in order to promote a slight per- spiration. It also increases the secretion of urine, and is frequently employed to restrain vomiting. Vomiting Jolep. Dissolve 4 grains of emetic tartar in 8 ozs. of water, and add to it ^ oz. of the syrup of clove gillyflowers. In the begin- ning of fevers, where there is no topical inflammation, this julep may be given in the dose of one table-spoonful every quarter of an hour till it operates. Antimonial vomits serve not only to evacuate the contents of the stomach, but likewise to promote the different excretions. Hence they are found in fevers to have nearly the same effects as Dr. James's powder. JULIENNE. This soup is composed of carrots, turnips, leeks, onions, celery, lettuce, sorrel, and chervil. The roots are cut in thin slips about an inch long; the onions are halved, and then sliced ; the lettuce and sorrel chopped small. Toss up the roots in a little butter, and when they are done add the lettuce, &c. moisten them with broth, and boil the whole over a slow fire for an hour or more if necessary. Prepare some bread in the usual way, and pour the Julienne over it. JULY. Provisions for domestic consumption now in use are: â€” Fish.

If you have no rose water substitute six or seven drops of strong essence of lemon, or more if the essence is weak. Stir the whole very hard with a knife. Spread some flour on your pasteboard, and flour your hands well; take up with your knife a portion of the dough, and lay it on the board ; roll it lightly with your hands into long thin rolls, which must be cut into equal lengths, curled up in rings, and laid gently in an iron or tin pan, buttered, not too close to each other, as they spread in baking. Bake them in a quick oven about five minutes, and grate loaf sugar over them when cool. The top of the oven may be neai'ly red-hot, otherwise the jumbles will run into each other, and become flat and shapeless. JUMBLES, COMMON.

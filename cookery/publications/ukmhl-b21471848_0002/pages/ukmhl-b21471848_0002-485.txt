There is also some pro- tuberance externally perceptible, and fever, as in other internal local inflammations. The causes are such as external injury. This may be known from inflammation of the lungs by the seat of the disorder; also by the throbbing pain increased on pressure, and by the breathing not being aflfected. Though the disease is, for the most part, easily removed, should an abscess form, which it will sometimes do without much previous painful sensation, this, suddenly burst- ing, pours out its contents among tlie intestines, and destroys the person afflicted. Â« The spleen, like the liver, is occasionally subject to chronic pain, requiring nutritious diet, mild temperature, and exercise propor- tioned to the strengtli; also the suitable in- fluence of objects acting on the organs of sense, and of such as excite the mind. Its other remedies are alteratives and corroborants. SPONGrB, in the state in which it is met with in commerce, is a soft, light, elastic, and very porous substance, which readily absorbs liquids into which it is immersed, and yields them up again on compression. It may bo considered as the skeleton of an animal, fi'om which the soft gelatinous part representing the flesh has been removed at the time of its col- lection. In the living state it is found attached by its base to rocks at the bottom of tlie sea. It occurs in the Indian, American, and Nor- wegian seas, and the Mediterranean. The best sponges are brought from the Grrecian Archi- pelago, and are called Turkey sponges. An inferior kind is brought from the West Indies, and is called West India or Bahama sponge. Sponge is extensively used for various domestic purposes : the ashes resulting from its combus- tion in close vessels have also been used in medicine, on account of a small portion of iodine which they contain. 8ee Chakcoal. Sponge is of extensive utility in domestic economy, medicine, and surgery. If it be cut in small pieces, fried or dipped in honey, and given to mice, it distends their intestines, and effectually destroys them. As it strongly ad- heres to the orifices of wounded vessels, it is advantageously employed as a styptic, often preventing the effusion of blood more effectually than the puff-ball or agaric. To bleach sponge, soak it in very dilute muriatic acid to remove calcareous matter, then in cold water, changing it frequently, and squeezing the sponge out each time; next soak it in water holding a little sulphuric or sulphurous acid, or chlorine in solution, changing the acid frequently till the sponge is sufiiciently bleached. Lastly, repeatedly wash and soak in clean water, and scent with rose or orange-flower water. SPONGE CAKE. See Cake, Sponge. SPEAIN. This is a violent twisting, and sometimes tearing, of the tendons of a joint. The wrists, ankles, and knees are most liable to it. In the treatment of sprains two circum- stances are necessary to be attended to: firstly, to check the swelling; and secondly, to use the best means for removing inflammation. For the first purpose astringent applications, such as vinegar, ardent spirits, lees of wine, &c., may

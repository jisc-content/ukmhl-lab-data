[ 478 ] S YL TAF tiiste, and pain at the pit of the stomach, a gen- tle emetic may be given, with copious dratights of warm camomile tea : the same means may be adopted in cases of surfeit. Persons of plethoric habit, when fainting from violence of passion, ought immediately to lose a few ounces of blood from the arm, and afterwards take a copious aperient; for instance, infusion of senna, tama- rinds with manna, salts', &c. If swooning arise from excess of pain, benefit may be derived from opium; and when it is occasioned by sudden fright or a fit of terror, blood-letting, followed by small doses of laudanum and antiraonial wine (from 5 to 10 drops of the former, and double that quantity of the latter), will tend to compose the nerves and promote perspiration. When the fit of swooning is the effect of too violent emetics or aperients, a few drops of the tincture of opium, in conjunction with aromatic wine, will form the most proper remedy. In cases of great debility it will be necessary to abstain from all stimulating food and drink, aud to use the mildest astringents, in combina- tion with a bland and nourishing diet. During the paroxysm frictions of the extremities with hot flannels will gi'eatly assist the recovery of the patient.â€”(Magazine of Domestic Economy.) SYLLABUB (i).

MEA MEA [ 201 ] hereby declared to be the imperial standard yard, when compared with a pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time in the latitude of London, in a vacuum at the level of the sea, is in the proportion of thirty-six inches to thirty-nine inches and one thousand three hundred and ninety-three ten-thousandth parts of an inch (36 : 39'1393); be it therefore enacted and de- clared, that if at any time hereafter the said imperial standard yard shall be lost, or shall be in any manner destroyed, defaced, or otherwise injured, it shall and may be restored by making, under the direction of the Lord High Treasurer, or the Commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or any three of them, for the time being, a new standard yard, beai'ing the same proportion to such pendulum as aforesaid, as the said imperial standard yard bears to such peudulum. " And be it further enacted, that from and after the first day of May, 1825, the standard measure of capacity, as well for liquids as for dry goods not measured by heaped measure, shall be the gallon, containing ten pounds avoirdupois weight of distilled water weighed in air, at the temperature of 62° Fahr., the barometer being at thirty inches ; and that a measure shall be forthwith made of brass, of such contents as aforesaid, under the directions of the Lord High Treasurer, or the Commis- sioners of his Majesty's Treasury of the United Kingdom, or any three or more of them, for the time being; and such brass measure shall be, and is hereby declared to be, the imperial standard gallon, and shall be, and is hereby declared to be, the unit and only standard measure of capacity, from which all other measures of capacity to be used, as well for wine, beer, ale, spirits, and all sorts of liquids, as for dry goods not measured by heaped mea- sure, shall be derived, computed, and ascer- tained ; and that all measures shall be taken in parts or multiples, or certain proportions of the said imperial standard gallon; and that the quart shall be the fourth part of such standard gallon, and the pint shall be one-eighth of such standard gallon, and that two such gallons shall be a peck, and eight such gallons shall be a bushel, and eight such bushels a quarter of corn or other dry goods not measured by heaped measure." And by the act passed in September, 1835 fSth & 6th William IV. cap 63), it is enacted, " That from and after the passing of this act the measuie called the Winchester bushel, and the lineal measure called the Scotch ell, and all local or customary measures, shall be abo- lished ; and every person who shall sell by any denomination of measure other than one of the imperial measures, or some multiple, or some aliquot part, such as half, the quarter, the eighth, the sixteenth, or the thirty-second parts thereof, shall, on conviction, be liable to a penalty not exceeding the sum of forty shillings for every such sale: provided always that nothing herein contained shall prevent the sale of any articles in any vessel, where such vessel is not represented as containing any amount of imperial measure, or of any fixed, local, or customary measure heretofore in use." In the adoption of the new imperial measure there is no exception made for medicines, as in the case of weights; and the use of any other than the imperial measure is, therefore, illegal in the sale of these as well as every other article of commerce.

Take the fore-quarter of a pig about six weeks old, skin and truss it as a fore-quarter of lamb, floiir it, sprinkle it over with a little salt, and send it to table nicely frothed. W^ith mint sauce or salad it will eat like lamb. When it comes to table cut off the shoulder, and squeeze the juice of a Seville orange over it. The hind- quarter of it is very good roasted in the same wav. PIG EN GELATINE.

When quite clean off wash it well with warm water, and afterwards in two or three cold waters, that no flavour of the resin may remain. Take off all the feet at the first joint, make a slit down the belly, and tal^e out the entrails ; put the liver, heart, and lights to the feet.

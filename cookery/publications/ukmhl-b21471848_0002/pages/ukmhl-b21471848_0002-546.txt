VAL TAR [ 520 ] putting away the razors, and everything which has been used in its proper place. For wet weather, when his master may come in from riding, the valet should be always pre- pared, by having ready the necessary changes of linen and clothing, and by being himself in waiting to remove the damp clothing, and to prevent its being injured in the drying. I3efore putting damp woollen clothing to the fire it should be rubbed with a sponge, the way of the nap, until the smoothness of the surface is restored. If dried without this precaution, brushing will not be effectual in removing the i"oughness. In preparing for journeys the valet should endeavour to ascertain the probable time of his master's absence that he may be able to provide a sufficiency of linen and other clothing. At the inns he takes charge of these supplies, and, as at home, places everything in readiness for the periods of dressing and undi-essing. Besides this, if his master be unattended by his foot- man, it is his duty to attend to his accommodation generally, as well as in his dressing-room. Whenever his master needs his services he must be at hand ; even at table, if more than ordinary attendance be required, he must be ready to wait. VALETUDINARIANS. In acute diseases, notwithstanding the doctrines to the contrary, rest is absolutely necessai-y; but when sickly people get into a state of convalescence, exer- cise, under a proper system, is essential for their recover}'. They are apt, however, to be alarmed at the pain and inconvenience which often accompany their tirst attempts to take exercise, at least to any extent. They ouglit, therefore, to desist as soon as they begin to find themselves fatigued; but every day they will feel enabled to bear it longer, and the more they persevere the stronger they will become. Gentle exercise and good air afford such sur- prising relief to convalescents, that their friends and medical advisers ought to insist on a trial being made, disregarding all objections to the con- trary, which the languid state of their mind and body may occasion. Exercise in a cot or ham- mock, when the patient is exceedingly weak, by swinging it from side to side, will afford an excellent substitute when other means are not attainable. When invalids return from exer- cising, should they find themselves chilled by the cold air, they ought, instead of warming themselves by the fire, to sit down, well clothed, in a remote part of the room until their feelings are gradually reconciled to the temperature of the place they are in. - By adopting this pre- caution all the hazard of rushing from one extreme to another may be avoided. Not a day should be allowed to pass without taking a certain degree of exercise, accommo- dated to individual strengtli. And as few per- sons, more especially invalids, can long enjoy health under a state of indolence, the latter, wh(!n confined at home by bad weather, should adopt some kind of active domestic exercise like that of shuttlecock, or any similar amuse- ment, several times in a well-ventilated room, taking care, however, to avoid the draught of air. This will be found a more salutary mode of warming the body than by the heat of fires. VANILLA CREAM.

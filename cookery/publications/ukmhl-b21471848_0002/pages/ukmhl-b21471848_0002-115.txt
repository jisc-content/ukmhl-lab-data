KIDNEY OMELET. Take a fine kidney from a cold roasted loin of veal, mince and soak it well in some cream, break seven or eight eggs on it, and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; beat the whole with a whisk, and fry your omelet, taking care to keep it pretty thick. KIDNEY PASTY. Roast a loin of veal, and when it is almost done take the kidney, the fat, and some of the meat, and mince it small, with the marrow of half a dozen cold veal marrow bones; season with marjoram, thyme, and winter savory cut small or pounded, a quarter of a pint of rose water, the yolks of six eggs, a little nutmeg sliced, ^ lb. of sugar, and ^ lb. of cur- rants.

KIDNEYS. Cut them through the long way, score them, and sprinkle them over with a very little pepper and salt. In order to broil all over alike, and to keep them from curling on i the gridiron, run a wire skewer right through them. They must be broiled over a clear fire, being careful to turn them frequently till they are done. They will take about ten or twelve minutes to broil, provided they are done over a brisk fire; or if you choose you may fry them in butter, and make gravy for them in the pan by putting in a tea-spoonful of flour. As soon as it looks brown put in a sufficient quantity of water as will make gravy. They -will take five minutes longer frying than broiling. Garnish with fried parsley.

LAMB, LEG OF : To Force. Take a leg of lamb, and with a sharp knife cut out all the meat, but leave the skin whole, and the fat upon it. Make the meat you cut out into the follow- ing forcemeat:â€”To 2 lbs. of meat put 2 lbs. of beef suet finely chopped; take away all the skin and suet from the meat, and mix it with four spoonsful of grated bread, eight or ten cloves, five or six large blades of mace dried and finely beaten, half a large nuttoeg grated, a little pepper and salt, some lemon-peel cut finely, a very little thyme, some parsley, and four eggs. Mix all these together, and put it into the skin ; make it as nearly as you can into the same shape it was before, sew it up, and roast it, basting it well with butter. Cut the loin into steaks, and nicely fry them ; lay the leg on the dish, and the steaks cut from tlie loin round it, with stewed cauliflowers all round upon the steaks ; pour a pint of good gravy into the dish, and then serve. ; LAMB, LEG OF (Boiled). It should be boiled in a cloth, that it may look as white as possible. Cut the loin into steaks, dip them in egg, strew them over with bread crumbs, and fry them a nice brown.

Put this into 1 the remainder of the leg, draw the skin over, and j roll it up in the form of a sausage; wrap it in a cloth, tie it tightly, and boil it in stock, with half a pint of white wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a few carrots and onions sliced. When done serve it with any sauce you please. LAMB, LEG OF (Stewed with Peas). Take a leg of house lamb, and stew it in some stock or beef braise. When nicely done take it out, put it in a slow oven, and glaze it three or four times ; then have some nice young peas, well stewed with some good bechamel sauce; pour them on the dish, lay the leg on the top, cut the loin into cutlets, and do them on the fire with some butter and strong gravy. When nearly done shake them well in their glaze, dish round the lamb over the peas, and serve them hot to table. LAMB, LIVER OF. Have ready two lambs' plucks, cut the lights into dice, the liver into thin slices, and fry them lightly over a small fire in butter. They should be scarcely more than browned.

Let the whole stew over a slow fire, moistening with stock; and when done skim the fat from the sauce, pass it through a sieve, place the loin on a dish with the truffles, and pour the sauce over.

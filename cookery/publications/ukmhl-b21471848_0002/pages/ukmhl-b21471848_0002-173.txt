The enormous cost of the French, German, Dutch, and Italian liqueurs, not only in this country, but in every other, renders their being prepared in a cheap form a most desirable thing. As an agreeable ter- mination to a repast, and at the same time a gentle and wholesome stimulus, that induces the stomach to perform its digestive functions more kindly, these liqueurs are in great request among the wealthy; but from the excessive price at which they are sold the less affluent classes are debarred from their use, and obliged to resort to the gin or brandy bottle, the contents of which are taken either in the form of a dram or mixed with hot water and sugar, the water being used very sparingly. The particular effect looked to from the use of these cordial preparations is a gentle action of the stomach, and nothing more. They are, therefore, to be taken sparingly. Hence the object of having a very small glass, which contains a sufficient dose to prove beneficial. Brandy, gin, or any other spirit, being almost, perhaps quite, as strong as the liqueurs, is always taken in too great quantities to do good, and is, besides, devoid of the agreeable perfume which gives such a relish to the liqueur, and makes it grateful to the palate. Let us not, however, be understood to say that the use of liqueurs ought to explode that of wine. On the contrary, one must co-operate with the other. A small glass of liqueur is no bad winding up to three or four glasses of port or sherry, though it would do just as much good as if no wine at all had been drunk. But the practice of taking spirit and water as a sub- stitute for wine is bad, because, unless the mixture be very weak, the spirit excites the stomach to a very injurious degree, and impedes, instead of aiding the digestion. In all foreign countries the liqueur is used as a chasse cafe. being taken immediately after the small cup of very strong coffee with which every foreign dinner concludes. Neither the French, nor the Germans, nor the Italians sit sotting after din- ner as we Englishmen do after the ladies have left the table. Abroad that odious practice of turning the ladies out of the dining-room is unknown. Ladies and gentlemen all rise after the dessert has been partaken of, and if the coffee and liqueur are not taken at the dinner- table, which they usually are, retire together to the drawing-room, and take them there. Such a practice, were it adopted here, would be found far preferable to the besotted habits

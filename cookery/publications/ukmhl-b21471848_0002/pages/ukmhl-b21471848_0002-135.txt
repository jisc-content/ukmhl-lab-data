Fry them of the nicest brown, and when served throw over them a good quantity of crumbs of bread fried, and crisped parsley.; or you may season and broil them in buttered papers, either with crumbs and herbs, or without, according to LAMB SWEETBREADS (1). These parts of lamb are generally dressed the same as veal sweetbreads. The following, however, belongs rather to those of lamb:â€”Butter a saucepan, and put in the sweetbreads, and two spoonsful of jelly; cover them with a buttered paper, put fire above and below, and stew them thus for half an hour; then serve them with a puree of fowls or endive, or any other sauce you think proper. LAMB SWEETBREADS (2). Blanch your sweetbreads, and put them into cold water for a little while ; then put them into a stewpan, with a ladleful of stock, some pepper, salt, a small bunch of young onions, and a blade of mace; stir in a bit of butter, with some flour, and stew half an hour.

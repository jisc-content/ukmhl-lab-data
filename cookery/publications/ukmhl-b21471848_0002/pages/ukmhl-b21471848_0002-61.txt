It may be necessary that we should live in one particular neighbourhood or town, and some- times it is important to establish ourselves in one particular situation; therefore we must overlook many disadvantages, and forego many things that we fancy essential to our comfort. On these points the disposition and temper are much concerned; in fact, they have more to do with them and with everything than people are at all aware of, A worldly-minded person, or one who has a grumbling, dissatisfied temper, will find difficulties, annoyances, and objections in almost everything, while a cheerful, thankful t spirit will see all things that cannot be avoided in a pleasant light, and turn to good account what others would mourn over in despair. It is impossible to meet with everj'- thing we want and like combined. We may spend day after day in seeking for something upon which we have set our mind, and ever finding that something connected with dis- agreeables which are of more real moment than itself. Situation, however, should be as much as possible considered, because it has much to do with health. A low situation is seldom healthy, especially in towns, and this should be avoided if there is a possibility of doing so.

[ 549 ] WAL WAF both sides equally brown. When done sprinkle them with powder sugar (and cinnamon if you like), and serve them up. Be careful, in taking out the paste to fill the pan, not to disturb or plunge the spoon into the prepai-ation: the upper part of the paste should be taken off very gently, and the spoon laid across the top of the vessel. If these precautions be not attended to, the good appearance of the wafers will be destroyed. WAFERS, ITALIAN. Take eight eggs, 14ozs. of powder sugar, I lb. of flour, 6 ozs. of cream, the same of milk, 1 oz. of orange flowers, and the rind of a lemon grated. Beat the eggs with the sugar and flour first; then add the cream, milk, and other materials by degrees ; mix them well, and take care there are not the slightest lumps. Make the wafers as already directed. WAFERS, WINE. Make a paste of a proper thickness of wine, flour, sugar, and eggs, and finish as above. When they are coloured a delicate pink, and the cream kept as white as possible by making them of white of egg and lemon juice, they make a beautiful dish mixed, They are also excellent filled with whipped cream the moment of serving, as meringues. They may likewise be meringued and varied with different essences, or pearled with sugar. WAGES. (See Domestic Servants, Female Servants, Butler, &c.)

WAKEFULNESS ought not to be pro- longed beyond a proper time, as it exhausts the vital spirits, disorders the nerves, and unhinges the whole system: hence acute headaches, vertigoes, &c., are the inevitable consequences, because the whole mass of the fluids becomes vitiated, and the animal frame is at length subject to an uncommon degree of irritability and excitement on the slightest occasions. In the present artificial state of society many persons of active minds and great suscepti- bility complain of watchfulness, which shortens their days, renders their life unhappy, and is sometimes succeeded by insanity. As the source of this malady may, in general, be at- tributed to an unbounded desire of acquiring wealth, power, or fame, we shall briefly remark that moral arguments will mostly prove un- availing where the primary education has been defective. Instead, therefore, of resorting to opium, spirits, or other stupefying liquors, we advise such unfortunate victims of a disordered imagination to adopt a more frugal mode of life, to take sufficient bodily exercise, not to indulge in nocturnal speculations, and, if these means be ineff"ectual, to resort either to the tepid bath, or to employ general friction over the whole body for at least half an hour previously to their repose. Putting the feet into very hot water at bedtime will often induce sleep. WALKING. See Exercise. WALLS. See Damp. WALNUT KETCHUP (]). Thoroughly bruise one hundred and twenty small green walnuts ; put to them | lb. ©f salt and a quart of good wine vinegar, and stir them every day for a fortnight; then strain and squeeze the liquor from them through a cloth, and add to it oz. of whole black pepper, forty cloves, ^ oz. of nutmeg bruised or sliced, 1 oz. of ginger, and 5 drachms of mace, and boil it for half an hour ; then strain it from the spices, and bottle it for use. See Ketchup, Walnut. WALNUT KETCHUP (2). Take six half- sieves of green walnut shells, put them into a tub, mix them up well with common salt (from 2 lbs. to 3 lbs.), and let them stand for six days, frequently heating and mashing them. By this time the shells become soft and pulpy; then by banking them up on one side of the tub, and at the same time raising the tub on that side, the liquor will drain off clear to the other; then take that liquor out: the mashing and banking up may be repeated as often as liquor is found. The quantity will be about six quarts. When done let it be simmered in an iron boiler as long as any scum rises; then bruise J lb. of ginger, ^ lb. of allspice, 2 ozs. of long pepper, and 2 ozs. of cloves, with the above ingredients, and let them slowly boil for half an hour. When bottled let an equal quantity of the spice go

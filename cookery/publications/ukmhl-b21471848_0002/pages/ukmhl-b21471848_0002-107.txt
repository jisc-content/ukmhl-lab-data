Make a wine or calfs- foot jelly, with which half fill the mould. When thoroughly set take some Italian cream that has been turned out of a plain mould, cut it into slices, and afterwards cut it with a middling-sized round cutter; lay these pieces of cream in a circle round your jelly, and when all are arranged put in very gently enough jelly to cover them.

JELLY - MAKING.- {See Calf's-Feet Jelly.) The mechanical precautions necessary are to strain the jelly while hot through a bag shaped like the letter V. The bag must be kept before a fire, to preserve the jelly in a liquid state during the straining. The bag is to be made of flannel, and kept open at the mouth by a small loop. j To get the jelly, when cold, unbroken out of i the moulds into which it has been pouref^, requires somewhat different treatment according i to the material of which it is made. A jelly ; mould may be made either of common tin, ! block tin, or of white earthen or stone ware. If of one or other of the two first-mentioned materials, before the jelly is turned out the outer surface of the mould should be rapidly wiped with a napkin dipped in hot water; if the mould is of earthenware it should itself be dipped for an instant up to the edges in hot i water. The jelly will then turn out well, pro- vided it be well set, cold, and stiff. JELLY, MULLED.

Take about 10 lbs. of ice, break it up, put it into a tub or pail, in which immerse the mould for three hours; then take out the mould, dip it into hot water as quickly as possible, and turn the jelly into a dish for table. JELLY PUFFS. Take a broad pan, and put into it a pint of rich milk and ^ lb. of the best fresh butter. Cut up the butter in the milk, and if in cold weather set it in a warm place on the stove, or on the hearth near the fire, till the butter is quite soft, but do not allow it to melt or oilâ€”it must be merely warmed so as to soften; then take it off, anl with a knife stir the butter well through tha milk till thoroughly mixed. Have ready J lb. of fine flour sifted into a deep dish. In a broad pan beat eight eggs with a whisk till they are very light and thick; then stir the beaten egg into the pan of milk and butter in turn with the sifted flour, a little at a time of each. Stir the whole very hard, and then put the mixture into buttered tea-cups, filling them only two-thirds. Set them immediately into a brisk oven, and bake them twenty minutes or more, till they are well browned and puffed up lightly; then take them from the oven, and with a knife open a slit in the side of each puff, and cirefully put in with a spoon sufficient fruit jelly or marmalade to fill up the inside or cavity; afterwards close the slit, and press it together with your fingers. As you fill the puffi lay each on a large dish, and before they go to table sift powder sugar over them. Eat them cold. If properly made they will be found delicious. JELLY, RESTORATIVE.

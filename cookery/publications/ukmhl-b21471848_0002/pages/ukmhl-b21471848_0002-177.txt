LIVER SAUSAGE. Take four lambs'livers, with the lights and heart; have two lambs' heads cleaned, and boil them with any scraps or skinny pieces you have; skim the pot, take out the livers when they are done, and let the heads boil longer. When they are done pick out the bones, and chop all up together; season with sage, thymÂ«, sweet marjoram, salt, and pepper; put it m pans, and fry it as sausage. LIVER STOCK. Fresh livers of old cattle give the highest-flavoured and strongest stock, which is excellent. Wash and wipe the liver before cutting it into thin slices; put it inta a broad frying-pan, with butter or rendered beef suet, and fry it slowly of a deep brown. If a great deal of colour is wanted dust it with fl^our, but do not let it harden much.

When the mushrooms and livers are well drained boil them in the same sauce, skim off the fat, ar d serve them up hot. LIVERS AU RAGOtT. Take the liver of a turkey and the livers of half a dozen fowls, clean them, and take the greatest care not to break the galls, for if the livers are bitter the dish will be spoiled. Put them into cold water, and then put the livers of the fowls into a stewpan, with rather more than a quarter of a pint of gravy, a spoonful of catsup, a spoonful of pickled mushrooms, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and some salt and pepper. Stew them gently ten or twelve minutes. Nicely broil the turkey's liver, lay it in the middle of the dish, place the stewed liver round it, and pour the sauce over. LIVERS, TOQRTE OF.

Half a pint of cream slightly warmed, with a table-spoonful of vinegar and a tea-spoon- ful of dissolved saleratus, should be stirred in just as you are ready to bake it; also sifted flour enough to make it of a proper consistence.

196 Food and Feeding. Vegetable produce. Bread. Much more unsatisfactory is the supply of vegetable and dairy produce to our great city, particularly of the former. It must he confessed that our market at Covent Garden, in relation to capabilities for effective distribution of fresh vegetables, &c., would disgrace a town one-fifth of the size of London. Nineteen- twentieths of its inhabitants cannot obtain fresh green food on any terms, and those who succeed pay an exorbitant price. But their success is only partial, as those few who have a country garden of their own, and are supplied by it, well know. And, compara- tively speaking, none but those who are so happily circumstanced, realize the exceeding luxury of pos- sessing well-grown vegetables brought directly from the garden to the table. Again, I think I am right in saying that a really new-laid egg is a luxury which only a few in London can insure by purchase. Who- ever would absolutely secure the luxury must keep fowls, and with due care may obtain it, not otherwise. The great staple of our bread, commonly called “ bakers’ bread,” is unpalatable and indigestible; and I suppose no thoughtful or prudent consumer would, unless compelled, eat it habitually—used as it nevertheless is by the great majority of the inhabi- tants of this great city—any more than he would select a steak from the coarse beef whose proper destination is the stock-pot. Let any one com- pare the facilities which exist in most foreign towns for obtaining the important articles of diet just named, with the modes of supply afforded in London* and the inferiority of the latter will be so

Sweet Drinks at Dinner objectionable. 169 and a thin cutting of the peel, form sometimes an agreeable addition, especially to our well-made soda, seltzer or potash waters ; and nothing keeps the palate cleaner or in better order for appreciating food. I am compelled to say that the sweet compounds and but none fruity juices which have for some time past been fit produced, and inordinately puffed, as dinner drinks, for dinner and apparently in competition with wine, are rarely wholesome adjuncts to a dinner. Such liquids rapidly develop indigestible acid products in the stomachs of many persons ; while for all, the sipping of sweet fluids, effervescing or otherwise, during a meal tends to diminish appetite, as well as the faculty of appreciating good cookery. If wine is refused, let the drink which accompanies dinner be of pure water—with a sparkle of gas in it, and a slight acid in it if you will—but in obedience both to gastro- nomic and dietetic laws let it be free from sugar. No doubt there are exceptional circumstances in which fruity juices, if not very sweet, can be taken freely. Thus I have rarely quaffed more delicious liquor at The water- dinner in the warm autumn of southern Europe, ^ notably in Spain, than that afforded by ample slices of hot coun- a water-melon, which fill the mouth with cool fragranttries’ liquid; so slight is the amount of solid matter, that it only just serves to contain the abundant delicate juices of the fruit grown in those climates. Here the sac- charine matter is nevertheless present, only in very small proportion. z

First, however, the surface of the fish is to be lightly spread with butter, and a morsel or two added round it; the whole is then to be placed in a Dutch or American oven, in front of a clear fire.* The advantages of this method are, that the fish is cooked entirely in its own juices, which are abundant, and form the best sauce, and that these juices which contain part of the nutriment and much of the charac- teristic flavour are saved and utilised; lastly, the direct action of the fire browning the surface of the fish, gives that appetising flavour which is the especial charm of the “ roast ” and the “ grill,” and which is known to appreciative palates as “tasting of the fire.” In fact, the proper term for denoting the method described, is that of “ roasting,” for the fish is literally roasted before the fire, and basted in its own gravy; and with the same advantage in result as that which roasted meat possesses by universal consent over that which is baked in an oven. It is necessary to guard against over-roasting so as to dry the fish and evaporate the gravy ; and if through carelessness this condition has * Mr. W. Burton, some time ago of Oxford Street, made for me an oven and dishes expressly for the purpose of cooking fish before the fire. The oven is a modification of that known as the “ American, ” being rather deeper, from before backwards, and much shallower, from above downwards, on account of the flat form of fish not occupying the space which is required by joints of meat,

Food in the tropics. The East. In South ern Europe. Italy. Food and Feeding. <-> the life and labour of the chief part of the worldâ€™s population. In the tropics and adjacent portions of the temperate zones, high temperature being incompatible with the physical activity familiar to northern races, a very little nitrogenous material suffices, since the expendi- ture is small. Only a moderate quantity of fat is taken, the demand for heat and for force being incon- siderable. The chiefly starchy products supply nearly all the nutriment required, and such are found in rice, millet, &c. Rice by itself is the principal food of the wide zone thus indicated, including a large part of China, the East Indies, part of Africa and America, and also the West Indies. Small additions, where obtainable, are made of other seeds, of oil, butter, &c.; and as temperature decreases by distance from the equator, some fish, fowl, or other light form of animal food, are added. In the north of Africa, Arabia, and some neigh- bouring parts, the date, which contains sugar in abundance, is largely eaten, as well as maize and other cereals. Crossing to Europe, the southern Italian is found subsisting on macaroni, legumes, rice, fruits, and salads, with oil, cheese, fish, and small birds, but very little meat. More northward, besides fish and a little meat, maize is the chief aliment, rye and other cereals taking a second place. The chestnut also is largely eaten by the poorer population, both it and maize containing more fatty matter than wheat* oats, and legumes.

88 Food and Feeding. Effect of high tem- perature. Avoid grease; putting in a slip of bread, wliicli if browned in a few seconds, a sufficient temperature has been attained, and the bath is ready for use. The above remarks apply equally to the temperature of any oil used for the same purpose. The principle on which success depends is, that at the moment of contact with the almost boiling fat or oil, a thin film of every part of the surface of the fish or other object to be fried is coagulated, so that the juices with their flavours, &c., are at once locked up within, and nothing can escape. The bath should therefore contain quantity sufficient, and also be hot enough, to effect this result in an instant, after which, and during the few seconds or minutes requisite to cook the interior, the heat is often slightly lowered with advantage. The fish or other material employed emerges when done, with a surface to which a little oil adheres, but this will drain oft owing to its extreme fluidity when hot, if left on a napkin slanting a minute or two before the fire; better still on white blotting paper; and thus it may be served absolutely free from grease. The film of egg often applied to the surface of an object to be fried, is in the same manner instantly coagulated and forms an impermeable case; while the fine bread crumbs adher- ing to it take a fine yellow colour, being slightly charred or toasted by the high temperature they are exposed to. In order to be free from grease the bread or biscuit crumbs should be very fine, adhering by means of a thin layer of egg previously applied by the brush. If they are coarse and too abundantly used, grease will adhere to the surface or be absorbed by it.

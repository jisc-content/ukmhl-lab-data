81 Principles and Practice of braising. decoction of all these materials, with stock, and wine serving in part to flavour, and in part to preserve the liquor or mirepoix so that it may he kept for a time, ready for use when wanted. A small quantity of this is then to serve as the fluid in which the portion of meat or bird, &c., is to be braised. The third principle is not generally considered ab- solutely essential to the process; although it is un- doubtedly the last refinement necessary to produce a first-rate braise. It is that of partially browning or half-roasting the portion also; and this may be accom- plished in two ways. The legitimate or original way of doing this, is, to have well fitted to the braise-pot a sunk copper or iron cover, in which some hot cinders Precau- or charcoal are placed, towards the end of the process, usin^top when the braise is nearly finished, in order to transmit heat* downwards a scorching heat to the top of the portion which is uncovered by the liquid in the pot below. In this case it is usual to cover the portion, especially if a fowl, with a piece of white paper, which serves to shield a delicate morsel from a too fierce heat. The other and inferior way is to very lightly roast the meat, before putting it into the pot to. braise, and so dispense with the hot cinders or charcoal on the cover; but this hardens the flesh and tends to prevent the juices penetrating it. It may be seen then, that a braise in which no roasting is employed, does not, after the necessary materials have been prepared, require a great deal of attention, if the cook knows the corner of the fire or hot plate, where the slow and very gentle

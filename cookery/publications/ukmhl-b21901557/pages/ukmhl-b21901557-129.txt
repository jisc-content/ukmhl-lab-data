Aspic Jelly, Salad-making. 115 of water and allowed to simmer for two hours until Aspic reduced to two pints. Pour off through a strainerjelly' and let stand until cold. When required, add two ounces of gelatine (in hot summer weather; one and a half ounce suffices when it is cool) to a pint of the cold liquor, and let it stand two hours. Then heat the remaining pint to boiling point and add to the preceding, with a thin paring of lemon peel, a table-spoonful of lemon juice, the same of mild vinegar, and one or two tea-spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar. At this point pour in two or three whites of eggs, lightly beaten, and stir well to tine the liquor. Bring the whole just up to the boiling point; then at once remove and keep on the hot plate close by, but not boiling, for three minutes only. Take it off and set it aside for three minutes longer, and then strain through flannel. It is now quite hot and clear; stir in at once a large tea-spoonful of Liebig Company’s Extract, and set aside to cool until wanted.

The materials must be secured instruc- fresh, are not to be too numerous and diverse, must be sa°iad-f°r well cleansed and washed without handling, and all making, water removed as far as possible. It may be made by the hostess, or by some member of the family, sufficiently interested to regard the process as an exercise of fine art, immediately before the meal, and be kept cool until wanted.

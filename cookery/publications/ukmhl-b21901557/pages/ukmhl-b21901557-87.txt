73 Slow Cooking oil a Large Scale. serving vegetables completely adapted for digestion. The highest temperature of the three is generally demanded for the last-named, or the longest exposure to heat; for the starch cells throughout the tissue must be burst to scatter their contents, before the required condition is attained. Different compart- ments in the apparatus are easily maintained at varied temperatures by means of steam supplied to each, and the economy in fuel thus effected on the large scale on which this method is applied is considerable. This plan was adopted and systematically applied a few years ago by my friend, Mr. L. 0. Smith, of Stockholm, for the operatives and their families in that city; and detailed accounts of it were published at the time (1884) in this country. And the results were accepted as demonstrating the efficiency and the economy of cookery at low temperatures. The Rev. AY. Moore Ede, of Gateshead, was Rev.Moore attracted by Mr. Smith’s successful use of Becker’s perience" apparatus, and visited Stockholm for the purpose of testing its value. He embodied his observations, which were in the highest degree favourable, in an admirable lecture on cheap food and cooking at Sunderland in 1884, which has since been cheaply printed, and had a deservedly large sale.* He employs for his cheap dinners for children a large box of sheet-iron, felted throughout inside, two and a half * Cheap Food and Cheap Cooking.

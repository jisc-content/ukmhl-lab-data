Food and Feeding. boiling point or a little under, at the corner of the fire for three hours, adding a little water occasionally, to replace that which evaporates. When the time has expired the jar may be removed, the beef-tea drained from the meat, which is then to be pressed as closely as possible through a coarse straining cloth so as to extract all the liquid. After standing a short time the beef-tea will become clear, much light brown fiakey matter falling to the bottom. By no means remove this, as it is nutritious material, unless any special orders have been given to the contrary. When cold, the fluid will be slightly gelatinous, varying somewhat as the meat used may vary in the amount of skin, tendon, or other fibrous tissue contained therein. Jf, however, “shin of beef,” which of course includes bone, is used as well as gravy beef, say a pound of each, add the meat detached from the bone to the pound of gravy beef and treat them together as already described ; but utilize the bone by breaking it with a chopper or hammer, after which the pieces are to be placed in a small saucepan apart, with a pint of cold water, for an hour. Then the whole is to be slowly brought to boiling point, and to be maintained at the same until the liquid is reduced to the third of a pint, which is to be strained off and mixed with the beef-tea already made ; a firm jelly will result when cold. A strong solution of gelatine has thus been added to the meat extractives and albumen obtained by the first process, materially improving the value of the compound. When cold, remove the small quantity of fat which is always to be found on the surface, and heat what is required, as wanted. If the beef-tea is to be served as soon as made without cooling, remove as much of the fat as possible with a teaspoon, and the small remainder by means of white blotting-paper. No better vessel exists for the treatment of the meat (not for the bones) than a small Warren pot; see p. G8.

Had such counsel been listened to by our fore- Milk kas fathers, the mortality from fever might still be in this largely country what it was forty years ago; moreover, we nated know that the cause now in question, like every other t5rPhoid- cause of fever, is a removable one, if reasonable pre- cautions are taken. It was greatly due to the late Dr. Murchison, and to Mr. Ernest Hart, who more than anyone has studied this subject exhaustively, that a well- thc great epidemic of typhoid fever in the parish of Marylebone, in 1873, was traced to a single case at a tion. country farm which supplied milk to a dairy in that parish; directly occasioning no less than 218 cases of fever among the customers of that dairy, of whom twenty-six died. From these a vast number of other cases arose, how many could never by any inquiry be correctly estimated. During the succeeding ten years no less than eighty-one (separate) epidemics were similarly traced in various parts of this country to milk distribution.* The foregoing brief statements suffice to show the importance of the dairy and its products, in connec- tion with the subject of food, even when considered apart from the question of their dietetic value.

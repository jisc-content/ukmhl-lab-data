The principle is that of sealing the surface by heat at first, and not permitting the temperature of the interior to rise to a higher point than just suffices to render it tender, as it becomes filled and expanded by its own juices, which are yielded abundantly in the form of rich red gravy when the meat is cut by the consumer a few minutes afterwards. Hence the morsel, plump and rounded by the action of the heat, must not he touched by a fork, hut he turned when necessary with a pair of light tongs. The value of the grill is, perhaps, nowhere better understood than in England, especially in relation to chops, steak, and kidney; portions of fowl, or a split chicken, the bladebone, or even a small shoulder of mutton—all of which may be thus served in perfection by a competent hand.

70 Food and Feeding. Example of slow cooking at low tempera- ture. Cooking poultry same manner. inner pot which contains the meat; the water should he boiling at the commencement of the process, and for about a quarter of an hour afterwards, to antagonise the effect of the cold meat introduced. Then the pot should be removed to the corner of the fire, or over a gas ring, so as to simmer, that is to maintain the water a few degrees below boiling point. At the end of five or six hours or so the meat will be found perfectly tender, delicately cooked, full of flavour, and amply supplied with its own excellent gravy. When the melted fat has been removed, the potatoes, which have been partially cooked in the upper chamber or steamer, or in some other vessel separately, should he added to the meat in the inner chamber for about half an hour and served in the usual manner. The meat has been cooked at a temperature of about 185° or 190°, probably never exceeding 200°: hence its digestibility from the circumstances explained above. If the potatoes for the stew are cooked in the steamer, above the meat, the water must be kept boiling, during the latter part of the process, about an hour, to supply steam for the purpose. The above, or of a good sized fowl, can be cooked in a Warren pot of the smallest or least expensive size ; but I advise that a fowl should be first boiled in a separate vessel for six or seven minutes, as advised in the Norwegian cooker on the next page, and for the reason there given. And on the whole I think that poultry are better cooked in a quart of milk or of light stock, that is by the wet rather than by the dry process ; in each case of course, at the low temperature named.

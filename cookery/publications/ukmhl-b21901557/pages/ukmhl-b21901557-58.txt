44 Food and Feeding. Domestic mills for grinding wheat. The com- bination of ele- ments necessary for a “perfect” food. Moreover, it retains the natural flavour of the wheat, in place of the insipidity which is characteristic of fine flour, although it is indisputable that bread produced from the latter, especially at Paris and Vienna, is un- rivalled for delicacy, texture, and colour. Whole wheat meal may now be bought in most towns, hut by no means always in such perfect condition as it ought to be. When it cannot he obtained, a useful corn mill, the cutting part to he made of steel, is now constructed cheaply for home use ; the best white wheat should be procured, and the grain can be ground so as to supply a meal of any degree of coarseness desired.* Further examples are unnecessary here, although it would be an easy task to fill a volume with matter of this kind, illustrating the ample means which exist for diminishing somewhat the present wasteful use of “ butchers’ meats ” with positive advantage to the con- sumer. Many facts in support of this position will appear as we proceed. But another important object in furnishing the foregoing details is to point out how combinations of the nitrogenous, starchy, fatty, and mineral elements may be made, in well-proportioned mixtures, so as to produce what I have termed a “ perfect” dish—perfect, that is, so far as the chief in- dication is concerned, viz., one which supplies every demand of the body, without containing any one element in undue proportion. For it is obvious that one or two of these elements may exist in injurious * Kent & Co., the well-known makers of domestic appliances, in High Holborn, supply such mills.

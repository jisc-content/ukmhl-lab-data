Food and Feeding. 200 “The Pot. “ Four different kinds of pot arc employed in domestic cookery :— 1. A cast-iron pot. 2. An earthenware pot. 3. A tinned iron pot. . 4. A copper pot. “ I object strongly to the first two kinds ; to a cast- iron pot, because it is very difficult, if not impossible, to remove the grease, which, after a certain time, becomes engrained in the pores of the cast-iron. I object equally to the earthenware pot, which enjoys a reputation among certain housewives so little warranted. So far from im- proving the broth, it spoils it in every way. When new it preserves for a long time a taste of earth and varnish, of which hot water can never altogether deprive it; when old, it acquires a taste of rancid fat, which no amount of washing can destroy. On the other hand I specially recommend pots of tinned iron or copper, as they arc easily washed, and as it is quite impossible to make a good broth unless the vessel is absolutely clean. “ The Ingredients of the Pot-ciu-Feu. “ I make a distinction between the big and the small pot-au-feu, the latter being for use on ordinary occasions, the former on extraordinary occasions. The small pot- ciu-feu consists of :— 1 lb. 10 oz. of meat (750 grammes). Nearly 5 oz. of bones (125 grammes), (which is about the quantity of bones usually sold with the meat). 7 pints of water (4 litres). 1 oz. of salt (30 grammes). 5| oz. of carrots (150 grammes). 5|- oz. of onions ( „ )• 51 oz. of turnips ( „ ). 7^oz. of leeks (200 grammes). Nearly h oz. of celery (10 grammes). 1 clove—stuck in an onion.

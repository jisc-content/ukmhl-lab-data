VI Preface. New subjects also have been treated in the Appendix which could not be included in the Text, besides Notes illustrative of the latter. I venture to hope that the numerous elementary hints relating to the very wide subject of Food and Feeding which have been brought together here may prove useful, and tend to promote the public taste for one of the most important and interesting branches of study, demanded by the necessities of life and of social intercourse. 35, Wimpole Street, February, 1891.

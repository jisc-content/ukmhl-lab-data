Relative to this subject I have made numerous experiments, and find that the loss in weight by boiling varies with different fish, and also with the mode of operating. It is rarely as low as five per cent., it is generally much more, and I have known it to reach thirty per cent., the water always containing the corresponding amount of lost animal matter. In order to avoid waste as much as possible, the fish should be placed in absolutely boiliug water, which should contain a good proportion of salt. The liquor in which the fish has thus been cooked, I have evaporated, and have obtained from it, in solid deposit, no less than four per cent, of the original weight of the fish; a very startling quantity, constituting it in fact a fish broth. There is no doubt then that steaming is a far more economical process than boiling, and ought to he substituted for the latter when fish is to he cooked by heated water only. To return to the utilisation of the commoner kinds of fish, and of fish trimmings or cuttings, in the composition of stock. From such materials may be made a soup, or better still a stew of fish, in very savoury and nutritious form, for the economical pur- chaser; or a delicate and attractive dish may be presented for an experienced palate. I may offer as an example of the former a receipt from Gouffe, for making a good “consomme” of fish only, without any meat, and therefore a soup maicjre. Put into a large frying-pan, with about three-

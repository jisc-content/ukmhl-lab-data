Salads of Cooked Vegetables. 119 desired, by morsels of haddock, sardine, &c. Well known and appreciated as the Salade de legumes* always is at a Paris restaurant, most persons here would prefer the vegetables simply sliced, so as to preserve some of their natural form and texture, rather than cut into innumerable small cubes, as usually presented. In all cases, such salad should be kept very cool, and be dressed immediately before serving in warm weather. * Salad of Cooked Vegetables. The French salad of cold cooked vegetables, Salade de Ucjum.es, is made as follows : Take 4 oz. of carrots cut in squares of about a quarter of an inch ; 3 oz. of turnips cut in the same way ; 4 oz. of small green asparagus cut in pieces ; 4 oz. of peas, 4 oz. of French beans cut in squares like the turnips and carrots. Boil each of these vegetables separately in about a quart of water, with a teaspoonful of salt ; when cooked strain them on a cloth ; let them cool, and then place the French beaus at the bottom of a salad bowl. Arrange the other vegetables in little heaps around, first the carrots, then the peas, then the turnips, then the asparagus, so as to alternate the colours, and so on again. The rest of the peas and asparagus may be placed in the centre, and sprinkled with a spoonful of chopped ravigote (fresh tarragon, chervil, parsley, and chives). Serve with oil in vinegar apart.

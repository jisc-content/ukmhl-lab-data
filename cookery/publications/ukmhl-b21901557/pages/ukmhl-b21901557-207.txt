With these it is unquestionably essential for any one who treats of my subject to be familiar; but no less necessary is it to possess some natural taste and experience in the cultivation of the gustatory sense; just as a cultivation of the perception of colour and a sensibility to the charm of harmoniously com- bined tints, are necessary to an intelligent enjoyment of the visual sense, and to the understanding of its powers.

Any temperature higher than the above-named tends to solidify it, and when exposed to too much heat, as often happens to a fried or overbroiled steak, it then becomes diminished in thickness and curved instead of being plump and tender, while the shrunken and indurated fibres of the overcooked portion are difficult of digestion by an average stomach. An excellent mode of securing the desired object in boiling is to move the pot containing the portion of meat, as soon as the initial boiling of six or seven minutes is completed, to a small gas ring or lamp, by which a gentle heat, that is about 190° to 200°, can he maintained for five or six hours, instead of the three hours usually required, say for a joint weighing about twelve pounds or more. The “ Bain-marie ” is an old and very simple appli- cation of the principle chiefly employed for the heating of sauces and for other purposes where it is desirable to avoid a temperature which might injure a delicate product, and especially any burning of it. It is simply a small thin saucepan suspended within a larger one adapted for the fire, and containing water which, when boiling, or nearly so, suffices to heat to a few degrees below its own temperature the contents of the inner vessel. This resembles the method on which the carpenter’s glue-pot is constructed, with which most persons are familiar. Captain Warren’s cooking-pot is a further develop- ment of the same principle, which has long been a favourite with many who appreciate excellence and

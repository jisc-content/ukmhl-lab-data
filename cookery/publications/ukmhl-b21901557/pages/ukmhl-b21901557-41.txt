Englishmen consume loo much Animal Food. 2 vegetable products are hardly to be obtained, and flesh and fat are indispensable. Thus man, in the widest sense of the term, is clearly omnivorous ; while tribes or varieties may be advantageously vegetarian in one climate, mixed eaters in another, and exclu- sively flesh-eaters in a third. I have not hesitated to say that Englishmen gene- Engiish- rally have adopted a diet adapted for a somewhat more ^m/too northerly latitude than that which they occupy; that the cost of their food is therefore greater than it need f00d. be, and that their numerous forms of indigestion and much resulting chronic disease are further necessary consequences of the same error. They consume too much animal food, particularly the flesh of cattle. For all who are occupied with severe and continuous Circum- mechanical labour, a mixed diet, of which cereals and ^ichS legumes form a large portion, and fish, some fat meat, “°^ify bacon, or lard, eggs, cheese, and milk form a moderate, but constant proportion, is more nutritious and whole- some than a ration largely consisting of the flesh of animals. For those whose labour is chiefly mental, and whose muscular exercise is inconsiderable, still less of concentrated nitrogenous food is desirable. Then there is a large class of persons who indulge, not neces- sarily in quantity, but in a kind of food generally reputed “simple and wholesome,” which nevertheless for them, creates a condition of corpulence, not merely incon- venient, but prejudicial to health, and to their pro- spects of longevity. Such tendencies existing, and espe- cially if the individual does not, or cannot take much exercise, the choice of food, free from fatty constituent.

The halibut, from the North Sea, closely related to the turbot, is good and substantial food, and when large, as it often is, is also very cheap. The sea-bream, not unlike a large freshwater perch, and the basse, which has been sometimes styled a white salmon, are both useful varieties which have never received the attention they deserve, and which may be presented simply yet effectively at table. The gurnard is much better known, and an excellent dish may be made with it. Among cheap fish, which might be obtained in any quantity and at a very small price, arc the ling and hake, related closely to the cod, but chiefly used at present as salted fish and exported; the thornback, of the same family as the skate, and equal in quality; the pollack, a substantial whiting, and the coal-fish, of the same family, but second in order of quality, are both good when in season; a proviso which, it is to be remembered, applies equally to every variety.

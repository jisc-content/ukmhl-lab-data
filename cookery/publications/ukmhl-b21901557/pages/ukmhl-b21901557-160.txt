Food and Feeding. 146 Why is the dish, soup The rationale of the initial soup has often been dis- cussed : some regard it as calculated to diminish digestive power, on the theory that so much fluid taken at first dilutes the gastric juices. But there appears to be no foundation for this belief: a clear soup, or the fluid constituents of a puree, disappear almost immediately after entering the stomach, being absorbed by the proper vessels, and in no way inter- fere with the gastric juice which is stored in its appropriate cells ready for action. The habit of commencing dinner with soup has without doubt its origin in the fact that aliment in this fluid form—in fact, ready digested—soon enters the blood and rapidly refreshes the hungry man, who, after a considerable fast and much activity, often sits down with a sense of exhaustion to commence his principal meal. In two or three minutes after taking a plate of good warm consomme, the feeling of exhaustion disappears, and irritability gives way to the gradually rising sense of good-fellowship with the circle. Some persons are accustomed to allay exhaustion by taking a glass of sherry before food—a gastronomic no less than a physiological blunder, since it overstimulates and tends to injure an empty stomach, while it depraves the palate. On the other hand, the soup introduces at once into the system a small instalment of ready- digested food, and saves the period of time which, in the absence of soup, must be spent by the stomach in deriving some portion of nutriment from solid aliment; and thus the organ of digestion itself is rapidly strengthened for its forthcoming duties.

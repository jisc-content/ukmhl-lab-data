102 Food and Feeding. Sauces. Garni- tures in variety. rank. And thus it is that the department of sauces especially gives opportunity to develop and illustrate these qualities; and here it is that the artist’s skill is most clearly manifested. And the reader who desires to become acquainted with the principles and practice of sauces, a subject too large and too recondite to he dealt with here, must consult a first-rate French authority, as unquestion- ably the highest on this subject.* After sauces come garnitures. Respecting these a few hints may be given, for agreeable and even important additions may be made to most small dishes of animal food under this title of “ garnish.” Whether it be a small filet, braised or roasted, or a portion thereof broiled; a fricandeau, or the choice end of a neck of mutton made square and compact by shortening the bones; or a small loin, or a dish of trimmed neck cutlets, or a choice portion of broiled rumpsteak; a tender ox tongue, a couple of sweetbreads, poultry, pigeon, or what not—the garnish * I can (scarcely recommend a better than the classical work of Gouffe before referred to. But it may, perhaps, be a little out of date in some details, although the leading principles must remain unchanged, and it is still an admirable guide to practice. For the purposes of the best English kitchens, “La Cuisine d’Aujourd’hui,” by Urbain Dubois, E. Dentu, Paris, 1889, pp. 760, is a storehouse of trustworthy information, and it is well illustrated. Price 12 francs. But for a modern encyclopaedic work on the subject, including “la haute cuisine,” the following, by Dubois & Bernard conjointly, is beyond question the most complete :— “Cuisine classique : Etudes raisonnees et demonstratives de l’Ecole Fran^aise ; deux grands volumes, 77 planches gravees ; Dubois et Bernard. 14 edition, E.

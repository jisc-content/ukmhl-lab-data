8 Food and Feeding. What is food 1 Physiolo- gical ne- cessities for food, and to replace wasted structure, “ a meal,” must also be considered in relation to various purposes. I sliall not regard this as the place in which to offer any scientific definition of the term food. I shall include within its range all the solid materials popularly so regarded and therefore eaten. And drink being as necessary as solids for the purpose of digestion, and to supply that large proportion of fluid which the body contains in every mesh and cell thereof, I shall regard as “ drink ” all the liquids which it is customary to swallow with our meals, although probably very few, if any, of them can be regarded as food in any strict sense of the term. Food is essential to the body in order to fulfil two distinct purposes, or to supply two distinct wants in- separable from animal life. As certainly as a steam- engine requires fuel, by the combustion or oxidation of which force is called into action for various purposes— as the engine itself requires the mending and replacing of parts wasted in the process of working—so certainly does the animal body require a supply of digestible matter by means of which force can be produced ; and also a special form of nutriment to replace those parts which are necessarily wasted by labour, whether it be physical or mental, that is, of limbs or of brain. The material which is competent to supply both requirements is a complete or perfect food. Examples of complete food exist in milk and the egg, sufficing as these do for all the wants of the young animal during the period of early growth. Neverthe-

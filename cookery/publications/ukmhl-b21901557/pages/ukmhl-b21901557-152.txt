Let all simmer together for two hours gently, at the corner of the fire; take out the bones and pass all the rest through a coarse strainer. Divide the fillets of whiting into two or three small portions each, boil for a few minutes in some of the stock, add a little fresh green chervil and parsley chopped, not too finely, and serve all together in a tureen. If the soup is preferred somewhat thicker in body than this receipt produces, let it he made so by adding some farinaceous matter in small quantity, as baked flour or, if preferred, a tablespoonful of white “ roux ” (that is, a little flour well mixed with butter in a stewpan over the fire, cooked, but not allowed to brown), and this is unquestionably an improvement. It is unnecessary to clarify fish soups; if other garnish is desired, quenelles of whiting may be substituted for the fillets; and some of them may have a little coral (spawn of the lobster) added to furnish flavour and colour. A further change may be made by adding fillets of other fish, or a few shell-fish. To make a bouillabaise in the Marseillaise fashion* take three or four pounds of fish; whiting, sole, small haddock, red mullet, and, following the Mar- seilles receipt strictly throughout, a very small conger- eel or a portion of one. All these are to be cleaned, cut in slices, and their bones removed; two dozen of mussels to be added. * Referred to at p. 101.

I have longed to show to them a more excellent way, but have feared that any offer to suggest one, would be regarded as impertinence, or as meddlesome interference on my part. I hope soon to be in possession of a “ workman’s pail,” through the kind- ness of my friendly correspondent, its inventor, and if I find it as efficient as I have reason to believe it will be, I shall be only too glad to let it be seen and tested by some of those whom it so much concerns.

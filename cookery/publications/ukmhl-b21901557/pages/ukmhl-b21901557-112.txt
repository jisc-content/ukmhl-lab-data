Food and Feeding. 98 Turtle, mulliga- tawny, &c. Distinc- tions in soups for “fasting.” referred to as not belonging to the above-mentioned classes. Such as real turtle, made either in part or wholly from the live animal; a large proportion is prepared from the imported dried flesh, when the stock is almost invariably made from veal and beef ;* after this come mock turtle or calf’s head; ox-tail,mulligatawny; while giblet and “cock-a-leekie,” are almost stews ; the latter doubtless designed originally to present the patriarch of the poultry yard in an eatable form. Another Scotch soup, “hotch-potch,” like an Italian “minestre” or “minestrone,” may contain almost a meal of fragrant combinations.

All these take rank of course among the five classes first named; but they are referred to separately here * An amusing controversy took place last autumn in consequence of my having stated in a paper read at the Fisheries Exhibition that turtle soup when “ at its best ” was composed of a stock made from the conger eel, the turtle furnishing the garnish and the name. The turtle soup makers rushed into print, especially some well-known artists at the East end of London, who used language which was more remark- able for force than for elegance. Never was there a more striking illustration of the proverb, “ qui s'cxcicsc s'accuse.” I had never brought any accusation against any turtle soup maker : I had merely expressed the opinion given above ; one to which I still firmly adhere. Much less was I guilty of affirming in any of my writings, that the artists above alluded to had ever made turtle soup “at its best! ”

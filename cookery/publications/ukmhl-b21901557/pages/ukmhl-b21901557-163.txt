lIors-d'CE uvrcs. 149 I think, because their presence, being demanded by foreign gastronomic taste, is supposed to be therefore necessarily correct. But the active exer- cise and athletic habits of the Englishman, his activity of body and mind in commercial pursuits, all tend to bring him to the dinner-table wanting food rather than appetite, and in no mind to ask for “whets” to increase it. Among idle men, their whose heavy lunch, liberally accompanied with necessity wine and not followed by exercise, has barely dis- appeared from the stomach at the hour of dinner, a able, piquant prelude as stimulus of appetite is more ap- preciated. Hence the original invention of hors- d'oeuvres; and their appearance in a very much slighter and more delicate form than that which has been described, still to be observed in connection with the chief repasts of the Latin races. The one plate which heralds dinner, indigenous to our country, is also one of its own best products—the oyster. But Oysters, this is scarcely a hors-d'oeuvre. In itself a single service of exquisite quality, served with attendant graces of mild and delicate vinegar or lemon juice, brown bread and butter, and a glass of light chablis for those who take it, the half-dozen natives occupying the hollow shells, and bathed in their own liquor, hold rank of a very different kind to that of the miscellaneous assortment of tit-bits alluded to. Oys- • ters are in fact the first dish of dinner and not its precursor; the preface, and not the — possibly — obtrusive advertisement. And this brings us to the dinner of invitation.

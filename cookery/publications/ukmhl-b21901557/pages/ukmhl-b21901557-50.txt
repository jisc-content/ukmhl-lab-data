36 Food and Feeding. Legumin- ous foods. The “ Erbs- wurst ” and its value. most of the mineral elements have been removed; a subject to be considered at some length hereafter (see p. 41). But beans and peas arc richer in nitrogen than wheat, and equal it in starch, mineral matters, and fat, the last being in very small quantity, while maize has three times their proportion of fat. Hence all of these would he useful additions to his dietary, being cheaper than wheat in the market, although, the retail demand being at present small, they may not he so in the small shops. As an illustration of the value of legumes combined with fat, it may he remem- bered how well the Erbswurst supported the work of the German armies during the winter of 1870-71, an instructive lesson for us in England at the present moment. It consisted of a well-cooked puree of peas, mixed with a certain proportion of bacon or lard, and dried so as to be portable, constituting in very small compass a perfect food, especially suitable for supporting muscular activity and exposure to cold. Better than any flesh, certainly any which could be transported with ease, the cost was not more than half that of ordinary meat. It was better also, because the form of the food is one in which the nutriment is readily acces- sible and easily digested; it was relished cold, or could be converted in a few minutes into good soup with boiling water. But for our labourer probably the best of the legumes is the haricot bean, red or white, the dried mature bean of the plant whoso pods we eat in the early green state as “French beans.”* For this * Wliat we call “French Leans’’maybe the product of several kindred varieties of the kidney Lean, dwarf or climbing, varying

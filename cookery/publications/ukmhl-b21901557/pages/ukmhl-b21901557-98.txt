Food and Feeding. 84 The French idea; its value and utility. Compari- son of the two in practice. The opposite principle is that which has been deve- loped in association with the production of meats and poultry which are naturally somewhat insipid. Since it has been the custom not to rear in France fine mature beef or mutton, as we understand those meats here, but rather to consume almost exclusively an immature product, veal, as well as poultry, much of which, although the best of its kind, is naturally wanting in sapid character; these have become, and rightly so, the vehicles of various delicious adventi- tious flavours, for which purpose the white meats are valued rather than for their inherent qualities. This character of veal is illustrated in a passage occurring in the first number of the famous Almanack des Gour- mands, which appeared in Paris at the commencement of the present century:—“Yeal lends itself to so many metamorphoses that we may fairly term it ‘ the chameleon of cookery.’ ” * Precisely the same view is held by Brillat-Savarin, but in relation to poultry, when he says, “ Poultry is for cookery what canvas is to the painter.” f In such conditions, therefore, it is natural that French cuisine should be essentially distinguished for its sauces, by which it adorns and transforms material in itself somewhat uninteresting or uninviting. The Englishman loves the flavour of three or four years’ old mutton (unhappily almost a tradition now), mature beef, the wildest game, both winged and ground; and he cares not how little of “sauce” is * Almanack des Gourmands.

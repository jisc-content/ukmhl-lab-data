Two gas jets will raise the contents (thirty gallons) to the boiling point, and a very small amount of flame suffices to maintain the lower temperatures preferred for as many hours as arc required. More recently, a complete and efficient apparatus, adapted for all the uses of a small or large family, has been designed and thoroughly tested in America by Mr. Edw. Atkinson, of Brookline, Mass. He first introduced the apparatus to the public as the “Aladdin Cooker,” for boiling, stewing, &c., and has rendered it more useful and efficient for all methods of cooking, except broiling and frying, under the name of the “Aladdin Oven.” Much is often said of the economy effected by all these methods of slow cookery, on the ground of the smaller loss in weight produced by them, as compared with roasted meats. This is much less than would appear at first sight to be the case. It is quite true that a joint weighing fourteen pounds when roasted or baked may weigh only eleven, and if cooked in the closed slow-temperature chamber may be finished at twelve pounds and a half. The difference is chiefly water; the far-reaching cooking odours amount to nothing; this is produced by slight decomposition of the surface, one result of which is a highly appreciated and appetising flavour in a very thin superficial layer, giving character to roasted and broiled meats, which cannot be obtained by any slow or closed-chamber process. The principle on which all of them act is to prevent the escape of heat by constructing the oven

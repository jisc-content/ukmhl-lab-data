APPENDIX. ON THE POT-AU-FEU, SOUPS, &C. Pot-au-feii: Jules Gouffe's instructions for making it—The receipt of Alexandre Dumas—Braising—Bceuf a la Mode—Vegetable Soup—Beef-tea—Table showing when Fish is in Season— Children’s Dinner Tables—The Food of the Working Man. Jules Gouffe’s instructions for the Pot-au-feu, referred Children’ to, page 82. _ ?£?£ “ The broth (bouillon) of beef is the foundation ofp domestic cookery. “ It constitutes the most essential and really nourish- ing part of our daily food, that is, good meat soup. It is, moreover, the basis of a large number of culinary preparations such as ragouts, sauces, purees, &c. “ The chief of all broths is undeniably beef-broth, many others, of course, existing, such as those of fowl, vegetables, fish, and game. “ The production of a good pot-au-feu seems to me to be one of those operations, at the same time elementary and fundamental, with which it is of the highest im- portance to render every one familiar, as soon as domestic cooking is treated of. “ I shall not refrain from entering into the most minute details, even though it bring a smile to the face of those who take no heed of that which forms the first step in cooking. What I attach most importance to is, to enable even a person who approaches a range for the first time in his life, to make quite sure of succeeding, if my instructions arc followed precisely.

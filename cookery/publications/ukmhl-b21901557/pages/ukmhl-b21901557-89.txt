75 Atkinson's Aladdin Oven. of materials wliicli are thoroughly non-conducting, and therefore do not consist of metal, invariably em- ployed for kitchen ranges. Metal conducts heat away rapidly, and requires constant supplies of fresh heat, a process which renders difficult the maintenance of an equable temperature, besides being costly through wasteful consumption of fuel. The thick sides of the Construc- Aladdin oven are made of indurated and incombustible tlon‘ “ papier maclie,” or of a wood pulp, desiccated, which is practically almost the same thing, one of the best non-conductors of heat known, with a thin metallic lining ; the interior cavity available for cooking, which is divided by moveable horizontal partitions for different dishes, measuring from a foot to a foot and a half in every direction, in the sizes at present mostly used. The heat is supplied to the oven by means of an oil lamp below, or by gas ; in either case the amount supplied being always under the control of the cook. The whole of this heat, or nearly so, is conveyed into the interior of the chamber—no admis- sion of the products of combustion from the lamp or of gas with the air there being possible—to be utilised for culinary purposes. A chimney is unnecessary, as the waste products of the small flame required are inconsiderable, and may escape into the apartment, There being so little loss of heat, the plan is admir- ably adapted for hot summer weather, since the stove radiates no perceptible warmth into the surrounding air. It is not intended for cooking rapidly, but at a Mode of rate during the day requiring fully double the time usill&- consumed by the common kitchen range, while for

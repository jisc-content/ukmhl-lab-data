CHAPTER VIII. The combination of dishes to form a meal—Three specific systems of arranging the daily meals—Characteristics of each meal— Breakfast—Lunch—Dinner of two kinds—Value of initial soup—Plan of dishes to follow—Hors-d'ceuvres, &c. The art of combining dishes to form a meal now demands our consideration. The occupations of man in a civilised state, no less than the natural suggestions of his appetite, require stated and regular times for feeding. But the number of these set apart in the twenty-four hours differs considerably among different races, and also among different classes of society. It must suffice for us to consider the subject only so far as the limits of Europe are concerned. Taking a general view of this subject, it may be said that there are three principal systems to which all varieties of habit may be reduced. From an English point of view, these may be regarded as— 1. The French system of two meals a day ; adopted by several other Continental nations. 2. The system of provincial life (Great Britain), or four meals, with which the habits of Holland and Northern Germany are more or less analogous. 3. The system of town life, of which London is the type, or three meals a day. 1. In the French system, the slight refreshment Daily meals should be regular. Number varies in different races. Reducible to three chief systems.

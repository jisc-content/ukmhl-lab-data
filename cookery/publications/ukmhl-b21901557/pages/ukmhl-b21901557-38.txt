24 Food and Feeding. Germany. Norway and Sweden. Russia. The Arctic Circle. Throughout the German Empire, the cereals, legumes, greens, roots, and fruits supply an im- portant proportion of the food consumed by the com- mon population. Wheaten bread chiefly, and some made from rye, also beans and peas, are used abun- dantly. Potatoes and green vegetables of all kinds are served in numerous ways, but largely in soup, a favourite dish. Meats, chiefly pork, are greatly esteemed in the form of sausage, and appear also in small portions or joints, but freely garnished with vegetables, on the tables of those who can afford animal diet. Moreover, sweet farinaceous dishes, containing more or less butter or lard, abound. Going northward, where the climate is no longer adapted for the production of wheat, as in Norway and Sweden, the common people rarely see bread, living on oat and rye meal porridge, potatoes, adding much bacon and herrings for necessary fat. Hard rye cakes hanging in the cottage rafters half the year are esteemed, as is sour milk in summer, and coffee or weak beer at all times. In northern Russia the same cereals, salted fish, and bacon form the staple foods, while much coarse-grain spirit is consumed. Lastly, it is well known that the inhabitants of the Arctic zone are compelled to consume large quantities of oily matter, in order to generate heat abundantly ; and also that animal food is necessarily the staple of their dietary. Yegetables, which moreover are not producible in so severe a climate, would there be wholly inadequate to support life.

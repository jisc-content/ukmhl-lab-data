In braising, of which, as we shall see, there are two Braising; processes, the meat may be just covered with a strong liquor of vegetable and animal juices (technically two called braise or mirepoix) in a closely covered vessel, methods! from 'which as little evaporation as possible is per- mitted, and is exposed for a considerable time to a surrounding heat several degrees short of boiling.

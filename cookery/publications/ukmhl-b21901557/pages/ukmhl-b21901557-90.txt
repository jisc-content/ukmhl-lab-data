Bread may he made in it very successfully when the boiling and baking pro- cesses necessary for a meal have been completed, and much heat remains still to he utilised.* The cooking of meat by heat through radiation, and by heated dry air—“ roasting ” and “ baking.’’ Boasting is the cooking of meat in front of a clear, bright fire, the heat radiating from which into the “ roaster,” a metallic enclosure open towards the fire only, and containing the joint, turned therein by means of a bottle-jack. The fire, being at its best, the joint, poultry, or game, is placed very near at first—an analogous proceeding to the initial step in broiling—in order to seal the entire surface by coagulating its albumen at the outset, and so enclose the fluids securely within. This is accomplished in about eight to ten minutes for a large joint, or in four or five for a piece of poultry. The roaster is then drawn half a foot to a foot farther back, so as to diminish the heat thenceforward. The opportunity of basting the joint, which, especially towards the close of the process, should be frequently done with dripping from the pan below, is one of the advantages of this mode of cooking, which cannot he secured by any * The Art of Cooking.

Constituents necessary in Human Food. c less a Single animal product like either of the two named, although complex in itself, is not more perfect than an artificial combination of various simpler sub- stances, provided the mixture (dish or meal) contains all the elements required in due proportion for the purposes of the body. .It would be out of place to occupy much space with those elementary details of the chemical consti- tution of the body which may he found in any small manual of human physiology;* but for the right understanding of our subject, a brief sketch must°be presented. Let it suffice to say that carbon, hydro- gen, and oxygen, the three all-pervading elements of the vegetable world, enter largely into the composi- to furnish ti°n of the animal body; and that the two former fu®Iforthe combined especially constitute a fuel, the oxidation of heaTand which produces animal heat, and developes the force for lafcour in its. varied forms, physical and mental, which the body is capable of exerting. Besides these, nitrogen, obtainable from certain vegetable products, not from all, but forming definite combinations with the three elements just named, is essential to the repair and All the reproduction of the body itself, being one of its most the important constituents. Lastly must be named several body must other elements which, in small proportions, are also pfjed hi essential constituents of the body; such as sulphur, food, phosphorus, salts of lime, magnesia, potash, &c., with traces of iron and ether metals. All these must be * Such as Physiology, Science Primer, by M. Foster, M.A., M.D. (Macmillan) ; Lessons in Elementary Physiology, by Professor Huxley Macmillan)

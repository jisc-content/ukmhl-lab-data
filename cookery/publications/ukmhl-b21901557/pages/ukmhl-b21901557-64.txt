In the same way almost every national dish might be analysed, up to the pot-au-feu of our neighbours, the right management of which combines the nutritious quality of flesh with the abundant aroma and flavour of fresh vegetables which enter so largely into this economical and excellent mess (see pp. 92-3). Among the poorer classes this dish is, of course, intended to supplement a considerable quantity of bread. All the It will be apparent that, up to this point, our esti- mate of the value of these combinations has been limited, or almost so, by their physiological complete- ness as foods, and by their economical value in relation to the resources of that great majority of all popula- tions, which is poor. But when the inexorable neces- sity for duly considering economy has been complied with, the next aim is to render food as easily digestible as possible, and agreeable to the senses of taste, smell, and sight.

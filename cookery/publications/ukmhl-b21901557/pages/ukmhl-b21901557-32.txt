All of them furnish nitrogenous matter largely, hut, and particularly the white fish, possess fat in very small quantity, with a fair proportion of saline ma- terials. The salmon, mackerel, eels, and herring tribes have more fat, the last-named in considerable quantity, forming a useful food well calculated to supplement cereal aliments, and largely adopted for the purpose both in the south and north of Europe. The so-called reptiles furnish turtle, tortoise, and edible frog. Among articulated animals are the lob- sters, crabs, and shrimps. Among molluscs, the oyster and all the shellfish, which, as well as the preceding animals, in chemical composition closely resemble that of fish properly so called. I shall not enter on a discussion of the question : Is man designed to be a vegetable feeder, or a flesh- eating or an omnivorous animal ? Any evidence to be found by anatomical investigation can only be safely regarded as showing what man is and has been. Thus the characters of his teeth and digestive organs indi- cate that during his long history of development he has mainly lived on roots, seeds, nuts and fruits; in other words, he has been a vegetable feeder. For the organs named are in all essential points, identical with those possessed by the highest apes whose food is that described. During the stages of what is called civilisation, he has gradually extended his resources and has long been omnivorous to the extent which his experience and his circumstances have permitted. 'Whether he has been generally prudent or happy in

Food and Feeding. 46 Improved by cook- ing. The peasant’s “ cheese- fondu.” Mattieu Williams’ sugges- tion. whose daily life affords little opportunity for muscular activity find cheese, at all events when uncooked, not easily digestible. And when such do employ it as an article of food, it should be regarded as taking the place of meat, which is not so rich in nitrogen. Mr. Mattieu Williams has some good remarks on this subject,* from which it appears that when properly cooked, cheese is probably more easily assimilated by an ordinary stomach, than when eaten in the raw condition. The well-known “ cheese fondu ” is an example. Here is the Swiss peasant’s form as he gives it, and of the dish thus produced he speaks highly, from observation as well as from personal experience, in relation to its sustainiug power, and its right to form the staple dish of a substantial meal, appropriately adding:—“ it is rather too good—over- nutritious—for a man only doing sedentary work.” Mix grated cheese and eggs beaten as for an omelette, adding a little new milk or butter. Place the mixture in a saucer-shaped pan which stands the fire, over which it is to be gently cooked, stirring well until the whole is dissolved, and the mixture is homo- geneous ; serve it in the pan, and eat it with a good supply of bread, and with salt and mustard to taste. Mr. Williams further suggests that a small quantity of bicarbonate of potash may be added with advantage to the ingredients before cooking—say 15 or 20 grains for a dish sufficing for two persons.

139 A Boui/labaise: a Common Steiv. Put into a stewpan two onions sliced, two tomatoes peeled, a carrot sliced; then, in a coarse net bag, the following:—two hay leaves, two slices of lemon, half the zest of a Seville orange, two cloves, a little thyme, several sprigs of parsley, a clove of garlic, two red capsicums cut, and a little saffron: add salt and pepper, and a little pimento. Place the pieces of fish over these, pour in six tablespoonfuls of olive oil; add three pints of water, with two or three glasses of white French wine; cover, and let all boil well together for half an hour. The whiting, however, should be put in only a quarter of an hour before finishing. Serve the whole in a soup tureen with slices of toasted bread apart; or place them in the tureen before filling. The following receipt is offered for an economical dish, or fish stew suitable for a working man’s family :— Take three or four pounds of hake, ling, skate, or Working haddock, and a pound of “ cuttings or trimmings,” fisl1 which are the best part of the fish for stock making. Remove all the fish from the bones, break up or pound the latter, and set aside with any portion of head there may be, and the cuttings. Put into a saucepan, over the fire, two ounces of lard and two or three onions sliced, and let them fry until brown; then add two quarts of water and all the pounded bones and trimmings, some parsley or other green herbs, pepper and salt. Let the whole simmer for three hours, adding the amount of water lost by evapora- tion. Strain out the bones, bits of skin, &c., add the fish in pieces, and boil gently ten or fifteen minutes.

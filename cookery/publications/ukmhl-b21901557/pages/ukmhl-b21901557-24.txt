Food and Feeding. present in the food supplied, otherwise animal exist- ence cannot he supported; and all are found in the ' egetahle kingdom, and may he obtained directly therefrom hy man in feeding on vegetables alone.* But the process of obtaining and combining these simple elements into the more complex forms which constitute the bases of animal tissues—definite com- pounds of nitrogen with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen —is also accomplished hy the lower animals, which are exclusively vegetable feeders. These animals we can consume as food, and thus procure, if we please, ready prepared for our purpose, the materials of flesh, sinew, and bone, for immediate use. "We obtain also from the animal milk and the egg, already said to be “ perfect ” foods; and they are so because they con- tain the nitrogenous compounds referred to, fatty matter abundantly, and the various saline or mineral matters requisite. But compounds simpler in form than the preceding, of a non-nitrogenous kind, that is, of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen only, are neces- sary as food for the production of animal heat and force. These consist, first, of the fat of animals of various kinds; the fat of milk, cream, or butter; also the fatty products of the vegetable kingdom, which are found in grain and legumes, and largely in the olive and in many seeds: secondly, of the starchy * The vegetable kingdom comprehends the cereals, legnmes, roots, starches, sugar, herbs, and fruits. Persons who style themselves vegetarians, often consume milk, egg3, butter, cheese, and lard, which are choice foods from the animal kingdom. There are other persons, of course, who are strictly vegetable eaters, and such alone have any right to the title of vegetarians.

CHAPTER XI. Alleged difficulty in com- posing a menu. In order to arrange a dinner some practical acquaintance with food necessary—Also of the season at which it is in perfection—The scheme or elementary outline of a dinner—Menus should he written in French—Two menus for each month in the year— The order in which dishes should be presented—Numerous dishes not included among them—Truffles. The remark is frequently heard from the domestic head of an English family, the lady of the house— who, although in easy circumstances and much occu- pied in good society, does not care to delegate her authority to a skilled professional housekeeper—that nothing puzzles her more than the composition of menus for the inevitable dinner parties. She feels almost as ready, or rather as unready, as she would he if called upon to compose a sonnet or a symphony. Tier husband, whose counsels are so valuable, or at all events are so promptly furnished on almost all other topics, utterly fails in his attempt to offer a suggestion now. Hence she meets her cook on terms which preclude exercise of choice or criticism ; and the latter becomes mainly the author of the programme. But a leading confectioner and dinner purveyor may also be consulted, who supplies the suggestion desired, sending in a dish or two in consequence ; and a suit- able congruity is devoutly hoped for as the result.

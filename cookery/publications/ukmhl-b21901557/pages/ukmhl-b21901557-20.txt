6 Food and Feeding. Evils of early indi- gestion thus, and otherwise caused. healthy appetite produces; and the intention that food should he adapted to the physical needs of the body and the healthy action of the mind is forgotten altogether. So it often comes to pass, that at middle age, when man finds himself in the full current of life’s occupations, struggling for pre-eminence with his fellows, indigestion has become persistent in some of its numerous forms, shortens his “ staying power,” or spoils his judgment or temper. And, besides all this, how apparent it is that few causes are more potent than an incompetent stomacli to engender habits of selfishness and egotism. A constant care to provide little personal wants of various hinds, thus rendered necessary, developes the growth of these sentiments, and they influence the man’s whole character in con- sequence. On the other hand, the poor man, advanc- ing in years, shows signs of damage to his constitu- tion from continuous toil with inadequate food, the supply of which is often diminished by his expenditure for beer, which, although not seldom noxious, he regards as the elixir of life, never to be missed when fair occasion for obtaining it is offered. Many of this class arc prematurely crippled by articular disease, &c., and become permanent inmates of the parish workhouse or infirmary. It must be obvious to everybody how much more of detail might be added to fill in the outlines of this little sketch. It is meagre in the extreme : neverthe- less it amply suffices for my purpose ; other illustra- tions will occur to any observer who cares to pursue the subject further.

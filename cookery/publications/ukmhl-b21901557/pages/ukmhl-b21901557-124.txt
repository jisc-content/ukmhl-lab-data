If, instead of stock, milk is used, an agreeable change may he made; and this form constitutes macaroni au maigre, the foregoing receipts being au gras.

Any milk remaining unabsorbed by the macaroni may he thickened with baked flour {white). Flavour with a little cinnamon or vanilla, or otherwise to taste, and sweeten with sugar or saccharin, if desired.

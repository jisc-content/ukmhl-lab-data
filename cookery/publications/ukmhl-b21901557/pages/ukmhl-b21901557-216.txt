former to keep it in form for serving afterwards, and chopping the bones into morsels. First put the bones in the pot and the meat upon them. Pour in the water cold, and place the pot on tho fire. Add the salt. Make it boil, and as soon as the scum rises, pour in a little cold water. Skim with a perforated spoon. Let it boil three separate times, and skim each time, after which the broth should be sufficiently skimmed. Wipe carefully the edges of the pot. Next add the vegetables named above, which will check the boiling for a minute ; as soon as it begins again, place the pot on the corner of the fire, or hot plate, letting it only simmer gently, five hours for the big, and three hours for the small pot-au- feu. It is essential that the simmering should be quite regular and continuous. When the broth is made, take out the meat and put it on a dish ; taste the broth and see if it is salt enough. If more salt is wanted, it should not be added till the broth has been put in the soup- tureen. Care should be taken not to salt the broth too highly at first, as it always becomes more salt on being warmed up the second day, and still more so when reduced to a sauce. “Another essential point is to free the broth perfectly from grease, after the meat is taken out, the pot being still on the fire. “ Observations on the Vegetables for the Pot-au-feu. “ The vegetables should be left in the broth only just long enough to cook them. By this time they have given their flavour to the broth, after which they would only rob it of its goodness. “ It is generally considered, and justly so, that the broth should have a golden tint; the flavour is not improved thereby, but the eye is satisfied. Yet care must be taken not to alter the flavour ; therefore if any colouring matter is used, it should be caramel, while fried onion, fried carrot, and similar substances, should be avoided for the reason given.” * * J.

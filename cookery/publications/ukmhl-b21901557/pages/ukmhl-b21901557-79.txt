Cooking Flesh in Heated Water. 65 reduction in the heat of boiling water may be noted at every 1,000 feet of elevation; thus in mountain climbing it is quite possible to reach a height at which water boils when not sufficiently hot even to cook an egg efficiently, which can be done at 180°. Now in the culinary treatment of flesh of all kinds, Twomoie3 and of fish, by water, the object to be attained by the cooking process must first be distinctly apprehended. If from meat; a given portion of flesh it is desired to extract as much of the soluble portions as possible, as for the purpose of making soup or beef tea, the course pursued will be directly opposite to that which is necessary when the object is to prepare the portion for a dish to be consumed at the table. In the latter case we retain all the nutritive and sapid qualities within the portion, leaving none or very little in the water used for cooking. In the former case we leave the flesh, if possible, exhausted of flavour and nourishing juices, nearly all of which we desire to find in the water employed. The principle rc-lied on to accomplish our aim in depending each case is based on the fact that the albumen, °f heaTon which pervades both flesh and fish, is fluid and albumen, soluble at low temperatures, suppose we say from 60° to 120° or 130° Fahr., while it becomes solidified and insoluble at temperatures of 160° and upwards. Hence, if we desire to realize the first-named object, for stock soup or beef tea, some meat previously cut 1, For fine is macerated for two or three hours in cool or beef tea» tepid water, after which not only the bulk of the nutritive matter referred to as albumen, but other valu-

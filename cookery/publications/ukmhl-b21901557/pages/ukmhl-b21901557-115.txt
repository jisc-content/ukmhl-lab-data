Bouillabaise: importance of good Consomme*. ioi able products of culinary art in this direction. Thackeray’s well-known rhymes do not exaggerate its good qualities, and enumerate its component elements almost with sufficient accuracy to direct the cook.* See Chapter VII., on the subject of fish as food, for remarks on its selection and preparation for receipts or fish soups and stew including directions for preparing a Marsellaise Bouillabaise. I may conclude this brief sketch of soups by ob- serving that the ability to make a good, fragrant, and clear consomme, yet fine in colour with a certain softness and smoothness of body—and nothing is easier, granted a moderate intelligence and the power of exe- cuting simple details with care—affords the key to almost all. The preparation of vegetables and the making of purees, are merely mechanical processes, easily attained. The judgment necessary to add and combine spices, essences, and other sources of flavour, for soups, sauces, and sweet entremets, is the one element which when possessed, in addition to the character of an attentive, dexterous, and pains-taking workman, essential to success in every profession, constitutes a finished cook, and denotes his or her * ‘ ‘ This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is A sort of soup, or broth, or brew, Or hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes That Greenwich never could outdo : Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffern, Soles, onions, garlic, roach and dace ; All these you eat at Jerre’s tavern In that one dish of Bouillabaisse.” The title of “ cook ” does not belong to one who cannot make a good con- somme.

It was formerly largely consumed, being originally cooked in the manner which is now commonly adopted for the oyster, when presented as above described. Long after the scallops, oysters came to be esteemed, and being cooked in the same way, were therefore said to be “scalloped.” The original “ scallops” may still be had at our fishmongers, and when thinly sliced and so dressed, are by no means to be altogether neglected.

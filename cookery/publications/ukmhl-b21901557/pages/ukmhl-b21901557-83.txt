Cooking at Loza Temperatures. 69 economy combined in the work wliicli it is capable of doing. It is constructed on the plan of the “ bain- marie” just described, but is associated witli a steam chamber on the top, to be used or not when required. This latter may be used for the cooking of vegetables, fish, and other foods, thus utilising the steam formed by the boiling water contained in the larger outside vessel, which heats the inner one. But the inner is used not only for stewing and boiling purposes, but also as a dry cooker; that is to say, a fowl or a portion its use in of meat being placed therein can be slowly cooked Poking, without water by a process occupying about twice or three times as long as that employed for ordinary boiling or roasting. In this case the flesh furnishes a quantity of liquid, slowly disengaged by low temperature, rising as vapour at first, and becoming condensed, with its own natural juices into a broth or gravy, in which, at the conclusion of the process, the flesh is found partially or wholly immersed. On the top of this floats more or less fat in a melted state, and this can be removed in the usual manner. No No loss by loss whatever takes place by this method. All the Cess Pr°* albumen, extractives, and juices of the flesh will be found in the inner saucepan when the process is com- pleted. Thus a most admirable and tender Irish stew How to may be made by placing, say about four pounds of neck irisb^sw of mutton, cut chiefly from the lower half of it in the tllus- usual way, with most of the fat removed, a little onion, sliced, adding no liquid whatever, only a little black pepper and salt to taste.

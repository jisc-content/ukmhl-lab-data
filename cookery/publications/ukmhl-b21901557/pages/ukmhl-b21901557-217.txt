Dumas Receipt for the Pot-au-Fcu 203 Dumas Receipt. By way of presenting a somewhat different view of the pot-au-feu, I subjoin the receipt of Alexandre Dumas, from the Dictionnaire cle Cuisine, his last work, and a posthumous publication. Dumas was an amateur cook of great experience, but, beyond a few favourite dishes, and one or two with which his name is always connected, he depended for his receipts in the large volume referred to, on his old friend Vuillemot, up to a comparatively recent date the famous proprietor of the pleasant quarters at St. Cloud, well-known as the The Noire. Of this work Dumas furnished, and very abundantly, all the literary material, a medley of popular scientific jottings with plenty of gossip and numerous anecdotes. It will be seen that for the pot-au-feu he adheres to the old tradition of an earthen pot; the real reason for which is, that at the ordinary fireplace, such a pot, being a bad heat conductor, favours slow and very gentle simmering better than an iron pot, which, on making only a small addition to the fire, is apt to boil briskly and so injure the broth. On a cooking-range, such as those now in general use, the iron pot is as manageable as one of earth, and is preferable for the reasons given by Couffe. While strictly adhering to the principle that thz pot-au-feu must consist of beef broth, and of a dish of beef to follow, Dumas admits some odds and ends to be added “in a horse-hair hag.” Even in this receipt, the hand of the amateur is visible ; for while giving instructions, and most con-ectly, not to put the meat into boiling water at first, which would harden the surface of flesh, and lock up the albumen within, the broth being impoverished in consequence, he omits to state that the mutton and veal, which he orders to be partially roasted before using [really in order to communicate the flavour so produced] must be subsequently sliced, otherwise their albumen, which is completely locked up by roasting, will not enter the broth, and the pot-au-feu will be a failure so far as

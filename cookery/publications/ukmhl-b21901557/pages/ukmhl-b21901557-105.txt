I think it may be said that soups, whether clear Soups (that is, prepared from the juices of meat and vege- ^y^any^ tables only), or thick (that is, purees of animal or vegetable matters), are far too lightly esteemed by most classes in England, while they are almost un- known to the working man. For the latter they might furnish an important cheap and savoury dish; by the former they are too often regarded as the mere prelude to a meal, to be swallowed hastily, or dis- regarded altogether as mostly unworthy of attention. The great variety of vegetable purees, which can be an im- casily made and blended with light animal broths, admits of daily change in the matter of soup to a diet for remarkable extent, and affords scope for taste in the ’ selection and combination of flavours. The use of fresh vegetables in abundance — such as carrots, turnips, parsnips, artichokes, celery, cabbage, sorrel/leeks, and onions—renders such soups wholesome and appetising.

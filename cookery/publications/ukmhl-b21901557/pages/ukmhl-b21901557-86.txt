Food and Feeding. 7 2 Nor- wegian cooker. No waste possible. Various illustra- tions of this. Becker’s process; Berlin. The cavity should he just large enough to hold the fowl in a vertical position, where it is to he imme- diately placed after the boiling, and water from the saucepan, about 206° or 208° by this time, or heated milk, is to he poured in to fill the cavity, for which about a quart is required. The apparatus is now accurately closed, and set aside in a corner, screened from draughts, hut not near to any source of heat, after which it is to remain untouched for at least twelve hours. On opening it the fowl will he found perfectly cooked and tender throughout, and the temperature of the liquor will he from about 120° to 130°. This should he set aside to cool, and when the fat is taken off it forms a more or less valuable contribution to the stock-pot. The initial boiling is of course intended to seal the surface, and to prevent the juices of the bird from escaping; hut some portion will of course find its way out into the surrounding liquid, and is to he utilised in the manner suggested, so that no particle is lost. The fowl can he served at once, masked with a good white sauce or otherwise, according to taste. Other applications of the same principle by which complete cooking is accomplished without hardening the albumenoid tissues of meat have been successfully adopted on a large scale, the most striking example being the apparatus patented by Becker, of Berlin (1882). The principle consists in ascertaining the temperatures best adapted for cooking each kind of food—for example, for making soup; for producing tender flesh, juicy, and not over-dried; and for

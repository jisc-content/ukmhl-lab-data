131 Fish and its Sauces. is not to bo had — and it rarely can be here. But the juice of the mushroom is preferred, in the form of catchup, and no doubt justly, by some, for the grill. Endless variations and additions may be made according to taste on these principles. But there is another no less important principle, viz., Fish that the fish itself often furnishes a sauce from its own juices, more appropriate than some of the com- furnish plicated and not very digestible mixtures prepared by ^uc^11 the cook.

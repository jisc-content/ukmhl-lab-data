87 Frying: Practical directions for. generally very imperfectly practised by the ordinary English cook. The products of our frying-pan are often and the greasy, and therefore for many persons indigestible, of process, the shallow form of the pan being unsuited for the process of cooking at a high temperature in oil, that is, at a heat of about 350° to 390° Fahr., that of boiling- water being 212°. This high temperature produces results, which are equivalent indeed to quick roasting, when the article to be cooked is immersed in the nearly boiling fat. Frying, as generally conducted, is rather a combination of broiling and toasting or scorching; and the use of the deep pan of heated oil or dripping, which is essential to the right perform- ance of the process, and especially in order to prevent greasiness, is a rare exception, and not the rule in ordinary kitchens. A few words of explanation are Practical necessary in relation to the temperature of the fat directl0ns- -which forms the frying bath, a matter of importance to ensure satisfactory results. When a bath of melt- ing fat is placed on the fire and the temperature has risen to 212°, some bubbles come to the surface with a hissing sound ; these are due to a small portion of water, which being converted into steam, rise until all is got rid of. This is not the boiling of the fat, which is now tranquil, and when the temperature has advanced much higher, to something like 340°, a slight vapour is given off. If the fat is permitted to become much hotter, smoke appears, indicating a degree of heat to be avoided, and that the fat has reached what is called the boiling point, when it decomposes and spoils. Before this is reached, the heat should be tested Jby

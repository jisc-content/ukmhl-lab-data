66 Food and Feeding. 2, for cooking a joint, commence with boil- ing; then a con- tinuous lower tem- perature. Experi- ment to ascertain able constituents, “ extractives,” and salts, will be found dissolved in the liquid also. See the process for making beef tea, which will be found in the Appendix. If, on the contrary, we desire to retain within the portion, say a leg of mutton, all its nutritive quality and its natural flavour, for a dish at table, the joint is to be immersed in a capacious pot of boiling water, to which a little salt has been added, in order at once to solidify, or coagulate as it is usually termed, the albumen which pervades the outer layer of the meat. The result of about seven minutes’ exposure to this temperature, upwards of 212°, as the addition of salt demands a higher temperature for boiling than plain water, is equivalent to enclosing the meat in an impervious casing, which effectually prevents the escape of albumen and flavouring matters into the water hereafter, however long the joint remains there. When the water has boiled for about seven minutes, nothing will be gained by maintaining that high temperature : it is on the contrary rather injurious than otherwise. The meat will be in better condition at table if the pot is removed a little from the fire, so that a temperature a few degrees below boiling is sustained for the usually necessary period of time required, which, of course, varies according to the size of the joint. Maintaining the water in a state of constant ebullition involves a large waste of fuel, and does not raise the temperature, either of the liquid or the meat a single degree. In order to ascertain what is the maximum tem- perature attained by “ boiling ” a leg of mutton in the

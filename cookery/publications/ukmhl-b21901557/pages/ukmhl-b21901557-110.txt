96 Food and Feeding. Soup nomen- clature ; varieties endless, species very limited, to wit; pages to the task of illustrating the elementary princi- ples of cookery which are involved in the process. By way of further illustrating the subject, I shall place there also some interesting instructions and com- ments from Dumas’ Grand Diciionnaire de Cuisine. It is not at all surprising that many persons should be somewhat bewildered by the almost endless variety of appellation under which the single article of soup is presented at table. It has been estimated that the titles which denote these numerous varieties, number altogether not less perhaps than five hundred. And proceeding on the principle on which these are pro- duced, there appears to be no reason why even the present list should not be doubled in length. In reality the number of species is very limited; but the slightest addition to a soup having been held sufficient to confer upon it a distinctive name, the idea of com- plexity and number has been unnecessarily fostered. Regarded analytically, there are but five leading species from which all varieties are produced by slight additions and combinations of flavour. 1. A clear decoction (weak, or “broth”; strong, or consomme) of meat: of beef, veal, sometimes mutton; and of pork in the form of ham or bacon. 2. A clear decoction of fowl. 3. A clear decoction of game. 4. A decoction of fish proper, and with shell fish (oysters, mussels, &c.) ; including “bisques.” 5. A decoction of vegetables only, comprising also herbs, roots, grains, and farinaceous substances.

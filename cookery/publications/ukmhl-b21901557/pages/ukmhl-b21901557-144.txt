130 Food and Feeding. A solo “ clean- ed ” is half wasted. The cook’s duty. Sauces, for fried and broiled fish. fillet, consisting of all the flesh, on either side of the central hone, both front and hack, was removed, making four from each fish. The whole skeleton, with the head, fins and tail, forming an entire piece, remains as “ cuttings ” in the shop. Now this piece will be found just equal to the fillets in weight, constituting in fact one half of the fish; and it will make excellent stock for soup, a form of food greatly neglected in this country. For in utilising fish, as far as possible, and in circumstances where a strict economy must be regarded, the soft parts of almost any fish may be cooked apart, so that the skeleton, head and fins may be utilised for stock, or better still, to make the foundation of the sauce in- tended to accompany the fish when served. It may be unnecessary to say that these parts are useless for that purpose when already cooked, as by boiling, frying, &c. As a general observation, it may be said that in pre- paring fish for the table by the cook, sufficient trouble is not taken to remove some portion of the bones; this can be advantageously done by a clever hand, without disfiguring or injuring the fish. Sauces should be appropriately served: for example, the fat sauces, as hollandaise, and other forms of melted butter, are an appropriate complement of hot boiled fish, while mayonnaise is similarly related to cold. These and their variations, which are numerous, may also ac- company both broiled and fried fish ; but the latter are often more wholesome and agreeable when served ■with only a squeeze of lemon-juice, and a few grains of the zest, if approved, when a fresh green lemon

93 The Pot-cm-Feu. by it, that I think an accurate description of what it really is may prove acceptable here. The pot-cm-feu is a composite dish which produces, “Pot-au- first a simple, but not strong, beef broth (bouillon), feu well flavoured by fresh vegetables; secondly, a some- what over-cooked and exhausted piece of beef (bouilli) which is served after the soup ; and, lastly, the vege- tables themselves. This is a different thing from the common “ stock- differs pot ” of the French peasant, so frequently termed a „ stock-6 pot-au-feu, and confounded with it. The primary pot,” object of a “ stock-pot ” is to make a decoction or basis for soup—of animal food, if possible—and every morsel of flesh, poultry, trimmings from joints, bones well bruised, &c., which are available for the purpose, are reserved for it. To the pot of the peasant, who wastes nothing whatever, all things are welcome; and every atom of nutritive material—solid or liquid— goes into it, to which are always added herbs and vegetables, together with the liquor in which any of the latter may chance to have been boiled. But some- times it is a pot mciigre, no meat of any kind having <<gras"or been procurable, and very good vegetable soups, “maigre” moreover, are educible therefrom, of which more hereafter. Then again, besides, or instead of the slices of bread which are usually put into the broth when served, the good wife now and then cleans a fresh cabbage, boils it in water, as much as possible of which she removes by pressure in a cloth, then puts the cabbage for a few minutes into her pot, and finally serves it as a welcome addition to the dish.

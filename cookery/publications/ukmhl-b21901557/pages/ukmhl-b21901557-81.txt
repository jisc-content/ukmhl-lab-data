Let me say that such experiments have been made many years ago, I believe thirty or forty. At least twelve or fifteen years have elapsed since it was repeated by myself in both boiled and roasted meats in order to ascertain by personal observation that in each case meat could be well cooked at the temperature named. But it has long been known that for the purpose of Lower thoroughly cooking flesh of any kind, there is no jju^^ccok necessity to maintain so high a temperature as that best if adopted by the ordinary method above described, tuners provided that the time of exposure to the lower degree given, of heat is considerably prolonged. There is a gene- rally accepted table, current in all cookery books, indicating the time which every joint requires, grounded on its weight; but this always presupposes the boiling point of water, of course to commence with, and almost boiling sustained by continual combustion of fuel afterwards. The flavour of animal food is, by the system previously referred to, better, and the meat itself more tender and more digestible ; a result which will inevitably bring into favour the practice of slow cooking when the best method of conducting it has been determined. That flesh so cooked is easily digested is due to the Why cook- fact that at the temperature of 170째 to 180째 the albumen ^|tat low

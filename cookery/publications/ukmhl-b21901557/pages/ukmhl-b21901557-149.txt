Baking and Boiling Fish. 135 been reached, the fish should be moistened by the addition of a little light stock before serving; and this is always done on the dish in which the cooking has taken place. The method is susceptible of innumera- ble variations to accommodate different tastes. Portions of fish prepared as fillets may be treated as well as entire fish ; garnishes of all kinds, as shell-fish, &c., may be added, flavouring also with fine herbs and condiments, according to taste. I may add that the Baking, process may be conducted in a properly ventilated ^ygs goot oven where a clear fire is really not to be had, pro- results, ducing a result nearly, although not quite equal, to true roasting ; or the dish may be first placed in the oven, and be finished before the fire, which is better. Cooked, however, as first described, such a dish may be welcome at any table; in preparing red mullet, for example, as just referred to, it is inimitable; while a fresh haddock or a dory, stuffed or not, take higher rank by being thus treated. But the working man also can thus advantageously cook before his kitchen fire, in a common Dutch oven, some fillets of plaice or skate with a slice or two of bacon; the dish to be filled or garnished with some previously boiled haricots, and by this means he may secure an economical and most savoury meal, which is at the same time nutritious. This is but a single illustration among many which might be adduced, of what may be done by this simple method for those whose resources are of the slenderest kind. Having regard to this question of economy and Boiling preserving the juices of the fish, it should never be wasteful process.

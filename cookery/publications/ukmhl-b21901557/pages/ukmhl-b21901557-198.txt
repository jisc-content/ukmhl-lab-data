On looking through the foregoing menus, it may be observed that the most substantial dish has been placed next after the fish, and that it is followed by the entree, after which comes the “ roast,” which in its turn is followed by the choice vegetable served apart. Those who prefer the entree before the substantial dish, can so arrange it; but whenever the latter happens to be roasted, as may sometimes be the case, it interferes most undesirably, by juxtaposition with the “roast” proper. This error may then be to some extent corrected by placing the choice vegetable be- tween the two, i.e. before the roast proper instead of after it; and this course should be taken whenever the first-named change is made. * A smooth puree of the red part of the carrot; the basis being a clear bouillon, thickened with tapioca.—Dubois. t A consomme of fowl, elegantly garnished.—Dubois.

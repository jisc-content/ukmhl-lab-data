198 Food and Feeding. Con- clusion. foregoing paragraphs were written for the first edition of this work, I am glad to note the improved facilities for obtaining country supplies which now exist, as compared with their absence at that period. Still, so rapidly do the area and population of our city increase, that the claim for more and better fresh food still increases almost in the same ratio as the improved supply. Have I claimed for the consideration of my subject too great a share in the thoughts and multifarious labours of busy men ? I think not. For myself, being not without serious occupations, an attentive study of it has agreeably occupied many leisure hours at home and abroad ; but it has furthermore performed good service in the interest of health. And if I have been rightly understood, this imperfect attempt to popularise a few undoubted truths in relation to the selection, the cookery, and the service of food, will bo regarded as a manifesto, which assuredly it is intended to be, on behalf of true temperance. In one word let me conclude:â€”if in professional life for some of us, the chief power lies in a skilled right hand, and in the temperament which pertains thereto, it is no less true that a practical acquaintance with the laws of diet and digestion becomes also a power in the combat with disease, not far inferior to the other in importance. My last word, then, no less than my first, shall testify to the value for all men of some knowledge in relation to their Food aud Feeding.

192 Food and Feeding. Recent im- provement and its cause. Have touched lightly many topics, which, were not the limits narrow, and better speeches would probably be secured than by the present mode. I confess this is rather an episode; but the subject of “toasts” is so interwoven with the management of the public dinner that I have ventured to introduce it. I even dare to think that the proposition may be not unlikely to receive the support of “the chair,” the duties of which, with a long array of toasts, are sometimes excessively onerous; only more so, be it recollected, in degree than those, of a humbler kind, which are entailed on many of the guests who are compelled to assist. Considerable improvement has taken place during the last few years in the manage- ment of public dinners. This is largely due to the influence of H.P.II. the Prince of Wales, who, when called on to preside at the annual festival of some important charity, which has been so fortunate as to obtain His Poyal Highness as their advocate, requires a menu reasonably limited, and the elimination of unnecessary toasts and speeches. In concluding this imperfect sketch of the very large subject indicated by the title employed, I desire to express my strong sense of its manifold shortcomings, especially by way of omission. Desiring to call atten- tion, in the smallest possible compass, to a great number of what appear to me to be important con- siderations in connection with the arts of selecting, preparing, and serving food, I have doubtless often failed to be explicit in the effort to be brief. It would have been an easier task were time at my disposal to illustrate these considerations at greater length,

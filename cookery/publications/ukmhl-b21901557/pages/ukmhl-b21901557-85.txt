Slow Process in the Norwegian Cooker. 71 joints may be cooked in tbe same manner in pots of appropriate size. But still lower temperature suffices if more time be devoted to tbe cooking; and this is advantageous where tbe material to be cooked is unusually tough. An illustration of this principle has been familiar to us here for many years, in tbe action of tbe Nor- Nor- wegian cooking apparatus; and most people know doling that by its means a prolonged moderate temperature apparatus, is completely effective in producing tenderly-cooked viands of various kinds. The following mode of using it may be adopted. Tbe details are those of a process employed in my own kitchen, tbe temperatures being taken by myself. Those given above of tbe Warren process have been verified by me in tbe same manner. A fowl weighing two and a half pounds is put into a four or five quart saucepan, boiling on tbe fire or gas stove. Ebullition ceases for half a minute, practical owing to tbe coldness of tbe body introduced, and directions then reappears: it should then be continued actively it. for six or seven minutes. Meantime, a Norwegian cooking apparatus, which may or may not be furnished with a tin liner,* filled with boiling water (which becomes about 200 degrees when ready for use); but the presence of a liner is certainly advantageous. * The “ liner” is merely a vessel adapted to the size of the bird or joint to be cooked, made of two cylinders, one surrounding the other, with a space of about three quarters of an inch to an inch between each, which can be filled with hot water, separate from that which is in the cavity containing the food to be cooked. A vessel so constructed is often said to have “ a hot-water jacket.”

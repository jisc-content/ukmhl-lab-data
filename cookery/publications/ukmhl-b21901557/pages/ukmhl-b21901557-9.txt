PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. During the last few years several large editions of this little book have been called for, and much new matter was added to one or two of them. A Sixth Edition being now required, I feel that the time has come to revise the work thoroughly. The art of cooking has, like other arts, been sedulously culti- vated, and has advanced, more perhaps in relation to the wants of the middle and working classes, than in the department generally understood as la haute cumne. Moreover, the selection and the service of food are certainly far better understood now, than they were fourteen or fifteen years ago, when the first edition appeared. A considerable part of the work, therefore, has been re-written. A new Chapter on Fish has been introduced. Considerable additions have been made in describing the methods of practical cookery, and in explaining the principles which determine them.

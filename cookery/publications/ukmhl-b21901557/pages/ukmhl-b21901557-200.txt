186 Food and Feeding. dishes, such as “joints,” “ turtle,” “ special soups,” and fish, oysters, &c., to save needless menu writing; are well known, and can therefore be adopted at pleasure by way of addition or exchange. Thus, none of the joints, such as sirloins, rounds, haunches, saddles, loins, shoulders, &c., have been named, with perhaps a single exception only. Everybody is familiar with English joints, which have been on this account ex- cluded from a list necessarily so restricted as the limits of only twenty-four menus demand. For the same reason I have not named turtle in any form, nor curries; nor such special soups as mock-turtle, mulligatawny, hodge-podge, split-pea,* giblet, watcr- soucliets, and fish soups; nor whitebait, nor the fresh-water fish, carp, tench, dace, pike, &c.; nor among sweets, tarts, ices, sorbets, and the farinaceous puddings, custards, &c.; nor have I named the preli- minary oysters, which may well be added during the season, September to April inclusive, as an additional luxury.

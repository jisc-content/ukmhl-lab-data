Of this gelatine, with some allied compounds, about gelatine, one to two pounds are present; but although nitro- genous compounds, they are distinct from the pre- ceding class of flesh formers, and possess much less nutritive value as food. Of fatty matters, about two to four pounds may bo fat. reckoned. The remainder consists of what are known as Extract- “ extractives,” and of various saline and even metallic iv?s and salts matters, all of which are essential parts of the animal body.

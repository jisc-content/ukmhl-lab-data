I do not mention this as a necessary item, but as one which must be decided by the lady of the house.” “ Observations on Beef a la Mode. “Beef a la mode is so useful and so justly appreciated in domestic cookery, that I think it will be worth while to recapitulate the principal details of the process, so that there may be no error in carrying it out. “ The important question, after the choice of the meat, is the cooking, which must be done entirely by slow sim- mering; and this is one of the most essential points for success. For when exposed to a hot fire the result is a white, watery, insipid gravy, such as is too often found in kitchens where cooking is carelessly done. The gravy ought to be red in colour, rather gelatinous in consis- tence, and full of the agreeable flavour and nutritive matter of both meat and vegetables, which is the distinc- tive mark of the dish. To obtain this excellent quality, the vegetables should be put into the braising pot at the proper time, so that all are cooked together. “ I advise in regard of all braised meats, whether beef or veal, that the portions should be rather too large than too small; a long process of cooking succeeds always better with such, than with tiny portions. A second ex- cellent dish can always be made cold with the addition of jelly. It appears to me better then to eat twice following of a good dish thus varied, than to cook the small quan- tity which suffices only for one meal.” * Soups made from Vegetables onhj. I append the following as an example of a good con- somme made from vegetables only, and therefore maigre ; if well done it is very fragrant and agreeable in warm weather.

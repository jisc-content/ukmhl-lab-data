It seems now to be almost overlooked that no Value of proper action of the intestines can take place unless a terrin^ very considerable quantity of inert matter is present in our daily food, existing as material which cannot be digested. By this character we are not to suppose that it is in the least degree “indigestible” in the sense of that term when employed to signify “ difficult diges- tion,” but only that it passes unchanged through the body, neither receiving nor exciting any action.

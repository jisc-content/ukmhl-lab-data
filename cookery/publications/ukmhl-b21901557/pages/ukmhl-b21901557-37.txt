Relation of Food to Climate. 2 3 In Spain, the inhabitants subsist chiefly on maize Spain, and rice, with, some wheat and legumes, among them the garbanzo or “ chick pea,” and one of the prin- cipal vegetable components of the national olla, which contains also a considerable proportion of animal food in variety, as bacon, sausage, fowl, &c. Fruit is fine and abundant; especially so are grapes, figs, and melons. There is little or no butter, the universal substitute for which is olive oil, produced in great quantity. Fowls and the pig furnish the chief animal food, and garlic is the favourite condiment. Going northward, flesh of all kinds occupies a more Different considerable place in the dietary. In France the necessary garden vegetables and legumes form an importantin North- staple of diet for all classes ; but the very numerous Europe, small land proprietors subsist largely on the direct France, products of the soil, adding little more than milk, poultry, and eggs, the produce of their small farms. The national pot-au-feu is an admirable mixed dish, in which a small portion of meat is made to yield all its nutritive qualities, and to go far in mingling its odour and savour with those of the fragrant vegetables, including sweet and savoury herbs, which are largely added to the stock. The beef, which is an essential portion of the dish, is often eaten hot after the soup, but sometimes cold, with plenty of green salad and oil, doubtless the most palatable mode of serving, while it furnishes a source of fat, if not otherwise provided for by butter, cheese, &c.* * For full details as to the nature and preparation of the pot-axi* feu, see page 92, and the Appendix.

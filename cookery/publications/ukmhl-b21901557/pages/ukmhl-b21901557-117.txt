103 Garnishes. should be a matter of consideration. Whether the Garni- dish he carved on the family table, as it rarely fails c^tinued to be when its head is interested in the cuisine, or whether it is handed in the presence of guests, the quality and the appearance of the dish greatly depend on the garnish. According to the meat may he added, with a view both to taste and appearance, some of the following—purees of sorrel, spinach, chicory, and other greens, of turnips, and of potatoes plain, in shapes, or in croquettes; cut carrots, peas, beans, endive, sprouts, and other green vegetables; stewed onions, small or Spanish; cucumbers, tomatoes,macaroni in all forms; sometimes a few sultanas boiled, mushrooms, olives, truffles. In the same way chestnuts are admirable, whole, boiled, or roasted, and as a puree freely served, especially in winter, when vegetables are scarce; serving also as farce for fowls and turkeys. While yege. such vegetables as green peas, French and young broad tables ^ beans, celery and celeriac, asparagus, seakale, cauli- << entre- flower, spinach, artichokes,salsify, vegetable marrows, mets” &c., are worth procuring in their best and freshest condition, to prepare with especial care as separate dishes.* * A hint about boiling asparagus is worthy of mention, since the proper method is rarely followed by English cooks. Asparagus of the stouter sort, always when of the “giant” variety, should be cut of exactly equal lengths, and boiled, standing ends upward, in a deep saucepan. Nearly two inches of the heads should be out of the water—the steam sufficing to cook them, as they form the tenderest part of the plant; while the hard stalky part is rendered soft and succulent by the longer boiling which this plan permits. Instead of the orthodox twenty minutes allotted to average asparagus lying horizontally, in the English manner, which half cooks the stalk.

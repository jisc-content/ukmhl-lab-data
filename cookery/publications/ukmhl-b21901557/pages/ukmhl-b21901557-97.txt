English and French Cookery compared. large extent, tlie ruling principle of French, cookery. Both are rational—each system, perhaps, the better of the two in its own place; and only illogical products and examples of defective taste can arise in practical cookery by confounding the two, an error however which is far from uncommon. In spite of the admiration which it is impossible to withhold for the talent of the French cook, it is nevertheless in France that the confusion I speak of is chiefly to be met with. And it is only in our own country, I venture to affirnq that the principle or system in question is carried out to perfection. The English principle is, that our own meat The Eng- and game shall be presented at table in the highest state lisl1 ldea’ of perfection attainable, so far as breeding, feeding, and keeping can accomplish it: each animal, when served, to be characterized by its own proper flavour, which is on no account to be masked or disguised by others, which are adventitious. Delicate additions perfect tending to heighten the natural flavour, or agreeably ]^^tlu lts subordinated to it, shall alone be admitted. It is a principle which can be successfully followed only where these meats exist in high perfection: where meat is inferior or insipid, an opposite treatment is the better one. And I do not hesitate to claim for the intelligent English consumer, that it has long- been essentially his aim to cultivate the best meat and game in the world, and to enjoy its intrinsic qualities for their own sake, unalloyed by any of those additions in the form of highly-flavoured sauce, which are so valuable for improving materials which do not possess their own distinctive fine qualities and flavours.

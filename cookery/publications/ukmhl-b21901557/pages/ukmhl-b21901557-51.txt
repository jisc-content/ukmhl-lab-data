37 Various methods of cooking Haricots. purpose they may be treated thus : Soak, say, a quart of the dried haricots in cold water for about sixteen to Haricots, twenty-four hours, after which place them in a saucepan, with two quarts of cold water and a little salt, on the fire; when boiling remove to the corner and simmer slowly until the beans are tender; the time required being about at least three hours.* This quantity will fill a Various large dish, and maybe eaten with salt and pepper, cooking3 °f It will be greatly improved at small cost by the addi- tion of a bit of butter, or of melted butter with parsley, or if an onion or two have been sliced and stewed with the haricots. A better dish still may be made by putting all or part, after boiling, into a shallow frying pan, and lightly frying for a few minutes with a little lard and some sliced onions. With a few slices of bacon added, a comparatively luxurious and highly nutritive meal may be made. But there is still in the saucepan, after boiling the haricots, a resi- due of value, which the French peasant’s wife, who turns everything to account, utilises in a manner quite incomprehensible to the Englishwoman. The water in which dried haricots have stewed, and also that in which green French beans have been boiled, according to locality and soil, and distributed over a very large part of Europe. When gathered early, before it is fully grown, the bean is green, like a green pea, and forms an admirable dish, known in France as flageolets. When the ordinary French beans (immature green pods) are mixed in about equal proportions with the flageolets, the dish, which is a very palatable one, is well known in France as haricots verts panaches (variegated), and might be served at eur tables with advantage. * If the water is hard, a little soda should be added to soften it.

A Receipt for whole-meal Cakes. 43 flat cakes (like tea-cakes), and baked on a tin, the rings used being about an inch high and seven or eight inches in diameter, each enclosing a cake. Put them without delay into a quick oven at the outset, letting them be finished thoroughly, at a lower temperature.* If made with yeast, which is for general purposes With preferable, when either good German or the fresh yeast' home product can be obtained, add the necessary quantity to the dough, made as above directed with the two meals, butter, salt, and warm milk and water ; make the cakes and put them on the tin with their rings, and set near the fire to rise, which they will do in an hour or little under. Then bake in a medium oven in the same way as for any other fermented bread. When yeast is used and not baking powder, a medium coarse oatmeal may be added to the wheat meal instead of fine oatmeal, which is necessary in the foregoing receipt. The butter and milk supply fatty matter in which the wheat is somewhat deficient; all the saline and mineral matters of the husk are retained; and thus a more nutritive form of bread cannot be made, combined with a desirable proportion of inert matter. * The following is a simple and excellent formula for “baking powder ; ” one which has been long used for this and other purposes. It may be obtained at any chemist’s and in any quantity, based on the following proportions : Tartaric acid, 2 ozs. Bicarbonate of soda, 3 ozs. Common arrowroot, 3 ozs. Mix well; place in a wide-mouthed corked bottle, and keep perfectly dry.

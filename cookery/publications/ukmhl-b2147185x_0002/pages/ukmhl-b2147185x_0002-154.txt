PUD PUD a cool place in the cloth they are boiled in, will keep good some months. When wanted, take them out of the cloth, and put them into a clean cloth, and as soon as warmed through they are ready." According to Soyer, every sort of pudding, if Bweot or savoury, is bettor dressed in a basin than a cloth. If boiled in a basin, the paste receives all the nutriment of the materials, which, if boiled in a cloth, are dissolved out by the water, when by neglect it ceases boiling. To cause puddings to tui-n out well, the inside of tli(! basin should bo thoroughly larded or rubbed with butter. In preparing meat puddings, " the first and most important point is never to use any meat that is tainted; for in puddings, above all other dishes, it is least possible to disguise it by the confined process which the ingredients undergo. The gradual heating of the meat, which alone would accelerate decomposition, will cause the smallest piece of tainted meat to contaminate the rest. Be particular also that the suet and fat are not rancid, always remembering the f^raud principle that everything which gratifies the palate nourishes." A pudding-cloth, however coarse, should never be washed with soap ; it should just be (h-ied as quickly as possible, and kept dry and tree from dust, and stowed away in a drawer or cupboard free from smell.

( 977 ) TIN ^IN slices of cold boiled^ beetroot. Pour over a mayonnaiso sauce made thus :—Take a basin, place therein three yolks of eggs, a little pepper and sjilt, and stir quickly with a wooden spoon. \\'ork into it by slow degrees half a pint of salad oil and half a gill of tarragon vinegar. If it is well made it should be firm and creamy. This quantity is enough for a very large dish. 95. Lauded Beef. Turn out a shape of beef with a larding- needlo, put Strips of fat bacon through from side to side. Serve when cold with gariush of parsley. 96. Sliced Beef and Cucumber. Lay thin slices of mutton or beef in a meat- dish, cut very thin slices of cucumber, and if wished a few sliced onions or shallots. Mix equal parts of oil and vinegar; shake them in. the bottle. When well mi.\ed put the cu- cumber into a basin, pour the oil and vinegar over, stii- till the cucumber is well covered with it, pepper, and pour it over the beef. 97. Gehmax Salad. Put in a salad-bowl a pound of beef cut in dice, also one finely-chopped onion, two ounces of red cabbage pickle, a pickled walnut chopped, two gherkins chopped, three ounces of boiled beetroot sliced and cold, two large white let- tuces, a little endive cut very fine, a little tarragon, chervil, a leaf or two of dandelion, half a dozen of sorrel, two large potatoes boiled and cut in slices cold, two sliced hard-boiled eggs, three table-spoonfuls of oil, six table- spoonfuls of vinegar, a tea-spoonful of sugar, two tea-spoonfuls of mustard, and a pint of claret or Khenish wine. Mix all well together, and decorate the top with a few shapes cut in beetroot. 98. MuTTOX AND Pickles. Turn out a 41b. shape of Australian mutton. Gai-nish the dish round with slices of red beet- root and little heaps of red cabbage pickle. 99. Cold Shape. Take two pounds of beef or mutton. Melt one ounce of Nelson's Gelatine, and add to it a tea-cupful of brown gravy or stock. Cut a hard-boiled egg into round slices, and line the bottom of a mould with it. Chop up some slices of fat bacon, season with pepper, salt, and a very little allspice ; add this to the meat with a little more liquid; place all in a stew- pan, and finish cooking. When done pour the whole into the mould and let it get quite cold. Dip in hot water the next day, and it will slide out at once. Garnish with a border of parsley. 100. Spiced Beef. Turn out a shape of beef of six pounds' weight. To answer properly it should be a firm good shape with plenty of jelly round. It must be cut in rounds three inches thick— this will make three rounds. Lay them in a dish three inches deep, cover them with this mixture:—One ounce of popper, one ounce of salt, half an ounce of nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce of allspice. Melt all the jelly, put the rounds back intact into their own tin, one over the other. To accomplish this you must press each round down separately with a piece of '•wood that just fits inside the tin. When it is all firmly pressed in, pour (by degrees to let it soak in) aU round the edge the melted jolly well seasoned. Let the shape stand to get cold. If it will not turn out easily, dip it in hot water.

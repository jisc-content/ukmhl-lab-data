" But water, to the extent of between fifty and sixty-nine per cent., is contained in the food consumed, raising the amount to about forty ounces." Now, nearly the whole of the nitrogen and carbon contained in the chief articles of our food may be thus divided and distributed :— Lean Raw Meat Fat of Meat . Egg Cheese Butter Bread Potatoes . Other Vegetables MUk Sugar 16 oz. less one-fifth bone, 14-4=cookcd, about 8 oz. i 2 1 1 18 16 8 2 f oz. 5> Having thus arrived approximately at the quality and quantity of the several kinds of food required by an adult man of average size and weight, and in moderate work, it next becomes important to ascertain how each person may calculate for himself, and so ascertain the nutritive quality of his own or any other dietary. This important object may be accom- plished by the help of the following table from the work of Dr. Parkes, before quoted:— Table fok Calculating Diets. drates. Salt.

The quantity by weight of any of the articles enumerated being known, the amounts of the albuminates, fats, and carbo-hydrates are easily calculated by a simple rule-of-three sum. Thus, supposing the allowance is twelve ounces of meat, one-fifth ftiust be deducted for bone, the water in the remaining 9 6 ounces will bo 75 X 9-6 ascertained as follows: = 7'2, and so on for the other constituents." The following tables, for which we are in- debted to the Catalogue of the Bethnal Green Food Collection, will be found highly interesting.

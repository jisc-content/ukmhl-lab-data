PRO ( 657 ) PRO about one-lifth of the amount montionod in tho above table. "It is not to bo understood from this," say the compilers of tho Catalogue, "that taking one pound of cod-liver oil would enable a man to lift one-fifth of 6,649 tons (that is, 1,130 tons) one foot off. the ground. What is meant is that that is the total mechanical work which the combustion in the body of one pound of the oil is capable of producing outside the body, supposing its effect to be wholly expended in the production of this mechanical work without any waste. Moreover, this statement of the amount of work in tons hfted one foot does not take time at all into account. It simply reckons the total work which it is possible to get out of the combustion of one pound of cod-liver oil, no matter how long it may take to do it." The two following tables Illustrate the application of the above data, the first giving the weight and cost (1866) of various articles of food required to be oxidised in the body in order to raise 140 lbs. to the height of 10,000 feet.

The former seems more allied to our nature, and is most easily assimilated to our nourishment; the latter, though digested with more difficulty, is the foundation of the former, as vegetables are the nourishment of animals, and all food is therefore properly derived from this source. The diet best suited to preserve a perfect state of health appears to be a combination of animal and vegetable food. There are few, says a medical authority, who subsist entirely on vegetables, and of these few the constitu- tions have generally inferior stamina. In hot climatea a vegetable diet may be carried to a great ^ptent without injury; while, on the other hand, some northern nations live almost entirely on animal food, and in a very cold atmosphere this may be indulged beyond what would otherwise be safe for the health of the body, so that a mixture of vegetable and animal nourishment appears best fitted for the health of mankind in general. In the matter of diet we are liable to commit errors, both as regards its quantity and quality. The error in the quantity is ordinarily the worse of the two. It should never be forgotten that we are not nourished, as Dr. Abernethy used to say, by what we eat, but by what we digest. Nature is easily satisfied, and is usually best provided for when we do not intrude upon her more than a small and mo- derate quantity of the most digestible animal and vegetable food, at regular intervals of four hours through the day. As to the quantity of food to be actually taken that must be regulated altogether by the appe- tite, the supply required, and the condition of health of the individual. The natural con- sequence of repletion is satiety, and before this takes place the stomach itself gives timely warn- ing. The weak, delicate, and sedentary require less food than the strong, robust, and active; infants need less than children, and children than adults. " There can be no doubt," remarks Dr. Graham, " that the majority of the more respectable inhabitants of Groat IBritain eat and drink twice as much as is necessary and bene- ficial; and this is nearly equally true of the same class of persons in most of the othei

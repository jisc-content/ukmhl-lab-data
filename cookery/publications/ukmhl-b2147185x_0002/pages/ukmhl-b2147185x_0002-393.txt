( 903 ) SOtr SOU" eighteen parts of rye-meal, and continue heat- ing and stirring, so as to make the mass brown; add then foui- pju'ts of diied salt and two parts of coarsely pulverised airaway-seeds. The mix- ture is then poured into tin pans somewhat like those used for making chocolate into cakes. The cakes have the appearance of chocolate, and are chiefly intended for the use of boldiers when in the field. A quantity of about an ounce of this preparation is sufficient to yield, when boiled with some water, a ration of good soup, and in case of need, the cakes being agreeable to the taste, may be eaten raw. Soup Without Stock.—Cut a good-sized cabbage, put it in a stewpan with some carrots, onions, celery, and the bono of a leg of mutton or rib of beef from which all the meat has been taken. Add a quart of water, and let all simmer together for five hours. Then strain the soup, and take oft" any fat which may still float on it. Pick out the best pieces of cabbage, put them into the soup, season with pepper and salt, make quite hot, and serve.

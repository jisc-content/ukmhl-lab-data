88 THE BREAKFAST BOOK. PICKLED OX PALATES. Simmer ox palates for four hours in a liquor sea- soned with salt and spices; take them up, pack them in jars, strew spices upon them, and pour over them equal quantities of white wine and strong vinegar ; add a few bruised bay leaves, and cover close. Cocksâ€™ combs also are excellent pickled, but require less dressing than the ox palates. PICKLED PARTRIDGES OR PIGEONS. Bone them, lard them with ham or tongue on the inner side, rub plenty of spices into them ; trass them in what fashion you please. Plunge them for two or three minutes into boiling water; drain and dry them. Boil together equal quantities of Madeira wine and vinegar, with some pepper, nutmeg, and bruised bay leaves. Put in the birds, simmer them for twenty minutes; take them up, boil and skim the pickle a little longer, and when all is cold put it together in stone jars; cover them down securely. PICKLED THRUSHES OR SNIPES. Carefully pluck the birds, cut off the heads and feet, and roast or bake them, but do not baste them.

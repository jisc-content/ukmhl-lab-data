70 THE BREAKFAST BOOK. TRUFFLE SAUSAGES. To one pound of lean pork add half a pound of bacon fat and three ounces of fresh truffles; season â– with salt and spices; chop it fine; mix with it a glass of champagne or some lemon-juice, and proceed as with other sausages. VEAL SAUSAGES. Take one pound each of lean veal and bacon fat, four anchovies, the hard-boiled yolks of four eggs, a little powdered sage, pepper, salt, and the juice of a Seville orange. Pound all in a mortar, and put into skins. VENISON OR GAME SAUSAGES. Yenison, hare, pheasant, or any kind of game is suitable. Take two pounds of the raw flesh, carefully remove every particle of skin, sinew, etc., and mince the meat with half its weight of very sound bacon fat. Season it well with salt and pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and a glass of brandy. Make them up in skins, or with the addition of egg, roll them in flour, and fry them, first dipping them into butter and bread crumbs. Capital sausages are made with the flesh of rabbits, kid, goose, or turkey.

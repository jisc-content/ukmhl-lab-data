In the South of Europe salt her- rings are divested of their heads and tails, then put into boiling water for ten minutes, and afterwards served with very thin slices of lemon or sour apples and onion; olive oil and mustard apart. SAUSAGES. It is the usual practice to simply toss sausages in lard or butter, for if broiled they are apt to become smoky before they are properly done. As they take some time to cook, first prick them with a needle to prevent the skins from breaking. Garnish with pickled red cabbage, or apples sliced and tossed till nicely browned. Observe that underdone sausages are execrable. SLICES OF HAM. There is, after all, hardly anything more accept- able to the epicure than a savoury rasher of ham. It should be broiled upon or toasted before a brisk fire, then rubbed over with fresh butter, and sprinkled with pepper. Eggs fried or poached may be served with the ham if approved of. If you have reason to believe that the ham is too salt, dip the rashers for a moment or two into boiling water before cooking. See also Ham Cake, Ham Toast, Omelettes, Ham Pie, etc.

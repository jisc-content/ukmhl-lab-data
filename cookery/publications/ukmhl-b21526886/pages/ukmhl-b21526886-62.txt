TIIE BREAKFAST BOOK. 46 Parmesan cheese, or some shred shalot sprinkled over the meat; but such peculiar flavours had better be avoided, though, if you can manage it, a gravy made from game of any kind, especially hare, is a material improvement. calf’s-feet pie. There are sweet as well as savoury calfs-feet pies ; the former are composed of currants, candied peel, wine, etc. For the latter, boil a pair of feet in plenty of water, until you can remove the bones easily, then line a terrine with thin slices of fat bacon, over this spread some rich forcemeat, put in the meat of the feet, add some mushroom-powder or truffles sliced, and some thin slices of cold tongue or smoked sausage, season well with pepper. Pour in a little strong gravy and a glass of brandy, cover with more forcemeat and bacon fat, put on the top of the terrine, and bake for an hour and a half in a rather slow oven. The flavour may be varied by substituting oysters, caviare, or other things, fur the tongue, truffles, etc. Remark; the liquor in which the feet were boiled can be converted into jelly, but should not be put into the pie. Calves’ sweetbreads, or kidney sliced, seasoned, tossed in butter, and mingled with the calf’s feet, will be found to imjirove the pie greatly.

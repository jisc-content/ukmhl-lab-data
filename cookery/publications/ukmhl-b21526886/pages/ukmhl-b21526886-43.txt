When tossed without the bacon, a glass of wine may be poured into the pan, and served in the dish, with the liver arranged en couronne round. CAPILOTADE OF POULTRY. This is a speedy way of warming up cold roasted fowl, turkey, rabbit, or pigeon. Chop up some shalot, and, if you have them, three or four mushrooms, sprinkle them over with flour, fry them in butter, and add two tablespoonfuls of gravy with some pepper and salt, and a glass of white wine. Cut up the meat, and simmer it for a quarter of an hour in this pre- paration. Serve with a garnish of pickled gherkins. CIVETS OF GAME. A civet is merely an expeditious method of dressing the flesh of hare, rabbit, or venison. Cut it into mo- derately small pieces. Toss a few slices of bacon in butter until both are well browned, put in the venison* hare, or rabbit, do it over a brisk fire for five minutes, add some capers and ready-dressed small onions, also herbs and mushrooms; let it simmer for nearly twenty minutes, and serve with sippets of toast round the dish. Remember the sauce should not be thickened in any way, except that the blood from the hare may be added.

THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 108 GALANTINE OF SALMON. _ Take from a large salmon a prime piece, of at least eighteen inches in length; clean it thoroughly; oqien it at the stomach, bone it as perfectly as possible, and with a large needle insert upon the inner side fillets of preserved tunny fish, anchovies, and pickled gher- kins ; stuff it with the boned meat of any other fish you can procure, adding some pickled prawns, oysters, lohsteis, etc., well seasoned. Give the piece of sal- mon its original form, fasten it securely together, tie it tight in a cloth, and boil it in vinegar and water until it is done. Let it grow cold in the liquor, remove the cloth, glaze the fish, decorate it with hits of jelly and sippets of toast, and serve cold. This is esteemed a very elegant dish for the breakfast-table, and is not extravagantly expensive when salmon is plentiful. HOT CRAB. Pick the meat from the shell, beat it in a mortar, add a few bread-crumbs, pepper, nutmeg, a spoonful each of strong gravy and cream. Warm it well, and serve it upon hot toast, with plenty of lemon-juice squeezed over it.

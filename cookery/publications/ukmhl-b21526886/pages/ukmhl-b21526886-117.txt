THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 101 FISH TOSSED, OR SAUTE. Fish is not often cooked whole in this manner, ■unless it he the smaller kinds, hut fillets from the following fish may he successfully saute—shad, silver eels, pike, carp, mackerel, whiting, gurnet, salmon, soles, turbot, trout, skate, conger, pressed caviare, etc. The fillets should he nicely trimmed, skinned, and in most cases seasoned and sprinkled over with finely-chopped herbs, then tossed, or as English cooks would term it, fried in oil, lard, or clarified butter. When thus dressed the fish should he well drained from the friture, and served with a gravy or a sauce apart. Slices of cold fish may he quickly warmed up in this way. FISH AU GRATIN (WITH BREAD-CRUMBS). Take some ready dressed fish of any kind, slice it, and, if possible, hone it; dip it into either oil, cream, or melted butter; season it; place it in a dish upon a piece of buttered toast, sift grated bread upon the top, and place it in an oven until sufficiently browned. Serve upon the toast with a garnish of sliced lemon. One-third the quantity of rasped Parmesan cheese added to the bread-crumbs is a material improve- ment.

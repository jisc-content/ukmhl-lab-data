THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 102 BAKED FISH. Several descriptions of fish eat well when baked; bnt for the breakfast table it seldom appears hot when thus treated. As for this method of serving, it should be accompanied with a forcemeat, and be baked in a deep dish with plenty of cream, oil, or white wine. Trout, carp, bream, jack, cutlets of salmon, etc., are exceedingly good done in this way. When we intend it to be eaten cold we should season it well, and simply bake it with half vinegar and half water in the dish, or baste it with olive oil, white wine, or lemon-juice. Pieces of sturgeon, shad, salmon, bass, etc., are excellent dressed thus, and will keep for some time. Serve it upon the liquor, and let there be a cold sauce apart. FISH BOASTED. Sturgeon, lobster, pike, eels, and lampreys, are occasionally introduced among the entrees at a break- fast, roasted. The three latter should be first stuffed with a forcemeat made with shrimps, oysters, etc.; then curled round with their tails in their mouths, and skewered securely to keep them in shape. Place them before the fire and baste with butter. Serve with a sauce piquante. Lobsters should be finely frothed.

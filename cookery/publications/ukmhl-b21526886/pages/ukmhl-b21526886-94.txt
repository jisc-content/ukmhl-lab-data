78 THE BREAKFAST BOOK. s CHAPTER VI. Collahed, Pickled, axd Potted Meat, etc. BEEF 1 LA MODE. Choose a piece of the round of veiy tender beef, lard it, and braise it in a liquor made by the addition of a calfs foot, knuckle of veal or beef bones, herbs, spices, white wine, bruised bay leaves, and a glass of brandy. Let it do slowly for six hours. Take it up. Clarify the gravy until it forms a fine jelly, and gar- nish your meat with it when cold. Some cooks elaborate this dish by stuffing the beef with a rich forcemeat, but this method is not correct. When wine cannot be bad use a little very good ale. The jelly may be coloured red with a small quantity of cochineal. An easy way of braising is to place the meat, with the necessary adjuncts, in a pot, tie it down with thick oiled paper, and place it for some hours in a moderately heated oven.

THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 02 times served as a sweet pie, by employing raisins, grocersâ€™ currants, candied fruit, etc., in its composi- tion. A savoury veal pie is improved by a few stoned olives and the yolks of some hard-boiled eggs. It should be highly seasoned with red and white pepper, nutmeg, etc. Bake according to size. VENISOX PIE. Cut your meat into moderately small pieces; boil down the bones to make gravy. Season the meat, and properly distribute the fat and the lean in a dish edged with crust. Pack the venison pretty close, cover with a lid of crust, and bake slowly for four hours. If preferred, the venison may be first jugged for two or three hours, to make it tender, and after- wards put into a raised pie. WOODCOCK PIE. Pick clean and singe your birds; take out the trail, make it into a forcemeat with the livers, some bacon fat, etc. Split open the woodcocks at the backs, rub butter upon them, dust them plentifully with pepper, and broil them a little over a clear fire. When cold, lard them and make them into a raised pie in the usual way. Snipes similarly treated are excellent.

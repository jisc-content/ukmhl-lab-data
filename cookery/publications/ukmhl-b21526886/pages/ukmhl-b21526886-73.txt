By way of variety, half the pork may be made into sausage-meat, adding a little dried sage, and enveloping morsels of it in thin fillets of the remainder of the pork. For family use, delicious pies are made by frying a porkerâ€™s liver in butter, and when cold pounding it in a mortar, to- gether with a corresponding weight of bacon fat, and some spices; blanch the brains of the porker, and slice them, as well as the two kidneys and some of the lean meat. Season all well. Lay the forcemeat of liver inside a raised crust, put in the meat and one or two bruised bay leaves; add a lid of crust, and bake it for two or three hours, according to size.

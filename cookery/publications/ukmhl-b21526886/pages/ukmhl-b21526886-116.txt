THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 100 wo ordinarily cook beef-steaks, mutton-chops, bacon and eggs, etc. For things that are fried, foreign cooks use either oil or a regular friture composed of equal parts of hogâ€™s-lard, fresh veal-fat, and beef- suet melted down together, and kept in pots for use. This is greatly to be preferred to lard or butter, from the fact that lard frequently contains a large amount of water and salt, and butter a considerable propor- tion of curd, all of which conduce to make the frying-pan sticky, and thereby discolour whatever is cooked in it, which never happens when oil or friture is used. The fish you require to fry should be well cleaned and wiped dry, and if thick it should either be split open or scored across in the most fleshy parts; pass it through some flour and fiy it in plenty of friture, if you object to oil; but be parti- cular that the fat boils before putting in the fish. Bread-crumbs or batter, etc., may take the place of flour. Fried fish should always be served upon a white napkin folded at the bottom of the dish, and garnished with either sliced lemon or crisp parsley. Such as smelts, sprats, etc., should be arranged en buisson, by inserting a small basin beneath the napkin in the dish, and placing the fish to stand with their tails upwards against the support formed for them to rest against.

THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 113 PICKLED OYSTERS. Shell and trim the beards from the oysters; put them, with their own liquor, into a stewpan, simmer them for about a quarter of an hour; then take out the oysters, strain the liquor, and add to it twice its measure of strong vinegar, some salt, pepper- corns, and mace; boil this up, and when quite cold pour it upon the oysters, and tie them down in jars. POTTED FISH. Clean and wipe your fish dry, but do not wash it; cut off the head, tail, and fins, and, if you prefer it, extract the bones. Cut the fish into lengths, and season with a sufiiciency of powdered cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt; pack the pieces in pots, cover with a coarse paste, and bake slowly till done. Kemove the paste, drain the fish from the gravy, and next day pour clarified butter upon it. Some cooks bake the fish with some butter with it, or a little strong vinegar is sometimes added in the baking, and afterwards poured off; but the foregoing method suc- ceeds equally well. Eels and lampreys should be skinned before being potted; carp, trout, tench, salmon, herrings, mackerel, pike, smelts, char, and perch are most usually potted, as well as the flesh of lobsters, prawns, and shrimps. i

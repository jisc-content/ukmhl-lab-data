THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 43 salad-bumet, mustard and cress, chives, and a tea- spoonful of capers, half a dozen gherkins, two ounces of preserved tunny-fish, and half a dozen anchovies. Pound all to a paste, then add a pound of the best fresh butter, two ounces of olive oil, and the juice of a lemon. Season with Cayenne pepper, mix well together, and keep it in a cool place. REM0LADE SAUCE. With equal quantities of oil and vinegar, mix a table-spoonful of the best mustard; add the raw yolks of two eggs, and a tea-spoonful each of finely- shred shalots and savoury herbs. Season with pep- per and salt, and use as wanted, either for a salad mixture, or as a sauce for cold meat. A Tartar sauce is similar to the above, but omitting the eggs. SHRIMP OR TRAWN BUTTER. After picking them from their shells, pound the fish in a mortar, add a corresponding weight of fresh butter and some Cayenne pepper. Place the mixture in a bain-marie, and when the butter is melted, pass it through a strong sieve. Servo it cold as a hois dâ€™ceuvre. Remark : if intended to be kept for any length of time, the butter employed should have been previously clarified.

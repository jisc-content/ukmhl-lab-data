117 TI-IE BREAKFAST BOOK. about three pounds of fish, beat together one ounce of fine white pepper, a saltspoonful of cayenne, three pounded nutmegs, a tablespoonful of salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, a clove of garlic, a small piece of mace, and a teaspoonful of pimienta (not pimento). Make holes in the fish with your finger, and charge them well with the mixture ; rub it also on the oxit- side. Heat some olive oil in a frying-pan, fry the fish of a fine brown ; then put it into pots, just cover them with strong vinegar, and fill up with fresh oil; tie them down with skins, and the pickle will keep a long time and be found an excellent relish for break- fast. TO CURE SALMON. Draw and split open a fine fresh salmon; wipe it well inside and out, but on no account wash it. Sprinkle it plentifully with brown sugar, and let it remain a day or two ; then rub it over with a small quantity of salt and pounded saltpetre. When this has become pretty well absorbed, wipe the fish, hang it up for a short time in an airy place, and afterwards smoke it slowly.

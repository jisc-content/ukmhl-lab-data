THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 81 COLLARED SUCKING PIG. Choose a very nicely-cleaned sucking pig ; bone it entirely, rub the inside with pepper, salt, and powdered herbs; roll it up as tight as possible, bind it in a cloth, tie it securely, and put it into a boiling liquor made with water, a quart of vinegar, a hand- ful of salt, some cloves, mace, pepper-corns, and savoury herbs. Boil softly till tender. Take it out, and when nearly cold tighten the bandage; place the pig in a pan, and pour over it the cold liquor in which it was boiled. Some housekeepers put the pig into a sort of caudle made of oatmeal, white wine, and spice, but this proceeding is not absolutely necessary. COLLARED VEAL. Bone a largo fat breast of veal; rub it over with egg, and strew upon it spices, salt, shred herbs, lemon peel, and an anchovy, or small slices of pickled tongue or ham. Add likewise, if convenient, the meat from a boiled pair of calvesâ€™ feet. Boll it very tight in^ cloth, and tie it securely with tape. Sim- mer it for three hours in salt and water. When cold put it into a pickle of vinegar, and water enough to cover it. G

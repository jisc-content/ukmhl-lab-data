95 THE BREAKFAST BOOK. VEXIS0X BEEF. Take six pounds of tender beef, cut it up, rub into it four ounces of brown sugar, and one of powdered saltpetre. Let it lie two days. Wipe it dry, and put it to soak for twenty-four hours in equal parts of red wine and vinegar. Drain it well and bake it, with the addition of a good deal of fresh butter, until the meat is perfectly tender. Take it up, and when cold beat it to a paste in a mortar, using with it the cold butter from the dish in which it was baked. Add pounded cloves, cayenne, and black pepper. Place it in pots in the usual way.

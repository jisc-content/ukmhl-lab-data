Take the fish as soon as they come out of the water, and either nab them well with salt or dip them for a moment or two in boiling water, so as to make them easier to clean. Draw them, and lay them in a pie- dish, with a layer of butter under them, strew pepper and salt over them, pour in a little wine or tarragon vinegar, place some butter on the top, and finish with a lid and rim of crust. A few fresh or pickled mushrooms are a great improvement. TROUT OR GRAYLING PIE. Make a forcemeat with hard-boiled eggs, anchovy, spices, mushrooms, yolk of egg, and fresh butter; stuff your fish with part of it, and make the rest into balls. Prepare your ciaist, place in the fish, etc., and fill up with pieces of silver eel boned; cover with slices of butter and a top of crust. It may be made into a raised pie, if preferred. Bream also makes a capital pie in this manner. Bake for an hour.

THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 72 GALANTINES. Capon, duck, goose, hare, lamb, sucking-pig, partridge, pheasant, rabbit, salmon, turkey, veal, venison, and Welsh mutton, are among the things chiefly made into galantines. Much the same mode of operation is pursued in regard to each. The piece of meat is to be carefully boned, seasoned inside, and filled with forcemeat, pieces of tongue, sausage, game, bacon fat, truffles, etc., put in layers. Sew it up, try to make it retain its original form, fasten it securely in a cloth, and do it for some hours in a rich consomme. Let it grow cold in the liquor, which should subsequently bo reduced, clarified, and in the form of jelly used as a decoration to the galan- tine. Serve it upon a white napkin. The two shoulders of Welsh mutton should be employed to make a galantine; either the breast or shoulder of veal also answers for the same purpose. The heads of sucking-pigs, hares, and rabbits, should not be boned. Hard-boiled yolks of eggs, oysters, blanched sweet almonds, chesnuts, pistachio nuts, foies gras, veal fat, garlic, bay leaves, lemon-juice and rind, chopped pickles, anchovies, etc., enter into the com- position of the stuffing. When well executed, a galantine is a very handsome dish for any kind of collation. It is invariably served cold. Easped bread may be used to mask it with if you cannot glaze it.

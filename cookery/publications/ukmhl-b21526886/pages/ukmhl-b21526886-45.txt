Some sliced mushrooms are a great improvement. Cold rabbit, hare, sweetbreads, poultry, ox palates, calvesâ€™ brains, foie gras, veal, and different kinds of fish, are specially adapted for coquilles. Serve in the shells. CURRIES.

Eabbit, too, is par- ticularly good curried; but it is an unpardonable error to make use of flour in the composition of this dish. When cold meat is warmed up as a curry, it is only requisite to cut it up, and toss it in butter, then pour in some curry, mixed in either wine, gravy, milk, or lemon-juice and water. It may subse- quently be thickened with tomato sauce, yolks of eggs, or cream. Fried onions, apples or cucumbers are often added. Serve surrounded with capsicums or other strongly-spiced pickles.

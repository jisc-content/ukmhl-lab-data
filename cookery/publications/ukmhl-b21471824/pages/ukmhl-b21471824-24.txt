Philosophy of Housekeeping. should first go and order anything required for the bouse, then return visits, or take a good constitutional until four o'clock. From four to five write letters, or road for an hour (serious reading, leaving light reading for evening). At five, when necessary, go downstairs to speak to cook, glance round to see all pre- parations are getting forward for the six o'clock dinner; then go upstairs, inspect the housemaid's performance of needlework, always laid in your room for that purpose, and dress for dinner. Go into the dining-room, and see all is read}', put out the wine, arrange dessert and flowers. Then be ready at a quarter to six to receive le mari, and see that he has his hot water, slippers, &c. At six, dinner, after which coffee and amusements of music, reading, cards, or needle- work of a light nature. 35. Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings may be devoted to the garden and plants, the afternoon to walking or driving as before, or any particular hobby or study. 36.

First, she must purchase an ordinary water-butt, provided with a tap near the bottom, and with a removable Ud ; the water from the roof passes naturally through an ordinary pipe into this butt. A tank, about ten feet deep and four â–  feet in diameter, bricked and cemented, must be provided as near as possible to this, and from the water-butt to the tank a pipe is carried, one end of it being cemented in the tank, the other carried up to within six inches of the top of the* water-butt, and fitted with a rose. As soon as the water-butt is filled, the waterr flows down the pipe into the tank ; a common pump in the house brings it in- fresh and clean, ready for use. "But how clean?" asks an anxioi.s matron.

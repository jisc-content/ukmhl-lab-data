Chop the brains and mix them with the stuffing ; add ^ pint cf good gravy, a tablespoonful of lemon- juice, and the gravy that flowed from the pig ; put a little of this on tho dish with the pig, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Place the jDig back to back in the disfa, with one half of the Lead on each side, and one of the ears at each end, and send it to table as hot as possible. Instead of butter, many cooks take salad oil for basting, which makes the crackling crisp; and as this is one of the principal things to be considered, perhaps it is desirable to use it; but be particular that it is very pure, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat. The brains and stuffing may be stirred into a tureen of melted butter instead of gravy, when the latter is not liked. Apple sauce and tho oid-fashioned cur- rant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an accompaniment to roast pig. Time.— 1^ to 2 hours for a small pig. Average cost, 5s. to 6s.

xz Philosophy of Housekeeping, 123. By the Style of House, and the class of ]a(3y, one can jurlge of the sen'ant'g character, whether the lady gives a true character or not. High praise is oftea accorded by a mistress who does not know what a good servant is, and applies particularly to cooks, for hero taste and style of serving differ essentially. As a rule, a lady is safe in taking a servant who has lived over two years in family in the same position as her own, neither above nor below it, of whom the mistress distinctly and clearly states that she is honest, sober, clean, and indi trious ; the mistress's appearance being quiet, ladylike, and tidy ; the house well cared for and neat. It is a great advantage to know something of the past histo" of one's servants, and inquiries should bo made respecting the other places hel by the servant. 121.

They soon see if "mi is " paiiiicular" or no, and whether they are ruled by a careful, clever handJ or by a careless, idle, anyhow mistress, and will act accordingly. 128. What has passed into a proverb respecting the master's eye equally appli to the mistress of a household. Her observant glance ought to take in, an the mind note, every detail of housewifery.

Ixiii Furnitiire Polish. 416. The Z)i7iMi^-j-oom—that is, the weekly cleaning of it, falls to the cook'u share. 417. The Drawing-room—io the housemaid. 418. The Breakfast Parlour—io the housemaid. 419. All attendance, except the waiting at breakfast, which the cook does while ,he housemaid is engaged with the bedrooms, falls to the housemaid. Answering loor before twelve, the cook ; afterwards the housemaid. 420. The Glass and the Plate are exclusively the housemaid's care. 421. The Knives are washed by the cook when she washes the other things, but leaned by the housemaid. 422. The Table-Unen is also the housemaid's care, as is the mending of linen oing and returning from the wash. 423. The Boots and Shoes.—The cook does the gentlemen's, the housemaid the idies' boots and shoes. 424. The Washing.—This is divided ; generally the housemaid does all the finer lings, the cook the coarser and heavier, the housemaid having all the starching id ironin'j. But if the cook wore a very good ironer, it would be better for Br to take that, and the housemaid to do more at the washtub. But it is Imost impossible to lay down any definite rules for this department of work, 1 it must depend entirely on the extent of the washing done at home and the bilities of the servants. One general rule for all the work—Both tho cook and pusemaid should be obliging to each other, and endeavour always to facilitate (.oh other in their several duties. And though it is desirable that they adhere much as possible each to her own department of work, j'et neither should Iject, in case of her fellow servant being ill, or getting leave to go out, to Irform her duties for her. 425.

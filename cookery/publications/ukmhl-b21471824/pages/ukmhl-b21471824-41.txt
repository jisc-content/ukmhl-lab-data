The Children. new flannel, and some bandage strips should also be placed close at hand. Nurse should be provided with two enamelled saucepans, with a block-tin kettle with neat jars, containing sugar, pearl barley, Embden grits, mustard, linseed, and linseed-meal. She should keep a bottle of camphorated spirits, and of ipecacuanha wine ; also among her medicines she should have a store of night- lights, a food-warmer, and some candles; a tin of plain biscuits may also be placed in her charg;e. 138. Both Nurse and Mother should inspect the stores once a week, and see that nothing is wanting at any time that would be required at night in a hurry.

Children's nursery hours should be as follows :â€”All out of bed at seven, all Jressed and sitting down to breakfast at eight, nine o'clock should see the little troop out of doors in garden, in park, or on country roads.

A hip-bath should be used for the morning bath, and the ihild rapidly sluiced all over, and then enveloped in a large well-aired sheet of ine huckaback, not less than two yards square ; rub quickly but not roughly, ind see that the little limbs glow before you part with them. Then quTckly Iress the child in woll-aired clothes, and brush the hair, clean the teeth, and hear he morning prayer before setting him to table. 143.

93 Definition of Cookery. process of rendering food attrac- tive and nutritious by heat. Various methods used. First, in order to illustrate what I mean by prin- ciples, I will define cookery as almost Cookeryj a invariably implying a process of render- ing various foods, whether animal or vegetable, which cannot be agreeably or safely eaten in their natural state, attrac- tive, digestible, and nutritious, by the application of heat through different means or media, and at greatly differing degrees of temperature. I shall briefly consider, first, the process of cooking food through the medium of water, employed at a temperature of 212° Fahr., as (a) boiling; by the steam only of boiling water, as (b) steaming; afterwards as (c) stewing and braising, in which lower temperatures than boiling are adopted, while the process is con- tinued for a much longer period. Secondly, will follow the process of cooking food in dry heated air, as in (a) baking; or by radiation of heat from a clear fire, as in ($) roasting ; or on a grill above it, commonly known as (c) broiling. Lastly, the process of cooking by immersion in oil at a much higher temperature than can be obtained by any boiling in water, which is “ frying.” First, the cooking of meat by means of boiling water, although this is really effected in By means the interior of the portion or joint con- ^a*|^!ed siderably under the boiling temperature, “boiling.” Water “boils” when heated to 2120 Fahr. at the sea- level ; but to attain the best results from cookery,

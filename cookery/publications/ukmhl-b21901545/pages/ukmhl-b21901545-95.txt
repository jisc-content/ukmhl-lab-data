Food to be Agreeable also. 89 easily digestible as possible, and agreeable to the senses of taste, smell, and sight. The hard labourer with simple diet, provided his aliment is complete and fairly well cooked, will suffer little from indigestion. There may be a sameness in the small range of foods within his reach ; but he eats with appetite and zest, for, after all, “ hunger is the best sauce.” He cannot be guilty, for want of means, of eating too much, fertile source of deranged stomach with those who have an unlimited supply ; physical labour being also in many circum- stances the best preventive of dyspepsia. “ Live on sixpence a day and earn it,” attributed to Abernethy as the sum of his dietary for a gluttonous eater, is a maxim of value, endorsed by millions. But for the numerous sedentary workers in shops, offices, in business and professions of all kinds, the dish must not only be “complete;” it must be so prepared as to be easily digestible by stomachs of moderate power, and it should also be as appetizing and agree- able as circumstances admit.

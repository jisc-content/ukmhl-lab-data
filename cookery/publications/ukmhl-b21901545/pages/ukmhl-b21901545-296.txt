The Authorâ€™s Directions for Making Good Beef-tea. Chop fine or mince with a machine, a pound and a half of gravy beef from which the fat has been removed. Place it in an earthen jar with a lid, add a pint of cold water, and let it remain an hour, occasionally stirring and pressing the meat firmly with an iron spoon. Then place the jar, with the lid on, in a saucepan large enough to cover it, with water sufficient to reach nearly to the lid, but not near enough when gently boiling to rise above it and enter the jar. The water in the saucepan is to be kept at about boiling point or a little under, at the corner of the fire, for three hours, adding a little water occasionally, to replace that which evaporates. When the time has expired the jar may be removed, the beef-tea drained from the meat, which is then to be pressed as closely as possible through a coarse straining cloth so as to extract all the liquid. After standing a short time the beef-tea will become clear, much light brown flaky matter falling to the bottom. By no means remove this, as it is nutritious material, unless any special orders have been given to the contrary.

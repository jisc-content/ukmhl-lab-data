Comparison of Methods. 133 or partridge is the reverse of a compliment equally to the game, if mature, and to the guest, if a con- noisseur. A young and tender English partridge is not improved, I venture to submit, even by larding, although the reverse is true of quail. The French chef treats the white meat, veal and domestic poultry, with so many ingeniously contrived sauces, as to render those two meats as good as six. So successful is the achievement, that he is too often tempted to extend his art to dark-fleshed game, and seeking to adorn it with new flavours, destroys the original savour and aroma, in which consists for us the value of the dish. During the last few years, however, I have been happy to observe signs of a change in French the practice of the best French cooks appreciation, in this respect, as well as sometimes to find meats of better and more mature kind in Paris than formerly. One of the best illustrations of the value of the principle I have above referred to as that of old English cookery, I met with a few years ago, served to myself and a friend, in an excellent and well-known restaurant very near the Place de l’Op£ra. It was brought to me as a novelty, and A happy the method of realizing the idea I con- illustration, cede to be so, and in its way perfect in execution. It consisted of a very fine wild duck, simply but lightly and delicately roasted, and served without an atom of sauce.

Ordinary Braising. Jules Gouffe’s instructions for Boeuf d la mode, referred to at p. 107— “Take about 4 lbs. of thick beef-steak cut square. Lard the meat and place it in a stewpan with rather less than a pint of white wine, a pint of stock, a pint of cold water, two calves’ feet already boned and blanched, and two or three slices of bacon. Put it on the fire, adding about half an ounce of salt. Make it boil, and skim it as for a pot- au-feu; next, having skimmed it, add fully 1 lb. of carrots, one onion, three cloves, one faggot of herbs, and two pinches of pepper. Place the stewpan on the corner of the stove, cover it, and allow it to simmer very gently for four or five hours at least. Try the meat with a skewer to ascer- tain when it is sufficiently cooked; then put it on a dish with the carrots and the calves’ feet, and keep them covered up hot until serving. Next, strain the gravy through a fine tammy ; remove carefully every atom of grease, and reduce it over the fire about a quarter. Lastly, place the beef on the dish for serving; add the calves’ feet, each having been cut in eight pieces, the carrots cut into pieces the size of a cork, and ten glazed onions. Arrange the calves’ feet, carrots, and onions round the beef, pour the sauce over the meat, keeping the surplus for the next day. Taste it, in order to ascer- tain if sufficiently seasoned.”

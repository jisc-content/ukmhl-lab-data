Adhieing, a Valuable Process. 169 Mincing : rendering it more easily digested, which may be briefly described here. I refer to the use of a good mincing machine for the purpose of producing very fine divisions of the muscular fibres. I do not so much refer to its employment for serving afresh the useful for remains of food which have been already ordinary . , . . r r i purposes, cooked, as for its preparation of fresh meat with a special object in view. For the former, in order to produce mince-meat, or g _ also for a material for rissoles, etc., the process is, special of course, extremely useful. I refer product ’ rather to the value of this treatment of fresh meat, where sufficient mastication is difficult, owing to imperfect teeth or tender gums, or where f0r fresh habitual mastication is neglected, or 'are^ when time cannot really be bestowed imperfect, on it. The human stomach being adapted almost solely for the digestion of flesh, and not at all for that of vegetable and farinaceous matters, which are chiefly digested in the first intestine beyond the stomach, it is of the highest importance that animal fibre, whether of butcher’s meat, game, or poultry, should be minutely divided by a prolonged me- chanical action of the teeth before it is subjected to the chemical process, that is, digestion by the gastric juice which takes place in the stomach. Accordingly, if we are able to introduce into that organ, say, the flesh of rump-steak or mutton chop (which especially when fresh, as in hot weather, is by no means tender),

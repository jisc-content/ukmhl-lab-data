Place the mixture in a saucer-shaped pan which bears the fire, over which it is to be gently cooked, stirring well until the whole is dissolved, and the mixture is homo- geneous ; serve it in the pan, and eat it with a good supply of bread, and with salt and mustard to taste.

It appears to facilitate solution of the casein, and at all events cannot be an unwholesome addition. Indeed, as he observes, it supplies potash salts, which are naturally present in meat, but which are wanting in cheese. By adding bread crumbs, or slices of bread, and more milk, an excellent savoury pudding may be made, and baked in a pie-dish, or in a shallower one if pre- ferred. This preparation may be easily rendered an elegant one for other tables if required. Mattieu Williams’ suggestion.

n8 Food and Feeding. Question of economy considered. Much is often said of the economy effected by all these methods of slow cookery, on the ground of the smaller loss in weight produced by them, as compared with roasted meats. This is much less than would appear at first sight to be the case. It is quite true that a joint weighing fourteen pounds when roasted or baked may weigh only eleven, and if cooked in the low-temperature chamber may be finished at twelve pounds and a half. The difference in weight is due to loss of water only ; the far-reaching cooking odours amount to nothing. These are produced by slight scorching of the surface, one result of which is a highly appreciated and appetizing flavour in a very thin superficial layer, giving character to roasted and broiled meats, which cannot be obtained by any slow or closed-chamber process. Mr. Atkinson cleverly imitates the appearance of a roast in colour and dry- ness of surface by slightly buttering the outside of the joint to be “roasted,” and covering it with fine crumbs, or better still, the raspings of a French roll, which will give a browner and a crisper covering. But a true roast which “ tastes of the fire ” can only be really produced in front of a well-prepared open range. The principle on which all of them act is to prevent the escape of heat by constructing the oven of materials which are thoroughly non-conducting, and therefore do not consist of metal, invariably em- ployed for kitchen ranges. Metal conducts heat away

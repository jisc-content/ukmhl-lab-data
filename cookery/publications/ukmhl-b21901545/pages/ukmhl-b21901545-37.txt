Man naturally Omnivorous. 31 in relative proportions varying according to tempera- ture and activity of life. This conclusion is not to be determined by inferences drawn from the nature of his teeth, which may perhaps offer some indications, but by no means any decisive evidence respecting the question, although the character of his stomach and intestinal canal prove the accuracy of the state- Anatomical ments here made. In any case, evidence, anatomical evidence only indicates the results of a long course of development in the organs of a given animal, adapting it to the circumstances by which it has been surrounded, with the accommoda- tions of structure which have enabled it to survive in its struggle for existence, to occupy a prominent place in the fauna of its country.

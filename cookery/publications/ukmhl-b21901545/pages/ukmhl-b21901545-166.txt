Doubtless, if ripe and fresh, it is excellent when eaten raw ; but to have it at its very best, the tomato should be dipped, for thirty seconds at most, into boiling water. On re- moving it, the skin, which could previously be de- tached only with difficulty, peels off with the greatest ease. The juicy, fruity qualities are revealed by this process ; and it may be eaten alone or with any meat; and for a salad it should invariably be thus prepared. If served hot, only plain boiling, baking, or broiling will cook this delicious half-fruit, half- vegetable, so as least to alter or diminish its natural flavour ; although its deterioration has already com- Avoid over- menced, since each of these processes cooking. develops a degree of acidity which before cooking did not exist, and is neither agreeable nor quite wholesome.

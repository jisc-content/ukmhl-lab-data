Food and Feeding. 98 provided that the time of exposure to the lower degree of heat is considerably prolonged. There is a generally accepted table, current in all cookery books, indicating the time which every joint requires, grounded on its weight; but this always presupposes the boiling point of water, of course to commence with, and almost boiling sustained by continual com- bustion of fuel afterwards. The flavour of animal food is, by the system of prolonged low temperature referred to, better, and the meat itself more tender and more digestible ; a result which will inevitably bring into favour the practice of slow cooking when the best methods of conducting it have been adopted. That flesh so treated is easily digested is due to the Why cook- ^act a*" temPerature of I7°° to ingatlow i8o° the albumen contained therein is hmakes flesh sufficiently cooked but not overheated digestible. anci iiarcjenecp Any temperature higher than the above-named tends to solidify it, and when exposed to too much heat, as often happens to a fried or over-broiled steak, it then becomes diminished in thickness and curved instead of being plump and tender, while the shrunken and indurated fibres of the over-cooked portion are difficult of digestion by an average stomach. An excellent mode of securing the desired object in boiling is to move the pot containing the portion of meat, as soon as the initial boiling of six or seven minutes is completed, to a small gas ring or

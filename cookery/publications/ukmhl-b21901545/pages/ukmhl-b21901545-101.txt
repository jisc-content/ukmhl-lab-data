Hence, if we desire to realize the first- named object, for stock soup or beef-tea, some meat, previously cut fine, is macerated for two I# por or three hours in cool or tepid water, beef-tea; after which the temperature is very slowly raised to about 150°, and maintained there for some time. At the end of the process, not only much soluble nutritive matter referred to as albumen, but other valuable constituents, “extractives,” and salts, will be found dissolved in the liquid also. See the process for making beef-tea, which will be found in the Appendix. If, on the contrary, we desire to retain within the portion, say a leg of mutton, all its 2.

The object of this is to solidify or coagu- late, as it is usually termed, a thin layer of albumen on the entire surface of the joint.

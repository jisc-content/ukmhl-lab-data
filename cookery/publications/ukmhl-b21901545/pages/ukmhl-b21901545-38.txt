For it is a significant and important physiological fact, that the digestive apparatus of an animal must correspond to the extent of change which its food has to undergo in order to convert it into the flesh which constitutes the animal consuming it. Thus if grass, which is very low in the scale of vegetable growths, has to be converted into the highly composite animal fibre constituting beef and mutton, a long and complicated apparatus is required. It consists of four stomachs, from the first of which after eating, the food is returned into the mouth during the act of “ chewing the cud,” after which it is transmitted in turn through the other three, a process which confers the characteristic distinction of “ruminant” upon the animals referred to. No human stomach under any circumstances has the power of effecting the changes in question.

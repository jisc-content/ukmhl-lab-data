To return after this I hope permissible digres- sion ; a joint of meat may, however, be well cooked in the oven of an ordinary kitchener or complete cooking range, as now usually made, so as closely to resemble the result obtained by true roasting. The conditions are a good supply of heat, as An attempt far as possible from the top and both to roast in . , . , , , the oven, sides of the oven, the ability to ventilate when desired, a pan to catch the dripping beneath the grating on which the joint rests, that pan resting on another an inch or two deeper, containing water below, the evaporation of which maintains the dripping at a moderate temperature, rendering impossible its decomposition or burning with its all-pervading offensive odour. In this way the nearest approach has been made to accomplish in an oven the results achieved by roasting; and for joints of meat it is almost successful. It is not possible thus to acquire the effect which constant basting of the roast attains, and for game certainly the latter process should be employed. Those who desire to pursue Mattieu this subject further are strongly advised Williamsâ€™ to make themselves acquainted with a work, already referred to, by Mr. M. Williams. It deals with the subject very fully, while its lucid and interesting style renders it very attractive ; moreover, it abounds in quaint and suggestive hints, and is valuable, particularly to those who desire to avoid

To the juice of eight fine sweet oranges and four Seville, well strained, add an ounce and a half of isinglass dissolved in boiling water; sweeten with four grains of saccha- rin, and stir it gently over the fire, but do not let it boil. Pour the jelly into moulds when nearly cold, the moulds having been previously filled with cold water. Currant and Raspberry Jelly. 345. Bruise in a jar two pounds of red and one pound of white currants with a pint of red raspberries; place the jar in boiling water to extract the juice.

Allow both the fruit-juice, when strained, and the sweetened isinglass to cool; then mix equal quantities, pour into shapes, and place the jelly in ice. Rum Jelly. 346. Dissolve twelve grains of saccharin in a pint of boiling water; mix with this two ounces of clarified isinglass or gela- tine, and add the juice of a lemon and a wineglassful of fine old Jamaica rum.

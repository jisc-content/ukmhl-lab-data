Put iuto a stew-pan a little butter with an onion chopped fine; add a little gravy and one tablespoonful of strong ale; season with pepper and salt, and stir these in- gredients over the fire until the onion is a rich brown. Cut, but do not chop, some cold beef very fine, add it to the gravy,' stir till quite hot and serve; garnish with sippets of well- toasted bread. Be careful in not allowing the gravy to boil after the meat is added, as it would render it hard and tough. To Koast Venison. 280. Take great care the meat is well-hung. Take the skin from the top part, put butter and salt over the fat then make a paste of flour and water, lay it on, and fasten it by lour or five sheets of paper, sewn together and skewered on brmly. Koast it gently and baste it. About half an hour before it is done take off the paper and paste, and let it colour gradually to a pale brown, but be most careful it does not burn.

Cut off the stalk, remove the faded and outer leaves, and halve, or, if large, quarter the cabbages. Wash them thoroughly and lay them for a few minutes in water, to which a tablespoonful of vinegar has been added, to draw out any insects that may be lodging under the leaves. Drain them in a colander. Have ready a large pan of boiling water, with a tablespoonful of salt and a small piece of soda in it, and let the cabbages boil quickly till tender, leaving the saucepan un- covered. Take them up as soon as they are done, drain them thoroughly and serve. Time to boil young summer cabbages, from ten to fifteen minutes; large cabbages, half an hour or more. Savoy Cabbage. 288.

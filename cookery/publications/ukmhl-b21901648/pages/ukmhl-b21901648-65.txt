164.] BREAKFAST DISHES. 61 Put the mushrooms when tender on a dish, break some eggs upon them to cover the surface, and in doing this be careful not to break the yolks of the eggs. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle browned crumbs on the top, and put the dish in a hot oven till the eggs are set. Serve immediately. Time to stew mushrooms, from ten to fifteen minutes. Dried Haddock. 162. Boil it in a frying-pan, with just enough water to cover it; put it on a drainer to drain, then put it before the fire with a large piece of butter on it. Herrings, Pickled. 163. Take half a pound of salt, half a pound of bay-salt, one grain of saccharin, and an ounce of saltpetre. Pound all well together until reduced to a fine powder. Procure the herrings as fresh as possible, cut off the heads and tails, open them, and lay them for one hour in brine strong enough to float an egg. Drain, dry the fish with a soft cloth, and put them in layers into a deep jar, with a little of the powder between each layer, and a little both at the top and bottom of the jar. When the jar is full press it down and cover it closely. The fish will be ready in three months. Kidney Omelette. 164. Take two sheep's kidneys and cut into slices; fry them over a clear fire for three or four minutes in a little butter j mince them finely, season with pepper and salt, beat up the yolks of three eggs and the white of one, add the minced kidney to them. Put an ounce of butter in an omelette-pan, let it remain on a slow fire until it bubbles, then pour in the mixture, and stir briskly for a minute or two until the eggs are set. Fold the edges of the omelette over neatly, and turn it carefully upon a hot dish. Serve immediately. If too much cooled it will be tough.

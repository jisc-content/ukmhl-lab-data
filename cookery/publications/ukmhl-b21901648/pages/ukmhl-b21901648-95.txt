2S6.] DINNER DISHES. 9' hold of this by the four corners and shake the leaves until they are dry ; put them on a dish, sprinkle a little salt over them, lay the pigeons upon them, and pour brown gravy over. The cresses are sometimes arranged round the dish instead of being placed under the birds. Time, about twenty minutes to roast the pigeons. Mutton, Neck of, Boiled. 255. Shorten the ribs and saw off the chine-bone of a neck of mutton, or from three or four pounds of the best end ; to look well it should not exceed five inches in length. Pare off the fat that is in excess of what may be eaten, and boil slowly in plenty of water, slightly salted; skim carefully and remove the fat from the surface. The meat may be served plainly with caper or parsley sauce, and a garnish of boiled turnips and carrots cut into thin strips placed alternately round the dish. Four middle-sized turnips or three carrots may be boiled with the mutton. Time, a full quarter of an hour to the pound. Mutton, Kebobbed. 256. This favourite Oriental dish can be prepared with our English mutton in a manner far superior to any kebob at Turkish or Egyptian tables. Take a loin of mutton, joint it well at every bone, cut off all superfluous fat, particularly of the kidney, and remove the skin. Prepare a well-proportioned and large seasoning of the following ingredients : Some breadcrumbs, sweet herbs, nutmegs, pepper and salt. Brush the mutton chops over with yolk of egg, and sprinkle the above mixture thickly over them; then tie the chops together in their original order, run a slender spit through them, and roast before a quick fire, basting them well with butter and the drippings from the meat, and throwing more of the season- ing on them from time to time. Serve with the gravy from the meat.

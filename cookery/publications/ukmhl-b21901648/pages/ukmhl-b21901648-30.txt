2b FOODS FOR THE FAT. [61- body. The Esquimaux eat fat as we do bread. Dr. Pavy, in his work on ' Dietetics,' says : ' Travellers have dilated on the large amount of food consumed by the inhabitants of cold, as compared with that consumed by those of temperate or hot climates. Accounts are given which almost appear incredible regarding the enormous quantities of food devoured by dwellers in the Arctic regions. Thus Sir John Boss states that an Esquimaux "perhaps eats twenty pounds of flesh and oil daily." Sir W. Parry, as a matter of curiosity, one day tried how much food an Esquimaux lad, scarcely full-grown, would consume if allowed his full tether. The food was weighed, and, besides fluids, he got through in twenty-four hours 8Â£ lb. of flesh and If lb. of bread, and " did not consider the quantity extraordinary."' 61.

By the end of an hour they had got through a half of their allowance in Sir George Simpson's presence. Their stomachs at this time projected ' into a brace of kettledrums.' They were then left in charge of deputies, and Sir George was assured, on returning two hours later, that all had been con- sumed. He remarks that after such surfeits, the gluttons remain for three or four days in a state of stupor, neither eating nor drinking, and meanwhile are rolled about with a view to the promotion of digestion. 63. ' He who is well fed,' remarks Sir John Eoss, 'resists cold better than the man who is stinted, while the starvation from cold follows but too soon a starvation in food.' He says further, ' All experience has shown that a large use of

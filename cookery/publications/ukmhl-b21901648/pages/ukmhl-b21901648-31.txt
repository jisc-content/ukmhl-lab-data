67.] EVILS OF OVER-EATING, AND TIME 'FOR MEALS. 27 oil and fat meats is the true secret of life in these frozen countries.' Sir John Franklin also states : ' During the whole of our march we experienced that no quantity of clothing could keep us warm while we fasted; but on those occasions on which we were enabled to go to bed with full stomachs, we passed the night in a warm and comfortable manner.' 64.

EVILS OF OVER-EATING, AND TIME FOE MEALS. 65. There is far more harm done by taking too much food than there is by taking too little, and it is only in very ex- ceptional cases that injury results from the latter cause; whereas an enormous amount of discomfort, disorder, and disease, and even curtailment of life, arise from excess in eating and drinking. Where the individual lives plainly and simply, and only obeys the cravings of nature to the extent of satisfying them, there is no need for weights and scales ; but how many are there not, who would be far more comfortable and more healthy if they lived upon a measured amount of food and drink ? 66. There are many other evils beyond corpulence that result from excess in eating, and a badly arranged dietary. Among them may be mentioned a deranged digestion, a loaded tongue, an oppressed stomach, vitiated secretions, a gorged liver, plethora and its consequences, a sluggish brain, with horrible dreams"during sleep, and depression when awake. 67.

Whereas excess of vegetable food of certain kinds leads to obesity, excess of animal food, if not accompanied by exercise, leads to the accumulation in the system of the materials that form gout.

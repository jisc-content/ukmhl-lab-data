I4-] CORPULENCY. >3 13. The following, then,' are the objects aimed at in the rules inculcated and the diet laid down in the following pages : 1. To improve by exercise the muscular tissue, and by diet to keep the muscles of the body in firm fibre and tone. 2. To maintain the blood in its normal and healthy com- position. 3. To regulate the quantity of fluid in the body, by freeing the action of the skin and kidneys. 4. To prevent the deposit of fat, by eliminating from the diet an excess of those articles which create it, but are not otherwise useful in the economy. 5. To allow quite sufficient food, and even many luxuries, so as to satisfy the cravings of nature and the wants of the system, and to do this in a gradual, harmless manner, f FOOD REQUIRED, AMOUNT OF. 14. ' It may fairly be concluded,' says Dr. Pavy,{ ' that the requirements as regards food vary with exposure to different conditions. According to the expenditure that is taking place, so in a good scheme of dieting should materials be supplied which are best calculated to yield what is wanted. Under exposure to hard labour and inactivity, and to a high and low temperature, the consumption of material in the system differs, and the supply of food should be regulated accordingly.' * Luigi Cornaro, a Venetian gentleman of the seventeenth century, after a wild youth which destroyed his health, restored himself after the age of forty to perfect health by a most rigid diet. He had each day a careful allowance of 12 oz. of food—bread, meat, and yolk of egg—and 14 oz. of light Italian wine. He wrote his book at eighty-three, and lived on his hermit-fare until nearly a hundred years old, and enjoyed excellent health. His wife, who we may presume fared in the same manner, lived nearly as long. t A friend of the author's proposes fitting up a sanatorium for treating sufferers from corpulency, dieting in the manner recommended in this work. t ' Pood and Dietetics,' by F.

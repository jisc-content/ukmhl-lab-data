28 FOOD'S FOR THE FAT. [6g. 68. As man is designed by nature to consume a mixed diet, we may proceed to consider when and at what intervals food should be taken. The ordinary custom is that three meals should be taken daily, at intervals of five or six hours apart, and this has been found by experience to be best suited to our requirements. This allows a short period of quiescence for the stomach. The size of the meal should be regulated ac- cording to the estimate given on page 17, always having regard to the fact that increased muscular work will allow for increased diet. 69. Sex also and age influence the amount of food required. A woman on the average takes a tenth part less than a man ; and during growth more food is necessary to minister to the bodily functions, which are then more active, as well as to supply materials for increase. After forty, the diet, if long life is to be enjoyed, should be sparing. AMOUNT OF FOOD TO BE CONSUMED.! 70. To prevent the accumulation of fat in those of this pre- disposition, the following system of diet should be pursued : 71. Breakfast.—One large cup of tea or coffee, with a little milk and one or two saccharine tabloids,* with 2 or 3 oz. of bread or dry toast, very thinly buttered, or, instead of butter, 3 or 4 oz. of any light meat or fish, contained in breakfast dishes. 72. Lunch or Dinner.—An ordinary dish of any soup found in the section devoted to that aliment; 7 or 8 oz. of roast or boiled meat, fish, or any meat dish that may be chosen in the following pages ; an ordinary amount of any vegetable given under that head; a small plate of any non-farinaceous pudding, which see; and 5 or 6 oz. of any fruit, if cooked, * These may be procured from Messrs. Burroughes, Welcome, and Co., Snow Hill Buildings, London, or through any chemist, at a cost of about a shilling a hundred, and should be used with all things that retjuire sweeten- ing. t See page 46.

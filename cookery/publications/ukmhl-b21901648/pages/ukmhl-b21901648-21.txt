FOOD REQUIRED, AMOUNT OF. 29-] 17 desire to gratify the palate. When food is not eaten too quickly and the diet is simple, a timely warning is afforded by the sense of satisfaction experienced as soon as enough has been taken, and not only does a disinclination arise, but the stomach even refuses it if this amount be far exceeded. With a variety of food, however, and especially food of an agreeable character to the taste, the case is different. Satiated with one article, the stomach is still ready for another, and thus, for the gratification of taste, and not to satisfy appetite, men are tempted to consume far more than is required, and also, it must be said, far more than is advantageous to health.' 27. Hospital diet furnishes a fair estimate of what is neces- sary under ordinary circumstances, and, taking Guy's as an example, it is found that the daily allowance is 29 J oz. of solid food, apart from the liquids supplied. This amount would represent 16| oz. of water-free material.

In this case the above amount of food would be divided 2

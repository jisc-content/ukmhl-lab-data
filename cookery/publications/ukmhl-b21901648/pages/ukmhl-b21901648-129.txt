It must be stirred one way all the time, and when done poured into a glass, and served with a thin slice of toasted bread cut into long slices and placed on a plate crossed over each other. A little grated nutmeg may be added if the flavour is liked. Lemonade. 372. Grate the peel of six lemons; pour a quart of boiling water on it.

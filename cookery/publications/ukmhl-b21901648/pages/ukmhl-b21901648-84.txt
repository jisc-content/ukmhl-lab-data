&Â° FOODS FOR THE FAT. [222. Oysters, Baked. 222. Mix three tablespoonfuls of finely-grated breadcrumbs with half a saltspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of white pepper, and a quarter of a nutmeg grated. Open a dozen oysters, dip them in beaten egg, roll them in the seasoned crumbs, put each one in its lower shell, and lay a small piece of butter upon it. Place the oysters in the oven or before the fire for a few minutes, until they are quite hot. Before serving squeeze a little lemon-juice upon them. Oyster Fritters. 223. Open a dozen oysters, and warm them in their own liquor for a minute ; put them aside. Beat two eggs, and mix with them half a tablespoonful of milk. Add a little salt, a quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper, a quarter of a nutmeg grated, a quarter of a saltspoonful of pounded mace, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of grated lemon-rind. Dip the oysters into this batter, and then into finely-grated breadcrumbs. Fry in hot fat until they are brown and crisp. They may be used for garnishing. Cod, Crimped. 224. Make some deep cuts as far as the bones on both sides of a perfectly fresh cod, making the cuts at two inches distance, and cut one or two gashes on the cheeks ; then lay the fish in cold water, with a tablespoonful of vinegar in it, for an hour or two. It may afterwards be boiled or fried. If it is to be boiled, it should be plunged at once into boiling water, and then simmered gently. Crimping renders the flesh firmer, and makes it better both to cook and to serve.

SOUPS. 67 Game Soup. 180. Take any game too old for roasting—a couple of partridges or three moor-fowl; stew them well and slowly in about three pints of stock. When tender, take them out, cut off some of the best pieces, return the rest to the soup ; add pepper, salt, and a little ketchup. Let this simmer gently while you prepare the pieces you have cut off. Take these pieces, trim them neatly, season well, shake a little flour over and fry a nice brown, but don't let them be greasy. Strain the soup through a sieve, rubbing as much of the meat through from the game as you can ; return the soup to the pan, put in the fried pieces of game; make it very hot, and serve. Green Pea Soup. 181. Take a quart of green peas, a stick of celery, an onion and turnip, all cut, some mint, and about a quart of stock. Stew till tender, then pass through a fine sieve. If too thick, add some more stock; add salt, pepper, and a little saccharin; have ready about a pint of young green peas, parboiled in water with a little mint, add them to the soup, and let the whole simmer until tender, then serve. Oyster Soup. 182. Allow about three dozen to a quart of soup. Open them carefully, keep and strain the liquor from them, beard the oysters, and put the strained liquor over them. Take a quart of the palest veal stock and simmer the beards in it for twenty minutes ; strain, adding a little more stock if required. Put the oysters over the fire in their own liquor to plump them, but do not let them boil. Put the soup over the fire, add mace and cayenne, pour the liquor from the oysters to it' put the oysters into the tureen, and pour the soup over them and serve. 5—2

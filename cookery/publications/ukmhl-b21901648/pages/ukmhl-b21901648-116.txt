FOODS FOR THE FAT. 112 Artichokes, Fried. 321. Pare some artichokes, and boil them in salt and water for about a quarter of an hour. Drain and cut them into slices about a quarter of an inch in thickness, dip them into the white of an egg well beaten, and afterwards strew finely-grated bread on them. Fry in boiling oil or lard till they are nicely browned, and serve piled high on a dish. Artichokes Stewed in Gravy. 322. Strip off the leaves from the artichokes, remove the chokes, and soak them in lukewarm water for three hours, changing the water three or four times. Place them in a saucepan with enough gravy to cover them, a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, the juice of a lemon, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Let them stew gently until tender, then serve with the sauce poured over them, and as hot as possible. Artichokes, Mashed. 323. Wash and pare some artichokes ; boil them in salt and water until quite tender, then drain and press the water thoroughly from them. Put them into a saucepan, and beat to a pulp, adding salt, pepper, and a little cream. Serve very hot. Stewed Red Cabbage. 324.

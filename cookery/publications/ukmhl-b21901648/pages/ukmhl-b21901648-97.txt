They should be trussed in the same way, and may be stuffed or not (with hare stuffing), according to preference. A leveret is best when larded, but if this cannot be done, cover it either with thin slices of fat bacon or with a thickly buttered piece of white paper. Roast it before a brisk fire, and baste it con- stantly, and a few minutes before it is taken down remove the bacon or paper. Serve it very hot, and send red-currant jelly to table with it as well as the following gravy, a little of which may be put in the dish and the rest in a tureen : Thicken half a pint of stock with a small piece of butter rolled in flour, let it boil for ten minutes, then stir a wineglassful of port into it, boil up once more, and serve. Time, an hour to roast the leveret. Meat Pie a la Don Pedro. 261. This is a kind of ragout put into a tin made expressly for the dish.

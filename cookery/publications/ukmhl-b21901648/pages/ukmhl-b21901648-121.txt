FRUITS, JELLIES, AND CREAMS. 117 339-] Easpberry Cream without Cream. 337. Mix with a quarter of a pound of raspberries three grains of saccharin or six tabloids, and the whites of four eggs. All to be beaten together for one hour, and then put in lumps in a glass dish. Calf's-foot Jelly. 338. Cut two calves' feet in small pieces after they have been well cleaned and the hair taken off. Stew them very gently in two quarts of water till it is reduced to one quart. When cold, take off the fat and remove the jelly from the sedi- ment. Put it into a saucepan with six grains of saccharin or twelve tabloids, a pint of white wine, a wineglass of brandy in it, the peel of four lemons finely chopped, the whites of four eggs well-beaten, and their shells broken. Put the saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm. Let it boil a quarter of an hour after it rises to a head ; then cover it close, and let it stand about half an hour; after which, pour it through a jelly-bag, first dipping the bag in hot water to prevent waste, and squeezing it quite dry. Pour the jelly through and through until clear, then put it into a mould. Gooseberry Fool. 339. Put two quarts of gooseberries into a stewpan with a quart of water; when they begin to turn yellow and swell, drain the water from them and press them with the back of a spoon through a colander; sweeten them with saccharin to your taste, and set them to cool. Put two quarts of milk over the fire, beaten up with the yolks of four eggs and a little grated nutmeg; stir it over the fire and then gradually into the cold gooseberries; let it stand until cold, and serve it. The eggs may be left out, and milk only may be used. Half this quantity makes a good dishful.

Cut them into pieces about six inches long, remove the prickles, and blanch them in boiling water for a quarter of an hour. Scrape off the skin, and tie them in bundles. Cover them with nicely-flavoured stock, and boil till tender. Turnips, Boiled. 297. Turnips should only be served whole when they are very young. When they have reached any size they should be mashed. Pare the turnips and wash them; if very young a little of the green top may be left on; if very large they should be divided into halves, or even quarters. Throw them into slightly salted water, and let them boil gently till tender. Drain and serve them. Time to boil old turnips, three- quarters of an hour to an hour and a half; young turnips, fifteen to twenty-five minutes. Artichokes, Boiled. 298. Gather the artichokes two or three days before they are required for use. Cut off the stems, pull out the strings, and wash them in two or three waters, that no insects may be in them. Have a large saucepan of boiling water, with two tablespoonfuls of salt and a piece of soda the size of a sixpence to every gallon of water, put the artichokes in with the tops downwards, and let them boil quickly until tender. About half an hour or three - quarters will boil them, but that can be ascertained by pulling out one of the leaves (if it comes out easily they are done), or by trying them with a fork. Take them out and lay them upside down to drain. Serve them on a napkin.

SACCHARIN. US SACCHARIN. The invention of the above substitute for sugar is a boon to those who suffer from corpulency or skin disease, as the use of sugar in both cases is injurious, and this article, for which we are indebted to Dr. Fahlberg, is a perfect substitute. Experiments have been made of the most exhaustive nature, that prove it to be perfectly harmless, and Dr. Pavy and others give the following as the result of their investigation : (1) That saccharin is quite innocuous when taken in ordinary dietary. (2) Saccharin does not interfere with or impede the diges- tive processes when taken in any ordinary quantity. The Lancet says its continued use is quite harmless. This being so, sugar—one of the great dietetic articles so constantly used in food, and the greatest of all fattening sub- stances—may be completely cast aside, as saccharin is a perfect substitute, and quite as convenient to use. It is sold in a soluble powder and in the form of a tabloid, containing half a grain, this being equal to about half an ounce of sugar. For stewed fruits, jellies, and all culinary purposes it will be found that two tabloids are equal to quite one ounce of sugar. They are soluble in hot or cold water. One tabloid, or half a grain of the powder, is sufficient for a large cup of tea or coffee. The tabloids are sold at about one shilling a hundred. The best-known makers are Burroughs, Wellcome and Co., Snow Hill Buildings, London, and they may be had of all grocers and chemists. The recipes for jellies, beverages, etc., given in this book have been tried by the author, and he can speak of them as in every way equal to those containing sugar. If it is desirable to make a firm jelly, a little more isinglass or gelatine should be used than is given in the recipe. Sugar, as is well known, is the most fattening article in the daily dietary, and with some people the most bilious, so that it is equally a boon to those who are troubled with an inactive liver.

30 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 50. Cauliflower with Parmesan Cheese. Ingredients. A small Cauliflower. Two ounces of grated Parmesan Cheese. A quarter of a pint of Plain White Sauce. Trim all the green from the cauliflower, wash it well, and cut the stalk so that it will stand firmly on a baking-dish. Place it in a little vinegar and water for a quarter of an hour, to draw out the insects, then put it into boiling water with a little salt. It will take about twenty minutes to boil. Try the stalk to see whether it is tender ; it must not be broken. Drain it very carefully and place it in a baking-dish. A French fireproof dish is the best, as the cauliflower can be sent to table in it. Make a quarter of a pint of sauce from recipe for " Plain White Sauce." Pour this carefully over the cauliflower, then sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the sauce and brown in a hot oven. Serve immediately. 51. Cauliflower a la Maitre d'Hotel. Ingredients.

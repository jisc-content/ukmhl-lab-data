81 VEGETABLES 154. Carrots (Stewed). Ingredients. Two pounds of Carrots. | Half a pint of Brown Gravy. Half a teaspoonful of mixed Mustard. The carrots should be scraped and washed before weighing. Cut them lengthwise into quarters, if large, and again into pieces two inches long. Throw them into cold water, and let them boil up quickly; if the carrots are old, throw away the water after the first fifteen minutes and put them into fresh hot water. This is unnecessary when the carrots are young; it is also better not to cut the carrots when they are quite small, as they look best served whole. Boil them until quite tender, which will be in from half an hour to an hour, or longer, according to age. Drain them well and put them into the gravy. (See " Brown Gravy/1) Let them stew very gently for twenty minutes. Mix the mustard with a little of the gravy, which should be cool, and add it to the rest. Serve very hot with fried or toasted bread. 155. Cauliflower Fritters. Ingredients. One Cauliflower. | Batter for frying Savouries. Well clean, and partly boil, the cauliflower, and break into pieces; dip them in the batter, and fry in boiling oil, or Albene. 6

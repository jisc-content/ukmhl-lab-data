141 SWEETS 285. Normandy Pippins (Stewed). Ingredients. Half a pound of Nor- mandy Pippins. Six ounces of Sugar. One quart of Water. Wash the pippins well and soak them over night in one quart of water. Remove the apples from the water with a spoon, so as to let all impurities sink to the bottom of the bowl. Now pour off the water that the pippins have been soaked in, and strain it over them, leaving the sediment. Add the sugar, and let them boil up quickly, when they must be well skimmed. Now put them where they will simmer very slowly until they are quite tender, but unbroken, and they have turned a rich brown. This will take between three and four hours. If Normandy pippins are cooked quickly they are quite spoiled. 286. Omnibus Pudding. Ingredients. Six ounces of Flour (or Kusk- crumbs). Four ounces of Albene. Six ounces of Sultanas. Four ounces of Golden Syrup. Half a pint of Milk. Mix the butter and flour together and add the sultanas. Warm the syrup and milk together, and add to the rest. Steam in a well-buttered basin for four hours. Serve with any white sauce.

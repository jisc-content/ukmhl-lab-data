Four ounces of Bread-crumbs. Two ounces of Butter. Half a pint of Milk. The grated rind and juice of a Lemon. The whites of three Eggs. Two tablespoonfuls of Sugar. Two tablespoonfuls of Flour. Blanch the almonds and put them through the nut- mill. Pound them well, adding a little water occasionally to prevent them oiling. Add them to the milk, and let them simmer on the stove for a quarter of an hour, then pour over the bread-crumbs, and add the butter, sugar, flour, and lemon rind and juice. Beat the whites of eggs to a stiff froth and mix them well into the other ingredients. Butter a mould and pour in the mixture and steam for four hours.

194 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 393. Pancakes. Ingredients. Half a pint of Milk. The whites of two Eggs. Two ounces of Flour. Butter, Mix the flour and milk smoothly together, adding a little milk at a time, until it is all used. Now put the batter aside, for at least two hours, or the pancakes will not be light. When it has stood, beat up the whites of eggs, rather stiff, and mix them well with the batter. A six-inch frying-pan makes the nicest pancakes, and for this size half a teacupful of batter will be required, and a piece of butter half the size of a walnut. Just let the butter get hot, and thoroughly grease the pan before putting in the batter. Turn with a broad-bladed knife as soon as brown, and brown on the other side. Roll when done, and sift powdered sugar over the pancakes. If whites of eggs are not handy, a teaspoonful of baking- powder instead makes excellent pancakes; but, of course, they are not so nourishing. 394. Buckwheat Pancakes. Ingredients.

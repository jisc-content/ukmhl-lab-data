SWEETS 143 too many at one time. When of a nice golden colour take them up and drain well on paper or a cloth. Dredge with icing sugar, and arrange them nicely on a dish covered with lace paper. Serve plain or with an orange-flavoured syrup. These are also nice to garnish a rice or vermicelli mould. 289. Orange Jelly. Ingredients. Fourteen Oranges. One ounce of Agar Agar. Six ounces of loaf Sugar. One or two Lemons. Strain the juice of the oranges and lemons through a fine sieve. Make a syrup of the sugar and pour it boiling hot on the thinly-pared rind of two oranges. Dissolve the agar agar, and add to the syrup, then mix the juice in and allow it to get cold. Although not stiff enough to set well in a mould, it is much nicer than if more gelatine were added. 290. Orange Meringue. Ingredients. Four ounces of Rice. Two ounces of Sugar. One quart of Milk. Any flavouring desired. Boil the rice in the milk for four hours until all the milk is absorbed. Pour into a basin and let it get cold, and turn out into a glass dish. Pour over a compot of oranges according to recipe No. 287, and put whipped cream on the top.

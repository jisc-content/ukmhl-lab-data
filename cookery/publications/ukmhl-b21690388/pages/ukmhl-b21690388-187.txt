SWEETS 14 302. Raspberry Jelly. Ingredients, One pint of Raspberry juice. | One pound of loaf Sugar. To draw the juice from the raspberries, put them in a jar and bruise them slightly, then place the jar in a pan of boiling water and keep it boiling gently until the juice flows freely. Lay a piece of muslin in a fine sieve and pour the juice into it until no more will flow; then turn the fruit into the sieve, and leave it to let the juice drain away from it; but it must not be pressed or the juice will be muddy. Measure the juice carefully and add the sugar, in lumps, in the quantity given. Let it boil gently and skim it carefully. When it has boiled for half an hour, pour a teaspoonful on a cold plate, and if it sets the jelly is done, if not, let it boil a little longer. Put it in small pots and cover, when cold, in the usual way. The flavour is much improved by one part of red-currant juice being used to two parts of raspberry, but the currants would make the jelly too acid for most people on this diet. 303.

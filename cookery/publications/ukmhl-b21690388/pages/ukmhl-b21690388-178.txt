140 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK then place the jar—which must be covered—in a sauce- pan of boiling water. Let the water boil until the j uice flows freely from the mulberries; then strain them through a fine hair sieve. Do not squeeze the mulberries, but let the juice drop slowly through. Crush the tapioca so that no lumps remain; then pour the mul- berry juice over it and let it stand all night. Boil it until it is quite clear, stirring to keep it from burning, and add sugar to taste. Pour into small moulds which have been standing in cold water. Serve with either cream or custard—made with Bird's Custard Powder. Windfalls do quite well for this dish, and those who possess mulberry trees will find that the fruit can be utilised to great advantage in this way. 284. Normandy Pudding. Ingredients. Six ounces Bread-crumbs. Six ounces castor Sugar. Six small sour cooking Apples. One Lemon. One saltspoonful ground Cloves. One teaspoonful of ground Cin- namon. Whites of six Eggs. Peel, slice, and core the apples or chop them up, not too finely ; put them with all the other dry ingredients in a basin, and stir well; add the whisked whites of eggs slowly. When thoroughly mixed add the lemon- juice and the finely-grated rind of half of it (also a little brandy or rum if liked), and pour the mixture into a well-greased mould, tie over a greased cloth or paper, and steam for about three hours. Serve with white-wine sauce. [Note.—The use of rum or brandy is optional. The pudding is much more tasty if one or the other is added.]

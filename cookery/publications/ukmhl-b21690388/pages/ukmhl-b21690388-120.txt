82 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 156. Cauliflower (Stewed). Ingredients. A medium-sized Cauliflower. | Half a pint of Brown Gravy. Divide the cauliflower into neat pieces and wash these well. It is well to put them into vinegar and water for a quarter of an hour, as this will be sure to draw out the insects. Put them into boiling water and boil until tender, which should be in fifteen or twenty minutes. If a little of the stalk is pressed between the finger and thumb it can be easily ascertained whether the cauli- flower is done. The pieces should remain firm though sufficiently cooked. Drain them carefully, and lay them in a stewpan with the gravy, and let them stand for ten minutes before serving. The gravy must be made according to the recipe for " Brown Gravy." 157. Celery (Boiled). Ingredients. A large head of Celery. | Half a pint of Plain White Sauce. Use only the best part of the celery, the remainder can be kept for flavouring soups. Cut the head into quarters and again into six-inch lengths; wash it well, and tie it into bundles. Put them into cold water, and let them boil up quickly at first, and then gently until the celery is tender. Drain them well, and remove the cotton they have been tied with, arrange the celery neatly in a vegetable dish, and pour the white sauce over them. See recipe for " Plain White Sauce."

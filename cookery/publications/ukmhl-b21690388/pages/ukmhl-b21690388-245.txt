207 SALADS 415. Cucumber Salad. In dressing a cucumber with oil and vinegar care should be taken not to use too much vinegar. The proportion of one part vinegar and three parts oil is best for digestion, and for people on this diet. French vinegar should always be used with oil, as malt vinegar in conjunction with oil produces a disagreeable bitter taste, for which the oil is often blamed. (See " Hints on Cooking.") 416. Endive Salad. Ingredients. One head of Endive. A dessertspoonful of Salad Oil. Half of a small Beetroot. Three dessertspoonfuls of French A small slice of Onion. Vinegar. Pepper. Wash the endive and tear it into convenient pieces for eating ; it must not be cut. Slice the beetroot very thin. Put a very thin slice of onion, about the size of a shilling, in the salad bowl, and mince it as fine as possible. Now add the endive,! which should be well dried by tossing it in a clean cloth. Dust in the pepper, mixing the salad at the same time, then add the oil and vinegar, and mix very thoroughly. Serve immediately.

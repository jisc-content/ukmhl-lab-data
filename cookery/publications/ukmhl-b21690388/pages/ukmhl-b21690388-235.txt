BREAD, PASTRY, CAKES, &c. 197 When all the butter has been used fold the paste into three, and once again lengthwise, and lay it in a deep dish and cover closely. Let it stand in a cool place for at least twelve hours. This paste will keep two or three days without baking, unless the weather is very hot. Be very careful in making up the paste into tartlets, tarts, &c, to keep it the way of the grain in rolling out, or as the flakes lie. The cuttings if placed flat, one on the top of the other, and rolled out, will then be just as light and flaky as when first rolled out. Some cooks spoil quite a quarter of the paste in the making of tartlets, &c, by not observing this rule ; for if the cuttings are gathered up carelessly in the hand, and made into a ball, and then rolled out, all the work of the cook is spoiled ; for paste treated so will be very little better than ordinary short-paste. This recipe has been used in the writer's family for over a hundred years, and if it is carefully followed the result is excellent. It may seem very troublesome to the novice, but after a very little practice it will be found that the paste is quickly and easily made, con- sidering the result. The only change the writer has made in the old recipe is to use a little baking-powder. The preceding recipe is fomided upon the old one, in the method of working the paste, but it is less rich ; it is, however, an excellent paste, and if instructions are carefully followed it will be found to be far above the average met with in middle-class households.

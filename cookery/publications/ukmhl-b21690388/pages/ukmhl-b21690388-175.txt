137 SWEETS 277. Milk Rice. Ingredients. Four ounces of Eice. Nutmeg. One quart of Milk. Sugar. Wash the rice and put it into a double pan. Boil the milk and pour it over the rice. Let it cook for two hours, and then sweeten with sugar and flavour with nutmeg to taste. Milk rice is very liable to burn, so that it is safer to use a double pan. It takes longer to cook in this way, but it is much more satisfactory. (See " Hints on Cooking.) 278. Milk Sago. Ingredients. Four ounces of Sago. Nutmeg. One quart of Milk. Sugar. Prepare this exactly as in preceding recipe, " Milk Rice." Any other flavouring can be substituted for the nutmeg. A strip of thin lemon peel simmered for the last half-hour in the milk makes an agreeable flavouring.

NUT DISHES. INTRODUCTION. These are the best and most natural food of man ; they are loved by children, who are always hungry for them, in marked contrast with their attitude towards meat, which they often have to be forced to eat. Yet once they have been forced to take it for a time, it may, like other stimulant poisons, set up a craving and, therefore, have to be continued. Like all natural foods nuts are best taken uncooked and in their natural state, and those who begin to eat them as children prefer them uncooked; but adults who have ruined their circulation, teeth, and digestion by years of stimulant poison taking, may be quite unable to do this. Hence the use of very tender nuts at first, and often more or less careful cooking, has become for them a necessity. Nuts are a comparatively concentrated food, being for the most part twice as nourishing as bread, and with one or two exceptions they are free from starch, which is the cause of so much dyspepsia in degenerate stimulant takers. They are a food which is already fairly cheap, but which, with the expenditure of a little care and forethought on production and storage, might easily be rendered cheaper still.

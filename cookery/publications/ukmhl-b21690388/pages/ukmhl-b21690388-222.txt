184 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 372. Nut Paste for Sandwiches. Ingredients. Two ounces of Pine kernels. Two ounces of Almonds. Four drops of Rose-water. Juice of one Orange. Thoroughly grind the nuts by putting them twice through a good nut mill. Put them on to a plate, and add the rose-water and mash them well with a knife or a wooden spoon; add the orange-juice last thing; and put into small pots and serve like potted meat. A nice addition to the breakfast-table ; eaten like potted meat. 373. Nut and Potato Patties. Ingredients. Five ounces of Potatoes. Two ounces of Pine kernels. Two ounces of Almonds, or Walnuts. One ounce of Butter. One tablespoonful of Cream. A little Parsley and Pepper. Well cook and mash the potatoes with the butter and cream, and cut into rounds about two inches thick, with a tumbler; cover with white of egg and bread- crumbs, and fry in boiling Albene until the outside is quite crisp. Take them out and drain them, and make a hole in the centre. Remove all the soft potato inside, or as much as possible without breaking the case. Grind the nuts together through a nut mill, and fill up the potato case with this. Or, if preferred, a filling of grated cheese is very nice, with a little chopped parsley on top. The above quantity will make six patties, and the value of each if filled with nuts or cheese is about eighty-six grains, or the equivalent of two and a half ounces of bread.

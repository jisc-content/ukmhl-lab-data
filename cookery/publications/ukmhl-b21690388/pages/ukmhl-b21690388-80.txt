A small teaspoonful of mixed Mustard. Boil the milk and pour it over the bread-crumbs and let them stand on the stove, covered up, for a quarter of an hour. Now mix in the grated cheese, mustard, and butter, and last of all the whites of eggs, which must be beaten to a rather stiff froth. Butter some little china ramequin cases, and fill them three parts full of the mixture. Bake for about ten minutes in a hot oven, and serve immediately. 76. Cheese Sandwiches. Ingredients. Grated Cheese. Bread and Butter. Mustard. Cut some nice thin slices of thin bread and butter, spread over them a very little mustard. Cover them evenly with a very thin layer of grated cheese, and place bread and butter over them. Press the slices of bread and butter together, pare off the outer crust, and cut into three-cornered pieces, and arrange on a napkin. These sandwiches are very nice eaten with either cucumber or lettuce without any dressing.

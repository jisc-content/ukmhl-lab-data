THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 220 443. Wine Sauce (German). Ingredients. One gill of Wine. | The whites of two Eggs. A dessertspoonful of castor Sugar. Beat up the whites of eggs to a froth—not too stiff. Put the sugar in the wine and make it hot, then beat it quickly to the whites of eggs. 444. Clarified Butter. Melt the butter, and let it get quite hot, but it must not boil. Skim it carefully, and pour it off the sedi- ment which will have settled at the bottom of the saucepan. Serve in a hot tureen. 445. Curd Cheese. Ingredients. One quart of Milk. | Juice of three Lemons. Put the milk into a basin, add the strained juice of the lemons to it, and let it stand in a temperature of about 54°, for twelve hours. Have ready a butter muslin about eighteen inches square, put it over a basin, and pour the curd into this, tie it round with string, and hang on a nail over a sink to drain for a few hours ; then put between two plates, with a weight on top, and press until all the moisture is pressed out. Turn out, and eat like ordinary cheese, or with sugar or fresh fruit.

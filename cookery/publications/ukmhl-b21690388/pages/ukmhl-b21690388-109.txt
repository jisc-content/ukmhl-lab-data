71 SAVOURIES Let them stew until the rice has absorbed all the milk, which will take quite two hours. Turn the mixture into a bowl, and let it get nearly cold. Now stir them, with the chopped parsley, into the cooled rice and season nicely with pepper. Beat up two of the whites of eggs into a stiff froth, and add that also to the mix- ture. Have the other white of egg beaten up slightly, take a tablespoonful of the mixture and dip it into the egg, then cover it with bread-crumbs. Shape them into cutlets an inch thick and put them into the frying basket. Fry them a rich brown and garnish with parsley. The cutlets are rather difficult to form, and a little patience is necessary to make them a success; but they quite repay the cook for her trouble when finished. If, however, she is not expert at this kind of work, it will be best for her to treat the mixture as in recipe for " Savoury Rice." 133. Savoury Rice Rissoles. Ingredients. Four ounces of Eice.

BREAD, PASTRY, CAKES, &c. 199 that the sediment may settle to the bottom. Skim off the froth very carefully and pour the oil in a basin, leaving the sediment at the bottom of the stewpan. Remove the sediment from the stewpan and pour back the oil—now clarified butter—and sprinkle in the flour gradually, stirring all the time. Put the stew- pan on a slow fire, or on a gas-ring, turned low, and stir continually with a wooden spoon. Keep scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent the mixture burning ; be very careful about the scraping and stirring or the roux will be spoiled. As soon as the mixture begins to colour, a very little, put half of it into a jar for white roux. It must not turn more than a cream colour, as it is intended to thicken white soups and white sauces. Now return the saucepan to the fire and continue the stirring and scraping until the remaining roux has become a bright brown. Be careful that it does not get too dark; a light chocolate colour is the correct shade. Immediately the roux is dark enough, remove it from the stove at once, but continue stirring for some minutes, as enamelled stewpans retain the heat after they have been removed from the fire, and the mixture would burn if the stirring was discontinued at once. Have ready a large slice of onion and throw it into the roux, if there is any fear that it is getting too dark ; this checks the heat at once. This is brown roux for thickening brown soups and gravies. It will keep for weeks, and although the process seems rather trouble- some, it really in the end saves time. In using the roux it is best to scrape oft' the quantity you require with a spoon, and not add it to the soups and sauces in a lump.

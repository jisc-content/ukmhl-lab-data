Put the milk with the peppercorns, loosely tied in muslin, in a saucepan to get hot on the stove. Fry the onion in the butter until a very pale yellow (it must not brown), add it to the milk, and let it boil up, and then simmer for an hour. Rub the carrots through a sieve. Remove the peppercorns from the milkâ€”squeezing the muslin well in doing so to extract the flavour. Pour the milk through the sieve and rub the onion through. Mix smoothly, and return the soup to the saucepan and boil it up. Thicken with either the white roux or the corn flour. If the corn flour is used, be careful to mix it smoothly first with cold milk.

52 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 95. Macaroni (Neapolitan). Ingredients. Half a pound Zita Macaroni (large pipe). Four ounces Flour. White of one Egg. One teacupful of Milk. One pound of Tomatoes. One ounce Butter. One Parmesan Cheese. Half a pint of Salad Oil. Pepper to taste. Break the macaroni into one-inch lengths and throw it into plenty of boiling water. Scald the onion and stick a few cloves into it, and add to it the macaroni, and boil quickly until the macaroni is cooked, but not broken. Pour off the water and drain well. Have ready a batter made of the egg, milk, and flour, made by putting the flour into a basin, and put the egg into the middle of it, and add the milk slowly, stirring all the time, till half of it is used. Then beat the batter well till bubbles form on the top. Add the rest of the milk and let it stand till the macaroni is cooked. This makes the batter lighter. Cut the tomatoes in halves, and put them on a buttered baking-tin in a moderate oven, with the rest of the ounce of butter in small bits on the top of them. Bake till just tender, but not broken. Make the salad oil very hot in a saucepan. When the macaroni is drained from the water, throw four or five bits of it into the hot oil. If it browns quickly put in the other bits and fry a light brown. Lift out of the oil, drain on white paper, re-heat the oil, and continue to dip in batter and fry in oil all the rest of the macaroni: Put the tomatoes in a ring, round a deep fire-proof dish. Heap the fried macaroni in the centre. Put a border of the grated cheese round the outside edge of the ring of tomatoes. Make very hot

SWEETS 105 206. Apple Jelly (No. 2). Ingredients. Six pounds of Apples. | Three pints of Water. Lump Sugar. Peel, core, and cut up the apples, and bake in a stew- jar with three pints of water. When a pulp, turn into a jelly-bag and hang over a pan all night to let all juice through. To every pint of juice add one pound of lump sugar, and boil one hour ; when properly done it will be stiff. Put into air-tight jars. 207. Apple Mould. Ingredients. Four pounds of Apples. | One pound of lump Sugar. Wipe the apples quite clean, core and cut them up, and put in a stew-jar in the oven with a little sugar sprinkled over, and stew till quite soft, and allow to cool. When cold rub through a sieve. Rinse a preserving pan with cold water and put in the pulp, together with the sugar, and boil about half an hour, stirring all the time. It requires great care to prevent burning, and must be boiled quickly or it will not set firmly in the mould (which must be rinsed with cold water last thing before putting in the jelly).

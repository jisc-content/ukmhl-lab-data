VEGETABLES 85 162. Cucumber (Stewed). Ingredients. Two or three fresh CucumberB. One tablespoonful of Cream. One ounce of Butter. Two tablespoonfuls of Milk. One ounce of Flour. Peel the cucumbers, cut them into quarters length- ways, remove the seeds (unless very young ones), wash them, and then throw them into boiling water for fifteen minutes. Take them out carefully with a slice, and let them drain. Make a sauce as follows : Melt the butter, add the flour, and stir well, pour the milk on, and let it boil for five minutes, then add the cream. Put the cucumber in this sauce, make it very hot, and serve. Instead of flour and butter use white roux for thick- ening if preferred. 163. Endive (Dressed). Ingredients. Two heads of Endive. Pepper. One ounce of Butter. Croutons. Wash the endive very well and throw it into fast boiling water, let it boil for ten minutes, and then change the water. It should boil for another twenty minutes, and the flavour would be improved if the water were changed again during that time ; this takes off the bitterness. Drain it very dry and chop it. Season it with pepper, add the butter, and toss it in a stewpan until it is quite hot. Serve with croutons.

THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 64 118. Rice Boiled for Curry. Ingredients. Rice. | Water. | Butter. The rice should be picked over but not washed. Throw it into plenty of quickly boiling water, and let it boil up, and continue to boil quickly for one minute1. Then pour in a very little cold water to check it. It should now boil slowly, but continuously, for fifteen to twenty miuutes. It is boiled enough if the grains are soft when pressed between the thumb and finger. Drain it, and return it to the saucepan, which should be dried and buttered. Cover it with a clean cloth and allow it to steam on the stove, where it is not too hot, or in a slow oven. Stir it lightly with a fork and let it remain for a quarter of an hour. Each grain should then swell up and be well separated. 119. Rice and Cheese (No. i). Ingredients.

xxiii HINTS ON COOKING digestion. This should be done first, no matter how the onions are to be cooked afterwards; and, of course, they must be well drained before proceeding to do anything else with them. One often hears complaints about the salad oil for salads; often, however, it is not the oil which is to blame at all, but the vinegar. Malt vinegar should never be used with oil, for it imparts an exceedingly disagreeable flavour to the salad, for which the oil is often blamed. If the same oil is used in conjunction with French vinegar the flavour will generally be found to be quite right. The best oil should always be used for salads, Sec.; there is another oil for frying quite good enough for the purpose, and much cheaper. Care should be taken in mixing salads to use as little vinegar as possible. The recipes give the proportion, but some people would be better with even less ; because it is the vinegar in the salad which generally disagrees with people. Let the lettuce be quite dry—it should be tossed in a cloth after washing and draining—and it must be torn with the fingers into suitable pieces for eating. Lettuce should never be cut. A bit of onion should always be added, but care should be taken that it is finely minced in the bowl in which the salad is mixed. It is best scalded first if the salad is for a delicate person. A nut mill is almost a necessity for any one living on this diet; for even if nuts are not largely used, almonds for flavouring are always better for going through the mill before they are pounded. The nut mills supplied by T. J. Bilson and Co., 88 Gray's Inn Road, London, W.C., have been found by the authors to be very good.

Another way of serving the macaroni makes a prettier dish :—Instead of adding the cheese and butter to the macaroni in the stewpan, a layer of the macaroni may be put at the bottom of a well-buttered French baking-dish, and part of the cheese scattered over it; then the rest of the macaroni must be put over the cheese, and the remainder of the cheese used as before. The top should be covered with fine bread-crumbs, and the butter broken up in bits and placed over the top. The dish should now be placed in a hot oven and quickly browned. [Note.—It is necessary to stir the macaroni occasionally when boiling quickly in the water, and after the milk has been added, it must be stirred frequently, or it will stick to the pan and spoil.] (See Macaroni, " Hints on Cooking.") 90. Macaroni and Cheese Pudding. Ingredients. Four ounces Macaroni. Three ounces grated Cheese. One ounce white Bread-crumbs. Four Sage leaves. Half a large Spanish Onion. Whites of two Eggs. Pepper to taste. Break the macaroni into three-and-a-half-inch lengths and put into boiling water, and let boil for half an hour; then drain, and when cool, line a well-buttered pudding basin with the macaroni, and fill in with the following mixture: Scald the onion and chop very finely with the sage leaves, add the cheese and bread-crumbs. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and mix well; fill the basin with this, and cover with macaroni, then a cloth, and steam for three hours. Rice may take the place of macaroni for a change.

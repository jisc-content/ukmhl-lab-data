BREAD, PASTRY, CAKES, &c. 380. "Apsley" Rusks. This form of toasted bread is much more easily digested than toast, as it is more completely cooked. The bread used in making the rusks must be at least three or four days old; new bread is difficult to cut into thin slices. The oven must be moderate, and the time taken in cook- ing will vary with its heat, averaging from twenty minutes to half an hour. Cut the bread thinly and place on the oven shelf, or on a slide that fits on to the oven shelf and can be taken in and out easily. The rusks must be carefully watched and turned as they become brown on one side, and should be made fresh each day. Use what are left over each day for making " Rusk Crumbs or Raspings.'" 381. Bannocks. Ingredients. One pound of fine Oatmeal. One ounce of Butter. Half an ounce of Baking-powder. Mix together the oatmeal and baking-powder, rub in the butter, and make it into a stiff dough with water. Roll out as thin as possible, cut into rounds with a tumbler. Butter a frying-pan, and cook a few at a time; when done on one side turn carefully. Serve with butter or golden syrup. Any left over can be put in the oven and made hot again.

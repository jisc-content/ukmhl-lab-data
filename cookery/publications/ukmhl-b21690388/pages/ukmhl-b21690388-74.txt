36 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 63. Cheese Fingers. Ingredients. Two slices of Toast. One tablespoonful of Cream. Two tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan. Two ounces of Sweet Almonds. Pepper to taste. One tablespoonful of chopped Parsley. Blanch the almonds and cut them in four, fry in the butter till a golden brown, and drain well. Mix together the cream and cheese, pepper, and chopped parsley, and spread the mixture on the toast; cut into lengths about one and a half inches wide, sprinkle the almonds on top, and serve very hot. 64. Cheese Fritters. Ingredients. Two ounces of grated Cheese. Half a pint of Milk. Two ounces of Flour. The white of one Egg. Salad Oil, or Albene. Mix the milk, a little at a time, very smoothly with the flour, and let it stand for two hours or more; it must be covered. Now mix in the grated cheese. Beat the white of egg until it is all froth, but it need not be very stiff, and add that also to the batter. Have some salad oil, or "Albene," hot enough for frying (see "Hints on Cooking1'), and put in the batter a table- spoonful at a time. As the fritters are cooked remove them with a fish-slice and put them on an inverted sieve to drain. Keep the batter mixed as each tablespoonful is taken out. Serve as hot as possible, piled up on a dish.

THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 80 152. Brussels Sprouts, Dressed with Butter. Ingredients. One pound of Sprouts. | Half an ounce of Butter. Pepper. Prepare and boil the sprouts as in the preceding recipe, but when drained dry them in a clean cloth. Dissolve the butter in a pan and shake the sprouts in it over the fire for a few minutes; season them with pepper, and serve very hot. 153. Cabbage in a Mould. Ingredients. A large Savoy Cabbage. Two ounces of Butter. Pepper. Any kind of cabbage will do for this dish, but Savoy is best. Prepare and wash it carefully. Put it into plenty of fast boiling water with a small bit of soda. The water will, of course, stop boiling when the cabbage is put in, but it should be brought to boiling-point as quickly as possible. Let it boil until tender, which should be in from thirty to forty minutes. Drain it well and chop it. Stir in the butter; season nicely with pepper, press it into a buttered mould, and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. Turn out, and serve. This dish is very nice with little moulds of white of egg. (See " White of Egg in Moulds.")

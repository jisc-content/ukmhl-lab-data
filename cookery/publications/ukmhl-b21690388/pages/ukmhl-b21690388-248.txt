210 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK add the lemon-juice and beat well. It should be like a thin batter. (If well corked will keep for five days.) 422. Salad (Mixed). Ingredients. A small Cob Lettuce. The third part of a small Cucumber. A slice of Onion. A few slices of Beetroot. Oil and French Vinegar. Pepper. Wash the lettuce very carefully and drain it. Have a clean cloth ready. Tear the lettuce in convenient pieces for eating, and toss it in the cloth to dry. Peel and slice the cucumber. Take the slice of onion—which must not be larger than a shilling, and very thin—put it at the bottom of the salad bowl, and mince it very fine. Now arrange the lettuce, cucumber, and beetroot in layers. Mix well whilst adding the oil and vinegar, dusting in a little pepper from time to time as it is being mixed. The proportion of oil to vinegar should be one part vinegar and three of oil. Salad should not be too wet; and when mixed all the oil and vinegar used should adhere to the lettuce, &c, and not be in the bowl. Nothing but practice will teach the exact quan- tity of oil and vinegar to use. It is impossible to give the exact quantities, as the lettuce may vary in size. A salad in which cucumber is used will always be more moist than one made of lettuce alone.

INTRODUCTION XV " If this man lives and works in the open air, he may have such a good appetite for bread, macaroni, rice, potatoes, nuts and fruit, that no milk and cheese will be required; but those who live in towns and are more sedentary, will generally require to add these latter to a greater or less extent." A few hints on cooking have also been given, as most of the dishes depend largely upon their careful prepara- tion for their appetising properties. When the com- paratively small range of foods which the diet allows is remembered, the difficulties of the authors in arranging the combination of foods and vegetables will be appre- ciated. In vegetarian cookery the range is much larger, hence the number of recipes which the books can boast. But if they were debarred from using the yolks of eggs, asparagus, mushrooms, and the whole of the pulses in their savouries, and chocolate and coffee in their sweets, the number of recipes would be consider- ably diminished. The authors are indebted to various friends for certain recipes, which they have kindly supplied, and which have been adapted to the diet; and especially to their respective cooks, for the intelligent interest and patience which they have shown in the working out of all the recipes.

VEGETABLES. 147. Artichokes. Ingredients. Three pounds of Jerusalem Artichokes. Peel and put them into cold water; if they are young put them into some boiling water and allow them to boil for twenty minutes ; but if old put them into cold water and let boil until tender. Drain them well, and place them in a vegetable dish, and pour over a little good white sauce. Serve at once or they may discolour. Sprinkle a little chopped parsley over them. 148. Artichokes (Green, Boiled). Ingredients. Green Artichokes. Clarified Butter, or Oil and Vinegar. Green artichokes are best plainly boiled and served with plain melted butter, or oil and vinegar. Well wash and trim the artichokes ; cut off the stalks so that they will stand. Boil them in plenty of water with the tops downwards, and let them boil gently, until the leaves can easily be removed. The chokes can be removed or not, according to taste, before they are dished. (See " Clarified Butter.")

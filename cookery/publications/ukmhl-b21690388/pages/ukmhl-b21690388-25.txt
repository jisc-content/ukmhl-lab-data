xvii HINTS ON COOKING The greatest possible care should also be taken with the saucepans, &c, in which it is cooked. Aluminium saucepans are the best for this purpose, for the milk is not so liable to burn in them as it is in enamelled saucepans, and they are much easier to keep clean. Although the first cost is much greater than the enam- elled saucepans, in the end they are certainly cheaper, for there is no enamel to wear off or become cracked. The cook must remember in cleaning them that no soda must be used or they will turn black ; if they are allowed to remain in plain water, there will be no difficulty whatever in cleaning them. They are to be bought at the Army and Navy Stores, or from any good iron- monger. The French fireproof ware will be found very good in the cooking of all dishes in which milk is used, and for stewing fruit. The " Marmites11 have the advantage of being cheap, and also of being very easily kept clean. The fireproof china dishes, &c, are a little more expen- sive, but they look very nice, and various savoury dishes which are sent to table in the utensils in which they are cooked look best when served in them. The milk boilers for use at table—which cannot boil over—are made in this ware, and are admirable in every way. A very good selection of these useful utensils is always to be found at the Army and Navy Stores. Double pans will also be found very convenient. Indeed, for the cooking of porridge and the preparation of many of the dishes containing milk for which recipes are given, they may almost be termed indispensable. The danger of burn- ing is avoided, and only careless stupidity in neglecting to keep the outer pan filled with water could produce

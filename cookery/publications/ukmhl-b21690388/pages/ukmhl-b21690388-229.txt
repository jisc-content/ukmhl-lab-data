BREAD, PASTRY, CAKES, &c. 191 386. Bread-Raspings (to Prepare). All pieces of bread should be put aside in a clean bowl, and when enough has been saved to fill a good- sized baking-tin, they should be baked in a slow oven until they are a rich golden colour all through. They should then be rolled on a pastry-board—a small quan- tity at a time—until they are fine enough for use, and then put into a biscuit-box with a well-fitting lid, which should be kept in a dry place. These raspings are used in many recipes for both sweet and savoury dishes, and a good supply should always be kept in hand. They are not only better and more easily digested than ordi- nary bread-crumbs for many dishes, but they are much more economical, and are the means of every scrap of bread being utilised. As the rolling would scratch and dent the board and rolling-pin used for pastry—and it is necessary to keep them perfectly smooth—a special rolling-pin and board should be kept for this purpose. 387.

To make a very good sultana bread take a quarter of the dough—made according to preceding recipe— and put it to rise with the loaves; and then, before putting it into a tin, work the sultanas and sugar into it. The sultana loaf must, be baked exactly like the other bread.

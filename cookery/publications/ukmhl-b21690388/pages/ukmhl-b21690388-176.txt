A quarter of a pound each of can- died Citron, Orange, and Lemon. One pound of Sugar. One teaspoonful of Cinnamon. Half a grated Nutmeg. Half a saltspoonful of pow- dered Cloves. Two sherry-glassfuls of Brandy. Pick and wash the currants, stone the raisins. Peel and slice the apples ; they must be weighed after they are prepared. Shred very finely the citron, orange, and lemon. Put them all into a large bowl, and mix them well, and then chop them either on a chopping-board or in a chopping-bowl. When the fruit has been suffi- ciently chopped return it to the large bowl, and mix in the sugar and spices. Put the mince-meat in a jar and pour the brandy over it. When it is used it should be well mixed,and until it is required must be kept very care- fully covered. A dessertspoonful of mince-meat should be put into a three-inch pie; and as there is no suet in the mince-meat, a piece of butter, the size of a hazel-nut, must be placed in the middle of the mince-meat in each pie. 280.

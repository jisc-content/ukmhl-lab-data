196 THE APS LEY COOKERY BOOK the paste, leaving a margin of quite an inch to allow for the butter spreading in rolling. Dredge with flour, and fold in three, then roll out until the paste is an inch thick. Treat the other half in exactly the same manner, using the third portion of butter. When this is done, place the two pieces on the top of one another, and roll out until only half an inch thick. Now fold the paste and place it between two dishes, and put it aside in a cool place until next day. When rolling out the paste for tarts, take care to keep it one way of the grain. If in using the cuttings they are placed straight, one on top of the other, the last bit of paste will be as light and flaky as the first used. 397. Paste, Puff (Old Recipe.) Ingredients. One pound of Flour. | One pound of Butter. A teaspoonful of Baking-powder. Take three ounces of the flour from the pound, to use for working up the paste, and put the remainder in a bowl and mix it well with the baking-powder. Divide the butter into four portions, and rub one into the flour, then mix with as much water as will make a perfectly smooth paste. Now roll out the paste to the thickness of a shilling, and break up the butter into bits the size of a hazel-nut, and place them over the paste. Dredge lightly with some of the flour taken out for working. Be careful to leave a margin of an inch, to allow for the butter spreading in the rolling. Fold the paste into four, and roll out again to the thickness of a shilling. Repeat these directions exactly, in working in the third and fourth parts of the butter.

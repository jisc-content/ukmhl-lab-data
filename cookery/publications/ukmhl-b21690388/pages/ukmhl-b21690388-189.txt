One Bay leaf. Half a pint of Milk. One tablespoonful of Sugar. Take enough milk from the pint to mix the rice smoothly. Put the remainder in an enamelled saucepan with the bay leaf, and let it remain until the milk is nicely flavoured. If lemon flavour is preferred, use the thin rind of half a lemon. Remove the flavouring and add the sugar, and pour over the mixed rice, stirring as the milk is poured in. Return the mixture to the saucepan, and boil until the rice leaves the spoon easily, stirring the whole time. Pour into a damp mould, and let it stand in a cool place for three or four hours before turning out. Serve stewed fruit or custard with the blancmange. 308. Rice Cakes (Small). Ingredients.

A few Cherries, Bananas, Apricots, Strawberries, &c. Boil the water and sugar together to a syrup. Cut up what fruit is required and put into a dish, and pour the boiling syrup over and let stand until cold. Then sprinkle in the nuts; mix very lightly.

I Oil and French Vinegar. A slice of Onion. Pepper. Wash the lettuce very carefully and put it in a sieve to drain. Have ready a clean cloth, and tear up the lettuce in convenient pieces for eating (never cut lettuce for salad), toss them lightly in the cloth until they are dry. Fut a thin slice of onion, about the size of a shilling, at the bottom of the salad bowl and mince it as finely as possible, and add the lettuce to the onion. Dust in some pepper, and add two tablespoonfuls of oil and a dessertspoonful of vinegar ; mix very thoroughly, and 6erve at once. French vinegar must always be used with oil. Malt vinegar imparts a very disagreeable taste to the salad, for which the oil is often blamed.

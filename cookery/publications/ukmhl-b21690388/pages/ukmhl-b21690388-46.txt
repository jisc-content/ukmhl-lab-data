8 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK them to the milk, which must have been heating on the stove, with the white peppercorns tied loosely in muslin. Let them boil up, and then simmer for an hour. Re- move the cloves and peppercorns. Thicken with either the white roux or the corn flour. If the corn flour is used it must be first mixed smoothly with a little cold milk. (See " Hints on Cooking.11) Let it boil up, and serve with toasted bread cut in dice. 13. Leek Soup (Brown). Ingredients. Four Leeks. One quart of Water. Eight tablespoonfuls of grated dry Cheddar Cheese. One and a half ounces of Butter. One spot of Parisian Essence. Twelve black Peppercorns. Remove the outer leaves and trim the roots of the leeks. Divide them lengthwise into quarters, and cut them into pieces an inch long. Wash them quite free from gritâ€”be very careful about this as they are diffi- cult to wash. Put them into cold water and bring them quickly to boiling-point; let them boil three minutes. Drain them, and fry a light brown in the butter. Now put them in a saucepan with the water and the black peppercorns loosely tied in muslin; let them boil up quickly and then simmer gently for an hour. Remove the peppei'corns and squeeze the muslin well, to extract all the flavour. Put the grated cheese at the bottom of a warm soup tureen. Pour the soup, which must have boiled up again, over the cheese, stirring all the time, and serve with toasted bread cut in dice.

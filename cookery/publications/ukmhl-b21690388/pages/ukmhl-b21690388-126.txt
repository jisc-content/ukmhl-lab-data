THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 168. Onions (Boiled). Ingredients. Six large Spanish Onions. | Two ounces of Butter. One ounce of Flour. Peel the onions and pour sufficient boiling water over them to cover them; let them stand for ten minutes, and then take them out of the hot water, and put-them into a saucepan with cold water; let boil for two hours. Drain well, and serve with plain melted butter poured over. 169. Onions Stewed (Brown). Ingredients. Two pounds of Onions. Two ounces of Butter. A teaspoonful of Flour. Pepper. Half a pint of Water. If large Spanish onions are used they should be cut in halves, horizontally; but if the onions are only about double the size of an egg, they may be cooked whole. Peel them and put them into cold water, and let them boil up quickly and continue boiling gently for five minutes, then drain them. Now put them into a stew- pan with the butter and let them stew gently for three hours. The onions should be turned once during the cooking, and if they are in halves they should be placed first on the round end, and finished with the cut side down. Great care should be taken in turning them, as they should not be broken. If quite small onions are used, only about the size of an egg, two hours and a half would be sufficient to stew them, but unless the onions are quite tender the dish will be spoiled. When

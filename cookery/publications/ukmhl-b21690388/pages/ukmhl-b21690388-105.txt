SAVOURIES 67 cut them up, taking out all hard parts, and bake them in a shallow dish in the oven. When cooked beat them into the rice, add the butter, and serve very hot. 125. Rissoles (Savoury). Ingredients. Two ounces of Bread-raspings. Two ounces of grated Cheese. Four ounces of mashed Potatoes. One heaped tablespoonful of chopped Parsley. Four ounces of Onion. The whites of four Eggs. A saltspoonful of Pepper. Two tablespoonfuls of Milk. Oil, or Albene. Put the bread-crumbs, cheese, potatoes, parsley, and pepper into a bowl, large enough to mix them thoroughly. Peel and slice the onion and throw it into cold water; let it boil up quickly and remain boiling for one minute, then drain it and chop it finely, and add it to the other ingredients in the bowl. Mix all thoroughly, and moisten with the beaten whites of egg and the milk. Mix again very carefully and cover the mixture, and let it stand for at least four hours. Now form it into any shape preferred, and fry in either salad oil, or Albene. (See " Hints on Cooking.") Prepare the bread-raspings according to recipe given. The ris- soles are equally good either hot or cold; but it must be remembered that they are intended as a relish to plainer food. They are very nourishing, being weight for weight of rather more value than beef and mutton.

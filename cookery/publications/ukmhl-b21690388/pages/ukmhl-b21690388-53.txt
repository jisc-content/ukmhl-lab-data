SOUPS AND PUREES 15 milk with a little pepper and nutmeg. Let them simmer gently until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked. Pass all through a sieve and put in double saucepan and boil again ; add the butter and cream, and serve with fried croutons. A little parsley may added if liked, and this soup is very good made with half water and half milk. 26. Rice and Tomato Soup. Ingredients. One tablespoonful of Rice. One quart of Milk. One pound of Tomatoes. One ounce of Butter. Four ounces of Onions. One dozen white Peppercorns. Throw the rice into plenty of slightly salted water, and let it boil slowly for twenty minutes or until tender. It should boil quickly for two or three minutes at first. Drain it, and keep it warm until it is wanted. Slice the onions and throw them into cold water, let them first boil and then drain them. Now fry them in a stewpan in the butter, a very light yellow. Slice the tomatoes and add them to the onions, and let all simmer slowly—so that the mixture will not become dry—for half an hour. The milk—with the peppercorns tied loosely in muslin—must in the meantime be heating on the stove. Let it boil up before adding it to the onion and tomato, when all should simmer together for a quarter of an hour. Remove the peppercorns, squeezing the muslin well to extract all the flavour; pour all into a sieve and rub the tomato and onion through. Mix smoothly and return to the pan. Add the rice, with salt to taste, and let all boil up together. Serve very hot.

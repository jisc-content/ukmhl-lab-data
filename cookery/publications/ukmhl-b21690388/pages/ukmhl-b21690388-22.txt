xiv THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK " We generally depend for our nitrogen upon substances containing albumens, and it is the habit of tins country at the present day to get it almost entirely from animal albumens, in ignorant disregard of the poison that animal tissues contain. " It can be calculated from the data given in works on Physiology that a man, in order to get enough nitrogen, must be supplied with from 8 to 11 grs. of albumen per day for each pound of body weight. Children require more; thus a child of 35 lbs. weight may require as much as an adult three times its weight, and this gradually diminishes until the adult standard is reached, while old and sedentary people may require considerably less than the adult allowance. "And now, applying the rule of the relation of albumen to body weight : " A young adult weighing (after reducing weight of clothing) ten stone, or 140 lbs., and leading a hard-working life, would have to consume 140x 10 =1400 grs. of albumen per day, and these might be got as follows : " 17 ozs. bread (8 per cent, albu- mens = 34 grs. per oz.) . . = 578 grs. " 2 pints milk (3 per cent, albu- mens = 13 grs. per oz.) . . = 525 grs. " J oz. cheese (33 per cent, al- bumens = 140 grs. per oz.) . = 140 grs. " 2 ozs. rice (5 per cent, albu- mens = 21 grs. per oz.) . . = 43 grs. "12 oz. vegetables and fruit (2 per cent, albumens = 8 grs. per oz.) . . = 114 grs. 1400 grs.

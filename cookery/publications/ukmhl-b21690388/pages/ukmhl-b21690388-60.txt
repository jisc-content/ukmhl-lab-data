Two sticks of Celery. One quart of Milk. One ounce of Butter. Four ounces of Onions, One dozen white Peppercorns. One tablespoonful of either white Roux or a bare dessertspoon- ful of Corn Flour. Cut the turnips in quarters and let them boil quickly for half an hour, then drain them. Slice the onions, throw them in cold water, bring them quickly to boil- ing-point, then drain them immediately and fry them in the butter a pale yellow. Now add them to the milk, which must have been boiled with the pepper- corns (tied in a bit of muslin). Cut the celery in two- inch lengths, and add that also with the turnips to the milk. Let all stew together until the turnip is tender, which should be in half an hour. Remove the pepper- corns and pour into a sieve. Rub all the vegetables through and return to the saucepan. Thicken with either white roux or corn flour. If corn flour is used it must be first smoothly mixed with a little cold milk. (See " Hints on Cooking.11) Boil up after the thicken- ing has been added. Serve with either croutons or toasted bread cut in dice.

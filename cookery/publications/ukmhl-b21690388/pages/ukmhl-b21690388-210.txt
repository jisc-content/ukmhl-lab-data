172 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 349. Almond Soup. Ingredients. Four ounces of Almonds. One quart of Milk. Six Cloves. One small blade of Mace. Four ounces of Onions. One ounce of Butter. Two dozen white Peppercorns. A tablespoonful of white Roux, or a small dessertspoonful of Corn Flour. Put the milk in a saucepan with the cloves, mace, and peppercorns ; bring it to boiling-point, and let it stand on the stove, where it will just simmer. Slice the onions, and fry them in the butter a pale golden colour ; be very careful not to let them brown. Now add them to the milk and let it boil up once more, then set it aside to simmer for half an hour; strain it, and allow it to cool. Blanch the almonds, put them through a nut mill, then pound them well in a mortar, addhig one drop of water occasionally to prevent them oiling. When the almonds are well pounded and the milk is cool, add the milk, a little at a time, to the almond paste, mixing it as smoothly as possible until it is all used. Now boil up the soup, stirring all the time. Thicken with either a tablespoonful of white roux, or a bare dessertspoonful of corn flour. ("See Hints on Cook- ing.") Boil up again. Serve with croutons.

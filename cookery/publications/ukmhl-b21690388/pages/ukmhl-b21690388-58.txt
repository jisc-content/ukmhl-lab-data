THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 20 the roux. With half the butter add pepper and nut- meg, and stand the saucepan where it will keep very hot but not boil. Pour boiling water on the tomatoes, when the skin will come off easily, cut them into rather thick slices, and cook for fifteen minutes in a small saucepan with the other half ounce of butter. Add all together, make very hot, and serve with fried croutons. 35. Tomato Soup (Brown). Ingredients. One pound of Tomatoes. Four ounces of Onions. One quart of Water. One and a half ounces of Butter. Eight tablespoonfuls of grated dry Cheddar Cheese. One spot of Parisian Essence. One dozen black Peppercorns. Slice the onions and throw them into cold water, bring them quickly to boiling-point, then drain them carefully. Now slice the tomatoes and fry them with the onions in the butter until they are a nice brown— not too dark. Add them to the water—which must be boiling—and the peppercorns, loosely tied in a bit of muslin. Boil up, and let them simmer for half an hour. Remove the peppercorns and pour the rest into a sieve, and rub the onions and tomato through. Now return to the saucepan, and boil up. Place the cheese at the bottom of a warm soup tureen, stir in the soup, and serve immediately. Send either croutons, or toast cut in dice, to table with the soup.

190 THE APSLEY COOKERY HOOK 385. Bread. Ingredients. Four pounds two ounces of Flour. Three-quarters of an ounce of Yeast. One pint and three-quarters of Water. A quarter of an ounce of Salt. An American bread-mixer should be used in making this bread. (See " Hints on Cooking.") Best seconds flour is better than superfine flour. The water must be warm, but not too hot to bear the hand in. Mix the yeast smoothly with the water, pouring in a little at a time until it is all used; add the salt, and stir all well together. Pour the liquid into the bread-mixer. Now add the flour, which must be sifted. Fasten the top on the mixer, and turn the handle for exactly three minutes. Remove the cover, and have ready a well- floured pastry-board. Take a large knife and remove the dough from the central screw, divide it into four equal parts, and place each part in a well-greased bread- tin. Let the tins stand in a warm place for one hour to rise. The plate rack above an ordinary kitchen stove is a good place. Then put them in a very mode- rately heated oven, and after the first twenty minutes increase the heat until it is hot, but not so hot as is required for pastry. The loaves must bake for one hour. Bread is much better baked in tins ; but if tins are not used, the dough must be divided into four, and formed into round cakes and placed on the oven shelves, which must be first floured. Three-quarters of an hour to rise, and the same time to bake, will then be quite long enough. Great care should be taken in weighing and measuring the quantities.

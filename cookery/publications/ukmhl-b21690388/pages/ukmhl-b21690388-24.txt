HINTS ON COOKING. It is as necessary to most people that their food should look nice as that it should have an agreeable taste; and although on this diet the cook has not the materials for much show, it is all the more important that she should make the best of what she has. If care is taken in following the recipes given, both the eye and the palate will be gratified; and the cook will have the satisfac- faction of knowing that the result is mainly due to her careful cooking. Indeed, this diet, though it would seem at first sight to give the cook but few opportuni- ties for showing her talents, yet gives her every chance of exercising both her taste and her ingenuity. As milk enters largely into the dishes which she has to prepare, one of the first things to impress upon the cook is the keeping of it fresh and sweet. It must never remain uncovered in the larder, as it will imme- diately take the flavour of anything that happens to be near it; and if it is put in the ice chest in hot weather, it must never be placed in the same compartment with either fruit or vegetables. Strawberries will impart a very disagreeable flavour to milk, if it stands uncovered anywhere near them ; any article of food that has the least smell will spoil its flavour, so that the only remedy is to keep milk carefully covered.

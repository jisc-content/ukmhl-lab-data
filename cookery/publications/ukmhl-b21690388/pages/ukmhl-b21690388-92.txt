Macaroni may be prepared exactly as in the pre- ceding recipe ; but instead of putting it into a French baking-dish it may be put in scallops, and the same directions followed. 98. Macaroni Scallops (No. i). Ingredients. Two ounces pipe Macaroni. Two tablespoonfuls Tomato Four ounces Parmesan Cheese. Sauce. Two ounces Butter, or Albene. Pepper to taste. Six Scallop shells. Cook the macaroni in half a pint of milk and water for half an hour. Drain and cut up into small pieces and add one ounce of the butter, with the pepper and all the cheese. Mix it well; grease the shells and put a little of the tomato sauce in each, then fill up with the macaroni; sprinkle with bread-crumbs and pieces of butter, and put them in the oven to brown for twenty minutes.

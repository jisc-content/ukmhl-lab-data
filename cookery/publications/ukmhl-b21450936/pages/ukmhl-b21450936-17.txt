By it a portion of the starch is first converted into suo-ar, then into alcohol and carbonic acid, the globules of which make bread light, and if the fermentation is continued, into acid, which makes it sour. Unleavened bread is sweeter and more nutritious than leavened. The sooner fermentation is checked by heat, the better the bread; but bakers want to make big loaves, and use alum to keep them from becoming sour. _ Good, wholesome bread is made of rye, barley, and maize, or their intermixtures.

If it be made of pure bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid in exactly neutralising proportions, it will make light and tasty bread.

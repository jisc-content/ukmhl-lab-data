No. 8 gives, with approximate accuracy, the proportions of beef and mutton, which, as sold by the butcher, if free from bone, and of ordinary fatness, contains about 70 per cent, of water—a very dear food, liable to be diseased, and giving, in many cases, a tendency to in- flammatory and congestive diseases. The chemical elements of food are the same as those which compose the body, the blood, and the milk—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, with certain mineral elements, as calcium and sodium, and also phos- phorus and sulphur. Milk and eggs are chemically^jej/eci foods for calves and chicks—that is, they contain all the elements of animal bodies in the needed pro- portions ; grains, pulse, and fruits are similarly constituted and best for adults. Wheat and grapes, for example, are perfect foods. The exact proportions of the several elements in varioits articles of food, including those illustrated in the above diagrams, are given in the following table :— Name of Footl. Wheat meal ...

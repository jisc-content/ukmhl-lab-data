DR. NICHOLS' BRILL'S SEA SALT. PENNY VEGETARIAN COOKERY. SOME REASONS WHY. HY" I write this Penny Vegetarian Cookery when there are already several good ones to be had, if one could find them, is that I think 1 may be able to make a better one by cutting what I like best from all of them, and adding a httle of my own, thus developing cookery books by "natural selection and the survival of the fittest." The reason why I write a Vegetancm Cookery is that, having heard a course of lectures on " Diet in its relations to Health," by Sylvester Graham, in 1834, when n. , r 11 ^ at theageof 19,1 was attending my first course of medical lectures at Dartmouth College N H USA T adopted the vegetarian diet with the daily bath, and other hv-iemV habits, to the great improvement of my health, and with the result that from that day to this I have never had one hour's seiions illnes, nor ever been hindered one day from my ordinary avocations As ^ martter of taste the disuse of flesh meat has been no sacrifice and T have found a diet of bread, fruit, and vegetables, with some ^se foJ convenience of milk and eggs, sufficient, satisfying, healthful and delicious^ This a^o has been the experience of iillLsf n fact of four-fifths of the human race in all ages. ' The reason why people should adopt a vegetarian diet is that it the best in every possible way. This is now admitted by he hil e fc medical and scientific authorities.

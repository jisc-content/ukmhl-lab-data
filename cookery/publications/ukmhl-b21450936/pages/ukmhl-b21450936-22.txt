AH Purchasers of this Liifle Book should Read this Pa^e. From the late Dr. ANNA KINGSFORD:— " When your child is able to masticate you can give such foods as porridge. Nichols' ' Food of Health' is the best I know of for the purpose." From Dr. E. HAUGHTON, M.R.C.S., Upper Norwood:— " I have frequently prescribed the ' Food of Health' introduced by Dr. Nichols. I am well satisfied with it as a highly nutritious and easily digestible Food." From the Rey. G. Y. CHICHESTER, Wotton Rectory, Dorking:— " The Farina called Nichols'' Food of Health-' has proved an important article of diet so far, not only for its sustaining qualities, but for other valuable properties in a medicinal point of view." From the ReY. C. W. BALDWIN, Tydd St. Mary Rectory, Wisbech:— " We have tried your ' Food of Health' in many cases of delicate children and sick people, and find it most efficacious." From the Rev. WALTER GILL, Congregational Minister, Parkstone, near Poole: — '• I have pleasure in saying that the claims put forward in reference to the ' Food of Health' have been fully justified in the experience of very many in this neighbourhood, in some cases most markedly so." From Mrs. J. WRIGHT, 2, Avon Place, Barker Square, Birmingham:— _ '• I have a baby not twelve months old that has been suffering with inflamma- tion of the bowels. We had the advice of two doctors, but what they prescribed did not seem to help him, in fact they both gave him up. We were recommended to try Dr. Nichols' ' Food of Health'; we did so, and I am pleased to tell you it was the cause of his ultimate recovery, and the child is now getting on wonderfully well. I have recommended it to others, and I think the least I can say is, that if mothers only knew the good qualities it contains, they would not hesitate to use it." From Mr. J, WILLSHER, Schoolmaster, 12th Lancers, ShornclifFe :— • My wife desires me to forward to you her opinion of the ' Food of Health.' We have reared three boys, and lost two, and two girls—babies—through nothing else than insufficient and improper food. Our last and eighth baby was weaned at SIX weeks. I obtained some of your ' Food of Health,' and the baby has thriven wonderfully ; in fact, we have had daily inquiries from people, ' What do you feed the baby on ?' Now, we have tried every kind of food in the market, and can conscientiously say that not one can even compare with ours. Our baby is simply a picture, not of fat, but of health—solid flesh; moreover she has not required a dose of medicine since she began using it. She is so fond of it, and so are the other children ; so am I." ^'""wi'^'"' ®: *• WHITEHORNE, 38, Green St., St. Heller's, Jersey:- • writing permit me to say that I am receiving day by day most raarkea improvement from the use of your ' Food of Health.'

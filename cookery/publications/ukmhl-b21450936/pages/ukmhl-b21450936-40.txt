KICE AND TOMATOES—Boil the rice as above, add a little pepper, salt, and butter to it, put on a warm dish, and place baked fresh tomatoes on the top, the juice that drains from the tomatoes being poured over them. If the tinned tomatoes are used, these may be stirred amongst the rice when it is done, the whole again warmed through, and then served. This dish should be eaten with a green vegetable of some sort. EICE AND LENTILS.—Boil the rice as above; stew Egyptian lentils with chopped onions, pepper, salt, and a little butter, until well done. Put the rice on a dish, pour over the stewed onions and lentils, serve, and eat with green vegetables. KICE AND ONIONS.—Boil whole onions in water until done quite through, remove them from the water, and put in it washed rice, with a little pepper, salt, and butter. When done, serve with the onions, and eat with a green vegetable. . Eice should be avoided by the stout, the costive, and those troubled with varicose veins, piles, etc., but it may be freely eaten by the thin. NITEOGENOUS FOODS.—These foods are such as dried peas, beans, and lentils. They are very strong foods, and should be used chiefly by labourers or those engaged in outdoor or indoor hard physical work. As they are very flatulent, they should be avoided by those to whom this is objectionable. DBIED FEAS.—These can be boiled for some hours with onions, carrots, and turnips, pepper and salt, and may be eaten cool with wholemeal bread. A pleasant accompaniment is sago, soaked and added about twenty to thirty minutes before the stew is served up. If the sago is added much earlier the stew will have a tendency to " catch " or burn. Pea flour can be added to vegetable soup, a table- spoonful to a quart, just rubbed smooth with a little cold water and well stirred in. PEASE BBOSE is made by the Scottish peasant in this way. He puts some pea flour into a basin, and pours boiling water over it, at the same time stirring and thoroughly mixing the meal and water together. When mixed, he adds a little salt, pepper, and butter, and eats it with or without oatcake. BEANS.—In France these are called the "poor man's meat," and are very nutritious. ^ They are cooked in a variety of ways ; when plainly boiled they may be eaten with potatoes and vegetables at dinner ; a little parsley s.auce goes well with them. The water they are boiled in makes a good stock for soups. BEAN PIE is made from boiled beans, which are put in a pie dish ; soaked tapioca, flavouring herbs, pepper, salt, and butter are added; a cup of water is poured in to make the gravy, a crust is put on the top, and then baked for an hour or so. This is a tasty dish. Cold beans are very nice if warmed in a frying pan with oil or butter, and may be eaten with potatoes, vegetables, and sauce. Mashed beans, flavoured with pepper, salt, and mace, and put into pots, make an excellent 8ub.stitut« for potted meat. LENTILS.—The red Egyptian kind make vegetable soup very tasty.

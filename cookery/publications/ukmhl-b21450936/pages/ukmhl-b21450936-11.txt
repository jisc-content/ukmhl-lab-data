BRILL'S SEA SALT. when a vegetarian diet is found to be not only the most healthy, but abundantly su&cient for all the wants of man From the earliest times the labour of the world has been done by people living on the simplest vegetable food-on rice, maize, rye wheat barley, and oats; on bananas, supposed to be the food of primiti;e mTn dates, hgs, grapes, oranges, apples, pears, peaches, acorns, walnuts chest- nuts, cocoanuts, etc etc. Oui- ancestors lived ^n acorns, bar ey and berries and fru ts Scotland and Ireland have rais'ed milLs of trong men and beau l ul women on oatmeal and potatoes. Until re- cen% the agricultural labourers of England seldom tasted flesh, beyond a bit of bacon on Sunday. The great populations of India and China are fed almost entn-ety upon a vegetable cUet. So are the haid worW peasantry all oyer Europe, from Spain and Portugal to Rus^a and Tm^key, where the strongest and hardiest men in the wor d may be seen living on brown bread and figs, grapes and water-melons. ^ coZoZ7Sl^&"'"'"^fV' ^^^'^^-^y ^ore economical than one composed of fish, flesh, and fowl. A pound of maize costs three-farthin-s a pound of wheat a penny, and either contains more nutriment haS three pounds of beef, which, as .vill be seen in our diagrams, is neaX three-foiurths water. An acre of ground, planted with banana-trees, will feed twenty-five (Humboldt says thirty) men. An acre of good English land may produce sixty bushels of wheat, while it requires from six to ten acres to produce an equivalent quantity of beef or mutton. The oat- meal required to fatten a pig is worth more than six times as much as the pork It makes for food, while it is better in every way before being converted into pig. But for the economies of a vegetarian diet read How TO Live on Sixpence a Day," or, what is better, try the ex- periment. Sixpence a day is a very liberal allowance. The food of the pat mass of the English people for centuries has not averaged as much. It is quite possible for any healthy man or woman to live on 6d. or _2d. a day A penny will often buy a pound of wheat, two pounds of maize or Indian corn two pounds of potatoes, a pound of Spanish onions, half a pound of dates, a quarter of a pound of raisins, etc Anv average person can live perfectly well on twenty-four ounces of food a day, not including the water.* Here it is then : Wheat, maize oat- meal rice, are almost perfect foods, containing the matter required to build up and restore every part of the body.

Dr. Nichols' Food of Health. 12 SKILL'S SEA SALT. OF FRUIT. As fruit, after milk, which is the first food of all animals of the class Mammalia, was the original, and is the most natural food of man, let us begin with fruit. All good ripe fruits are best eaten in their natural state. Fresh ripe grapes, strawberries, peaches, apricots, and mellow pears and apples cannot be improved by cookery. Unripe goosebein-ies and apples and the coarser kinds of pears may be stewed or baked, as in tarts, adding the sugar they have not yet made. As sugar preserves fruit, it also is apt to preserve it in the stomach, making it difficult of digestion—therefore put in no more than is needful. Fruit should form a portion of every meal—not at the end of a meat dinner, but rather at the beginning of every meal, especially at breakfast. Figs and raisins are as heai'ty as bread—and, like brown bread, wheaten groats, and " Food of Health," are remedies for constipation far better than all drugs. The value of fruits as food is shown in the table on page 7, but few people realize the fact that man is really a fruit-eating animal, as shown by his hands, his teeth, and his natiu-al tastes and appetites. A nation in Africa Hyes entirely on dates three months of every year. A man " sitting under his own vine and fig-tree" can live perfectly well upon their products. Figs contain the same proportion of nutriment as bread, and far more than any kind of flesh meat. We know men who have lived a long time, doing hard work, entii*ely on fruit. A friend of ours made a pedestrian tour of six weeks, walking over a large part of England, eatmg nothing but apples. On the last day he walked thirty miles, ^'^s none the worse, but rather the better, for his experiment.* Many persons supposed to be affected with incurable diseases have got well on a diet of fruit, or, as in the grape cure, on bread and fruit. BREAD AND PORRIDGE. Bread is the " Staff" of Life," because good bread contains all that is necessary for the nourishment of man. By good bread I mean that which contains all the elements of nutrition in the proportions required, which is pleasant to the taste, easy of digestion, and which favours the P™P«»' -jction of all the vital organs. I he best bread—one which affords perfect nourishment, and not only prevents but cures dyspepsia, constipation, and the many ailments they proauce--is made of the whole mml of wheat, from which nothing is separated, of which no element is thrown away. The most primitive read made of wheat crushed in a mortar or gi-ound between two stones, mixea up with water and baked on a broad leaf before the fire or in invnnf- "^''^ sweetest and healtliiest bread ever made.

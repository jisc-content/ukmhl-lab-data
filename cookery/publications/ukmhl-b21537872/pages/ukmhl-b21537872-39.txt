THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 33 a good colour you will keep the lid wholly or partially off the pot. The objection to this, where the kitchen is near the living-rooms, is that an unpleasant odour will pervade the house ; but this obnoxious element you may obviate by placing a lump of bread, the size of a French billiard ball, in a linen bag, and inserting it in the pot. It will absorb the gases which cause the disagreeable odour, and you will even pour away the water into the sink without further incon- venience. The linen bag being thoroughly washed will serve again. I think that if the cook would take advantage of rain-water, when it can be had, and adopt the above bread-bag, there will be little occasion to use soda.

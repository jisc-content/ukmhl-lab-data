3° THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. sole will demand the lower, heat. Yet practice alone can teach you this. Directly you have taken your fritto or fried food out of the fat, take care to remove the pan from the fire, otherwise the fat will burn. In describing the frying-pan, I have suggested that greater depth should be given them—say quite five inches —and the fat in it should be at least half that in depth for the frying of most things. Omelettes, pancakes, &c., are of course excepted. A good light by which to fry, as in the case of grilling, is a necessity. Sciuter means to toss. It is really to fiy lightly as opposed to frying in such a temperature that you obtain a roasting effect. You use less fat, and by tossing you pre- vent burning, and mitigate the heat. TO BOIL. (See also To Simmer.) As I have already said, the public are so accustomed to hear of boiled legs of mutton, &c., that I may be expected to treat of meat under this head. Inasmuch as meat will sometimes go through this to an infinitesimal degree, I will show you by the light of science what that infinitesimal degree is. Dr. Youmanssays:— “ In preparing meat for the table we shall discover it to be most desirable that the ingredients of its juice should remain in it, and this will depend much upon the methods of culinary procedure. If the piece of meat be intro- duced into the water when briskly boiling, the albumen at its surface, and to a certain depth inward, is immediately coagulated ; thus enclosing the mass in a crust or shell which neither permits its juice to flow out, nor the external water to penetrate within, to dissolve, dilute, and weaken it. The greater part of the sapid (palatable) constituents of 'the meat arc thus retained, rendering it juicy and well-

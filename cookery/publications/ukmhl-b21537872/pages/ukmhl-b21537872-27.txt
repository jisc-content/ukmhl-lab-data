THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 21 TO ROAST AND TO BAKE. (See again To Bake.) Strictly speaking, these two “ Principles ” should be separated and dealt with on their distinctive merits. But the extended introduction of kitcheners in place of the old open range have brought us in face of the fact that much food that was formerly roasted goes into the oven. Owing to the increased ventilation that is now given to the con- tents of the modern oven, a joint cooked in it does not present the decidedly baked flavour that obtained when the process first came into use. The economy and the cleanli- ness associated with the kitchener are so great, that no one would place the open range in comparison with it for other purposes than roasting. Yet it does not follow that I am to advise you to eschew roasting and commit your joint to the oven. No oven, I contend, has yet been constructed that will turn out a baked joint of meat equal in flavour to what the same joint would have had if cooked with the old- fashioned jack in front of the fire. “What are you to do?” will be your question. The answer is simple. Let the open fire of the kitchener have a larger surface-area, place in front of it thinner bars ‘than those ordinarily supplied, and effect the necessary economy in fuel by having a moveable grating in the fire-place, which may contract it when roasting is not to be performed. It is the condensed vapour in the oven, of which you cannot entirely get rid, that affects the fatty pait of a joint and causes it to be less crisp. A writer whom I have already quoted, Dr. Mitchell, of London and Paris, says on this subject of roasting, “ Even the boasted English roast is no longer what it was in the days when few households were without the pulley- jack and horizontal spit. The deterioration set in with the introduction of the bottle-jack and vertical roasting, and has been intensified by the kitchener with its stuffy empy-

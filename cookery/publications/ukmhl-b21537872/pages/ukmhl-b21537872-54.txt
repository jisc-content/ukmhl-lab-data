Julienne soup may be taken as the type of herbal soups, and therefore it illustrates a principle. A soup a la Jar- dinilre differs little from it, nor one a la Macedoine, and in spring you may call it a la Printanihe; with the onion and the cabbage, it becomes ct la Paysanne (the peasant wife’s soup), and with crusts of bread and the vegetables, somewhat less in number and cut more thickly, it becomes the croiite-au-pot. Vegetable purees, on the other hand, find a type, say, in the very well-known crecy (carrot soup), where you rub the cooked carrots through a sieve, and add such broth, &c., as the cookery book may advise. Parsnips, onions, Jerusalem artichokes, &c., may be treated in the same way, and each puree has its predominant flavour. Of meat or game purees hare soup is a type, and here again you make the animal or bird that gives the name present to you the special flavour. Broth for the Sick. Perfectly fresh meat, beef or chicken, cut up. Add il lb. of distilled (pure soft) water, with 4 drops muriatic acid, and ^ drachm of common salt. Mix the whole well together, and after standing an hour strain through hair sieve, letting it pass without pressing or squeezing. The first portion will be cloudy, so pour again through the sieve, and so on until clear. Upon residue in sieve pour y lb. distilled water. Do not heat and keep well cold to avoid fermentation.

57 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. slow stew going on ; above, the meat is in a sort of minia- ture oven baking and browning. It is a favourite mode of cooking with the French, and is supposed to create unusual flavour, combining the advantages of roasting and boiling. Whether it does so is another question. Braised meat is no doubt an improvement upon boiled, but it never reaches the flavour of a roast. This, however, is a matter of opinion ; and French cooks often put paper over delicate meat which is to be braised—say a fowl or turkey—to make sure that the heat of the brasier above will not give it too much of a taste.” {Dallas.) Mrs. Acton says that no attempt should be made to braise a joint in any vessel that is not, say, nearly of its own size. In consequence of charcoal being a common element in the French kitchen, braising is more easily effected there, and I do not dwell at very great length on the process, as I am convinced that it will never be a popular form of cooking with us. TO BASTE. “The rationale of basting,” says Mr. Mattieu Williams, F.C.S., “appears to be that it assists in the sealing, and diminishes the evaporation of the juices of the meat, the chief difference between well-roasted and ill-roasted meat depending upon this. I define the roasting and grilling of meat as processes of cookery by means of which the meat is stewed in its own juices. The flavour depends on this : no water being used, these juices are not diluted—they are, on the contraiy, more or less concentrated by evaporation ; but if this evaporation be carried too far, a drying-up occurs, and this desiccation, for reasons that will be ex- plained presently, is accompanied with toughness and in- digestibility, as well as sacrifice of flavour. “The smaller the joint, the greater the risk of such desic- cation.”

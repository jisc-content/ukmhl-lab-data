THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 20 hot, and hold it close to the preparation they wish to brown. Frying is a rather costly way of cooking fish, as it wastes the fat, which would make a sauce for them if boiled. However, the lard, if returned at once to the basin, may be used a second time. The grand secret, we may add, of successful frying is to have sufficient fat boiling, before the fish is placed in the frying-pan, to cover it. Butter is substituted for lard sometimes, but it does not improve the colour of the fish, and on the Continent oil is used, which is expensive. Clarified dripping is very good for this purpose. Fish should be cleaned by the fishmonger. To remove the earthy flavour which pond fish has, when the fish is carefully cleaned insert in place of the removed interior a piece of bread to fill the vacuum closely. This is removed after the fish is cooked. So long as you are in a large town, trussing is of no importance, as your poultryman will always truss any game you may have sent you. But should you be in a country district, or in the Highlands with friends about you shooting down game, it will be essential for you to know how to truss. The process is too long to describe here in all its branches, and so I will refer you to Mrs. Actonâ€™s book. Salted Meat. In what way salting injures meat, as it undoubtedly does, is not, I believe, known in a perfectly scientific manner, but as the most influential constituents of meat are dissolved in its juice, it may be taken that the salt abstracts the juice with its albumen, kreatine, and valuable salts ; for we find that the brine contains the chief soup-forming elements of meat.

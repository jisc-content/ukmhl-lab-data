THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 6 2 In England, tastes differ ; the tradition prefers flavours from the grocer to flavours from the garden, and the cook’s palate can rarely be trusted. Whilst nothing can be truer than the remark that sound healthy life, whether in the animal or vegetable kingdom, is quite inconsistent with the habitual use of a highly stimu- lating diet, it is at the same time necessary to study the pecu- liarities of those palates and digestions which have to be kept in healthy order, to consult idiosyncracies, and to humour whims as far as is possible. There is neither sense nor saving in using that against which the stomach is set. A remark by Dr. Brunton deserves to be quoted on this point :— “ Savoury food causes the digestive juices to be freely secreted; well cooked and palatable food is therefore more digestible than unpalatable, and if the food lack savour, a desire naturally arises to supply it by condiments, not always well selected or wholesome.” (Reeve.) Condiments. Among the simplest condiments which play so large a part in cookery may be mentioned salt, sugar, vinegar, or its equivalent, lemon or lime juice, and mustard. These are the poor man’s aids to the most ordinary forms of cooking or the preparation of food. It would be a happy thing if science could furnish us with oil at such a moderate price that we might include it among the poor man’s condiments. Certainly Nature does not, for even the richest household cannot purchase pure olive oil, and its adulteration more often takes the form of 95 per cent, of other oil. He who gets a so-called salad-oil with 40 per cent, of pure olive oil may consider himself lucky. You will remember the many uses of sugar in the matter of flavouring. It renders watery and insipid vegetables,* * About an ounce of white sugar to two gallons of water is not without its advantage, particularly in winter, when vegetables have less saccharine matter.

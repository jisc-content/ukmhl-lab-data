53 fHE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. with a Milanaise sauce (in which Parmesan appears), he might think that your views on the flavour of cheese were monotonous. Hold, if possible, to this leading principle in devising a dinner, that the sauces that may form part in it must be diverse, and that no guest shall be able to recall a flavour already observed at the same repast. You may with advantage follow the French in dividing your sauces into white and brown, and you will afterwards subdivide them. The French call their brown sauce Espagnole, because at one time Spanish tastes prevailed, and introduced the Montanche hams into their old brown sauce. Their white they call Velouti\ and from these spring divers others. These so-called white may be yellow (yolk of egg) or red (tomato) ; they are still white sauces in the language of the kitchen, being based on decoction—sometimes a very long decoction. The difference between white and brown sauces is wholly a question of roasting (see effect of roasting coffee under the verb “To Roast”). Why this should be can be deter- mined by oiling one piece of butter and roasting the other. The roasted butter will present to you a fragrance which has hitherto been hidden. I use the word roasting here in the sense that we roast coffee. White sauces are the result of decoction, and no other heating process. We should never have heard of sauce a lEspagnole but for the existence of Spanish hams ; and, so long as you introduce highly smoked ham into your brown sauce, you may call it Spanish, but not otherwise. Dallas says : “ The introduction of the Spanish ham into the stock-pot for brown sauce is but one of many ways of getting the taste of the fire. Ham has been smoked, and a certain vapour of creosote and pyroligneous acid has been incorporated with it. The roast flavour which through the Spanish ham is supposed to improve a brown sauce is a modification of charred pinewood. Knowing this, we can rate at its

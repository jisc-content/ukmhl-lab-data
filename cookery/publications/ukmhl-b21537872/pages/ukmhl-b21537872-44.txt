THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 38 Count Rumford illustrates by a story the advantages of moderate heat in cooking fish. “ In the seaport towns of the New England States in North America it has been a custom, time immemorial, among people of fashion to dine one day in the week (Saturday) on salt fish; and a long habit of preparing the same dish has, as might have been expected, led to very considerable improvements in the art of cooking it. I have often heard foreigners, who have assisted at these dinners, declare that they never tasted salt fish dressed in such perfection ; and I well remember that the secret of cooking it is to keep it a great many hours in water that is just scalding hot, but which is never made actually to boil.” It is not always necessary that you should boil or simmer your food in plain salt and water. There are methods, too little understood with us, by which you obtain delicate fragrance by using a very cheap liquor. Such is what the French call “ Court-Bouillon.” To give this an English name, I will call it “ flavoured water-broth,” meaning that it is something more than water, and yet without meat In effect, it is water to which you have added some vinegar, carrots, onions, parsley (whole), thyme, laurel, salt and pepper, and, after boiling the whole together, you use it—say to boil salmon. Insensibly the salmon will get a certain indefinite (the ignorant, without palate or nose, will say very indefinite) flavour, which will please the educated. Ude, the great French chef, had special varieties of Court-Bouillon made with wine ; but I do not think I shall add anything to the principle involved in the use of such a liquor by enlarging further on it. You must now go tc the Cookery Book.

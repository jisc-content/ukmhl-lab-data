39 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. TO STEW. Soups. Meat is composed of fibre, fat, gelatine, osmazone, and albumen. In making stock you will remove the scum (fat and albumen) as they rise to the surface. You will find more osmazone in old than in young animals, more in brown than in white meats. It is this element which makes your stock fragrant. Albumen is of the nature of white of eggs. You may dissolve it in cold or tepid water, but it will coagulate in water at boiling or a little under boiling-point (212° Fahr.). If you put meat in a stock-pot with the water boiling, you will form a crust or shell outside the meat, and prevent the gelatine and osmazone from dissolving. Result—a poor stock. Bones are important in the stock-pot, as they contain, weight for weight, eight times the gelatine in meat. You should break them. Gelatine has no taste, and only in conjunction with osmazone affords a savoury stock. Illustrating, then, by this verb the utensils named in their place—viz. stock-pot, pipkin, stewpan, &c.—I at once borrow from the recent Cantor lecture by Mr. Mattieu Williams, F.C.S., because nothing that I can say (with an exception that will be seen in a footnote) can better describe what the process of stewing is, and how deplorably deficient we are in it. “ The prevailing idea in England is that stewed meat only differs from boiled meat by being kept in the water for a longer time—that stewing is simply protracted boiling. I venture, nevertheless, to declare the total fallacy of this, and to assert that, so far as flesh food is concerned, boiling and stewing are diametrically opposite, as regards the special objects to be attained. In boiling a joint—say, a leg of mutton—the best efforts of the cook should be directed to retaining the juices within the meat, and allowing the smallest possible quantity to come out into the water. In stewing, the business is to get as much

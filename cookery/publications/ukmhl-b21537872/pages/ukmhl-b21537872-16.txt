IO THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. should always be fit for use several times. This will be more fully enlarged on when we come to the process of frying. There should be in every kitchen a fish frying-pan, with drainer or wire lining, by which you can take out your fish without risk of breaking it. This frying-pan should be 5 or 6 inches deep. For omelettes, &c., a special pan is better. Dr. Mitchell complains that the sides of our frying-pans are too perpendicular, and not convenient for making an omelette. I did not think that that was one of their faults, but rather want of depth. Doubtless, for omelette-making you want a special frying-pan. But even here the cook’s skill in making the omelette mixture has as much to do with the result. Sauce or Stew Pans (Verbs—To simmer, to stew, and sometimes to boil). If you can possibly afford it (and, owing to the fall in the value of the metal, they have lessened in price), you should always have copper stewpans, as well as other sauce- pans, in your kitchen. Three, varying from a pint to two quarts, will satisfy the wants of a modest household. These stewpans are tin-lined, and require at various periods, according to their service, to be re-tinned. Otherwise very serious results, in the form of poisoning, may result. Iron saucepans, lined with enamel, or simply tinned, are chiefly of use where the food you cook in them is to be subject to absolute boiling. Such is the case with the plain potato or other vegetable, or, say, puddings ; but when you have simmering to do, appeal to your copper pan to aid you. Or, again, have a double saucepan, similar in principle to a bain-marie, where a small sauce- pan, lined with enamel, fits into a larger one, in which you have the water. Under the verb “to stew,” you will see where the utility of this may be found.

THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 58 TO BROWN AND CLARIFY. Soyer says—“When in business and not so much time devote to the kitchen, I used to make shift with a browning made thus, but I must add that I use a very few drops of it :—Put two ounces of powdered sugar into a middling- sized stew-pan, which place over a slow fire ; when begin- ning to melt, stir it round with a wooden spoon until getting quite black, then pour over it half a pint of cold water ; leave it to dissolve, and take a little for use when required. Burnt onions are used in France for this pur- pose.” The above is another form of caramel, which is made by browning pounded lump sugar in a stew-pan over the fire with a little broth, taking care it does not burn. It is used to colour sauces and gravies, and may be kept in a jar handy for use. The salamander is the proper mode for browning, say, macaroni, etc. When you have not this utensil do it in front of a clear fire with any kind of tin reflector. Clarifying is effected (ist) by skimming, (2nd) by white of egg or cold water, and sometimes by raw meat. For clarifying fat, see the observations under frying-pan (utensils). TO FLAVOUR. In defining the principles involved in the application of this verb, we may be said to quit science, and confine our- selves to the teachings of art, that will only produce happy results, as with a picture or piece of sculpture, when Tech- nical Knowledge is combined with Taste. In most, but not all cases, flavouring comes before cook- ing, and the technical knowledge is applied when the food is before you in a raw state, but even if you have succeeded in proportions you may afterwards spoil everything by

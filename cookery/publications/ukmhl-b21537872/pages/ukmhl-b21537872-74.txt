THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 68 2. Heat for dish, cover, and platter where food is hot; cold, and not merely lukewarm, plates or dishes where the food is cold. The taste which you may display in the form of your food, or the decoration which may be thought agreeable to apply to it, are quite beside “Principles.” They are adjuncts, and most useful adjuncts, where labour, which means time and money, is at your disposal; but they are not necessaries, and I have endeavoured to insist only here on such principles as are equally demanded in the cottage as in the palace.

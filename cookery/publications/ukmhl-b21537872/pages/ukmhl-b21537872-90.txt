P-4 THE PRINCIPLES 01 COOKING. been, I should have prefaced any suggestions I might have had to make by the words I used elsewhere, when a wider latitude was allowed me in criticising the views of others. I said then, as I say now, “we must readily admit that there is no infallibility in dogmas directed against other people’s stomachs.” But in saying this, I am not prevented from pointing out those cases where a people (our people) have been led away from correct taste by the bountiful provision of fuel which Nature has given us. It is not too much to say that with coal at five pounds a ton, cookery could never have fallen to the low ebb which the School of Cookery has been established to correct. In France first, and in Italy afterwards, where waste in fuel means ruin to a household, dishes are cooked by the humblest which you would gratefully seize if they appeared on the menu of the best club in London. I mean by this that Fire, although an essential, may be very badly and foolishly used, and that the very diffi- culties in the way of those who have had to pay dearly for it, have assisted in creating the greatest national school of cookery that has ever existed. I speak of France. I will not permit it to be said that I am advocating all tUe results that flow from that indigenous school, but I maintain that the processes it employs—that are employed throughout France among the lower middle-classes—in- volve a quality of food and economy that are not obtained in our cottages ; and until a pot-au-feu, or its equivalent, is an institution with us, we shall not know what it is to have a national dish. Finally, let the cook be modest, and with that he or she will have a greater chance to obtain the inspiration of GENIUS.

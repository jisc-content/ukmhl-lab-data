degree of heat much inferior to what bread is exposed to in the oven, may be satis- factorily proved by attending to the common process of making paste. If a table spoonful of fine flour be carefully mixed with half a pint of cold water, and brought to a degree of heat a little under that of boiling water, and kept at the same for about ten minutes, being careful that it does not quite boil, it will be converted into a tenacious adhesive paste : But, if suffered to boil briskly for the same length of time, its adhesive properties will be destroyed; and, on cooling, the flower will separate from the water, and subside. Those who are in the habits of using paste know that it is tenacious in proportion to the f goodness of the flower from which it is pre- i: pared; and that to inferior kinds alum j must be added, with the same intention that 4 the baker mixes this ingredient with bad :t flower, to augment its tenacity, by which the | sponge rises the better, not as is commonyB supposed, to render it more white. A knowledge of this fact, that the gluteil j( of wheat is destroyed by exposure to ami degree of heat superior to that of boiling pi water, is subservient to other important pur! i poses in the occonomy of grain.

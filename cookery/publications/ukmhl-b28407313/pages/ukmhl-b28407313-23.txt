( 13 ) writer has occasionally mixed with the crouds in waiting for soup—He has seen, with feel- ings which it is unnecessary to express here, the just abhorrence that some, who, perhaps, had seen better days, appeared to feel at being obliged to associate with the common beggar. And next to that, his ears have been shocked at the wrangling, the swearing, the obscenity, and the uproar of the croud arround him. In such assemblies, people do not fail to compare their grievances; and by comparing aggravate them. If the establishments for the distribution of soup are liable to these objections, surely they ought not to be rendered permanent. If they be, they will convert the majority of the labouring class of people of this metro- polis into paupers, who will expect their winter provision of victuals, as regularly as the populace of Rome did their monthly dis- tribution of corn; and they will, like them too, become clamorous and seditious if it be withheld. Want is the result of idleness, and idleness is fostered by misapplied charity. A tax to support the eleemosynary distribu- tion of soup will become, as has been admirably said of the poor laws, — “a bounty “ on idleness, and a duty upon industry.”

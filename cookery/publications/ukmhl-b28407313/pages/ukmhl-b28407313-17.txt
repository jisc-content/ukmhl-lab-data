The diminution of the production of corn, is farther aug- mented, by the greater expence, trouble, and risk, connected with agriculture, com- pared with what appertains to pasturage, as well as by the direct operation of tythes. If the great quantity of vegetable food that must be condensed into the body of an ox, before he become fit for the food of man, be duly considered, it will be evident, that nothing can be gained in point of ceconomy, ! by eating even the coarsest pieces of meat ; made into soup, of such strength as to afford any nourishment, compared with farinaceous > food.

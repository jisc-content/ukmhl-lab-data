â€¢ ( 16 ) That Tea is an expensive diet, will not, probably, be denied. At the present price of the necessaries of life, it can hardly be esti- mated at less than six-pence per head each time it is taken; and none but those whose professional duty leads them to visit the abodes of the working classes of people in- habiting this town, can imagine how fre- quently it is substituted for dinner, by those whose circumstances could well afford a bet- ter meal, merely from the facility with which it is procured. However custom may have habituated every class of people in this country to the use of tea, within this last half century, it will hardly be seriously contended, that it deserves to be considered as a necessary of life. The infusion of tea alone, affords no nourishment. Considered medicinally, as a slightly aromatic bitter, it must be allowed rather to encrease the digestive action of the stomach, and augment appetite, than to satisfy hunger. With this view indeed it is made use of, by those who overload their stomachs with too much victuals. But this property of encreasing appetite, must render it an article of diet highly improper tor those, ^yho can with difficulty obtain food.

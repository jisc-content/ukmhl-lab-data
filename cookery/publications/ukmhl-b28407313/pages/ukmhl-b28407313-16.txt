animal, it is not capable of being coagulated by the coagulating juice of the stomach, and does not give nearly that quantity of nourish- ment, which it gives if employed in a solid form, without being previously dissolved in water. So, in like manner, the white of an egg exhibited in a fluid state, as it is found in the egg, gives great nourishment, bemg coagulable, and becoming solid in the sto- mach. But, if the same white of egg be co- agulated by heat, and boiled or digested in Papin's digester, and so dissolved in water and exhibited, it does not now coagulate from the coagulating juice of the stomach, and does not yield nearly the same quantity of nourishment. ‚Äù Hence we learn that it is absolutely requi- site to eat a certain quantity of bread along with soup, in order to obtain any degree of nourishment from it. But the general use of soup will be found in another point of view, not only to aug- ment the consumption of bread, but to di- minish its production. The basis of all soup is animal matter, commonly beef. It has been ascertained, by calculation, that four times the quantity of ground is required to support an ox that is necessary to maintain a

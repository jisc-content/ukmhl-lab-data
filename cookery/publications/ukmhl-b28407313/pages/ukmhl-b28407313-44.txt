( 34 ) stituent parts of the flower being carried away with the water. From its adhesiveness and tenacity this matter has been termed Gluten, and it is possessed of several peculiar properties. When burned it smells like horn or leather; and when exposed to moisture it runs into the putrid, not the acetous fer- mentation ; in both these respects partici- pating of the nature of animal, rather than vegetable matter. Of this Gluten wheat contains a much larger proportion than any other species of grain produced in this coun- try: the quantity and quality of which in proportion to the other constituent parts, is the best test of its goodness. In sound wheat it abounds, and may be drawn out into thin laminae, or long strings, eminently elastic; and in proportion as the grain has been heat- ed, or spoiled, the gluten is more friable, ast well as more difficult to obtain in a separate state. In this material all the principal nu-j tritious properties of wheat are contained; foil the nutritive powers of the amylaceous part) or starch are comparatively trifling. From the peculiar abundance in which this gluterj is found in wheat, mankind have adoptecjl that grain as the general basis of vegetable:; aliment, in preference to all others, in ever>

( 26 ) At the beginning of the present centurv tea was hut little known in this country. At that time the annual import did not ex- ceed a hundred thousand pounds. Nor can it be considered as a general article of diet till after the middle of it, when the quantity annually imported exceeded two millions of pounds. In the year 1777, the importation was upwards of sixteen millions ; and, from the most authentic documents, the present annual importation is supposed not to he less than thirty millions ! Can it be doubted that a new article of diet could be adopted to such an astonishing extent, without pro- ducing some adequate change on the consti- tutions of the consumers of it ? In a period of thirty years, reckoning from 1717 when the use of tea was yet un-j common, palsy encreased nearly in the ratio* of two to one. In the next fifteen years when tea-drinking was generally diffused^ j especially in the capital, the ratio of this i disease augments as three to one, and con-* ^ tinues nearly the same during the forty-fivd | sons not necessary to detail here. Since that time, it i taken from the annual bills of mortality, and a periods of equal length compared.

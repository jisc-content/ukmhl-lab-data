( 14 ) PART ir. A PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE CONSUMP- TION OF FINE WHEATEN BREAD PROVED TO BE THE USE OF TEA. Whatever may be the real cause of the present high prce of bread corn, it is generally admitted that there are only two Ways of obviating the evil—By bringing a greater quantity of the material to market; or by diminishing the consumption to lessen the demand. To encrease our stock, by means calculated to induce other nations to part with such portion of theirs as they can spare, is the proper business of the legisla- ture, and will no doubt be attended to.— To oeconomize what we possess is perhaps a more difficult, but certainly a more effec- tual plan, and entirely dependent on the efforts of individuals. In order, however, to practice it with efficacy, it is necessary to be aware of the mode in which the greatest quantity of bread is at present consumed.

(15) Among the various means which have been proposed to (economize the consumption of bread, it is truly surprizing that the intimate connection between the encreased consump- tion of it, and the very prevalent use of tea as a part of diet, has attracted so small a share of attention. By all classes of people tea is used twice a day; and, by too many of our sedentary artificers, even three times. Its perpetual concomitant is bread, with the addition of butter, if it can be procured. The momentary hilarity of spirits produced by this fascinating beverage, is one cause of its being so generally agreeable. Another is, that the facility with which a meal of this kind is procured coincides powerfully with that spirit of indolence to which human nature in all situations is but too prone. To procure a meal of tea and its appendages, the sole active exertion required, is to make the kettle boil. The tea, the sugar, the bread and butter, and the milk, are all to be found ready prepared, for money or credit. The distribution of ready made soup tends to foster this. spirit of idleness, while at the same time it enables the poor to expend a gicatei portion of their earnings on this dear and darling luxury.

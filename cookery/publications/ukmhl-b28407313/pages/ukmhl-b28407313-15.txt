Fordyce, in his truly philosophical Treatise on Digestion, has informed us, in order that the process of digestion may be properly carried on, it is requisite that the food should remain during a certain time in the stomach. To effect this purpose, nature has provided in the stomach of all animals a certain material termed gastric juice; which has the property of coagulating, or rendering solid, every substance capable of affording nourishment. Even milk, or the white of an egg, substances eminently nutritious, when received into the stomach, are imme- diately converted into solids: but, to use the Doctor's own words— “ It farther appears from experiment, that food dissolved in Avater, so as to form a solution not capable of being coagulated, and not detained by intermixture Avith solid mat- ter, gives very little nourishment, in propor- tion to the same quantity of the same food given in a solid form, or a coagulable one. Thus, for example : if a solid piece of flesh, be dissolved in Avater by simple boiling, or by Papin’s digester, and exhibited to an

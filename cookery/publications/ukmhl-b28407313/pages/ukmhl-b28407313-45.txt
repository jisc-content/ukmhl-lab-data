In proportion therefore as the flower is more finely sifted or bolted; or, as the millers term it, higher dressed, the greater quantity of this gluten does it contain. But this matter is of too adhesive and tenaceous a nature, to undergo the process of digestion with facility, when taken into the stomach alone. For this reason, fine flower when eaten after being merely boiled, as in the form of dumplins, in many people produces the sensation of heaviness, or indigestion, and partly also because the stomach is op- pressed by too great a quantity of nutritious matter. With a view to counteract these effects, fine flower is made to undergo the process of baking. This operation consists in the first place in separating the parts of this glutinous matter by fermentation, and then farther destroying its adhesive properties by exposure to a certain degree of heat. In the same proportion as the operation of baking tends to facilitate the digestion of fine flower, it operates, by destroying the gluten, to diminish the nourishment origi- nally contained it. And though fine, friable, well-baked bread is a very agreeable species

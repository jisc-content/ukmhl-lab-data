SALSIFY AU GRATIN. 131 tender take out the ftauftieltcs, lay them in a pyramid on a very hot silver dish, and cover closely. Strain off the broth, add a gill of tomato sauce or conserve, and pass it into a stewpan in which a roux of half an ounce of butter and half one of flour has been prepared to receive it. Bring this to the boil, skim, pass it through a pointed strainer over the fiaufiiettes, and serve, garnishing with turned potatoes arranged in a chain round the outer edge. 3. Scorsonera—the black salsify—is a better vege- table than the white, but is not so easily got. This dish is designed for the latter. Half a bundle will be enough. Choose nice falsify an pieces, wash, scrape, and trim them an & equal length, cutting off the thin ends, and casting them into cold water in which a dessert-spoonful of vinegar has been mixed. Have ready on the fire in a stewpan a pint of uncoloured broth, or milk and water in half and half proportions, and half an ounce of butter ; bring this to the boil, slip in the salsify, partly cover the pan, and simmer till the vegetable is tender ; then drain it, arrange the pieces neatly on a flat gratin-dish, thicken half a pint of the caisson, add a dessert-spoonful of cream, mask the salsify with it, strew grated Parmesan over the surface, and set the dish in the oven till heated and coloured, serving with a garnish of croutons or biscuits of savoury short-paste, No. 4, Menu iv. N.B.—In the case of black salsify cook the roots without cutting and peeling, reserving trimming until afterwards, when they are cold.

BLANQUETTE OF VEAL A LA CITOYENNE. 59 (No. 1, Menu iii.), garnish with sippets of nicely fried bread, and serve. 2. A pound and a half of cold roast veal, not over- cooked in the first instance, will do for this. Cut the meat into thickish slices, trim these neatly (all trimmings will come in for a mince on Blanquette another occasion), dust them over with ttoytnnt flour, and let them remain on a dish while you prepare a sauce to receive them. At the bottom of a stewpan put half an ounce of butter, set over a low fire, and stir in half an ounce of flour, and when well mixed moisten with half a pint of good veal or chicken broth, which may have been made from bones, trimmings, or giblets. To this when it comes to the boil add the stalks and peelings of a quarter of pound of mushrooms, and such seasoning of salt and white pepper as may be necessary. Simmer for fifteen minutes, stirring and skimming off all scum, and then pass the sauce through a hair sieve. Return it to the washed-out stewpan, mix with it a gill of tomato sauce, put in the pieces of veal, and keep over a very low fire until sufficiently hot to serve, carefully avoiding boil- ing. Serve within a circle of mashed potato, and gar- nish the surface with the mushrooms which supplied the peelings, nicely broiled, and little rolls of bacon. 3. Boil four ounces of rice as already described, drain it, and empty it into a bowl ; stir into it two whole eggs and two yolks that have been beaten up in a gill of warm milk, set this in hot water over

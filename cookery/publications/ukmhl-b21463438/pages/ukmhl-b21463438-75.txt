MENU XX. (May.) Coquilles de poisson froid. Croquettes de bceuf a la Viennoise. Pots de creme au caf& Escalopes de foie gras au madere. r. Almost any cold cooked fish can be used in this manner, or even mixed fish, such as salmon and whiting, sole and shrimps, or turbot and lobster, enough only being required to fill, ^lsfish in say, six china scallop shells after making an allowance for the other materials. Cut up the fish in small pieces, and add to it one-third of its bulk of cold cooked mushroom cut into small squares, and for six shells a dessert-spoonful of minced pickled gherkins ; put all into a bowl, and moisten it with a tablespoonful of salad oil and a teaspoonful of tarra- gon vinegar, seasoning with pepper and salt; leave it thus marinading for a quarter of an hour. Take the mixed mince now out of the bowl, and in another one dress it with mayonnaise sauce ; next fill the scallop shells with the mince, trimming it in a dome, and masking the surface with mayonnaise; decorate the outside of the dome with strips of anchovies crumbled white and yolk of egg, and garden cress loosely shaken over all. Serve on a flat dish sur- rounded with watercress. 07

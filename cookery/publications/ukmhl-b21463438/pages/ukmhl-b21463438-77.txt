BROWN CHAUD-FROID GLAZE. 69 whipped cream sweetened and flavoured with vanilla in a glass dish. 4. The smallest sized pate de foie gras will do for this. Open the tin or lerrine, as the case may be, melt the fat round the pate, and pour it off ; with a very sharp knife cut the pate Escalopes of into slices a quarter-inch thick ; trim and 2™* lay these out on a flat dish, mask them on their upper sides only with brown chaud-froid glaze flavoured with madeira, and when this has set lift them with a slice, arrange them round a small block of fried bread, fill the space round them with broken aspic, and send dry toast round separately. Brown chaud-froid glaze :—Put half a pint of plain brown sauce on the fire ; see that the colour is good —a rich brown ; a few drops of caramel will give this; stir in a quarter of an ounce B>'°wn of soaked gelatine, dissolve this over a fazt^ moderate fire, skimming off all scum;& lastly add a dessert-spoonful of marsala, which in cooking may be substituted for madeira. Pour into a basin. As this cools it will gradually set, and the masking should be done the moment the consistency is such as to coat the spoon well when dipped into it; it should flow without lumps as honey or treacle does. If the dish with the escalopes be set over crushed ice the setting will be much more rapid. Trim off the portions of glaze which may have over- flowed the edges, and slip the slice under the esca- lopes to dish them.

Soups were so fully described in " Fifty Dinners" that I have not included them in the suggestions now pre- sented, and as in the case of that little treatise I have left to the taste and judgment of my various readers the alternative of adding a joint of meat or cold piece to their bill of fare if necessary. Out-of-door luncheons at cricket matches, picnics, boating parties, and race meetings are specialites in their way which I have not touched upon, neither have I said anything about the contents of the sports- man's basket. The subject may perhaps form an excuse for another little book. But givers of luncheon parties within doors ought to find, I think, some little assistance in " Fifty Lunches." Just one word of advice. Let the menu for such gatherings be as short as possible. Nothing in the way of entertain- ment is less enjoyable than an over-wrought midday meal, dragging its slow length along till the afternoon is almost spent. If the day happen to be warm, and the room at all full, the discussion of a series of good things becomes exceedingly trying to many people, a reunion which should be as light in its effect as possible waxes dull and heavy, and thus the most hospitable intentions are not appreciated.

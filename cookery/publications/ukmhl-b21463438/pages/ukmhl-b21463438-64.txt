The spinach, separately dished, should be cooked in this manner :—Pick the leaves carefully, rejecting all that are bruised and discoloured, wash them very care- fully, drain and plunge them for five minutes into boiling salted water, using plenty of it, and a roomy non-tinned vessel. The moment that the five minutes expire take the pan off the fire, drain the spinach on a large sieve, and refresh it with a good douche of cold water. Press out all moisture, turn the spinach out upon a board and chop it up, then put it into a casserole with two ounces of butter melted and hot, season with pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace, and stir it over a moderate fire for ten minutes without leaving it, thus absorbing all moisture, and finish with two tablespoonfuls of cream or good white sauce. If a stiff consistency be de- sired half an ounce of flour may be mixed with the butter in the second stage of the work. These proportions are worked out for two pounds of spinach.

October, 1S96. MR. EDWARD ARNOLD'S London: 37 BEDFORD STREET. New York: 70 FIFTH AVENUE. THE ADVENTURES OF MY LIFE. By HENRI ROCHEFORT. The authorised English edition, revised and specially arranged by M. ROCHEFORT, and translated under his personal supervision by E. W. Smith, editor of the Daily Messenger in Paris. In two volumes, large crown 8vo., 25s. In this work M. Henri Rochefort tells the amazing story of his adventurous life. Among the more important episodes are the author's personal naira- tive of the French Commune, his subsequent transportation to the pei.al settlement of New Caledonia, his marvellous escape, his numerous duels, his residence in England, and his deeply interesting journalistic ventures. The work is appearing in five volumes in French, but M. Rochefort has decided to prepare a special and, in many respects, original version in English for sale in this country ; he has reduced the bulk of the work to two handy volumes, by omitting much that is of purely local interest, and select- ing only such of his adventures as will appeal to English-speaking readers. Apart from the value of the matter, the brilliance of M. Rochefurt's style is notorious, and his strong personality penetrates every page of the work. The translation is being undertaken in Paris by Mr. E. W. Smith, editor of the Daily Messenger, in daily communication with the author.

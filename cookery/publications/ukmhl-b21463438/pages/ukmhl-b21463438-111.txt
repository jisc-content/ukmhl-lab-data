Take the remains from a brace of cold grouse, from four to six ounces enough, free this from skin and sinew and pass it through a mincing machine; with the bones, skin, &c, make Buttered a strong broth as explained for the hare fam7.tH cutlets in Menu i. Thicken and reduce this; as soon as it is ready put in the mince (the con- sistency being about as thick as jam) and heat it gently in the bain-marie. Have ready six well-fried croutes of bread three inches long, two broad, and a quarter thick ; keep them hot in the mouth of the oven. Make now ceufs brouilles (see No. i, Menu iii.) with five eggs and three ounces of butter, and the moment they are ready spread the croutes over with the grouse mince ; arrange them on a hot silver dish, mask them with the buttered eggs, scatter finely grated ham over all, and serve. Everything depends upon the excellence of the essence produced from the game bones and the rapidity of serving the moment the buttered eggs are done. Practicable with any kind of game.

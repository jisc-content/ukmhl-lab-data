MENU XVII. 58 (May.) CEufs brouilles aux asperges. Blanquette de veau a la citoyenne. Beignets de riz. Boudins a la Napolitaine. i. A small bundle of asparagus will meet the requirements of this dish. Untie the bundle, wash the vegetable, and cut the tender green Buttered ends into quarter-inch lengths ; set these edPs with asparagus, aside ; slice up the stalks into strips, put them into a stewpan, cover them with cold milk and water in half-and-half proportions, season with salt, set over a moderate fire, and bring to the boil ; simmer then till as soft as you can get them, after which turn the contents of the pan out upon a hair sieve, pressing as much pulp as you can with the liquid through it. Next with half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour make over a iow fire a roux at the bottom of the rinsed-out stewpan, moisten with half a pint of the boilings, and bring to the boil, skim, and add the cut-up green ends ; simmer these for twelve minutes, or until they are tender (the time will depend on the fresh- ness, size, and natural tenderness of the asparagus), and when ready pour the whole into a hot legumicre, arrange over the surface a canopy of buttered eggs

MARMALADE OF APPLES. 159 having been done, stir into it two tablespoonfuls of apricot jam and a liqueur-glass of kirsch, maras- chino, or any nice liqueur ; set this in the stewpan again, and reduce it over the fire, stirring continually until it becomes a stiff puree or marmalade. When this condition has been reached let it cool, and when cold arrange the puree in a dish in a dome-shape, using a palette-knife dipped in hot water to smooth its surface ; powder over then with finely sifted sugar, and garnish round with croutes of stale madeira cake which have been lightly fried in butter, cooled, and dusted with sugar. If liked, the surface of the sugar coating the dome may be glazed with a sala- mander or glazing-iron. 1

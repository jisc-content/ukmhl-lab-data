When the liquid boils freely throw in the dry rice ; maintain the high temperature, stirring now and then with a wooden spoon. Watch the clock, and after ten minutes' boiling begin to test the grains by taking a few out with the spoon and pinching them between the linger and thumb. In twelve or fourteen minutes they ought to be quite tender without pulpiness, the exact time depending upon the size of the grains. When this stage has been reached boiling should be immediately stopped by the throwing in of half a pint or so of cold water. Lift the pan from the fire, empty its contents on a wire sieve, drain off all the water, returning the cooked rice to the hot dry vessel in which it was boiled. Put in a quarter of an ounce of butter to detach grains that may stick to the side of the pan, and work the rice about with a two-pronged steel fork. Shake well, cover with a hot folded napkin (not the lid), and set the pan in front of the fire, or on the most moderate part of the hot-plate upon a " safe-boiling stove mat," giving it a shake every now and then.

Salt cod can often be procured from the fish- monger very partially salted, and only requiring a short period of soaking. Ordinary salt cod should be steeped in tepid water for Salt coci six hours, and in cold for six hours, the water in each case being changed four times. To dress after soaking, put the fish into cold water, and bring to the boil, simmer immediately for five minutes and it will be done. To serve (say two pounds) boil, drain, and mash two pounds of potatoes, moistening with two ounces of butter and a gill of the cod-boilings ; get the puree smooth and creamy by passing it through a wire sieve, finish with a tablespoonful of cream and two of grated Parmesan. This should not be nearly as stiff as mashed potatoes in the English way. With it make a bed upon a very hot dish, lay the cod upon it, and mask the whole with hard-boiled egg sauce, the moistening of which should be the fish-boilings. The dish is im- proved if one-third of the liquid used for cooking the cod be milk.

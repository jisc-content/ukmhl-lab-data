i44 FIFTY LUNCHES. Simmer now for an hour over a low fire, remove the pan, and when the rice is cool, having absorbed nearly the whole of the milk, break into it two whole eggs, mix well, and spread it out upon a dish to a thickness of an inch and a half. When cold and firm cut the mass into pieces an inch wide and one and a half long. Strew a pastry board over with crumbled ratafias that have been grated, or pounded and sifted ; put the portions of rice upon this bed, and roll them in cork shapes, then dip them in well- beaten egg and crumb them with the same crumbs. Fry when quite dry in a deep bath of boiling fat till a golden colour, and drain afterwards on a wire drainer laid on a sheet of brown paper in front of the fire ; then dust them liberally with sifted sugar, and serve with hot apricot syrup sauce, flavoured with rum and lemon. An easy luncheon dish if the rice be prepared the day before or very early in the morning, to allow of its getting cold.

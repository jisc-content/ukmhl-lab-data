BROAD BEANS A LA POULETTE. 99 bain-marie for fear of the egg curdling, and serve in a legumiere, with the biscuits mentioned for No. 4, Menu vi. Scatter finely minced chervil over the surface of the beans to finish with. 4. For a pint and a half mould take two and a half gills of milk, three whole eggs and two yolks, two tablespoonfuls of ginger syrup, and the zest of a lemon or orange. Boil the milk, and as it cools beat the syrup and eggs together in a bowl, then add the milk and zest and turn the mixture to a custard over another vessel containing boiling water. Butter a plain charlotte-mould, line it with buttered paper, ornament the top with a pattern cut out of preserved ginger, and make a fine mince of all the trimmings and as much more of the preserve as may be required to yield four tablespoonfuls. Stir this into the custard, fill the mould with the latter and steam it gently until firm—about forty-five to fifty minutes—then turn out and serve with a syrup flavoured with ginger and lemon-juice. Equally nice cold with a cold syrup.

Set this over the fire to simmer, flavour with a liqueur-glass of kirsch, then slip in the apples neatly pared and quartered. Cook gently till the pieces of apples are clone, stopping before they break or become pulpy ; drain them with a perforated spoon from the syrup, and lay them on a glass compote-dish. Now put into the syrup two tablespoonfuls of apricot jam, another liqueur-glass of kirsch, a teaspoonful of cornflour, or crane de rig, and the juice of a lemon ; bring to the boil, and stir continually till the consistency attains that of thin treacle, after which cool, and strain it over the pieces of apple ; let the dish become as cold as possible, and serve. Whipped cream may of course be laid over the apples, or cream may be handed separately, accord- ing to taste. 4 For this little savoury make a cheese cream (see No. 4, Menu iv.), and fill nine little darioles with it by degrees, setting in each danole, Creams with aiso by degrees, as much minced picked 5E2SJ* la Crimps as the cream will dilute nicely. Let the moulds become firm, then turn them out, dish tastefully, and serve.

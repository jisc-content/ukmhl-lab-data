MENU XL. 133 (October.') Loup-de-mer a la Dubois. Noisettes de lapin au celeri. Pommes en surprise. Darioles a la Calaisienne i. About a pound and a half of hake having been procured in slices not more than half an inch thick, lay them upon a joint dish, season them with salt, pour two tablespoonfuls of salad Hake with oil over them, add the juice of a lemon, 'ZZ'™^ cover with coarsely chopped parsley, and let them lie in this marinade half an hour ; then turn them, continuing the process another half hour. Now lift the slices, drain, and dry them on a cloth, flour them, brush them over with an egg beaten up with a teaspoonful of the marinade, and then turn them over upon a cloth containing a couple of breakfast-cupfuls of finely sifted oven-dried crumbs. Let the crumbing dry well before proceeding to fry the fish, which must of course be done piece by piece in boiling fat deep enough to cover them. Serve with this sauce :— Put a coffee-cupful of horse-radish raspings into half a pint of milk, boil up, season with salt, and simmer ten minutes; then strain the milk into a bowl, stir two eggs into it, and turn it to a custard over a vessel containing boiling water ; finish with a teaspoonful Ox reduced vinegar.

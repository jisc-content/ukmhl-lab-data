FIFTY LUNCHES. 72 the fire low, stirring to prevent catching, and season- ing with salt, pepper, mace, and finely powdered basil. When the tomatoes have been cooked to a pulp mix in with them three-quarters of an ounce of soaked gelatine, and keep this well stirred until it is thoroughly dissolved. Now pass the whole through a hair sieve, putting the liquid that comes through into a dish in which it can spread and lie a quarter of an inch deep. If set over ice this will soon be- come firm, and can then be stamped out into rounds with an inch and a half cutter; arrange these for the present on a flat dish while you melt all the pieces and set the liquid again, stamping it out into little rounds the size of a shilling. Now lay over each larger round a little mould of anchovy cream (see No. 4, Menu ii.), put a little tomato button on the top of each, arrange the little savouries on a flat dish with watercress as a garnish, and serve.

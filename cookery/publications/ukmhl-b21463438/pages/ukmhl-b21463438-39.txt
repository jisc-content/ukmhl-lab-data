CREAM OF MACAROONS WITH NOYEAU. 31 solved in hot milk, take the bowl out of the stew- pan, and continue to stir for a few minutes, adding two ounces of macaroons which have been soaked in milk and pressed through a sieve; whip all together, add a gill of whipped cream, and a liqueur- glass of noyeau. Line a wetted plain mould with paper, pour in the mixture, set in on ice, and in due course turn the cream out, remove the paper, and serve with a syrup tinted pink with cochineal, and flavoured with noyeau and the juice of half a lemon. 4. Make a dozen cups with custard a la Royale blanche as in the case of ceufs a la Russe. Make the yellow custard also. Treat the latter in this way :â€” When cold empty it into a mortar, add an ounce of butter, eight of fillets of anchovies that have been freed from oil, a large dessert-spoonful of finely minced olives, and a dozen capers ; pound tho- roughly, moisten with a spoonful of cream, arrange the farce in the hollows of the cups, forming it dome- wise above the level of the cups, dust granulated hard-boiled egg over all, and serve as in the case of ceufs a la Russe.

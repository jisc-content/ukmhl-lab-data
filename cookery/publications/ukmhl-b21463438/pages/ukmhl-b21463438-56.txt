4« FIFTY LUNCHES. 4. Cut up a pound of rhubarb, and simmer it in just sufficient syrup flavoured with the zest of a lemon to cover it. When it is soft enough to barb creams. turn to a Pureei strain it from the juice, to which add half an ounce of dissolved gelatine, pass all through a hair, sieve adding to the pulp thus obtained a couple of gills of whipped cream ; whip altogether, and hll a dozen wetted darioles with the cream, set them on ice, and when firm turn them out, arrange them in a circle on a pretty dish and serve. The forced rhubarb is the best for this on account of its colour ; the sweetening will, of course, be in the syrup—ten ounces of sugar to a pint, but be careful not to have it too sweet ; a sherry-glass of kirsch is an immense improvement.

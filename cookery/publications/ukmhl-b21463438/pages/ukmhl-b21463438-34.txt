FIFTY LUNCHES. 26 2. Choose a nice neck of mutton, divide it into the neatest cutlets you can, trim them, give them a dust of pepper and salt, and place them en Outlets with marinadc during the night. For the garnish spinach you want one ounce of blanched onion, a Louise Pouncl Â°f spinach that has been picked, washed well, blanched for live minutes in boiling salted water, and drained of all moisture, one small cabbage lettuce, also blanched and drained, and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Take a quart stewpan. melt the butter at the bottom of it over a low fire ; put into it the onion very finely shredded, fry this gently till it turns a pale yellow, and then add half an ounce of flour, the whole of the spinach and the lettuce also finely cut up. Stir the vegetables about in the melted butter till they begin to change colour, and then moisten with a quarter of a pint of good broth ; stir this well, and put in a teaspoon- ful of powdered white sugar, three saltspoonfuls of salt, and a good dusting of black pepper. Add another gill of broth and let the vegetables simmer for about fifteen minutes, stirring them to prevent their catching at the bottom of the pan, till they assume the consistency of a thick puree, when they should be passed through a wire sieve. Add a tablespoonful of cream and they will be ready to accompany your cutlets. These should be drained from their mari- nade, wiped dry, dipped in melted butter, and grilled over a bright clear fire. Prepare a neat border of pounded rice, fill it with the puree burning hot, and arrange the cutlets round the outside of the circle, with bunches of watercress for garnish.

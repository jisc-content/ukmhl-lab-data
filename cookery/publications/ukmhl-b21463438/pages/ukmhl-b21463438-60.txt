MENU XV. 52 (April.) Coquillea a la Carmelite. Pigeons en matelote. Gateau en demi-deuiL Darioles a la Milanaise. i. For this we require six scallop shells, either of silver or china, four ounces of cooked salt or fresh cod, two hard-boiled eggs, two fillets of S/Ca//Â°^ / anchovies freed from oil, and two gills of Carmelite. ^sn broth or milk flavoured with anchovy. Turn the last to a sauce with half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour, bring to the boil, and stir in a tablespoonful of tomato conserve ; mix well, and pass through a hair sieve. Now butter the shells, chop up the cold fish, also the hard-boiled eggs, put the mince into a bowl, season it with salt and white pepper, add a pinch of mace, cut up the fillets of anchovy and mix them with the mince, and then moisten with enough of the sauce to bring the mixture to the consistency of rather fluid jam. Fill the shells with this, smooth their surfaces, shake a canopy of finely sifted raspings over them, dot a few little pieces of butter over them also, and then bake, but do not allow the coquilles to dry up in that process. They should come to table moist and thoroughly hot.

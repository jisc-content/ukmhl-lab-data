SALADE A LA BELLE ALLIANCE. 39 with some of the reduced syrup ; place a pippin on each, mask them all with the rest of the syrup, and serve with Devonshire, cream, which, if you like, may be squeezed through a forcing bag in little cones between each pippin, or in the centre of the dish. 4. This kind of salad makes a nice luncheon savoury:â€”Take from four to six ounces of cold cooked chicken and from two to three (half the weight) of cold cooked tongue ; ^j^f^ la cut both meats into julienne-like strips, ancc. open a small (the smallest) tin of pate de foie gras, melt off the fat, wipe the pate, and cut it up into slices also ; boil, and set to get cold a quarter bundle of seakale ; cut the vegetable into strips, using a silver dessert-knife ; now take a silver or china le'gumiere, make a bed at the bottom of it with some of the seakale, over that arrange a layer of mixed meats, then more seakale, sprinkling over each layer a seasoning of pepper and salt ; finish the arrange- ment in dome shape, with strips of seakale outside, and moisten with mayonnaise sauce, keeping the whole as cold as possible ; garnish round the base of the dome with hard-boiled eggs in halves, turned olives, and little heaps of broken jelly.

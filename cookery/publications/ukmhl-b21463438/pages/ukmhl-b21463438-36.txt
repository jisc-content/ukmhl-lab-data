Keep it very cold before whipping, and pass in the powdered praline at the same time. 4. For these you will require six open short paste cases, which may be baked in oval or round patty- , , pans. The paste should be made in this Croustades x „ , £ a luifji saiaci way :—Put three ounces of flour upon a a la Bohc- pastry-board, make a little well in the micnne- centre of it, into that put an ounce and a half of butter and the yolk of one egg ; mix, adding an ounce and a half of grated Parmesan cheese and half a gill of water to complete the paste. Roll this out as thin as possible, butter the patty-pans, line them with it, prick the hollows and fill them with raw rice, bake a pale brown ; cool, empty the cases thus made, and when cold turn them out of the pans. To finish, fill each case with an anchovy salad made in this manner :—Allow two fillets of anchovy for each case, remove the oil from these, and cut them into quarter-inch pieces. Take for each a tablespoonful and a half of finely cut and cooked macedoine of vege- tables (the French preserved is very good). See that this is dry, then sprinkle with tarragon vinegar, mix in the anchovy pieces, finish with just enough mayonnaise sauce to moisten nicely, and arrange the salad in a little pyramid in each case. Broken aspic may be arranged in the dish with the croustades.

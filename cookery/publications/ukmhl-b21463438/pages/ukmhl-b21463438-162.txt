MENU XLVII. 154 (December.) Br6me-de-mer a la MontreuiL Escalopes de lievre a la Czarine. Pommes aux fruits a la Parisienne. Croustades de truffes. i. This dish may be made with any white fish. I take sea-bream for a change. Remove the flesh of a fish weighing a pound or pound and a fa^lontrcuil cluar^er m one ^onS piece from each side. Make three gills of broth with the bones, using milk for the moistening. Cook the fillets in this as explained for poached salmon, Menu vii.; set them aside under a weight, and strain in the broth. Thicken this with three-quarters of an ounce of butter and the same of flour, skim, add half a pot of Ruff's cream of lobster, stir well over the fire, and strain through a hair sieve. Return the sauce to the rinsed-out stew- pan, and, setting it over a quick fire, bring to the boil, reducing one-third of its quantity, and stirring continually till that has been effected. Now butter a gratin-dish, and having trimmed each fillet neatly in an oval form, lay them side by side upon it; mask them with the sauce, smoothing it with a palette- knife, push the dish into the oven to heat thoroughly, then garnish all round with separately cooked balls of potato cut with an inch scoop, and serve.

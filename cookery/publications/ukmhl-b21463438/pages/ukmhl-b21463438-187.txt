Mr. Edward Arnold's List. 5 The Sportsman's Libraryâ€”Continued. A SPORTING TOUR THROUGH THE NORTHERN PARTS OF ENGLAND, AND GREAT PART OF THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND. By Colonel T. THORNTON, of Thornville Royal, in Yorkshire. With a selection from the original illustrations by Garrard, portraits of the Author, and new plates by G. E. Lodge. F. C. Bennett, and others. Large 8vo., handsomely bound, 15s. Also a limited Large-paper Edition, two guineas net. This work, published in 1804, and reviewed the next year by Sir Walte Scott in the Edinburgh Review, has never been reprinted. It is extremely interesting, not only on account of the graphic descriptions of shooting, hawking, and angling, but because of the author*s shrewd observations on the state of society and manners, and his sympathetic description of scenery. THE SPORTSMAN IN IRELAND. By COSMOPOLITE. With numerous illustrations and coloured plates by P. Chenevix Trench. NEW AND CHEAPER EDITION. A LITTLE TOUR IN IRELAND. By 'OXONIAN ' (The Very Rev. S. Reynolds Hole). With nearly forty Illustrations by JOHN LEECH. Large crown 8vo., 6s. This famous book being now entirely out of print, a new edition, containing all the original plates, has been prepared, and will be issued at a popular price, in order that it may take its share in the good work of promoting a better acquaintance with the charms of the Emerald Isle. John Leech and his friend Oxonian' could not, it is true, foresee the birth of the Irish lourist Association ; but the inimitable pencil of the artist and the genial pen of the Dean of Rochester have helped in no small degree to familiarize he Eng ish public with the numberless attractions of Ireland and its laughter-loving people.

48 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. between the flavour of English roast beef and French botiilli or Italian manzo is due to the retention or the removal of the saline and highly-flavoured soluble mate- rials. (Concentrated kreatine and kreatinine are pun- gently sapid.) The Frenchman takes them out of his bouilli, or boiled meat, and transfers them to his bouillon, or soup, which, with him, is an essential element of a meal. If he ate his meat without soup, he would be like the dogs fed on gelatin by the bone-soup com- missioners. To the Englishman, with his roast or grilled meat, soup is merely a luxury, not an absolutely necessary element of a complete dietary. What we call boiled meat, as a boiled leg of mutton or round of beef, is an intermediate preparation. The heat is here communicated by water, and the juices partially retained. Not only do we, in roasting and grilling our meat, keep the juices within it, but we concentrate them con- siderably by evaporating away some of the water by which they are naturally diluted. This is my explanation of the rationale of the chief difference between boiled meat and roasted or grilled meat. A further difference—that due to browning—is discussed in the chapter on Frying. Those accustomed to such concentration of flavour regard the milder results of boiling as insipid, for, by this process and by stewing, where much water is used, the juices Are further diluted instead of being concen- trated. It is a fairly debatable question whether the sim- plicity of taste which finds satisfaction in the milder diet is better and more desirable than the appetite for strong meat. The difference has some analogy to that between the thirst for light wine and that for stiff grog. The application of the principles above expounded

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 9Â° kind of bitterness replaces the sweetness. This peculiar flavour, judiciously used, is a powerful adjunct to cookery, and one which is shamefully neglected in our ordinary English domestic kitchens. To test this, go to one of those Swiss restaurants originally instituted in this country by that enterprising Ticinese, the late Carlo Gatti, and which are now so numerous in London and our other large towns; call for maccheroni al sago; notice the rich brown gravy, the ' sugo.' Many an English cook would use half a pound of gravy beef to produce the like ; but the basis of this is a halfpenny- worth or less of what I call a caramel compound, as an example of which I copy the following recipe from the Household Edition of Gouffe's ' Royal Cookery Book:' 1 Melt half a pound of butter; add one pound of flour; mix well, and leave on a slow fire, stirring occasionally until it becomes of a light mahogany colour. When cool it may be kept in the larder ready for use.' Gouffe' calls this ' Liaison au Roux ;' the English for liaison is a thickening. It is really fried flour. Burnt onion is another form of caramel, with a special flavour super- added. Plain sugar caramel is improved by the use of a little butter, as in making toffee. Thus prepared it is really a fried sugar rather than a baked sugar. Benrre noir (black butter) is another of the caramelised prepa- rations used by continental cooks.

This 'sugo' is greatly varied according to the requirements, by additions of

282 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. ripe grape varies from 10 to 30 per cent.â€”a very large range. The quantity of alcohol varies proportionally when the must is fermented to dryness. According to Pavy, < there are dry sherries to be met with that are free from sugar,' while in other wines the quantity of remain- ing sugar amounts to as much as 20 per cent. White of egg and gelatin are the most easily avail- able and innocent forms of nitrogenous material that may be used for sustaining or renewing the fermentation of wines that are to be artificially dried. My inquiries in the trade lead me to conclude that this is not understood as well as it should be. Both white of egg and gelatin (in the form of isinglass or otherwise) are freely used for fining, and it is well enough known that wines that have been freely subjected to such fining keep better and become drier with age, but I have never yet met a wine merchant who understood why, nor any sound ex- planation of the fact in the trade literature. When thus added to the wine already fermented, the effect is doubt- less due to the promotion of a slow, secondary fermenta- tion. The bulk of the gelatin or albumen is carried down with the sediment, but some remains in solution. There may be some doubt as to the albumen thus remaining, but none concerning the gelatin, which is freely soluble both in water and alcohol. The truly scientific mode of applying this principle would be to add the nitrogenous material to the must. I dwell thus upon this because, if fashion insists so imperatively upon dryness as to compel artificial drying, this method is the least objectionable, being a close imi- tation of natural drying, almost identical ; while there are other methods of inducing fictitious dryness that are mischievous adulterations. Generally described, these consist in producing an

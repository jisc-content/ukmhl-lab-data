GELATIN, FIBRIN, AND THE JUICES OF MEAT. 37 gelatin owed their nutritive value to their other con- stituents. According to the above-named report, and the statements of Liebig, the following, which I find on a wrapper of Liebig's ' Extract of Meat,' is justifiable : 'This Extract of Meat differs essentially from the gelatinous product obtained from tendons and muscular fibre, inasmuch as it contains 80 per cent, of nutritive matter, while the other contains 4 or 5 per cent.' Here the 4 or 5 per cent, allowed to exist in the ' gelatinous product' (i.e. ordinary kitchen stock or glaze), is attri- buted to the constituents it contains over and above the pure gelatin. The following, from a text-book largely used by medical students,1 shows the estimation in which gelatin was held at that date : ' But there is another azotised compound, Gelatin, that is furnished by animals, to which nothing analogous exists in Plants; and this is commonly reputed to possess highly nutritious pro- perties. It may be confidently affirmed, however, as a result of experiments made upon a large scale, that Gelatin is incapable of being converted into Albumen in the animal body, so that it cannot be applied to the nutrition of the albuminous tissues. And, although it might a priori be thought not unlikely that Gelatin, taken in as food, should be applied to the nutrition of the gelatinous tissues, yet neither observation nor ex- periment bears out such a probability.' Further on, Dr. Carpenter says : ' The use of gelatin as food would seem to be limited to its power of furnishing a certain amount of combustive material that may assist in main- taining the heat of the body.' Subsequent experiments, however, have refuted these conclusions. I must not be tempted to describe them 1 Carpenter's Ma?iual of Physiology, 3rd edition, 1846, p. 267.

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 320 some kind of chemical action of a destructive or oxidis- ing character, and is, therefore, theoretically analogous to the source of power in a steam-engine; but when they come to the practical question of the demand for working fuel or food, they abandon this analogy. Pavy says (' Treatise on Food and Dietetics,' page 6): ' In the liberation of actual force, a complete analogy may be traced between the animal system and a steam- engine. Both are media for the conversion of latent into actual force. In the animal system, combustible material is supplied under the form of the various kinds of food, and oxygen is taken in for the process of respiration. From the chemical energy due to the combination of these, force is liberated in an active state; and, besides manifesting itself as heat, and in other ways peculiar to the animal system, is capable of performing mechanical work.' In another place (page 59 of same work), after describing Liebig's view, Dr. Pavy says : ' The facts which have been already adduced' (those above described on the nitrogen eliminated by the kidneys), ' suffice to refute this doctrine. Indeed, it may be considered as abundantly proved that food does not require to become organised tissue before it can be rendered available for force- production.' On page 81 he says : 'While nitrogenous matter may be regarded as forming the essential basis of structures possessing active or living properties, the non-nitrogenous principles maybe looked upon as supplying the source of power. The one may be spoken of as hold- ing the position of the instrument of action, while the other supplies the motive power. Nitrogenous alimen- tary matter may, it is true, by oxidation contribute to the generation of the moving force, but, as has been ex- plained, in fulfilling this office there is evidence before us to show that it is split up into two distinct portions, one

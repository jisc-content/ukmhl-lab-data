173 CHAPTER XL ' THE COOKERY OF VEGETABLES. My readers will remember that I referred to Haller's statement,'Dimidium corporis humani gluten est,' which applies to animals generally, viz. that half of their sub- stance is gelatin, or that which by cookery becomes gelatin. This abundance depends upon the fact that the walls of the cells and the frame-work of the tissues are composed of this material. In the vegetable structure we encounter a close analogy to this. Cellular structure is still more clearly defined than in the animal, as may be easily seen with the help of a very moderate microscopic power. Pluck one of the fibrils that you see shooting down into the water of hyacinth glasses, or, failing one of these, any other succulent rootlet. Crush it between two pieces of glass and examine. At the end there is a loose spongy mass of rounded cells ; these merge into oblong rectang- ular cells surrounding a central axis of spiral tube or tubes or greatly elongated cell structure. Take a thin slice of stem, or leaf, or flower, or bark, or pith, examine in like manner, and cellular structure of some kind will display itself, clearly demonstrating that whatever may be the contents of these round, oval, hexagonal, oblong, or otherwise regular or irregular cells, we cannot cook and eat any whole vegetable, or slice of vegetable, without encountering a large quantity of cell wall.

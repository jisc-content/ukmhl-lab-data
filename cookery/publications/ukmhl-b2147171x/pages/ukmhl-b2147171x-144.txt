132 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. albumen, gelatin and fibrin, show that there is but little difference in the ultimate chemical composition of these, so far as the constituents there named are concerned : Casein Carbon 53 "83 Hydrogen 7.J5 Nitrogen 15-65 Oxygen Sulphur \ 23'37 Albumen Gelatin Fibrin Carbon • 53'5 50-40 527 Hydrogen .7-0 6-64 6-9 Nitrogen • iS-S 18-34 15-4 Oxygen . 22"0 24-62 23*5 Sulphur . 16 99 1-2 Phosphorus . . 0-4 ii 0-3 We may therefore conclude that, regarding these from the point of view of nitrogenous or flesh-forming, and carbonaceous or heat-giving constituents, these chief materials of flesh and of cheese are about equal. The same is the case as regards the fat. The quantity in the carcass of oxen, calves, sheep, lambs, and pigs varies, according to Dr. Edward Smith, from 16 per cent, to 31*3 per cent, in moderately fatted animals; while in whole-milk cheeses it varies from 21 '68 per cent, to 32^1 per cent, coming down in skim-milk cheeses as low as 6"3. Dr. Smith includes Neufchatel cheese, containing 1874 per cent, among the whole-milk cheeses. He does not seem to be aware that the cheese made up between straws and sold under that name is a ricotta, or crude curd of skim-milk cheese. Its just value is about threepence per pound. In Italy, where it forms the basis of some delicious dishes (such as budino

122 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. collapse that should occur when the steam condenses, the display of which collapse is an indication of the good quality of the contents. By ' good quality' I mean good of its kind ; but, as everybody knows who has tried beef and mutton thus prepared, it is not satisfactory. The preservation from putrefactive decomposition is perfectly successful, and all the original constituents of the meat are there. It is apparently tender, but practically toughâ€”i.e. it falls to pieces at a mere touch of the knife, but these fragments offer to the teeth a peculiar resistance to proper masti- cation. I may describe their condition as one of per- tinacious fibrosity. The fibres separate, but they are stubborn fibres still. ' This is a very serious matter, for, were it otherwise, the great problem of supplying our dense population with an abundance of cheap animal food would have been solved about twenty years ago. As it is, the plain tinned-meat enterprise has not developed to any impor- tant extent beyond affording a variation with salt junk on board ship. What is the rationale of this defect ? Beyond the general statement that the meat is 'overdone,' I have met with no attempt at explanation, but am not, there- fore, disposed to give up the riddle without attempting a solution. Reverting to what I have already said concerning the action of heat on the constituents of flesh, it is evident that in the first place the long exposure to the boiling point must harden the albumen. Syntonin, or muscle- fibrin, the material of the ultimate contractile fibres of the muscle, is coagulated by boiling water, and further hardened by continuous boiling, in the same manner as albumen. Thus the muscle-fibres themselves, and the

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 28o increased profit on selling the commodity at a given price. In this case an opposite result is obtained. The gypsum, or Spanish earth, is used in considerable quan- tity, and- leaves a bulky residuum, which carries away some of the wine with it, and thus increases the cost to the seller of the saleable result. Having referred so often to dry wines, I should explain the chemistry of this so-called dryness. The fermentation of wine is the result of a vegetable growth, that of the yeast, a microscopic fungus {Penicillium glaucum). The must, or juice of the grape, obtains the germ spontaneouslyâ€”probably from the atmosphere. Two distinct effects are produced by this fermentation or growth of fungus : first, the sugar of the must is con- verted into alcohol; second, more or less of the albu- minous or nitrogenous matter of the must is consumed as food by the fungus. If uninterrupted, this fermenta- tion goes on either until the supply of sufficient sugar is stopped, or until the supply of sufficient albuminous matter is stopped. The relative proportions of these determine which of the two shall be first exhausted. If the sugar is exhausted before the nitrogenous food of the fungus, a dry wine is produced ; if the nitrogenous food is first consumed, the remaining unfermented sugar produces a sweet wine. If the sugar is greatly in excess, a vin de liqueur is the result, such as the Frontignac, Lunel, Rivesaltes, &c, made from the muscat grape. The varieties of grape are very numerous. Rusby, in his 'Visit to the Vineyards of Spain and France,' gives a list of 570 varieties, and, as far back as 1827, Cavalow enumerated more than 1,500 different wines in France alone. From the above it will be understood that, cceteris paribus, the poorer the grape the drier the wine ; or that

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 3°o Compare this with the beef and potatoes above, and it will be seen that it is superior in every item excepting the zvater. One hundred ounces of oatmeal contain 1-9 ounce more of albumen than is contained in 100 ounces of beef and potatoes mixed in equal proportions. The 100 ounces of oatmeal supplies 39-6 ounces more of carbo-hydrate (starch). The 100 ounces of oatmeal is superior to the extent of 3 "8 ounces in sugar. It has the advantage by 37 ounces in fat, and 0*9 ounce in salts, but the mixed diet beats the oatmeal by containing ounces more water; nearly four times as much. This deficiency is readily supplied in the cookery. These figures explain a puzzle that may have sug- gested itself to some of my thoughtful readers—viz. the smallness of the quantity of dry oatmeal that is used in making a large portion of porridge. If we could, in like manner, see our portion of beef or mutton and potatoes reduced to dryness, the smallness of the quantity of actually solid food required for a meal would be simi- larly manifest. An alderman's banquet in this condition would barely fill a breakfast cup. I cannot at all agree with those of my vegetarian friends who denounce flesh-meat as a prolific source of disease, as inflaming the passions, and generally de- moralising. Neither am I at all disposed to make a reli- gion of either eating, or drinking, or abstaining. There are certain albuminoids, certain carbo-hydrates, certain hydro-carbons, and certain salts demanded for our sus- tenance. Excepting in fruit, these are not supplied by nature in a fit condition for our use. They must be pre- pared. Whether we do all the preparation in the kitchen by bringing the produce of the earth directly there, or whether, on account of our ignorance and incapacity as cooks, we pass our food through the stomach, intestines.

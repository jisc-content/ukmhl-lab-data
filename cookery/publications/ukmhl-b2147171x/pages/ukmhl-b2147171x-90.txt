THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 78 it is immersed in an atmosphere nearly saturated with its ozvn vapours. Let it be clearly understood that I refer to the vapours as they rise from the meat, and not to the vapour of burnt dripping, which Rumford describes. The acrid properties of the products of such partial dissociation are far better understood by modern chemists than they were in Rumford's time. His water dripping-pan effectually prevents their for- mation. It is still manufactured of the precise pattern shown in the drawing, copied from Rumford's, and cooks who understand their business at all use it as a matter of course. The few domestic fireplace-ovens that existed in Rumford's time were clumsily heated by raking some of the fire from the grate into a space left below the oven. Those of the best modern kitcheners are heated by flues going round them, generally starting from the top, which thus attains the highest temperature. The radiation from this does the 'browning' for which Rumford's blow- pipes were designed. Here I differ from my teacher, as, according to my view of the philosophy of roasting, the browning, or the application of the highest temperature, should take place at the beginning rather than the end of the process, in order that a crust of firmly coagulated albumen may surround the joint and retain the juices of the meat. All that is necessary to obtain this effect in a sufficient degree is to raise the roasting-oven to an excessive temperature before the meat is put in. Supposing an equal fire is maintained all the while, this excessive initial temperature will presently decline, because, when the meat is in the oven, the radiant heat from its sides is intercepted by the joint and doing work upon it;

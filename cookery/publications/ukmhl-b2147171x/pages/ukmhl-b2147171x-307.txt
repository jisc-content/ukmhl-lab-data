The question is not whether we are herbivorous or carnivorous animals. It is perfectly certain that we are neither. The carnivora feed on flesh alone, and eat that flesh raw. Nobody proposes that we should do this. The herbivora eat raw grass. Nobody suggests that we should follow their example. It is'perfectly clear that man cannot be classed with the carnivorous animals, nor the herbivorous animals, nor with the graminivorous animals. His teeth are not constructed for munching and grinding raw grain, nor his digestive organs for assimilating such grain in this condition. He is not even to be classed with the omnivorous animals. He stands apart from all as The Cooking' Animal. It is true that there was a time when our ancestors ate raw flesh, including that of each other. In the limestone caverns of this and other European countries we find human bones gnawed by human teeth, and split open by flint implements for the evident pur- pose of extracting the marrow, according to the domestic economy of the period.

Besides these they probably included roots, succulent plants, nuts, and such fruit as then existed. There are many among us who are very proud of their ancient lineage, and who think it honourable to go back as far as possible and to maintain the customs

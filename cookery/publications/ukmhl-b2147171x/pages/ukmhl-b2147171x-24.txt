12 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. Usually we have no very strong motive for removing either these or the dissolved carbonate of lime, or the atmospheric gases from water, but there is another class of impurities of serious importance. These are the organic matters dissolved in all water that has run over land covered with vegetable growth, or, more especially, that which has received contributions from sewers or any other form of house drainage. Such water supplies nutriment to those microscopic abomina- tions, the micrococci, bacilli, bacteria, &c, which are now shown to be connected with blood poisoning. These little pests are harmless, and probably nutritious, when cooked, but in their raw and growing state are horribly prolific in the' blood of people who are in certain states of what is called ' receptivity.' They (the bacteria, &c.) appear to be poisoned or somehow killed off by the digestive secretions of the blood of some people, and nourished luxuriantly in the blood of others. As nobody can be quite sure to which class he belongs, or may presently belong, or whether the water supplied to his household is free from blood-poisoning organisms, cooked water is a safer beverage than raw water. I should add that this germ theory of disease is disputed by some who maintain that the source of the diseases attributed to such microbia is chemical poison, the microbia (i.e. little living things) are merely accidental, or creatures fed on the disease-producing poison. In either case the boiling is effectual, as such organic poisons when cooked lose their original virulent properties. The requirement for this simple operation of cooking increases with the density of our population, which, on reaching a certain degree, renders the pollution of all water obtained from the ordinary sources almost in- evitable.

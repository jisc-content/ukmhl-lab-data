COUNT RUMFORD'S ROASTER. 8r to a glowing heat, and that of the floor in a somewhat lower degree. When this heating is completed (the judg- ment of which constitutes the chief element of skill in thus baking) the embers are carefully brushed out from the floor, the loaves, &c, inserted by means of a flat battledore with a long handle, called a ' peel,' and the door closed and firmly luted round, not to be opened until the ope- ration is complete. Baked clay is an excellent radiator, and therefore the surface of bricks forming the arched roof of the oven radiates vigorously upon its contents below, which are thus heated at top by radiation from the roof, and at bottom by direct contact with the floor of the oven. The difference between the compact bottom crust, and the darker bubble-bearing top crust of an ordinary loaf is thus explained. As the baking of a large joint of meat is a longer operation than the baking of bread, there is another reason besides that already given for the inferiority of meat when baked in a baker's oven constructed on this principle. The slow cooling-down must tend to produce a flabbiness and insipidity similar to that of the roast meat which is served at restaurants where a joint remains ' in cut' for two or three hours. Of this I speak theore- tically, not having had an opportunity of tasting a joint that has been cooked in a brick oven of the construction above described; but I have observed the advantage of maintaining a steady heat throughout the process of roasting (after the first higher heating above described), in the iron oven of a kitchener, or American stove, or gas oven. Another and somewhat original method of roasting is that which is carried out in ' Captain Warren's Cooking Pot,' concerning the practical result of which I hear con- flicting opinions. It is a large pot containing water, G

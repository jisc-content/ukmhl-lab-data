INTRODUCTORY. 7 It is a matter of preparationâ€”not exactly what is called cooking, but equivalent to what cooking should be. It is the preparation which has converted the grass food of the ox into another kind of food which we can assimilate very easily. The fact that we use the digestive and nutrient apparatus of sheep, oxen, &c, for the preparation of our food, is merely a transitory barbarism, to be ultimately superseded when my present subject is sufficiently un- derstood and applied to enable us to prepare the con- stituents of the vegetable kingdom in such a manner that they shall be as easily assimilated as the prepared grass which we call beef and mutton, and which we now use only on account of our ignorance of the subject treated in the following chapters. I do not presume to assert or suggest that my efforts towards the removal of this ignorance will transport us at once into a vegetarian millennium, but if they only open the gate and show us that there is a road on which we may travel to- wards great improvements in the preparation of our food as regards flavour, economy, and wholesomeness, my reasonable readers will not be disappointed. So much of cookery being effected by the applica- tion of heat, a sketch of the general laws of heat might be included in this introductory chapter, but for the necessary extent of the subject. I omit it without compunction, having ahead}/ written ' A Simple Treatise on Heat,' which is divested of technical difficulties by presenting simply the pheno- mena and laws of Nature without any artificial scholastic complications. Messrs. Chatto & Windus have brought out this little essay in a cheap form, and, in spite of the risk of being accused of puffing my own wares, I recom- mend its perusal to those who are earnestly studying the whole philosophy of cookery.

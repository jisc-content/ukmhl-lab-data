148 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. cheese," in fact, soon became a by-word and a reproach, and it is stated that last year a large quantity of poor, unsophisticated cheese was sold under that name, and thus increased its evil reputation. ' But the utilisation of the skim-milk still remained a necessity to the managers of the " creameries," if they were to be commercially successful. The question was, therefore, considered whether it would not be possible to make an artificial cream which should replace the natural cream which had been taken off the milk. This idea was soon put to a practical test, and with most remarkable results. ' The process now adopted begins with the manufac- ture of artificial cream as follows: A certain quantity of skim-milk is heated, to about 85° Fahr., and one- half the quantity of either lard, oleomargarine, or olive oil, as the case may be. These substances are conveyed through separate pipes into an " emulsion" machine, which subdivides both materials to a surprising degree, while it mixes them thoroughly together—the arrange- ment insuring that the machine is regularly fed with the due proportions of the substances which are being used. It is stated that the artificial cream made with olive oil in this way is not objected to in the United States for use in tea and coffee. ' For the manufacture of imitation cheese, about 4^ per cent, of this imitation cream is added to the skim-milk. The latter being raised to 85° Fahr., and the former to 13 5° Fahr. or upwards, the mixture attains a temperature of about 900 Fahr. The re- mainder of the process is identical with that used in the manufacture of American Cheddar cheese, except that a special mechanical agitator is used to insure that the curd shall be evenly stirred and cooked, so as to

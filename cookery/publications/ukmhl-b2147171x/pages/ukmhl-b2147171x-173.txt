FAT—MILK. 161 There is neither coagulation nor dehydration to be feared as regards the fat, unless the heat is raised to that of the dissociation of the fixed oils, which, as already explained, is much above 212°; the change which then takes place- in the fat (analogous to that caramelising sugar) is not dehydration properly so called, although the elements of water or hydrogen may be driven off. Hydration is a combining of water as water, not with the elements of water as elements, and the water of most hydrates becomes dissociated at a temperature a little above the boiling point of water. My own experiments on gelatin show that hydration occurs when crude gelatin is exposed to the action of water at or below the boiling point, and that dehydration takes place at and above the boiling point, or otherwise stated, the boiling point is the critical temperature where either hydration or dehydration may occur according to the circumstances. The original membrane immersed in zvater at 212° becomes hydrated, while hydrated gelatin heated to 2120 and exposed to the air is dehydrated. Fat is only dissociated as regards its glycerine, and is cooked thereby. The dietetic value of milk is obvious enough from the fact that the young of the human species and all the mammalia,whether carnivorous, graminivorous, or herbiv- orous, are entirely fed upon it during the period of their most rapid growth. This, however, does not justify the practice of describing milk as a model diet and tabulating its composition as that which should represent the com- position of food for adults. The fallacy of this is evident from the fact that grass is the model food of the cow, and milk that of the calf. Although the grass contains all the constituents of the milk, their proportions are widely different; besides this the grass contains a very M

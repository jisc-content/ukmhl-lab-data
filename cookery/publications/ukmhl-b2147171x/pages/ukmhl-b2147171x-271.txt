CONDIMENTS. 259 opium-eater or smoker or morphia injector are more intense than those of the tea-drinker, and the reaction proportionally greater.

But, when we are in a state of sound health, any disturbance or alteration must be a change for the worse, must throw us out of health to an extent pro- portionate to the potency of the drug. I might illustrate this by a multitude of familiar examples, but they would carry me too far away from my proper subject. There is, however, one class of such remedies which are directly connected with the chemistry of cookery. I refer to the condiments that act as ' tonics,' excluding common salt, which is an article of food, though often miscalled a condiment. Salt is food simply because it supplies the blood with one of its normal and necessary constituents, chloride of sodium, without which

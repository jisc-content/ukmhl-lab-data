36 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. pared it in the form of jellies for invalids, and estimated the nutritive value of their soups by the consistency of the jelly which they formed on cooling, which thickness is due to the gelatin they contain. Isinglass, which is simply the swim-bladder of the sturgeon and similar fishes cut into shreds, was especially esteemed, and sold at high prices. This is the purest natural form of gelatin. Everybody believed that the callipash and callipee of the alderman's turtle soup contributed largely to his proverbial girth, and those who could not afford to pay for the gelatin of the reptile, made mock turtle from the gelatinous tissues of calves'-heads and pigs'-feet. About fifty or sixty years ago, the French Academy of Sciences appointed a bone-soup commission, consist- ing of some of the most eminent savants of the period. They worked for above ten years upon the problem submitted to them, that of determining whether or not the soup made by boiling bones until only their mineral matter remained solid, is, or is not, a nutritious food for the inmates of hospitals, &c. In the voluminous report which they ultimately submitted to the Academy, they decided in the negative. Baron Liebig became the popular exponent of their conclusions, and vigorously denounced gelatin, as not merely a worthless article of food, but as loading the system with material that demands wasteful effort for its removal. The Academicians fed dogs on gelatin alone, found that they speedily lost flesh, and ultimately died of starvation. A multitude of similar experiments showed that gelatin alone will not support animal life, and hence the conclusion that pure gelatin is worthless as an article of food, and that ordinary soups containing

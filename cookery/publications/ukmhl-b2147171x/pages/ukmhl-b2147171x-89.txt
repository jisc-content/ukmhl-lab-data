77 COUNT RUMFORD'S ROASTER. This modification he called a ' roasting-oven,' to dis- tinguish it from the first described, the ' roaster.' He states that the roasting-oven is not quite so effective as the roaster, but from its greater cheapness may be largely used. This anticipation has been realised. The modern ' kitchener,' which in so many forms is gradually and steadily supplanting the ancient open range, is an appa- ratus in which roasting in the open air before a fire is superseded by roasting in a closed chamber or roasting- oven. Having made three removals within the last twelve years, each preceded by a tedious amount of house-hunting, I have seen a great many kitchens of newly-built houses, and find that about 90 per cent, of these have closed kitcheners, and only about 10 percent, are fitted with open ranges of the old pattern. Bottle- jacks, like smoke-jacks and spits, are gradually falling into disuse. When these kitcheners were first introduced, a great point was made by the manufacturer of the distinction between the roasting and the baking-oven ; the first being provided with a special apparatus for effecting ventila- tion by devices more or less resembling that in Rum- ford's roasting-oven. Gradually these degenerated into mere shams, and now in the best kitcheners even a pre- tence to ventilation is abandoned. Having reasoned out my own theory of the conditions demanded for perfect roasting some time ago (about 1860, when I lectured on ' Household Philosophy,' to a class of ladies at the Bir- mingham and Midland Institute), I have watched the gradual disappearance of these concessions to popular prejudice with some interest, as they show how practical experience has confirmed my theory, which, as already expounded, is that the meat should be cooked by the action of radiant heat, projected towards it from all sides, while

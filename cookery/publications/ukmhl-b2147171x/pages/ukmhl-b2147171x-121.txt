FR YING. 109 mere unreasoning prejudice, vegetable oils and vege- table fats will largely supplant those of animal origin in every element of our dietary. We are but just beginning to understand them. Chevreul, who was the first to teach us the chemistry of facts, is still living, and we are only learning how to make butter (not 'inferior Dorset,' but 'choice Normandy') without the aid of dairy produce. There is, therefore, good reason for anticipating that the inexhaustible supplies of oil obtain- able from the vegetable world—especially from tropical vegetation—will ere long be freely available for kitchen uses, and the now popular product of the Chicago hog factories will be altogether banished therefrom, and used only for greasing cart-wheels and other machinery. As a practical conclusion of this part of my subject, I will quote from the ' Oil Trade Review' of this month, December 1884, the current wholesale prices of some of the oils possibly available for frying purposes : olive oil, from 43/. to 90/. per tun of 252 gallons ; cod oil, 36/. per tun ; sardine or train {i.e. the oil that drains from pil- chards, herrings, sardines, &c, when salted), 27/. \os. to 28/. per tun ; cocoanut, from 35/. to 38/. per ton of 20 cwt. (This, in the case of oil, is nearly the same as the measured tun.) Palm, from 38/. to 40/. I or. per ton ; palm-nut or copra, 31/. \os. per ton ; refined cotton- seed, 30/. ioj. to 31/. per ton ; lard, 53/. to 55/. per ton. The above are the extreme ranges of each class. I have not copied the technical names and prices of the inter- mediate varieties. One penny per lb. is = 9/. 6s. 8d. per ton, or, in round numbers, \l. per ton may be reckoned as 1-9th of a penny per lb. Thus the present price of best refined cotton-seed oil is $\d. per lb.; of cocoanut oil, i\d. ; palm oil, from ^\d. to ^\d., while lard costs 6d. per lb. wholesale.

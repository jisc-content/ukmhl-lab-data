It is far too nutritious for this; its savoury character tempts one to eat it so freely that it would be far wiser to use it as the Swiss peasant uses his fondu —i.e. as the substantial dish of a wholesome dinner. I have tested its digestibility by eating it heartily for supper. No nightmare has followed. If I sup on a corresponding quantity of raw cheese my sleep is miser- ably eventful. A correspondent writes as follows from the Charlotte Square Young Ladies' Institution : ' I have been trying the various ways of cooking cheese mentioned in your articles in " Knowledge," and have one or two improve- ments to suggest in the making of cheese pudding.

I have not succeeded in making any improvement in the fondu (see page 139), which is delightful.' My recollections of the fondu of the Swiss peasant being so eminently satisfactory on all points—nutritive or sustaining value, appetising flavour and economy—I have sought for a recipe in several cookery-books, and find at last a near approach to it in an old edition of Mrs. Rundell's ' Domestic Cookery.' A similar dish is described in that useful book ' Cre-Fydd's Family Fare,' under the name of ' Cheese Souffle or Fondu! 1 I had 1 Forty or fifty years ago these cheese fonctus were one of the usual courses at many-course banquets, but now they are rarely found in the menu of such dinners. There is good reason for this. They are far too

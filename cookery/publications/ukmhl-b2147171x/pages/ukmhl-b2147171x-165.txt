Supposing whole rice is used—and I think this is the best—the cheese may be sprinkled among the grains of rice and well stirred or mashed up with them. The ad- dition of a little brown gravy to this, with or without chicken giblets, gives us an Italian risotto. The Indian- corn stirabout of the poor Irish cottier would be much improved both in flavour and nutritive value by the addition of a little grated cheese. Pease pudding is not improved by cheese. The chemistry of this will come out when I explain the com- position of peas, beans, &c. The same applies to pea soup. I might enumerate other methods of cooking cheese by thus adding it in a finely-divided state to other kinds of food, but if I were to express my own convictions on the subject I should stir up prejudice by naming some mixtures which many people would denounce.

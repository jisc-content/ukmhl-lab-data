THE COOKERY OF VEGETABLES. 183 gum,' 'gommeline,' 'starch gum,' and 'Alsace gum,' from its resemblance to gum-arabic, for which it is now very extensively substituted. Solutions of this in bottles are sold in the stationers' shops under various names for desk uses. The remarkable feature of this conversion of starch into dextrin is, that it is accompanied by no change of chemical composition. Starch is composed of six equi- valents of carbon, ten of hydrogen, and five of oxygenâ€” C6H10O5, i.e. six of carbon and five of water or its ele- ments. Dextrin has exactly the same composition ; so also has gum-arabic when purified. But their properties differ considerably. Starch, as everybody knows, when dried is white and opaque and pulverent; dextrin, similarly dried, is transparent and brittle ; gum-arabic the same. If a piece of starch, or a solution of starch, is touched by a solution of iodine, it becomes blue almost to blackness, if the solution is strong; no such change occurs when the iodine solution is added to dex- trin or gum. A solution of dextrin when mixed with potash changes to a rich blue colour when a little sul- phate of copper is added ; no such effect is produced by gum-arabic, and thus we have an easy test for distin- guishing between true and fictitious gum-arabic. The technical name for describing this persistence of composition with changes of properties is isomerism, and bodies thus related are said to be isomeric with each other. Another distinguishing characteristic of dextrin is that it produces a right-handed rotation on a ray of polarised light, hence its name, from dexter, the right. The conversion of starch into dextrin is a very important element of the subject of vegetable cooking, inasmuch as starch food cannot be assimilated until this conversion has taken place, either before or after we eat

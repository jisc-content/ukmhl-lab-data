187 THE COOKERY OF VEGETABLES. special laboratory or kitchen for effecting this preliminary- cookery of vegetable food. Ruminating animals have a special stomach cavity for this purpose in which the food, after mastication, is held for some time and kept warm before passing into the cavity which secretes the gastric juice. The crop of grain-eating birds appears to perform a similar function. It is there mixed with a secretion corresponding to saliva, and is thus partially maltedâ€”in this case before mastication in the gizzard. At a later stage of digestion, the starch that has escaped conversion by the saliva is again subjected to the action of animal diastase contained in the pancreatic juice, which is very similar to saliva. It is a fair inference from these facts that creatures like ourselves, who are not provided with a crop or compound stomach, and manifestly secrete less saliva than horses or other grain-munching animals, require some preliminary assistance when we adopt graminiv- orous habits ; and one part of the business of cookery is to supply such preliminary treatment to the oats, barley, wheat, maize, peas, beans, &c, which we cultivate and use for food. I may add that the stomach itself appears to do very little, possibly nothing, towards the digestion of starch. The primary conversion into dextrin is effected by the saliva, and the subsequent digestion of this takes place in the duodenum and following portions of the intestinal canal. This applies equally to the less easily digested material of the vegetable tissue, described in the pre- ceding chapter. Hence the greater length of the intes- tinal canal in herbivorous animals as compared with the carnivora. Having described the changes effected by heat upon starch, and referred to its further conversion into dextrin

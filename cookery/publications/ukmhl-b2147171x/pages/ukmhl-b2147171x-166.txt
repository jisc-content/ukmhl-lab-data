154 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. cheese mixtures to others with some misgivings as re- gards palatability, after learning the revelations of Darwin on the persistence of heredity. It is quite possible that, being a compound of the Swiss Mattieu with the Welsh Willi ams (cheese on both sides), I may inherit an abnor- mal fondness for this staple food of the mountaineers. Be this as it may, so far as the mere palate is con- cerned ; but in the chemistry of all my advocacy of cheese and its cookery I have full confidence. Rendered digestible by simple and suitable cookery, and added with a little potash salt to farinaceous food of all kinds, it affords ex- actly what is required to supply a theoretically complete and a most economical dietary, without the aid of any other kind of animal food. The potash salts may be ad- vantageously supplied by a liberal second course of fruit or salad. One more of my heretical applications of grated cheese must be specified. It is that of sprinkling it freely over ordinary stewed tripe, which thus becomes extra- ordinary stewed tripe. Or a solution of cheese may be mixed with liquor of the stew. It may not be generally known that stewed tripe is the most easily digestible of all solid animal food. This was shown by the experi- ments of Dr. Beaumont on his patient, Alexis St. Martin, who was so obliging (from a scientific point of view) as to discharge a gun in such a manner that it shot away the front of his own stomach and left there, after the healing of the wound, a valved window through which, with the aid of a simple optical contrivance, the work of digestion could be watched. Dr. Beaumont found that while beef and mutton required three hours for digestion, tripe was digested in one hour.1 ' The reader who desires further information on this and kindred subjects will find it clearly and soundly treated (without any of the

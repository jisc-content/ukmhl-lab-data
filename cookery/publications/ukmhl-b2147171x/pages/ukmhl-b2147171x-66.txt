THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 54 in proportion to the weight. This is obvious enough when we consider that we cannot cut a single lump of anything into halves without exposing or creating two fresh surfaces where no surfaces were exposed before. As the evaporation of the juices is, under given condi- tions, proportionate to the surface exposed, is is evident that this process of converting the inside middle into two outside surfaces must increase the amount of evapo- ration that occurs in roasting. What, then, is the remedy for this ? It is twofold. First, to seal up the pores of these additional surfaces as completely as possible; and secondly, to diminish to the utmost the time of exposure to the dry air. Logically following up these principles, I arrive at a practical formula which will probably induce certain orthodox cooks to denounce me as a culinary paradoxer. It is this : That the smaller the joint to be roasted, the liigher the temperature to wliich its surface should be exposed. The roasting of a small joint should, in fact, be con- ducted in nearly the same manner as the grilling of a chop or steak described in my last. The surface should be crusted or browned—burned, if you please—as speedily as possible, in such wise that the juices within shall be held there under high pressure, and only allowed to escape by burst and splutters, rather than by steady evaporation. The best way of doing this is a problem to be solved by the practical cook. I only expound the principles, and timidly suggest the mode of applying them. In a metallurgical laboratory, where I am most at home, I could roast a small joint beautifully by suspending it inside a large red-hot steel-smelter's crucible, or, better still, in an apparatus called a ' muffle,' which is a fireclay tunnel open in front, and so arranged in a suitable fur-

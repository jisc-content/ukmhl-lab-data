THE BOILING OF WATER. and boiling, which is so obstinately maintained as a kitchen superstition, is demolished. The experiment described on pages 8 and 9 showed that immediately the bubbles of steam reach the surface of the water and break there—that is, when simmering commences—the thermometer reaches the boiling-point, and that however violently the boiling may afterwards occur, the thermometer rises no higher. Therefore, as a medium for heating the substances to be cooked, sim- mering water is just as effective as 'walloping' water. There are exceptional operations of cookery, wherein useful mechanical work is done by violent boiling ; but in all ordinary cookery simmering is just as effective. The heat that is applied to do more than the smallest degree of simmering is simply wasted in converting water into useless steam. The amount of such waste may be easily estimated. To raise a given quantity of water from the freezing to the boiling point demands an amount of heat represented by 18o° in Fahrenheit's thermometer, or ioo° Centigrade. To convert this into steam, 9900 Fahr. or 5500 Cent, is necessary—just five- and-a-half times as much. On a properly-constructed hot-plate or sand-bath a dozen saucepans may be kept at the true cooking tem- perature, with an expenditure of fuel commonly em- ployed in England to ' boil' one saucepan. In the great majority of so-called boiling operations, even simmering is unnecessary. Not only is a ' boiled leg of mutton ' not itself boiled, but even the water in which it is cooked should not be kept boiling, as we shall presently see. The following, written by Count Rumford nearly 100 years ago, remains applicable at the present time, in spite of all our modern research and science teaching :

174 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. constitutes far more than half of the substance of most vegetables, and therefore demands prominent consider- ation. It exists in many forms with widely differing physical properties, but with very little variation in chemical com- position, so little that in many chemical treatises cellular tissue, cellulose, lignin, and woody fibre are treated as chemically synonymous. Thus, Miller says : ' Cellular tissue forms the groundwork of every plant, and when obtained in a pure state, its composition is the same, whatever may have been the nature of the plants which furnished it, though it may vary greatly in appearance and physical characters ; thus, it is loose and spongy in the succulent shoots of germinating seeds, and in the roots of plants, such as the turnip and the potato ; it is porous and elastic in the pith of the rush and the elder; it is flexible and tenacious in the fibres of hemp and flax ; it is compact in the branches and wood of growing trees ; and becomes very hard and dense in the shells of the filbert, the peach, the cocoanut, and the Phytelephas or vegetable ivory.' Its composition in all these cases is that of a carbo- hydrate, i.e. carbon united with the elements of water, which, by the way, should not be confounded with a hydro- carbon, or compound of carbon with hydrogen simply, such as petroleum, fats, essential oils, and resins. There is, however, some little chemical difference between wooden tissue and the pure cellulose that wc have in finely carded cotton, in linen, and pure paper pulp, such as is used in making the filtering paper for chemical laboratories, which burns without leaving a weighable quantity of ash. The woody forms of cellular tissue owe their characteristic properties to an incrustration of lignin, which is often described as synonymous with

34 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. of a crustacean. When travelling, I always continue the pursuit of knowledge in restaurants by ordering any- thing that appears on the bill of fare that I have never heard of before, or cannot translate or pronounce. At a Neapolitan restaurant I found 'Gambero di Mare' on the Carta, which I translated ' Leggy things of the sea,' or sea-creepers, and ordered them accordingly. They proved to be shrimps fried in their shells, and were very deliciousâ€”like whitebait, but richer. The chitin of the shells was thus cooked to crispness, and no evil conse- quences followed. If reduced to locusts, I should, if possible, cook them in the same manner, and, as they have similar chemical composition, they would doubtless be equally good. Should any epicurean reader desire to try this dish (the shrimps, I mean), he should fry them as they come from the sea, not as they are sold by the fishmonger, these being already boiled in salt water; usually in sea water by the shrimpers who catch them, the chitin being indurated thereby. The introduction of fried and tinned locusts as an epicurean delicacy would be a boon to suffering humanity, by supplying industrial compensation to the inhabitants of districts subject to periodical plagues of locust in- vasion. The idea of eating them appears repulsive at first, so would that of eating such creepy-crawly things as shrimps, if no adventurous hero had made the first exemplary experiment. Chitin is chitin, whether elabo- rated on the land or secreted in the sea. The vegetarian locust and the cicala are free from the pungent essential oils of the really unpleasant cockchafer. That curious epicurean food, the edible birds'-nests, which has been a subject of much controversy concern- ing its composition, is commonly described as a delicate

211 CHAPTER XIII. VEGETABLE CASEIN AND VEGETABLE JUICES. As most of my readers doubtless know, peas, beans, lentils and other seeds of leguminous plants are more nutritious, theoretically, than the seeds of grasses, such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, &c. I was glad to see at the Health Exhibition a fine series of the South Ken- sington cases, displaying in the simplest and most de- monstrative manner the proximate analyses of the chief materials of animal and vegetable food. I refer to them now because they did not receive the attention they deserve. On the opening day there was, out of all the crowd, only one other besides myself bestowing any attention upon them. These cases show I lb. of wheat, oats, potatoes, peas, &c. &c, on trays ; by the side of these are bottles, containing the quantity of water in the i lb., and other trays, containing the other con- stituents of the same quantity ; the starch, gluten, casein, the mineral matter, &c, thus displaying at a glance the nutritious value of each so far as chemical analysis can display it. Those Irishmen and others who think I have been too hard upon the potato, will do well to take its nutritive measure thus, and compare it with that of other vegetable foods. I should add that these cases form a part of the permanent collection of the South Kensington Museum, and therefore may be studied at any time. P 2

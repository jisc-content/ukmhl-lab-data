119 STEWING. the juices of the meat when cold, it should not be ex- tracted in ordinary stewing, as it is in the maceration for beef-tea, and thereby appear as a scum to be rejected. It should be barely coagulated, and thus retained in the meat in as tender a condition as possible. Being a col- loid (see ante, page 115) its liability to diffusion is small. But here we encounter a serious difficulty. How is the unscientific cook to determine and maintain this tem- perature ? If you tell her that the water must not boil, she shifts her stewpan to the side of the fire, where it shall only simmer, and she firmly believes that such simmering water has a lower temperature than water that is boiling violently over the fire. ' It stands to reason ' that it must be so, and if the experimental philosopher appeals to fact and the evidence of the thermometer, he is a ' theorist.' The French cook escapes this simmering delusion by her common use of the bain-marie or ' water-bath,' as we call it in the laboratory, where it is also largely used for 'digesting' at temperatures below 2120. This is simply a vessel immersed in an outer vessel of water. The water in the outer vessel may boil, but that in the inner vessel cannot, as its evaporation keeps it below the temperature of the water from which its heat is derived. A carpenter's glue-pot is a very good and compact form of water-bath. Some ironmongers keep in stock a form of water-bath which they call a ' milk- scalder.' This resembles the glue-pot, but has an inner vessel of earthenware which is, of course, a great im- provement upon the carpenter's device, as it may be so easily cleaned. Captain Warren's, and other similar ' cooking-pots,' may be used as water-baths by removing the cover of the inner vessel. One of the incidental advantages of the bain-marie is

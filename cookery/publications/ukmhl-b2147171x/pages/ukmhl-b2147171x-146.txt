THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 134 cerned in the analysis of food, that they may supply a valuable contribution to our knowledge of this subject by simply determining the phosphate of lime contained in the ash of different kinds of cheese. I would do this myself, but, having during some ten years past nearly forsaken the laboratory for the writing-table, I have not the leisure for such work; and, worse still, have not that prime essential to practical research (especially of endowed research), a staff of obedient assistants to do the drudgery. The comparison specially demanded is between cheeses made with rennet, and those Dutch and factory cheeses the curd of which has been precipitated by hydrochloric acid. Theoretical considerations point to the conclusion that in the latter much or even all of the phosphate of lime may be left in solution in the whey, and thus the food-value of the cheese seriously lowered. We must, however, suspend judgment in the meantime. In comparing the nutritive value of cheese with that of flesh, the retention of this phosphate of lime corre- sponds with the retention of some of the juices of the meat, among which are the phosphates of the flesh. These phosphates of lime are the bone-making material of food, and have something to do in building up the brain and nervous matter, though not to the extent that is supposed by those who imagine that there is a special connection between phosphorus and the brain, or phosphorescence and spirituality. Bone contains about eleven per cent, of phosphorus, brain less than one per cent. The value of food in reference to its phosphate of lime is not merely a matter of percentage, as this salt may exist in a state of solution, as in milk, or as a solid very difficult of assimilation, as in bones. That retained in cheese is probably in an intermediate conditionâ€”not

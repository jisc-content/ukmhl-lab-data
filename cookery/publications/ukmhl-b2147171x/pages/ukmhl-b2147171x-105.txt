93 FRYING. non-poisonous disinfectant that may be poured into rivers in any quantity without danger. Though it may not be powerful enough for this, it has an appreciable effect on water slightly tainted with decomposing organic matter. This is a very curious fact. We do not know who invented toast and water, nor, so far as I can learn, has any theory of its use been expounded, yet there is extant a vague popular impression that the toast has some sort of wholesome effect on the water. I suspect that this must have been originally based on experience, probably on the experience of our forefathers or foremothers, living in country places where stagnant water was a common beverage, and various devices were adopted to render it potable. Gelatin, fibrin, albumen, &c.—i.e. all the materials of animal food—as already shown, are composed, like starch and sugar, of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with, in the case of these animal substances, the addition of nitrogen ; but this does not prevent their partial car- bonisation (or ' caramelising,' if I may invent a name to express the action which stops short of blackening). Animal fat is a hydrocarbon which may be similarly browned, and, if I am right in my generalisation of all these browning processes, an important practical conclu- sion follows, viz. that cheap soluble caramel made by skilfully heating common sugar or flour is really, as well as apparently, as valuable an element in gravies, &c, as the far more expensive colouring matter of brown meat gravies, and that our English cooks should use it far more liberally than they usually do. The preparation of sugar caramel is easy enough ; the sugar should be gradually heated till it assumes a rich brown colour and has lost its original sweetness. If

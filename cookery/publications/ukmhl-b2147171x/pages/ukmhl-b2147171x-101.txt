S9 FRYING. combined water of the original sugar, in the parting with which not only a change of colour occurs, but also a modification of flavour, as anybody may prove by experiment. When the temperature is gradually raised to 4200, the sugar loses two equivalents of water, and becomes caramel—a dark-brown substance, no longer sweet, but having a new flavour of its own. It further differs from sugar by being incapable of fermentation. The first stage of this cookery of sugar has now an archaeological interest in connection with one of the lost arts of the kitchen, viz. the 'spinning' of sugar. Within the reach of my own recollection no evening party could pretend to be stylish unless the supper-table was deco- rated with a specimen of this art—a temple, a pagoda, or something of the sort done in barley-sugar. These were made by raising the sugar to 3200, when it fused and became amorphous, or vitreous, as already described. The cook then dipped a skewer into it; the melted vitreous sugar adhered to this, and was drawn out as a thread, which speedily solidified by cooling, While in the act of solidification it was woven into the desired form, and the skilful artist did this with wonderful rapidity. I once witnessed with childish delight the spinning of a great work of art by the Duke of Cumber- land's French cook in St. James's Palace. It was a ship in full sail, the sails of edible wafer, the hull a basket- work of spun sugar, the masts of massive sugar-sticks, and the rigging of delicate threads of the same. As nearly as I can remember, the whole was completed in about an hour. But to return from high art below stairs to chemical science. The conversion of sugar into caramel is, as already stated, attended with a change of flavour; a

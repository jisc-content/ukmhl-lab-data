'59 FA T—MILK. similated at all—not laid down again as fat, but is used directly as fuel for the maintenance of animal heat. If this is correct, the advantage of the preliminary dis- sociation is more decided, for the combustible portion of the fat is its fatty acids ; the glycerine is an impediment to combustion, so much so that the modern candle-maker removes it, and thereby greatly improves the combusti- bility of his candles. It may be that the glycerine of the fat we eat is as- similated like sugar, while the fatty acids act directly as fuel. This view may reconcile some of the conflicting facts (such as the existence of fat in the carnivora) that stand in the way of the theory of the uses of fat food above referred to, according to which fat is not fattening, and those who would ' Bant' should eat fat freely to maintain animal heat, while very abstemious in the consumption of sugar and farinaceous food. The difference between tallow and dripping is in- structive. Their origin is the same ; both are melted fats—beef or mutton fats—and both contain the same fatty acids and glycerine, but there is a visible and tan- gible difference in their molecular condition. Tallow is smooth and homogeneous, dripping decidedly granular. I attribute this difference to the fact that in render- ing tallow, the heat is maintained no longer than is neces- sary to effect the fusion ; while, in the ordinary production of dripping, the fat is exposed in the dripping-pan to a long continuance of heat, besides being highly heated when used in basting. Therefore the dissociation is carried farther in the case of the dripping, and the result becomes sensible. I have observed that home-rendered lard, that ob- tained in English farmhouses, where the ' scratchings' {i.e. the membranous parts) are frizzled, is more granular

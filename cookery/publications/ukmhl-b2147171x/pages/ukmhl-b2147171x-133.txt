121 STEWING. to jump the basin with its steam. Stew thus for about double the time usually prescribed in English cookery- books, and compare the result with similar materials stewed in boiling or ' simmering' water. I have already (page 9 preferred to the frying that, in most cases, should precede stewing. It not only supplies the caramel browning there described, but mode- rates the extraction of the juices which, as I have said above, is desirable on the part of the meat itself when gravy is not the primary object. Some further explanation is here necessary, as it is quite possible to obtain what commonly passes for ten- derness by a very flagrant violation of the principles above expounded. This is done on a large scale and in extreme degree in the preparation of ordinary Australian tinned meat. A number .of tins are filled with the meat, and soldered down close, all but a small pin-hole. They are then placed in a bath charged with a saline sub- stance, such as chloride of zinc, which has a higher boiling point than water. This is heated up to its boiling point, and consequently the water which is in the tins with the meat boils vigorously, and a jet of steam mixed with air blows from the pin-hole. When all the air is expelled, and the jet is of pure steam only (a difference detected at once by the trained expert), the tin is removed, and a little melted solder skilfully dropped on the hole to seal the tin hermetically. An examination of one of these tins will show this final soldering with, in some, a flap below to prevent any solder from falling in amongst the meat. The object of this is to exclude all air, for if only a very small quan- tity remains, oxidation and putrefaction speedily ensues, as shown by a bulging of the tins instead of the partial

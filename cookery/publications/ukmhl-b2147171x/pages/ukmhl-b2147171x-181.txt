FAT—MILK. 169 ♦ simple application of the great principle of the conserva- tion of energy, whereby the burning of coal may be made to produce a degree of cold proportionate to the amount of heat it gives out in burning. Carcasses of sheep are thereby frozen to stony hard- ness immediately they are slaughtered in New Zealand and Australia, then packed in close .refrigerated cars, carried to-the ship, and there, stowed in chambers refri- gerated by the same means, and thus brought to.England in the same ' state of stony hardness as that originally produced. - I di.rfed-to'--day oh one of the legs of a sheep that r bought a: week-ago, and which was grazing at the Antipodes three months before. I prefer it to. any English mutton' ordinarily obtainable. The ground's of this preference will be understood when I explain that. English farmers, who manufacture mutton as a primary product, kill their sheep as soon as they are full grown, when a year old or less. They cannot afford to feed a sheep Tor two years longer merely to improve its flavour without adding to its weight. Country gentlemen, who do not. care for expense, occa- sionally regale their friends on a haunch or saddle of three-year-old mutton, as a rare and costly luxury. The Antipodean graziers are wool growers. Until lately mutton was merely used as manure, and even now it is but a secondary product. The wool crop improves year by year until the sheep is three or four years old ; therefore it is not slaughtered until this age is attained ; and thus the sheep sent to England are similar to those of the country squire, and such as the English farmer could not send to market under eighteenpence per pound. There is, however, one drawback; but I have tested it thoroughly (having supplied my own table during the last six months with no other mutton than that from

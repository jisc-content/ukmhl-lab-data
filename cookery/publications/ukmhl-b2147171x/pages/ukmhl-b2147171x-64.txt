THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. chop in equal halves, then hold one half over a flaming coal, immersing it in the flame, and thus cook it. Now- cut a bit of fat off the other, throw this fat on a surface of clear, glowing, flameless coal or coke, and, when a good blaze is thus obtained, immerse the half chop recklessly and unmercifully into this flame ; there let it splutter and fizz, let it drop more fat and make more flame, but hold it there nevertheless for a few minutes, and then taste the result. In spite of its blackness, it will be (if just warmed through to the above-named cooking temperature) a deliciously-cooked, juicy, nutritious, digestible morsel, apparently raw, but actually more completely cooked than if it had been held twice as long, at double the distance, from the surface of the fire. For further instruction, make a third experiment by imitating the cautious unscientific cook, who, ignorant of the difference between the condensation products of coal and those from beef and mutton fat, carefully raises the gridiron directly the flame from the dropping fat threatens the object of her solicitude. The result will be an ordinary domestic chop or steak. I apply this adjective, because in this particular effort of cookeiy, the grilling of chops and steaks, domestic cookery is commonly at fault. The majority of our City men find that while the joint cooked at home is better than that they usually get at restaurants and hotels, the chops and steaks are inferior. I believe that this inferiority is due, in the first place, to the want of understanding of the difference between coal-flame and fat-flame ; and in the second, to the ad- vantage afforded to the ' grill-room ' cook by his specially- constructed fire, with a large surface of glowing coke surmounted by a sloping grill, whereon he can expose

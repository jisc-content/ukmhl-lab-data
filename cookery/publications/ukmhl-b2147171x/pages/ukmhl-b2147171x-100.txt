ss THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. with agitation, the crystals are small, and the whole mass is a granular aggregation of crystals, such as we see in loaf sugar. If this crystalline sugar be heated to about 320° Fahr. it fuses, and without any change of chemical composition undergoes some sort of internal physical alteration that makes it cohere in a different fashion. (The learned name for this action is allotropism, and the substance is said to be allotropic, other conditioned ; or dimorphic, two-shaped). Instead of being crystalline the sugar now becomes vitreous, it solidifies as a transparent amber-coloured glass-like substance, the well-known barley-sugar, which differs from crystalline sugar not only in this respect, but has a much lower melting-point; it liquefies between 1900 and 212°, while loaf-sugar does not fuse below 3200. Left to itself, vitreous sugar returns gradually to its original condition, loses transparency, and breaks up into small crystals. In doing this it gives out the heat which during its vitreous condition had been doing the work of breaking up its crystalline structure, and therefore was not manifested as tempera- ture. This return to the crystalline condition is retarded by adding vinegar or mucilaginous matter to the heated sugar; hence the confectioners' name of ' barley-sugar,' which, in one of its old-fashioned forms, was prepared by boiling down ordinary sugar in a decoction of pearl barley. The French cooks and confectioners carry on the heating of sugar through various stages bearing different technical names, one of the most remarkable of which is a splendid crimson variety, largely used in fancy sweet- meats, and containing no foreign colouring matter, as commonly supposed. Though nothing is added, some- thing is taken away,.and this is some of the chemically-

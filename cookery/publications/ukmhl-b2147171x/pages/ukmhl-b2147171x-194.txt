THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. When heated to a little above 1400 Fahr., an absorp- tion of water takes place through the enveloping mem- brane of the granule, the grains swell up, and the mixture becomes pasty or viscous. If this paste be largely- diluted with water, the swollen granules still remain as separate bodies and slowly sink, though a considerable exosmosis of the true starch has occurred, as shown by the thickening of the water. I suppose that in their original state the enveloping membrane is much folded, and that these folds form the curious marking of con- centric rings which constitutes the characteristic micro- scopic structure of starch granules, and that when cooked, at the temperature named, the very delicate membrane becomes fully distended by the increased bulk of the hydrated and diluted starch, and thus the rings disappear. A very little mechanical violence, mere stirring, now breaks up these distended granules, and we obtain the starch paste so well known to the laundress, and to all who have seen cooked arrowroot. If this paste be dried by evaporation it does not regain its former insolubility, but readily dissolves in hot or cold water. This is what I should describe as cooked starch. If the heat is now raised from 1400 to the boiling point, and the boiling continued, the gelatinous mass becomes thicker and thicker ; and if there are more than fifty parts of water to one of starch a separation takes place, the starch settling down with its fifty parts of water, the excess of water standing above it. Care- fully dried starch may be heated to above 3000 without becoming soluble, but at400Â° a remarkable change com- mences. The same occurs to ordinary commercial starch at 3200, the difference evidently depending on the water retained by it. If the heat is continued a little beyond this it is converted into dextrin, otherwise named 'British

101 FRYING. cells, they burst, and the whole structure is puffed out to a most delicate lightness, far more suitable for fol- lowing solid meats than soddened fruit enveloped in heavy indigestible pudding-paste. Another advantage is that with proper apparatus (wire basket, kettle, and store of special fat) the fritters can be prepared and cooked in about one-tenth of the time demanded for the preparation and cookery of an apple pudding or pie. A few seconds of immersion in the fat-bath is sufficient. The fat used in frying requires occasional purification. I may illustrate the principle on which it should be con- ducted by describing the method adopted in the refining of mineral oils, such as petroleum or the paraffin distil- lates of bituminous shales. These are dark, tarry liquids of treacle-like consistency, with a strong and offensive odour. Nevertheless they are, at but little cost, converted into the 'crystal oil' used for lamps, and that beautiful pearly substance, the solid, translucent paraffin now so largely used in the manufacture of candles. Besides these, we obtain from the same dirty source an inter- mediate substance, the well-known ' Vaseline,' now be- coming the basis of most of the ointments of the pharmacopoeia. This purification is effected by agitation with sulphuric acid, which partly carbonises and partly combines with the impurities, and separates them in the form of a foul and acrid black mess, known technically as ' acid tar.' When I was engaged in the distillation of cannel and shale in Flintshire, this acid tar was a terrible bugbear. It found its way mysteriously into the Alyn river and poisoned the trout; but now, if I am correctly informed, the Scotch manufacturers have turned it to profitable account. Animal fat and vegetable oils are similarly purified. Very objectionable refuse fat of various kinds is thus

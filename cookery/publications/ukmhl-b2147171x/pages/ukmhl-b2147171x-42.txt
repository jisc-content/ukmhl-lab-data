THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 3Â° success I went home, rather out of humour at my ill success, and abandoned my shoulder of mutton to the cookmaids. ' It being late in the evening and the cookmaids thinking, perhaps, that the meat would be as safe in the drying machine as anywhere else, left it there all night. When they came in the morning to take it away, intend- ing to cook it for their dinner, they were much surprised at finding it already cooked, and not merely eatable, but perfectly well done, and most singularly well tasted. This appeared to them the more miraculous, as the fire under the machine was quite gone out before they left the kitchen in the evening to go to bed, and as they had locked up the kitchen when they left it, and taken away the key.

It was perfectly tender ; but though it was so much done it did not appear to be in the least sodden or insipid; on the contrary, it was uncommonly savoury and high flavoured.'

It will be still more so after what follows concerning the effect of heat on the other constituents of a shoulder of mutton. The Norwegian cooking apparatus, to which I have already alluded, and which is now commercially sup- plied in England, does its work in a somewhat similar manner. It consists of an inner tin pot with well-fitting

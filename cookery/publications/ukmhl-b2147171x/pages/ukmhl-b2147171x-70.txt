THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 58 up to above 2000 afterwards. I used loins and half-legs of mutton, exposing considerable surface. I find that Sir Henry Thompson, in a lecture de- livered at the Fisheries Exhibition, and now reprinted, has invaded my subject, and has done this so well that I shall retaliate by annexing his suggestion, which is that fish should be roasted. He says that this mode of cooking fish should be general, since it is applicable to all varieties. I fully agree with him, but go a little further in the same direction by including, not only roasting in a Dutch or American oven before the fire, but also in the side-ovens of kitcheners and in gas-ovens, which, when used as I have explained, are roastersâ€”i.e. they cook by radiation, without any of the drying anti- cipated by Sir Henry. The practical housewife will probably say this is not new, seeing that people who know what is good have long been in the habit of enjoying mackerel and had- docks (especially Dublin Bay haddocks) stuffed and baked, and cods' heads similarly treated. The Jews do something of the kind with halibut's head, which they prize as the greatest of all piscine delicacies. The John Dory is commonly stuffed and cooked in an oven by those who understand his merits. The excellence of Sir Henry Thompson's idea con- sists in its breadth as applicable to all fish, on the basis of that fundamental principle of scientific cookery on which I have so continually and variously insisted, viz. the re- tention and concentration of the natural juices of the viands. He recommends the placing of the fish entire, if of moderate size, in a tin or plated copper dish adapted to the form and size of the fish, but a little deeper than its thickness, so as to retain all the juices, which on exposure

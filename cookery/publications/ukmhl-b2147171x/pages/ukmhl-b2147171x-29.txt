THE BOILING OF WATER. 17 at Munich than at London. But if meat may without ■the least difficulty be cooked with a heat of 209^° at Munich, why should it not be possible to cook it with the same degree of heat in London ? If this can be done in London (which I think can hardly admit of a doubt), then it is evident that the process of cookery, which is called boiling, may be performed in water which is not boiling hot.' He proceeds to say, ' I well know, from my own ex- perience, how difficult it is to persuade cooks of this truth, but it is so important that no pains should be spared in endeavouring to remove their prejudices and enlighten their understandings. This may be done most effectually in the case before us by a method I have several times put in practice with complete success. It is as follows : Take two equal boilers, containing equal quantities of boiling hot water, and put into them two equal pieces of meat taken from the same carcase—two legs of mutton, for instance—and boil them during the same time. Under one of the boilers make a small fire, just barely sufficient to keep the water boiling hot, or rather just beginning to boil; under the other make as vehement a fire as possible, and keep the water boiling the whole time with the utmost violence. The meat in the boiler in which the water has been kept only just boiling hot will be found to be quite as well done as that in the other. It will even be found to be much better cooked, that is to say tenderer, more juicy, and much higher flavoured.' Rumford at this date (1802) understood perfectly that the water just boiling hot had the same temperature as that which was boiling with the utmost violence, but did not understand that the best result is obtained at a C

170 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. New Zealand), and find it so trifling as to be im- perceptible unless critically looked for. It is simply that, in thawing, a small quantity of the juice of the meat oozes out. This is more than compensated by the superior richness and fulness of flavour of the meat it- self, which is much darker in colour than young mutton. Legs of frozen mutton should be hung with the thick cut part upwards. With this precaution the loss of juice is but nominal. If the frozen sheep is not cut up until completely thawed and required for cooking there is no loss. Another successful method of meat-preserving has been more lately introduced. It is based upon the re- markable antiseptic properties of boric acid (or boracic acid as it is sometimes named) ; this is the characteristic constituent of borax, and, like the fatty acids above described, has no sour flavour. The speciality of this process, invented by Mr. Jones, a Gloucestershire surgeon, is the method by which a small quantity of the antiseptic is made to permeate the whole of the carcass. The animal is rendered insensible, either by a stun- ning blow or by an anaesthetic, with the heart still beat- ing. A vein—usually the jugular—is opened, and a small quantity of blood let out. Then a corresponding quantity of a solution of boric acid, raised to blood heat, is made to flow into the vein from a vessel raised to a suitable height above it. The action of the heart carries this through all the capillary vessels into every part of the body of the animal. The completeness of this diffu- sion may be understood by reflecting on the fact that we cannot puncture any part of the body with the point of a needle without drawing blood from some of these vessels.

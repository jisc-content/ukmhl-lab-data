3i8 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. stances, as 5071 grammes of water, 0-25 of a gramme of carbon, and 0-92 of a gramme of nitrogen. This amounts to 2\\ grammes of nitrogen per day in the insensible perspiration ; three-quarters of an ounce avoirdupois, or as much nitrogen as is contained in one pound and a half of natural living muscle. That the liquid perspiration contains compounds of nitrogen, and just such compounds as would result from the degradation of nitrogenous tissue, is unquestion- able. As Lehmann says (vol. ii. p. 389), ' the sweat very easily decomposes, and gives rise to the secondary for- mation of ammonia.' Simon and Berzelius found salts of ammonia in the sweat: that the ammonia is combined both with hydrochloric acid and with organic acids : that it probably exists as carbonate of ammonia in alkaline sweat. The existence of urea in sweat appears to be uncertain ; some chemists assert its presence, others deny it. Favre and Schottin, for example, who have both studied the subject very carefully, are at direct variance. I suspect that both are right, as its presence or absence is variable, and appears to depend on the condition of the subject of the experiment. Favre describes a special nitrogenous acid which he discovered in sweat, and names it liydrotic or sudoric acid. Its composition corresponds, according to his analysis, to the formula C10H8NO13. . I have summarised these facts, as they show clearly enough that conclusions based on an examination of the quantity of nitrogen excreted by the kidneys alone (and such is the sole basis of the modern theories), are of little or no value in determining whether or not muscular work- is accompanied with degradation of muscular tissue. The well-known fact that the total quantity of excretory

324 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. therefore it must be the wear and tear of the machine itself which supplies the working power, and not that of the food as mere fuel material shovelled directly into the animal furnace. I thus agree with Playfair, who says that the modern theory involves a 'false analogy of the animal body to a steam-engine,' and that' incessant transformation of the acting parts of the animal machine forms the condition for its action, while in the case of the steam- engine it is the transformation of fuel external to the machine which causes it to move.' Pavy says that ' Dr. Playfair, in these utterances, must be regarded as writing behind the time.' He may be behind as regards the fashion, but I think he is in advance as regards the truth. My readers, therefore, need not be ashamed of cling- ing to the old-fashioned belief that their own bodies are alive throughout, and perform all the operations of working, feeling, thinking, &c, by virtue of their own inherent self-contained vitality, and that in doing this they consume their own substance, which has to be per- petually replaced by new material, its quality depending upon the manner of working and the matter and manner of replacement. The course of our own evolution thus depends upon ourselves ; we may, according to our own daily conduct, be building up a better body and a better mind, or one that shall be worse than the fair promise of the original germ. Therefore the philosophy of the preparation of the material of which the body and brain are built up and renewed must be worthy of careful study. This philosophy is ' THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY.'

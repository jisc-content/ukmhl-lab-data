THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. The varying degrees are illustrated by the differences in a knuckle of veal or a calf's head, according to the length of time during which it has been stewed, i.e. subjected to the hydrating process. The second stage of the cookery of gelatin is the solution of this hydrate, as in soups, &c. Carpenters' glue is crude hydrated gelatin, made by stewing or hydrating hoofs of horses, cattle, &c, or the waste cuttings of hides. The carpenter knows that if he allows his solution of glue to boil (such a solution boils at a higher temperature than pure water), it loses its tenacity, becomes cindery, or, as I should say, dehy- drated or dissociated, without returning to the original condition of the organised membranes. Even a frequent reheating at the glue-pot tempera- ture ' weakens' the glue, and therefore he prefers fresh glue, and puts but a little at a time into his glue-pot. The applications of this theory will appear as I proceed. A sheep or an ox, a fowl or a rabbit, is made up, like ourselves, of organic structures and blood, the organs continually wasting as they work, and being renewed by the blood ; or, otherwise described, the component mole- cules of these organs are continually dying of old age as their work is done, and replaced by new-born successors generated by the blood. These molecules are, for the most part, cellular, each cell living a little life of its own, generated with a definite individuality, doing its own life-work, then shrivelling in decay, dying in the midst of vital surroundings, suffering cremation, and thereby contributing to the animal heat necessary for the life of its successors, and even giving up a portion of its substance to supply them with absorption-food. The cell walls are mainly composed of

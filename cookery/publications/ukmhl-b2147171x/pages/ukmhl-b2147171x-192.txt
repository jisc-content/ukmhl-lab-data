THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. be quite out of place here to discuss the theories of mole- cular constitution which such differences have suggested, especially as they are all rather cloudy. The percentage is--carbon 44-4, oxygen 494, and hydrogen 6"2. The difference between starch and cellulose that most closely affects my present subject, that of digestibility, is con- siderable. The ordinary food-forms of starch, such as arrowroot, tapioca, rice, &c, are among the most easily digestible kinds of food, while cellulose is peculiarly dif- ficult of digestion; in its crude and compact forms it is quite indigestible by human digestive apparatus. Neither of them are capable of sustaining life alone ; they contain none of the nitrogenous material required for building up muscle, nerve, and other animal tissue. They may be converted into fat, and may supply fuel for maintaining animal heat, and may possibly supply some of the energies demanded for organic work. Serious consequences have resulted from ignorance of this. The popular notion that anything which thickens to a jelly when cooked must be proportionally nutritious is very fallacious, and many a victim has died of starva- tion by the reliance of nurses on this theory, and con- sequently feeding an emaciated invalid on mere starch in the form of arrowroot, &c. The selling of a fancy variety at ten times its proper value has greatly aided this delusion, so many believing that whatever is dear must be good. I remember when oysters were retailed in London at fourpence per dozen. They were not then supposed to be exceptionally nutritious, were not pre- scribed by fashionable physicians to invalids, as they have been lately, since their price has risen to threepence each. More than half a century has elapsed since Dr. Beau- mont published the results of his experiments on Alexis

VEGETABLE CASEIN AND VEGETABLE JUICES. 219 solid matter remaining behind after filtering out the clear pea-soup ? Has the alkali acted in an opposite manner to the acid in the ripening pear ? Is it merely a fibrous refuse only fit for pig-food, or is it deserving of further attention in the kitchen ? Should it be treated with dilute acid—say a little vinegar—to break up the fibre, and thereby be made into good porridge ?

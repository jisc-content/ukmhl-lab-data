THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 62 cookery. The Italian peasantry are better fed than the French. In the poor osterias above referred to, not only the Friday salt fish, but all the other viands, were incom- parably better cooked than in corresponding places in England, and the variety was greater than is common in many middle-class houses. The ordinary supper of the ' roughs' above-named was of three courses: first, a ' mmestra,' i.e. a soup of some kind, continually varied, or a savoury dish of macaroni ; then a ragout or savoury stew of vegetables and meat, followed by an excellent salad ; the beverage, a flask of thin but genuine wine. When I come to the subject of cheese, I will describe their mode of cooking and using it. My first walk through Italy extended from the Alps to Naples, and from Messina to Syracuse. I thus spent nearly a year in Italy during a season of great abund- ance, and never saw a drunken Italian. A few years after this I walked through a part of Lombardy, and found the little osterias as bad as English beershops or low public-houses. It was a period of scarcity and trouble, 'the three plagues,' as they called them—the potato disease, the silkworm fungus, and the grape dis- ease—had brought about general privation. There was no wine at all; potato spirit and coarse beer had taken its place. Monotonous ' polenta,' a sort of paste or por- ridge made from Indian corn meal, to which they give the contemptuous name of ' miserable,' was then the general food, and much drunkenness was the natural consequence.

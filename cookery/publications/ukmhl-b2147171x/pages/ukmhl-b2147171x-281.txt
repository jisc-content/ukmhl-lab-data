269 THE COOKERY OF WINE. hours or days. We are indebted to Pasteur for the most legitimate—I might say the only legitimate- method of doing this. The process is accordingly called 'Pasteuring.' It consists in simply ^heating the wine to the temperature of 6o° C.= 1400 Fahr.,^ the temperature at which, as will be remembered, the visible changes in the cookery of animal food commences. It is worthy of note that this is also the exact temperature at which diastase acts most powerfully in converting starch into dextrin. Pasteuring is a process demanding considerable skill; no portion of the wine during its cookery must be raised above 1400, yet all must reach it; nor must it be exposed to the air. The apparatus designed by Rossignol is one of the best suited for this purpose. It is a large metallic vat or boiler with air-tight cover and a false bottom, from which rises a trumpet-shaped tube through the middle of the vat, and passing through an air-tight fitting in the cover. The chamber formed by the false bottom is filled with water by means of this tube, the object being to prevent the wine at the lower part from being heated directly by the fire which is below the water chamber. A thermometer is also inserted air- tight in the lid, with its bulb half-way down the vat. To allow for expansion a tube is similarly fitted into the lid. This is bent syphon-like, and its lower end dipped into a flask containing wine or water, so that air or vapour may escape and bubble through, but none enter. Even in drawing off from the vat the wine is not allowed to flow through the air, but is conveyed by a pipe which bends down, and dips to the bottom of the barrel. The apparatus is bulky and expensive. If heated with exposure to air, the wine acquires a flavour easily recognised as the 'go/It de cutt,' or flavour

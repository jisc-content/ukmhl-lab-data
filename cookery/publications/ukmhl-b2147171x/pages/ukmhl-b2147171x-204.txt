192 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. tenant should plant them they would suggest luxury and prosperity, and therefore a rise of rent; or other- wise stated, the tenant would be fined for thus improving the value of his holding. This was before the passing of the Land Act, which we may hope will put an end to such legalised brigandage. With the abolition of rack- renting the Irish peasant may grow and eat fruit ; may even taste jam without fear and trembling; may grow rhubarb and make pies and puddings in defiance of the agent. When this is the case, his craving for potato- potash will probably diminish, and his children may actually feed on bread. I have been told by an American lady that in the fatherland of potatoes, as well as in their adopted country, they are always boiled or steamed in their jackets : that American cooks, like those of Ireland, would consider it an outrage to cut off the protecting skin of the potato before cooking it; that they are more commonly mashed there than here, and that the mashing is done by rapidly removing the skins and throwing the stripped potato into a supplementary saucepan or other vessel, in which they may be kept hot until the preparation is completed. As regards the nutritive value of the potato, it is well to understand that the common notion concerning its cheapness as an article of food is a fallacy. Taking Dr. Edward Smith's figures, 760 grains of carbon and 24 grains of nitrogen are contained in 1 lb. of potatoes; 2\ lbs. of potatoes are required to supply the amount of carbon contained in 1 lb. of bread ; and 3^ lbs. of potatoes are necessary for supplying the nitrogen of 1 lb. of bread. With bread at \\d. per lb., potatoes should cost less than \d. per lb. in order to be as cheap as bread for the hard- working man who requires an abundance of nitrogenous food.

FATâ€”MILK. After the completion of this circulation the animal is bled to death in the usual manner. From three to four ounces of boric acid is sufficient for a sheep of average weight, and much of this comes away with the final bleeding. On April 2, 1884, I made a hearty meal on the roasted, boiled, and stewed flesh of a sheep that was killed on February 8, the carcass hanging in the mean- time in the basement of the Society of Arts. It was perfectly fresh, and without any perceptible flavour of the boric acid : very tender, and full-flavoured as fresh meat. On July 19, 1884, I purchased a haunch of the prepared mutton, and hung it in an ill-constructed larder during the excessively hot weather that followed. On August 10, after twenty-two days of this severe ordeal, it was still in good condition. The nth and 12th were two of the hottest days of the present century in England. On the 13th 1 examined the haunch very carefully, and detected symptoms of giving way. It had become softer, and was pervaded throughout with a slight mal- odour. On the 14th it became worse, and then I had it roasted. It was decidedly gamey ; the fat, or rather the membranous junction between fat and lean, and the membranous sheaths of the muscles had succumbed, but the substance of the muscles, the firm lean parts of the meat, were quite eatable, and eaten by myself and other members of my family. There was no taste of boric acid, and the meat was unusually tender. The curious element of this process is the very small quantity of the boric acid which does the work so effect- ually. For some time past most of the milk that is supplied to London has been similarly treated by adding borax or a preparation chiefly composed of borax, and named ' glacialine.' This suppresses the incipient lactic fer-

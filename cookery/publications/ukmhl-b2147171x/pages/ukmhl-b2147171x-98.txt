THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. sr, vapour of lard, but vapour of separated and recombined constituents of the lard, which is now suffering dis- sociation, the volatile products passing off while the non-volatile carbon (i.e. lard-charcoal) remains behind, colouring the liquid. If the heating be continued, a residuum of this carbon, in the form of soft coke or char- coal, will be all that remains in the heated vessel. We may now understand what happens when some- thing humid—say a sole—is put into a frying-pan which contains fat heated above 212°. Water, when suddenly heated above its boiling-point, is a powerful explosive, and may be very dangerous, simply because it expands to 1,728 times its original bulk when converted into steam. Steam-engine boilers and the boilers of kitchen stoves sometimes explode by becoming red-hot while dry, and then receiving a little water which suddenly expands to steam. The noise and spluttering that is started immediately the sole is immersed in the hot fat is due to the explo- sion of a multitude of small bubbles formed by the con- finement of the suddenly expanding steam in the viscous fat, from which it releases itself with a certain degree of violence. It is evident that to effect this amount of eruptive violence, the temperature must be considerably above the boiling-point of the exploding water. If it were only just at the boiling-point, the water would boil quietly. As we all know, the flavour and appearance of a boiled sole or mackerel are decidedly different from those of a fried sole or mackerel, and it is easy to under- stand that the different results of these cooking processes are to some extent due to the difference of temperature to which the fish is subjected. It will be at once under- stood that my theory of the chief difference between

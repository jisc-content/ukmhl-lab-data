CHEESE. 133 di ricotta >), it is sold for about twopence per pound, or less. There is a discrepancy in the published analyses of casein which demands explanation here, as it is of great practical importance. They generally correspond to the above of Mulder within small fractions, as shown below in those of Scherer and Dumas : Scherer Dumas Carbon 54*65 537 Hydrogen 7'465 7'2 Nitrogen 15724 l6"6 Oxygen, sulphur .... 22-146 22'5 100'OOO IOO'O In these the 100 parts are made up without any phos- phate of lime, while, according to Lehmann (' Physio- logical Chemistry,' vol. i. p. 379, Cavendish Edition), â€¢ casein that has not been treated with acids contains about 6 per cent, of phosphate of lime ; more, conse- quently, than is contained in any of the protein com- pounds we have hitherto considered.' From this it appears that we may have casein with, and casein without, this necessary constituent of food. In precipitating casein for laboratory analysis, acids are commonly used, and thus the phosphate of lime is dis- solved out; but I am unable at present to tell my readers the precise extent to which this actually occurs in practical cheese-making where rennet is used. What I have at present learned only indicates generally that this constituent of cheese is very variable ; and I hereby suggest to those chemists who are professionally con- 1 I am greatly disgusted with the cookery-books, especially the pre- tentious volume of Francatelli's, on being unable to find any recipe for this delicious Italian dish, and a similar absence of a dozen or two of equally common and excellent preparations familiar to all who have dined at the Lepre (Rome), or other good Italian restaurants.

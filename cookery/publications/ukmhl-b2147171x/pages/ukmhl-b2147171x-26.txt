14 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. held boiling water as boiled copper or boiled iron. No boiling of the food takes place in any such cases as the above-named—it is merely heated by immersion in boiling water ; the changes that actually take place in the food are essentially different from those of ebulli- tion. Even the water contained in the meat is not boiled in ordinary cases, as its boiling-point is higher than that of the surrounding water, owing to the salts it holds in solution. Thus, as a matter of chemical fact, a ' boiled leg of mutton ' is one that has been cooked, but not boiled ; while a roasted leg of mutton is one that has been par- tially boiled. Much of the constituent water of flesh is boiled out, fairly driven away as vapour during roasting or baking, and the fat on its surface is also boiled, and, more or less, dissociated into its chemical elements, car- bon and water, as shown by the browning, due to the separated carbon. As I shall presently show, this verbal explanation is no mere verbal quibble, but it involves important prac- tical applications. An enormous waste of precious fuel is perpetrated every day, throughout the whole length and breadth of Britain and other countries where English cookery prevails, on account of the almost universal ignorance of the philosophy of the so-called boiling of food. When it is once fairly understood that the meat is not to be boiled, but is merely to be warmed by immer- sion in water raised to a maximum temperature of 212°, and when it is further. understood that water cannot (under ordinary atmospheric pressure) be raised to a higher temperature than 212° by any amount of violent boiling, the popular distinction between 'simmering'

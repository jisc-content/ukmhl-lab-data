[ IO THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. I should add, in reference to the seed-oils, that there is a possible objection to their use as frying media. Oils extracted from seeds contain more or less of lino- leine (so named from its abundance in linseed oil), which, when exposed to the air, combines with oxygen, swells and dries. If the oil from cotton-seed or poppy-seed con- tains too much of this, it will thicken inconveniently when kept for a length of time exposed to the air Palm oil is practically free from it, but I am doubtful respecting palm-nut oil, as most of the nut oils are ' driers.' Extravagant cooks delude confiding mistresses by de- manding butter for ordinary frying. A veneration for costliness is one of the vulgar vices, especially dominant below stairs. In many cases a worse motive induces the denunciation of the dripping and skimmed fat recom- mended by Gouff6 as above, and the substitution of lard or butter for it. This is the practice of selling the drip- ping as ' kitchen stuff.'

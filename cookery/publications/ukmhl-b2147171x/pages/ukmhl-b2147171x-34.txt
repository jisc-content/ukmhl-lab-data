22 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. discovered by our test-tube experiment to the cooking of a breakfast egg. The non-professional student may do this at the breakfast fireside. The apparatus required is a saucepan large enough for boiling a pint of water— the materials, two eggs. Cook one in the orthodox manner by keeping it in boiling water three-and-a-half minutes. Then place the other in this same boiling water ; but, instead of keeping the saucepan over the fire, place it on the hearth and leave it there, with the egg in it, about ten minutes or more. A still better way of making the comparative experiment is to use, for the second egg, a water-bath, or bain-marie of the French cook—a vessel immersed in boiling, or nearly boiling water, like a glue-pot, and therefore not quite so hot as its source of heat. In this case a thermometer should be used, and the water surrounding the egg be kept at or near 180° Fahr. Time of immersion about ten or twelve minutes. A comparison of results will show that the egg that has been cooked at a temperature of more than 300 below the boiling-point of water is tender and delicate, evenly so throughout, no part being hard while another part is semi-raw and slimy. I said ' ten minutes or more,' because, when thus cooked, a prolonged exposure to the hot water does no mischief; if the temperature of 1600 is not exceeded, it may remain twice as long without hardening. The 1800 is above-named because the rising of the temperature of the egg itself is due to the difference between its own temperature and that of the water, and when that differ- ence is very small, this takes place very slowly, besides which the temperature of the water is, of course, lowered in raising that of the cold egg. In order to test this principle severely, I made the

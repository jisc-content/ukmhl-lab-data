THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. nutrition, which is but a few degrees worse than partial starvation. My typical cheese-porridge is ordinary oatmeal-por- ridge made in the usual manner, but to which grated cheese, or some of the cheese solution above described, is added, either while in the cookery-pot or after it is taken out, and yet as hot as possible. It should be sprinkled gradually and well stirred in. Another kind of cheese-porridge or cheese-pudding is made by adding cheese to baked potatoesâ€”the potatoes to be taken out of their skins and well mashed while the grated cheese is sprinkled and intermingled. A little milk may or may not be added, according to taste and convenience. This is better suited for those whose oc- cupations are sedentary, potatoes being less nutritious and more easily digested than oatmeal. They are chiefly composed of starch, which is a heat-giver or fattener, while the cheese is highly nitrogenous, and supplies the elements in which the potato is deficient, the two to- gether forming a fair approach to the theoretically demanded balance of constituents. I say baked potatoes rather than boiled, and perhaps should explain my reasons, though in doing so I anti- cipate what I shall explain more fully when on the subject of vegetable food. Raw potatoes contain potash salts which are easily soluble in water. I find that when the potato is boiled some of the potash comes out into the water, and thus the vegetable is robbed of a very valuable constituent. The baked potato contains all its original saline con- stituents which, as I have already stated, are specially demanded as an addition to cheese-food. Hasty pudding made, as usual, of wheat flour, may be converted from an insipid to a savoury and highly

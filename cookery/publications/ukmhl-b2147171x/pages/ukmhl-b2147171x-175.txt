FAT—MILK. 163 milk becomes acid. This assists in the separation of the cream. Butter is merely the oil globules aggregated by- agitation or churning. The condition of the casein has been already described. The sugar of milk or ' lactine ' is much less sweet than cane sugar. The cookery of milk is very simple, but by no means unimportant. That there is an appreciable difference between raw and boiled milk may be proved by taking equal quantities of each (the boiled sample having been allowed to cool down), adding them to equal quantities of the same infusion of coffee, then critically tasting the mixtures. The difference is sufficient to have long since established the practice among all skilful cooks of scru- pulously using boiled milk for making cafe an lait. I have tried a similar experiment on tea, and find that in this case the cold milk is preferable. Why this should be—why boiled milk should be better for coffee and raw milk for tea—I cannot tell. If any of my readers have not done so already, let them try similar experiments with condensed milk, and I have no doubt that the ver- dict of the majority will be that it is passable with coffee, but very objectionable in tea. This is milk that has been very much cooked. The chief definable alteration effected by the boiling of milk is the coagulation of the small quantity of albu- men which it contains. This rises as it becomes solidified, carrying with it some of the fat globules of the milk, and a little of its sugar and saline constituents, thus forming a skin-like scum on the surface, which may be lifted with a spoon and eaten, as it is perfectly wholesome, and very nutritious.

COUNT RUMFORD'S ROASTER. 75 This was an eloquent experiment; the gain of 6 per cent, tells of juices retained with consequent gain of flavour, tenderness, and digestibility, and the subsequent testimony of the scraps describes the difference in the condition of the tendonous, integumentary portions of the joints, which are just those that present the toughest practical problems to the cook, especially in roasting. But why are these roasters not in general use ? Why did they die with their inventor, notwithstanding the fact, mentioned in his essay, that Mr. Hopkins, of Greek Street, Soho, had sold above 200, and others were making them ? Those of my readers who have had practical ex- perience in using hot air or in superheating steam, will doubtless have already detected a weak point in the ' blowpipes.' When iron pipes are heated to redness, or thereabouts, and a blast of air or steam passes through them, they work admirably for a while, but presently the pipe gives way, for iron is a combustible substance, and burns slowly when heated and supplied with abun- dant oxygen, either by means of air or water ; the latter being decomposed, its hydrogen set free, while its oxygen combines with the iron, and reduces it to friable oxide. Rumford does not appear to have understood this, or he would have made his blowpipes of fire-clay or other refractory non-oxidisable material. The records of the Great Seal Office contain specifica- tions of hundreds of ingenious inventions that have failed most vexatiously from this defect; and I could tell of joint-stock companies that have been 'floated' to carry out inventions involving the use of heated air or super- heated steam that have worked beautifully and with apparent economy while the shares were in the market, and then collapsed just when the calls were paid up, the

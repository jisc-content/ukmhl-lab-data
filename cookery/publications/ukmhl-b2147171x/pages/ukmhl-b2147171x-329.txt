THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION. 317 amounted to 1327 grammes, or nearly 4$ times as much as during repose. A robust man, taking violent exercise in hot weather, may give off as much as 5 lbs. in an hour. The third excretion from the skin, the epithelial or superficial scales of the epidermis, is small in weight, but it is solid, and of similar composition to gelatin. It should be understood that this increases largely with exercise. The practice of sponging and ' rubbing down ' of athletes removes the excess ; but I am not aware of any attempt that has been made to determine accurately the quantity thus removed. Does the skin excrete nitrogenous matter that may be, like urea, a product of the degradation or destruction of muscular tissue? The following passage from Lehmann's' Physiological Chemistry' (vol. ii. p. 389), shows that the skin throws out plenty of nitrogen obtained from somewhere : ' It has been shown by the experiments of Milly, Jurine, Ingen- houss, Spallanzani, Abernethy, Barruel, and Collard di Martigny, that gases, and especially carbonic acid and nitrogen, are likewise exhaled with the liquid secretion of the sudiparious glands. According to the last-named experimentalist the ratio between these two gases is very variable; thus, in the gas developed after vegetable food there is a preponderance of carbonic acid, and, after animal food, there is an excess of nitrogen. Abernethy found that on an average the collective gas contained rather more than two-thirds of carbonic acid and rather less than one-third of nitrogen.' But it appears that less gas is exhaled when there is much liquid perspiration. Lehmann's summary of the experiments of Aber- nethy, Brunner, and Valentin (vol. ii. p. 391), gives the amount of hourly exudation, under ordinary circum-

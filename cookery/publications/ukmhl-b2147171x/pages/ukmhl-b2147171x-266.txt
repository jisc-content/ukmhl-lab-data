254 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. But how about the previous ' scientific researches ' of Lehmann, who, on all such subjects, is about the highest authority that can be quoted. His three volumes on ' Physiological Chemistry,' translated and republished by the Cavendish Society, stand pre-eminent as the best- written, most condensed, and complete work on the sub- ject, and his original researches constitute a lifetime's work, not of mere random change-ringing among the elements of obscure and insignificant organic compounds, but of judiciously selected chemical work, having definite philosophical aims and objects. It is evident from the passages I have emphatically quoted that Dr. Smith flatly contradicts Lehmann, and arrives at directly contradictory physiological results and practical inferences. Are we, therefore, to conclude that he has blundered in his analysis, or that Lehmann has done so ? On carefully comparing the two sets of investiga- tions, I conclude that there is no necessary contradiction in the facts: that both may be, and in all probability are, quite correct as regards their chemical results ; but that Dr. Smith has only attacked half the problem, while Lehmann has grasped the whole. All the popular stimulants, refreshing drugs, and * pick-me-ups' have two distinct and opposite actionsâ€” an immediate exaltation which lasts for a certain period, varying with the drug and the constitution of its victim, and a subsequent depression proportionate to the primary exaltation, but, as I believe, always exceeding it either in duration or intensity, or both, thus giving as a nett or mean result a loss of vitality. Dr. Smith's experiments only measured the car- bonic acid exhaled from the lungs during the first stage, the period of exaltation. His experiments

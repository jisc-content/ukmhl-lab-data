i44 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY the more soluble. Some that I have tried leave a stub- bornly insoluble residuum, which is detestably tough. I found the same cheese to be unusually indigestible when eaten with bread in the ordinary raw state, and have reason to believe that it is what I have called ' bosch cheese,' to be described presently. The successful solution, in either alkalised milk or alkalised water, cools into a custard-like mass, the thick- ness or viscosity varying, of course, with the quantity of solvent. It may be kept for use a short time (from two or three days to two or three weeks, according to the weather), after which it becomes putrescent. As now well known to all concerned, a great deal of ' butterine,' or ' oleomargarine,' or ' margarine,' or ' bosch,' is made by extracting from the waste fat of oxen and sheep some of its harder constituents, the palmitic and stearic acids, then working up the softer remainder with a little milk, or even without the milk, into a resemblance to butter. When properly prepared and honestly sold for what it is, no fair grounds for objection exist; but it is too commonly sold for what it is notâ€”i.e. as butter. For cookery purposes a fair sample of ' bosch' is quite as good as ' inferior dosset.' I have tasted some that is scarcely distinguishable from best Devonshire fresh. More recently this enterprise has been further de- veloped. Genuine butter is made from cream skimmed from the milk. The skimmed milk is then curdled, and to the whey thus precipitated a sufficient quantity of bosch is added to replace the butter that has been sent to market. A still more objectionable compound is made by using hogs' lard as a substitute for the natural cream. These extraneous fats render the cheese more indigestible. The curd precipitated from skim milk is harder and tougher than that thrown down from whole

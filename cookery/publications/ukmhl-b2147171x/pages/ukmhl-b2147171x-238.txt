226 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. substitutes are sold in Constantinople. The same as regards the sherbet. I conclude this part of my subject by re-echoing Mr. Gladstone's advocacy of the extension of fruit culture. We shamefully neglect the best of all food, in eating and drinking so little fruit. As regards cooked fruit, I say jam for the million, jelly for the luxurious, and juice for all. With these in abundance, the abolition of alcoholic drinks will follow as a necessary result of natural nausea. I may add that besides the letters asking for the further information here given, I have since received several others from readers who have adopted the diet above prescribed with good practical results. I have further learned that vegetarians are remark- ably free from the lithic acid troubles above named, and that many who were sufferers before they became vege- tarians have subsequently escaped. The testimony of a large number is demanded in such subjects, as individual examples may depend upon individual peculiarities of constitution.

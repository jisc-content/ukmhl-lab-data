They cut their roll into ' fingers,' and dip it in the ' aurora' instead of spreading butter on it. Vegetable food generally contains an excess of cel- lulose and a deficiency of fat; therefore cocoa, with its excess of fat and deficiency of cellulose, is theoretically indicated as a very desirable adjunct to an ordinary vegetarian dietary. The few experiments I have made by perpetrating the culinary heresy of adding cocoa to oatmeal-porridge and other purges, to mashed potatoes, turnips, carrots, boiled rice, sago, tapioca, &c, prove that vegetarians have much to learn in the cookery of cocoa. During two months' sojourn in Milan my daily breakfast consisted of bread, grapes, and powdered chocolate. Each grape was bitten across, one-half eaten pure and simple, then the cut and pulpy face of the other half was dipped in the chocolate powder, and eaten with as much as adhered to it. I have never been better fed.

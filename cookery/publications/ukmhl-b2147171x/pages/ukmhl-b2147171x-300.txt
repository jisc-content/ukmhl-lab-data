288 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY, which special tests have been devised by French and German chemists: Beet-root, peach-wood, elderberries, mulberries, log- wood, privet-berries, litmus, ammoniacal cochineal, Fer- nambucca-wood, phytolacca, burnt sugar, extract of rhatany, bilberries; 'jerupiga' or 'geropiga,' a 'com- pound of elder juice, brown sugar, grape juice, and crude Portuguese brandy' (for choice tawny port) ; 'tincture of saffron, turmeric, or safflower' (for golden sherry) ; red poppies, mallow flowers, &c. Those of my readers who have done anything in practical chemistry are well acquainted with blue and red litmus, and the general fact that such vegetable colours change from blue to red when exposed to an acid, and return to blue when the acid is overcome by an alkali. The colouring matter of the grape is one of these. Mulder and Maumene have given it the name of oznocyan or wine-blue, as its colour, when neutral, is blue ; the red colour of genuine wines is due to the presence of tartaric and acetic acid acting upon the wine-blue. There are a few purple wines, their colour being due to unusual absence of acid. The original vintage which gave celebrity to port wine is an example of this. The bouquet of wine is usually described as due to the presence of ether, oenanthic ether, which is naturally formed during the fermentation of grape juice, and is itself a variable mixture of other ethers, such as caprilic, caproic, &c. The oil of the seed of the grape contri- butes to the bouquet. The fancy values of fancy wines are largely due, or more properly speaking were largely due, to peculiarities of bouquet. These peculiar wines became costly because their supply was limited, only a certain vineyard, in some cases of very small area, pro- ducing the whole crop of the fancy article. The high

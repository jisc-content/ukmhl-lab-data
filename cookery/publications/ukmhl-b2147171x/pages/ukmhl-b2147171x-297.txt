THE COOKERY OF WINE. 285 the fact that the phylloxera destroyed all the claret grapes in certain districts of France, without stopping the manufacture or diminishing the export of claret itself. In this paper, by J. Lefort, we are told, as a matter of course, that 'owing to the ravages of the phylloxera among the vines, substitutes for grape-juice are being introduced for the manufacture of wines ; of these, the author specially condemns the use of beet- root sugar, since, during its fermentation, besides ethyl alcohol and aldehyde, it yields propyl, butyl, and amyl alcohols, which have been shown by Dujardin and Audige to act as poisons in very small quantities.' In connection with this subject I may add that the French Government carefully protects its own citizens by rigid inspection and analysis of the wines offered for sale to French wine-drinkers ; but does not feel bound to expend its funds and energies in hampering commerce by severe examination of the wines that are exported to ' John Bull et son lie,' especially as John Bull is known to have a robust constitution. Thus, vast quantities of brilliantly coloured liquid, flavoured with orris root, which would not be allowed to pass the barriers of Paris, but must go somewhere, is drunk in England at a cost of four times as much as the Frenchman pays for genuine grape-wine. The coloured concoction being brighter, skilfully cooked, and duly labelled to imitate the pro- ducts of real or imaginary celebrated vineyards, is pre- ferred by the English gourmet to anything that can be made from simple grape-juice. I should add that a character somewhat similar to that of natural dryness is obtained by mixing with the grape-juice wine a secondary product, obtained by add- ing water to the marc {i.e. the residue of skins, &c, that remains after pressing out the must or juice) ; a minimum

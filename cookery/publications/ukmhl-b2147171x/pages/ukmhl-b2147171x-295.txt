THE COOKERY OE WINE. imitation of the natural salinity of the dry wine by the addition of factitious salts and fortifying with alcohol. The sugar remains, but is disguised thereby. It was a wine thus treated that first brought the subject of the sulphates, already referred to, under my notice. It con- tained a considerable quantity of sugar, but was not perceptibly sweet. It was very strong and decidedly acid; contained free sulphuric acid and alum, which, as all who have tasted it know, gives a peculiar sense of dryness to the palate. The sulphuring, plastering, and use of Spanish earth increase the dryness of a given wine by adding mineral acid and mineral salts. In a paper recently read be- fore the French Academy by L. Magnier de la Source (' Comptes Rendus,' vol. xcviii. page no), the author states that ' plastering modifies the chemical characters of the colouring matter of the wine, and not only does the calcium sulphate decompose the potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar), with formation of calcium tartrate, potassium sulphate, and free tartaric acid, but it also decomposes the neutral organic compounds of potassium which exist in the juice of the grape.' I quote from abstract in ' Journal of the Chemical Society' of May 1884. In the French ' Journal of Pharmaceutical Chemistry,' vol. vi. pp. 118-123 (1882), is a paper, by P. Carles, in which the chemical and hygienic results of plastering are discussed. His general conclusion is, that the use of gypsum in clearing wines ' renders them hurtful as beverages;' that the gypsum acts ' on the potassium bitartrate in the juice of the grape, forming calcium tar- trate, tartaric acid, and potassium sulphate, a large pro- portion of the last two bodies remaining in the wine.' Unplastered wines contain about two grammes of free

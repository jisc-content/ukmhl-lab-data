We require, without altogether suppressing this adhesiveness, to interpose a barrier that shall sunder these millions of particles from each other so delicately as neither to separate them completely nor allow them to completely adhere. It is evident that, if the operation that supplies each particle with its film of moisture can simultaneously supply it with a partial atmosphere of gaseous matter, the difficult and delicate problem will be effectively solved. It is thus solved in making bread. As already explained, the seed which is broken up into flour contains diastase as well as starch, and this diastase, when aided by moisture and moderate warmth, converts the starch into dextrin and sugar. This ac- tion commences when the dough is made ; this alone would only increase the adhesiveness of the mass, if it went no further, but the sugar thus produced may, by the aid of a suitable ferment, be converted into alcohol. As the composition of alcohol corresponds to that of sugar, minus carbonic acid, the evolution of carbonic acid gas is an essential part of this conversion. With these facts before us, their practical application in bread-making is easily understood. To the water with which the flour is to be moistened some yeast is added, and the yeast-cells, which are very much smaller than the grains of flour, are diffused throughout the water. The flour is moistened with this liquid, which only demands a temperature of about 70Â° Fahr. to act with considerable energy on every granule of flour that it touches. Instead, then, of the passive, lumpy, tena- cious dough produced by moistening the flour with mere

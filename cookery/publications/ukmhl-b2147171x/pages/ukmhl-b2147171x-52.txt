4o THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. absence of alcohol, of which very little can remain in such preparations, but rather to the absence of the flavouring ingredients of the wine. I venture to suggest the further, deliberate, and scientific extension of this principle, by adding to bone- soup, or other form of insipid gelatin, the potash, salts, phosphates, &c, which are found in the juices of meat and vegetables. They may either be prepared in the manufacturing laboratory, like Parrish's ' Chemical Food,' or 'Syrup of phosphates,' or extracted from fruits, as commercial limejuice is extracted. I recommend those who are interested to manufacture and offer for sale a good preparation of limejuice gelatin. It would seem that gelatin alone, although contain- ing the elements required for nutrition, requires some- thing more to render it digestible. We shall probably be not far from the truth if we picture it to the mind as something too smooth, too neutral, too inert, to set the digestive organs at work, and that it therefore requires the addition of a decidedly sapid something that shall make these organs act. I believe that the proper function of the palate is to determine our selection of such ma- terials ; that its activity is in direct sympathy with that of all the digestive organs ; and that if we carefully avoid the vitiation of our natural appetites, we have in our mouths, and the nervous apparatus connected there- with, a laboratory that is capable of supplying us with information concerning some of the chemical relations of food which is beyond the grasp of the analytical machinery of the ablest of our scientific chemists. What is the chemistry of the cookery of gelatin? What are the chemical changes effected by cookery upon gelatin ? Or, otherwise stated, what is the chemical difference or differences between cooked and raw gelatin ?

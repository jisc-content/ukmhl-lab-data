ALBUMEN. random to the cookery-books that come first to hand, I find them about equally divided on the question. Confining our attention at present to the albumen, what must happen if the fish or flesh is put in cold water, which is gradually heated ? Obviously a loss of albumen by exudation and diffusion through the water, especially in the case of sliced fish or of meat exposing much surface of fibres cut across. It is also evident that such loss of albumen will be shown by its coagulation when the water is sufficiently heated. Practical readers will at once recognise in the ' scum ' which rises to the surface of the boiling water, and in the milkiness that is more or less diffused throughout it, the evidence of such loss of albumen. This loss indicates the desirability of plunging the fish or flesh at once into water hot enough to immediately coagulate the super- ficial albumen, and thereby plug the pores through which the inner albuminous juice otherwise exudes. But this is not all. There are other juices besides the albumen ; these are the most important of the flav- ouring constituents, and, zvith the other constituents of animal food, have great nutritive value ; so much so, that animal food is quite tasteless and almost worthless with- out them. I have laid especial emphasis on the above qualification, lest the reader should be led into an error originated by the bone-soup committee of the French Academy, and propagated widely by Liebigâ€”that of regarding these juices as a concentrated nutriment when taken alone. They constitute collectively the extractum carnis, which, with the addition of more or less gelatine (the less the better), is commonly sold as Liebig's ' Extract of Meat' It is prepared by simply mincing lean

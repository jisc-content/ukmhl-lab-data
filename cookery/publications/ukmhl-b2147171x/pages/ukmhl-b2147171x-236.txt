224 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY of the grape, thrown down in the manner I shall describe when on the subject of the cookery of wines. At the risk of being accused of presumption, I must here protest, as a chemist, against one of ' the fallacies of the faculty,' or of certain members of the faculty, viz. that of indiscriminately prohibiting to gouty and rheumatic patients the use of acids or anything having an acid taste. This has probably arisen from experience of the fact that mineral acids do serious mischief, and that alkaline carbonate of potash affords relief. The difference be- tween the organic acids, which are decomposed in the manner I have described, and the fixed composition of the mineral acids, does not appearto have been sufficiently studied by those who prohibit fruit and vegetables on account of their acidity. It must never be forgotten that nearly all the organic compounds of potash, as they exist in vegetables and fruit, are acid. It may be desirable, in some cases, to add a little bicarbonate of potash to neutralise this excess of acid and increase the potash supply. I have found it advantageous to throw a half-saltspoonful of this into a tumbler of water con- taining the juice of a lemon, and have even added it to stewed or baked rhubarb and gooseberries. In these it froths like whipped cream, and diminishes the demand for sugar, an excess of which appears to be mischievous to those who require much potash. I must conclude this sermon on the potash text by adding that it is quite possible to take an excess of this solvent. Such excess is depressing ; its action is what is called ' lowering.' I will not venture upon an expla- nation of the rationale of this lowering, or discuss the question of whether or not the blood is made watery, as sometimes stated.

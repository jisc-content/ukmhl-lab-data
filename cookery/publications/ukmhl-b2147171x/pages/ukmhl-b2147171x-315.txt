At agricultural meetings throughout the country the iniqui- tous malt-tax was eloquently denounced because it stood in the way of this great fodder reform. Then the malt- tax was repealed, and forthwith the subject fell out of hearing. Why was this ? The idea of malt feeding was theoretically sound. By the malting of barley or other grain its diastase is made to act upon its insoluble starch, and to convert this more or less completely into soluble dextrin, a change which is absolutely necessary as a part of the business of digestion. Therefore, if you feed cattle on malted grain instead of raw grain, you supply them with a food so prepared that a part of the business of digestion is already done for them, and their nutrition is thereby advanced.

274 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. pure crystals of cream of tartar, but of minute particles carrying with it some colouring matter, extractives, &c, and thus spoiling the brilliancy of the wine, making it more or less turbid. But this is not all. Boiling water dissolves Â£th of its weight of cream of tartar, cold water only j^th, and, at intermediate tempe atures, intermediate quantities. Therefore, if we lower the temperature of a saturated solution, precipitation occurs. Hence, the sickening of wine due to change of cellars or change of climate, even when no further fermentation occurs. The lighter the wine, i.e. the less alcohol it contains naturally, the more tartrate it contains, and the greater the liability to this source of sickness. This, then, is the temporary sickness to which I have referred. I have proved the truth of this theory by filtering such sickened wine through laboratory filter- ing paper, thereby rendering it transparent, and obtaining on the paper all the guilty disturbing matter. I found it to be a kind of argol, but containing a much larger pro- portion of extractive and colouring matter, and a smaller proportion of tartrate than the argol of commerce. I operated upon rich new Catalan wine. This brings me at once to the source or origin of a sort of wine-cookery by no means so legitimate as the Pasteuring already described, as it frequently amounts to serious adulteration. The wine-merchants are here the victims of their customers, who demand an amount of transparency that is simply impossible as a permanent condition of unsophisticated grape-wine. To anybody who has any knowledge of the chemistry of wine, nothing can be more ludicrous than the antics of the pretending connoisseur of wine who holds his glass up to the light, shuts one eye (even at the stage before double vision

FRYING. be altogether wasted. When a considerable quantity has accumulated it may be purified by the method of Dubrunfaut and Fua above described. As ordinary thermometers register but little above. 212Â° and laboratory thermometers are too delicately constructed for kitchen use, I requested Messrs. Davis & Co. to construct a special thermometer for testing the temperature of heated fat. They have accordingly made an instrument that answers the purpose very well. It is like a laboratory thermometer, i.e. a glass tube with long bulb and. the degrees engraved on the glass itself, but the bulb is turned at right angles to the tube, so that it is horizontal when the tube stands perpendicular, and lies under a stand just above the level of the bottom of the kettle. The instrument thus stands alone firmly, with its bulb fully immersed even in a very shallow bath of fat. Gouffe says : ' Fat is the best for frying ; the light- coloured dripping of roast meat, and the fat taken off broth are to be preferred. These failing, beef suet, chopped fine and melted down on a slow fire, without browning, will do very well; when the bottom of the stew- pan can be seen through the suet, it is sufficiently melted.' He is no advocate for lard, ' as it always leaves an unplea- sant coating of fat on whatever is fried in it.' Olive oil of the best quality is almost absolutely tasteless, and having as high a boiling point as animal fats it is the best of all frying media. In this country there is a prejudice against the use of such oil. I have noticed at some of those humble but most useful establishments where poor people are supplied with penny or twopenny portions of well-cooked, good fish, that in the front is an inscription stating < only the best beef-dripping is used in this esta- blishment' This means a repudiation of oil.

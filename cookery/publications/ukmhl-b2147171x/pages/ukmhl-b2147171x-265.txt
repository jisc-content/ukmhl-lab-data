TEA AND COFFEE. 253 greatly beyond that which it supplies, it follows that it must powerfully promote those vital changes in food which ultimately produce the carbonic acid to be evolved. Instead, therefore, of supplying nutritive matter, it causes the assimilation and transformation of other foods.' Now, note the following practical conclusions, which I quote in Dr. Smith's own words, but take the liberty of rendering in italics those passages that I wish the reader to specially compare with the preceding quotations from Johnston: ' In reference to nutrition, we may say that tea increases waste, since it promotes the transformation of food without supplying nutriment, and increases the loss of heat without supplying fuel, and it is therefore especially adapted to the wants of those who usually eat too much, and after a full meal, when the process of assimi- lation should be quickened, but is less adapted to the poor and ill-fed, and during fasting.' He tells us very posi- tively that ' to take tea before a meal is as absurd as not to take it after a meal, unless the system be at all times replete with nutritive material.' And, again : ' Our experiments have sufficed to show how tea may be inju- rious if taken with deficie?it food, and thereby exaggerate the evils ofthe poor /' and, again: 'The conclusions at which we arrived after our researches in 1858 were, that tea should not be taken without food, unless after a full meal; or with insufficient food ; or by the young or very feeble ; and that its essential action is to waste the system or consume food, by promoting vital action which it does not support, and they have not been dis- proved by any subsequent scientific researches.' This final assertion may be true, and to those who ' go in for the last thing out,' the latest novelty or fashion in science, literature, or millinery, the absence of any refutation of later date is quite enough.

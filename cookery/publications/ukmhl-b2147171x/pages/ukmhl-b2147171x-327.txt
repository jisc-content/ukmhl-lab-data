THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION. 315 mode of action are visibly disintegrated and consumed by their own activity, and may be seen to demand the perpetual renewal described by Liebig. There are glands of cellular structure which cast off their terminal cells containing the fluid they secrete; do their work by giving up their own structural substance at their peri- pheral working surface. Where, then, is the quicksand ? It is here. If mus- cular and mental work were done at the expense of the nitrogenous muscular and cerebral tissues, the quantity of nitrogen excreted should vary with the amount of work done. This was formerly stated to be the case without hesitation, as the following passage from Car- penter's 'Manual of Physiology' (3rd edition, 1856, page 256), shows: 'Every action of the nervous and muscular systems involves the death and decay of a certain amount of the living tissue, as is indicated by the appearance of the products of that decay in the excretions.' More recent experiments by Fick and Wislicenus, Parkes, Houghton, Ranke, Voit, Flint, and others are said to contradict this by showing that the waste nitrogen varies with the quantity of nitrogenous food that is eaten, but not with the muscular work done. For the details of these experiments I must refer the reader to standard modern physiological treatises, as a full description of them would carry me too far away from my immediate subject. (Dr. Pavy's ' Treatise on Food ' has an intro- ductory chapter on ' The Dynamic Relations of Food,' in which this subject is clearly treated in sufficient detail for popular reading.) It is quite the fashion now to rely upon these later experiments ; but for my own part, I am by no means satisfied with themâ€”and for this reason, that the

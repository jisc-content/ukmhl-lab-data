The patient had scarcely tasted alcohol before this, and therefore it exerted its maxi- mum efficacy. I was surprised at the certain response of both pulse and temperature to this most valuable medicine and most pernicious beverage.

I leave my readers to bestow on such a plea the treatment they may think it deserves.

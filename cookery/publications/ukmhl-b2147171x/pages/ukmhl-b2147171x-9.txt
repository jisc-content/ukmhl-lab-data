PREFACE. DURING the infancy of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, when my classes in Cannon Street constituted the whole of its teaching machinery, I delivered a course of lectures to ladies on ' Household Philosophy,' in which 'The Chemistry of Cookery' was included. In collecting material for these lectures, I was surprised at the strange neglect of the subject by modern chemists. On taking it up again, after an interval of nearly thirty years, I find that (excepting the chemistry of wine cookery), absolutely nothing further, worthy of the name of research, has in the meantime been brought to bear upon it. This explanation is demanded as an apology for what some may consider the egotism that permeates this little work. I have been continually compelled to put forth my own explanations of familiar phenomena, my own speculations, concerning the changes effected by cookery, and my .own small contributions to the experi- mental investigation of the subject. Under these difficult circumstances I have endea- voured to place before the reader a simple and readable account of what is known of ' The Chemistry of Cooker)-,'

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. H4 than allow a drop of water to be squeezed mechanically through it be partially filled with a solution of common washing soda, and then immersed in distilled water, the soda will make its way out of the bladder by passing through its walls, and the pure water will go in at the same time ; for if, after some time is allowed, the outer water be tested by dipping into it a strip of red litmus paper, it will be turned blue, showing the presence of the alkali therein, and if the contents of the bladder be weighed or measured, they will be found to have in- creased by the inflow of fresh water. This inflow is called endosmosis, and the outflow of the solution is called exosmosis. If an indiarubber bottle be filled with water and immersed in alcohol or ether, the endos- mosis of the spirit will be so powerfully exerted as to distend the bottle considerably. If the bottle be filled with alcohol or ether, and surrounded by water, it will nearly empty itself. The force exerted by this action is displayed by the rising of the sap from the rootlets of a forest giant to the cells of its topmost leaves. Not only plants, but animals also, are complex osmotic machines. There is scarcely any vital function—if any at all—in which this osmosis does not play an important part. I have no doubt that the mental effort I am at this moment exerting is largely dependent upon the endosmosis and exosmosis that is proceeding through the delicate membranes of some of the many miles of blood-vessels that ramify throughout the grey matter of my brain. But I must wander no farther beyond the kitchen, having already said enough to indicate that diosmosis (which is the general term used for expressing the actions of endosmosis and exosmosis as they occur simulta- neously) does the work of extracting the permanent

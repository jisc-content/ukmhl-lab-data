THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. of cheese is universal. Minestra without Parmesan would in Italy be regarded as we in England should regard muffins and crumpets without butter. During the forty years that have elapsed since my first sojourn in Italy, my sympathies are continually lacerated when I contemplate the melancholy spectacle of human beings eating thin soup without any grated cheese. Not only in soups, but in many other dishes, it is similarly used. As an example, I may name ' Risotto a la Milanese' a delicious, wholesome, and economical dishâ€”a sort of stew composed of rice and the giblets of fowls, usually charged about twopence to threepence per portion at Italian restaurants. This, I suppose, is the reason why I find no recipe for it in the ' high-class' cookery-books. It is always served with grated Par- mesan. The same with the many varieties of paste, of which macaroni and vermicelli are the best known in this country. In all these the cheese is sprinkled over, and then stirred into the soup, &c, while it is hot. The cheese being finely divided is fused at once, and thus delicately cooked. This is quite different from the ' macaroni cheese' commonly prepared in England by depositing macaroni in a pie-dish, then covering it with a stratum of grated cheese, and placing this in an oven or before a fire until the cheese is desiccated, browned, and converted into a horny, caseous form of carbon that would induce chronic dyspepsia in the stomach of a wild boar if he fed upon it for a week. In all preparations of Italian pastes, risottos, purees, &c, the cheese is intimately mixed throughout, and softened and diffused thereby in the manner above described. The Italians themselves imagine that only their own

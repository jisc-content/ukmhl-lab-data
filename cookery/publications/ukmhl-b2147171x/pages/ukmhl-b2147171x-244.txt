THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 232 ing the beggars with good hot dinners daily at the cost of less than one halfpenny each. The cost of the mess for the Bavarian soldiers under his command was rather more, viz. twopence daily, three farthings of this being devoted to pure luxuries, such as beer, &c. Some of his chemical speculations, however, have not been confirmed. The composition of water had just been discovered, and he found by experience that a given quantity of solid food was more satisfying to the appetite and more effective in nutrition when made into soup by long boiling with water. This led him to sup- pose that the water itself was decomposed by cookery, and its elements recombined or united with other ele- ments, and thus became nutritious by being converted into the tissues of plants and animals. Thus, speaking of the barley which formed an impor- tant constituent of his soup, he says : ' It requires, it is true, a great deal of boiling; but when it is properly managed, it thickens a vast quantity of water, and, as I suppose, prepares it for decomposition ' (the italics are his own). We now know that this idea of decomposing water by such means is a mistake ; but, in my own opinion, there is something behind it which still remains to be learned by modern chemists. In my endeavours to fathom the rationale of the changes which occur in cookery, I have been (as my readers will remember) continually driven into hypotheses of hydration, i.e. of supposing that some of the water used in cookery unites to form true chem- ical compounds with certain of the constituents of the food. As already stated, when I commenced this subject I had no idea of its suggestiveness, of the wide field of research which it has opened out. One of these lines of research is the determination of the nature of this

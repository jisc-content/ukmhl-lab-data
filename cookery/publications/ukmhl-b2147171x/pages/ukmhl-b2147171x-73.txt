ROASTING AND GRILLING. 6r comparatively luxurious station (Ronnei), where ham and eggs and claret were obtainable. The first glass of claret produced an effect that alarmed meâ€”a craving for more and for stronger drink, that was almost irre- sistible. I finished a bottle of St. Julien, and nothing but a violent effort of will prevented me from then ordering brandy. I attribute this to the exhaustion consequent upon the excessive work and insufficient unsavoury food of the previous five days ; have made many subsequent observations on the victims of alcohol, and have no doubt that overwork and scanty, tasteless food is the primary source of the craving for strong drink that so largely prevails with such deplorable results among the class that is the most exposed to such privation. I do not say that this is the only source of such depraved appetite. It may also be engendered by the opposite extreme of excessive luxurious pandering to general sensuality. The practical inference suggested by this experience and these observations is, that speech-making, pledge- signing, and blue-ribbon missions can only effect tem- porary results unless supplemented by satisfying the natural appetite of hungiy people by supplies of food that are not only nutritious, but savoury and varied. Such food need be no more expensive than that which is commonly eaten by the poorest of Englishmen, but it must be far better cooked. Comparing the domestic economy of the poorer classes of our countrymen with that of the correspond- ing classes in France and Italy (with both of which I am well acquainted), I find that the raw material of the dietary of the French and Italians is inferior to that of the English, but a far better result is obtained by better

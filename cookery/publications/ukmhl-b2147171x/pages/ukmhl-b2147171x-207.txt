GLUTEN-BREAD. 195 action of hot alcohol, it is separated into two distinct substances, one soluble and the other insoluble. As the solution cools, a further separation takes place of a substance soluble in hot alcohol but not in cold, and another soluble in either hot or cold alcohol. The first, viz. that insoluble in either hot or cold alcohol, has been named gluten-fibrin; that soluble in hot alcohol, but not in cold, gluten-casein ; and that soluble in either hot or cold alcohol, glutin. I give these names and explain them, as my readers may be otherwise puzzled by meeting them in books where they are used without explanation, especially as there is another substance presently to be described, to which the name of' vegetable casein ' has also been applied. The gluten-fibrin is supposed to correspond with blood-fibrin, gluten-casein with animal- casein, and glutin with albumen. Their composition is as follows, which I append for what it is worth in con- nection with this theory, but mainly to show how small is the difference between the chemical composition of the nitrogenous constituents of animals and those of plants.

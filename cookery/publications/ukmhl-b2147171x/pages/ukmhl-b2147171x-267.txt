255 TEA AND COFFEE. were extended to 50 minutes, 71 minutes, 65 minutes, and in one case to I hour and 50 minutes. It is worthy of note that, in Experiment 1, 100 grains of black tea were given to two persons, and the duration of the experiment was 50 and 71 minutes ; the average increase was 71 and 68 cubic inches per minute, while in No. 6, with the same dose and the carbonic acid collected during 1 hour and 50 minutes, the average in- crease per minute was only 47-5 cubic inches. These indicate a decline of the exaltation, and the curves on his diagrams show the same. His coffee results were similar. We all know that the * refreshing' action of tea often extends over a considerable period. My own experi- ments on myself show that it continues about three or four hours, and that of beer or wine less than one hour (moderate doses in each case). I have tested this by walking measured distances after taking the stimulant and comparing with my walking powers when taking no other beverage than cold water. The duration of the tea stimulation has been also measured (painfully so) by the duration of sleeplessness when female seduction has led me to drink tea late in the evening. The duration of coffee is about one-third less than tea. Lehmann's experiments extending over weeks (days instead of minutes), measured the whole effect of the alkaloid and oil of the coffee during both the periods of exaltation and depression, and, therefore, supplied a mean or total result which accords with ordinary every- day experience. It is well known that the pot of tea of the poor needlewoman subdues the natural craving for food ; the habitual smoker claims the same merit for his pipe, and the chewer for his quid.

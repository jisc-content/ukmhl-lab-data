96 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. few words about French coffee, or ' Coffee as in France,' of which we hear so much. There are two secrets upon which depend the excellence of our neighbours in the production of this beverage. First, economy in using the water; second, flavouring with caramel. As regards the first, it appears that English housewives have been demoralised by the habitual use of tea, and apply to the infusion of coffee the popular formula for that of tea, ' a spoonful for each person and one for the pot' The French after-dinner coffee-cup has about one- third of the liquid capacity of a full-sized English breakfast-cup, but the quantity of solid coffee supplied to each cupful is more than equal to that ordinarily allowed for the larger English measure of water. Besides this, the coffee is commonly, though not uni- versally, flavoured with a specially and skilfully-pre- pared caramel, instead of the chicory so largely used in England. Much of the so-called ' French coffee' now sold by our grocers in tins is caramel flavoured with coffee rather than coffee flavoured with caramel, and many shrewd English housewives have discovered that by mixing the cheapest of these French coffees with an equal quantity of pure coffee they obtain a better result than with the common domestic mixture of three parts coffee and one of chicory. A few months ago a sample of ' coffee-finings' was sent to me for chemical examination, that I might cer- tify to its composition and wholesomeness. I described it in my report as 'a caramel, with a peculiarly rich aroma and flavour, evidently due to the vegetable juices or extractive matter naturally united with the saccharine substance from which it is prepared.' I had no definite information of the exact nature of this saccharine sub-

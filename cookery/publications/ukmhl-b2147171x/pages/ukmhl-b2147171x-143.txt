CHEESE. unknown art, especially in this country. We commonly eat it raw, although in its raw state it is peculiarly indi- gestible, and in the only cooked form familiarly known among us here, that of a Welsh rabbit, or rarebit, it is too often rendered still more indigestible, though this need not be the case. Here, in this densely-populated country, where we import so much of our food, cheese demands our most profound attention. The difficulties and cost of import- ing all kinds of meat, fish, and poultry are great, while cheese may be cheaply and deliberately brought to us from any part of the world where cows or goats can be fed, and it can be stored more readily and kept longer than other kinds of animal food. All that is required to render it, next to bread, the staple food of Britons is scientific cookery. If I shall be able, in what is to follow, to impart to my fellow-countrymen, and more especially country- women, my own convictions concerning the cookability, and consequent improved digestibility, of cheese, I shall have ' done the State some service !' Taking muscular fibre without bone—i.e. selected best part of the meat—beef contains on an average 72^ per cent, of water ; mutton, 73I; veal, 74^ ; pork, 69% ; fowl, 73I; while Cheshire cheese contains only 30^-, and other cheeses about the same. Thus, at starting, we have in every pound of cheese rather more than twice as much solid food as in a pound of the best meat, or comparing with the average of the whole carcass, in- cluding bone, tendons, &c, the cheese has an advantage of three to one.

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 212 All the leguminous seeds, the ground-nuts, &c, have their nitrogenous constituents displayed under the name of ' casein.' The use of this term is rather confusing. In many modern books it does not appear at all in connection with the vegetable kingdom, but is replaced by ' legumin.' Liebig regarded this nitrogenous con- stituent of the leguminous seeds, almonds, &c, as iden- tical with the casein of milk, and it was a pupil and friend of Liebig's—the late Prince Consort—who devised and originally supervised this graphic method of dis- playing the chemistry of food.1 I will not here discuss the vexed question of whether the analyses of Liebig, identifying legumin with casein, or rather those of Dumas and Cahours, who state that the vegetable casein is not of the same composition as animal casein, are correct. The following figures display my justification for thus lightly treating the discussion : Casein Legumin Legumin Legumin Carbon 537 50-SO 55-05 56-24 Hydrogen. 7'2 678 7-59 7'97 Nitrogen . i6-6 18-17 15-89 I5-83 Oxygen and Sulphur . 22'5 24-55 21-47 19-96 The first column shows the results of Dumas for animal casein ; the second, those of Dumas and Cahours for legumin ; the third, those of Jones for the same ; and 1 Shortly after the close of the Great Exhibition of 1851, when the South Kensington Museum was only in embryo, I had occasion to call on Dr. Lyon Play fair at the 1 boilers,' and there found the Prince hard at work giving instructions for the arrangement and labelling of these analysed food products and the similarly displayed materials of industry, such as whalebone, ivory, &c. I then, by inquiry, learned how much time and labour he was devoting, not only to the general business of the collection, but also to its minor details.

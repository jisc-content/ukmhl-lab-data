26 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. meat, exposing it to the action of cold water, and then evaporating down the solution of extract thus obtained. I shall return to this on reaching the subjects of clear soups and beef-tea, at present merely adding as evidence of the importance of retaining these juices in cooked meat, that the extracts of beef, mutton, and pork may be distinguished by their specific flavours. Some Extract of Kangaroo, sent to me many years ago from Australia by the Ramornie Company, made a soup that was curi- ously different in flavour from the other extract similarly prepared by the same company. Epicures pronounced it very choice and' gamey.'1 When these juices are removed from the meat, mutton, beef, pork, &c, the remaining solids are all alike,so far as the palate alonecan distinguish. Let us now apply these principles practically to the case of a leg of mutton. First, in order to seal the pores, the meat should be put into boiling water ; the water should be kept boiling for five or ten minutes. A coat- ing of firmly-coagulated albumen will thus envelop the joint. Now, instead of boiling or ' simmering' the water, set the saucepan aside, where the water will retain a temperature of about 1800, or 32Â° below the boiling- point. Continue this about half as long again, or double the usual time given in the cookery-books for boiling a leg of mutton, and try the effect. It will be analogous to that of the egg cooked on the same principles, and appreciated accordingly. The usual addition of salt to the water is very desir- able. It has a threefold action : first, it directly acts on the superficial albumen with coagulating effect; second, it slightly raises the boiling-point of the water ; and 1 It was given to me in 1868. I have just found that some of it re- mains unused (December 1884), and that it still retains its characteristic flavour. (

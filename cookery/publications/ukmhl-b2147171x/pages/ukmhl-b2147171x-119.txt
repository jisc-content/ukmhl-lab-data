FRYING. 107 I dwell upon this because we are probably on what, if a fine writer, I should call the 'eve of a great revolu- tion ' in respect to frying media. Two new materials, pure, tasteless, and so cheap as to be capable of pushing pig-fat (lard) out of the market, have recently been introduced. These are cotton-seed oil and poppy-seed oil. The first has been for some time in the market offered for sale under various fictitious names, which I will not reveal, as I refuse to become a medium for the advertisement of anything—however good in itself—that is sold under false pretences. As every bale of cotton yields half a ton of seed, and every ton of seed maybe made to yield 28 lbs. to 32 lbs. of crude oil, the available quantity is very great. At present only a small quantity is made, the surplus seed being used as manure. Its fertilising value would not be diminished by removing the oil, which is only a hydro-carbon, i.e. material supplied by air and water. All the fertilising constituents of the seed are left behind in the oil-cake from which the oil has been pressed. Hitherto cotton-seed oil has fallen among thieves. It is used as an adulterant of olive oil ; sardines and pil- chards are packed in it. The sardine trade has declined lately, some say from deficient supplies of the fish. I suspect that there has been a decline in the demand due to the substitution of this oil for that of the olive. Many people who formerly enjoyed sardines no longer care for them, and they do not know why. The substitution of cotton-seed oil explains this in most cases. It is not rancid, has no decided flavour, but still is unpleasant when eaten raw, as with salads or sardines. It has a flat, cold character, and an after taste that is faintly suggestive of castor oil ; but faint as it is, it interferes with the demand for a purely luxurious article of food.

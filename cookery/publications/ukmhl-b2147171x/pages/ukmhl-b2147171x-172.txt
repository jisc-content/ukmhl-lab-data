160 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. than the lard we now obtain in such abundance from Chicago and other wholesale hog regions. I have not witnessed the lard rendering at Chicago, but have little doubt that economy of fuel is practised in conducting it, and therefore less dissociation would be effected than in the domestic retail process. Some of the early manufacturers of ' bosch' purified their fat by the process recommended and practised by the French Academicians MM. Dubrunfaut and Fua (see page 102). I wrote about it in 1871, and consequently received some samples of artificial butter thus made in the Midlands. It was pur.e fat, perfectly wholesome, but, although coloured to imitate butter, had the granular character of dripping. Since that time great progress has been made in this branch of industry. I have lately tasted samples of pure 'bosch' or 'oleomargarine' un- distinguishable from churned cream or good butter, though offered for sale at Z\d. per lb. in wholesale pack- ages. In the preparation of this the high temperatures of the process of the Academicians are carefully avoided, and the smoothness of pure butter is obtained. I men- tion this now merely in confirmation of my theory of the rationale of fat cookery, but shall return to this subject of ' bosch ' or butterine again, as it has considerable in- trinsic interest in reference to our food supplies, and should be better understood than it is. If this theory of fat cookery and the preceding theo- retical explanations of the cookery of gelatin and fibrin are correct, a broad practical deduction follows, viz. that in the cookery of fat the full temperature of 212° or even a much higher temperature does no mischief, or may be desirable, while all the other constituents of meat are better cooked at a temperature not exceeding 212°; the albumen especially at a considerably lower temperature.

278 THE CHEMISTRY OE COOKERY. isinglass or white of egg, which are quite unobjection- able and very efficient ? To this question I could get no satisfactory answer directly, but learned vaguely that the fining produced by the white of egg, though com- plete at the time, was not permanent, while that effected by Spanish earth, containing much sulphate of lime, is permanent. The brilliancy thus obtained is not lost by age or variations of temperature, and the dry sherries thus cooked are preferred by English wine-drinkers. The sulphate of potash which, by the action of sulphate of lime, is made to replace bitartrate, is so readily soluble that neither changes of temperature nor increase of alcohol, due to further fermentation, will throw it down ; and thus the wine-maker and wine- merchant, without any guilty intent, and ignorant of what he is really doing, sophisticates the wine, alters its essential composition, and adds an impurity in doing what he supposes to be a mere clarification or removal of impurities. I have heard of genuine sherries being returned as bad to the shipper because they were genuine, and had been fined without sophistication. My own experience of genuine wines in wine-growing countries teaches me that such wines are rarely brilliant; and the variations of solubility of the natural salt of the grape, which I have already explained, shows why this is the case. If the drinkers of sherry and other white and golden wines would cease to demand the con- ventional brilliancy, they would soon be supplied with the genuine article, which really costs the wine-merchant less than the cooked product they now insist upon having. This foolish demand of his customers merely gives him a large amount of unnecessary trouble and annoyance. So far, the wine-merchant; but how about the con-

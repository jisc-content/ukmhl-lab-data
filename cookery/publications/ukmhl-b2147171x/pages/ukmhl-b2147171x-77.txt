COUNT RUM FORD'S ROASTER. 65 the mistress's wardrobe offered no particular motive for going to church, and she stayed at home and roasted the Sunday dinner. The experience thus obtained demon- strated a material difference between the flavour of the roasted and the baked meat very decidedly in favour of the home roasted. Why ? The principal reason was, I believe, that the baker's large bread-oven contained at dinner-time a curious medley of meatsâ€”mutton, beef, pork, geese, veal, &c, including stuffing with sage and onions, besides the pos- sibility of a joint or two that had been hung longer than was necessary for procuring tenderness. The vapours of these would induce a confusion of flavours in the milder meats, fully accounting for the observed superiority of the home-roasted joints. A little reflection on the principles already expounded will show that, theoretically regarded, a given piece of meat would be better roasted in a closed chamber radi- ating heat from all sides towards the meat than it could be when suspended in front of a fire and heated only on one side, while the other side was turned away to cool more or less, according to the rate of rotation. If I agreed with the popular belief in the advantage of open-air exposure to direct radiation from glowing coal, I should suggest that for large joints a special roast- ing fire be constructed, by building an upright cylinder of fire-brick, and erecting within this a smaller cylinder or grating of iron bars, so that the fuel should be placed between these, and thus form an upright cylindrical ring or shirt of fire, enclosed outside by the bricks, but open and glowing towards the inside of the hollow cylinder, in the midst of which the meat should be suspended to receive the radiation from all sides. The whole apparatus might stand under a dome, F

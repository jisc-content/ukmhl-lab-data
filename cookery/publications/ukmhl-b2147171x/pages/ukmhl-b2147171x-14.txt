THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 2 sculptor merely moves away the outer portions, -and thereby renders his artistic conception visible to his fellow-men. The agriculturist merely moves the soil in order that it may receive the seed, which he then moves into it, and when the growth is completed, he moves the result, and thereby makes his harvest. The same may be said of every other operation.

My reasons for this introductory digression will be easily understood, as this view of the doings of man and the doings of Nature displays fundamentally the business of human education, so far as the physical proceedings and physical welfare of mankind are concerned. It clearly points out two well-marked natural divi- sions of such education—education or training in the movements to be made, and education in a knowledge of the consequences of such movements—i.e. in a know- ledge of the forces of Nature which actually do the work when man has suitably arranged the materials. The education ordinarily given to apprentices in the workshop, or the field, or the studio—or, as relating to my present subject, the kitchen—is the first of these, the second and equally necessary being simply and purely the teaching of physical science as applied to the arts. I cannot proceed any further without a protest against a very general (so far as this countiy is con- cerned) misuse of a now very popular term, a misuse that is rather surprising, seeing that it is accepted by scholars who have devoted the best of their intellectual efforts to the study of words. I refer to the word

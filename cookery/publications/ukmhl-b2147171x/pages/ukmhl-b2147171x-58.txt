46 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. — Kreatine Kreatinine Carbon 36-64 42-48 Hydrogen . 6-87 6-19 Nitrogen 32-06 37-17 Oxygen 24-43 14-16 ioo-oo ioo-oo They appear to undergo no change in cooking unless excessively heated ; may be used uncooked, as in cold- drawn extract of meat. The juices of lean flesh also contain a little lactic acid—the acid of milk—but this does not appear to be an absolutely essential constituent. Besides these there are mineral salts of considerable nutritive importance, though small in quantity. These, with the kreatine and kreatinine, are the chief constituents of beef-tea properly so-called, and will be further treated when I come to that preparation. At present it is sufficient to keep in view the fact that these juices are essential to complete the nutritive value of animal food.

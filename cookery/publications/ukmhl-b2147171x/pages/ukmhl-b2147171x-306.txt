294 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XVII. THE VEGETARIAN QUESTION In my introductory chapter I said, ' The fact that we use the digestive and nutrient apparatus of sheep, oxen, &c., for the preparation of our food is merely a tran- sitory barbarism, to be ultimately superseded when my present subject is sufficiently understood and applied to enable us to prepare the constituents of the vegetable kingdom to be as easily assimilated as the prepared grass which we call beef and mutton.' This sentence, when it appeared in 'Knowledge,' brought me in communication with a very earnest body of men and women, who at considerable social incon- venience are abstaining from flesh food, and doing it purely on principle. Some people sneer at them, call them ' crotchetty,' ' faddy,' &c, but, for my own part, I have a great respect for crotchetty people, having learned long ago that every first great step that has ever been taken in the path of human progress was denounced as a crotchet by those it was leaving behind. This respect is quite apart from the consideration of whether I agree or disagree with the crotchets themselves. I therefore willingly respond to the request that I should explain more fully my view of this subject. The fact that there are now in London eight exclusively vegetarian restaurants, and all of them flourishing, shows that it is one of wide interest.

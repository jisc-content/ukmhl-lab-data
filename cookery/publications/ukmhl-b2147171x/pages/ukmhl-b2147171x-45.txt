GELATIN, FIBRIN, AND THE JUICES OF MEAT 33 solubility of the juvenile hoof, as compared to that of the adult ox or horse, or to the parings of hides about to be used by the tanner. All these produce gelatin by boiling, the calves' feet with comparatively little boiling. Besides these differences there are decided varieties, or, I might say, species of gelatin, having slight differ- ences of chemical composition and chemical relations. There is Chondrin, or cartilage gelatin, which is ob- tained by boiling the cartilages of the ribs, larynx, or joints for eighteen or twenty hours in water. Then there is Fibroin, obtained by boiling spiders' webs and the silk of silkworms or other caterpillars. These exist as a liquid inside the animal, which solidifies on ex- posure. The fibres of sponge contain this modification of gelatin. Another kind is Chitin, which constituted the animal food of St. John the Baptist, when he fed upon locusts and wild honey. It is the basis of the bodily structure of insects; of the spiral tubes which permeate them throughout, and are so wonderfully displayed when we examine insect anatomy by aid of the microscope ; also of their intestinal canal, their external skeleton, scales, hairs, &c. It similarly forms the true skeleton and bodily framework of crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and other Crustacea, bearing the same relation to their shells, muscles, &c, that ordinary gelatin does to the bones and softer tissues of the vertebrata ; it is ' the bone of their bones, and the flesh of their flesh.' It is obtainable by boiling these creatures down, but is more difficult of solution than the ordinary gelatin of beef, mutton, fish, and poultry. To this difficulty of solution in the stomach, the nightmare that follows lobster suppers is probably attributable. I once had an experience of the edibility of the shells D

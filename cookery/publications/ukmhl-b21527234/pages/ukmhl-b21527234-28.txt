24 when doing what is right, over doing it. An over- dose cure is as mischievous as overdone meat. The causes of indigestion are many, and some- times remote. We are not writing a medical work, and shall confine our attention here to what we may call simple indigestion, arising from having eaten what is difficult to digest or from not being able to digest what we have eaten, which are not one and the same thing. Of the first cause we shall speak more fully later on. Here we shall content ourselves with briefly discussing the failure of nature to provide us with sufficient powers of digestion or the failure of these powers through being overstrained or otherwise weakened. Let us return to our causes. Indigestion is frequently brought on by indulging too freely in food that taken in moderate quantities is perfectly whole- some, by eating at too short or too long intervals, by imperfect mastication, by our food being improperly cooked (see page 35), by abuse of spices and condi- ments, by drinking too much with our meals, by imbibing too much or over-drawn tea, by excessive use of tobacco, by eating when over tired, by violent exertion immediately after a repast, etc. So it will be seen at once that many people have only them- selves to thank if they are a prey to dyspepsia. An unhealthy state or a deficient quantity of the gastric juice, or of any of the other digestive auses. we have mentioned, leads to indiges- tion. Indigestion is in many cases hereditary. As a rule those whose work keeps them active and out of doors are less liable to suffer from it than those whose occupation is sedentary.

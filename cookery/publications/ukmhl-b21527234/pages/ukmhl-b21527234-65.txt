FISH In this country we are rather apt to underrate fish, and to eat too little of it, just as we so often eat too much meat. A day of fish fare occasionally is both pleasant and wholesome, a change for the Fare palate and a good variety for the digestion. Of the cooking of fish we need not say much, but the following few brief hints, simple as they are, may prove useful. Fresh water fish often has a muddy flavour, this may be remedied by washing thoroughly in strongly salted water. Except mackerel and salt fish, put your fish into boiling water. Remove all scum from the top of the water during cooking. Under-cooked fish is very indigestible. Do not have your oven too hot when baking fish. Be careful your fish is quite dry before you egg and bread crumb. A few bay leaves in the water in which you boil cod or any like fish gives them a pleasanter flavour. Scraps of cold fish can usually be made up into pleasant and tasty dishes.

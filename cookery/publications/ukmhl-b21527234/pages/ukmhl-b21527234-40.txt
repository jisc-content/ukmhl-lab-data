36 is unprofitable and wasteful. Roughly speaking, our methods of applying heat to our foods may be Wet and descril:)ed as “ wet ” and “ dry.” Roasting. Dry for example, is the application of dry heat: boiling, of wet; while baking comes between the two, as the oven during that process soon becomes filled with moist heat. In boiling, roasting and baking, the first application of heat should be intense in order to preserve the juices in the meat, afterwards the heat may be lowered till the meat is cooked throughout. Thus a perfectly cooked chop, or steak, or joint should be brown outside : when cut for a fraction of an inch, red or reddy brown to the centre. Cooked meat should not cut dry but juicy. So much for theory. Let us turn to practice, and briefly describe the various methods of cooking meat generally used in English kitchens, giving at the same time a few practical hints, generally known, perhaps, but also generally forgotten. ROASTING. Roasting claims pride of place, not only as being, probably, the most ancient mode of cooking, but as the most excellent. But, alas, pride has had a fall, and the reign of the close range has driven roasting almost out of 'private practice. However, if you have a fire at which you can roast, never bake your meat. The latter method is neither so wholesome, for the meat is apt to be wooden and juiceless, nor so toothsome. In roasting a clean fire is the first essential, and a

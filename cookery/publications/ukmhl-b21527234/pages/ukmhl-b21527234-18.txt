14 “ chew your food well ” is one of the wisest. Like many of the habits inculcated in children, it is one much honoured in the breach by their elders. Many a hard-worked man bolts his breakfast and rushes off to work; much better rise half an hour earlier and breakfast in peace, so avoiding much future pain and distress. As before noted, a pause from labour of any sort is most desirable after meals. It follows from this that the heaviest meal of the day should be taken when the day’s work is completed, that is for most persons in the evening. Breakfast also, provided that sufficient time can be given to it and that work does not commence immediately after its consumption, should be a “ hearty ” meal. The man who can eat, enjoy and digest a good breakfast may feel reasonably sure that there is not much amiss with himself or his habits of life. Food should so be constituted as to enable the consumer to repair waste of flesh and muscle and loss of heat and energy, and can therefore be generally divided into flesh makers and heat producers, which in more scientific language are nitrogenous and carbonaceous.

When water has been brought to the boil, it is kept so by application of very moderate heat—a roaring fire is sheer waste of coal. Salted meat is never as nourishing as fresh meat —and therefore in the end no cheaper. Baking. In modern kitchens baking rules the roast, the more’s the pity. The chief difference between baking and roasting is that the fumes given off by the meat are not carried off in the former case, remaining in the oven and affecting the flavour of the meat. The best ventilated ovens do not altogether obviate this. The outside of baked meats are never so crisp and tasty as that of roasted meat. Pastry, of course, requiring to be cooked at a more moderate tempera- ture than that used in roasting, is properly always a baked “ meat.” The same remarks, as made above, with regard to boiling and roasting, apply to baking of meat— the heat at first must be intense, afterward more gentle.

54 ROUX (Brown Thickening).—Take equal portions of flour and butter; melt the butter in the oven, and then stir in the flour, mixing it thoroughly. Bake it till it browns on the top, then stir ; repeat till the whole is light brown in colour. While Thickening is made in a similar way, only the mixture must be taken from the oven before it browns. Parsley should always be blanched—i.e., plunged for a few seconds into scalding water. Soup must always be served HOT. PEA SOUP. Ingredients £ pint Split Peas. 1 Onion. 1 Carrot. 1 Turnip. Small Head of Celery. 1 oz. of Flour. oz. of Butter Mint. Salt. Pepper. Soak the peas overnight in cold water. Throw away any that float on the top, as they are bad. Boil the peas with an onion, carrot, turnip, and small head of celery or some celery salt, and a piece of mint, till the peas are tender. Then rub through a wire sieve, add salt and pepper, mix the butter and flour together, add the soup gradually, make hot and serve with powdered mint sprinkled over. This soup is improved if some kind of thin stock is used instead of water, to counteract the dryness of the pea flour.

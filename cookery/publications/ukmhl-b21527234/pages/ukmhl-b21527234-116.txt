CAKES Cakes are excellent things at all times, when good, and there is no real reason why they should not always be so, if cook is careful. Here are just a few hints :— Baking powder and soda should be put in immediately before baking the cake. It is generally a better plan to put greased paper in your cake tins than to grease the tin itself, the latter plan often leading to burning. Be sure when making your cakes that all your fruit is quite dry, otherwise the cake may be heavy. And—please—always serve hot cakes really hot —not tepid. NORTHERN LIGHTS.

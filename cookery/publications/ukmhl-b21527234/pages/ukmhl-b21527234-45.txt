41 STEAMING. Steaming can be done in two ways:—in a steamer, in which the steam passing through the perforated bottom of the upper part cooks the food coming into contact with it; in a double vessel—a pot or basin within a pot, the inner one closed or covered up, so the steam does not touch the food. There are few “boiled” puddings that would not be better cooked if steamed. Vegetables are preferable steamed to boiled, particularly potatoes, as cooked in this way not so much of their mineral salts are lost. Steaming is slower than boiling. Be careful that the water keeps on the boil, otherwise the food—particularly puddings—becomes sodden or heavy. If more water must be added— owing to the first supply having boiled nearly away —it must be added boiling hot. Grilling. In grilling, or broiling as it is sometimes called, a clear fire is the great essential. A coke fire is excellent for the purpose. The gridiron must be kept scrupulously clean, and should be greased before use. The “ grill ” can be wrapped in paper to obviate the danger of burning, but it is not necessary and lengthens the process. The gridiron should be as close as possible to the fire when the grilling begins, so that the meat may retain its juices. French cooks attain this end by coating the meat with oil.

SALADS. A SIMPLE salad is a simple dish to prepare, yet how rarely when confronted with it, can we truthfully exclaim “ Perfection ! '* The chief fault with English salads is as a rule that there is too much dressing, the Sweet second that the dressing has not been s 'TEEty carefully mixed. In lettuce salad the IMP ICI * first necessity is that your lettuce should be fresh, the second that it should be dry. Do not wash your lettuce as if it were a dish-cloth, but taking it from the water, gently shake it, then dry by tossing it in a dry cloth. Then break them up with your fingers, never letting a knife come near them, and of course use only the hearts. Never dress your salad till just before it is to go on the table. Let the procedure be thus :—heap up your lettuce, or collect the other materials of which it is to be made. Then in an empty bowl mix the dressing ; into this put your salad, and turn it over and over with a spoon and fork, till thoroughly covered—or coated—with the dressing. Then lift out into the bowl in which it is to be served, leaving the superfluous dressing in the first bowl. The best plain salad dressing is :—two parts of best salad oil to one of vinegar. In the vinegar— A Rla|n say for example a tablespoonful—stir a Dressing mustard-spoonful of French mustard (or ordinary English), a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper. Then stir in the oil.

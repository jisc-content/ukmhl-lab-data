45 think enough -when planning out our meals. Take instances. You have not caught your hare, so cannot jug it. Then why not jug a rabbit, or some beef- steak ? Both are admirable dishes. Lettuce is out of season, so we cannot have a salad with our cold beef, and must put up with pickles. Why so ? Were not some brussels sprouts left over from dinner ? Put them in a glass dish, and turn them over in a salad dressing of one part of vinegar to two parts of oil, a spoonful of mustard, a pinch of pepper and of salt, and you have a salad fit for an epicure. So also you can treat cold cauliflower, beetroot and celery, turnips and carrots, peas and carrot, broad beans {young), and so forth. Always make your table pretty. Costly flowers are not needed, the homeliest do just as well. So does a fern, or even a bunch of foliage nicely arranged in a vase. Take the bottles out of your The cruet and group them at the corners of Table y°m> table with the salts and the mustard pot. Always have your knives and silver bright and spotless. A napkin under the dish covers a multitude of sins. Serve the gravy in a sauce tureen hot. In short, provide a proper and seemly setting for your good fare. Looks go for a great deal in this world—as all women know.

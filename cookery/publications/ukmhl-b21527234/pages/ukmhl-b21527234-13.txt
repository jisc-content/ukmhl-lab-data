Chapter I. Foods and Feeding. Y I^OOD is that which man eats in order to L/ sustain the strength of his body; it is the I V? fuel of the human engine. We can hardly give too much attention to the food we consume or to its preparation, nor should we ever forget that we eat not merely to satisfy our hunger, but at the same time to nourish our bodies and to keep them in proper working order. Many of the diseases of life would disappear if we gave proper consideration to the “ food-question,” and, beside avoiding illnesses actually caused by improper feeding, we should be better able to repel the attacks of disease in general, if we were careful to keep our bodies in good con- dition. We prepare a fruitful soil for disease germs by neglecting to be careful in our diet. Why We Eat. With food, as with many other matters, most of us realise that we often act unwisely, yet make no effort at amendment. But after all, to feed wisely and well is one of the most important of our daily duties, and, properly taken in hand, one of the easiest. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of wholesome food properly prepared. In that word wholesome lies an imaginary sting, for what is wholesome is too often connected in our minds with what is unappetising. A good wholesome dinner means too frequently a heavy, stupid meal, but that is the housekeeper’s fault, not Nature’s.

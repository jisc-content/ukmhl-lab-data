87 handful of salt thrown upon it greatly assists matters. If you have wood, burn it in preference to coal. At the commencement the joint should be as near the fire as you can put it without burning it, so that the pores of the meat may be sealed up and the juices retained. Basting is necessary to prevent the meat becoming dry. Frozen meat takes longer to cook than fresh. The watched pot never boils ; the unwatched joint generally spoils. Boiling. As in roasting, so in boiling during the first quarter of an hour great heat should be applied ; fresh meat should be put into water boiling furiously. Afterwards it should boil quietly. Salt meat should be put into warm water and then gently boiled till cooked. All scum should be removed from the water while meat is boiling, otherwise it discolours the meat. Fierce heat seals up the meat by hardening the albumen, thus forming, as it were, an outer casing which keeps in the juices. If this is not achieved, especially in boiling and frying, the meat becomes tough and tastelessâ€”unpleasant and unwholesome. That this is reasonable will at once become obvious when you remember that you adopt precisely the opposite process when you wish to use pot liquor for stock, or soup, or broth. Also, for similar reasons, fresh meat should never be soaked, such a proceeding merely resulting in loss of nutritive matter. Salted and dried meat, however, should be treated in this way.

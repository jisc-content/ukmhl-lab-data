35 cannot cook oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, &c.; we can cook starch, albumen, gelatin, cellulose, &c. Starch in an uncooked form is most indigestible, properly and well cooked it is easily Heating (Pjgggtible. Well baked bread, or rusks, Cooking 01 biscuits, are easy digest, because the starch contained in the flour is rendered digestible by being thoroughly cooked. Bread not well baked is indigestible, not only because the starch is not sufficiently cooked, but, as we have pointed out already, because it is difficult to mapticate—to chew—properly. The same reasoning applies to all cakes, scones, &c. Again ; cellulose is woody fibre, which is softened or loosened by the application of heat, thus being made easier to chew and more easily dissolved by the digestive juices. Instinct has led us so to combine our foods and so to cook them, at any rate in many instances, so that the whole may contain what the parts taken alone do not possess, so that the whole is digestible and nourishing, while the parts alone would not be so. Eggs and bacon, beans and bacon, salt fish and egg sauce are a few examples of this fact. And this proves that the chemist has a right to speak to the cook. He cannot tell us how to make our dishes tasty, that we must teach ourselves, but he can and does teach us how to make them wholesome. He warns us off forbidden fruit. Cooking, then, is the application of heat to our food to make it more palatable and more digestible. The first rule a cook must learn is not to overdo any- thing. Overcooked meat is indigestible and does not nourish. Often meat that we think nicely boiled has been deprived of much of its nourishing pro- perties, and roasted meat that is brown throughout

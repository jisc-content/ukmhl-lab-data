56 APPLE SOUP. Ingredients 1^ lbs. Apples. 2 oz. Sago. 1 Lemon. Gloves. Powdered Cinnamon. Lump Sugar. Peel and core the apples. Boil them with a quart of water, a dozen cloves and the sago; add a small lemon sliced thin, and a small half-teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon. Sweeten to taste with lump sugar. Ground Ginger. Take a vegetable marrow, preferably a green one, peel and cut open. Remove all pips and put into a saucepan with the butter, a teaspoonful of powdered white sugar, a good pinch of ginger and pepper and salt. Let the marrow fry gently, being careful it does not turn colour. After cooking in this manner for about ten minutes, add some boiling milk or cream, and let the whole simmer until the marrow is quite cooked. Rub through a wire sieve and serve with fried bread. The quantity of milk depends on the size of the marrow, but it should be borne in mind that the marrow contains a great deal of water, and the soup should not be too thin. VEGETABLE MARROW SOUP.

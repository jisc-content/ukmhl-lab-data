VEGETABLES. Whatever some folk may say of meat, vegetables everyone admits are an essential part of a healthy dietary. Yet in England much too little attention is Neglect &*ven their preparation ; we are famous eglect. £or our roast beef, but not for the way in which we cook our vegetables. Potatoes, as we have said before, need not always be boiled. However they are cooked they should be well cooked, an under-done potato is an insult to our digestion. Vegetables should not be prepared for cooking long before the operation of cooking is commenced, e.g., potatoes should be peeled just before going into the pot. A vegetable course—pure and simple—is a very pleasant change in the programme of a dinner. Cauliflower au gratin, asparagus, celeriac, salsify, peas, &c., are nice by themselves. Vegetables should be as fresh as possible. Always put a little soda in hard water. FRIED PARSNIPS. Ingredients : 3 Large Parsnips. Salt. 1 Egg. Butter. Bread Crumbs.

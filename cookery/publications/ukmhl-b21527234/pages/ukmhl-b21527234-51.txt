47 Tinned Qoods. Melon. T ENDER Steak, Stock. All tinned goods must be removed from the tin immediately the tin is opened. A tin that bulges is bad, and, therefore, poisonous. Melon is excellent served in slices at the beginning of dinner. Pepper with it is preferable to sugar. Steak can be made tender for certain by brushing it over with salad oil or rubbing it with butter. The former is the safest plan. An enamelled saucepan is the best for making stock.

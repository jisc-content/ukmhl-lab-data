It contains a dish in which a pie can be baked, a tin case with a division, in which cold poultry, game, or meat can be taken, on one side, and bread, cake, plum pudding, or pastry on the other ; it is designed to hold two pint bottles, one for champagne or claret (those of Messrs. Barton & Co., the well-known wine-merchants of 59, St. James^ Street, S.W., we strongly recommend), the other for sherry or Salutaris water. Instead of two tumblers and two small glasses, which take up much room, it is fitted with two large and two small cups of transparent horn, fitting one inside the other, and taking up the room of one tumbler only; they are exceedingly light, clean, and nice. It is, of course, fitted with pepper, salt, and mustard, knives, forks, two plates, and a portable table is fastened outside, which he considers is a great ad- vantage, in fact an absolute necessity for comfort.

io8 BREAKFASTS, LUNCHEONS, AND BALL SUPPERS. MUTTON, HASHED. No. 135. Cut some thin slices from a roast leg of mutton, put an ounce of butter into a stewpan, add two small onions, a little parsley, and a pickled walnut chopped fine; let these ingredients fry for two or three minutes, being careful not to burn any of them, stir in a table-spoonful of flour until quite smooth, when add three-quarters of a pint of Consomme (No. 27) ; let the whole boil up, stirring until it does so, when put it on the side and let it simmer for fifteen minutes. Strain, add a table-spoonful of mushroom or walnut catsup, a squeeze of lemon, and a tea-spoonful of Searcy Salt; put the meat into the sauce, and let it stew for three-quarters of an hour. If it boils, it makes it hard, and spoils it. MUTTON, HARICOT OF. No. 136. Cut the cutlets of a neck of mutton into the same shapes and sizes as for broiling, fry them in a saute pan in an ounce of butter, just browning each side; put them in a stewpan, and add to the butter a table-spoonful of flour and incorporate it smoothly ; add a quart of Stock (No. 27), bring it to the boil, and put it into the stewpan with the cutlets ; cut into balls two turnips, three carrots, add a dozen small onions, and fry the whole in an ounce of butter until browned, when put them also into the stewpan, flavour with pepper and salt, and let the whole stew until tender. MUTTON POTATO PIE. No. 137. Trim some mutton cutlets from the best part of a neck of mutton, pepper and salt each, and lay them in layers in a potato-pie dish with a layer of sliced onion and potato between each; fill the dish full up with some Stock (No. 27), put the perforated cover on the top, and cover it over with some mashed potato an inch and a half thick, bake an hour, and serve.

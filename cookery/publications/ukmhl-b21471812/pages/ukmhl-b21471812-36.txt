CHAPTER III. BREAKFASTS FOR PEOPLE OF ROBUST CONSTITUTION, SPORTSMEN, AND THOSE WHO TAKE MUCH EXERCISE. To such fortunate classes the Author can only say, it matters little what they eat or drink, if their digestion is as good as their appetites ; he strongly recommends them, however, to drink tea, coffee, or cocoa, and not claret or beer. The Author has always heard that the late Sir Tatton Sykes frequently breakfasted on "apple tart,'' washed down by "home-brewed ale." Chacun a son goiit. He doubts very much if it was frequently, if there is any truth in the legend at all; and although he feels the greatest respect for the memory of this most worthy and ex- cellent of baronets, he has not put such a Bill of Fare amongst his menus. Any one caring to try such a break- fast must cater for himself The same rules, as to bread, fruits, jams, and table requisites, as in the preceding chapters should be observed. To avoid repetition the Author has only given twelve Bills of Fare, as a sort of guide to cooks what to send up. Selection from " Breakfasts for Large Parties " can easily be made in the winter, and in the summer meat really is not necessary. Broiled Co.l Devilled Beefsteak. Broiled Mushrooms. Omelet au Jus.

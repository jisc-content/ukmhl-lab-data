CHAPTER XII. EGGS AND OMELETS. TO BOIL. No. 13. Eggs to be good should not be more than two days old ; after that they lose the creamy substance over the yolk which makes an egg so delicious. A new-laid egg takes a minute longer to boil than one which has been laid some days, and if you wish the white set it should be put in boiling water and allowed to boil four minutes and a half. If you prefer the white running all over your plate, and dropping all over your dress on the way to your mouth, let it boil three minutes and a half. BUTTERED EGGS AU JUS. No. 14. Melt in an enamelled saucepan two ounces of butter, add a table-spoonful of cream, remove it from the fire, and break into the saucepan four eggs; flavour with pepper and salt, put the saucepan on the fire, and stir the whole with a wooden spoon until the mixture mixes like custard, being careful it does not curdle. Fry in butter some toast in squares of three inches, and put a table-spoonful of the mixture on each, and serve with three or four table-spoonfuls of Clear Brown Sauce (No. 35), slightly reduced.

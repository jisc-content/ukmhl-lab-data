71 TEA, COFFEE, COCOA. COCOA. No. 12. Cocoa nibs, like coffee, are better fresh roasted ; so if you have a coffee-roaster you can procure the cocoa beans, roast and rub them through a sieve. The quantity used should be half a teacup of nibs to a pint of water. Directions to Make. Put half a teacup of nibs to every pint of water, put the nibs in a common coffee-pot and pour the boiling water on them, put it on the fire and let it boil up, when put it on the side to simmer for three or four hours. Strain it, and it will keep for some days. The chief reason cocoa is seldom good is that it is not stewed long enough. There is not time to make it before breakfast, unless it is put on at six o'clock; as this is seldom the case, a poor, watery, weak mess is generally produced. To serve, make it very hot, send in with it some boiling milk, and pour out as Cafe au Lait.

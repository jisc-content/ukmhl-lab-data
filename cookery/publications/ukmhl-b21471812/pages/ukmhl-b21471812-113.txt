FISH AU GRATINS. 99 brown. Stew the beards and hard parts in the liquor, strain through a fine colander, and add an equal proportion of Brown Sauce (No. 35), and reduce to half-glaze ; add a squeeze of lemon, a little cayenne pepper, and serve with the kabobs. PERCH, BROILED. No. 97. Wash, scale, clean as many perch as required, about one pound each (allow one for each person), split down the centre of the back in half, take out the back-bone as clean as possible; pepper and salt, and broil on a wire gridiron over or before a clear fire, and rub with soft butter just before serving. PLAICE, FILLET OF. No. 98. Clean, skin, wash, and fillet a plaice in the same way as soles are filleted; if over two pounds, the fillets must be divided in two or three pieces, egg and crumb, and fry in boiling lard. SALMON, TO FILLET. No. 99. Cut off the head and the tail five inches from the end, cut the salmon in half, dividing down the back (the knife must be very sharp); take out the back and all the long bones, cut the salmon in neat cutlets of about half an inch thick—a salmon about six pounds is the best size. The tail can be boiled and not wasted—used for coquille or kedgeree. A salmon filleted in this way will make several di.shes. SALMON, BROILED. No. 100.

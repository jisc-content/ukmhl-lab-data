126 BREAKFASTS, LUNCHEONS, AND BALL SUPPERS. HARE, CIVET OF. No. 190. Trim and cut a raw hare into fillets, cut half a pound of streaky bacon into squares double the size of dice, put the whole into a saute pan with two ounces of butter, and fry for ten minutes. Mix in two table-spoonfuls of flour and add a bottle of claret and a pint of Stock (No. 27). Let the whole boil for ten minutes, strain, wash the fillets in a tumbler of claret and put them in a clean stewpan, pass the stock again through a sieve, and add to it the fillet-garnish with five onions, with three cloves in one of them, a bouquet of parsley, thyme, four bay leaves, and six shalots. Let the whole stew until tender (about two hours), remove the garnish, add two dozen small mushrooms, and incorporate with the stock the blood of the hare, which must have been kept.

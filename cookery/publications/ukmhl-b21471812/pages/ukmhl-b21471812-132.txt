CHAPTER XVIII. POULTRY AND GAME. TO BONE. No. i6i. Put the bird with the breast downwards, the back upwards, on the table, with the head towards you ; with a sharp cook's knife cut a straight line down the back through the skin and flesh to the bone. Release with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand the skin and flesh on the left side nearest you, and with the right hand keep cutting away the flesh from the bone, pulling it away clear as it is cut with the left hand; when the wing joint is arrived at, cut the joint clean away and continue cutting close to the bone until .all the meat from the left breast is released, when return to the back and continue to clear the meat in the same way until the leg is reached, when twist it round, which will enable you to get the skin over it and arrive at the joint, which cut away from the body bone. Proceed with the right side in the same way, only use your left hand to cut, your right hand to pull the meat away, and the bird is clear of the carcase. Lay the bird flat on the table, inside upwards, when cut out the wing bone and proceed to the legs ; cut the meat on the inside of each thigh down to the bone, and clear the meat from the bone, cutting it each side until you can raise the bone out; when finished, cut up the inside of the drumstick to the bone, and proceed in the same way as in the thigh, when the bone can be taken out, and the bird, free of bone, is ready for use.

WATER ICES. CURRANT AND RASPBERRY. No. 248. Simmer for a few minutes in a preserving pan three pounds of stripped rec^turrants and one pound of rasp- berries in a gill of wate^ and either beat them through a hair sieve or put them through one of Adams' Fruit Pressers. Add to the juice one pint of syrup, made thus : " Put four pounds of lump sugar in a sugar boiler, and add to it one quart of water, whisked up with half the white of an egg; allow the sugar to dissolve, stirring it up, put it on the fire and stir it with a sugar spoon until it boils, put it on the side of the fire, and by degrees, as it boils, keep adding another pint of water—this process makes the egg come to the top, and after boiling a minute or two the syrup will become quite clear and bright"—and freeze.

POULTRY AND GAME. 119 TO FILLET COOKED GAME OR POULTRY. No. 162. Cut the bird in half with a large sharp knife straight clown the middle of the breast bone; lay each half on the table and take out the breast bone from each side. If for cold luncheons, such as shooting or racing, or for devils, and the bird be a small one, such as a grouse or partridge, chop off the wing bone to within an inch of the meat, and the leg bones to the meat on the drum- stick, and trim all skin neatly round, and the bird is ready to serve. If a chicken, guinea-fowl, pheasant, or duck, after having removed the breast bone, cut the legs from the wings, the pinion bones off to within an inch of the meat, and trim each neatly round the bone ; and if a large chicken or duck, divide into two fillets, cut the leg in two, chopping the drumstick off close to the meat. Trim the fillets and joints neatly round; there should be no skin hanging round the edges. For ball suppers or for chaufroix, the legs should be boned and the fillets cut smaller, and for the latter, all skin removed. It depends, of course, on the size of the bird, the number of fillets which can be cut from each joint; for instance, in a large chicken, each wing and thigh can be cut into at least three parts. The drumsticks should not be used unless absolutely required. The neatness of the dishes depends on the filleting, and great care is necessary. CHICKEN, TO BRAISE. No. 163. Truss a chicken, cover it with layers of fat bacon, put It in a braising or stew-pan with a quart of White Stock (No. 28), two carrots, two onions quartered, and half a stick of celery; bring it to the boil at once, put it on the side of the fire, and let it simmer for fifty minutes

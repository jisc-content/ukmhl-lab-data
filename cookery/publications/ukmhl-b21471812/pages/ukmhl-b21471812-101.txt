CHAPTER XIV, CLEAR SOUPS. CONSOMME A LA ROYAL. No. 63. Poach in a frying-pan as many pieces of Chicken Quenelle Meat (No. 187),* cut into diamond shapes, as are required, poach in water, and throw into the tureen of Consomme (No 27) ; flavour to taste with sugar and salt. CONSOMME. No. 64. Serve in tureen as much plain Consomme (No. 27) as is required, only serve it hot, and not half cold, as is generally the case at balls. CONSOMME TORTUE. No. 65. In selecting dried turtle be careful to pick the thickest pieces ; soak as much as is required in warm water, letting it stand by the side of the fire for forty-eight hours, changing the water every six hours. After this scald and thoroughly clean it, scraping the inside, and cutting off all the ragged edges. Cut it into squares of an inch, and put it into a stewpan with one pint of Consomme (No. 27) to a pound, and a bag containing a tea-spoonful of basil, six peppercorns, and a little salt; hermetically seal or exclude all air from the stewpan, put it in a bain-marie of boiling * " The Pytchley Cookery Book."

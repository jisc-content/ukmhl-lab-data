BALL SUPPERS. CHAPTER IX. Ball Suppers, like other repasts, require some care, some management, some taste to be displayed, to be really nice. In the winter a clever cutlet is a luxury, but unless the establishment is large I should almost advise that everything should be cold, soups of course excepted. Cold suppers are much more easily served, and a hot meal so soon after dinner is hardly required. Everything, except perhaps a ham or two and a game pie, should be neatly filleted or cut up. Fish, poultry, game, etc., should be neatly arranged in aspic or chaufroix, or if plain with slices of ham or tongue between each fillet, and salads of some kind arranged in the centre of all cold dishes. Galantines, Ballotines in the same manner should be sliced with alternate slices of ham or tongue, and garnished with chopped aspic or salad de legumes. I should also strongly advise that suppers should be served on several small tables in preference to one large one, and that a dish of each sort should adorn each table. Fill the room, and close it until the tables have been rearranged, as nothing looks so uncomfortable as to see the remnants of bread, etc., left on the tables. It is easily done in a very few moments, and it makes all the difference in the success of the affair. I shall give only four Bills of Fare. Any one who gives more than fozir balls in one year will probably be in a lunatic asylum before the next, so will not require more.

BREADS, ETC. 65 bake either for about an hour and a half. Take out of the oven, and let the loaves get cold, placing them on their side, or upside down. WHITE BREAD. No. 2. The same, only use best white or second flours and omit the butter. FRENCH ROLLS. TWISTS. RINGS. FINGERS. No. 3. Dissolve one ounce of German yeast in half a pint oi tepid milk, and work in sufficient flour to make a thick ball of paste ; place the ball into a basin containing about a pound and three-quarters of white flour, previously mixed with half an ounce of Borwick's baking powder; cover it with a cloth and set it by the fire to rise; when it has risen, which will be in about twenty minutes, add by degrees a pint of tepid milk, working in the flour and kneading it well, until it becomes a smooth elastic dough; flour a pastry-board, and form it with your hands into either small round or oval rolls, twists, rings, or fingers. Place them on a baking tin, cover them with paper, and put them in a warm place to rise; brush them over with milk and bake in a quick oven for about twenty minutes ; the size, however, makes some slight difference, so they require attention. LUNCHEON ROLLS. No. 4. Dissolve half an ounce of German yeast in a pint of tepid water; mix in two pounds of flour, cover with a. cloth, and let the dough rise in a warm place ; when it has risen knead it well, and form it into small round balls; if for filling with fish or salads they should be not larger than two inches in diameter.

CASES IN SURGERY. By JAMES SPENCE, Surgeon. FROM THK MONTHLY .lOUKNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE, FOR FEBRUARY 1848. Case I.â€”Case of Ligature of the Axillary Artery for Hemorrhage resulting from a Burn of the Arm. David Henderson, ast. nine years, met with a severe burn of his left arm, on the 20th December 1845, owing to his clothes taking fire. In the absence of Mr Kerr, the usual medical attendant of the family, another medical gentleman dressed the wound with cotton wadding ; but owuig to the offensive smell of the discharge, and to see the full extent of the injury, ^Ir Kerr removed this after some days. He then found that the true skui was very severely injm-ed, and that the bmni extended from the lower part of the axilla to near the hand, and in the upper arm was chiefly situated towards the inner side. Stimulating applications and poultices were now used, and in a short time sloughs separated from the injured surface above and below the bend of the arm, and the sore healed kindly enough at several points. At the bend of the arm, the sloughs were very deep and long in separating, and Mr Kerr watched their separation with considerable anxiety for fear of hemorrhage taking place. On the evening of the 6th of January 1846, a portion of slough came away, and was followed by considerable loss of blood. Mr Kerr and Dr Duncan saw the boy shortly after this, and as the bleeding was then evidently venous, they arrested it by bandagmg from the fingers upwards, and placing a graduated compress over the bleeding point. This completely arrested it until the evening of the 8th Januaiy, when a deeper portion of slough separating, sud- den and profuse hemorrhage took place ; Mr Kerr attended almost immediately, and seeing tlie bleeding was now arterial, arrested it EDINBUROH: SUTHERLAJJT> and KNOX, 08, PBINCB8 STREET.

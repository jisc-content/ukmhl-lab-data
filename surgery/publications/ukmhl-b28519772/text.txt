However respectful the manner may be in which the author refers to Hunter, Denman, &c. it is very much of a fact that he received from the authorities alluded to but slender aid, their ideas being rather indeterminate and equi- vocal, by no means moulded into the form of a doctrine, or assuming the order of a principle. They appear to be rather an incidental conjec- ture than a digested result of a scientifick view. The author brings before the reader some of the many errours of writers, especially those of his own country, on the Yellow fever, not omit- ting to point out as he passes on, the facility with which even learning and character are in- fluenced by the magick power of a name. The gratuitous doctrines of Dr. Jones of Lon- don, on the Pathology of wounded Arteries, is6 not passed by in silence ; nor does the writer forget the suppositious Aneurism of Philadel- phia—that in which so much is said to suggest to a prudent understanding the advantage and propriety of always, vvith care, noting the mark- ed distance between opinion 'dndfact. The author intends to pursue his plan of fur- nishing sketches or out lines of correctives on certain errours of modern works ; and although his talents may not be fully adequate to a suc- cessful management of the vast mass of materi- als provided to his hand, he has some hopes arising from his industry and application. It is not to be understood that his hopes are very great of adding much to the fertility of the fair field of medical science, by directing through it many copious streams of knowledge from new and unexplored sources : he Vv^ill have the mea- sure of his expectations filled up, if he can suc- ceed in giving a proper diversion to the inundat- ing tide that has been for years setting in upon it. To act negatively is not at all times to act uselessly.—To be disabused of old errours is to be put into the way to acquire new truths.dissertatio physiologica DE CAUSIS CATAMEMIORUM QUAM ANNUENTE SUMMO NUMINE ET AtJCTORlTATE DIGNISSIMI VICE-CANCELLARII ARCHIBALDI DAVIDSON, S.

Omnibus vero rite et considerate perpensis, pauca de catame^ nils proponere mecum statui. Quibus ex cau» sis oritur hie sanguinis fluxus, certo setatis tem- pore, vel quid sit naturae huic respondens con- silium, in corpore feeminino, nemo adhuc, sive medicus, sive physiologus, pro certo dicere au- sus est. Inter facultates aut functiones corpo- ris humani nulla est de qua difficilius ratio red- di potest. Multi quidem physiologi, turn vete- res, turn recentiores, adhanc rem explorandam^ operam dederunt: ibi vero, me saltern judice, labor eorum omnis effusus est, si quas in lucem ediderunt hodierni observationes excipiantur. R10 1 ihil quidem, de hac re, novi, pauca lantum, quibu§„$ententias Hunteri, Denmani, aliorum que medicorum stabilire et coniirmare possum- us, in animo est mihi proferre. Hoc modo igi- tui, ut spero, ex memoria hominiim dctrahere et oblivioni setern^ tradere istas opiniones falsas ccque ac absurdas quae tamdiu animis eorum ar- risere, nonnihil valebo. Inter tot tamque diversas opiniones, quarum nonnullae a viris illustribus traditac sunt, quid sit veruiii, quid falsum, ut juvenem et tyronem dccet, explorare conabor. R.em vero religioni non habebo, quod interdum a sententiis medi- corum, etiam clarissimorum discederem. Me hisce verbis utente, quin invidiam, forsitan et contumeliam mihimet paravero, baud incertus sum. His autem magis ire obviam, quam fal- sum pro vero positum indecoro silentio praeter- ire volo. Hujus rationem fluxus reddere vel potilis attentionem nominum ad rationes exque- rendas incitare, mihi consilium est. Propter sententias ab aliis diversas, hac in dissertatione prolatas, me facere insignem, si possit fieri, non in animo est. Ne quis igitur vitio vertat, si o- pinionibus aliorum non semper accederem. Qua modestia viriumque suarum diffident!a uti juve- nem decet, suam de rebus omnibus non minus quam medicis, sententiam in lucem prodentem, non omnino ignoro. Hie vero recordari nos oportet, tyrones ssepe ac imperitos, quic maxi'11 mo sunt usui vitasque humanas accommodatissi- ma, multa feliciter invenisse. Hanc lamen rem adeo obsciiram non confidentissime aggredior. Quud si quae dicenda sint, ad justas causas men- sium fluxus, vel, ut jam dixi, animos hominuni eas explorare quoquomodo diicant, satis habeo. Non ab re alienum videbitur, observationes tradere perpaucas de sententiis eorum qui de catameniis scripserunt. Imprimis autem, de signis et mutationibus quae primiim mensium fluxum praecedunt et comitantur, pauca praemit- tere necesse erit. Vix dicere possum, an alia ulla in natura sit ^ operatio, varios inter ordines sive plantarum sive animalium, quae tarn varios tamque diver- sos edit effectus, quam quas subit puella muta- tiones tempore pubertatis. Totum fere corpus mutatur. Forma puellae universa magis jit gra- cilis, crescit magnitudine uterus, pubes venit, mammas eiflorescunt, pulchrior renidet vultus, splendent oculi, incessus, gestus, sermo, omnia denique Hunt magis decora. Tempus, quo primum menses erumpunt^ non omnibus idem est; variat enim regionis tem- perie, vitae conditione forsitan et multis aliis causis. Maturius pubescunt puellae in regioni- bus calidis, in frigidis vero tardius. In region- ibus calidis, menses quoque multa citius quam in frigidis sese manifestant. Hoc puellis Asia-12 ticis annum retatis octavum vel nonum agenti- l^s, accidere dicitur: quo tempore, fceminse fi- unt,^ priusque matres factae sunt, quam annum aemtis decimum compleverint. In regionibus frigidis multo serius accidit, neque, exceptis paucissimis exemplis, primum se ostendit ante annum setatis vkessimum. Quantum variat tempus quo primum eveni- unt menses, in diversis regionibus, tantum va- riat quantitas sanguinis ejecti. In regionibus frigidissimis, tres uncias, in calidioribus usque ad sexdecim, per mensium fluxum, mulieres amittunt. Certam pro regionis situ proportio- nem ratam spectat hujus fluxus quantitas. In his regionibus, nempe in Britannia, sex vel oc- to uncise sanguinis, singulis mensibus, hoc mo- do, fluere censentur, PuellsB B*itannic8R, sana valitudine fruentes, circiter annum setatis decimum quartum vel quin- tum, primum mensium fluxum patiuntur. Quo tempore, languor, et lassitudo insolita, pandicu- latio, dolor lumborum, ventriculi, et capitis, vertigo, nausea, interdum et vomitio, tumor mam- xnarum aliquando et dolor, aliaque his signa similia puellam fatigant. Haec signa jam recen- sita mensium fluxum in genere prsecedunt, du- rantque nisi per intervalla brevia, donee sanguis cx cavo uteri prorumpit. Si vero, hoc tempore, aliquid exitui ejus per uterum obstet, fluxus est ex naribus, pulmonibus, ventriculo, ano, ocu- lis, gingivis, mammis, urabilico, minimo manus13 digito, aliquando et aliis insuetis corporis par- tibus.^ Sanguinem, ex utero, tempore mensium flu- entum, esse sincerum, putaverunt nonnulli. De hac re, autem, maxime dubito: alii enim, hunc sanguinem menstruum non esse congulabilem, neque ullam habere similitudinem sanguinis sin- ceri naturje, nisi color! ejus, asseruerunt. De his, autem, mox plura dicenda sunt. Hie sanguinis fiuxus, mulieribus per mag*;* nam vitse partem naturalis est, et valetudini ea^ rum maxime necessarius, siftgulis mensibus oa- currit, si uterum non gerunt, quo tempore, ra=! rissime se manifestat. Non desunt qui, men^ ses, more solito, per totum graviditatis tempus, permansisse memorias tradiderunt. Sed paucis- simis in exemplis, quibus res ita sese habuer- unt, tale profluvium pro hemorrhagic morbida censeri debetur : forsitan et ex arteriis uterinis^ minime effunditur, sed ex vasis in vaginam hh antibus. Satis enim constat, quo tempore, con- ceperit mulier, os uteri, materia mucosa, oc- clusum esse. Sanguis igitur, more mensium solito, ex cavo uteri gravidi, fluere non potest. Hujuscemodi profluvia, maxima, tenero embry- oni, incommoda, mortemque, fortasse ipsam, af- ferrent. Menses quo ex tempore, mulieribus primum contingunt, certis intervallis redeuntes, perque * Vide De Grsid, page 1J9,14 triiim, quatuor, aliquando et sex dierum spati- um fluentes, vix ante quadragessimum quin- tum et fere ante quinquagessimum aetatis an- num. desinunt. Sed quibusdam in casibus ad provectiorem actatem fluere perstant. Non de- siint exempla, quamvis rarissima, qitibus men- ses sub pubertatem proruperunt. Medicus ille Alexander Monro pater, de quadam puella, mentionem fecit, cui menses occurerunt, tertio quidem anno aitatis.^ DE CAUSIS EXCITANTIBUS. De mensium causis, varias multumque inter se diversas opiniones, in scriptis medicorum in- venimus. Multa quidem vana et futilia, turn de causis, turn de effectibus eorum, tiradiderunt physiologi. Causae eorum, ut quibusdam visum est, ex cursibus lunaribus deducendae sunt, Alii, autem, probare conati sunt, eas in bile ex- istere. Plerique, vero, inter recentiores, medi- ci, de hac re disceptantes, vel ex cong^estione sanguinis uterini, vel plethora corporis univer- sali, vel partibus corporis jam evolutis, vel ar- teriarum densitate, causas quaesiverunt. Ho- die quidem, multi, menses oriri, ex una vel alte- ra harumcausarum quas nunc enumeravi, se ha- bent persuasos. Nostro autem judicio, qui pu- tant, menses esse secretionem ex arteriis uter- inis, quae pendet ex conditione ovariorum pecu- liar!, proprius ad veritatem accesserunt! Nunc vero, pauca, de rationibus, quibus, suas, de • VidCj page 422.iiac re, opiniones confirmare potuerint medici, in lucem proferam. Vix opus est verbis, opinionem refellere, de Kinse effectibus in mensibus cicndis. Si enim luna hoc efficere valeat, mulieribus omnibus, eodem fere tempore, menses contingerent. Sane res ita non hunt. Namque, omnibus cursus lu- naris temporibus, hunc mensium fluxum pad solent mulieres. Igitur, quam medicus Mead male finxit, de vi lunfe pro mensium causa opin- ionem ut falsam seque aciabsurdam rejicere de- bemus. Quare autem rogare volo, menses non fluunt ante annum fetatis decimum quartum vel quintum, atque post quinquagessimum desi- nunt, quoniam corpus foemininum, pertotum vi- tm spatium, vi luhse eadem semper afficiatur ? Hie, ut mihi videtur, "homines ad vana fingenda, quam ad rerum naturam investigandam pronior- es opinionibus tarn absurdis fidem habere ad- dueti sunt. Alii vero physiologi, hac de re, disceptantes, hoc errore relicto, in alium abierunt. Scyllam cupientes evitare, in Charybdim inciderunt. O- pinionem, menses originem ducere ex rimia bi- lls copia, vel ex natura bills: peculiari, non vero rationibus validioribus, neque observationibus magis certis, qaidem protulerunt. Sed ut su- pra dixi, plura faeere verba, has opiniones es- se falsas ostendere, non erit necesse.16 Ad aiiam, de mensium causis, opinionem, animum advertamus. Menses ut quibusdam videtur, ex congestione sanguinis in uteri vasis, oriri censentur. Medici vero hanc opinionem proferentes, quo pacto fit, ut hsBc sanguinis congestio, quse, parvis incrementis in molem facta, certissimis intervallis prorumperet, non nobis dixerunt. Pro certo habeatur, ut pletho- ra in aliqua corporis parte partialis brevi fiet universalis. Nunc autem de hac plenitudine corporis universali, a plerisque hominibus pro mensium causis habita, fusius dicam. Pauci quidem ante tempus praeclari Culleni, hanc opinionem ita investigaverunt, ut rei adeo obscurse multum lucis attulerunt. Culle- nus vero ipse, quamvis, acumine ingenii soli- to, hanc rem explicare conatus est, tamen cali- gine atra obvolutam reliquit. Sententiam ejus pro mera hypothesi habere oportet; tamen lu- bentissime concedam esse hypothesin ingenios- issimam. Asserit ille uterum esse evolutum post alias corporis partes; et igitur hse partes sanguini a corde demisso resistentes, in laxa va» sa uteri eum nempe sanguinem determinant; hsec vasa cedentia impetui sanguinis impingen- tis, donee tandem rumpuntur, exitusque ad san- guinis Iluxum datur; atque, ut ait ille, alia fit accumulatio per mensis spatium. Sic ille disse- ruit. Sed baud scio unde oritur ha3c nimia san- guinis abundantia quse mulieribus omnibus in eadein regione degentibus, eodem tetatis tern-17 pore, congeritur, et singulis mensibus fluere perstat, donee arteri?e uterinse tarn firmse densse que faetje, sanguinis exitum omnino impediunt. Ad opinioncm eorum; qui putant mensium causas oriri' ex plcnltudine corporis, quse a qua- d,am conditione ovariorum pendet hand facile accedam ; neque aliam plenitudinem prseter na- turam, in corpora existere,: credere possum. Cetcrum affirmat Cullenus, arterias uterinas non esse equales, quoad firmitatem vel densita- tem, arteriis aliarum corporis partium, sed lax-., iores et infirmiores esse: atque satis constat, incrementum omnis corporis partis ex toto pen- dereafiuxn sanguinis in earn demisso. Uterus vero, putat ille, tardius evolvitur aliis corporis partibus, et hoc tempore, determinatio est san- guinis ad uterum, cujus arteriis impetui san- guinis cedentibus, menses fluunt, et fluere per- stabunt, solids intervallis, donee arterise uteri tarn denste et flrmse fiunt, ut sanguini ab aliis corporis partibus demisso resistere valeat, quod accidit cum menses desinunt. Nunc autem observandum est, -quam maxime erravit Cullenus, cum rationes, de hac re red- deret. Nam si alise corporis partes firmse ac validse factae impetui sanguinis resistunt, et cum in vasa uteri laxiora et infirmiora determi- nant, non possit fieri, ut hte partes, figuram Rustam, et firmitatem adeptte, - post mensuim C18 fluxmn magis increscerent. Res vero aliter se habent. Satis enim constat, totum fere corpus miili- ebre, postquam menses accidcrint, magna incrc- menta accipere, et quibusdam in casibus, quoad lormam, figuram, et firmitatem multum mutari. His igitur rite perpensis, fidem opinioni Culleni habere non possum, menses a successione evo- lutionis, utdicitille, pendere. Ad quam protulit Charletonus, de hac re, opinionem, nunc animum advertamiis. Putat ille, menses originem habere a quodam spiritu nitro aereo. Ejus verba sunt, “ Utut hac res “ se habeat^ mihi qiiidem verisimile mdetm\ spu ritum nitro aereum in hoc opere chorugum esse; luihemas itaque tandem jam verisimilem saltern^ si non ^erum menstrui ardoris in iitero midie- ** bri originem,^^ Valde miror, quomodo fieret, ut Charletonus, eiToribus et falsis sententiis Hyppocratis, Gal- leni, aliorumque antiquorum, ab illo in lucem prolatis, repudiatis, opinioni tarn absurdfe hdem haberet. Plic vero nobis attulit certissima docu- menta, quo facilius est hominibus, errores aii- orum exponere quam veritatem investigare: male facere, qui vuit, nusquam non causam in veniet. Hisce igitur observationibus de sententiis ali- orum jam traditis, rem, ut se habet, quoad po'19 lero, ill animo est mihi tractare. Atque ut s,o- leiit sapientissimi mortalium, quiim in rebus du- biis et obscuris investigandis versantur et viam ad veritatem tramite recto, persequi nequeunt, quam habcnt aliis rebus magis “apertis et per- spicuis analogiam invenire conantur. Horum exemplo adductus de re adhuc satis obscura^ meam quoque sententiam in medium proferam, Neminem latet, omnes hiimani corporis se- cretiones ex toto pendere a conditione organi se- cernentis perfecta, et priiis organum ad condi- tionem perfectam pervenit, quam secretiones il- li proprias perficere potest: cseterisque paribus, quo magis alicujus organi conditio, eo melius suas pr?estat functiones. Exempli gratia, con- ditio peculiaris hepatis, testium, et mammarum, pro bilis, seminis, et lactis, secretione, maxi- me necessaria est. Hand scio, quibus ex cau- sis oriuntur menses, si non signa censentur cer- ta, quibus certiores facti sumiis, uterum esse perfectum et ovaria evoluta, atque ad munera sibi propria perficienda, apta. Menses semper fluxerunt, ante quam miilier uterum gerit. Nos- tro autem judicio, non pro causis, ut nos docii- it professor Simpson, sed tantum pro signis pie- nse pubertatis hie fluxus haberetur. Ratio igitur in promptu erit, cur menses mu- lieribus non citius contingunt. Quare, rogare volo, neque semen secernitur pueris, neque lac puellis, quinto vel sexto a3tatis anno ? Huic res-20 pondeatur, quia testes et mammae, organa istos hiimores sccernentia, ad conditionem perfectam, qua suis propriis muneribus fungantur, non ad- huc pervenerunt. Sed, ut supra memoravi, nonnulli auctores, turn vetcres, turn recentiores se habent persua- sos, menses oriri ex plenitudine corporis vel iiniversali vel partiali, quae, tempore puberta- tis maxime valet. Quo fit, ut omnibus puellis certa aetate, inque eadem regione, menses ac- ciderint, difficile erit ex hac opinione rationem reddere. Satis enim constat, ut puellae, quam- cunque vitam agant, vel qualicunque victu utaii- tantur, hunc mensium fluxum patiuntur. Et si quando menses, solito tempore, non fluxerint, tamen naturse conamina ad hoc efficiendum non omnino deficiunt. Unde igitur oritur hfec corporis plenitude qiue longe latequc grassatur ; cui obnoxise et oppor- tunse sunt omnes puellce, cujuscunque tempera- menti, sive vitam in urbe aut in rure agerent, sive laute viverent, aut tenui et parciore victu uterentur ? Si autem menses neque ex lunse imperio, ne- que bile, neque spiritu nitro aereo, neque ex plenitudine corporis proficiscuntur, quibus ex causis oriuntur? Qua ex causa oritur seminis secretio ex vasis spermatids? Certe ex conditi- one testium faecundante. Eodem quoque mo-21 do, mensium fluxus a conclitione ovariorum cundantc pendet. Fluxus iste igitur censeri de- bet secretio ex arteriis uteri quibus stimulo est conditio ovariorum perfecta. Joannes Bell ean- dem opinionem praelectiones suas anatomicas audientibus tradidit. Professor Munro, medicus celeberrimus, cum sententias de hac re, in suis prselectionibus uti- lissimis proferret, menses a peculiari ovariorum conditione pendere, asseruit. Idem vir illustris addere vult, hanc condiiionem ovariorum pie- nitudinem corporis universalem efficere. Certe scio, cum discederem a sententiis hujus .viri clarissimi, ut homines arrogantiam, fortasse et ignorantiam, mihi attribuent. Mihi vero non est consilium, si fieri possit, aliquid detrahere nomini ejus, quern plurimi facio, ct maximum et solertissimum medicum lubentissime agnos- €o. Non cupidus novi, sed rerum causas cog- noscendi, ab illo dissentio. Et si in hoc erra- verim, omnes bonos ac candidos iterum iterum-f que oratos volo, ut ne mihi vitio vertant, et me amore veritatis captum in errorem adductum, esse meminissent. Cum Professore Munrone, de hae re, doctis- simo et ingeniosissimo Professor! Jacobo Gre- gory in sententiis prcelectionum suarum traditis, convenire placet. Putat ille quoque plenitudi- nem corporis, ex qua oritur mensium fluxus,22 quadam conclitione ovariorum effici. Sed quo- modo fit hcec plenitudo in corpora, neque hie, neque ille, demonstravit, et quomodo fiat cori- fiteor me omnino ignorare. Diffidens animi hanc rem aggredior ; namque bene scio meas vires earn tractare, ut vellem;i non sufficere. Tamen nos oportet cavere ne addiceremur in verba jurare ullius magistri ; me enim judicante, mnltum est periculi, et hand ignarus sum, ut medici et philosophi nomina et auctoritates magnorum virorum pro validis rati- onibus ssepe adducunt, et nos opinionibus eorum magnis nominibus et auctoritatibus tantum fir- matis assentire volunt. Mon quidem est tyro- nis, sine ulla investigatione fidem habere sen- tentiis aliorum. Si enim res ita esset, vera sci- entia semper fuisset inculta ; de circulatione san- guinis, de curatione variolse, aut de vasis lym- phaticis, nostras ad aures nihil unquam perve- nisset. Nunc igitur in animo est mihi meas sententi- as, de mensium causis, proferre, ut alios ma- jore ingenii acumine dotibusque animi prsestan- tioribus prseditos operam dare huic rei investi- gandse, excitem. Quamvis enim nonnulli pu- taverunt rem tarn obscuram nunquam in lucem proferri posse ; tamen sperare possum, tempus non multum abesse quum erit manifesta; et for- tasse invenietur, menses oriri ex conditione ova-23 riorum fnscundante, quae est stimulo arteriis ute- ri, ex quibus iste humor secernitur. Multa quidem animum ad hanc opinionem ducunt. Nullas novimus puellas viro tempes- tivas, quibus menses non accederint. Aliis quoque animalibus lex est hujusmodi * In priore parte hujus opusculi, jam observa- vi menstruum sanguinem non esse coagulabi- lem more sanguinis sinceri, et huic sanguini nullam habere similitudinem nisi rubedini ejus. De hac re, autem, nunquam mihi dabatur oc- casio ulla experimenta faciendi. Ex experimen- ts aliis institutis hoc accepi. Quamvis autem. sanguis menstruus esset sincerus, ex hoc de- monstrari non potest, plenitudinem adesse, vel quomodo arteriae uterinae partem sanguinis a general! massa separare possunt. Si vox plethora audit justam et ratam sangui- nis quantitatem, quae distention! et action! va- sorum necessaria est, non ut vulgo significat conditionem corporis morbidam, in hoc sensu vox est absurda. Plethora in posteriore sensu tantum notat conditionem morbidam et laxita- tem solidorum corporis indicat. Si accuratius dicere volumus vi aut stimulo uti debemus, quo iacilius lis dirimi possit. Satis constat, actiones omnium arteriarum a sanguine in iis contento ex toto pendere. lis * Vidft Spalanzani.24 sanguis est stimulo, quo functiones carum rite praestent. Haec quantitas sanguinis vasa sti- mulat in eodem modo ut calor, et haec quanti- tas sola necessaria est ovaria stimulare ad mu- nera propria perficienda. Ovaria sunt stimulo arteriis uterinis quae humorem menstruum se cernunt. Quo tempore primum menses erumpunt puel- iis, pubes venit, mammae turgent, incalescit uterus, genitalia suis functionibus apta sunt, quse omnia nobis sunt certissimis signis jam esse viro maturas. Si quando, ut supradixi, fluxus sanguinis per uterum impeditur, fluxus est ex ventriculo, pulmonibus, oculis, aliisque corpo- ris partibus. De his autem mox fusius dicam, Nunc pauca de recursibus mensium periodicis proferam. Plura dicere, de opinione eorum qui mensi- irm fluxum a lunae imperio pendere putaverunt, supervacaneum est. Quod dicendum est, de plenitudine partiali, seque ad uniyersalem spec- tat. Omnes enim affectiones hujusmodi primo partial.es, tandem flunt universales. De hisce igitur opinionibus, hoc in loco, simul agere in animo est; utpote sunt opiniones omnium fere medicorum, nonmulli quorum ante tempus Cul- leni plenitudinem esse torporis universalem de- monstrate conati sunt. Cullenus de plethora hypothesin finxit inge- niosam. Asseruit ille, primum mensium flux-25 um a densitate et firmitate arteriarum aliarum. corporis partiu.ni) sanguincm ad utcriim determinant. Arterim uteri jam evoluti laxio- res et infirmiores impetiii sanguinis cedentes, tandem rumpuntur et sanguis effunditur. Per intervallum mensisj alia est congestio, aliusc^ue fluxus; atque ut solet accidere aliis hemorrha- giis, recursus hujus fluxus, certis intervallis consuetudine confirmatus est. Cullenus autem, quo fit, ut hie fluxus tain accurate recurrat mensis intervallo, aut omni- bus fere foeminis in eadem regione, eadem as- sent intervalla, non demonstravit: nec quidem demonstravit, quomodo fit recursus alicujus he- morrhagite certis intervallis. Verbi gratia, fingamus plenitudinem adesse, atque octo uncias sanguinis per mensis spatium accumulari, et ex utero fluere. Cum ratione conveniet, si sexdecim unciae sanguinis, die decimo quarto ante tempus solitum, per venae sectionem auferantur, non erit fluxus antequam duo menses elapsi fuerint, vel mensis cum sem- isse. Si igitur causa hujus fluxus occasionalis ex congestione per mensis spatium facta origi- nem habet; duplice sanguinis quantitate per mensis intervallum detracta, triplex fere tempo- ris spatium elabi ante alium fluxum, necesse erit: quippe quod tempus duorum mensium ad congerendam sanguinis quantitatem detractione missam requiritur et prius pars tertii mensis D26' eiapsa fuerit, quam congestio et fluxus iterum acciderent. Sanguis autcm, hoc modo, missus, neque tcmpus neque quantitatem mutare potest. Medicus Simpson, ni fallor memoriae tradidit, decern libras per venae sectionem missas, quan- titate et intervallis menstrui Iluxus iisdem ma* nentibus. Ex his igitur, ut mihi videtur, menses a ple- netudine corporis non pendere, manifestum est. Aliud autem est argumentum ex eo quod acci- dit foeminae cui per errorem ovaria excidit Per- cival Pott. Ante hoc tempus huic foeminae menses rite et copiose fluxerunt. Postquam au- tem res tarn infelix evenerat, mammae subside- runt, omniaque signa solita mensium fluxum comitantia desiverunt, seque nunquam postea ostenderunt. Hisce igitur animo volventibus, dubitare non possum, quin menses majis pen- deant a conditione ovariorum, quse est stimulo utero, quam a plenitudine corporis. Nunc quomodo redeunt menses certissimis intervellis explicate oportet: Confiteor tamen, ut rationem hujus rei obscurae satis validam reddere non possum ; quamvis me habeo per- suasum ut explicari possit et rationem non mul- tum abesse. Cur non redeunt gratse vices diei noctisque intervallo hebdomadis vel mensis et non diei ? quia legibus hominibus aliisque ani- malibus impositis, stimulus ad suas functiones perficiendas necessarius, paucis horis diminui-tur, et quies et sopor ad eum reflcienduin sin- gulis diebus, requiruntur. Eadem ratione, hie fluxus singulis mensibus contingit foeminis. Si enim semel per anni spatium tantum accidisset, guadia hominis multum imminuta essent, et si nunquain accidisset, foeminae nunquam ute- riim gessissent: quia mensium fluxus ad secer- nendos humores faecundos neccssarius csset. In aliis animalibiis humor istiusmodi qui ex utero fluit non omnino deest. Qiio fit ut arteriae uterinae per paucas dies singulorum mensium hunc humorem peculiarem secernunt ? Eodem modo quo secernitur lac ex arteriis mammarum post omnem partum. Pu- tant nonnulli rem esse supra fidem tantum hujus humoris ex arteriis uteri secerni, quantum pau- cis diebus ex utero fluit. Non mirum est, si credere possumus quantum seminis secernitur ex spermaticis canis pro rato tempore in coitu. Menses, ut observatum fuit a nonnullis auc- toribus ex aliis corporis partibus fluxerunt; eo- demque modo, quibusdam in casibus, bilis per vesicam transit. Hie, hepatis, ille, uteri, mor- bidam conditionem demonstrat. Interdum quo* que bilis per ductum cholidochum impediatur. Nunc pauca dicenda sunt, cur menses circi- ter annum aetatis quadragessimiim quintum vel quinquagessimum amnino desinunt.

Alia ex causa oritur, ut mihi videtur, nempe, quia, hoc tempore, ovaria conditionem Jaecundantem omnino omittunt. Namque pro- videns natura posuit legem, ut menses fluere cessarent, et ovaria conditionem quae est stimu- lo utero amitterent, cum mulieres non diutius nutrimentum faetui praebere possunt, DE CAUSA FINAL!. Adhuc quidem in dubio est, quibus usibus inserviant menses. Multi putant esse nutrimen- to faetui. Nonnulli, turn veteres, turn recenti- ores, hanc opinionem protulerunt. Quia mens- es desinunt, dum uterus est gravidus, putatur, sanguinem qui erumpere solebat, per mensium fluxum pro nutritione embryonis, deteneri. Per aliquod temporis, postquam mulier con- ceperit faetus in utero fabse aut vespae vix ae- qualis est magnitudine. Hoc tempore igitur minima nutrimenti quantitas satis esset. Quo vadet nunc ista pars sanguinis quse nutri- mento faetus superest ? Si sanguis menstruus huic usui dicatus fueritj principle graviditatis99 nimis abunderet, ad finem vero miiltum deficer- et. Sunt autem multa alia animalia quae mens- es non habent; tamen faetus eorum non orban- tur nutrimento. Cur igitur auciores credide- runt, menses esse nutrimento faetui in humano genere, cum aliter res se habet in aliis animali- bus ? Ratio in promptu est, quia veras mensi- um causas non investigarunt quidam auctores piitaverunt menstruum sanguinem esse foedum et perniciosum. In legibus Leviticis, de hac re, nonnulla sunt praecepta. Hac vero, ut mihi videtur, ad munditias populi istius, quam ad aliquid immundum vel lethale in menstruo san- guine magis spectant. Igitur, ut res mihi apparet, consilium est na- turae in mensibus ciendis, ut certa sint signa uterum esse maturum.

Which of the various subjects, appertaining to Physick, and suitable to my present purpose I should chuse, and that on which I could enter with the greatest prospect of success, I for a considerable time and seriously doubted. But, maturely and calmly weighing all things, I have resolved to offer a few remarks on the Menstru- ous Fluid of the human female. From what causes this sanguineous effusion has its origin; or what is the particular end of the economy of nature in establishing the menstrual operation in the female body, neither Physician nor Phy- siologist, has as yet ventured confidently to as- sert. Among the various faculties and func- tions of animal life there is none more difficult of explication. Many Physiologists, it is true, as. well ancient as modern, have turned their atten- tion to this subject, but in my estimation, if we32 except a few of the present day, they have stop- ped very far short of success ; their labour has been lost. To adduce any thing altogether new on this subject is not my intention ; my object reaches no farther than to advance a few arguments, which may tend to give stability and firmness to the sentiments referred to by Hunter, by Den- man, and by one or two other medical men. In this manner, I flatter myself, I shall be able, in some measure to loosen the attachment of gentlemen from those false and absurd notions, which have so long amused their fancies, and diverted their judgments, and to turn over to eternal oblivion those speculations themselves. As becomes a young man and a learner, I shall endeavour to discriminate between the true and the false of the numerous and various opi- nions which have come down to us ; some from illustrious characters. But I shall not hold it to be a point of conscience never to depart from the path of other Physicans, even the most ce- lebrated. In adopting this language, I know that I shall procure to myself censure, perhaps contumely: but I had rather run the hazard of • all such consequences than silently to permit er- rour to occupy the place of truth. My object is an enquiry into the nature of the menstrual operation ; or rather to awaken the attention of others to the research. But I have no expec-33 tations of acquiring fame by a mere opposition of sentiment. Therefore let gentlemen be spar- ing of censure although I should not accord ex- actly in opinion with those who have preceded me. I am not now wholly to learn that it is be- coming a young man not only in medical, but all other matters, to come forward with a pro- per degree of modesty, and distrust of his own powers ; nevertheless we must never lose from our recollection, the important fact, that some of the most valuable and useful discoveries have been fallen on by young, and even ignorant men. However I shall approach a subject so obscure with no slender caution, and if what I shall say may lead to a discovery of the true cause of the Menstruous fluid, I shall feel sa- tisfied. To deliver a few remarks on the sentiments of those who have turned their attention to the menstrual operation, may not he deemed irrela- tive to our subject: and especially it may be necessary to premise a few observations on the signs and phenomena which precede and accom- pany this eruption. It is highly problematical, whether there be in the vegetable or animal kingdom, any natural operation in which there is so remarkable a re- volution as that to which a young maid is sub- ject at the period of pubescence. Almost the whole body is changed. The universal form of E34 the virgin becomes more soft and winning, the uterus enlarges, the marks of puberty appear^ the bosom evolves, the countenance is more beautiful, the eyes sparkle, the step, the carri- age, the speech; in short all is grace and ele- gance. The time at which the menstruous action takes place is not the same in all. It varies ac- cording to climate, conditions of life, and varn ous other causes. Girls in the warmer regions are pubescent sooner, those in the colder later. The same is also true of the eruption of the menstrual fluid. This change is said to occur with the girls of Asia so early as during the eighth and ninth year; at which time they are women, and become mothers before they shall have completed their tenth year. But in the colder latitudes, this change does not occur un- til much later; nor indeed, except in very few instances, previous to the twentieth year. The periods at which the eruption takes place in different latitudes, do not differ more than the quantities discharged. In the very cold, about three ounces, in the very warm, to the extent of sixteen, are thrown off The quanti- ty bears relation to the latitude. In this climate, yiz. that of Britain, from six to eight ounces of blood are supposed to be the mean quantity discharged.35 The girls of Britain, enjoying good health, for the most part; experience this function a« bout the fourteenth or fifteenth year of their age. At this epoch they are more or less annoyed by unusual languidness, and weariness, a disposi- tion to yawn, pains of the loins, of the stomach, and of the head, giddiness, inclination to vomit, and sometimes absolute vomiting ; tumefaction, and, at times, pain of the breasts, and other si- milarly uncomfortable feelings. Those sensa= tions, in a greater or less degree, continue at intervals, until the fluid begins to pass off from, the womb. But should any impediment oppose its passage through the womb, at this time, it has been observed to flow from the nose, the lungs, the stomach, the fundament, the eyes, the gums, the nipples, the navel, the little fin- ger, and other unusual parts. The red fluid which flows from the womb during these particular periods has been sup- posed by some to be pure blood. But of the correctness of this supposition we very much doubt. For it has been advanced and maintain- ed that it is not coagulable, and that, except in colour, it has none of the sensible properties of pure blood. But of this more presently. This dicharge of red fluid is proper to wo-^ men during a considerable part of life, and is very necessary to the maintenance of health. It occurs monthly, the periods of gestation be-'S6 ing excepted, at which periods it very rarely takes place, but instances have been furnished where this monthly discharge has regularly, in its usual form, occurred during the whole term of gestation. The instances, however, are ve- ry few in number where matters have been so uniform and regular; and, when they do arise, should be viewed as morbid: and perhaps in those rare cases the fluid may more properly be imagined to be furnished by the vessels of the Os Tincee opening into the Vagina than by the uterine vessels belonging to the hollow of the womb. For it is beyound a doubt that, at the time of conception the mouth of the womb is clo- sed by mucous matter. Therefore the fluid, in the customary way in which it passes off, can- not be discharged from the inside of the womb. An effusion in the usual way would necessarily bring a serious incommodity on the child, if in- deed it did not endanger its life. This menstruous fluid, from the period at which it first flows, returns periodically every month, and continues at each return, about from four to six day, does not wholly cease until the forty-fifth or fiftieth year of the woman’s age. There are not wanting examples, although ex- tremely rare, where this menstruous operation occurs under puberty. Dr. Murno the father, makes mention of a little girl, in whom this oper- ation took place even at the tender age of three37 years, and continued regularly thereafter through the ordinary space of time. OF THE EXCITING CAUSES. We meet with various and greatly different opinions in the writings of Physicians on the cau* ses of the menstrual operation. Ijideed Physio- logists have amused themselves with many con- ceits and visionary speculations as well on the causes as on the effects of this operation. Some have traced the causes up to an imaginary in- fluence of the moon, and others have laboured to prove that they resided in the qualities of the bile. But most of the moderns who have treat- ed of this matter have attributed the causes either to a local congestion of blood in the ute- rine vessels or to a general plethorick condition of the whole body, or to an unequal evolution of the different parts of the body, and density of the arteries. At present indeed there are but few who do not consider the menstrual action to de- pend on the one or the other of the causes re- cited. But in our estimation those who view this fluid as a secretion from the uterine vessels under peculiar ovarious influence, approach much nearer the truth. And we will now de- tail a few of the reasons, by which, the advo- cates of this opinion might establish their sen- timents.38 A few words may suffice to set aside the con- jecture of the menstrual operation being attribu- table to lunar influence. If the moon ruled, in this affair, it is presumable that all women would be under the operation at the same moment. This is not the fact. For at every period of a lunation some one or other is under this opera- tion. Therefore this visionary notion of Dr. Meed is to be rejected both as unscientifick and futile. We would ask, on this head, why does not the menstrual action take place before four- teen or fifteen or why does it cease after fifty years, seeing that the female is during the whole of life equally exposed to lunar power ? Here, as it appears to me, we have a striking illustra- tion of the greater disposition to indulge in ab- surd and ridiculous conceits than to engage se- riously in the sober investigation of the real na- ture of things. But other Physiologists, keeping void of one errour, have fallen on its opposite; desirous of avoiding Scylla, they have been wrecked on Charybdis. The opinion advanced by certain gentlemen that the menstruous operation derives its origin from too great a quantity or a peculiar quality of the bile rest upon ground as untena' ble and precarious as the sentiment noticed above. And to say more to demonstrate the in- correctness of those opinions would certainly be a waste of words.39 We will direct our attention to another hypo- thesis touching the subject. The menstrual operations have been conceived to depend on a congestion of blood in the uterine arteries. But the Physicians who have favoured this conjec- ture have not instructed us how it comes to pass that congestion accumulating by slow degrees into a considerable mass should burst forth at given intervals. And it may be received as an incontrovertible fact that every partial plethora, in any part of the body must in a short time be- come general. Therefore we shall speak some what at large on the general fulness held by al- most every physiologist as the unquestionable cause of the menstrual operation. Few indeed antecedent to the time of the eminent Cullen had so investigated this opinion of plethora as to throw any considerable light on the subject. And Cullen, although not deserted by his usual acumen, unsuccessfully essayed this difficult point having found it immersed in greatobscurity. Indeed we are permitted to grant this opinion of Cullen no higher rank than a hypothesis yet we most willingly acknowledge it to be an ex- ceedingly ingenious one. He lays it down as his premise that the uterus is the last part of the body which is evolved, and consequently that the blood sent out from the heart, being resisted by the superiour strength of the arte- ries of the other parts, is determined into the laxer vessels of the womb, and these gradually40 y ielding to the force of the impinging mass ulti- mately give way, and an effusion of blood is the result. This course of things in the course of a month is repeated. Thus he taught. But I am as yet to learn whence this too great abun- dance of blood, in all women in the same climate, and at the same epoch of life is collected and continues to pass off, at every four weeks until . the arteries shall become so firm and dense as altogether to resist its egress. To the sentiments of those who suppose this plenitude of the general body to arise out of a peculiar condition of the ovaries I cannot readi- ly accede; nor can I grant that the body at these periods possesses any preternatural repletion. But Cullen affirms, that the uterine arteries, as to firmness and density, are unequal to the ar- teries, of the other parts of the body ; that they are more lax and feeble: audit is very ob- vious that the augmentation of bulk in every part of the body is entirely owing to the quantity of blood conveyed to it. The womb, as he sup- poses is.of slower growth than the other parts, and, at the period of inequality, there is a deter- mination of blood to this viscus, the arteries of which giving way there is an effiux of blood, which effiux continues to recur at certain inter- vals so long as the weaker or laxer condition of the arteries shall permit or so long as they shall41 be overcome by ihe force of the blood sent from other parts ; when the balance is established the menstrual action ceases. We must now notice the egregious errour of Dr. Cullen in his philosophy on this point. If the other parts of the body, having acquried their tone and firmness, resist the force of the imping- ing blood, and determine it into the more lax and weak vessels of the womb, it could not happen that those parts already possessed of their pro- per figures and tone could acquire additional volume and power after the effusion of this fluid. But the fact is otherwise. For it is notorious that, almost uniformly, the whole body, subse- quent to the eruption of the menstrual fluid, does receive great increase of bulk, and, in most ca- ses, as to form, figure, and tone, does undergo great change. Therefore we cannot, when ma- turely considering these Tacts, assent to the o- pinion of Cullen, that this fluid is ascribable, in its cause, to any succession of evolution of the several parts of the body. We now turn our attention to the opinion of Charlton on this subject. He supposed that the menstruous fluid, in its causes, was attributable to a certain nitro-aerial spirit. His words are : “ howsoever the thing may be, I will not deter- mine, but it appears propable to me that a ni- tro-aerial spirit is the chief furnisher or setter forth in the work; therefore we shall consider it F42 tis highly probable if not au absolute certainty that we have arrived at the true source of the meustriial ardour.” We are not a little surprised to find Charlton, after rejecting the errours and incorrect notions of Hippocrates, of Galen and of others among the ancients, by him so carefully introduced, admitting an opinion so positively absurd. But we are hereby furnished with the most unquestionable documents of the fact with how much greater facility we can successfully en- gage in the overthrow of the errours of others than in the establishment of truth on our own part. It is an easy matter to pick a hole in any man’s coat. Having advanced so far in discussing the sen- timents of others, I shall now proceed, as my powers may enable me, to give my own views of this subject- And as the most learned in investigating that which is doubtful and obscure, when they could not proceed by a direct and known path, have endeavoured by the analogous and that which approaches most to the open and plain. So I, conducted by their example, shall state my opi- nion on this very obscure and difficult subject. It is palpable and obvious that all the secre tions of the human body depend entirely upon the matured condition of the secreting organ,43 and that every organ before it can perform the function proper to it, must arrive at a state ot maturity; and, other things being equal, that in proportion to the maturity of an orgtin will be the perfection of its function. For instance, a mature condition of the liver, of the testicles, and of the breasts, is altogether necessary for the secretion of the bile, of the seminal fluid, and of the milk. Nor can I conjecture any other source of the menstruous fluid, except it is to be viewed as signs by which we are to under- stand that the womb is so prepared and the o- varies are so evolved as to be suited to the af- fairs for which they are destined. The men- strual action always takes place before a woman can conceive. But, in my opinion, is not so much to be considered as the cause, according to professor Simpson, as sign or result of full puberty. We therefore feel at no loss about the reason why the menstruous fluid does not occur sooner in women. Why, we will ask, is not the semi- nal fluid secreted by boys, or milk by girls, at the age of five or six years'^ To this it may be answered that, at this age, neither the testicles nor breasts, the organs concerned in these func- tions have arrived at that degree of perfection necessary to the performance of these offices. But as above remarked, there are certain wri- ters, as well ancient as modern, who hav6 been44 induced to believe that the menstrual opcratioi. is attributable to a partial or general plenitude of the body which in an especial manner prevails at puberty. Although the premises be granted, it will be difficult to understand hov/ it comes to pass, that all girls at a fixed period of life and in the same climate, should have this monthly dis-^ charge. For the truth is that all girls without exception, what life soever they lead or food they use are subject to this operation. And if it should so happen that the menstrual fluid does not pass off at the usual period the efl“orts of na- ture to accomplish such an end will nevertheless come into operation. Whence arises this fulness of body which is so general and uniform, and to which all girls are so obnoxious, of whatever temperament they may be, whether they pass their lives in the city or in the country ; whether they live luxuriously or whether they live on a spare and slender diet ? But if the menstruous flux be not attributable to the influence of the moon, or to the bile, or nitro-aerial spirit, or to a fulness of body, from what causes does it arise ? From what causes proceeds the secretion of semen in the sperma- tick vessels ? Assuredly from the impregna- ting capacity of the testicles. In the same man- ner, also does the menstrual action depend on a condition of the ovaries to be impregnated.Hence this fiux is to be received as a secretion from the uterine arteries acting in obedience to an excitement derived from a matured condition of the ovaries. In his prelections Jno. Bell, .de- livered sentiments of this cast to his pupils. Professor Munro, a physician of the greatest celebrity, when discoursing to his pupils on this subject, asserted that the menstruous action de- pended upon a peculiar condition of the ova- ries. This same illustrious man added that this condition of the ovaries produced in the fe- male body a general plethora. I am perfectly aware that, when I dissent from the opinions of a character so celebrated, I may be charged with arrogance, and perhaps ignorance. But it is not my intention if the thing were possible, to detract from the name of him, whom I most willingly acknowledge to be of the first standing, and, of physicians the most learn- ed and sagacious- Nor is it from a fondness of novelty that I differ from this gentleman, but solely for the sake of enquiring into the real cause of the thing And should I err in this, I entreat all good and honest men, again and a- gain, that they do not censure me but bear in mind, that captivated by the charms of truth, I have gone astray. ith Professor Munro, the very ingenious Piofessor Jas. Gregory agrees, on this head, as titay be seen in his lectures. He also imagined46 that the fuiness of body, on which the mcnslnial action depended, arose from a peculiar condition of the ovaries. But how this plenitude of the body was produced, neither Munro nor Gregory lias demonstrated, and how it can take place I confess myself totally at a loss to conjecture. On giving my own opinion I now enter with diffidence, lor I well know that my powers are far inferior to my undertaking. Yet it becomes us to be careful to avoid too strict a regard for the authority of our teachers, for in my opinion, and of the position I am thoroughly satisfied, both Physicians and Philosophers are often dis- posed to substitute names and authorities for so- lid reasoning, and are solicitous that we should admit their opinions because they are coupled with great names and high authorities. But it is not the province of a learner, without investiga- tion, to pay too much respect to any opinion. For if so, true science would ever have remain- ed rude and uncultivated: of the circulation of the blood ; of the cure of the small pox; of the iymphatick vessels, no knowledge would have been handed down to us. 1 now therefore shall bring forward my senti- ments that I may at least rouse, those of better ge- nius and more enlarged intellect to an investigati- on of the matter. For although some despair and believe a scrutiny into so obscure a subject must ever remain fruitless. I cannot be per- suaded that the period is distant when this mat-47 ter will be developed; and perhaps it will he discovered that the menstrual Iluid does depend on a disposition of the ovaries to be impregna- ted, and is a secretion from the uterine vessels acting in obedience to this ovarioiis influence. Many reasons indeed urge us to the adoption of this opinion. We know that girls are not marriageable until this operation shall have ta- ken place. Even some inferior animals are sub- ject to a similar law. In the former part of this treatise, I remaked, that the menstruous blood was not, like genuine blood, coagulable, and that it possessed no char- acter in common with pure blood but its red co- lour. On this, however, I have never had oc- casion to experiment. I rest upon the experi- ments of others. But even admitting it to be genuine blood it would not follow that a fulness must be present; nor is it clear how the arteries of the womb could regularly separate a given quantity from the general mass. If the ^noxA plethora means a just and proper quantity of blood, such as is necessary to the distention and action of the vessels, and not, as is commonly vinderstood, a morbid condition of the body, it is absurd. Plethora, in the latter and proper sense, indicates only a morbid and relaxed condition of the solids of the body. If we would speak more circumspectly, and, when treating of the quantity of the blood, use the48 word power or excitement^ we might more read- ily come to a mutual understanding. It is sufficiently obvious, that all the arteries must depend entirely on the blood contained in them. This blood serves as a source of excite- ment to them, enabling them to perform their proper offices.'^ A given quantity of blood sti- mulates vessels in the same manner the heat does. And this given quantity alone is neces- sary to stimulate the ovaries to the performance of their function. The ovaries are a source of excitement to the uterine arteries which secrete the menstruous fluid. At the period at which the menstrual action first accours young girls are pubescent; their breast enlarge, the womb is excited, their geni- tals are evolved, and all the attendant phenome- na give assurance of nubile maturity. If at any time, as above hinted any impediment be oppo- sed to its egress from the womb, it flows from the stomach, lungs, eyes, or other parts of the body. But of this matter I shall speak more at large presently. I will now say a word or two on the periodical recurrences of this fluid. To dilate on the opinion of those who ima- o-ine the menstrual action to depend on the influ- o *The author wishes it also to be understood that the blood is the material out of which the secretions, subservient to the ani- mal economy, are made.49 eiice of the moon would be superfluous; and what could be said of partial might also be ur- ged in behalfof general plethora ; for all partial affections of this sort, must of necessity become general. It is therefore my intention to treat of both these opinions at the same time; especially as almost all the attempts of Physicians, some before the days of Cullen, have tended to prove the position of the general fulness of the body being the cause. The opinion of Cullen is ingenious. He af« firms the effusion to be referrible to a given den- sity and tone of the arteries of the general body, which determine the blood in upon the womb, the arteries of the evolved uterus, laxer and wea- ker than those of the body in general, yield and, ultimately giving way, a hemorrhage is the re- sult. In the space of a month another conges- tion is established, and a second effusion takes place, and so on as with other hemorrhages: thus the menstruous flux, in its recurrences, be- comes established by habit i Yet Cullen has not ascertained to us how it is that this flux recurs so precisely at the end of every month in every healthy female body, in the same climate, nor indeed is it proven by him that any hemorrhage does return at fixed periods with undeviating precision. ^ We will admit, for thfe illustration of the thing ‘'tat the qiianiitv of eight ounces is accumulated.50 in the course of four weeks, and passes off. It is presumable that, if sixteen ounces were taken away by art, there would not be a discharge until at least two or two and a half months should have elapsed. If therefore this occasional ef- fusion be deducible from a monthly accumula- tion, a double quantity being artificially removed in the space of a month nearly triple the time must go its round before a second effusion, see- ing that the space of two months will be requir- ed to recover the quantity lost by art, and a part of the third before the congestion could be com- plete and the effusion take place. But blood abstracted in this way and to this amount will neither change the period nor alter the quantity. Professor Simpson, if my recollection be correct, asserts that he knew ten pounds to be removed by the lancet, and yet the menslruous fluid remained the same in quantity and flowed at the customary intervals.* From these facts, it is very clear, in my esti- mation, that the menstrual action cannot depend on plethora. And in addition to what has been said, the circumstance of the young woman from whom Percival Pott by mistake removed the ovaries might be adduced. Antecedent to the operation^ this young woman had had her men- * The author, from much and extensive observation since the above was written, is decidedly of the opinion that the ground occupied is fully tenable, and to the doctrine no respectable fact Can be opposed.btrual operations regularly and at each time co- piously, but after this unhappy affair, her breasts wasted away, and all the piienomena attendant on those periods disappeared and never after- ward returned. Attentively weighing these mat- ters I cannot hesitate to make up my mind in fa- vour of the opinion that this effusion is attribu- table to a peculiar condition of the ovaries ser- ving as a source of excitement to the vessels of the womb, rather than to the doctrine of reple- tion of the body. It now becomes my business to explain how it is that the menstrual action recurs at fixed pe- riods. Yet I confess there will be a difficulty in giving an explanation clear of exceptions. Although I am fully persuaded that an elucida- tion can be furnished, and that I am not much out of the way in my present view. Why do not agreeable vicissitudes of day and night re- turn weekly or monthly instead of once in twen- ty-four hours ? Because by e-<tablished and im- niiitaole laws imposed on man and the inferi- or animals, the excitement necessary to the per- formance of the functions of life is more or less diminished in a short space of time, and rest and sleep are required every twenty-four hours for its restoration. The same reason holds with regard to this operation in women. Kor if it did not recur more than once annually, human plea- sure would be abridged, and if it never occur- ed, woman, according to her present constitu- tion, would be barren, seeing that this operation52 is absolutely necessary to the aptitude for fecuii^ dation. In some of the inferior animals there is something analogous. How is it that the uterine arteries take upon themselves to secrete this peculiar fluid for a few days each month.^ Upon the same condi- tion that those of the female breast secrete milk after each parturition. Some have brought themselves to believe that it is improbable the arteries of the uterine could secrete, in a few days, so much as is perceived to pass off. It will be no longer wonderful after we satisfy our- selves of the immense quantity the dog will fur- nish in a measured space of time during coition. It has been remarked by some writers that the menstruous fluid is not unfrequently discharg- ed from other parts of the body than the uterus.f It is also a fact that the bile, at times, passes off by the urinary bladder. This points out a state rather morbid in the liver, that an un- healthful condition of the womb. The bile is also sometimes arrested in its passage through the duct common to the liver and the gall-blad- der. * By fixed, fundamental laws of the female economy. t This is congruous with the oi^dinary fact, that any set of arteries in the body may perform a vicarious office. They all in turns, assume to themselves the function of ossification. t53 U'c now turn our attention to the circum- stance of tlie total cessation of the menstrual operation about the forvy-fifth or fiftieth year. Those who have favoured the opinion of this action depending on plethora have not been in- attentive to this fact. They supposed that this discharge ceased at this epoch, because the ar- teries of the womb had become so firm as to be competent to afford an adequate resistance to the impulsion of the blood. We can scarcely ])e induced to admit that the uterine arteries oi every woman would at this age be uniformly and equally so firm or so diminished in their capa- city as to present an ins'urmountable barrier to the current of blood. The thing is far from be- ing probable. This cessation is in my estima- tion, deducible from some other source. That is, at this period, the ovaries lose altogether their disposition to fecundity. For nature, wise in her provisions, has by an unchangeable law ordered that the menstruous action should be discontinued, and the ovaries should lose their capacity to be impregnated, which served as an excitement to the womb, at that period when women could no longer afford nutriment to their offspring.54 OJ the end or ultimate purpose oj the Menstruouo Fluid. lo this clay it remains a question, to what purposes this fluid is destined- Many believe that it is intended for the nutriment of the child. There were of the ancients as well as the mo- derns who countenanced this opinion, and for the reason that during gestation the menstruous fluid is discontinued, and was detained, as was imagined, as aliment to the embryon. For some time subsequent to conception the fetus does not exceed, in volume, a bean or a wasp. And during this time can require but a small quantity of nourishment. What now be- comes of the superfluous quantity ? If the men- struous fluid be intended for this purpose, in the earlier stage of gestation it woulcl be too abun- dant ; in the later insufficient.^ Added to this there are animals not provided with this fluid, but yet their young do not want aliment. Why therefore would writers look to this as nourish- ment for the child when it is obvious that the * The whole of the menstruous fluid for nine months, the term'of gestation, would not amount to more than five or at most six pounds; a child, at full time, together with the se- cundine, weighs from eight to ten or twelve, or fifteen, or ev- en twenty pounds. Hence it is irrefutable that the menstruous fluid cannot be intended for fetal organization. Nature could not act upon principles so inadequate, as to have her means thus incommensurate to her ends.55 young of the lower animals have no such re- sources ? we need not be at much trouble to fur- nish the reason they have not looked out and ex- plored the real and true cause of the menstrual operation. Certain authors have believed the menstru- ous flood to be offensive and hurtful. In the Livitical law some commands are to be found on this head. But, as the thing appears to me, more on account of the uncleanliness of that peo- ple, than from a regard to any thing unclean or hurtful in the fluid itself. We therefore must, according to my concep- tions, consider that nature in furnishing the menstruous fluid intends nothing farther than to present to us certain signs of the maturity of the uterine system. From this view we may explain why it is that the discharge ceases du- ring pregnancy ; that is because at this period the ovaries lose their capacity to be impregnat- ed which serves to rouse the arteries. Hence it is that we never, except in a few instances and these cases of disease, find this discharge to continue while the woman is pregnant. Before I come to a final close, I must pre- sent my thanks, grateful and sincere, to my friend and colleague Dr, John Shaaff*, and to others, from whom I have received acts of friendship, for the many favours and civilities enjoyed by their courtesy.o6 Th’ inhabitaiiits oi seas and skies sliall change, And fish on shore, and stags in air shall range The banish’d Parthian dwell on Arab’s lirink, And the blue German shall the Tigris drink : Ere I, forsaking gratitude and truth, Forget their kindness to my rising youth. When the author presented to, and sustain- ed before the University of Glasgow, as his Inaugural Thesis, the foregoing little work, he contemplated adding to it a short account of his views of the office of the Placenta: but finding himself anticipated by the learned professor Jaffrey, who, he understood, had employed his able pen on that subject, he abandoned his in- tentions. Yet it may not, even at the present moment, be out of place to state briefly the o- pinion entertained at that period*, and which he now, after much examination and reflection, believes to be well founded. 'Fhe Placenta has generally been thought to be a mere medium of connexion, or of circula- tion between the mother and child. To this the author has many, and, as he apprehends, serious objections to olfer. But passing by, for the present, all laboured discussion, he will on- Iv state that, to his views, the Placenta holds the rank and performs the office of a secretory organ, a species of Mamma, and that its function is the secretion and separation from the mother’s blood, of the aliment and oxygen necessary and appropriate to the fetal wants and demands. * 1793.I A TREATISE ON THE Autumnal Endemial Epidemlck OF TROPICAL CLIMATES, COMMONLY CALLED THE YELLOW FEVER; CONTAINING ITS ORIGIN, HISTORY, NATURE, AND CURE together WITH A few Reflections on the I . PROXIMATE CAUSE OF DISEASES. BY JOHN B. DAVIDGE, j1. M. M. D. ALTERAM PARTEM AUDI, BALTIMORE : Printed by WILLIAM WARNER, 181.3.IINTRODUCTION. IT is not my intention in the following pages, 10 unfurl the banners of personal opposition. Dr. Rush professes truth to be the object of his inquiries—-truth is the end of my researches. The expanded mind of Dr. Rush, receives more sincere and real pleasure in the perception of one truth, than in all the fulsome incense that could ascend from a thousand flatteries: His great mind, I hope, is closed to the poisonous nutriment of boyish vanity. The object of my labours and studies, for several years past, has been, in a great mea- sure, an inquiry into the nature and etiology of diseases. And although, not unfrequently, I could meet with the opinion, that contagious diseases did often originate in marsh exhalations, yet as this opinion was accompanied by suspi- cious circumstances and wanted the support of probability, I treked it more as the fondness for novelty and innovation, than as the candid result of experience. Nor should I at present attempt to arrest its prevalence, had it not found too able an abettor in the learned and elegant Rush. Writers, of little note, cannot give tone to opin« .'Ons. Falcons do not feed on flies. Great names alone can introduce great errors*6‘0 Who among us would have imagined, tiial the human mind was nothing but a flux of ideas, had not David Hume given currency to this hy- pothesis? Or that thought was a peculiar con- figuration of the combination of material atoms, had not Dr. Priestly introduced it to our ac- quaintance ? But, to come nearer home, who could have supposed that the water-spout, that huge rising of the ocean, was effected by a pow- er of suction resident in the clouds, without the hint of Dr. Franklin.^ * The true and real cause of the water-spout is, a column of electrick fluid descends from the clouds ; this electrick column rarefies the air to a given distance ; the rarefaction of the air causes an unequal pressure on the water; the equal pressure being removed, the water immediately rises, in bulk corres- ponding to the space of the rarefied atmosphere. This column of water ascends in proportion to the levity or thinness of the air, sometimes to an amazing height; and in its ascension ac- quires a whirl occasioned by the circumambient air rushing to a focus to fill up the partial vacuum and restore to itself its former equilibrium. There is a species of water-spout, which, it is said, at times ocqurs on land. This we imagine is produced by a condensa- tion of the aqueous vapours, constituting the cloud, in conse- quence of a sudden loss of electrick fluid and elementary heat., ]K<?arly upon the same principle, it is probable, as hail is form- ed in the'-hotest weather of summer. This phenomenon, to our understanding, is obviously produced by rapid evaporation Occasioned by an almost instantaneous escape of a large quanti- ty of electrick fluid, either from two clouds, tlie one plus and tno other minus, meeting, or from a cloud highly charged pass- ing Within striking distance of some elevated district of land.61 Great names have a species of magick accom- panying them. Mr. John Hunter gave, for a time in London, tone to the doctrine of diges ^ tion. His opinion, that it is the combined action of friction and fermentation, has been success- fully combated by being put in competition with one better founded, Spallanzani, by a series of well managed experiments, has exhausted the subject of all doubt. According to this in- defatigable man, it is nothing more complex than a simple chymical process; such as takes place in the union of sugar and water, where the attraction of combination overcomes the af- finity of aggregation: That which is proper nourishment is taken up, by the lacteals acting as capillary tubes, what remains is thrown oft as excrementitious refuse. Names frequently are more propitious to books than their contents a!re. And many works, of sterling value, too often instruct none but their authors. This comes forth, neither connected with name, nor clothed with title; I leave it to re- commend itself. If it prosper, well; if not, it will only, suffering the mishap which overtook one of David Hume’s best productions, fall dead- born from the press.* * When the above was written the author did not intend to have affixed his name to it, but for particular reasons he chang- ed his determination.The reader will bear in mind that the follow- ing few imperfect pages constitute the first en. ghsh production in which the author’s pen was ever engaged*: that he was not at liberty, to imagine himself employed in merely dressing a brilliant period of polite literature, or polishing a trope in rhetorick, but seriously occupied in disquisitions of a much higher, and a more im» portant nature; and also recollect, that, it was written a few months after the author had taken on himself the discharge of the highly respon- sible duties of his profession. Keeping in sight those points, the Reader, it is hoped, will gene- rously touch with a light hand, and view with a pardoning eye, the many inaccuracies and the juvenility oiP the style. * It was first published in 1798.TREATISE, &c. CHAPTER I. THE origin‘s history^ AJYD KATURE OP THE YELLOW REFER. THE yellow fever, synonimous with la Ma- ladie de siam, or la Fevre matelotte of the French, and vomito prieto of the Spaniards, is the majority or acme, as the intermittent is the infancy, of the remittent bilious fever. It is to the common bilious fever, what the confluent, is to the common mild, small-pox. They are in kind the same, a specifick difference only ex- ists between them. It is conceived in the same matrix, and quickened by the same sun.* It is indigenous to America, and all other warm climates. It is the great outlet, to Americans and Britons, from life to the grave. The rays of the sun, diffused and scattered, are innocent and salutary, but collected and con- densed into a focus are dangerous and hurtful. “ Without the matrix of putrid vegetable matters, there can no more be a bilious or yellow fever generated amongst us, than there can be vegetation without earth, water, or air.’* Hush ^ol. 3, p. 168.64 Thus the concentrated effluvia of marshes are venemous and deadly ; but scattered and diffus- ed, float innocently among us. The generality of the French writers call it la maladie de Siam from a false notion that it Was originally from Siam, a country in the east. This contains as much truth as the opinion that it attacks sailors only: whence they call it la fe- vre matelotte. It is, in all probability, the Cau- cus or Tebris ardens of Hippocrates, of Aretoe- us and of Galen. Trallian and Lommius appear to have seen this fever. Ulloa makes mention of the vomito prieto pre- vailing, in a most horrible and destructive form, in Carthagena, in the year 1729 and 173o^. It made its inroads in Barbadocs in the year 1696f a time long prior to the visit of Dr. Warren to that island. Marsh effluvia appear to be either the decom- position of vegetables or water; but whether in- scrutably combined with something else, or in- sulated, I leave for farther investigation. In the decomposition of either, hydrogene is pro- duced in considerable quantity. Water, in its liquid state, is a compound of hydrogene and oxigene, with an addition of calorick and a little * Voyage to South America, B. 1, C. 5. t Hughs* History.65 common air. Its decomposition is affected by the matter of heat inserting itself between the liquid pherules until their separation is such as to annihilate the attraction of combination be- tween the hydrogene and oxygene. In effecting this decomposition, however, there must be a third agent. Whether then an union, betwixt the oxigene and light, comes to pass, remains to be discovered : this I strongly suspect. The hydrogene being disengaged and insulated, and very much accumulated, or peculiarly combin- ed, with some subtle poison, perhaps becomes the peccant agent. It is worthy of observation that the bilious, or yellow fever does not generally prevail du- ring the heat of the summer. This may be ow- ing to the greatness of the heat dissipating and scattering the hydrogene, or marsh effluvia, so as to enfeeble and render it or those innocent. That a combination between the oxygene and light happens is likely, first from their natural affinity to each other, and secondly from a phce- nomenon observable during ignition. The rays of light falling immediately upon the ignited combustibles, cause the flame to become faint, and ultimately will extinguish every particle of ' the fire. The probability is, that this phcenom- enon is occasioned by the rays of light attract- ing and combining with the oxygene of the at- mosphere, and thereby interrupting the process I66 I which was going forward between the oxygcne and combustible bodies To this there is an accession of additional strength from what takes place in vegetation. A vegetable, kept in the shade, becomes white, and sickly: when it is exposed to the light it revives, and becomes healthy. This I apprehend arises from the light acting as a sth tnuliis, and at the same time attracting from it itsoxygene, with which it is necessarily charg- ed in decompounding water for its nutrition. Vegetables when analyzed yield more or less of hydrogene. Hydrogene is that gas which in its struggle to ascend, meets with the elec- p'ick fluid of the atmosphere and forms whatj in vernacular vulgarism, is called j ack-o-lanthorn —or when it has gained the superior regions and formed the upper strata of the air, comes into contact with the electrick fluid, and effects what is indicated under the appellation of auro- ra borealis or northern lights^. It is also the principal agent in the motion of the aerostatick machines. The yellow fever made its first appearance in the city of Baltimore in the last of August. The common bilious fever prevailed at the Point from June. A lady from Philadelphia, bring- * It is presumable, that, in those meteorous phenomena; phosphorus may be more or less concerned.mg wiih her ihe seeds of the disease, which were brought into action by the fatigue of the journey, was severely attacked with it in Charles- street, she had the genuine black vomiting, which resembled ink and coffee-grounds mixed, for two nights and a day, and miscarried on the sixth night of the disease.—She notwithstand- ing recovered. No person in the family, or neighbourhood had it during the whole season. This, together with the number of cases of violent bilious fever at Fell’s Point, threw the city, generally, into a combustion. The com- mittee of health requested that the physicians would convene in order to give a report of the city; upon the meeting of the physicians, it ap^ peered, from their joint testimony, that the a- bove-mentioned lady was the only person, la- bouring under the fever, in the west end of the city, called the town in contradistinction to the Point. [I shall in what follows make use of the distinction of town and Point.] The com- mittee received a letter from Dr. Coulter, a phy- sician of great respectability at the Point. Dr. Allender, in person, waited on the committee, and gave information of that part of the city. It was requested by the committee of health, that some of the physicians of the town would visit the Point. Pursuantly to this request, doctors Goodwin, Moores, and Davidge politely went, and waited on the sick individually; they were piloted by a gentleman who lives with Dr. Al-68 knder, together with a student of Dr. Coulter^. Their report was; “ that there was nothing more than a violent remittent bilious fever pre vailing.” ^ This perfectly accorded with the sen- timent which dropt from one of those physicians during his report to the mayor ; ‘‘ his reason (he said) why he did not report the case of the lady of Philadelphia, was a full persuasion, that the yellow fever, being of the same origin with a bilious fever, could not be multiplied, by an intercourse of bodies, under any circumstances whatever.” The above report is a strong and prominent feature of their discernment, and indifference to popular prejudices. A little after this period, the disease, rising from the rank of a bilious, to that of the yellow fever, mounted its chariot of death, and spread dismay and mourning wherever it approached. Conveyed by the north, east wind, it diffused itself all along Federal-hill, and west end of the bason. Whichever direc- tion the miasmata (arising from the stagnant wa- ter and marshes about the Point and wharves) controled by the winds, took, the disease close- ly pursued. It evolved, in an horrid and dis- mal manner, its venemoiis characters in the south end of Hanovqr-street, and its vicinity. After a short interval these deadly effluvia pen- etrated into the centre of the city, and many who were not near the Point nor wharves, those exuberant fountains of mischief, were diseased69 / cither in their houses, or in the streets. Not an inconsiderable number of those who were at the launching of the frigate took the disease ; several of whom died of it afterwards up in the town ; but, fortunately for the citizens, no per- son was infected from them. A very consider- able part of the Point fled into the country ; and some from the town removed; a temporary de- sert was effectuated, I scarcely need mention the daily deaths ; the reports of the committee of health are inadmissi- ble of an accession of testimony, to give weight to their authenticity and accuracy. The greatest number, in the town or west end of the city, in any one day, was seven or eight; the list of the deaths at the Point was, for some time, considerable. This fever began to cease about the first of October, and was nearly or quite extinct on the first of November. All endemical epidemicks, as they depend on a peculiar constitution of the air, must of neces- sity cease whenever this condition is destroyecj, whether it be by frosts, or rains. The yellow fever, like all other epidemicks, delights in solitude. An epidemick, whether en- demical or contagious, depends on a general pe- culiarity of the air which general peculiarity * This peculiarity of air is attributable in the one instance to a f^eneral diffusion of vegetable, and, in the other, of animal effluvia.will have a gcueral inliuence within its own do minion, and communicate a general aptitude to all bodies, within this jurisdiction, to receive its action. It chases away all others of less strength, as is justly observed, first by Diemerbrook, se- condly by the Sydenham, thirdly by Pouppe Desportes, and after .-them by Rush; who is perfectly correct, where he says, that no two epidemicks, of unequal force, can prevail at the same time. How is it possible for two general and opposite constitutions of the air to exist at the same time ? with equal propriety we would say that a cord can possess two distinct oscilla- tions at the same instant; or that two particles of matter can occupy the same given space in the same division of lime. But this every tyro should know. Some of the first traces of the yellow fever, in America, are to be found about sixty or se- venty years back, A physician, in conversa- tion, the other day told me that he had met with the yellow fever, in Baltimore ever since he had lived in it, v/hich is fifteen or twenty years. It is violating all obligations of decency and truth to say that it is of recent date. The town of Baltimore, in proportion to its inhabitants, is less subject to this autumnal remittent or yellow fever, than the low situations about the Potow- mack. A gentleman, who for some considerable time was one of the principal directors of the Potowmack business, informed me that one sea- son they lost a considerable number of their71 workmen by the above fever. And that in no instance did it spread by contagion. Every country has diseases proper to its cli- mate and situation. Some diseases are common to every country and climate : Accident and par- ticular circumstances will create sporadick dis- eases, in every country, not peculiar to them respectively. A disease, proper to one country, can, by the medium of intercourse, be carried into another and there propagated. Britain has its scrofula, and typhus ; the vi- cinage of the Alps has its goiter; the East has its plague ; the West-Indies, America and other countries, within or near the tropicks, have their remittent bilious fever, and hepatick affections. It is not the import of this paragraph, that those diseases are exclusively generated in these coun- tries respectively. The reverse is incontroverti- ble. But as those complaints, although they may originate, or be produced, in every coun- try and under every climate, most commonly and generally appear in those countries in the manner above-mentioned, I have taken the liber- ty to style them proper to those individual cli- mates. It is a concurrence of circumstances, and not given latitudes, that is requisite for the production of diseases. * The seeds of the remittent bilious yellow fe- ver are produced in putrid vegetables and stag- nant water, and are quickened by heat and dry-ness. Those who live in the neighbourhood 6f marshes, in warm climates, and during hot and dry autumns generally suffer more or less. The more elevated situations, and those distant from such sources in the West-Indies and America, most generally escape this deathful malady, ex- cept when the atmosphere becomes universally surcharged with the effluvia emanating from those exuberant fountains of mischief and poi- son ; under such occurrences they unavoidably participate of the evil. This is confirmed by the united voices of writers and practitioners. Males, by being more exposed to these efflu- via floating in the air, to the violent rays of the sun, to night-dews, and to the various, sudden, and great vicissitudes of the weather, (these operate differently according to their respective natures) are more ,subject to this, and all ende- mical epidemicks, than females, whose business is naturally within their houses, where the poi- son is blunted and rendered inert by the fires and smoke, and has itself dissipated by striking against buildings. The skirls of most cities are occupied by the poorer class of inhabitants ; their houses are ex- posed to the first and most violent assaults of all endemical epidemicks ; but as those epidemicks invade more the vitals and heart of a city, they are dissipated, enfeebled, and disarmed.73 The remittent bilious yellow fever neither pi- ties helpless infancy, nor reverences the decre- pitude of age ; but its chief delight is to jostle, from the stage of life, the young and vigorous. The many-headed monster, armed with destruc- tion and wo, wantons in the citadel of life : and now, Anthropophagi like, without warning or premonition, implants his merciless dagger; and now under the garb of innocence, gambols in the blushing cheek of health. The yellow fe- ver is as fatal when with the investiture of an in- termittent, as when habited in its regular dress. Having explored its cause and origin, we may trace out its nature. Dr. Rush. “ The fevers generated by putrid cabbage, mentioned by Dr. Rogers, and by putrid flax mentioned by Dr. !^mmerman, ■were both contageous. Dr. Lind ascribes the yellow fever every whefe to marsh or vege- table exhalations; and this fe- ver, we know spreads by con- tagion. Dr. Lind, jun. esta- blishes the contagious nature of the marsh fever which pre- vailed in Bengal in the year 1762. I shall transcribe his words upon this subject. “ Al- though marsh miasmata (says he) first bring on the disease, yet contagion presently spreads it, and' renders it more epide- mick. Thus the Drake India- man continued free from the disorder for two weeks toge- ther, when she had no commu- K The AiUhor, An endemick is a disease, that afflicts several people toge- ther in the same countxy where it reigns, arising from local cir- cumstances, or a peculiar con- dition of the air. It cannot be carried from one country to anothei', by the means of bo- dies and cloths. It affects more or less all within its own peri- phery. It cannot be carried, beyond its own atmosphere, by bodies diseased with it. No disease, arising from marsh effluvia, can be communicated beyond the atmosphere charged with these effluvia. Every dis- ease arising from marsh effluvia, from the gentle intermittent to the furious yellow fever inclu- sive, then is endemick. It does not appear, that any of the cases, in the onpo^uf?74 lucation with the other ships ; whereas as soon as the disorder was brought on board, many were seized with it within a few days in such a manner as to leave no room to entertain the least doubt concerning its pestilential nature.” Dr. Clark mentions a con- tagious malignant fever from marsh miasmata, which prevail- ed at Prince’s Island in the year 1771, and which afterwards infected, the Grenville India- man. The contagious pesti- lential fever in France, so ac- curately described by Reveri- us, was produced by an exha- lation from putrid vegetables, particularly hemp and flax. Even intermittents, the most frequent and most numerous offspring of the marsh exhala- tion, are contagious Of this there are many proofs in prac- tical authors. Blanchi de- scribes an intermittent which was highly contagious at Wol- fenbuttle in the year 1666. Dr. Clark mentions a number of cases in which this mild spe- cies of fever was propagated by contagion. Dr. Cleghorn has established the contagious nature of inter- mittents by many facts. Af- ter mentioning numerous in- stances of their having spread in this way, he says, “ These tertians have as good a right to be called contagious as the mea- sles, small-pox, or any other disease.” &c. Vol. 3, /^. 160. column, communicated them- selves by means of the diseased bodies beyond the circumfer- ence of the atmosphere impreg- nated by the vegetable exhala- tions ; then if they did not, which is pretty obvious, act be- yond the limits of the inquinat* ed atmosphere, the probabilitv is, that the vegetable or marsh effluvia wafted through the air did the mischief, and not the intercourse of bodies. That a ship’s crew was free from a disease this week, is no just argument, if they be infect- ed next, that it must be b) means of one diseased body communicating it to another; the contaminated air may have enlarged its limits—a part cu- lar direction of the wind may have conveyed the bad air to the ship. It happening poste- riorly to a communication with the diseased, is no argument, except at the same time it be proved that this crew was with- out the control of the ill-con- ditioned air. Marsh and vege- table effluvia smite at the dis- tance of miles, this no physici- an doubts. “ These diseases (speaking of intermittents) make their first appearance in February and August particularly ; iho' sometimes they appear sooner or later, according as the air is more or less disposed to pro- duce them, which, of course renders them more or less epi-| demick.” P.51, Dr. Sydenham.75 A question of importance and magnitude her^^ arises and invites our attention ; it may serve to awaken a little our judgments and elucidate the present ^tage of the business. Why is it that the intermittent fever has never clothed it- self in its contagious habiliment in America. It is rather problematical that it has ever done more mischief, or been more common and vio- lent in any other country than in America. Here is a mystery equally dark on all sides ; how are we to decipher the enigma ? “ Intermittentes, Febres, miasmate paludum ortae, paroxysmis pluribus, apyrexia, saltern remissione evidente interposita, cum exacerbatione notabili, et pie- rumque cum horrore redeuntibus, constantes ; paroxysmo quovis die unico tantum.” Dr. Cul- len, Tom. 2, Synop. Dr. Cullen, the luminary of the medical world, has been careful to inform us, that he has ne- ver met with contagious diseases arising from vegetable putrefaction. Sydenham, styled by Dr. Rush, “ the income parable physician,” positively asserts that an intermittent becomes epidemick from the aeV, and not by contagion. Dr. Jackson says that the intermittents and remittents become epide- mick and spread by the marsh miasma being dif-fused through the atmosphere, and not by con tagion (vide Jackson on the diseases of Ameri ca). Dr. Gilchrist mentions in his tracts on sea voyages, that the marsh effluvia being scatter- ed through the air become the source of popu- lar diseases. Tlxat diseases, arising from marsh miasmata, are ?incapable of becoming contagi- ous has been considered, by the generality of 'Physicians, as a fact almost self-evident. And I believe that few will long hesitate to determine between the authority of Sydenham and Cleg- horn. ^ The unscientifick notion of intermittent and 1 eminent bilipus fevers being contagious, is too ridiculous to find access^ even to the easy credu- lity of the unread peasant: but yet it is embrac- ed by philosophick refinement. And what ab- surdity, though ever so enormous, has not, at one time or another, been countenanced by proud, arrogant, fastidious philosophy ? Orga- nized absurdities, have long conspired against the progress of science, and tyranized over the tender claims of more luminous systems. Endemick is the antithesis of contagious. En- demick and contagious establish two opposite categories. Contagion is the emission, from body to bo- dy, by which diseases are communicated. A contagious disease arises originally from human77 effluvia, can be carried, *by means of the infect ed bodies, or cloths, from country to country, from city to city, from town to town ; in fine, from any one place to another: The yellow fe- ver has not its origin from human effluvia, can- not be spread, by means of diseased bodies, or wearing apparel, or bed-cloaths, from country to country, from city to city, from town to town, nor from one place to another—the yellow fe- ver therefore is not contagious. Either an endemick or contagious disease, becoming general, and affecting a whole coun- try, or great extent of territory, claims, in tech- nical language, the appellation of epidemick. It is not whether a disease arises from vegeta- ble or human effluvia, but whether it has a ge- neral or universal action, that constitutes it an epidemick. It is the universality of its action, and not the nature of the source whence it arose, that stamps its character. Hence two classes of epidemicks—the endemial epidemick, and the contagious epidemick. The yellow fever ranges under the- former, the plague under the latter.^ ”* So far as accessible authority will justify a conclusion, the author is the first writer of America, who has publickly advanc- ed the opinion that the Yellow Fever is not a contagious dis- ease. A^d he would feel no inconsiderable degree of pleasure in perceiving many of tfie most impassioned opposers of his sentiment among its warmest admirers, were it not, that these learned gentlemen, with his Treatise in their hands, pretend OTd assert (with liow much justice may be left to the reader), ; at the discovery is the result of their own ohservAtions^78 Dr> Hush. I The Auttior- “ It has been remarked that j When the intercourse ot bo- this fever did not spread in the country, when carried there by persons who were infected, and who afterwards died with it ThisI concieve was occasioned, in part by the contagion being deprived of the aid of miasma- ta from the putrid matter which first produced it in the city, and in part by its being diluted, and thereby being weakened by the pure air of the country. During four times in which it prevailed in Charleston, in no one instance, according to Dr. Lining, was it propagated in any other part of the state *’ Vol- 3, page 157* A little attention to the nature and operation of the small-pox, measles, or jail-fever, when conveyed into the purest atmosphere, will, in some measure, obviate the difficulty which ob- scures the above fact in relation to the yellow fever. It is found upon experiment, that, uni- formly the small-pox, or measles, or jail-fever, requires nothing more than its own presence,and virulence to perpetuate itself. This is clearly apparent from the many melancholy instances of whole families being precipitated to their graves by the unfortunate introduction of ser- vants, purchased from on board ships, infected with the typhus or jail-fever. Out of fifty per- sons, who might visit a patient labouring under the latter stage of the smali-pox or measles, for-* dies, labouring under a fever, cannot support and multiply the said fever, the fever is not contagious ; the yellow fever cannot simply and without the addition of the elHuvia arising from vegetable putrefaction support and multiply itself, the yellow fever therefore is notty-nine, in all probability would be infected. 1 have selected those diseases, as they are com- mon and known to every body. In these diseases, which are essentially and absolutely contagious, no heterogeneous aid is necessary. In the yellow fever the addition of the marsh miasmata seems to be the sine qua non^ in multiplying and propagating the complaint, and the efficient, occasional cause of its rise, in- dependently of any assistance from bodies : and without the help of these miasmata, the bodies can neither generate nor spread the disease j hence it appears that the miasma produces the disease whenever and wherever it may occur, and not the bodies labouring under the complaint. It is not my expectation to turn, upon the ax- is of a syllogism, the whole esculapian world. Prejudice may for a time bar the understand- ings, but time and accident will eventually un- lock the judgments of men. Dr. Rush. “ Let it not be inferred from Uie enumeration of the means of preventing the contagion of this fever, that I admit a con- tagious nature to be one of its characteristick marks. Far from it It is an accidental circumstance produced chiefly by the concurrence of the wea- ther.” And on the same page It is in no instance cpntagi- The Author. A disease which is not es- sentially, and in its own nature contagious, is not, in strict pro- priety, contagious at all. The yellow fever is not essentially, and in its nature contagious—. the yellow fever is therefore not contagious at all. A dis- ease, which is not intrinsically and in its very nature, radical- ly and inherently contagious,•80 naturally repudiates the idea of contagion. Fire, elementa- rily, contains heat; and ligh- is, intrinsically, luminous. If the vegetable efRavia do, and can, of them- selves, produce, perpetuate, and multiply the yellow fever : and if the human effluvia cannot and do not in any instance, of themselves, pro- duce, perpetuate, and multiply thi s fever, upon their fortuitous union ; which can be supposed to effect the mischief ? The utmost precipitancy cannot endanger the decision. The bodies diseased certainly produce an ef- Ruvia, which, by disturbing directly or indirect- ly the bowels, stomach, or sensorium communcj^ may destroy the equipoise of the animal system, ancl thus prove an exciting cause, in like man- ner with drunkenness or night-exposure ; hence the aptitude of those who have to nurse, and wait on the sick in the yellow fever, to be dis- eased. This is not by receiving it by way of contagion: but under those circumstances the equilibrium of the body is destroyed, the (Eco- nomy is thrown into disarr^ay, the vigour is un- nerved, and an advantage is afforded the mias- ma to bring itself, with all its deathful conse- quences, into full operation. The government of a country is called good or bad, according to its nature ; the best govem- * This paragraph, for its interpretation, requires something Mbove the author’s comprehension. aus in some Cases.*’ Vol. 4, page 61* /81 ment becomes hateful and detestable from bad administration ; but the administration is not physically or morally consecutive of the govern- ment. In this instance we are to depose our minister, not change our civil system. Thus if we remove the patient, in the yellow fever, from the inquinated atmosphere, he is no long- er dangerous or hurtful to the attendants. The Christian system, the substratum of hope and felicity, has become hostile to the peace and safety of nations, by its administration, not by its nature, its, essence is peace, and life, and immortality. Many things, in their nature, elude the most vigorous effort of the human intellect, and tanta- lize the grasp of genius itself. They present to us their modes, and qualities, and affections ; these, operated on by the instrumentality of the senses, advertise us of their respective existence. It is from the effects of human, and marsh efflu- via, that we can have any clue to the secret of their nature. Like causes will always produce like effects, provided they operate upon the same order of patients. The human effluvia produce one order ot diseases, the marsh efflu- via another, these orders never unite—they have no connection. Of these identity forms the curve, and those effluvia the asymptotes, ^ey apparently approximate, but they can ne- ^>^er come into contact. The human effluvia can Lnever produce the remittent bilious or yellov/ fever, nor can the marsh effluvia ever give ori gin to the typhus or jail fever. Is it good logick, that a fever can arise from one source to-day, and from anotlier, diametri- cally and physically opposite, to-morrow ? I’his is certainly at variance with common ratiocina- tion, Yet this must come to pass, if the yellow fever, originally, has its origin from vegetable putrefaction, and is afterwards perpetuated by contagion. Some have asserted that heat and cold, though different, produce the same effects. Cold is a relative term—it has no absolute ex- istence—and that which has not an absolute ex- istence cannot possess a positive action. Sir Isaac Newton, who was a man of no hum- ble genius, is of the opinion, that it is incompa- tible with the principle of philosophi2ing, in the explication of any phoenomenon, to adduce more causes than are true, and absolutely necessary for its solution. After the above theoretical observations, we shall direct our attention, a little, to the authori- ty of experience, and minute inquiry, of some of the most respectable writers and practitioners. It is an uncprestionable truth ; a verity of the most publick notoriety, that not one, of the ve- ry great numbers who have left the cities and towns, some of whom have died and some have' 83 recovered, has communicated the yellow t'evet to those who have attended. Not one solitary fact has ever reached me ; and my scepticism is such as to lead me into a persuasion, that there has not existed one unequivocal, well analyzed fact of a patient, going to the country, and there multiplying this fever. It affects the inhabitants of cities, and not of the country, as in Charleston in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748. And in Philadel- phia in the year 1793.” That is, it could not be propagated, by the diseased bodies, in the country- But that it can affect inhabitants of the country and also originate in the country is fully defensible. I know that my opinions here, as in other parts of this essay, are the antipodes of those generally received. But while I have facts, and those of the most stern and inflexible nature, I shall not be over solicitous about re- ceived whims whether popular or professional. On the Potowmack Bottoms, and along the Monokocy, I have seen the most unequivocal cases. It is also, from the very respectable au- thority of Dr Watkins, very common in differ- ent parts of Kentucky. Dr. Watkins was in Baltimore during the prevalence of the fever this autumn, and, with me, waited on the sick. He, after being provided of all necessary requi- ■sites to form an opinion, declared it to be pre- cisely similar to that of Kentucky. He farther84 observed that the fever in that state frequently • was attended by the black vomiting, he. He said that it was considered there as an endemick arising from the marshes, and in no instance contagious. It is true that Dr. Rush mentions an instance of this fever spreading in the country ; but we want graver authority than inaugural theses af- ford* Theses, we all know, generally, are nothing but the echo of the prelections of a pre- ceptor. In the flourishing and growing city of Balti- more, we have had the most stubborn, and irre- fragable proofs, of the yellow fever being inca- pable of supporting itself, in the cases which havepccured about the wharves and Fell’s Point. After those cases were reinpved up into the city, they had their virulence to die with them, those who died; and from those, who recovered, all mischief and supposed contagion evanesced into the empty air, \yhich bore it to the pages of medical writers, not to the bodies of healthy at- tendants, This was the result in 1794 and 1797, The unfortunate case, of the very respecta- ble Dr. E. Johnson, with several cotemporary incidents, afforded a short-lived triumph to those who were wedded to the contagious system ; but when their opinions, armed with all the ad- dress and subtlety of the authors, came in colli- sion, with those of more erect and manly aspect.85 they i'elt their vacillating uncertainty, and ced- ed in candid contest. Which is most consonant with probability, for gentlemen, going to an atmosphere, charged with poison and deadly effluvia, an atmosphere immediately wafted from the Point and concen- trated under a hill, where many had heen forc- ed, by its deathful influence, to pass the bourn of life, and others to perceive death, with its black wings, to hover about them, to take it from those exanimous and dying bodies, or this noxious air ? Taking into view, at the same time, the fact, that none of those gentlemen, several of whom died up in the city, communicated, to any of their families or attendants, the disease. Some even point out the luckless moment, in which the relentless malady seized them. “ At a particular juncture,” says one, “ I perceived something singularly offensive—in three hours after that inauspicious point of time, I became unwell.” Another was taken ill a day or two posteriorly to some ill-omened hour, in which the breath of the patient was breathed directly into his face ; it was then he inhaled, with the pabulum of life, the fermenting leaven of death. Who, after these and suchlike melancholy tales, can hesitate to believe the yellow fever conta- gious ? I would no longer quarrel with the sentiment of contagion, had one of the above occurrences86 taktin piacc, m people, wlio were not, at the time ol the imagiticd infection, in an impure at- mosphere, or had not lately been exposed to air impregnated with the destructive miasmata. I he fact is, those persons were all in this ilb conditioned air. 1 met with two cases, in two young men, who had been at the l^oint at the same time, and were both attacked, on the same day, with all the regular symptoms of the fever, where the miasmata did not come into action until the eighteenth day—they were not, dur- ing the interval, exposed to either sick bodies, <^r vegetable effluvia, having been in a healthy country the whole time. Whatever affects most our senses, we are prone to attribute our evils to: This is excusa- ble in men unaccustomed to thought, but it is an incongruity in the common order of reason- ing, and is at total variance with the notions of men of science. Logomachy is as much at variance with my habits, as any two opposites in nature are incon- sistent with each other. But I do not consider a war of sentiments, fraught with mischief or good, a coiluctation of principles, tending either to support or destroy the commerce of a nation, as the idle jar of words. It is no new act for men to force the most opposite and contending prin- ciples into the most cruel and unnatural union. Tradition, let it militate ever so much with com- 1 *87 mon sense ; and an association of ideas, bearing no affinity nor cognation to each other, press us, too frequently, into most absurd beliefs and ha- bits of thinking. I might here cause to pass in review before the reader’s mind the great Lava- ter’s philosophy of faces, that finished and po- lished physiognomy of folly. And where is a philosopher, bating a few, who does not stuff his works with the infinite divisibility of matter ? who lias dared to dispute the corrollary, of the great Locke, that the human mind is, at first, as a blank sheet of paper, passive to the charac- ters of chance ? and where are the friends of David Hume, who do not, to this day, believe, that, if an ass were placed between two cocks of hay, which impressed equally, he would starve, being unable to make a choice ? But I am straying : it may be well to obey the sug- gestion, that we should tread lightly on the ash- es of the dead ; I bow obedience, and may Da- vid rest in peace, and his errors sleep in eter- nal silence. Now were I to plunge into the vacuum of me- taphysicks, or enter the lists in pneumatology ; I should believe, with the peerless Reid of Glas- gow, that the human mind possessed, inherent- ly, action, vigour and choice; that it operated upon surrounding objects, and was not the pas- sive sport of incidental impression. Whence comes genius, the innate perspicacity of the hu- ^nan intellect; genius, that heavenly offspring,at all times impatient of the trammels of control and indifferent to the habits of education ? not from the impressions of the beauties of Thomp. son, nor the more sublime of Homer. It isin^ born. Did the mountains of Switzerland, give exertion to the mind of a Haller, or the banks of the Potowmack, infuse divinity into a Wash- ington ? that encyclopedia of virtue and great- ness, in whom may be found every ornament of human excellence; into him who first boldly dared, to rend asunder the strong ligaments of prejudice, to control the imperious tide of anci- ent usage; who magnanimously despised the boisterous torrent of vulgar obloquy, and chal- lengedvthe herald of recording time ? This apparent digression is to shew, that no name is above truth, that our care and solicitude should be the investigation and conservation of truth, not the support and protection of names and traditions. , Doctor Rush, “ An aptitude or predispo- sition from season, climate or constitution must concur to ren- der the contagion of this, as well as other malignant fevers, efficiently active to produce disease ; as well might a travel- ler attempt to describe the cli- mate of a new country, from the history of a single season, as a physician to fix the charac- ter af an epidemick from its ap- pearance in one season, or one country.*' Vol.. 4,. page 63. The Author, “ The one (the yellow fever) is evidently caused by marsh effluvia, heat, violent exercise in that heat, thick, hot, moisf atmosphere ; night air and dews, and the abuse of spiritous liquors- The other (the boul lam fever) on the contrary, it caused by contagion alone. This is certainly the most rev markable (iifFvrence ; and con- stitutes an obvious, clear, and indisputable diagnosis." Chis* helm, page 147.89 “ But I never could observe any one instance, where I could say that one person was infected by, or received the fever, (yellow fever) from another person who had it.” Hillary, page 145. Dr. Jackson-calls the yellow fever of Jamai- ca an endeihick, and no where mentions its be- ing contagious; who also is of the opinion that tnost epidemicks spread by means of the marsh effluvia^ and not by contagion. Dr. Moscly styles it (the yellow fever) an en- demial causus, page 391. And ridicules the idea of its being malignant, pestilential, and con- tagious, as asserted by Dr. Warren, page 412. Dr. Warren, as Mosely justly observes, had scarcely any idea of this fever at all, except in its description. Towne calls it febris ardens bi- liosa, but does not add contagiosa, and asserts it to be an endemick of the West-Indies. That it appeared, at Barbadoes, anterior to the time (1725) fixed by Dr. Warren is evident from Dr. Gamble, who well remembered it to be very fatal, in the island, in the year 1691. That Warren’s account of the disease is altoge- ther fabulous is certain : this man, wrapt in hy- pothetical clouds, was carried about by every wind of errour. Pouppe Desportes speaking of the la maladie de Siam, says ; “ la r^gularit^ avec laquelle elle reproduit, semble devoir la fairc-regarder M90 comtne une de ces maladies dont il faut chercher la cause dans la constitution de VaivJ*^ Page 191, Tom. 1. Dr. Cullen supposed this disease to arise from human effluvia and therefore, placing it under the section of contagious diseases, called it ty- phus Icterodes^—but it is certain Dr. Cullen ne- ver saw the disease, and equally certain that he borrowed his idea from Dr. Warren-—Dr. Cul- len is consequently to be left out of the present discuBsion. -As well might you contend, that a skilful gar- dener could make a tree flourish in a soil unna- tural to its growth, as physicians ingraft conta* gion on marsh exhalations. Ill the almost endless chain of cases, wherein the clothes of those who have died, in the West- Indies, from the yellow fever, were brought to America, contagion would be explored in but one instance, even by the indefatigable indus- try of the sagacious Rush. A gentleman’s clothes being returned in a trunk to his friends ; a young gentleman, upon opening the trunk, became immediately unwell, but no other per- son suffered in the least. Those clothes, be- yond a question, were damp, this dampness was by heat converted into effluvia, corresponding in every particulur with marsh miasmata. These effluvia, from the closeness of the U'unk not be-91 iii<y able to escape, remained in their offensive and concentrated state : And, upon the trunk bein^ opened, applied themselves in their full force to the excitable system of the young man. In this manner, from the water in the clothes being changed into effluvia similar to those of marshes, and not from the. clothes acting as the vehicle of the human effluvia, was this gentle® man diseased. Now if the supposed contagion was so very vivacious as to deproduce itself af- ter so long a lapse of time, how is it that the re- cent emanations from a diseased body treated with such great tenderness the attending friends, as not to interfere in the smallest degree with their healths ? The idea of contagion is indirectly injurious to commerce, and directly to society. Under the inftuence of the persuasion, that there is one of the most violent of contagious diseases pre- vailing in several of the sea-ports of America, can we suppose that foreign ports will suffer our vessels to enter ? A long and dangerous quarantine must be performed ; the damages, accruing from such delay, the merchants too sensibly feel to be ignorant of. Even when our papers do not proclaim the melancholy tid- ings ; seeing that such disease has frequently visited our cities, is it not probable that foreign- ers will guaranty their own safety, by prohi- biting the entrance of our vessels ? will they not naturally say ? the Americans have seen theirerror in .rendering publick their diseases^theu silence is a piece of policy^the diseases exist: interest, the mam spring of human action, fon bids their publicity. From slender causes great events come to pas^ Few could have supposed that the inter- est ranee took in the American struggle would ave aid j^e corner stone of her ruin and over- throw ?^The government I speak of. Athens was ruined solely by Pericles giving countenance and support to a despicable tribe of stage-actors. Upon a slender pivot play weighty matters. I .9^^ extraneous interruptions are not the on.

The archives of America will h^yer record such a fact. Do not the grave proclamations, and serious resolves of city-corporations excite our astonish- ment ? What are these proclamations and re- solves for? To prevent, what, from the earliest dawn of lapsing ages, has never, and to the lat- est eve pf expiring titne will never, come to pass.93 Our interest and commerce fall a sacrifice, and are immolated at the shrine of our folly. long as my reminiscence will recover to me a knowledge of the proceedings of therhealth-com- mittee of the city of Baltimore, L shall: admire and esteem their judgment and good, sense. ^ Has the yellow fever ever been imported, from the West-Indies to America ? Report says it hasi; but where are proofs ? smothered in impenetra- ble obscurity; they fiy the presence and con- verse of investigation. Has this fever ever been carried from the West-Indies to Britain ?t * This, with several other passages refer to the circumstan* ces of the time, and cannot be understood but by those who may be possessed of a knowledge of those circumstances. t On this subject Dr. Wilson in his valuable work on febrile diseases, has furnished us with a most important fact. Dr. Lind, remarks he, mentions a fact, for which it is still more difficult to account, that the same fever brought into this coun/ try in several American ships, attacked those only nvho had been, on board the shifts, others remaining uninfected, notwithstand- ing the freest intercourse with the sick on shore." Vol. 1, page IT'S. , It is not a little surprising that a man of understanding and science should be at a loss to account for this fact. If we were to admit the ships to be foul and highly charged with putrid ve- getable effluvia, might we not thereby be provided with a clue to the explanation of this mystery ? The persons who went on board the ships came into contact with the poisonous effluvia which at first produced the disease j those who remained on shore were exposed only to the human effluvia issuing from the sick and the dying- The conclusion here is inevitable ; the disease does not spread hy contagion, but is produced by putrid vegetable matter only.The poor unfortunate subjects of disease, fly- ing from the cities, find the doors and windows of the country barred against them. The chib dren leave their parents to die, and parents their children, their minds being jostled by the sound of contagion, from their proper seats. The lonely hearse solemnly conveys the dead to the dreary repository of the sleeping multitude, where reign silence and death. Having consi- dered the history and nature of the yellow fever, we shall pass on to a consideration of its symp- toms, first premising a few thoughts on the prox- imate cause.CHAPTER IL Proximate cause Analyzed^ THE fabrick of the pathology of diseases^ has for more than two thousand years floated on the varying ocean of incertitude, the sport of winds and tide. When the microscopick eye traverses the hemisphere of medicine, it beholds theories hurled on theories, fancies crushed by fancies, and less errors smothered by those of greater bulk and effrontery. From the auspi- cious days of Hippocrates, we gently glide down the silent tide of time, collecting as we move the shattered wrecks of crazy systems, until we ar* rive at the fluctuating variety of modern hypo- thesesr Hippocrates, wrapt up in the flattering pretensions of his humoral pathology, and ba- lancing between heat and bile, a long time sway* ed the sceptre of the medical world. From an attentive perusal of this author’s works, heat or bile, or plethora or obstruction (for in different passages he speaks of all these) seem to consth tute the proximate cause of fever. His succes- sors soon perceived the futility of this founda* tion, and attempted to fabricate others more pro- bable. Diodes of Carystus, a physician, who flou- rished at an early period, and a man of conside-96 rei[3lc ciiiiiicnccj ssscftcd thzit fever wss not so much a primary disease, as secondary and de- pendent on some more hidden disorder. In or= der to avoid the force of his doctrine, after phy- sicians established the diversity cf symptomatick and idiopathick fevers. Presently after Diodes^ Erasistratus, a physician at the court of Antigo- nus, invited the attention of the world, his prox- imate cause resided in an error loci. Next As^ clepiades, the Bythinian, stepped on the stage and rudely grasped the reins of government; he, adopting the doctrine of atoms, handed to the Greeks by Democritus of Abdera, attempted to account for the difference of types by a dif- ference in the size of the corpuscles, which supposed to be formed by a combination of in- divisible atoms. Here emerges the doctrine of the ob struction of the permeable can als of the bo- dy, and its consequence modern viscidity and lentor, so famous in the schools. Asclepiades was the father and patron of the sect of the Me- thodicks. Themison vibrated between strictum et lax- um, and on those two pillars reared his patholo- gy of diseases, here are the first traces of spasm, afterwards laboured by Hoffman and matured by the great Cullen: this ^hypothesis claimed the ascendency, at Rome, for more than an hun- dred years. At last Galen, the impassioned admirer of Hippocrates, exhumed and reanimate ed the* humoral errors.97 Athenceus ventured to resuscitate the doctrine of the putrescency of the blood (this is to be found in the writings of earlier authors) and pu- trescency has not made a very despicable figure in the world. Avicenna expressly defines fevers to arise from a pretutnatural heat of the heart. The Galenists prevailed until the beginning of the sixteenth century; about which time An- reolus Phillippus Theophrastus, commonly known by the name of Paracelsus, began to make a figure. This man assailed the Galeni- cal party with all the engines of effrontery and resources of unimproved chymistry. Here commences the period of medical romance, so fraught with the struggles between the mecha- nical and chymical modes of reasoning, these eventually neutralized, and ushered in the chyr mico-mechanical philosophy. The furious archeus of Van Helmont, differ- ently modified, is the efforts of nature, so cele- brated by Campanella and Sydenham, and au- tocrateia of Stahl. If we except Mundy, Eorelli and Cole are the only writers previous to the time of Hoffman, who considered the nervdus system as directly affording a seat for the prox- imate cause of fevers : Here in more positive terms is expressed the doctrine of spasmodick stricture. This idea of Hoffman, Cullen has elaborated to its utmost perfection. Who has taken the proximate cause from the heart, and N98 fixed it on the superficies of the body, in an atony and spasm of the capillaries. After the above recital the mind is restless and in eager expectation waits to embrace a knowledge of the true nature and seat of the proximate cause. I shall, leaving the anterior whims to slumber with their authors, they be- ing, by one obliterating stroke of the pen of Dr. Rush, sentenced to perpetual silence, take the liberty of putting the opinion of the celebrated .Philadelphia Professor into the crucible of ana- lytical inquiry. The opinion of Doctor Rush is the latest that I have met with in the writings of physieians. His words are ‘‘ having premised these general propositions, I go on to remark^ that a fever (when not misplaced) consists in a morbid excitement and irregular action in the blood-vessels, more especially in the arteries.’* This irregular action is in other words, a con- vulsion in the sanguiferous, but more obvious-^ ly, in the arterial system*” Page 134, Vol. 4, “ From the facts and analogies which have been mentioned, I have been led to believe that irre- gular action or a convulsion in the blood-vessels, is the proximate cause of fever.” Page 139, Vol. 4, There incontrovertibly is a difference between a fever and the proximate cause of a fever; a fever cannot consist in, or be made up of (these are synonimous) a convulsion in the blood-ves-99 gels, and a convulsion in the blood-vessels be the proximate cause, of a fever. An effect and the cause of that effect cannot be the same. It Igygx* consists in, or is inade up of, an irre- gular action or convulsion of the blood-vessel, what is the proximate cause ? and vice versa. It is illogical to identify cause and effect. The proximate cause, of which writers say <|uae presens tacit, sublata tollit, mutata mutat, after being hunted from one part of the body to another, and metamorphosed from one thing in- to another, at last takes refuge in the ignorance of its friends ; having for its associates Phlogis- ton and the four elements ; and an honourable triumvirate they form, each having enjoyed its apotheosis. In a disease there are three essential causeso The predisposing, or an aptitude of the body to be acted on ; the occasional, which acts, direct- ly or indirectly on the seat of life and action, and the exciting, or that which destroys the equilibrium of the nervous energy, and by this destruction of the eqviipoise of the system gives the occasional cause an opportunity of making an impression. The causation or modus ope- randi which takes place between the occasidnal cause and the living principle is not accessible even to the most vigorous efforts of the human mind.* * Notwithstanding the generous and enlightened suggestions pf th« able and ingenious editor of the New-York Repository,100 °r occasional cause) assails the tranquility of the healthy bo- oflher“*‘^'' ?’ inscrutable, infraction pH p ^ of the animal ceconomy is cans- ed evidencing itself by a chain of symptoms moieor less imequivocal; these constitute the symptqmata of writers, that (the primary disar- ray or infraction, the disease ; here we 4serve a regular and simple concatenation of cause and ettect, and the evidences of such an effect.

The cherishing beams of philosophy have be- gun to dawn, and I hope soon will enable us to proceed with more certain step in the healing art. It is time that we should divorce from our minds the petitio principii, and, like Pyrrho, dis- robe ourselves of credulous facility. This epoch demands self-evident premises or proven data or the ground-work of our inductions. Jurare n verba magistri, is the motto of unthinking he- >etude ; a master’s nod ought not to block up me avenues of research. ^ 1CHAPTER III. DIAGNOSIS, THAT assemblage of symptoms, which ge- nerally are the appendages of any disease, and establish a barrier between it and all others, con- stitute its pathognomonicks or diagnosticks. The general characteristicks, which disjoin the yel- low fever from all others, are the following : In most instances, a prostration of spirits and an inaptitude to motion, a sense of uneasiness and great fatigue ; pain and uneasiness through the limbs, as if from riding. It some times, without any premonition, impugns the guardi- ans of life. It will in one instance assume the dress of the tertian, and in others clothe itself in all the characters of a cold. But let what will be its harbingers, it soon hangs out its own colours, and demands a tribute. The eyes be- come more or less affected by inflammation, ac- companied with an acrimonious or burning epi- phora ; the head feels itself molested by pain and giddiness, and a sense of congestion; the tongue is indifferently white, yellow, blue, red, brown or black ; in the first days of the disease it has an oily feel. A pyrexia attends ; the skin is one while hot and dry, at other times preter-103 naturally cold and clammy. The prjEcordia is much oppressed, attended by a great inclination to vomit. Vomiting not unfrequently, or a cho- lera morbus or a diarrhoea gives notice of the ap- proaching calamity. The stomach in the latter stages of the disease labours under a sensation of having in it something which it cannot digest; this sensation they attribute to whatever they have swallowed : A flatulency and hiccough help to fill up the train of evils. There is pret- ty uniformly a paucity of urine, and what is voided is very high coloured. A black vomit- ing or purging, hemorrhages from every part of the body, especially the stomach, uterus, bowels, nostrils, and the incisions made by the lancet in bleeding; carbuncles and numerous little biles, more or less, act their part in this tragical scene; the black matter and hemorr- hages seldom appear until after the fourth or hfth day ; yet they sometimes occur earlier. The countenance has a peculiarly ferocious look, iriie eyes are with the redness, tinged with a :roceous colour ; this yellowness frequently dif- fuses itself through the whole superficies of the r3ody. There is in some cases, about the fifth or sixth day, a cessation of the fever, and all the violent symptoms, every thing becomes apparently fa- vourable, and the physician will augur auspici- lously; but this is a mournful circumstance ; it the powers of life ceding, and not a relaxation104 of.tHe disease ; especially if yellowness and he- morrages co-exist. There is frequently a me- tastasis to the testicles. In puking, the patient some times throws up nothing but what is taken into the stomach ren- dered a little ropy, at other times a black liquid, resembling a mixture of soot and water, is eject- ed. The blood when abstracted is seldom cover- ed with a huffy coat, but generally is what wc call, a dense, red blood ; it rarely is dissolved. An obmutescence, and deafness are among the la^t marks of an approaching dissolution, they are truly prophetick of death. The sensibility of the surface of the body is exceedingly mor- bid ; and on the least touch communicates unea- siness ; this preternatural excitability I have met with in a surprising degree. Not unusually a considerable degree of deliri- um accompanies this most prominent in the black catalogue of human ills. Perhaps there is no complaint, from the effect of which patients are so long convalescing. Small purple spots very often variegate the arms, breast, and neck ; they are ominous of peril. By the dissection of defunct bodies, we get a view of the dreadful ravages of this relentless malady: We behold the stomach disfigured with sphacelated spots, and characters of inflamma-105 tion. The liver swollen, and exhibiting every mark of phlegmasia: The spleen preternatural- ly flaccid : The gall-bladder turged with black and acrid bile ; the whole of the primes viae, when a natural diarrhoea co-operates, is manifestly af- fected v/ith erysipelatous inflammation, which, by the way, is the species of inflammation that attacks the stomach, and this, probably, is the reason why the blood, when abstracted, is not sizy ; were it of the phlegmonoid species the size on the blood would uniformly appear ; in some cases this species of inflammation does attend, and in those the pleuritick coat, pretty uniformly, proclaims its presence. The erysipelatous spe- cies is generally too rapid in its progress to mor- tiflcation to communicate the buff to the general mass of blood. That the buffy coat is an inse- parable and infallible sign of inflammation when accompanied by fever, and vice versa : See the experience of the most enlightened and assidu- ous practitioners ; also the professors of Edin- burgh; under whose wings, were folly and ig- norance to deluge creation, learning and science w^ould And shelter. The lungs not unfrequently show marks of inflammation. The encephalon is pretty uni- formly implicated in the testimony of the gene- ral destruction occasioned by the yellow fever operating on the animal frame': Its meninges o106 are found inflamed, the cortical and medullary substance is unusually red* This disease attacks sometimes with such vi- olence and severity, as, either from its force or the feebleness of the patients, to supercede, by death, most of the above-mentioned appearan- ces. The black vomiting, hemorrhages, cerebral aifections, yellowness of the eyes and skin, pur- ple spots, and pyrexia being the most conspicu- ous and inseparable diagnosticks of the com- plaint, merit more seriously our particular dis- cussion. The bile, in its natural and healthy state, is as bland and mild as any secretion in the human body, but when the liver is affected by any spe- cifick action, its secretory function, like similar physiological processes, is subject to vitiation ; and that this black matter, discharged indiffer- ently upwards or downwards, is vitiated bile, depending on a morbid action in the secretory organ, is obvious. 1» From the great quantity which is found upon dissection, in the gall-blad- der. 2. From its great acritude.* 3. From its analogy to other disordered secretions: For in- stance that of the kidney in diabetes, of the sto- mach in dispepsy, of a sore when it becomes, * Vide Pouppe Desportes, Hillary, Mosely, Rush, 8cc. U.c.107 rts we generally phrase it, vitiated. Laudable pus is a secretion, so is the acrimony escaping from a vitiated, a cancerous, or a scrofulous ul- cer. the atrabilis of the ancients perfectly ac- cords with the black vomiting of the moderns. Some physicians have persuaded themselves that this black matter is owing to an admixture of blood, and that there is an absolute want of se- cretion in the yellow fever; this opinion, I must believe, has a more intimate affinity with preju- dice, than with reflection. Hemorrhages seldom overtake the patient in the early stage of the disease, except under the form of epistaxis, which is not commonly consi- derable. When they do occur, they are the indubitable evidence of an atony or paralysis of the blood-vessels and this atony in its turn de*» pends on a destroyed vigour of the nervous pow- er ; this destruction of the nervous influence is effectuated by the peccant agency operating di- rectly and immediately on the sensorium com- mune. It is the result of a violent action on the immediate seat of life, and not of the vascular, or arterial system ; the blood-vessels can only be acted on secondarily. If we could timously diminish the quantity of the hostile power, we should infallibly prevent those sanguineous flux- es. Moderate blood-letting, by lessening the volume of the blood, will also contribute consi- iably to that end; hut too profuse bleedings, y J^obbing the system of its soitrces of recovery:o8 from so violent a shock, precipitate the unhap- py sufferer to his grave. That a violent action on, and not a smothered or incontrollable exer- tion of the system, lays the foundation of those hemorrhages, is obvious. 1. As they do not accompany phrenitis or pneumonia where the vascular exertion is much more fierce, active, and oppressed. 2. Blood-letting after the se- cond or third time, exeept in particular habits, when it is pretty copious, so far from relieving the imaginarily oppressed pulse, rather renders it more feeble and yielding. 3. In the most vi- olent attacks, where there exists the greatest degree of indirect debility, the propriety and safety of immoderate phlebotomy are in the i^-i verse ratio of this indirect debility. I speak from my own experience,'and that of Hillary, and Pouppe Desportes who carried the lancet to itsi greatest extremes, and possessed the most am- ple opportunities of seeing its advantages and disadvantages ; not for one season only but for fifteen or twenty years, during which time he practised in the West-Indies ; as also of several of the most respectable physicians in the city of Baltimore. Lastly, hemorrhages are more apt to occur in those who have been copiously, than in those who have been moderately bled ; pro- vided untimely death, superinduced by those large evacuations, does not obviate them. Sc is mortification about the orifices made by the lancet. Pouppe Desportes, speaking of those hemorrhages, and mortifications, remarks109 « Dans plusieurs les saign^es se rouvrent, et le sang, malgr€ le nombre des compresses, pene- tre, cette hemorragie est souvent accompanee d’une gangrene charbonn^e, qui se forme autour de la saign^e, et dont on ne pent, an eter le pro- gi es ” And a little below-—“ Cet accident ar- rive ordinairement a ceux qui ont trop saig- n^s.”* I shall speak more at large on this when I arrive at the therapeutick division of this pub- lication. The Encephalon although subject to inflam- mation and partial infarction, cannot labour un- der general congestion ; that is, the brain-case cannot contain more at one time than another ; except the bones and sutures become firm and ossined, and in cases where the sutures are af- terwards destroyed by diseases. The medulla- ry substance of the brain is incompressible,! and the case itself is unyielding: When a conges- tion of the right side of the head happens, there is a simultaneous, and equivalent diminution of the arese of the vessels of the left. In case of hydrocephalus there is a general invasion of the arese of the cerebral vessels. In some instances the cortical substance is worn away by attrition. If a general congestion of the brain could take place, a partial vacuum' would of consequence be possible; and if a partial vacuum took place, * Vide Tom- I, page 200- t Vide professor Munro’s incontrovertibU experiments.110 the plates which are behind the eye-balls would unavoidably be forced in, and instant death be the result by the weight of the external air: Ihe columns of which, in weight amounts to about forty-pounds on each eye, allowing four- teen pounds to each square inch.* The poste- rior plate that supports the eye is frequently so thin as to be quite diaphanous. The inference is that either an inflammatory or partially con- gested state of the brain must give support to that delirium, vigilance, 8tc. we observe in the yellow fever and many other complaints. This recieves accession of certitude from the circumstances attending the decapitation of an animal; when the head of an animal is severed from its body, all the blood discharged is from the external parts of the head, not one drop es- capes from the internal. This is substantiated by the following experiments. Dissect the ves- sels to their exit from the skull, then secure them firmly by a ligature, this being done, di- vide the case and you will find every vessel re- gularly filled and replete with its contents hav- ing suffered no evacuation. Again, take a glass-globe with two opposite orifices, fill it with water, then put your finger upon one, and turn the other downwards; no water will escape until you remove your finger * Vide Hale*s experiments.Ill from the superior orifice. Nor can the contents of the skull be either decreased or augmented, except the case previously be exposed to vio- lence. The yellow or brown colour of the eyes and skin is owing to an absorption of the bile or brown matter after it is secreted. There is some- times a tempory yellowness of the skin, this may be produced by a peculiar action of the blood-vessels.* The purple spots constitute a pathognomo nick, they are neither the production of an over action of the system, nor a dissolved state of the blood. They are to the yellow fever what the red spots are to the cynanche maligna, or the erup- tions of the skin to the measles ; they are symp- tomatick, and no regular consequence of the general state of the fluids or condition of the solids. Fever is a convulsive action of the arterial system, as mentioned by Dr. Rush, accompa- nied by more or less of a peculiar and indiscrib- able heat and dryness of the skin: The dryness and heat though are not always present ; as iiv the febris ty phodes. This convulsion of the ar- terial system is the result of a more inscrutable and hidden morbidness of the source and seat of life and action, the nervous power. The mus- * Vide Rush.112 cular fibre possesses no vis insita, its sensibility and contractibility are feudatory of the vis ner- via.* The source of life and action must be origi- nally and primarily concerned in all the opera- tions, whether morbid or healthy, of the ani- mal body. The nerves are the “ seat and throne” of all diseases. Whether a fever be the result of a mere me- chanical action, or the provident effort of the vis medicatrix naturae, that power in the body to heal its own maladies, I leave to the more learn- ed to determine. But there is a something about a fever which is more easily recognized than de-' veloped. A peccant entity, acting either mediately as in the form of fracture or wound, produces fever indirectly ; or immediately as in the condition of human or marsh effluvia, he. produces fever directly. In both cases the fever is the conse- quence, and symptomatick: In neither is it strictly idiopathick. It is nothing but a symp- tom of a more primary and essential disturbance of the nervous energy.—This primary and es- sential disturbance is uniformly the disease; whatever succeeds is only indicative of this first disturbance of the quiet and health of the ani- mal system. * Vide Monrb’s nervous system.CHAPTER IV. CURE. WE now atrive at the division of this essay which is the most interesting and merits the most serious and unbiased investigation. And leav- ing the slippery declivity of hypothetical incerti- tude, we introduce our readers to the more un- equivocal and inflexible data of practical experi- ence : where feeble theory is supplanted by more certain practice, where the sick bed triumphs over the reveries uf the eioset. Dr. Rush, in manfully and successfully la- bouring to stem the torrent of error and prepos- terous madness, which had diffused themselves throughout, and wo vent he tissue of general prac- tice ; and in calling the medical mind back to the almost antiquated system of depletion so fortu- nately pursued by Sydenham, Cullen, Monro, Gregory, Botallus, Pouppe Desportes &tc. has attached immortal honour to himself, and, using a gallicism, deserved well of niankind. The doc- tor’s exalted dignity elevated him above the mean wiles of plagiarism. He,, with the candour pro^ per to great minds, frankly acknowledges his ob- ligations to preceding writers. I am, however, considerably persuaded that in his strenuous ex- ertion to crush the growing folly of medical pie- p114 judicC) which took root in the execrable writingc. of Brown of Edinburgh, and Kirkland of Eng- land, he has suffered himself to be hurried with- in the embraces of the opposite extreme. It is beyond contradiction that the experience of some of the most scientifick and best informed physi- cians, will not warrant the extremes of depletion inculcated in his learned works. In the management of the autumnal remittent or yellow fever there are four therapeutick in- tentions. 1. To dimish the violent action of the general system ^nd remove^ as far as possible the inflam- matory disposition of the liver, stomach, &:c. :: 2. To take off the stricture of the superficies of the body. 3. To discharge the acrid bile as quickly as it is excreted. 4. To restore the vigour of the frame as soon as possible after the fever has subsided. The first intention is best accomplished by a judicious and proper use of the lancet, together with a speedy introduction of mercury, either in the form of calomel or ointment, into the system. It will too often happen from an over excitabili- ty of the stomach that the calomel cannot be used . When this occurs the mercurial ointment must be freely applied to the insides of theihighs, legs, and arms ; those parts being the most abundantly, of all the external parts of the body, supplied with the lymphatics. Calomel is the most efficacious and powerful of all medicines in the resolution of t inflamma- tions of whatever kind they may be. But hi those of the liver its salutary effects are pecu- liarly deserving our notice. For this valuable information we are; principally indebted to Dr. .Gilchrist of Scotland and the practitioners of the, [East-Indies. When we enter the room-of a patient in ,this fever our first attention should be to the state of the eyes, the degree of pain in the head, oppres- sion about the praicordia, and the fullness of the pulse. This is seldom or never hard ; indeed the stroke of the artery is more deceitful in this fever, than in any other disease I have ever met with. If the eyes be much inflamed, or labour under a sense of protrusion from the sockets, or .an unweildiness in their motion; or an acrid epip- hora frequently distils from the eyes together ^with the above if the head complains much, the I pulse appear full to the application of the fingers, = and be frequent, we must instantly have recourse to the lancet. Even should the tongue at the same time be blue or brown. The colour of the ton- . gue is not to be in general confided in. It is some- ’ limes blue or brown from the first days of attack. ' So long as the pain of the head, or back continues116 ^ith a very frequent or full puisc the lancet must be resorted to. This however will rare- ly be the case after two or three good bleedings, except in particular habits. Some habits will bear the lancet to the fifth or sixth repetition, es- pecially where the indirect debility of the system is not great and where there is great heat of the surface of the body, and the tongue white. A timous use of the lancet more effectually than any other remedy,. tends to prevent the ra- pid progress of the inflammation of the different viscera. When it has taken place blood-letting promises more liberally than all other remedies. But when bleeding is carried to too great ex- tremes, it exhausts the general system and pros- trates the powers of life in so great a degree, that the animal frame can never renew its func- tions ; it hastens, by robbing the blood-vessels of internal support ^nd nourishment, that atony and palsy of the vascular system which lays the ground-work of those melancholy hemorrhages. When blood-letting is had recourse to, it should be practised within the first three or four days. It may, under particular circumstances, be performed at later periods, but not with such propitious consequences. I have practised it, as late as the tenth and fifteenth day of the dis- ease, in instances where the patient’s strength had not been sapped by evacuations.117 Experience, together with 'the writings of most of the respectable practitioners of the West- Indies, establish the following. Those who were not bled suffered from the neglect of the lancet, '' Those who were bled largely died from the abuse of the lancet. Those who were bled according to the pain of the head, fullness of the pulse, and oppres- sion about the prsecordia, or in other words mo- derately, in a mu(ih greater proportion recover- ed. Bleeding is by no means a new remedy in the yellow fever. , There wers two young gentlemen, who in a visit to the Point contracted the disease : They were both taken ill a few days after their return to the Town. One of them was blooded six or seven times^ and died. The other was bled once only and recovered. The violence of the attacks was apparently equal. A little after, there were two others who took the disease by going to the contaminated atmos- phere ; one of whom was bled six or seven timse within about forty*eight hours, was put into the ' cold bath, had injections of cold water ; he died, amidst the hands of the operators, during the third injection of cold water, The other who was delerious almost from the first onset of the118 compiaiiil, was uoL bled at all, yet alter a severe and dangerous illness recovered. There were two other cases, one oi'wliom lost about as much as would be taken away at lour common bleedings, and recovered. Though no patient could be worse than she was to recover. The other was bled twelve or thirteen times, his arm mortified, and he departed from among the living. Out of six who took the disease at or near Bowley’s wharf, five, some of whom were so much evacuated that their friends threatened to interfere, died. The one, Mr. Waters, who escaped was bled but twice and that moderately. There were some instances of recovery after those profuse evacuations, but they were rela- tively few. Where one, after such immense losses of blood escaped, there were ten who were either not bled at all, or but once or twice, that recovered. Out oi all the blacks, for negroes by no means escaped this complaint, whom I attended from the first attack of the disease, and they were not few in number I lost none. I bled but one, and him only to the amount of six oun- ces. t do not recollect that I met with a single instance of herhorrhage in a black person. Calomel not only is the most effectual medi- cine that can be used in the first stage, but is al- so the only one in which we can have confidence to remove the stricture of the surface of the bo- dy ; especially when assisted by the warm bath,119 either generally or partially applied. I have seen the ephidrosis produced to that extent by a liberal use of calomel, as to require three or four changes of linen in twenty four hours. Calomel not only cures by acting as a diapho- retick and antiphlogistick, but also by establish ing in the system an opposite action to that of the fever. No two general actions can exist at the same time : So that when the mercurial ac- tion takes place the morbid one must, of necessi- ty. cease. The establishment of this mercurial action is confirmed to the practitioner by a free ptyalism. Whenever a free salivation takes place the patient is safe. Perhaps no person ever died after the full establishment of this discharge from the gums. Not that the salivation, strict- ly speaking, is of any service in itself. It is in the yellow fever, as in the lues venerea, the un- avoidable consequence of the general mercurial action of the system, and of no farther service than informing the physician of this general ac- tion. That the local pain is of no advantage is evi- dent from the following. Let the gums become ever so much inflamed, pained, and swollen, if a very free spitting should not succeed, the sick reaps no advantage, but, on the contrary this state of the gums is ominous of approaching death.120 i'o itiviteihe mercury to tiie surface oi the body, the tepid bathshould be used, or in its place the pediluvium, and local applications of flannel, wrung out of hot water, to the regions of the liver, stomach, bic. Those should be. frequently repeated, and continued, at least, half an hour each time. The cold bath has been very strenuously re*^ commended by Jackson. But it does not ap- pear from his writings that he ever used it with success without its being preceded by the warm bath : This together with its ill effects whene- ver it has been introduced into practice in Ame- rica,* render it probable that Jackson attributed to the cold, what belonged to the warm bath. If it has ever been of the slightest utilit)' in cas- es in America, these cases have not as yet found their way to the public. 1 say from the cold bath, in the practice of Dr Jackson, being uni- formly preceded by the warm, and its general failure in America when used alone, I am fully persuaded that it not only is a useless, but a dangerous application in the yellow fever. Emeticks even of the gentlest kind are inad- missible in every stage of the fever.f No pre- paration of antimony, from the tendency in those * Vide Rush. t Some practitioners have given emeticks in the instant of atr tack with supposed advantage.121 articles to excite vomiting, can be used with safe- ty. The justly celebrated James’ powder is here of too precarious operation. All neutral salts are too inert and uncertain. Whether, upon being called to the patient, we bleed, or not ; we must instantly order a mercu- rial purge, which should be repeated every day or every second day, ^o as to produce four or five stools daily, this number he at least ought to have. To assist the operation of the cathar- ticks ; the lower part of the intestines must be opened by means of glysters. A glyster-syringe will with great propriety and utility be kept con- stantly in the patient’s room^ that by the use of ; this the purges when they are too slow may be quickened and invited downwards.. Tor as above mentioned the sick should never have less than : four or five passages a day during the strength of the fever. Catharticks are of all remedies the best and most useful. They are not to be omitt- edeven in cases where the pulse is feeble, and intermitting: If purges'cannot relieve the pa- itient, his chance is truly melancholy. In support of the great necessity of constant [ purging consult Moseley, Hillary, Poupp<£ Des- ; ports, and the learned Rush. I had my patients I to call for the close-chair from three to ten and ififteen times a day. And those who purged most, vwhen not accompanied by puking, recovered soonest. In one case which I was called to, four Qgrains of calomel produced thirty-five stools : af- ter which evacuation the patient began to mend and recovered, A patient, to whom I was cal- led, took a little broth which rendered him much worse than he had been the preceding day. I ordered him thirty grains of jallap and ten of calomel (my usual dose) which operated twelve limes ; and from that instant he began to reco- ver. It was to the repeated use of catharticks, and mercurial diaphoreticks that I trusted the blacks to whom I was called. Of all catharticks, I prefer gamboge and calo* liiei, pr jallap and calomel or senna in powder and calomel. By the timous use of the former of these I prevented the regular course of liris fever, in at least thirty patients, who upon the first appearance of the disease called on me. The fourth and last intention is employed principally in selecting those articles which will the most readily restore the exhausted strength of the patient. From habit and prejudiee, in this stage of the disease, physicians generally fly to well known powers of barhand wine, opi- um and sether, Colombo, and quassia, &c. But although these medicines are in appearance our hope and reliance ; a just pathology and expe- rience will quickly evince the impropriety and hurtful tendency of all tonickand stimulant reme- dies. The snake-root itself is too great a bitter, and must not, except under particular circum-123 stances, be exhibited. Our sole trust and der- lier resource is in a well regulated dietetick plan, with now and then a purge to keep the bowels jpen. Nor must the inexperienced suffer the ^;v’eakness of the patient to frighten them from :he free use of purgatives. The habits & desires of the stomach are chief. !y to be consulted after the fever has subsided. But during the height of the fever, neither flesh lor any thing made of flesh can be allowed. Ve- getables are the only articles of food that the pa- tient can be indulged in while the fever pos- sesses any considerable strength. The patient must never take any beverage stronger than barley-water, lemon-ade, cold wa-^ ter, water with a toast in it, and such like mild potables. Some physicians are too cautious in giving cold water, and lemonade during the use of mercury. But I am satisfied from daily prac- tice that no drink is more innocent and beneficial in a fever, especially the yellow fever,- than le- imonade, and cold water ; nor are we to discon- nnue the citrick acid even during the use of cal- )omel. Chymical affinities might induce us to ’.believe that upon an union of the acid and cal- omel, the latter would, by decompounding the former, and attaching to itself part of oxigen, .convert itself into the oxiginated muriate of mer- cury, or what is vulgarly called corrosive sub- limate. This, however in fact does not happen.1^4 If any acid possessing a greater affinity, to the base of calomel, than the muriatick, be used, the muriatick acid will be precipitated, and 9, new neutral, formed by this more powerAil acid, and the base.of the calomel viz. mercury, will be the consequence. . . . Blisters are, sometimes useful; particularly to the epigastrick region. They quiet the disturbance and excitability of the sto- mach. - They are not unusually applied to the extremities and other parts of the body but per- haps jxiore from custom and fashion than convic- tion of their real use.. Opium may, in the last stages when ther^j^ no fever present, be given in very small quan- tities, thereby to take off for a few hours the great irritability of the stomach. But all opiates must be followed, within six hours after they are given, by catharticks ; other wise their stimulant qualities will far more than counterbalance any advantages the patient may at first receive from them. During the dying state of a patient, I have made use of eether and musk, but my views con- templated the removal of particular symptoms, such as hiccough, twitches of the tendons &c. which very much distressed what few friends there were who had courage enough to come near the departing sufferer; and by no means the cure of the complaint. They serve undey125 such circumstances to smooth the passage to the grave but they cannot deliver from the grasp ot the fell malady. When hemorrhages do overtake the unhappy sufferer, general experience has painfully cori> vinced us of the impossibility of managing them by astringents whether internal or external, ex- cept in those of the uterus where applications of cold vinegar for the most part answer. We are here still to pursue our general plan. All applications to the carbuncles which oft ac- company this fever, are useless. They may do mischief but we can expect but little benefit from them. Nor does opening of them seem to an- swer any good end. It is best to leave them to nature.-;,vrAPPENDIX. DURING the time that the foregoing Tractate was at the press I accidentally met with the answer of the Physicians of Philadelphia, to the request of the governor, the hon. Thomas Mifflin—in relation to the yellow fever, A perfect and har- monious coincidence unites our sentiments, so far as they res- pect the origin and cure. For the satisfaction and benefit of the public, I will insert the letter. Sir, ‘‘IN compliance with your request, the subscri- bers have devoted themselves to the investigation of the origin, progress, and nature of the fever which lately prevailed in our city ; and we have now the honour of communicating to you the result of our enquiries and observations. We conceive the fever which has lately prevailed in our ci- ty, commonly called the yellow fever, to be the bilious remit- ting fever of warm climates, excited to a higher degree of ma- lignity by circumstances to be mentioned hereafter. Our reasons for this opinion are as follows ; 1st. The sameness of their origin, both being the offspring of putrefaction. Of this there are many proofs in the histo- ries of the yellow fever in the West-Indies. Where there are no putrefaction the West-India islands enjoy a perfect exemp- tion from that disease in common with nothem climates. 2d. The yellow fever makes its appearance in these months chiefly in which the bilious fever prevails in our country and is uniformly checked and destroyed by the same causes; viz. heavy rains and frosts.128 3d. The symptoms of the bilious fever are the same in their nature. I'hey tlilfcr only in their degree. It is no objection to this assertion that their is sometimes a deficiency or absence of bile ill the yellow fever. This symptom is the effect only of a torpid state of the liver, produced by the greater force of the disease acting upon that part of the body. By means of depleting remedies this torpor is removed and the disease thereby made to assume its original and simple bilious cha- racter. 4th. The common bilious and yellow fever often run into each other. By depleting remedies the most malignant yel- low fever may be changed into a common bilious fever and by tonic remedies improperly applied, the common bilious fever may be made to assume the symptoms of the malignant vel- low fever. *5th. The common bilious and yellow fevers are alike con- tagious, under certain circumstances of the weather and of predisposition in the body. That the common bilious fever i» contagious we assert, from the observations of some of us, and from the authority of many Physicians who have long com* manded the highest respect in medicine. * This argument, the spirit of which states this and the bi- lious fever to be contagious, appears to be theoffspring of conjec- ture and a biased education. Whatever the exertions and per- spicacity of some individuals of Philadelphia may have explor- ed I cannot determine- But, in my candid opinion, the obser- vations, which deceived them into the persuasion that the bili- ous fever is infectious, are, somewhatdefective. Many physi- cians of eminence have asserted, in their writings, the above fever to be contagious ; but they have neglected to accompa- ny those conjectures with tributary facts to support and give strength to them- There is not, so far as my reading extends, one solitary case of a contagious bilious fever in the records of medicine ; I say not one case wherein contagion has been, or can be proved. And here, reader, my opinion is propugned and countenanced by Cullen, Sydenham and many more of the most learned and experienced of physicians. Bilious fevers spread by what those learned gentlemen in the latter part of the following paragraph129 6th, The yellow and mild bilious fever mutually propo- xate each other. We conceive a belief in the unity ot these two states of fever to be deeply interesting to humanity, inas- much as it may lead patients to an early application for medical aid and physiciiuis to the use of the same remedies for each of them, varying those remedies only according to the force of the disorder. It is no objection to this opinion that, that state of bilious fever called the yellow, fever, is a modern appear- ance in our country. From certain revolutions in the atraos- ohere as yet observed only but not accounted for by Physi- cians, diseases have in all ages and countries alternately risen .and fallen in their force and danger. At present a constitution of the atmosphere prevails in the United States which dispo- ses to a fever ot a highly inflammatory character. It began in the year 1793. Its duration in other countries has been from one to fifty years. It is not peculiar to the common bilious fever ;to have put on mor-e inflammatory symptoms than in former years. There is scarcely a disease which has not been affect- ed in a similar way by the late change in our atmosphere and .;hat does not call for a greater force of depleting remedies hhan were required to cure them before the year 1793, 7th. And lastly. The yellow fever affects the system more? han once, in common with the bilious fever. Of this there • were* 'many mstahces dining the prevalence o our late- cpidc^ mick. The fever which lately prevailed our city appears from the documents which accompany this letter to have been derived jj-omthe following sources: j’.sill “a constitution of the atmosphere which prevails in the' jmted States and disposes to a fever (the bilious or yellow fe- ?irer) of a highly inflammatory character. It is this constitution, "jffectuated by the marsh effluvia or vegetable putrefaction being diffused through the air, which in the first place gives rise to, jid afterwards renders epidemick or general the bilious or yel- cow fever, as those gentlemen in what follows of their reply rvisely allow. Those who wish to be satisfied that this fever is not contagious, will do well to pay particular attention to the .-ases instanced in the above letter. R130 1st. Putrid Exhalations from the gutters, streets, ponds and marshy grounds in the neighbourhood of the city. From some one of these sources we derive a case attended by Dr. Cald- weil on the 9th of June—one attended by Dr. Pascalis on the of July, and by two cases attended by Dr. Kush and Dr. ^ ysick on the 5th and 15th of the same month ; and also most ot those cases of yellow fever, which appeared in the northern parts of the city, and near Kensington bridge, in the months ot August, September and Octobel*. Wo are the more satis- fied ot the truth of this source of the fever from the numerous accounts we hate received of the prevalence of the same fever ^d from the same causes, during the late autumn in Nevr- York and various parts of New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mary- land, Virginia and South Carolina, not only in sea ports but inland towns. The peculiar disposition of these exhalations to produce disease and death was evinced early in the season by the mortality which ptevailed among the cats, and during every part of the seasdn by the mortality which prevailed in many parts of our country among horses. The disease which proved so fatal to the latter animals is known among the far- mers by the name of the yellow water. We conceive it to be a modification of the yellow fever. 2ndly. A second source of our late fever appears to have been derived from the noxious air emitted from the hold of the now Navigation, capt. LinstrOom) which arrived with a heal- thy crew, from Marseilles on the 25th of July, and discharged her cargo at Latimer’s w'harf, after a passage of eighty days* We are led to ascribe the principal part of the disease which prevailed in the south end of the city to this noxious air, and that for the following reasons : 1st. The fever appeared first on board this vessel and in its neighbourhood, affecting a great number of persons nearly at the same time, and 6o remote from each other that it could noi be propagated by Contagion. 2dly. 7’here was in the hold of this vessel a quantity of ve- getable matters, such as prunes, almonds, olives, capers, and several other articles, some of which were in a state of putre- faction.131 A most offensive smell was emitted from tins ves- sel after she had discharged her cargo, which was by persons several hundred feet from the wharf where she was moored. 4thlv A similar fever has been produced from similar cau- ses, In’^a variety of Instances : we shall briefly mention a few of them. At Tortola a fever was produced in the month of June, in the vear 1797, on board the ship Britannia, capt. James Welch, from the noxious air generated from a few bushels o potatoes, which destroyed the captain, mate, and most of the crew, in a few days. Two sailors were affected with a malignant fever, board ^he , capt. Thomas Egger, in the month of^March, 1727, from the noxious air produced by wine that had putri - ed in the hold of the ship, one of whom died soon after her arrival in Philadelphia. In the month of June, 1793, the yellow fever was genera- ted by the noxious air of some rotten bags of pepper on board a French Indiaman, which was carried into the port ot Bridgetown, by the British letter of iparque Pilgrim. All the white men and most of the negroes employed in removing this pepper, perished with the yellow fever and the foul atmosphere affected the town, where it proved fatal to many of the inha- bitants. On board the Busbridge Indiaman a yellow fever was pro- duced in the month of May, 1792, on her passage from England to Madras, which affected above two hundred of the crew, it was supposed to be derived from infection, but many qircum- stances concur to make it probable that it was derived from noxious air. The absence of smell in the air does not militate against this opinion, for there are many proofs of the most malignant fevers being brought on by airs which produced no impression on the sense of smelling. This is more frequent y the case when the impure air has passed a considerable distance from its source and becomes diluted with the purer air of t c atmosphere.132 fever and infection'oahe^velbi^fev^"'^ *”* “P°” der cfecunratances vvkth'Xl ^ 'Ws source ol TenCet «he dise-asesTCntcUmaT:;' trid effluvia oh ship’s mentions “ the pu- s“?r^so ‘ t'’'Ibe ?e°aIonfJhI stance ^o^ttf tt'"'''"'- ously ascribed solely to importation in "’°"S ‘b= shore of the Delaware w\Zr'^Twis^7'''' Wm. fp/ I- 1 u 1 ' generated by the putrefaction of cof- fee which had remaind there during her voyaire from Vhul delplua to Hamburgh, and back apm '^°>“8efrom Phtla- * In the course of our enquires #e were led to ensnerf on» source of our late fever to be of foreign origin.

In thus deciding upon the nature and origin of our late fever we expect to administer consolation to our fellow citizens up- on the cause of our late calamity, for in pointing out its origin to the senses, we are enabled immediately and certainly to pre- vent it. But while the only source of it is believed to be from i abroad and while its entrance into our city is believed to be in ways^ so numerous and insidious as to elude the utmost possi- ble vigilance of health officers,, we are led in despair to consi- der the disease as removed beyond the prevention of human power or wisdom. It has been by adopting measures similar to those we have delivered for preventing pestilential diseases, tnat most of the cities of Europe, which are situated in warm latitudes, have become healthy in warm seasons and amidst the closest commercial intercouse with nations and islands .const^tly afflicted with those diseases. The extraordinary cleanliness of the Hollanders, was originally imposed upon pestilential fevers in their cities. Ihis habit of cleanliness has continued to characterize those fieople after the causes which produced it have probably ceas- ed to be known. In thus urging a regard to the domestick sources of the yel- eow fever, we are actuated by motives of magnitude, far beyond f hose which determine ordinary questions in science. Though s veteel the strongest conviction that the value of property, the ncrease of commerce and general prosperity of our city, will *e eminently forwarded by the adoption of the foregoing propo- itions, yet these are but little objects in our view when com- .ared with the prevention of the immense mass of distress |/mch never tails to accompany a mortal epidemick.

J137 From Dr. Damclge to Dr. Barton. Dear Sir, I AM entering on a compartment to which I am no stranger. Its topography is familiar to me : I have traversed its fields ; passed through its walks ; and explored its most intimate recess- es, with great industry, care, and minute obser- vation. At least every day of my life, I am en- gaged in the contemplation of the objects of this divison, and ought, in some measure, to be ac- quainted with them. To be qualified to judge accurately, and well, of what is without the scheme of nature, we should be well acquainted with what is within her plan. A partial view of her operations will lead us into error, and inconclusive deduction. When I cast my eyes over the vast scenes of na- ture, I with much delight observe her plan ; I see animals, vegetables, and minerals : animals and vegetables living, and reproducing; mine- rals growing, each after its own kind. When I look into the body of a human female, I behold organs of higher and lower importance the lungs to oxidate the blood, and the stomach to digest the food, the kidneys to secrete the urine, the uterus to bear the young 8tc. The S138 uterus and the ovaria, with their appendages, are, equally with the stomach and lungs, provided by nature. They are not morbid productions. Each organ by nature is destined to certain func*- tions, or offices. Am I deceived in this ? Can the oval ia and uterus be organs of nature, and yet conception and gestation be “ grades of dis- ease ?” Can any human mind, in its calmer mo- ments, when relieved from the importunate en- treaties of a new-bom theory, conceive any thing so incongruous, as that the ovaria and uterus are organs of nature, and yet conception and ges- tation are gradations of disease ? Let us exa- mine into this opinion. In every perfect female body, we find organs of generation, as well as organs of digestion and respiration. Our venereal appetencies are as regular as qur appetites for aliments of life, or our demands for the renewal of the oxigenous stimulus to our blood ; and it is as natural to gratify the one as the other. If we cease to gra- tify our appetites for food, or demands for res- piration, we die ; if we cease to indulge our ap-' petites for venery, our kind becomes extinct. The former are death to the body ; the latter is deaUi to the race. Now, seeing that the organs of generation, with their appetencies, are strictly conformable to the original intentions of nature, with what modesty or apology do we say, that the resultt 1.39 of these appetencies, and the functions to which the organs are destined, are gradations of disease? Can an organ with its instinct be natural, andne» vertheless the only function of which it is capa» ble be morbid, or a gradation of disease ? When- ever a function is performed agreeably to the fun- damental and immutable laws of nature, and without which intermediate function the grand scheme of nature becomes broken and discon- tinuous, we intelligibly and with understanding argue such function to be natural, or within the • plan of nature. Of the grand though inscruta- ble catenation of human reproduction, that preg- nancy is a distinguished link, no man in the pos- session of a sound mind can entertain the most extenuated doubt. If,, then, a link connecting and alone appending the subsequent to the pre- cedent generation, how can it be said to be a dis- ease ? A disease is a mere coniingency j a con- tingency declarative of an aberration from the healthy economy of the animal body. Disease Is an accident to which nature is liable, but no part of her economy can it constitute. But con- . ception and gestation are the very work of the ma- turity and health of the animal body. Were pregnancy a disease, or, as gentlemen please to phrase it, b. grade of disease, then were pregnancy, in its inception, progression, and ter- mination, truly fortuitous and incidental. The sublime order of the universe would be forced from its connection, its great design be marred,140 ruined, and a second chaos involve its beauties. Pregnancy is within the control of uniform, de- terminate laws, consecutively subject to the com- mon government of the economy of the body. The uniformity and regularity of utero-gestation are inferrible from the fixedness and constancy of its term. That pregnancy is laid out and planned, in the deep, unsearchable projection of nature, is deducible from the accordance of the marriage state, bearing children, with the most perfect health. Not unfrequently, indeed, the stimu- lus of matrimony bears the body above diseases, not otherwise manageable by our art. That wo- men, while pregnant, should be favoured with a total exemption from disease, is not at all con- sequential of the position, that gestationis a con- dition of nature. Nature may as readily be en- cumbered by disease, its various ramifications entwining about her springs, in one part of her motions as another. Dyspepsia at times invades' the stomach, but still digestion is a natural func- tion ; tubercles may be diffused through the lungs, interrupting their play, nevertheless res- piration is a healthy animal operation. Gan apart of the economy of nature be so ame- liorated, by medical aid, as to be better suited, in its relations and operations, to the purposes of its office, than it is by its original constitution ? I answer in the negative. Then why shall we.141 break in upon nature’s works with our agency ? Gentlemen not only upturn the foundations of the physical world, but they dream of suspend- ing the very denunciations of Heaven on the point of their lancet. During gestation, nature may, in her econo- my, be encumbered by disease ; and the plan of her procedure be disturbed. But, as the cause 3f this disturbance is not uniform in its specifick relations, neither can the means appealed to be without variety in their kind. To the particu- lar character of the disease, with which the preg- nant female may be oppressed, the remedies, n extent and nature, must be accommodated. If .he powers of life fall low, and she is unnerved 3y languor, arising from luxury or poverty of iiet, let her be advised to suitable nutriment, cordial beverage, exhilarating company, and re- gular exercise. If the stomach be distressed by dyspepsia, she is directed to magnesia, alkalies, “meticks, tonicks, or lime-water; to which we add ixercise, the first and best mode of infusing vi- gour into the system, with all its organs. ' If the nowels be slow, aperients are pressed into ser- vice. If the body be raised in its action by too ligh stimulation, general or local, the circula- ion is to be tamed, the system tranquillized, the igid fibre relaxed, by the abstraction of blood ; which abstraction, in degree, will be according CO the accidents of each individual case, the gen- eral hurry, or local impediment. All general142 rule is inadmissible ; there can be no uniformi- ty of usage, in things of themselves contingent. As I advance, I find that I have some matters of etiquette in science to adjust with an ingenious gentleman of Wilmington, Dr. Vaughan, and also with a learned lecturer of Philadelphia. While I use towards these gentlemen every per- sonal civility and courtesy, I must be permitted to indulge in liberal criticism on their sentiments. Error in youth is excusable, but in teachers should be chastised. I proceed, in the first place, to notice, in de- tail, some propositions from the pen of Dr. Vaughan, a gentleman of much character and ingenuity, and who, by writing, has become a teacher in the art of Midwifery. This gentle- man lays it dov/n, as a part of his ground-work, that “ several pounds of blood are retained with the mother, and transformed into foetal organi- zation, and that this fluid is the menses, reserv- ed during ten lunar months.” Dr. Vaughan promised, that, “ after giving Mr. White’s opinion, with its authorities, in his own language, he would reply to them in detaih ed order.” He then subjoins : It is immate^ rial to the present question, whether the cata- menia be occasioned by general plethora or not; if a given quantity of the sanguiferous fluid, or- dinarily discharged by essential laws” (surely14S not a morbid hemorrhage dependent on essen- tial laws), “ and retained in the pregnant state, the consequences are the same.” But if this given quantity be unequal to the sum of the child's weight, the consequences will be' very dissimilar: and that it is unequal to it, we infer from the respectable testimony of Dr. Vaughan himself. In his foot-note, he says, that “ the weight of the full-grown foetus, and its appendages, so far exceeds the ordinary sum of the catamenia in ten lunar months, that other excretions must be lessened in a considerable degree.” Rep. v. 6, p, 152. This foot-note gives to me all I contend for; it maintains, in the face of all opposition, that .there cannot possibly be “ a retention or accu- mulation,” in either the general or uterine sys- (tem, during the latter months of pregnancy. And -specially if there is this contribution laid on other excretions, what occasion can there be for he use of the lancet ? T he Doctor then refers us in a summary way, ro the opinions of Dr. Rush : opinions always .espectable, and entitled to the highest defer- ence from the medical world. But opinions and iietailed arguments are not the same, in my view. At this moment my pen is arrested by the Tfielancholy tidings, that my able and worthy144 correspondent has paid the great debt of morta- lity. In his mind burned the lamp of science , from his heart rose the incense of piety ; and through his actions flowed the warm stream of benevolence. But, alas ! nature has her de- mands, and in a tone and style too forcible and intelligible to be misunderstood, speaks to her son : “ dust thou art, and unto dust shaft thou return.” The menses are, with me, a natural secretion from the arteries of the womb under ovarious influence. They are the first to premonish even the tender virgin herself of nubile maturity. They inspire their lovely authoress with new desires, admonish her to new hopes, and throw about her air all the ornament and force of irre- sistible captivation, attraction, and grace. When this conceptions female, from sexual intercourse with her manly companion, becomes pregnant, the uterine arteries cease their func- tions ; a new, though temporary, organ begins its office. The placenta, endowed with the function of a gland, provides nutriment for the foetus. There are solitary cases, in which a spe-| cies of morbid hemorrhage, or vicarious mens-i es, continues throughout pregnancy. Is this ef-^ flux of blcod from the vessels of the os tineas ? But to return, and fairly examine into the^ merits of the proposition, giving it the fulle^l145 possible bearing on the subject. I will, for the ’.moment, concede the point before us. Let the menses be formed, and be retained, according io the pleasure of the writer. The total sum of duid, amassed during nine calender, or even ten hinav months, would not be, upon the most li- □eral estimate for fcetal organization, more than :.ive pounds of aliment, allowing six ounces to 2ach menstruous period. An ordinary child weighs from ten to fifteen pounds : that is, from five to ten pounds more than the total sum of the fluid retained. How far does this go to demonstrate, that fce« ml organization derives its sources from the men- istruous fluid? And here I might, not inaptly, subjoin a second problem: If the human foetus ^e made up of the menstruous fluid, whence are .he materials for the organization of the young of the lower animals furnished? They have no rmenses. The Doctor’s proposition extends muqh far- ther. It not only insinuates, but directly main- tains, that this fluid is retained, and yet is trans- iibrmed into fcetal organization ! What! is the menstrual fluid retained with the mother, con- • uituting a source on which we may advantage- ously draw with the lancet, and moreover is tiransformed into foetal organization ? This is a ispecies of logick, to my understanding, neither 'ibrcible nor clear. T146 1 he doctrine is wholly wrong, both in its prcj niises and conclusion 5 and, of all hypothese within the reach of a sprightly fancy, the moa unhappy in its deductions for the general rul! of blood-letting, with which it was proposed tJ quadrate. Still further to illustrate his favourite doctrini of blood-letting during utero-gestation, this genj tlemen refers us to the concentration of excitej inent in the gravid uterus, and the extra-vitalitj of impregnation ; to the tenacity of pregnant fei males for life, and the surviving existence o; the foetus in utero, after the death of the mother I am not prepared to determine, whether an im- pregnated female is more vivacious than an un- impregnated one. There are not sufficient do. cuments before the public, for us to enter on this disquisition. That a foetus in utero sur. vives five minutes, or even two, the death oi the mother, is what the facts hitherto furnished by faithful obstetrick record directly oppose^ The child ceases to live, immediately after itj ceases to receive, through the mediation of the) placenta, oxigen from the mother’s blood. The! chick may have its blood oxidated through the! shell with which it is encased, but the human foetus cannot have this necessary supply through the walls of the abdomen. Obstetrick history expands to our view many instances of judicious, well-managed efforts147 ve the child on the death of the mother ; but eir ill success has devolved the iteration of . ese elForts on those who can believe, that the itus can live without the constant renovation * the oxigenous stimulus. We have no materials of which the theory of : e continuity of circulation, between the moth- and child, can be constructed. Injections, inner than red-blood, have not, as yet, found ;.eir way from one to the other. And, were le circulation continuous, and immediate, a feless mother could not support a living child, 'he alimental supply before birth, as before ob- Tved, is by means of the placenta, acting as k gland, as it is subsequently furnished by the ammse. Dr. Dewees, in his thesis, the mirror from ; hich all the features of his doctrine are reflect- ;i to us, adopts the hypothesis, “ that they )Dregnancy and parturition) ought to be consi- r^red as diseases, according to the opinion of I'r. Rush, one of the greatest ornaments of me- liicine, in the present or any antecedent age. ihis he infers from the necessity, in too many iistances, a few cases only excepted, of our be- ig obliged to mitigate their violence, or shorten iieir duration*.” * « Pregnancy,” “ Though a alteration of the animal conomy, which every female seems originally formed to under- o, and hence nqt to be considered as a state of disease^" 8cc. Encyclofmdieir148 To this I can afRx no definite, determinate idea, « Shorten their duration !” And are we obliged, in the general, to shorten the duration of pregnancy ? The Doctor cannot possibly be serious in this ; yet he says, that, we are obliged it is not a point of choice, “ to mith gate their violence, and shorten their duration,” viz., the duration oj pregnancy and parturition. Then pregnancy has no fixed, legitimate term ! It is as salutary and regular at six, as at nine months ! Would the extraction of a given quan- tity of the blood of the chesnut-tree improve the maturation of its nut, or aid the evolution of the burr ? A rose, whether cultivated in America, or transplanted to the soil of Russia, howsoever altered in its foliage, its efflorescence, or the tints of its petals, continues to be one of the chief natural ornaments of the parterre. Preg- nancy remains, amidst all the mutations of cli- ’ mate, and cultivation of civilization, a natural ^ condition ; an indefeasible right of nature. ! “ The uterus is a hollow viscus, in which the | great object of conception is performed.” To ’ my understanding, this sentence is extremely obscure; it is wholly unintelligible. “ The ute- rus is a hollow viscus, in which the great object of conception is performed.” The author cer- i taijily does not wish to convey the idea, that the uterus is the organ of conception ; and yet to me,149 the sentence is unsusceptible of any other inter- pretation. It leaves no room for his brilliant dis- covery of the passage of the second ovum, incase of superfcetation, along the fallopian tube ; its se- oaration of the membrana decidua from the pari- otes of the uterus, and getting within this hollow viscus. Of all the discoveries in the mystery of generation, this is by far the most splendid '« An embryon, with its water and involucra, the whole not equiponderant with two grains, forci- oly breaking up the attachment of the membra- :ia decidua, and making for itself room in the cavity of the uterus ! Does this embryon force ts way by mechanical powers, or melt down the )and of attachment between the lining membrane ind wall of the uterus, by certain chemical pro- perties ? The sentence in itself is a handsome display i)f the ability Avith which some gentlemen are fa- voured, of making a pretty arrangement of words, * “ This resistence will, however, be soon overcome ; either )y the ordinary efforts of the tube, or by the ovum resting un- i'lsually long, and beginning to develope, obliging the mouth of ihe tube to open,” &c. Museutriy V. 1, No. 2, p. 172. What efforts are these, that can overcome the resistence of- fered by the attachment of the lining membrane of the gravid iterus ? The more the ovum developes, the less the probability rf a passage through the mouth of the tube. The ovum, under these circumstances, must remain in the tube, and constitute an extra-uterine foetus. Perhaps the ovum would travel into the : Iterus, as Dr. Harrison’s semen would travel out of it. See Museum’) V. I, No. I, p« 39.L50 without infusing into them the power of making a definite impression on the reader’s mind. But again to the thesis. “ However easy the act of child-bearing be, among savage tribes, and certain individuals in various states of soci- ety, we find it, among others, an operation of great pain, and frequent danger.” Here is an assumption of principles, upon the begged question ; a gratuitous assumption of the very points at issue. The sentence, with the following parts of the paragraph, of which it is a member, embraces as acknowledged facts, two points: the one, that the parturient act with the savage is uniformly easy, without pain or difficulty ; the other, that, with the civilized woman, civilization and refinement have produc- ed difficulty, pain and danger. Neither of these positions are true. The first rests upon the insufficient grounds furnished by the reports, vague and highly ques- tionable, of travellers. Travellers are privileg- ed men; in an especial manner so, when they undertake to write and speak of things, to which they could not possibly have access. Whate- ver is uncommon, or without the usual course of things, is, by a savage, uncultivated people, in a high degree deserving of notice ; is among the first objects of communication to a stranger. The reports, in themselves, convey to me the151 fullest satisfaction that they are not the facts of observation ; that they are mere unusual, ex- traordinary matters, which, from their infrequen- cy and being out of the usual course of things, ■become the marvellous points of communication. IBut even the authors of these wonderful tales tdo not tell us, that the labour with the savage iis without pain. From these persons we collect tthe information, that, among this unsettled sort :of people, there are no persons, male or female, cdevoting themselves to the obstetrick art. If this "be correct, whence is.their information ? Have :they made it a matter of private enquiry with the individual Squaws ? Are there no instances of preternatural pre- sentation among the Calabrian societies ; such .as that of the arm, back, or belly ? Would these ttoo be without pain or difficulty These tales :^f uncivilized life are told to us in a most unci- wi\ manner. They are an indecorous attack on t he understanding of every man. The savage, the negro, and the poorer sort peasantry, are in their condition nearly simi- iar. They present not dissimilar phenomena to Hhe eye of observation. And with them there is naturally, and originally, in relation to the com- rmenccment of labour, an equal degree of diffi- ;:ulty, pain, and danger Nature, in the gene- *ral, is upon the same scale, and is safe ; I speak of the negro, the peasant, and the savage. Mis-152 chief is the result of rude and clumsy art, in the hands of adventurous ignorance. i In fine, we have no authorities upon which wei can, with safety, proceed in our investigations! into the state of parturition, amidst savage life.) And what are we to think of the narratives ofl men, totally without the means of instruction,| in respect to the affairs of the woman of the fo--, rest, when a lecturer can publish to the world,) ‘‘ that the labours of the brute are not generallyl attended with pain, or difficulty.” Have any of these intelligent travellers been at the couch of] the lion, or the lair of the wild-hog, the den of, the wolf, or the hole of the fox ? The female horse may die with her foal in her matrix *, there) are birds of prey and quadrupeds, fierce and' carnivorous: who is to save from the talons of the one, and the jaws of the other, the objects, of our research ? In speaking of the brute, thei Doctor cannot certainly allude to such as browsej our meadows, bound along our plains, or to the: trusty animal that faithfully guards the shep-j herd’s flock. Such news, bearing the stamp ofj authenticity, would be joyous tidings to the far-j mer. ! The Abbot Raynal wrote a book, the object j of which was to prove to the credulous world, the deterioration of all animals, even man, in this western world. From whom did the Abbot get his information? From travellers. From153 whom do learned gentlemen get their informa- tion? From travellers. From the most correct view I can get of the subject, I am inclined to believe, that natural labours (all labours are natural in themselves, and only unnatural in their circumstances) are .as frequently interrupted by rigidity of the os uteri, with or without inflammation, among the laborious negroes of the farm, or the peasants of the thatched hut, as among the most delicate ladies, who live amidst all the luxuries of civi- lization and refinement; indeed, much more so. My opportunities, on this head, are not very li- mited. It avails nothing to say, that we have depart- rsd from the life of the savage, and that an equal departure from the simple dictates of nature, in search of a corrective, is necessary. With the vsavage and with the civilized woman, the mecha- nism of labour is the same. There is a certain piompound resistence to be overcome by the co- o)peration of given forces of expulsion. A change from the savage mode, to that of civilized life, iioes not, and cannot, alter the relation between l:his sum of compound resistence and these forc- es of expulsion. It neither abstracts from the iiggregate of one, nor diminishes the efficiency the other. If the one be altered, the other is equally altered. They are equally dependent ^on the same economy of the general whole. tJ154 Can we believe, with the lecturer, that “ the man (a specifick term, by which an individual i^ put for the kind) of the civilized world, has lost much of his original strength,” he., and yet^ that this man, thus plundered of his powers, is more subject to inflammation, &cc. ? Sir, what do you think of that philosophy which points] out the lax fibre, the body with ruined energies,j as the proper subject of rigidity, the very object eligible for the lancet? Can your ingenuity un- fold to you, how the delicate lady, whose bed is down, and whose life is inaction, can be more) obnoxious to inflammation, rigidity, &c., and better able to bear large abstractions of blood, than the wild savage, whose body, like that o£ the hardy rustick, is braced by exercise, whosq blood is pure and rich, from a simple, yet sub- stantial diet ?* But, to fill up the measure of this singulaij philosophy, the lecturer declares, that, although * We generally find the women of the country more obnox4 ious to it (pain) than those of cities. Museum, Vol- I, No. sj p. 280. Deruees. And this is, I suppose, a logical deduction from the proposi4 tion, that “ pain is produced by civilization and refinement !’t Then the hard-working woman of the city, and the laborious the country, are the civilized ; and the delicate, refined lady o^ the city is the uncivilized woman. Brydone certainly did not? add to the facility of birth with the Sicilian women, that tliey were also “ savages.” In the Museum, ali the advantages are with the lady of the city. In the essay, she has lost every thing “ by civilization and refinement ” See Devices, p- 43, &c.155 the man of the civilized v^orld has lost much of his original strength, “ the circular muscles, the heart and intestines, as far as we can determine, have lost nothing of their primitive powers. Now if the circulation, which depends on the heart, and the digestion, the office of the alimen- tary canal, be in the vigour they were in during the days of our first parents, the man of the ct- vilized world cannot have fallen off much. Where there is a vigorous circulation, and strong digestive powers, the muscular energies ot the body cannot be low. I allude to those muscular energies (I believe the long, straight muscles p be concerned) which qualify the Hibernian, in proud contempt, to poise his shilelah, the nervous Englishman to shake the very walls of the thea- tre of pugilism with loud huzzas, when he has pushed his unequal antagonist on some unresist- ing spot; which qualified the proud Roman to project the coit, or throw the javelin ; the alert Greek, covered with sweat and dust, to carry off the prize in the gymnastick circles ; or braw- ny American to turn, in coarse exultation, from his fallen competitor. The doctrine of the circular muscles is new; 1 am not prepared to receive or admit it. I be- lieve it to be wholly inadmissible, from our pre- sent anatomical knowledge, and social observa- tion.156 strirrprl f ® science, we are necessarily re- stricted from a 1 loose modes of expression wt and "flo indulg-ed in tropes, and figures . ”o»; Xo,°‘^>>0^ -W of decoS “.i throS oflaho.?r?''''‘l '^here the out Zh! iT with- ccount of such a case, except where the sens! bihties were benumbed by stupor, suspended bv syncope, or annihilated by death. ^ ^ an fwt of Boerhaave make but Te^ d^? ‘heir new American ’ dress. doctrines that enlightened science had committed to the stream of time, that they might to cite ‘’'''rered without pain, it would be idle ■aees, Essay, p. practice.-' Ec j 1 ♦ft never met with one of these labours without pain • and ! nor BaudelJ>r*^^^°”’ neither Smellie, nor Hamilton, no?

That pregnancy is a state of disease, was taught by Boerhaave to his pupils, and commented on by Vansweiten, in his illustra- tions of Boerhaave’s Aphorisms.^ It is like ma- ny other discoveries that are now-a-days fallen on. The first few pages of Dr. Dewees’s pamphlet excited my surprize j but, whenT arrived at the . irticle upon blood-letting, I was overwhelmed with astonishment. He gravely tells us, that in labours attended by rigidity of the os uteri, with or without inflammation^ with irregular 'ontraction, &c., the utility of the lancet origi- nated in his own observation, and with himself! That “ in diminishing pain, disposing the os iteri to dilate, the external parts to unfold, &c., )lood-letting originated, as far as I am acquaint- ed, with myself.”t Are all preceding writers * « Morbi gravidarum.” Postquam gravida est foemina, ; lurimis afficitur malis ex sola graviditate oviundis- Boer.

Vansweiten. With parity of reason Boerhaave might have said, that the :nction by which the blood is oxidated is a state, a gradation of = sease, because, in tJie first acts of respiration, children utter >'ws of apparent alarm and pain. Certainly such things can only 3int out to us the present general state of suffering humanity . f Essay, p. 63.158 on general midwifery silent on this head? Oris the Doctor’s reading limited to his own writings? Each writer must speak for himself. “ In lingering labours, when the parts are ri- gid^ if the patient is of a plethorick habit, with quick strong pulse,” says Smellie, “ the contra- ry method (opposed to cordials) is to be used,] such as venesection^ antiphlogistick medicines,”*' &c. Here is the doctrine recognized by oldj Smellie, an unfashionable writer it is true, in allj its principles. He advises venesection in rigi-- dity of the softer parts. For what purpose I Surely “ to dispose them to dilate, to unfold’i before the head of the child, to prevent or cure, as the case might be, inflammation. He coulc not, nor could any other rational man, sugges to us blood letting, merely for the ceremony d the thing. He must have intended it to be its extent commensurate with the circumstance! of the case. Thus, where Baudelocque remarks, that “ a bleeding made to the purpose (a happy expres sion), with emollient, mucilaginous injection^ the warm-bath, &lc , * * * * can relax the rig\ dity of the neck of the womb, and render its d| * Smellie, Vol. I, p. 221. • , I" Une aaignee faite a firo/iosy des injections emolientes mucilagineuses, les bains * * * * pour affoiblir la roideur c col de la matricCy et cnfaciliter l*«uverture,** Tom. par. 11 Baudelocque.159 iatation easy.” He does not restrict us to any given quantity. There is, however, but one thing to be understood. The bleeding is to be “ ^ propos suited to the circumstances of the case, as to extent, and done in time. What rea- sonable man could have said more ? In the same strain, we observe the opinions of Denman to run on “ fever and local inflam- mation*^ frigidity with inflammation). This ex- cellent accoucheur says, that “ It does not seem necessary to bleed every patient on the accession of labour, and for some it would be highly im- proper. But whenever the feverish symptoms become violent, it (blood-letting) is, I believe, universally proper ; the quantity cf blood taken away, being suited to the degree of fever, and to the constitution of the patient.”^ If the fever arises from local inflammation, as we understand from the head of the section, and as there must be pain where there is local inflammation pro- ducing fever, he assuredly prescribed blood-let- ting “ for the diminishing of pain.’* A little farther on, a few pages only, the same judicious man adds: “For the prevention of such difficulties as may attend the first act of parturition, in those who are advanced in age, we have been advised to order frequent and small bleeding towards the conclusion of pregnancy.” *'■' Denman, Vol. II, p. 50, 59.16‘0 For what is this advice ? For no other purpose that I can devise, than “ to dispose the rigid os' uteri to dilate, and the external parts to untold.’' To those already adduced, I will add Hamil-' ton, who tells us, that in “ crampish spasms oti the belly,” or viscera within the belly, we are. to have recourse “ to venesection, glysters. See. And in the subsequent paragraph he subjoins’ that “ inflammatory diathesis, in young subjects of strong rigid fibres, and plethonck habits, must | be obviated b}' venesection, repeated glysters,”* | It will now appear that blood-letting has beep used, by those writers that are well entitled to i a place in the library of every medical gentleman, t “ for diminishing pain, disposing the os uteri to’ dilate, the external parts to unfold,” he.; and that these writers recognize and enforce the doc- trine of blood-letting in its fullest extent, so far as rational men can go. The doctrine, with its | principles, is all that can be contended for. The application must rest with the judgment and dis- cretion of the practising accoucheur. ( In the quotation of the 1960th paragraph of ! Baudelocque, there is great injustice done the learned Frenchman, as it is cited in the thesis. ' Why were the “ proper methods,” so hastily , * Hamilton, p. lo6.161 lassed ovef ? Are they undeserving of notice ? Vhat are those proper methods,” that are to lave place before the accoucheur is to think of he cutting instrument? Turn to paragraph 1145, nd you will see it to be nothing less than what le learned lecturer claims as his discovery, blood-letting,” &c. It may not be amiss to remark, that there are wo states of unyielding os uteri: the one from n inflammatory disposition, the other from a artilaginous state. How the lancet will suc- eed in real cartilage, we are ‘scarcely prepared 0 determine. The bistoury should be the last ling thought on by the accoucheur. This is daudelocque’s doctrine. That, by a loss of blood to any extent what- wer, the practitioner will prevent the disease called the “ swelling of the lower limb of the yying-in woman,” Dr. Dewees will not again as- sert, when he shall have taken a better and near- rr view of that disease. It is as common in fee- lie, exhausted habits, as in robust, plethorick rnes. I write from observation. See also Charles iVhite, of Manchester, Denman, &e. Of cicatrices I have no experience ; but I can, ave no very exalted opinion of that remedy, /rhich, after several repetitions, leaves the case 3D be relieved by the' forceps. The lancet would -e proper without question, so far as irritation X162 and inflammation might be threatened from ilh effects of long-continued, violent throes. from what has been premised, I deduce thj following conclusions : | pregnancy, whether with the savag or civilized woman, is a state of nature, and par lurition an act of nature, but subject to interrup tion by disease. 2. That the doctrine of pregnancy being a dlsi ease is inconsistent with the order of nature, aj variance with common observation, in itself ia defensible, and of the school of Boerhaave. 3. That the rigid os uteri, with or withouj inflammation, is a rare occurrence, there nd being more than ten cases in a thousand of or dinary practice, where the accoucheur would b? called on for the aid of his art. t 4.

It would be well for entlemen, when they enter the room of a lyiug- I patient, to carry with them, not their lancet, )r I have understood that those who wear the word are apt imprudently to use the sword, but good stock of composure and patience, and x)nfidence in the resources and abilities of na- •ure; and, above all, a sound, discriminating, /ell-instructed judgment. Thus provided, I ihink that I can assure them, they will seldom eave the room with feelings ungrateful to them- ;elves, or a reputation disadvantageous to the irt of the accoucheur. In my next speculation, I shall confine my pen :o the mechanism of labour. I shall endeavour ;o demonstrate, that if the lancet will relax the uofter parts through which the child is to pass, it .will also reduce the efficiency of the throes, ne- ::essary to the detrusion of the child ; and, that « This remedy (blood-letting) is by no means a new one,^ in I 'abour ; but employed for the express purpose of diminishing f pain, and subduing the various species of rigidity just spoken of, iand carried to an extent that will ensure these objects, that is, diminishing pain, disposing the os uteri to dilate, the external r parts to unfold, &c., originated, as far as I am acquainted, with. myself.'^ Deweesy Essayy p- 63.

Did Dr, Deweea ever J md Dr. Rush ?164 where one ordinary case will be benefited hundred will be injured, by the lancet. ’ I am yours, &c., haltimove, March iSth, 1807^°”** From Dr. Davidge to Dr. Barton, Dear Sir, IN my last I gave a promise, that, in this ue^to ^ pen to labour; to the symptoms proper to labour- that T° '^hich it is efFectuated: that 1 wou d endeavour to demonstrate labour to be murally and physically painful; and this, rom the present condition of humanity, to be or necessity, and not of contingence. I more- over promised, and in this the promise chiefly consisted, to deipqnstrate the injidmis^ibility, in ordinary, natural labours, of the use of the Ian- ^et; that, in pinety-nine out of the hundred or- atnary labours, it must be productive of unplea- sant consequences to ihe parturient patient, apd, W lep .-'fipipusly used, it ipust retard labour. I now take up my pen to fill up the measure of tny promise.165 We will suppose the woman to be entering on ler ninth month, as, until the first ten days of ;hat shall have elapsed, there is no symptom of ipproaching labour. Within about three weeks ,)f the period of actual parturition, the woman oegins to percieve a subsidence in the epigastrick iind hypochondriack regions. This subsidence is not a mere chimerical deception of the sense of he woman ; it is an actual change, and becomes more and more the subject of regard, untij the period of confinement. This subsidence has neen a source of serious contemplation to the woman ; she has mistaken it as indicative of the death and waste of her infant. With some ac- :oucheurs it has been a subject of idle animad- iversion, being construed into the collection and dispersion of wind in the stomach and bowels ; whilst with others, better trained in the school of observation and experience, it has constituted a part of the uniform design of nature. To those who are acquainted with the regular e^volution of the gravid uterus, I need scarcely rremark, that this evolution is in divisions *, that o:>f these, the fundus may be considered the first ^division, and is the first in evolving ; the corpus 1 the second, and has the second place in suiting . itself to the increased dimensions of the child ; land the cervix as the third, and the last in yield- iingto the growth of the contained foetus. This Hast division does not lend its aid until towards uke eighth month, from which time i^ in regular166 progression evolves to meet the expanding di- mensions of the fcEtus. When this is nearly completed, the child ac- tually occupies a lower part of thepelvick region' than during the sixth and seventh months ; and, about the completion of this evolution of the neck of the uterus, the evolving action of the abdominal muscles begins to change, and give place to the powers of expulsion resident in these muscles, and the longitudirial muscular fibres of the uterus. The uterus, from the interest it has in the general sympathies of the system at large, commands into its private services the aid of the neighbouring muscles. By an absolute impress of foreign agency, in co-operation with its own powers, it begins and carries on the function of expulsion ; and, in the preparation of these muscles for more serious action, we discover the first cause of the first premonitory sign, the subsidence of the abdomen, of ap- proaching labour. At full time, when nine months shall have completed their round, the throes of child-birth come on. They may fortuitously be provoked into untimely action, and produce abortion, or miscarriage ; but their legitimate term is gene^ rally conceded to be that of nine calendar months. Ii it were necessary, in addition to what I have said in my former letter on this subject, to ad- duce evidence in attestation of the fixedness and167 uniformity of the term of labour, I would invite yrour attention to the highly interesting fact, that, if a foetus be extra-uterine, the throes, at full time, will come on with the same force and re- gularity as if the foetus were within the uterus. xHere we have another argument strongly mili- i.ating against the preposterous doctrine, that pregnancy and parturition are grades of dis- jease.” The throes to expel an extra-uterine foe- ms will not be argued to be derived from the ^stimulus of mechanical distention operating on 'the accumulated excitability of the uterus. We ■assuredly deduce these throes from the laws of [he constitution of the mother ; for, in this case, the child is not within the womb, and, of conse- quence, can by no luxuriancy of fancy be sup- posed to excite into action that organ. The term proper to the maturity of the child ibeing elapsed, we discover farther and more (decisive marks of labour to present themselves. IBut, before I proceed to the physical properties ; of the womb, I must say something on the mo- iral necessity of pain. What I mean by the moral necessity of pain, iit may be proper, in a succinct manner, to ex- plain. Notwithstanding the general sympathies (of the body may, and to my apprehension do, jgrow out of the common constitution and eco- inomy of body, and would, without the irans- igression of man, have been attended by flea*168 suieable sensations in the various operations o| which they are the source, yet I find no difficuh ty to concieve that those sympathies, in theiii laws the same, may be accompanied by unplea-j sureable sensations in the functions or conditions to which they give origin. i In the first period of conception, upon the supposition that Eve had remained in her origi-, nal paradisaical estate, I can conceive that allj the associated actions would have afforded plea-: sure ; that the very associated action of the sto- mach, which, in the piesent condition of woman^ causes distress, could, under the state alluded to, have produced happiness. The body has been, for some time previous to conception, accustomed to have separated from its common circulating mass a peculiar liquor to a given quantity. Upon conception in the gene* ral, this particular excretion (the menses) ceas- es to be thrown off; the body no longer, from its altered condition, throws off this excrementi- tious fluid, no longer can it need the same sup- ply of aliment; and hence is the general inappe- tency of pregnant women for food during the first two or three months, until, by the bulk of the child, greater demands shall be made on the general constitution, and, of course, on the sto- mach. From this I wish it to be understood, that the sickness and uneasiness of breeding, as it is usu-169 ally phrased, is a moral consequence, while the inappetency for food is, from a law of the female habit, under the control of ovarious influence. Therefore, when wc speak of the diseases of pregnancy, I hope that it will be always con- ceived, that we do not have allusion to this con- stitutional association between parts, nor to the distress consequent on this associated action, which, in itself, in a higher or lower degree, howsoever opposed by human skill, is insepara- . ble from the present condition of humanity,: and forms one among the many irrefutable facts on which rests the authenticity of the biblc. Castellio's Versiojst. « Deinde ad mulierem: Ego te multis doloribua, inquit, aerum- ;usque afficiam, tu natqs cww paries.’* Gen. cap. iii. Vi la. From tills serious part of my letter, you are ■ not to anticipate a formal discourse on theology. T*his excerption from sacred history is at present ; necessary to, and may have an advantageous i place in, our discussion. Were it a light mat- iter which at this moment solicits our attention II should most sedulously have avoided an ap- ipeal to that authority; the sacredness of which T renders it inaccessible, either in languagd of vvriting, except when in our solemn, serious me-' ditation, in the stillness of spiritual contempla- ition, we approach, with a trembling dread and ^awful apprehension, to enquire into its momen- tous doctrines, to hear the great ever-living En-170 tity unfold, injustice, wisdom, and celestial dig* nity, his irreversible purposes to deciduous man! It is palpable, and bears with irresistible con- yiction on the mind, that the above address to Eve was not directed and limited to her as an in- dividual ; it was addressed to her with a mean- ing diffusive and general, terminable only by ihe limits of her descendants ; as woman ; as the mother of all human females. TThis heavy denunciation was fulminated a- gainst woman, in the same spirit, under the same circumstances, and for the same high crime, as against Adam was launched the terrible me- nace, “ pulvis es, et in pulverem redibis.” This was uttered against Adam as man, the father and head of all living. Both were levell- ed against our kind, and not restricted to early ^ges, particular nations, or certain individuals. A few men, by miracle or special favour, have had, in relation to themselves, this malediction rescinded, btit W€ know of no women or race of tVomen, savage or civilized, to whom the curse does not extend, “ with pain shalt thou bring forth children.” When men cease to be mortal, women will be blessed with painless births. The text in the English version is very ob- scure and indefinite ; I therefore have preferred that bf'the learned Dastellio, who, in the opini- of the most able criticks, stands among the171 foremost in Hebrew literature. And it affords me great pleasure to find that the sense of Cas- tellio is confirmed by the Greek* and French.f Superadded to what this laborious Hebrician gives in the text, he assures us, in his foot-note, that the words, strictly translated, are “ est do- lor pariendi.” And to it, I am sure, all women, who have borne children, and are in the posses- sion of a sound mind, will most willingly sub- scribe. Dr. Dewees indulges in a most curious anno- tation on the text as it stands in the English ver- sion. He most gravely labours to prove, that the word sorrow’' does not, in any part of the sacred writings, mean an uneasy corporeal sen- sation. It would have been great gratification to all biblical scholars, had the Doctor dilated a ; little more on the general sense of the text, and , given us * a full commentary on ‘‘ I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception / in sor- row shah thou bring forth children.” Perhaps 'k would have appeared, in the course of hisdis- I course, that woman, in consequence of her de- i fection, had become more prolifick; for to mul- • “ In the Greek version, or Septuagint, the word sorrow is tendered AuTraj, which signifies pains or sickness,** fee.

What can be inferred from “ I will greatly multiply thy conception,” &cc.? Mothing, but that' the whole is incorrect, and a stupid blunder of the translator. The Doctor says, that it was not a punishment for transgression, but the mere result of accident or civilization. And yet the very version, and every other version, on which he offers his annotation, expressly declares, “be- cause thou hast done this,” &tc., &,c. The tonick and clonick powers of the uterus, together with the contractions of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm, are the only actions al- leged and recognized, by the concurrent autho- rity of accoucheurs, as contributing their agen- cy to the expulsion of a child from the gravid uterus. If there be others, I am unacquainted with them. All voluntary effort is both useless and improper. THE TONICK POWER. i It appears to be understood among accouch-j ^rs, yet not with the full and expressed con-^ sent of anatomy, that there is^in the uterus a double set of fibres ; the one circular, the other longitudinal. The circular fibres are diffused equally throughout the uterus; its fundus, its corpus, its cervix? In these fibres is resident173 the tonick or elastlck power. It perpetually urg* cs the gravid uterus to recover upon itself, as the French would speak ; and no sooner do the throes, co-operating with the circular fibres of the fundus and corpus uteri, discharge the li- quor amnii, than the whole of the walls of the uterus, the circular fibres of the cervix, with those of the other parts, close about the child, and in this state would the hapless fcetus, im- mured within its narrow habitation, remain, un- til death and putrefaction should waste it away, were not the revival and reiteration of the throes to impel it to the v/orld. The circular fibres of the cervix are forced in- :o obedience by the superior power of the throes, of which I shall presently speak. The tonick or elastick power never ceases to act when once called on by the laws of the constitution, and 'provoked by a source of distension within the :cavity of the uterus ; and no sooner is the child 'expelled with its appendages, than this tonick )oower gathers the uterus up nearly to its origi- nal dimensions. Of this tonick action the wo- man has no consciousness : it perpetually urg- ?es, yet without pain. “ 1. That the circular fibres may contract to almost any degree, without being attended with •pain. 2. That their contraction alone, howe- ver violent, does not forward the child- 3. That lEhey do not possess the power of alternate con-174 traction in the same degree as the longitudina fibres ; and, that they may exert this power, ^ is necessary at first to have them distracted b] some force or other,” concludes Dr. Dewees from previous facts or propositions. Permit me respectively to invite your attentioi to these words from the essay of your lecture! and impress your mind with their value: I ir tend, from them and their consequences, to es tablish the important fact, that the lancet, in m ordinary^ regular labour, can afford the pract^ tioner any possible aid, but must of necessitj embarrass the natural progression of the partu rient act, and disappoint the accoucheur wh^ has unwarily trusted to it. ' In no instance whatever has a child been dei livered by the lonick power of the womb, Ii the case recorded by Levret, and the few other collected by writers, although the child was de livered after the death of the mother, its hea< must have been in the smaller basin of the pel vis, that is, without the os internum, and in th vagina, otherwise it is very obvious, from wha Dr. Dewees writes, and every other man mus believe, that it must have remained with th' mother. THE CLONICK POWER. This power of alternate contraction and re laxation, and acting at certain periods or inter175 rals, is a property of the longitudinal fibres of he womb, associated with a synchronous action if the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. The bdominal muscles and diaphragm are brought ito service by a constitutional sympathy be- Aveen them and the uterus, such as obtains be- ween them and the stomach in paroxysms of ex- essive sickness. These alternate contractions nd relaxations, or clonick actions, constitute le real throes or pains of labour. They are niformly, except in stupor, accompanied by an neasy corporeal sensation, and hence areterm- ■ d throes or pains. The word throe itself is from le Saxon term, to suffer. No throe can have -lace without the consciousness of the woman, xcept, as above remarked, under an affection P the common sensibilities of the body; and, ithout a throe, the gravid uterus can never dis- icumcer itself of its burthen. In every throe there is more or less of an un- isy sensation of the loins, haunches, or uterine gion. At times, the lower extremities are dis- .sssed with most unpleasant feelings. In cas- i of convulsion during labour, the convulsive Ffection simulates very much, in its periodical xurrences, the genuine labour-pains. From the antecedent premises, I deduce the ct, that, as “the tonick power, howevervio- nt, does not forward the child,” and as there ' no third agency alleged or recognized by phy-176 biologists or accoucheurs in the expulsion of the child, there cannot possibly be an act of partu- rition without throes or pains. Assuredly the most emhusiastick theorist, wh& dreams out his cases in his closet, is not prepar-i ed to admit or maintain that throes can be pre-< sent, and yet the woman feel no corporeal dis^ tress. This were an absurdity too monstrou^ for any sane mind to contemplate, but with dis- gust and abhorrence. I shall now proceed to the examination of ihaJ philosophy which instructs in the abstraction o^ blood from a general system of vessels, in ordei to relax a particular set only. This general sys- tem, we may observe, goes off from the sam^ heart; is mutually in its parts dependent, and between which parts there is a constant recipro- cation of good offices, or injuries, with a conti- nued, uninterrupted circulation of the same com- mon mass of fluid. The circulation througl] this general system being continuous, and,, as M were, in a circle, any quantity of blood abstract^ ed must immediately, and in the ratio of the dii ameter of each vessel, influence each and everj part of the general whole equally. .. If any loss of blood will relax the os uteri, va- gina, and loca muliebria* speak of these part^ — i *■ i^eci niuUebres, vel loca muliebria, are by some classiclt writers preferred, when tliey speak of the genital parts of iht human female, while tiiey rather restrict tlie expression pudem17 f ih their ordinary state, free from inftammation, rigidity, or spasm, such as ninety-nine of a hun- dred labours will be the case), will it not like- wise prostrate, in a higher or lower degree, the expulsive forces of the uterus, abdominal mus^ cles, and diaphragm, and equally in their rela- tion ? It must unquestionably, and leave the re- sistance to be overcome, and the powers of ex- pulsion, in the same relation to each other that they were previously to the use of the lancet. Whatever be the quantity of blood, its rela- tive effects must be the same. If even the wo- man be reduced to syncope, the child remains in the womb; for where there is syncope, there xan be no clonick action, and the child will not be born until the woman shall be restored to her powers. During utero-gestation, if a woman has in- :cautiously, by excessive exercise, roused the (heart and arteries, or the circulation has been aaccelerated by intellectual emotions, or a fever has been kindled up, the accoucheur abstracts ■blood: but for what ? to relax the parts through which the child is to pass in its birth ? by no (means. His object is to bring the body more or less to a state of relaxation or syncope, and thus Ida to the genital parts of the female brute. But, perhaps, they uare equally proper, and may be used accordiae f the taste ar "haite ©f the writer. Z178 to lower the powers of expulsion, to quiet the parturient throes, and save his patient from miscarriage. If, then, during utero-gestation, we are to prevent premature birth by the ab- straction of blood, why, and how, are we to fa- cilitate parturition by the lancet at full time ? Will not the effects generally be the same ? Un- doubtedly so. We think correctly, when we believe that na- ture has as wisely ordered the relation of her powers in the act of parturition, as she has re- gulated the graduation of the stimulus of the blood to the irritability of the heart. Not indeed to a mathematical balance, but, according to her own liberal scheme, admitting of some extra- vagance and aberration. Therefore, every light disease, or improper interference of art, cannot throw her from her design. Any given quantity of blood, whether from the arm or uterus, should, to my understanding, affect the general system, and, of consequence, every part similarly ; and a relaxation of the bo- dy, or complete syncope, must be equal, in what manner soever induced. Hence I infer, that no woman should die from flooding; at least with-i out being first disburthened of her load: nor indeed could she possibly die of flooding before the birth of her child, if the doctrine, embracedi by the principles inculcated by the friends of syncope being the immediate path to easy and179 rapid labour, were founded in the laws which regulate nature. I write from observation ; I am an accouch- eur, and have witnessed the effects of bleeding in ordinary labours: it is true, not in my own patients, except such as have become so secon- darily. As to labours attended by morbid phe^ nomena, I have already spoken of them in my first letter. The use of the lancet, in such, is recommended and enforced almost by every wrU ter on general midwifery, for fifty or a hundred years back. My present letter only relates to ordinary labour, and neither of them to preter- natural or laborious labour. When we talk of relaxing the vagina and ex- ternal parts by the lancet, in common labour^ we use a sort of language too mechanical, and in no respect applicable to the affair of which wc speak. This relaxation, as we are pleased to term it, of the soft parts, is a peculiar and in- scrutable evolution or unfolding, which may suggest to us a high veneration for that wisdoni which ordered the plan of the parts and their functions ; and certainly we may be content with the knowledge of the fact, without entangling ourselves in useless researches after physiology; researches that will ever be unsuccessful, and will only serve to teach us humility. At best, the science of physiology is" a science 6f conjecture. We know tlie orgafis, and we180 learn the result of their operations ; but of the causation, the physiology of the thing, we know nothing, whether we speak of the uterus, the iiver, the brain, or any other organ. This same unintelligible, mechanical language has been as fruitlessly applied to the explication ot the evolution of the gravid uterus. Like the gravid uterus, the vagina and external parts ^o ve by the particular physical properties of the parts themselves. These properties or laws are a pait of the wonderful economy of nature 5 they are called into service by powers of the fe- male constitution, and should have taught pro. fessors that parturition is not a “ grade of dis. ease.’* So soon as disease fully takes place, this natural evolution ceases, and art must open it§ resources, I may add, before I close, a few animadversions on the general though reprehensible practice among accoucheurs of artificially supporting the perinaeum during the last act of the parturient operation, as if nature called more for adscititi- | ous aid in one step of her course than in another. , Can there be any thing more gross and excep- tionable in the eye of enlightened philosophy than the supposition that more aid from art would be required to facilitate the passage of the child through the os externum than would be demand- ed for its passage through the os internum.^ Sure- ly gentlemen are not serious in their advocation181 this relick of folly, this remain of mistake, [t were as rational and becoming to renew the Dleadings and reasonings for the baths and ma- cerations to relax the ligaments of the pelvis that t might enlarge in its diameter and afford facili- ies to the descent of the child, as to appeal to irt to aid its egression from the Vagina. Are those efforts to sustain the perinaeum and lave it from laceration the dictates of experience .—the doctrine enjoined on the practitioner by he language of observation ? certainly not. If eft to itself the evolution of the external, soft Darts will go on as regularly and safely as that of he mouth of the womb. How difficult it is for he accouchevir to learn a negative science, to mow that in the general he has no duty to per- brm beyond the simple acts of receiving the child, fecuring the cord, and taking the afterbirth from he vagina ! An humble office it is true, yet )ne with which modest intelligence is content. [The man of science reserves himself for scenes : f danger and trial, where nature is forced from ler ground, or is failing under a load of difficuh yy. Then by a dextrous application of the im-. oortant rules furnished by his art, he comes to ler relief and guides her through her perils. I am yours, &c. John B% DavipgK;, 13altimoref April lOth^ 1807*18^ From Dr. Davidge to Dr, Smith. Dear Sir, TO your polite favour I should have return- ed an earlier answer, but for a disability of mj right hand, occasioned by a slight and transiem casualty. That you “ will derive pleasure” frorr a correspondence with me, is both flattering anc gratifying; but when you demand “ improve ment,” you will permit me to admonish you tc make your drafts on other banks than those ovei which I have control, lest, from a deficiency it credit on my part, your bills return dishonoured The Jiosology of a wounded artery is interest- ing and highly important. Its range in conse- quences, in all serious, indeed trivial wounds is great, and well entitled to the attention of the surgeon. You will not, my friend, be startled at the sound of the word nosology^ the object of whicl] is, an inquiry, you know, into the nature, the symptoms^ and consequences of diseases ; except indeed, you have become a convert to the nevi philosophy of the day—except you consider no- sology as an unfit subject for the present enlighti ened period, believing that in dark periods of ig norance, when gross night overshadowed the- I 183 .chools, such stupid themes had an apology in he dull, unimproved state of the times. But low that a beam of new light has awakened the aedical world from its long and deep slumber, ou may imagine that a subject more ennobled »y novelty, would be less unbecoming. Be it , o; and let my present mention of it find an ex- use in my early prejudices. But I widely mis- : alculate if I do not in some little speculation, Thich, if I can rouse myself from my indolence, intend to send you, demonstrate that where ne- ology ends, medicine ceases to be a science. 'But to the subject of the present letter, lest you hink that I have designedly strayed to hunt up he errors of great men. , ^ A sword passes through the fore-arm, and ome small arteries, with a larger one, the ra- cial, ulner, or interosseous for instance, are livided. The blood pours furiously out for a dme, but is, by coagulation of the effused fluid, i.nd the coarse means externally applied by the ■amily, or some generous neighbour, stanched, ffhe surgeon arrives, and finds all things quiet, .lilthough in homely order. He feels reluctant CO open anew the vessels by breaking up the iressing; and begins to hope and persuade him- ielf that the hasmorrhagy will not recur. How vain and illusory! In a day or two the haemorrhagy breaks out .;igaln, and is again checked; and thus I have184 seen matters proceed, for two and three weeks, until the hand, wrist, and fore-arm have been completely injected, and the patient exhausted to the extremest degree. And what does all thi^ arise from ? From one of three things. The surgeon has read, or heard, for all ouij surgeons do not read, that if the lips of th^ wound in an artery be coaptated, whether b)i good luck or artificial means, they will unite afj ter the manner of a vein, the gluten being pour] cd out by the vasa vasorum. Or, if the arter)i be completely divided, it will contract up to it^ first branch. Or, a coagulum without and with- in, will form, and serve as a stopple to the arte- ry. And in this last, countenanced by the doc^ trine of the vitality of the blood, he begins t3 imagine to himself, or talk to those about him. how this coagulum forms its new vessels, andl how they stretch out towards the walls of the artery, and how, by uniting with the sides, thq plug is secured. Here are three sources of er-< ror in the surgeon, and danger to the patient. I hold it as an axiom in the surgery of a woundn ed artery, that no hsemorrhagy from an artery will cease, except the sides come into close con4 tact and union. In the smaller arteries, I conceive, that, byj the effused and coagulated blood without andj about the sheath of an artery, its sides are forcH cd into union j that is, that they come into con*-185 lact; that the vessels of the internal coat are ex cited, and take on that action which brings about what surgeons call the union by the first inten- don. What is it in those smaller vessels which, af- ter the patient is put to bed—his heat restored—- and the re^ action established, causes the recur- rence of the haemorrhage ? Plainly and palpably the increase of the current of blood forcing open the mouths of the divided arteries, in opposition to the mechanical pressure without; not the heat or any other cause relaxing the contraction ^f the extremity of the arteries. And what is it.in the larger arteries which caus- •;s them again and again to pour out their blood ? [To my understanding, the putrefaction and melt- ng down of this coagulum, to which the surge- on unhappily trusts. And as often as the coa- gulum forms, the haemorrhage is stopped ; and IS often as it begins to putrify, and melt down, i .nd fall away, the haemorrhage returns. If there ae a coagulum within at all, it is too insignifi- j ant to be noticed; and, it will ultimately de- i ieve the surgeon. I do not speak from conjec- mre ; nor do I rest on the highly respectable luthority of Mr. John Bell, who appears to be lestined, in his luminous course, to give light 3 the universe of surgery. But, as I had the i*leasure of mentioning to you, I have had an o pportunity of dissecting two stumps, at the dis- 2 A186‘ tance of thirty odd days from the period of ope ration. In which, when the vessels were neatj ly and fairly exposed, they were found complete ly cylindrical and open down to one eighth of a] inch of the very extremity. The wall that clo^ ed up and formed the end, was but very little if any, thicker than the sides measured at anj place above in the most healthy parts. Here was no coagulum, no plug, no convei] sion into ligament up to the first branch. Bu the lumen arterise was open and free down t^ the very point where the ligature closed upoi the walls. This dissection was nearly fort^ days from the period of operation, and yet th< artery had all the characters of health-—its coati having no marks of thickness in any part. There were several medical gentlemen pre sent daring this dissection, and among them m3 ingenious and learned colleague, Dr. Cocke; a gentleman well known to you for his politeness* suavity of manners, and intimate knowledge o; the healing art; and whose mind, we may sup* pose, was well prepared to detect any circumi stance that might militate against the doctrine^ of the schools in which he had been educated—t those of London and Philadelphia; and in thosq schools the doctrines of contraction and coagu- lation have certainly not been without friends. But from what 1 have advanced you are nol to infer, that I deny the possibility of a union oi187 the sides of the vessel, up to the first braneh, I admit it; but not from contraction, nor coagu- lation, but from the walls of the artery being forced into contact by mechanical agency; and this would happen not only up to the first branch, but up as high as the mechanical force acted. At first, immediately on tying of the vessel, there may be, and really is, a coagulum with- in—-yet this soon melts down, and is mixed with the common circulating mass. And here the surgeon is deceived. He takes the column of jelly, in a few weeks to be melted away? for liv- ing substance, filling up the tube. Yourself and every other gentleman accus- tomed to the knife, knows, from repeated obser- vation, that when an artery is divided, it retracts^ land draws itself up within its cellular sheath; :but the contraction of a divided arlery even in a ' slight degree is to be conceded with caution. If an artery is to be provoked by adventitious stif rmulus, it will contract; and this so long as its excitability shall be exposed to foreign stimula- tion. But it is not on this that the surgeon is to ; depend. It is uncertain, irregular, and of small : compass, When an artery is divided, lies exposed, and i has its calorick with the fluid, which fills its vasa vvasorum, to fly off, it is possible that its canal rnxaybe diminished below the natural state of its, systole; though this is too lanimportant to be188 brought into account; and I am induced to con- sider the contraction of an artery an imaginarv thing, equally illusory with the coagulum with- m the artery, the plug or stopple of which sur] geons delight to speak. i Mr. John Bell says, “ that an artery, in the moment of being divided, may be made to re-u- nite, I hold to be an absolute fact, not becausd It IS proved by the authority of those who have prevented aneurisms by a skilful compress ; for^ in such cases the aneurism being prevented, wei are still left in doubt, whether the artery was actually wounded ! but the aneurismal varix as- certains the fact.” vol. i. page 211. ^ Most singular indeed ! that an aneurismal va- rix ascertains the fact, that the lips of a wound in an artery adhere, if laid well together at the moment the artery is wounded. Or should we not say, that of all facts, the aneurismal varix gives the most decided proof that the wound has not united : for, in the aneurismal varix, the lips of the wound of the artery adhere to the fascia below, while those of the vein adhere to the fas- cia above, by means of the intermediate cellular substance. If the lips of the artery were united, there could no longer exist an aneurismal varix, as the current of blood from the artery which Constitutes the disease, would be cut off by the closing of the aperture in the artery. Even Ulysses would not at all times pass the arrow189 through the ring, were Minerva to leave hi$ side. My opinion is, that we should secure every injured artery by the regular compress or liga- ture, doing b)' art what must be done by acci- dent, if the hsemorrhage cease ; for I do not he- sitate to lay it down as a grave and serious fact, that the walls of every artery must come into contact, and its lumen be obliterated, when a wound in an artery is successfully managed. I am fully aware, that many, and able surgeons, are of a different opinion; and that arteries are kept to show the gelatine up the tube, and con- solidation up to the first branch- This gluten, it\o doubt, with all its appearance of commencing !>rganization, would have been gradually carri- ed away, had the patient lived but a few weeks, irhe serum and red globules, we all know, quick- ;.y run off, and after a time, as assuredly, the imore tenacious or viscid gluten is dissolved. This we see when clots of blood are laid on healthy r^ranulating wounds—when long compressed in !,he uterus, &c. And the consolidation up to the first or se- cond branch, is equally obvious. The walls are n contact; a slight action, approaching to that )f inflammation, takes place, and a cord of more >r less thickness, is leift to deceive the surgeon. The case, so frequently referred to, and so nuch confided in by surgeons, by Lambert, of190 Newcastle upon Tyne, is far from deciding ev- en the possibility of the re-union of the lips of a wounded artery, much less that it is to be ge- nerally expected. 'When in a numerous series of experiments, one only is to appearance successful, we should be extremely careful how we extend our confi- dence. I am, in all these solitary instances of success,, much inclined to doubt, and feel it my duty to guard myself from deception, by criti- cally and severely exainining into the circumstan- ces of the case. There are against Lambert’s case many weigh- ty objections. He tells us, and upon his words I shall take the affair, that, a small steel pin, rather more than a quarter of an inch long, was passed through the two lips of the wouud in th« artery, and secured by twisting a thread round it, as in the hair lip. This was found to stop^ the bleeding,” &tc, > i Whether the discharge of blood was arrested! by the pin, with the thread about it, approximat-' ing the lips, and wholly closing the aperture in, the artery, to me very questionable. I rath-.j er conceive it to, have been from the bulk of the| pin and thread pressing, so as mechanically toj close up the diameter of the vessel. And this, pressure was undoubtedly increased by the bind-; ing up the arm: for in a wound so extensive as; to expose the brachial artery at the fold of thei191 elbow, the consequent inflammation and swell- ing could not have been inconsiderable. The pressure must increase momentally with the inflammation and tumefaction. And, in fact, if at first the anterior wall of the artery was not in contact with the posterior, it must have been so about the fourth day, the period at which “ the wound was first drest.” This, my conjecture, is strongly corroborated, by the fact of the pin coming away with the dress- ings on the fourteenth day. Here it is certain that the anterior part of the artery must have been affected with high inflammation, and even gangrene and sloughing, or the pin could not have come away with the dressing. It otherwise would have remained for the surgeon to draw out, having previously disengaged the thread. It is clear, and beyond a question, that the front of the vessel mortified and sloughed. Can you conceive it probable, that in a vessel so small, and pressed on as this must have been, the an- terior portion of its circle could inflame, gan- grene, and fall away, and yet its lumen to be preserved, and a current of blood to continue down through it ? If so, your conception is more sprightly and ingenious than mine. But the surgeon says, that “ the pulse was very little altered immediately after the opera- tion,” “ and so strong and equal, that he had no doubt of the blood continuing to circulate freely192 through it.” What! is there no way but the great trunk for the blood to get into the radial and iilner arteries ? Are there no anastamosing branches which might possibly convey it down,; and thus support the pulsation of the radial or ulner artery ? I have seen, and any surgeon may see when he pleases, the upper portion o^ the temporal artery beat freely and strongly when its trunk below has been absolutely cut asunder by the shoulder of the lancet; not sure- ly by a continuance of the circulation through the trunk, but by the return blood through the anastamosing branches. Superadded to the chance by tho collateral branches, is it not possible, and indeed highly probable, that in this solitary case of success, the great trunk may have divided, high up in the arm, and of consequence a large portion of the blood would go off, and thus support the pulsa- tion below ? That the diameter of the artery was complete- ly annihilated, all the circumstances of the case tend to prove. And as to the pulsation below, I can readily conceive it to be kept up by the cir- culation through the anatomising branches, as, already remarked, or the possible lusus naturae, the branching off, high up the arm, of the radi- al trunk. And had the arm upon the death of the patient been injected, we have every reason to believe the canal ofthe artery would have been193 iound obstructed. Vide Med. Observ. vol i. p, 360. There is another circumstance of arterial haj« morrhagy, which at present solicits my attention. I allude to the frequent recurrence ot hsemorrh- age after the operation, for the popliteal aneu- rism, when the operation is performed in the front of the thigh. There is nothing in the na- ture of a femoral artery aneurismal in the ham, which should make it subject to hsemorrhagy. 'The fault, without doubt, must be solely in the manner of securing the vessel. I need not en- ter minutely into detail of the various methods of doing this plain affair—the ligatures of reserve "“■the metallick plates—the modes of confining oops, he. They all tend more or less to break jp the connections of the vessel with the sur- rounding parts. They deprive it of nourishment, oy cutting off its channels of support. The ve- ;y solicitude to secure the vessel, together with its being left continuous and undivided, has i>een the source, of all the evil. What could be requisite to produce hsemorrh- ggy in an artery, more than to have it insulated —cut off from all the neighbouring parts—bed- ied in pus and coagulated blood ? Surely nothing, ^ow could its private ceconomy be maintained, > vhen the very instruments of support were de- t.troyed, when the blood could qo longer flow to ts bare and exposed walls ? 2 B194 And after Joiin Bell had writen so ably and intelligibly about a plain fact, which, to be un- derstood, needed only to be pointed out, how could he suffer his trancendent pen to encumber itself with that mongrel, equivocal philosophy, that so unintelligibly discourses of “ the artery being eroded by the foul pus ?” The idea oi the sides of an artery being eroded by foul pus, is so far below that clear and luminous philoso- phy which so vividly shines through every pari of Bell’s great work—the greatest of surgical works—^that I can scarcely consent that it shall stand in the splendid copy I possess. Whatt more need he have said, than that the vessel was insulated, and without support ? Con sequently its walls must die, mortify, and fal away ; and thus would the blood burst out. Tc Bell we owe much in many things, especially for what he has written on the arteries. To wha he has said about the manner of managing the affair, I can add nothing. Baltimore^ July 25^/i, 1809-195 From Dr, Davidge to Dr. Smithy Dear Sir, WHEN I did myself the pleasure of address* ing to you my former letter, on the pathology- of wounded arteries, I had not seen the work of Dr. Jones on that subject, and all I knew of the work, I collected from the desultory conversa- tion I had with you. Not having seen the work, I could have no speclfick objects against which I might direct my observations. The principles of Jones I conceived to be erroneous, and, at the moment, offered a few reasons, on which I thought them inadmissible ; I further added to those reasons, in my letter to you, and now hav- ing, by your courtesy, the work before me, I shall present, in full, my objections to his doc? trines. The Doctor has managed his subject with much ingenuity; his language is easy, perspi? cuous, and rises to elegance ; the plan and or? der of his experiments are natural and unexcep- tionable ; but I cannot grant my approbation to the manner in which he has found-it convenient to represent the various results of his numerous experiments. With the results, as they stand, I am particularly gratified. Nor have I the slightest wish to deduct frqr^ their force. I ad^196 • ri imt them all their influence ; but I cannot agree to the interpretation the Doctor has put upon them. I must assume the right of inquiring into, and minutely weighing the experiments in their circumstances ; I expect to show a preponder- ance different from that given by the Doctor, to the publick. Nothing is more palpable to my understanding than that, in his laboured work, Jones has ascribed more importance and efflei- ency to some of the circumstances than can just- ly be attributed to them ; and that he has over- looked the more immediate relations between them and the results. If I can, without offering violence to the ge- neral tenor of the facts, or shading any one part to the disadvantage of another, satisfactorily ex- plain to you that the Doctor has not been happy in his deductions, I shall consider myself fortu- nate ; but yet I shall do no more than justice to my undertaking. In some place of Bacon’s elaborate work he has remarked that, in the explication of any phe- nomenon, more causes than are adequate and necessary should not be adduced. This grave apothegm is the suggestion of a cautious and circumspect philosophy j a philosophy luminous and observant. This caution arose out of a clear conviction, furnished by years of accurate and attentive observation, and it should ever be kept n view by those who may come before the pub-197 lick, engaged either in the illustration of old principles, or the establishment of new hypothe- ses. There is nothing more usual in the institution of experiments, for the ascertainment of any fact, than for the experimenter to enter on the affair with his mind more or less bent up to his purpose. In his closet he anticipates what he wishes to find in his experiments, and in his ex- periments he is sure to discover what he has al- ready anticipated We first enlist our prejudic- es and affections in behalf of our doctrines, and then the illusions of the circumstances not un- frequently flatter us, that our experiment has af- brded the clearest verification of our hypothesis. I do not premise this, to excite any undue ^repossession against the deductions drawn from Ihe experiments of Dr. Jones ; far from it : I wish these experiments to be open to a fair ana- lysis and honourable discussion. I would not trouble you with this criticism, lad not Dr. Jones laid open anew the avenues )f error, which had been so judiciously narrow- ^:d, and in a great degree closed by Pouteau and 'Bell. For, although to surgeons of experience ind accurate observation, to say that we are to rust to spontaneous contractions of divided ar- eries ; or to clots blocking up the canal of an trtery ; or finally and permanently mending an hperture in the side of a punctured vessel, would198 be unproductive of serious consequences; yet to minds untrained in the school of practice, those reveries of the closet serve as most fatal lessons. Upon the first authority, I can assure you that we are not without example in this city of the application of this doctrine of spontaneouj^ contraction and natural coagulation, to the great disappointment of the surgeon, and fatal result to the patient. Indeed, to me this return to th^ obsolete doctrines of Petit and Kirkland, is lit^ tie better than the revival of the old affair of th^ \\ronders wrought by stypticks, &ic. upon the ali tar of which so many thousand lives have beerj immolated. But that I may not appear to wisl; to preoccupy your mind in behalf of what 1 anj about to say on the experiments of the Doctor, ] will present them, in their prominent and mosj characteristick features, to you, along with mj| remarks. To be particular, which I intend to be, I mus unavoidably be a little prolix; too much so foj a letter ; but the importance of the subject mu^ serve as my apology. Preparatory to the discussion of the mai points more immediately the subjects of cons: deration, it may not be amiss to premise a fe) observations, on the structure of arteries, an also on their general function, viz. their proces in receiving and distributing the blood. On thi general function, the Doctor has been rathe silent. '199 The substance of which atteries are com* posed is divided into distinct parts,” says the Doctor, “ which have been called tunicks or coats* Three coats, which have received vari- ous names, can be readily demonstrated, and may be simply and clearly distinguished by the terms, internal, middle, and external. “ The internal coat, although extremely thin, is very close in its texture, and gives to an arte- ry a smooth and polished lining; it is elastick and firm, considering its delicate structure, in the longitudinal direction, but so weak in the circular as to be very easily torn by the slight- est force applied in that direction. The morbid changes which have been observed in it, prove that this coat is vascular, and some experiments have been related to show the probability of its being sensible. “ The middle coat, which is thickest, is form- ed by numerous layers of firm, compact, fleshy fibres, of a pale red colour, passing in a circu- ar direction, but appearing rather obliquely con- nected and interlain with each other, than form- ! ng complete circles. These fibres are of a pe- culiar nature, are well supplied with nerves, and resemble, in form and disposition, muscular fi- bres, but differ from them in possessing a re- markable degree of elasticity. Their elasticity iceeps a dead artery open and circular ; for this coat, when detached from the internal and ex-200 ternal coats, still preserves the cylindrical form, whilst they, on the contrary, in a state of sepa- ration, become flaccid, and collapse. As this coat has no longitudinal fibres, the circular fibres are held together by a slender connection, which yields readily to any force applied in the circum-' ference of the artery. The middle coat is inti-j mately connected with the internal and external| by a very short and fine cellular membrane. “ The external coat, anatomically considered,| is so simple, that many authors have thought] it sufficient to say, that it is formed of condens-J ed cellular membrane, which, by becoming gra-| dually of a looser texture, connects the artery with the surrounding parts ; but the importancd which is attached, in a surgical view, to thid coat, render!^ a more particular account of ii highly necessary and interesting. Although ul- timately resolvable into cellular membrane, yei it derives from the particular arrangement of it^ component fibres, a characteristick appearance which distinguishes it from cellular membrane and entitles it to be ranked as a proper coat of ar artery* Internally, or next to the middle coat its texture is close and smooth ; externally, mor< open and rough, in consec[uence of the cellula membrane by which it is connected with an ad ditional covering. The whole is remarkable fo its whiteness, density, and great elasticity. ^ ujn cLVtevy be suwounded by a ligatuve^ its middl and internal coats will be as completely divided h\201 It as they can be by a knife, zahilst the external coat remains entire ; a fact which v/ill be commented ipon in another part of this treatise, and shown :o be connected with important circumstances, rhe strength, therefore, of any artery depends ihiefiy on its external coat, which answers in some respects, the purpose of a strong fascia.’’ The abov^e quotation I consider to be neces- iary, not because you and I could not recollect .vhat anatomists have advanced on the struc- ;ure of arteries, or what we ourselves have de- aionstrated it to be, but because, being in lan- guage peculiar to, and admitted in doctrine by Dr. Jones, 1 can the more easily show that his )hysioiogical and pathological observations are lot always on the best terms with each other. According to its structure, as above develop- 'd, if an artery be wounded transversely, the dges of the wound recede to a certain distance rom each other ; if it be wounded longitudinal- y, the lips of the incision in the same manner, or the fibres of the middle coat are nearly cir- ular, retire from each other, leaving a longi- aidinal chasm ; and if an artery be completely divided in its transverse direction, the extremi- ies retract, the one towards the breast, the i>ther from it, to a considerable distance ; but fie diameter continues the same, for the “ elas- ficity of the fibres, circular in their direction, Qq202 of the middle coat,’' we are assured by Dr Jones, “ keeps a dead artery open and circular.’ In page 114, Dr. Jones, detailing the imme diate effects of wounds of arteries, as they re spect the form and appearance of such wounds tells us that “ the longitudinal appears to pro duce the slightest possible, or perhaps scarce ly any separation ; the oblique occasions a se paration proportioned to its extent; and tin transverse, however small, seems to produce c circular aperture in the parietes of the artery.’ And in note C, refers us to an opinion of Johr Bell, expressed on a case of Deschamp, which decides a principle. Have the circular fibres of the middle coat nc power or action ? When the circle is violated by the slit-like cut up and down the wall of the ar-* tery, what prevents the fibres of the middle coat from acting? Will they not retract and ga- ther up on themselves ? They have the same elasticity that the longitudinal fibres have. 1 am astonished at the facility with which Bel] has suffered himself to be led astray. With Dr, Jones there is more ample apology ; he is evi-j dently, from his writings, not a practical sur-; geon. Do we not see, too frequently, in unhap- py operations with the lancet in the common af- fair of abstracting blood from the arm, that in those slit-like wounds the lips do not remain in complete contact and apposition? In operating^903 on the basilick vein, if we penetrate so deep as to touch the artery, we for the most part make the incision pretty nearly parallel with the lon- gitudinal fibres of the humeral artery, descend- ing through the fold of the elbow, just before it divides into the ulnar and radial trunks. And yet who ever understood that such wounds would not open in obedience to the elastic pow- er of the circular fibres of the middle coat ? Is there no separation of the lips in those longitu- dinal cuts, when a new wave of blood is impel- led along, forcing the artery into a state of dia- stole ? Surely, my friend, hypothesis has some share in this grave doctrine. But to put all conjecture to rest, I have seen, and demonstrated, in a living artery, a longitu- dinal incision to the extent at least of half an inch: and in this the edges receded very con- siderably from each other, and exposed, in a great degree, the opposite internal surface, al- though the vessel was kept in an extended state, thus mechanically favouring the approximation of the edges, and counteracting the natural re- traction of the circular fibres. Six or eight med- ical gentlemen witnessed this. Were I not writing to Professor Smith, I would take into account, in my behalf, the opi- nion of Monro the father, in his great work, where he says, that if an artery be but slightly wounded, the edges instantly retract, and have204 an aperture as if an artist’s punch had passed through. But this error, as to the state of the lips of a longitudinal cut, in the parietes of an artery, so directly in the teeth of the anatomy and obvious physiology of the artery, is not the only thing of this quotation I have to notice. I have also to call your attention to the effects of a ligature thrown round an artery. The Doctor says, that “ if an artery be surrounded by a ligature, its middle and internal coats will be as completely divided by it as they can be by a knife, whilst the external coat remains entire.” If this po- sition, which the Doctor has dignified with the rank of a fact, is intended to convey to the mind of the reader the idea that this division of the ; internal and middle coats is the usual conse- quence of a ligature applied in the ordinary way by a surgeon, and it can have no other surgi- cal import, I am far from admitting it. It is, in my view, altogether gratuitous, and not de- ducible from any data furnished by the Doc- tor’s experiments. But I shall postpone all fur- ther consideration of this until I come to the ex- , periments instituted for its illustration. I now : advance to the experiments of the first chapter, j i CHAPTER I.—SECTION IT Experiment 1.—“ The haemorrhage did noi ; cfease (from the carotid of a horse) before its !205 death. The circular membrane surrounding the divided portions of artery was very much filled with blood; both extremities of the artery were considerably contracted^ particularly the one next to the head, but there was no coagulum,” &c. Experiment 2.—“The animal bled to death, &c. the truncated extremities of the artery had retracted about an inch and a quarter, and were very much contracted^ but their mouths were open ; the arterial sheath and cellular membrane were much distended with dtloodf &c. Experiment 3.—The cut extremities of the ar- tery v/ere separated nearly an inch; both ap- peared to be very much contracted; the surround^ ing cellular membrane and sheath were very much filled with bloodf &cc. « It were a waste of time to recapitulate in de- tail, all the particulars of the nineteen experi- ments of this second section. It may suffice to say that in each one, the above prominent facts were fully ascertained, viz. the contraction of the mouth of the divided extremity^ and injection of the cellular membrane^ surrounding the artery and sheath^ with coagulated blood and lymph, and the mutual recession of the ends of the separa- ted vessel. There can be no dispute about the retraction of the extremities of a divided artery, therefore I shall pass on to the other points.206‘ By every stroke of the heart a wave of blood is urged forward into the artery, by which the artery is dilated, or is forced into what is term- ed its diastole ; the elasticity of the tunicks of the artery being by this wave of blood called in- to operation, for the coats are put into a state of distention, restores the artery from this state of dilatation to its ordinary quiescent state, or condition of systole ; and in this condition of rest or systole it would continue, were it not a- gain altered by a succeeding wave of blood from the heart. In this play of systole and diastole consists the pulsation. It is necessary here not to mistake this sys- tole of the artery, this natural quiescent state, for what the Doctor calls the contraction; for if the artery were dead and dissected out of the body, and laid by itself on a table, it would re- tain this systolick condition. Elasticity is equal- ly the property of living or dead matter. The Doctor wishes to convey a far different idea to the mind of his reader; he is desirous to impress him with the persuasion that the artery acted on by some unexplained laws, or spontaneous causes, is, by way of provision against approach- ing ruin, able to contract, and really does con- tract the mouth of the severed extremity. The experiments imiformly present to us two points ; the one is the reduction of the diameter of the end of the artery, or what Dr. Jones terms207 the cmtvaction; the other is the infarction or injection of the cellular substance surround*' ing the artery. Now if this infarction or injec- tion of the circumjacent cellular substance is fully adequate to the explanation of the redac- tion of the diameter, or lumen of the artery, why should we be over tenacious of this contrac- tionP why should we so solicitously lookout for the support and maintenance of this child of the imagination ? When the arterial sheath is injected with blood, and the surrounding cellular membrane much filled with lymph, as the most pointed testimony of each experiment unequivocally es- tablishes, either this cellular membrane sur- rounding the vessel must be enlarged, forcing apart and displacing all the superincumbent fat and muscle, and causing the volume of the limb) if it be in an extremity, to be increased; or the parietes of the artery must be urged into small- er compass, viz. the diameter of the artery must be lessened. The arterial tube is empty, or if filled, it can only contain coagulated blood, a material soft, and yielding, and readily giving place to a force from without. Can rational, enlightened minds hesitate a moment about this alternative ? It is not more plain that two and two amount to four in com- mon arithmetic, than that if there be an inter- nal force of one thousand, operating against a208 connteracting force of five, the internal force still accumulating, that the counteracting force ol five must give way. From the nearest and best view I can take of the subject, I am convinced that the cellular membrane surrounding the artery is highly in- jected ; that the end of the cut artery is reduc- ed in its diameter; but this is done mechanical- ly, and not by any spontaneous contraction in the vessel itself; nor do I see any insurmount- able impediment to this conclusion, except it be the very respectable authority of Dr. Jones, who, with all the serious gravity imaginable, assures us, in the eighteenth experiment, that “there was a considerable layer of coagulated lymph, in which the artery was completely en- closed, but not compressed by it, although it was impossible to conceive a more complete engorge- ment of the cellular membranes surrounding it.’* And, to enforce with additional energy the doc- trine of the text, our author adds, in a foot note, “I make this observation because the state of this artery forms an insuperable objection to Pouteau’s doctrine, that the suppression of hte- morrhage depends on the engorgements of the cellular membrane.” Then the Doctor does ve- rily believe that, “ although the portion of ar- tery next to the head was so completely surroun- ded by coagulated lymph, that it was impossi- ble, from an external view of it, to say exactly where it terminated,” the whole force of this ac-S09 :umulated and accumulating lympk spent itself in displacing the superincumbent fat and mus- :les, and even putting the integuments them- selves on the stretch, without at all compress- ng the parietes of the artery ! Had Pouteau la- boured seven years he could not have hunted ap an experiment more to his purpose. And to vhat state of the artery Jones can possibly al- ude when he says it lorms an insuperable ob- ection to Pouteau’s doctrine, I cannot conjec- ure. If the subject were not the adjustment of m important point of science, I should believe the Doctor was sporting with the easy faith of his reader. I The conical state of the extremity of the di- vided artery we also deduce from this coagula- i:ed blood and lymph compressing the sides. W'hy it is conical is very obvious ; the coagu- lation immediately at the point is greater than It is higher, consequently the extreme end is :more diminished in its volume than farther on. In section the third of the same chapter. Dr. Hones proceeds to show that we are not only to ^expect, in the natural process for the suppress- ion of arterial ha3morrhage, a contraction of the ends of the vessel; but, in addition to this spon- taneous contraction, that we are uniformly to imeet with an external and internal coagulum of tblood, together with a coagulum of lymph in- terfused between those sanguineous coagula. 2 D210 No surgeon of any reading or observation cai licsitate to admit the existence of an txttriml ce agulum of blood; it is met with on every exam inaiion, and in every surgical writer. We can not open a fresh wound without seeing it. '1 h evidences however, of the uniform occurrenc' ^f an internal coagulum are not so great, and S( generaHy within the reach of our senses, nor ( that genuine, irrefragable sort which are to bi eollected from the faithful history of unadulte rated cases. ''I'he coagulated lymph, on w'hicl the Doctor lays so much stress, is certainly t( be found, but when he undertakes to show tha it serves as a coagulum, or stopple, to close U| the tube of the artery, he undoubtedly become: too mechanical in his idea; but more of thh presently. In conceding the presence of an external coa- gulum in the sheath, and attached to the mouth of every recently divided arter}-, provided the artery be not of the larger class, 1 must not be understood as granting also its permanent utili- ty, Its advantages are transient and illusory. By mechanically filling up the sheath left vacant by the retraction of the extremity of the vessel, and attaching itself, by means of the cohesive property of the coagulable lymph incorporated with it, to the end of the artery, it stops the hae- morrhage, but no sooner does this coagulum be- gin to liquify, and melt down, than this whole Tnechanical support gives way, and a new dash211 )f blood disquiets the patient, and alarms the icirgeon. I have seen this coagulation about the mouth )f the vessel, this suppression of hxmorrhage, ukI this hqaifaction and hilling away of the me- chanical transient support, agam and again oc- curring, and it will constantly overtake the steps )f the surgeon so long as he shall pursue the deviating track which keeps in sight the perma- nent aid of this external coagulum. I An internal coagulum of blood is not always CO be met with ; so rarely indeed does it occur, that many of the best and most experienced sur- geons have searched for it in vain, for it has been a moot point nearly an hundred years. Na- ture in her processes, whether acting by the co- operation of many means, or simple causes, is, and must be uniform: a thing that is contingent is not of the regular process of nature. White, in his cases, says, “I next laid open (the arteries to their extremities, and tound them entirely closed (sides completely in contact and «consolidated) near an inch froai the end of the stump ; but from that point upwards their capa^ cities were not at all diminishecU nor was there any coagulum or clot of blood in the vessels or any where near them.” Pouteau remarks, that he ‘‘ very seldom found any traces of internal coagulum \ that in four ex-212 aminalions, one of a stump of an arm eight days, after amputation; two of legs, one ten days, and the other three weeks after the operation ; and of a thigh four weeks after amputation, he found no coagulum.” It IS very extraordinary, if this internal coagu* lum be a part of the process of nature, that those two able and observing surgeons could discover nothing of it in those five or six cases. But Dr. Jones, anxious to break the force of these cases bearing so immediately on this disputable point, anticipates the conclusion of the reader, by re- minding him that artificial means were resorted to. It is true tljey were ; but will Dr. Jones, or any other gentleman for him, demonstrate that this artificial aid has prevented, or can prevent such a process, if it be a work of nature ? I confess that in this suggestion of the Doctor, there is, in my opinion, more of evasion and subterfuge, than argument. What can be the difference be- tween the subsequent operations of the extremi- ty of an artery when a ligature or compress is used, and when this extremity is compressed by a coagulation round the parietes, thereby forc- ing them into contact ? The external coagulum as readily forms in the artificial suppression as in the natural, and the effusion of the ly m ph IS the same; for the effusion of lymph and the external coagulation are totally independent of the mean^, whether natural or artificial, made213 use 6f for the suppression of the haemorrhage. The effusion of the lymph is produced by the excitement in the exhalents, caused by the dis- turbance in their economy by the cutting instru- ment, and the coagulation is a mere property of dead matter, for a time acting in the coagulable lymph or gelatine : and the effusion of lymph is uniform, internally as well as externally, but it is not seen after a few days, because it is part- ly taken up by the absorbents of the internal coat, and partly carried away by the circulating fluid. But to proceed. “ After he (a large horse, the subject of the experiment) was killed,’^ says Gooch, “ we dis- sected the thigh, and found that the bleeding was not suppressed by coagulated blood, but by the vessels being close contracted (their walls mechanically compressed) for near an inch or more from their extremities.” “ When hfemorrhage stops of its own accord,” adds John Bell, “ it is neither from the retrac- ;ion of an artery, nor the construction of the ifibres, nor the formation of clots, (internal coa- :^ula of Petit) but by the cellular substance, ■which surrounds the artery, being injected with Dlood ” Here Bell repeats to us the doctrine of Pouteau, which is firmly established by the experiments of Dr. Jones. On this opinion however, of John Bell, Dr. Jones indulges in the following criticism : “We214 have therefore only to discuss the difference be- tween a clot of blood and coagulated bloody to dis- cover the principal difference between this off- spring of Mr. Bell, and what he has been pleas- ed to call Petit’s sickly child.” From respect to Dr. Jones I would not say that he has willingly misrepresented Bell, but most unquestionably he has egregiously misun- derstood him. When Bell says, “• nor the for- mation of clots,” he, to the understanding of every man, plainly conveys the idea of the inters nal coagula of Petit, for against Petit’s doctrine he is contending, and cannot be supposed to have in his view the external coagulation or iiyection ; of the surrounding cellular membrane, wHich is the true and real cause of the suppression- Dr. ‘ Jones, in his next edition will, I hope, leave ? both his candour and understanding unincum- bered by suspicion. That there is now and then an internal coagu- J him, I admit to be probable, yet I cannot grant it to be any part of the process of nature for the suppression of an arterial hsemorrhage ; when it occurs, it can only be considered as a casualty, transient in its consequences, and of no perma- nent duration. On the division of an artery, there is, at first, a dash of blood, but, if the artery be small, the effusion gradually lessens until the blood pour- ed out shall coagulate, at first at a distan.ee, and215 by degrees it approaches the mouth of the ves- Sv 1, ancUi'ialiy closes its tube by bringing the sides into contact. The irritation occasioned by the wounding instrument, after a few hours, cau es the exhalents, both without and within the canal of the artery, to throw out an increas- ed quamity of lymph ; for the artery, in fact, inflames : the sides being compressed from with- out, are forced into contact and coaptated like the lips of a wound, a thin stratum or almost im- perceptible quantity of lymph is effused between the parietes of the vessel, through which fine ar- teries, with all the apparatus of organization, pass, mutually receive each other, or anasta- mose, and ultimately constitute a continuous or- :ganized substance. Thus do the living walls, by these intermediate vessels, become perma- nently united ; the blood circulates from side to side, and nature’s grand object is attained. But yet, like an artist who, when he has completed his building t Tes down his scaffolding, nature, by apparatus of her own, gradually removes this -effused lymph from the inside, from between ithe tunicks, and from without, and the whole lartery, down to the coalesced points, is restor- ted to its healthy natural appearance and condi- ition. The effused lymph serves merely as an appropriate bed for the tender vessels to generate in, and no sooner is the organization accomplish- ted than this now useless matter^ is carried away (by the industrious absorbents. Thus stood the 1 fact in the arteries dissected by myself, referred216 to in my former letter ; thus stood the fact in the cases of Pouteau ; and thus stood the fact with the accurate and observant White. Nor. in my opinion will the careful dissecter ever find it otherwise if he waits until the whole process of nature shall be gone through. As to inter- nal columns of blood or lymph either becoming in and of themselves organized, sending their vessels out to meet those of the sides, and ulti- mately constituting with the sides an organized living part of the animal system, it is a flight of imagination against which 1 seriously and warm- ly object, Whether the sides of an artery close by a sin- gle line, as was the case with my subject, or are united for half an inch or two inches, it matters not; in either case the union depends on the sides being more or less pressed into contact, and kept so by external agents, or the cohesive property of the lymph, until they shall firmly grow together. So far as respects partially divided or punctur- ed arteries, I delivered my sentiments in my for- mer letter, and in Dr. Jones I meet with noth- ing that alters in the slightest degree my opinion as you then received it. I am not conversant with the pathology of wounds in the arteries of the lower animals, but according to the success of the Doctor in brutes, the anatomy between their wounds and similar ones in the human kind217 must be very different; at least, if the testimo- nies of surgeons are to be received. In the third chapter, Jones treats of the im- mediate effects of the ligature, used I suppose in the ordinary way, of surgeons. He herein endeavours to show the direct consequences of the ligature to be a total separation of the inter- • nal and middle coats of the vessel. Early in his ' work he announced as a fact this consequence of the ligature, and this chapter is pretty much devoted to illustrate it by apposite experiments. The whole that I can gather from the most atten^ :tive perusal of the experiments is, that, when a ligature was applied round the vessel, and in a short time thereafter removed, there was found an effusion of lymph, sometimes in the form of a transverse septum cutting the upper from the lower part. These experiments, as they are detailed, are extremely inconclusive, and, to my mind, quite unsatisfactory. To them there are several things to object. We, in the first place, have to ascer- tain whether, in the application of the ligature to the artery of the brute, more force was not exerted than is ordinarily used by surgeons ; in the second place there was no demonstration that these coats were divided at all, it remains a thing of inference from the effusion of lymph ; and conceding, which we do not, that a separa- tion of the fine vessels necessarily preceded the 2 E219 efTusion, it does not follow that the immediate effects of the ligature was the division of the in- ternal and middle coats, for the ligature might mechanically so affect the susceptible constitu- ent parts of these lunicks as to induce inflamma- tion, gangrene, and sphacelus of the whole cir- cle within the loop, fcvery surgeon knows that the circle within the loop uniformly dies and falls away ; but this is a secondary operation, and does not take place until after the sides, imme- diately above the edge of the mortifying circle, have,united and become Arm. But, in the third place, my chief objection is, that when a ligature is applied, even but for a short time, the interruption to the circulation in the vasa vasorum of the internal and middle lu- nicks, and the bruising they receive, must ex- cite more or less of irritation, which quickly runs on to inflammation. In this state of excite- ment, innumerable facts assure us, that the ex- halents pour out a vast quantity of coagulable lymph. Nor is it requisite that the integrity of the fine vessels should be violated, either for the production of the lymph, or absolute union of the surfaces. We could instance the copious effusion of lymph, along the internal surface of the trachea, in cases of the croup ; also, in in- flammations of the pleura, the numerous occur- rences of a permanent union of the pleura cos- talis with the pleura pulmonalis ; and to these may be superadded the various attachments be-219 eween the several duplicatures of the peritoneum in cases of abdominal inflammation. The Doctor certainly would not argue that, because the lymph was effused, or because in- ternal surfaces coalesce, there necessarily must be a division of vessels or an ulceration of sur= faces. I now close my long, and, I am apprehensive, uninteresting letter. I have endeavoured to be plain and intelligible in all its parts : I have ob- jected to no opinion that I did not think serious- ly objectionable ; and I have in no place quoted Dr. Jones's sentiments, so as, by dissociating them from the general te^ct, to make them ap- pear to a disadvantage. I hate disputation, and I abhor a war of words. Baltimore^ October 27/ft, 1309.§§0 A review of Mease's case of Aneurism^ by J. B. bavidge^ M. Jb. MEDICAL cases, collected with assiduity, examined with intelligence, and promulgated with ingenuousness, are ample lessons of instruc- tion, but when they are permitted to be vehicles of erroLir, or channels affording facilities to un- dijested, hasty speculations, they call irresisti- bly on our attention, and rouse our vigilance; they should be scrutinized with rigour, yet with justice, and admitted with the extremest caution \ it becomes a duty to control their influence, and repress their extravagance. Were it so that they would fall into the hands of men of science and observation only, we should give ourselves but little concern about them, but as they are intended to convey, doctrines and principles, to minds incompetent to determine on their nature, it would amount to culpable dereliction of the duty we owe both the publick and our profession to let them pass unnoticed. In an especial man- ner are we bound to subject such cases, as are here alluded to, to strict and critical analysis, where they come forth clothed with the autho- rity of character, and enforced by the recom- mendation of that celebrity which already and deservedly possesses the publick confidence.221 Had the above case, to be found in the sixth number of the Philosophical Journal and Review of New-York, from the pen of f)r. Mease, been given to the world unaccompanied by the preface and concilia"'ion by Dr. Dorsey, it would have excited little interest and awakened less curiosi- ty. There is so much of common character about it; so much of what every professional man, at all in the habit of using the lancet, must frequently meet with, that it would have called forth few other sentiments than those of gratitude for the benevolent intentions of the re- jpectable author, and, perhaps, surprise at the ninuteness of a detail without the force of con- action or ornament of variety. Upon reading the prelude, on which the edi- ;or of the Journal in afoot-note, makes a judici- )us remark, we acknowledge we anticipated liomething curious and valuable ; such as, if it lid not illustrate what the writer wished to es- tablish, would at least have afforded entertain- nent to the practitioner and information to the )upil; but, in this our expectation, we were dis- ippointed. The first point, in the detail of the ■ase, deserving of remark, is “ The blood at rst appeared very dark, for I had been in high lealth.” That the blood when it first flows from a vein, ■ecently opened, should be very dark, may be ttributed to almost any circumstance rather292 than to high health. We presume the author means by very dark, unusually dark. The blood may be very (unusually) dark from any disease which may so affect the lungs in their function pi event the blood from being properly oxigehated ; or from the air being cut off from the lungs by submersion, or a cord round the neck. Contrary to what is the import and meaning of the writer’s language, the blood is never very, or in any eminent degree, dark, exclusively from high health. It is true it may be very dark when the arm has been bound up any considerable time before the vein be opened, although the persons have been in high health. And we are not a fittfe surprised that a gentle- man of the professional respectability of Dr. Mease, should have permitted an idea so unphU losophick to have escaped from his pen. In about ten or melve seconds it (the blood) changed to a florid complexion, and was dis- charged in jets.” From this the writer wishes it to be inferrec that the former quantity, the very dark, was from the vein, and the latter from the artery And to fortify this suggestion still more, he ii careful to mention that it was discharged in jets If a ligature be passed round the arm for i short time and then the vein be opened, th( blood first discharged will be dark in proportioi25S to the time the ligature was on previous to the opening of the vein ; if a be permitted to flow for a minute or two it becomes of a colour more or less florid ; and if the vein opened be the ba- silick, running immediately over the artery, the blood will be discharged in jets. Nor will those circumstances occur casually; they are almost always uniform. The blood is dark because it is detained in the veins of the arm, as it were out of the general drculation; it becomes of a florid complexion oecause there are fresh supplies round from the irteries ; and it is discharged in jets because the great artery in the fold of the arm is strongly- beating under the lower wall of the basilick vein. There is nothing in all this which can decisive- 'y point out the artery to be wounded, or should lave led a practical man to have suspected such in accident- “ I felt the pulsation of the blood, while flow- ng from the artery into the vein.” Of this, no doubt, the Doctor felt satisfied, lut he will excuse us, we hope, when we ac- mowledge that we can have no satisfactory eon- eption how, or in what way, he could deter- nine whether the pulsation he felt were of the >lood flowing from the artery into the vein, or rom the blood flowing along the channel of the urtery. beating against the blood effused from he vein. We may repeat, that to determine224 the pulsation felt to have been from the blood flowing from the artery into the vein, required more nicety and accuracy of toach, than in our^ estimatioii could have been boasted by any man, how well soever trained his sensation might have been ; and we are still disposed to propound the question : Is the pulsation of the blood while flowing from the artery into the vein obviously different from the pulsation of the blood while flowing in the tube of the artery ? and, If it be not indicated by some marked variety, might not the Doctor have been imposed on ? “ The pulsation of the blood,'' is an unusual expression. We understand the pulsation of an artery. Was there also a lube^ possessed of the properties of an artery, between d^e vein and artery ? If not there could not have been a pul- sation produced by the passage of the blood, up- on the supposition of a communication. “And perceived the thrilling noise from the same cause whenever I put my head under the bed-cloathes.” How strongly soever the Doctor was persuad- ed that he perceived a thrilling noise whenevei he put his head under the bed-clothes, we musi be indulged in the opinion that there was mort of imagination reality in the perception Fancy is sometimes extremely unruly, and at nc time more so, than when a man had becomt225 persuaded that the main artery of the arm was kvounded- Particularly when the subject of this supposed injury is a physician, well acquainted vvith the consequences of such a wound. Why could not the thrilling noise be heard ex- cept when the Doctor was in bed ? Is darkness •avourable to sound ? It is to the exercise of the magination. Or are vibrations propagated bet- ' ;er under the bed-clothes than in the open air of he room ? It does not appear that this thrilling loise was heard by either Dr. Physic or Dr. 'Dorsey. “ I was careful to use my arm as little as pos- iible, for besides the continuance there was a small swelling about the size of a_ small filbert m the injured part; but about five or sfx weeks ifter the accident I imprudently exercised it fo^ lalf an hour, when the part swelled to the size )f a common filbert, became painful and looked •ed. The pain and redness however soon sub- iided, but the swelling did not diminish for up- rvards of two months.” Now we have before us the plain and unadorn- ed fact; the simple description of an ecchymosis :ompounded with an inflamed and thickened ten- ion ; such as we have all met with so often that we have almost ceased to notice them. * In the genuine varicose aneurism, the blood oasses freely and uninterruptedly from the arte-' 2 F226 ry into the vein, especially so when a thrilling j noise can be heard. If then there be a liberal I and ready passage of the blood from the artery | into the vein, and afterwards an easy progress on through the vein to the heart, how could an increase of swelling, ^ redness and pain occur ? This pain, thi^reclness, this increase of swell- ing, argues-^^ry strongly, to our understanding, that thr^ase was an ecchymosis combined with inflammation and thickening of the circumjacent substance Indeed except there be a prompt and ready passage of the blood from the anery into the vein, the vein can never become va- ricose ; and if there be this ready passage of the blood we cannot understand how, at the distance of six weeks after the occurred, iTTflam- mation could take place; but that it did take place is obvious from the phenomena of redness, pain, and swelling. “ But, says the DoctoT, the swelling did not diminish for upwards of two months.** If the case were a genuine case of varicas® aneurism, what could cause the sxvdling to di- minish at all, until the aperture in the artery were closed ? The vein being once varicose, would continue to be so, and, indeed, increase in volume, so long as the blood should have free access to it from the artery. » “ Doctor Physick having carefully examined the arnij was perfectly convinced ol the existencevaricose aneurism, and did not entertain the Faintest hope of a spontaneous cure.” The opinions of Dr Physick are respectable, ind we are at all times gratified in paying regard ;o them ; but we are desirous it should be under- stood that the opinions of that gentleman, like .hose of every other gentleman of science and )hservation, must be considered as opinions, nere opinions^ and can by no means be substitut- 'd for facts And we are the more unwilling, n the present instance, to admit the substitution )f opinions for facts^ as we are informed that he able Physician referred to had not the faint- est hope of a spontaneous cure. That js, neither a\s reading or experience had ever furnished him with a spontaneous cure of a varicose aneu- rism, and conceiving this to be one, he had no ground on which he could bottom his hope. If neither the fair pages of surgical history, nor the honest experience of any judicious Sur- geon, can furnish a solitary case of a spontane- ous cure of a varicose aneurism, or indeed any other, without the obliteration of the diameter of the artery wounded, ouglit there not to be some little hesitation in making up a decisive Dpinion in the present case ? But even granting ^ that the artery was wounded, that it was an un- equivocal aneurism, what evidence has Dr. Dor- sey, from which he can reasonably or justly con^I 228 elude that the artery ever since has been per- vious.” ‘‘ At this time and ever since the cure, the ar, tery has been pervious, and pulsates like that in the other arm at the elbow and wrist.” In this concluding sentence Dr. Dorsey in- dulges himself in an unreserved expression of a positive opinion on a subject, respecting which he could have had no decisive or positive know- ledge. We will grant however to show more plainly the inconsiderateness of the Doctor’s con- clusion, that the artery was wounded, and that there has been a spontaneous cure. But does it follow as a necessary coris^^^^ee from a spon- taneous cure that the artery must be pervious ? There are numerous instances of spontaneous cures of aneurism on record, but in all there was an obliteration of the cavity of the artery. On the contrary there is no case where the wound in the wall of the artery has been closed by accident or by nature, leaving the artery'^er- H)ious, The lumen of an artery may be obliterated to ^ certain extent and yet, in consequence of the touch by the finger, being confused by the pul- sation of the artery above, and below the point of union or consolidation of the sides of the ar^ tery, no satisfactory or unexceptionable deduc- tion can be established.229 ' With regard to the pulsation at the wrist, on which some stress is laid, we hope it is unneces- sary for us to suggest, to the learned gentleman, that the perviousness of the main artery at the fold of the arm is by no means necessary. He well knows, as every surgeon must know, that an artery pulsates, when supplied by anastamos- ing branches, its trunk being tied or cut asun- der, as regularly and nearly or quite as forcibly, as when its diameter is tree and opeq through- cut. It appears to be forgotten that there was, and that too for a considerable time a compress on the tumour. What prevented the sides of the ~«trtery from being forced into contact by a. com- press continued for a series of days^ And if forc- ed into contact, what prevented a union ? But Dr. Dorsey decisively and unhesitating- ly avers that the artery is pervious. And by what sensible means has he ascertained this ^ know of but one mean, unequivocal and sa- tisfactory, by which this point can that is injection and dissection. Surely gentlemen must be very solicitous to sustain the notion that wounds in arteries can be cured spontaneously without a closing of their cavites, and that the surgeon need not trouble himself about the ligature or compress which we declare to be necessary in all wounded arteries*230 We will conclude the present remarks, with hinting to these gentlemen, and those who may tall in with their cases, that, if they do not oblite- rate the diameters of wounded arteries by com- press or ligature, the fate of their patients will re- main as sad memorials of the imperfect condition of the surgical art; and we will subjoin that we ex- ^^edingly regrc< because we highly respect Dr. Dorsey, that, withoutproof of any kind, or unequivocal evidence of any sort, or even pro^ bability, he has permitted himself to publish the following paragraph : he should have recollect- ed that a sufficient number of lives have alrea- dy been lost from wounded arteries left to “ heal without any obliteration of their cavity*’’ “ In compliance^ith*my promise, I have the pleasure to subjoin the case of aneurism which I considei>a decisive proof, that wounded arteries 7imy heal without an obliteration of their cavity. I lully concur with you in the opinion that such a termination is extremely rare ; but those wri- ters who pronounce the thing impossible, are surely mistaken” !! FINIS,N

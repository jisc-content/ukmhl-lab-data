6 not passed by in silence ; nor does the writer forget the suppositious Aneurism of Philadel- phia—that in which so much is said to suggest to a prudent understanding the advantage and propriety of always, vvith care, noting the mark- ed distance between opinion 'dndfact. The author intends to pursue his plan of fur- nishing sketches or out lines of correctives on certain errours of modern works ; and although his talents may not be fully adequate to a suc- cessful management of the vast mass of materi- als provided to his hand, he has some hopes arising from his industry and application. It is not to be understood that his hopes are very great of adding much to the fertility of the fair field of medical science, by directing through it many copious streams of knowledge from new and unexplored sources : he Vv^ill have the mea- sure of his expectations filled up, if he can suc- ceed in giving a proper diversion to the inundat- ing tide that has been for years setting in upon it. To act negatively is not at all times to act uselessly.—To be disabused of old errours is to be put into the way to acquire new truths.

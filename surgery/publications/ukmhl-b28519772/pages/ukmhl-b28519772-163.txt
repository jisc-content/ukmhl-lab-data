155 the man of the civilized v^orld has lost much of his original strength, â€œ the circular muscles, the heart and intestines, as far as we can determine, have lost nothing of their primitive powers. Now if the circulation, which depends on the heart, and the digestion, the office of the alimen- tary canal, be in the vigour they were in during the days of our first parents, the man of the ct- vilized world cannot have fallen off much. Where there is a vigorous circulation, and strong digestive powers, the muscular energies ot the body cannot be low. I allude to those muscular energies (I believe the long, straight muscles p be concerned) which qualify the Hibernian, in proud contempt, to poise his shilelah, the nervous Englishman to shake the very walls of the thea- tre of pugilism with loud huzzas, when he has pushed his unequal antagonist on some unresist- ing spot; which qualified the proud Roman to project the coit, or throw the javelin ; the alert Greek, covered with sweat and dust, to carry off the prize in the gymnastick circles ; or braw- ny American to turn, in coarse exultation, from his fallen competitor. The doctrine of the circular muscles is new; 1 am not prepared to receive or admit it. I be- lieve it to be wholly inadmissible, from our pre- sent anatomical knowledge, and social observa- tion.

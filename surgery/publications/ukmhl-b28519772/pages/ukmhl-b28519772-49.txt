We must now notice the egregious errour of Dr. Cullen in his philosophy on this point. If the other parts of the body, having acquried their tone and firmness, resist the force of the imping- ing blood, and determine it into the more lax and weak vessels of the womb, it could not happen that those parts already possessed of their pro- per figures and tone could acquire additional volume and power after the effusion of this fluid. But the fact is otherwise. For it is notorious that, almost uniformly, the whole body, subse- quent to the eruption of the menstrual fluid, does receive great increase of bulk, and, in most ca- ses, as to form, figure, and tone, does undergo great change. Therefore we cannot, when ma- turely considering these Tacts, assent to the o- pinion of Cullen, that this fluid is ascribable, in its cause, to any succession of evolution of the several parts of the body. We now turn our attention to the opinion of Charlton on this subject. He supposed that the menstruous fluid, in its causes, was attributable to a certain nitro-aerial spirit. His words are : â€œ howsoever the thing may be, I will not deter- mine, but it appears propable to me that a ni- tro-aerial spirit is the chief furnisher or setter forth in the work; therefore we shall consider it F

39 We will direct our attention to another hypo- thesis touching the subject. The menstrual operations have been conceived to depend on a congestion of blood in the uterine arteries. But the Physicians who have favoured this conjec- ture have not instructed us how it comes to pass that congestion accumulating by slow degrees into a considerable mass should burst forth at given intervals. And it may be received as an incontrovertible fact that every partial plethora, in any part of the body must in a short time be- come general. Therefore we shall speak some what at large on the general fulness held by al- most every physiologist as the unquestionable cause of the menstrual operation. Few indeed antecedent to the time of the eminent Cullen had so investigated this opinion of plethora as to throw any considerable light on the subject. And Cullen, although not deserted by his usual acumen, unsuccessfully essayed this difficult point having found it immersed in greatobscurity. Indeed we are permitted to grant this opinion of Cullen no higher rank than a hypothesis yet we most willingly acknowledge it to be an ex- ceedingly ingenious one. He lays it down as his premise that the uterus is the last part of the body which is evolved, and consequently that the blood sent out from the heart, being resisted by the superiour strength of the arte- ries of the other parts, is determined into the laxer vessels of the womb, and these gradually

84 observed that the fever in that state frequently • was attended by the black vomiting, he. He said that it was considered there as an endemick arising from the marshes, and in no instance contagious. It is true that Dr. Rush mentions an instance of this fever spreading in the country ; but we want graver authority than inaugural theses af- ford* Theses, we all know, generally, are nothing but the echo of the prelections of a pre- ceptor. In the flourishing and growing city of Balti- more, we have had the most stubborn, and irre- fragable proofs, of the yellow fever being inca- pable of supporting itself, in the cases which havepccured about the wharves and Fell’s Point. After those cases were reinpved up into the city, they had their virulence to die with them, those who died; and from those, who recovered, all mischief and supposed contagion evanesced into the empty air, \yhich bore it to the pages of medical writers, not to the bodies of healthy at- tendants, This was the result in 1794 and 1797, The unfortunate case, of the very respecta- ble Dr. E. Johnson, with several cotemporary incidents, afforded a short-lived triumph to those who were wedded to the contagious system ; but when their opinions, armed with all the ad- dress and subtlety of the authors, came in colli- sion, with those of more erect and manly aspect.

131 A most offensive smell was emitted from tins ves- sel after she had discharged her cargo, which was by persons several hundred feet from the wharf where she was moored. 4thlv A similar fever has been produced from similar cau- ses, Inâ€™^a variety of Instances : we shall briefly mention a few of them. At Tortola a fever was produced in the month of June, in the vear 1797, on board the ship Britannia, capt. James Welch, from the noxious air generated from a few bushels o potatoes, which destroyed the captain, mate, and most of the crew, in a few days. Two sailors were affected with a malignant fever, board ^he , capt. Thomas Egger, in the month of^March, 1727, from the noxious air produced by wine that had putri - ed in the hold of the ship, one of whom died soon after her arrival in Philadelphia. In the month of June, 1793, the yellow fever was genera- ted by the noxious air of some rotten bags of pepper on board a French Indiaman, which was carried into the port ot Bridgetown, by the British letter of iparque Pilgrim. All the white men and most of the negroes employed in removing this pepper, perished with the yellow fever and the foul atmosphere affected the town, where it proved fatal to many of the inha- bitants. On board the Busbridge Indiaman a yellow fever was pro- duced in the month of May, 1792, on her passage from England to Madras, which affected above two hundred of the crew, it was supposed to be derived from infection, but many qircum- stances concur to make it probable that it was derived from noxious air. The absence of smell in the air does not militate against this opinion, for there are many proofs of the most malignant fevers being brought on by airs which produced no impression on the sense of smelling. This is more frequent y the case when the impure air has passed a considerable distance from its source and becomes diluted with the purer air of t c atmosphere.

I have also to call your attention to the effects of a ligature thrown round an artery. The Doctor says, that “ if an artery be surrounded by a ligature, its middle and internal coats will be as completely divided by it as they can be by a knife, whilst the external coat remains entire.” If this po- sition, which the Doctor has dignified with the rank of a fact, is intended to convey to the mind of the reader the idea that this division of the ; internal and middle coats is the usual conse- quence of a ligature applied in the ordinary way by a surgeon, and it can have no other surgi- cal import, I am far from admitting it. It is, in my view, altogether gratuitous, and not de- ducible from any data furnished by the Doc- tor’s experiments. But I shall postpone all fur- ther consideration of this until I come to the ex- , periments instituted for its illustration. I now : advance to the experiments of the first chapter, j i CHAPTER I.—SECTION IT Experiment 1.—“ The haemorrhage did noi ; cfease (from the carotid of a horse) before its !

I 228 elude that the artery ever since has been per- vious.” ‘‘ At this time and ever since the cure, the ar, tery has been pervious, and pulsates like that in the other arm at the elbow and wrist.” In this concluding sentence Dr. Dorsey in- dulges himself in an unreserved expression of a positive opinion on a subject, respecting which he could have had no decisive or positive know- ledge. We will grant however to show more plainly the inconsiderateness of the Doctor’s con- clusion, that the artery was wounded, and that there has been a spontaneous cure. But does it follow as a necessary coris^^^^ee from a spon- taneous cure that the artery must be pervious ? There are numerous instances of spontaneous cures of aneurism on record, but in all there was an obliteration of the cavity of the artery. On the contrary there is no case where the wound in the wall of the artery has been closed by accident or by nature, leaving the artery'^er- H)ious, The lumen of an artery may be obliterated to ^ certain extent and yet, in consequence of the touch by the finger, being confused by the pul- sation of the artery above, and below the point of union or consolidation of the sides of the ar^ tery, no satisfactory or unexceptionable deduc- tion can be established.

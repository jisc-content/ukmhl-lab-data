208 connteracting force of five, the internal force still accumulating, that the counteracting force ol five must give way. From the nearest and best view I can take of the subject, I am convinced that the cellular membrane surrounding the artery is highly in- jected ; that the end of the cut artery is reduc- ed in its diameter; but this is done mechanical- ly, and not by any spontaneous contraction in the vessel itself; nor do I see any insurmount- able impediment to this conclusion, except it be the very respectable authority of Dr. Jones, who, with all the serious gravity imaginable, assures us, in the eighteenth experiment, that “there was a considerable layer of coagulated lymph, in which the artery was completely en- closed, but not compressed by it, although it was impossible to conceive a more complete engorge- ment of the cellular membranes surrounding it.’* And, to enforce with additional energy the doc- trine of the text, our author adds, in a foot note, “I make this observation because the state of this artery forms an insuperable objection to Pouteau’s doctrine, that the suppression of hte- morrhage depends on the engorgements of the cellular membrane.” Then the Doctor does ve- rily believe that, “ although the portion of ar- tery next to the head was so completely surroun- ded by coagulated lymph, that it was impossi- ble, from an external view of it, to say exactly where it terminated,” the whole force of this ac-

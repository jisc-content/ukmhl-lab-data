194 And after Joiin Bell had writen so ably and intelligibly about a plain fact, which, to be un- derstood, needed only to be pointed out, how could he suffer his trancendent pen to encumber itself with that mongrel, equivocal philosophy, that so unintelligibly discourses of “ the artery being eroded by the foul pus ?” The idea oi the sides of an artery being eroded by foul pus, is so far below that clear and luminous philoso- phy which so vividly shines through every pari of Bell’s great work—the greatest of surgical works—^that I can scarcely consent that it shall stand in the splendid copy I possess. Whatt more need he have said, than that the vessel was insulated, and without support ? Con sequently its walls must die, mortify, and fal away ; and thus would the blood burst out. Tc Bell we owe much in many things, especially for what he has written on the arteries. To wha he has said about the manner of managing the affair, I can add nothing. Baltimore^ July 25^/i, 1809-

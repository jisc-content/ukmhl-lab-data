110 the plates which are behind the eye-balls would unavoidably be forced in, and instant death be the result by the weight of the external air: Ihe columns of which, in weight amounts to about forty-pounds on each eye, allowing four- teen pounds to each square inch.* The poste- rior plate that supports the eye is frequently so thin as to be quite diaphanous. The inference is that either an inflammatory or partially con- gested state of the brain must give support to that delirium, vigilance, 8tc. we observe in the yellow fever and many other complaints. This recieves accession of certitude from the circumstances attending the decapitation of an animal; when the head of an animal is severed from its body, all the blood discharged is from the external parts of the head, not one drop es- capes from the internal. This is substantiated by the following experiments. Dissect the ves- sels to their exit from the skull, then secure them firmly by a ligature, this being done, di- vide the case and you will find every vessel re- gularly filled and replete with its contents hav- ing suffered no evacuation. Again, take a glass-globe with two opposite orifices, fill it with water, then put your finger upon one, and turn the other downwards; no water will escape until you remove your finger * Vide Hale*s experiments.

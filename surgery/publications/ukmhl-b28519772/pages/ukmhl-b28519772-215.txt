207 the cmtvaction; the other is the infarction or injection of the cellular substance surround*' ing the artery. Now if this infarction or injec- tion of the circumjacent cellular substance is fully adequate to the explanation of the redac- tion of the diameter, or lumen of the artery, why should we be over tenacious of this contrac- tionP why should we so solicitously lookout for the support and maintenance of this child of the imagination ? When the arterial sheath is injected with blood, and the surrounding cellular membrane much filled with lymph, as the most pointed testimony of each experiment unequivocally es- tablishes, either this cellular membrane sur- rounding the vessel must be enlarged, forcing apart and displacing all the superincumbent fat and muscle, and causing the volume of the limb) if it be in an extremity, to be increased; or the parietes of the artery must be urged into small- er compass, viz. the diameter of the artery must be lessened. The arterial tube is empty, or if filled, it can only contain coagulated blood, a material soft, and yielding, and readily giving place to a force from without. Can rational, enlightened minds hesitate a moment about this alternative ? It is not more plain that two and two amount to four in com- mon arithmetic, than that if there be an inter- nal force of one thousand, operating against a

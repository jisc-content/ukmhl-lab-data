It perpetually urg* cs the gravid uterus to recover upon itself, as the French would speak ; and no sooner do the throes, co-operating with the circular fibres of the fundus and corpus uteri, discharge the li- quor amnii, than the whole of the walls of the uterus, the circular fibres of the cervix, with those of the other parts, close about the child, and in this state would the hapless fcetus, im- mured within its narrow habitation, remain, un- til death and putrefaction should waste it away, were not the revival and reiteration of the throes to impel it to the v/orld. The circular fibres of the cervix are forced in- :o obedience by the superior power of the throes, of which I shall presently speak.

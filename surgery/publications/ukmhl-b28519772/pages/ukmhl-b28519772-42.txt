34 the virgin becomes more soft and winning, the uterus enlarges, the marks of puberty appear^ the bosom evolves, the countenance is more beautiful, the eyes sparkle, the step, the carri- age, the speech; in short all is grace and ele- gance. The time at which the menstruous action takes place is not the same in all. It varies ac- cording to climate, conditions of life, and varn ous other causes. Girls in the warmer regions are pubescent sooner, those in the colder later. The same is also true of the eruption of the menstrual fluid. This change is said to occur with the girls of Asia so early as during the eighth and ninth year; at which time they are women, and become mothers before they shall have completed their tenth year. But in the colder latitudes, this change does not occur un- til much later; nor indeed, except in very few instances, previous to the twentieth year. The periods at which the eruption takes place in different latitudes, do not differ more than the quantities discharged. In the very cold, about three ounces, in the very warm, to the extent of sixteen, are thrown off The quanti- ty bears relation to the latitude. In this climate, yiz. that of Britain, from six to eight ounces of blood are supposed to be the mean quantity discharged.

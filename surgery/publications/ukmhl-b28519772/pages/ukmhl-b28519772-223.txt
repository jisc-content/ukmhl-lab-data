215 by degrees it approaches the mouth of the ves- Sv 1, ancUi'ialiy closes its tube by bringing the sides into contact. The irritation occasioned by the wounding instrument, after a few hours, cau es the exhalents, both without and within the canal of the artery, to throw out an increas- ed quamity of lymph ; for the artery, in fact, inflames : the sides being compressed from with- out, are forced into contact and coaptated like the lips of a wound, a thin stratum or almost im- perceptible quantity of lymph is effused between the parietes of the vessel, through which fine ar- teries, with all the apparatus of organization, pass, mutually receive each other, or anasta- mose, and ultimately constitute a continuous or- :ganized substance. Thus do the living walls, by these intermediate vessels, become perma- nently united ; the blood circulates from side to side, and natureâ€™s grand object is attained. But yet, like an artist who, when he has completed his building t Tes down his scaffolding, nature, by apparatus of her own, gradually removes this -effused lymph from the inside, from between ithe tunicks, and from without, and the whole lartery, down to the coalesced points, is restor- ted to its healthy natural appearance and condi- ition. The effused lymph serves merely as an appropriate bed for the tender vessels to generate in, and no sooner is the organization accomplish- ted than this now useless matter^ is carried away (by the industrious absorbents. Thus stood the 1 fact in the arteries dissected by myself, referred

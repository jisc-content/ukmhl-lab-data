65 common air. Its decomposition is affected by the matter of heat inserting itself between the liquid pherules until their separation is such as to annihilate the attraction of combination be- tween the hydrogene and oxygene. In effecting this decomposition, however, there must be a third agent. Whether then an union, betwixt the oxigene and light, comes to pass, remains to be discovered : this I strongly suspect. The hydrogene being disengaged and insulated, and very much accumulated, or peculiarly combin- ed, with some subtle poison, perhaps becomes the peccant agent. It is worthy of observation that the bilious, or yellow fever does not generally prevail du- ring the heat of the summer. This may be ow- ing to the greatness of the heat dissipating and scattering the hydrogene, or marsh effluvia, so as to enfeeble and render it or those innocent. That a combination between the oxygene and light happens is likely, first from their natural affinity to each other, and secondly from a phce- nomenon observable during ignition. The rays of light falling immediately upon the ignited combustibles, cause the flame to become faint, and ultimately will extinguish every particle of ' the fire. The probability is, that this phcenom- enon is occasioned by the rays of light attract- ing and combining with the oxygene of the at- mosphere, and thereby interrupting the process I

159 iatation easy.” He does not restrict us to any given quantity. There is, however, but one thing to be understood. The bleeding is to be “ ^ propos suited to the circumstances of the case, as to extent, and done in time. What rea- sonable man could have said more ? In the same strain, we observe the opinions of Denman to run on “ fever and local inflam- mation*^ frigidity with inflammation). This ex- cellent accoucheur says, that “ It does not seem necessary to bleed every patient on the accession of labour, and for some it would be highly im- proper. But whenever the feverish symptoms become violent, it (blood-letting) is, I believe, universally proper ; the quantity cf blood taken away, being suited to the degree of fever, and to the constitution of the patient.”^ If the fever arises from local inflammation, as we understand from the head of the section, and as there must be pain where there is local inflammation pro- ducing fever, he assuredly prescribed blood-let- ting “ for the diminishing of pain.’* A little farther on, a few pages only, the same judicious man adds: “For the prevention of such difficulties as may attend the first act of parturition, in those who are advanced in age, we have been advised to order frequent and small bleeding towards the conclusion of pregnancy.” *'■' Denman, Vol. II, p. 50, 59.

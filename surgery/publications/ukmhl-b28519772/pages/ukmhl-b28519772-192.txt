184 seen matters proceed, for two and three weeks, until the hand, wrist, and fore-arm have been completely injected, and the patient exhausted to the extremest degree. And what does all thi^ arise from ? From one of three things. The surgeon has read, or heard, for all ouij surgeons do not read, that if the lips of th^ wound in an artery be coaptated, whether b)i good luck or artificial means, they will unite afj ter the manner of a vein, the gluten being pour] cd out by the vasa vasorum. Or, if the arter)i be completely divided, it will contract up to it^ first branch. Or, a coagulum without and with- in, will form, and serve as a stopple to the arte- ry. And in this last, countenanced by the doc^ trine of the vitality of the blood, he begins t3 imagine to himself, or talk to those about him. how this coagulum forms its new vessels, andl how they stretch out towards the walls of the artery, and how, by uniting with the sides, thq plug is secured. Here are three sources of er-< ror in the surgeon, and danger to the patient. I hold it as an axiom in the surgery of a woundn ed artery, that no hsemorrhagy from an artery will cease, except the sides come into close con4 tact and union. In the smaller arteries, I conceive, that, byj the effused and coagulated blood without andj about the sheath of an artery, its sides are forcH cd into union j that is, that they come into con*-

§§0 A review of Mease's case of Aneurism^ by J. B. bavidge^ M. Jb. MEDICAL cases, collected with assiduity, examined with intelligence, and promulgated with ingenuousness, are ample lessons of instruc- tion, but when they are permitted to be vehicles of erroLir, or channels affording facilities to un- dijested, hasty speculations, they call irresisti- bly on our attention, and rouse our vigilance; they should be scrutinized with rigour, yet with justice, and admitted with the extremest caution \ it becomes a duty to control their influence, and repress their extravagance. Were it so that they would fall into the hands of men of science and observation only, we should give ourselves but little concern about them, but as they are intended to convey, doctrines and principles, to minds incompetent to determine on their nature, it would amount to culpable dereliction of the duty we owe both the publick and our profession to let them pass unnoticed. In an especial man- ner are we bound to subject such cases, as are here alluded to, to strict and critical analysis, where they come forth clothed with the autho- rity of character, and enforced by the recom- mendation of that celebrity which already and deservedly possesses the publick confidence.

199 The substance of which atteries are com* posed is divided into distinct parts,” says the Doctor, “ which have been called tunicks or coats* Three coats, which have received vari- ous names, can be readily demonstrated, and may be simply and clearly distinguished by the terms, internal, middle, and external. “ The internal coat, although extremely thin, is very close in its texture, and gives to an arte- ry a smooth and polished lining; it is elastick and firm, considering its delicate structure, in the longitudinal direction, but so weak in the circular as to be very easily torn by the slight- est force applied in that direction. The morbid changes which have been observed in it, prove that this coat is vascular, and some experiments have been related to show the probability of its being sensible. “ The middle coat, which is thickest, is form- ed by numerous layers of firm, compact, fleshy fibres, of a pale red colour, passing in a circu- ar direction, but appearing rather obliquely con- nected and interlain with each other, than form- ! ng complete circles. These fibres are of a pe- culiar nature, are well supplied with nerves, and resemble, in form and disposition, muscular fi- bres, but differ from them in possessing a re- markable degree of elasticity. Their elasticity iceeps a dead artery open and circular ; for this coat, when detached from the internal and ex-

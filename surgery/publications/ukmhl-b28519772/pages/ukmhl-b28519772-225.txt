217 must be very different; at least, if the testimo- nies of surgeons are to be received. In the third chapter, Jones treats of the im- mediate effects of the ligature, used I suppose in the ordinary way, of surgeons. He herein endeavours to show the direct consequences of the ligature to be a total separation of the inter- â€¢ nal and middle coats of the vessel. Early in his ' work he announced as a fact this consequence of the ligature, and this chapter is pretty much devoted to illustrate it by apposite experiments. The whole that I can gather from the most atten^ :tive perusal of the experiments is, that, when a ligature was applied round the vessel, and in a short time thereafter removed, there was found an effusion of lymph, sometimes in the form of a transverse septum cutting the upper from the lower part. These experiments, as they are detailed, are extremely inconclusive, and, to my mind, quite unsatisfactory. To them there are several things to object. We, in the first place, have to ascer- tain whether, in the application of the ligature to the artery of the brute, more force was not exerted than is ordinarily used by surgeons ; in the second place there was no demonstration that these coats were divided at all, it remains a thing of inference from the effusion of lymph ; and conceding, which we do not, that a separa- tion of the fine vessels necessarily preceded the 2 E

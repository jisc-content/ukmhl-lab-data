135 obliged, by law to cairy and use a ventilator, and we recom- mend in a particular manner the one lately contrived by Mr. Benjamin SVynkoop.—We believe this inv'^cntioa to be one of the most important and useful that has been made in modern times, and that it is calcutated to prevent not only the decay of ships and cargoes, but a very frequent source of pestilential diseases of all kinds in commercial cities. In thus deciding upon the nature and origin of our late fever we expect to administer consolation to our fellow citizens up- on the cause of our late calamity, for in pointing out its origin to the senses, we are enabled immediately and certainly to pre- vent it. But while the only source of it is believed to be from i abroad and while its entrance into our city is believed to be in ways^ so numerous and insidious as to elude the utmost possi- ble vigilance of health officers,, we are led in despair to consi- der the disease as removed beyond the prevention of human power or wisdom. It has been by adopting measures similar to those we have delivered for preventing pestilential diseases, tnat most of the cities of Europe, which are situated in warm latitudes, have become healthy in warm seasons and amidst the closest commercial intercouse with nations and islands .const^tly afflicted with those diseases. The extraordinary cleanliness of the Hollanders, was originally imposed upon pestilential fevers in their cities. Ihis habit of cleanliness has continued to characterize those fieople after the causes which produced it have probably ceas- ed to be known. In thus urging a regard to the domestick sources of the yel- eow fever, we are actuated by motives of magnitude, far beyond f hose which determine ordinary questions in science. Though s veteel the strongest conviction that the value of property, the ncrease of commerce and general prosperity of our city, will *e eminently forwarded by the adoption of the foregoing propo- itions, yet these are but little objects in our view when com- .ared with the prevention of the immense mass of distress |/mch never tails to accompany a mortal epidemick. We con- ‘ der ourselves morever as deciding upon a question, which is

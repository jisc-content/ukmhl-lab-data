229 ' With regard to the pulsation at the wrist, on which some stress is laid, we hope it is unneces- sary for us to suggest, to the learned gentleman, that the perviousness of the main artery at the fold of the arm is by no means necessary. He well knows, as every surgeon must know, that an artery pulsates, when supplied by anastamos- ing branches, its trunk being tied or cut asun- der, as regularly and nearly or quite as forcibly, as when its diameter is tree and opeq through- cut. It appears to be forgotten that there was, and that too for a considerable time a compress on the tumour. What prevented the sides of the ~Â«trtery from being forced into contact by a. com- press continued for a series of days^ And if forc- ed into contact, what prevented a union ? But Dr. Dorsey decisively and unhesitating- ly avers that the artery is pervious. And by what sensible means has he ascertained this ^ know of but one mean, unequivocal and sa- tisfactory, by which this point can that is injection and dissection. Surely gentlemen must be very solicitous to sustain the notion that wounds in arteries can be cured spontaneously without a closing of their cavites, and that the surgeon need not trouble himself about the ligature or compress which we declare to be necessary in all wounded arteries*

55 young of the lower animals have no such re- sources ? we need not be at much trouble to fur- nish the reason they have not looked out and ex- plored the real and true cause of the menstrual operation. Certain authors have believed the menstru- ous flood to be offensive and hurtful. In the Livitical law some commands are to be found on this head. But, as the thing appears to me, more on account of the uncleanliness of that peo- ple, than from a regard to any thing unclean or hurtful in the fluid itself. We therefore must, according to my concep- tions, consider that nature in furnishing the menstruous fluid intends nothing farther than to present to us certain signs of the maturity of the uterine system. From this view we may explain why it is that the discharge ceases du- ring pregnancy ; that is because at this period the ovaries lose their capacity to be impregnat- ed which serves to rouse the arteries. Hence it is that we never, except in a few instances and these cases of disease, find this discharge to continue while the woman is pregnant. Before I come to a final close, I must pre- sent my thanks, grateful and sincere, to my friend and colleague Dr, John Shaaff*, and to others, from whom I have received acts of friendship, for the many favours and civilities enjoyed by their courtesy.

230 We will conclude the present remarks, with hinting to these gentlemen, and those who may tall in with their cases, that, if they do not oblite- rate the diameters of wounded arteries by com- press or ligature, the fate of their patients will re- main as sad memorials of the imperfect condition of the surgical art; and we will subjoin that we ex- ^^edingly regrc< because we highly respect Dr. Dorsey, that, withoutproof of any kind, or unequivocal evidence of any sort, or even pro^ bability, he has permitted himself to publish the following paragraph : he should have recollect- ed that a sufficient number of lives have alrea- dy been lost from wounded arteries left to “ heal without any obliteration of their cavity*’’ “ In compliance^ith*my promise, I have the pleasure to subjoin the case of aneurism which I considei>a decisive proof, that wounded arteries 7imy heal without an obliteration of their cavity. I lully concur with you in the opinion that such a termination is extremely rare ; but those wri- ters who pronounce the thing impossible, are surely mistaken” !! FINIS,

206â€˜ By every stroke of the heart a wave of blood is urged forward into the artery, by which the artery is dilated, or is forced into what is term- ed its diastole ; the elasticity of the tunicks of the artery being by this wave of blood called in- to operation, for the coats are put into a state of distention, restores the artery from this state of dilatation to its ordinary quiescent state, or condition of systole ; and in this condition of rest or systole it would continue, were it not a- gain altered by a succeeding wave of blood from the heart. In this play of systole and diastole consists the pulsation. It is necessary here not to mistake this sys- tole of the artery, this natural quiescent state, for what the Doctor calls the contraction; for if the artery were dead and dissected out of the body, and laid by itself on a table, it would re- tain this systolick condition. Elasticity is equal- ly the property of living or dead matter. The Doctor wishes to convey a far different idea to the mind of his reader; he is desirous to impress him with the persuasion that the artery acted on by some unexplained laws, or spontaneous causes, is, by way of provision against approach- ing ruin, able to contract, and really does con- tract the mouth of the severed extremity. The experiments imiformly present to us two points ; the one is the reduction of the diameter of the end of the artery, or what Dr. Jones terms

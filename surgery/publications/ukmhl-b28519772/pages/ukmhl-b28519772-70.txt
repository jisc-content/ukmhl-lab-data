The reader will bear in mind that the follow- ing few imperfect pages constitute the first en. ghsh production in which the author’s pen was ever engaged*: that he was not at liberty, to imagine himself employed in merely dressing a brilliant period of polite literature, or polishing a trope in rhetorick, but seriously occupied in disquisitions of a much higher, and a more im» portant nature; and also recollect, that, it was written a few months after the author had taken on himself the discharge of the highly respon- sible duties of his profession. Keeping in sight those points, the Reader, it is hoped, will gene- rously touch with a light hand, and view with a pardoning eye, the many inaccuracies and the juvenility oiP the style. * It was first published in 1798.

It is therefore my intention to treat of both these opinions at the same time; especially as almost all the attempts of Physicians, some before the days of Cullen, have tended to prove the position of the general fulness of the body being the cause. The opinion of Cullen is ingenious. He af« firms the effusion to be referrible to a given den- sity and tone of the arteries of the general body, which determine the blood in upon the womb, the arteries of the evolved uterus, laxer and wea- ker than those of the body in general, yield and, ultimately giving way, a hemorrhage is the re- sult. In the space of a month another conges- tion is established, and a second effusion takes place, and so on as with other hemorrhages: thus the menstruous flux, in its recurrences, be- comes established by habit i Yet Cullen has not ascertained to us how it is that this flux recurs so precisely at the end of every month in every healthy female body, in the same climate, nor indeed is it proven by him that any hemorrhage does return at fixed periods with undeviating precision. ^ We will admit, for thfe illustration of the thing ‘'tat the qiianiitv of eight ounces is accumulated

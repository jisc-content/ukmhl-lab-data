I allude to the frequent recurrence ot hsemorrh- age after the operation, for the popliteal aneu- rism, when the operation is performed in the front of the thigh. There is nothing in the na- ture of a femoral artery aneurismal in the ham, which should make it subject to hsemorrhagy. 'The fault, without doubt, must be solely in the manner of securing the vessel. I need not en- ter minutely into detail of the various methods of doing this plain affair—the ligatures of reserve "“■the metallick plates—the modes of confining oops, he. They all tend more or less to break jp the connections of the vessel with the sur- rounding parts. They deprive it of nourishment, oy cutting off its channels of support. The ve- ;y solicitude to secure the vessel, together with its being left continuous and undivided, has i>een the source, of all the evil. What could be requisite to produce hsemorrh- ggy in an artery, more than to have it insulated —cut off from all the neighbouring parts—bed- ied in pus and coagulated blood ? Surely nothing, ^ow could its private ceconomy be maintained, > vhen the very instruments of support were de- t.troyed, when the blood could qo longer flow to ts bare and exposed walls ? 2 B

But Dr. Jones, anxious to break the force of these cases bearing so immediately on this disputable point, anticipates the conclusion of the reader, by re- minding him that artificial means were resorted to. It is true tljey were ; but will Dr. Jones, or any other gentleman for him, demonstrate that this artificial aid has prevented, or can prevent such a process, if it be a work of nature ?

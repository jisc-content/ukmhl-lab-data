INTRODUCTION. IT is not my intention in the following pages, 10 unfurl the banners of personal opposition. Dr. Rush professes truth to be the object of his inquiries—-truth is the end of my researches. The expanded mind of Dr. Rush, receives more sincere and real pleasure in the perception of one truth, than in all the fulsome incense that could ascend from a thousand flatteries: His great mind, I hope, is closed to the poisonous nutriment of boyish vanity. The object of my labours and studies, for several years past, has been, in a great mea- sure, an inquiry into the nature and etiology of diseases. And although, not unfrequently, I could meet with the opinion, that contagious diseases did often originate in marsh exhalations, yet as this opinion was accompanied by suspi- cious circumstances and wanted the support of probability, I treked it more as the fondness for novelty and innovation, than as the candid result of experience. Nor should I at present attempt to arrest its prevalence, had it not found too able an abettor in the learned and elegant Rush. Writers, of little note, cannot give tone to opin« .'Ons.

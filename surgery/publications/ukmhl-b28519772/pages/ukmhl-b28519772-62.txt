54 OJ the end or ultimate purpose oj the Menstruouo Fluid. lo this clay it remains a question, to what purposes this fluid is destined- Many believe that it is intended for the nutriment of the child. There were of the ancients as well as the mo- derns who countenanced this opinion, and for the reason that during gestation the menstruous fluid is discontinued, and was detained, as was imagined, as aliment to the embryon. For some time subsequent to conception the fetus does not exceed, in volume, a bean or a wasp. And during this time can require but a small quantity of nourishment. What now be- comes of the superfluous quantity ? If the men- struous fluid be intended for this purpose, in the earlier stage of gestation it woulcl be too abun- dant ; in the later insufficient.^ Added to this there are animals not provided with this fluid, but yet their young do not want aliment. Why therefore would writers look to this as nourish- ment for the child when it is obvious that the * The whole of the menstruous fluid for nine months, the term'of gestation, would not amount to more than five or at most six pounds; a child, at full time, together with the se- cundine, weighs from eight to ten or twelve, or fifteen, or ev- en twenty pounds. Hence it is irrefutable that the menstruous fluid cannot be intended for fetal organization. Nature could not act upon principles so inadequate, as to have her means thus incommensurate to her ends.

According to its structure, as above develop- 'd, if an artery be wounded transversely, the dges of the wound recede to a certain distance rom each other ; if it be wounded longitudinal- y, the lips of the incision in the same manner, or the fibres of the middle coat are nearly cir- ular, retire from each other, leaving a longi- aidinal chasm ; and if an artery be completely divided in its transverse direction, the extremi- ies retract, the one towards the breast, the i>ther from it, to a considerable distance ; but fie diameter continues the same, for the “ elas- ficity of the fibres, circular in their direction, Qq

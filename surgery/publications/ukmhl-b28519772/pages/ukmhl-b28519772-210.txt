Have the circular fibres of the middle coat nc power or action ? When the circle is violated by the slit-like cut up and down the wall of the ar-* tery, what prevents the fibres of the middle coat from acting? Will they not retract and ga- ther up on themselves ? They have the same elasticity that the longitudinal fibres have. 1 am astonished at the facility with which Bel] has suffered himself to be led astray. With Dr, Jones there is more ample apology ; he is evi-j dently, from his writings, not a practical sur-; geon. Do we not see, too frequently, in unhap- py operations with the lancet in the common af- fair of abstracting blood from the arm, that in those slit-like wounds the lips do not remain in complete contact and apposition?

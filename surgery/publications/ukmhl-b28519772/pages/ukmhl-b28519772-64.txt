o6 Th’ inhabitaiiits oi seas and skies sliall change, And fish on shore, and stags in air shall range The banish’d Parthian dwell on Arab’s lirink, And the blue German shall the Tigris drink : Ere I, forsaking gratitude and truth, Forget their kindness to my rising youth. When the author presented to, and sustain- ed before the University of Glasgow, as his Inaugural Thesis, the foregoing little work, he contemplated adding to it a short account of his views of the office of the Placenta: but finding himself anticipated by the learned professor Jaffrey, who, he understood, had employed his able pen on that subject, he abandoned his in- tentions. Yet it may not, even at the present moment, be out of place to state briefly the o- pinion entertained at that period*, and which he now, after much examination and reflection, believes to be well founded. 'Fhe Placenta has generally been thought to be a mere medium of connexion, or of circula- tion between the mother and child. To this the author has many, and, as he apprehends, serious objections to olfer. But passing by, for the present, all laboured discussion, he will on- Iv state that, to his views, the Placenta holds the rank and performs the office of a secretory organ, a species of Mamma, and that its function is the secretion and separation from the mother’s blood, of the aliment and oxygen necessary and appropriate to the fetal wants and demands. * 1793.

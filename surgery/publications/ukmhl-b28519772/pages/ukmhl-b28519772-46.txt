38 A few words may suffice to set aside the con- jecture of the menstrual operation being attribu- table to lunar influence. If the moon ruled, in this affair, it is presumable that all women would be under the operation at the same moment. This is not the fact. For at every period of a lunation some one or other is under this opera- tion. Therefore this visionary notion of Dr. Meed is to be rejected both as unscientifick and futile. We would ask, on this head, why does not the menstrual action take place before four- teen or fifteen or why does it cease after fifty years, seeing that the female is during the whole of life equally exposed to lunar power ? Here, as it appears to me, we have a striking illustra- tion of the greater disposition to indulge in ab- surd and ridiculous conceits than to engage se- riously in the sober investigation of the real na- ture of things. But other Physiologists, keeping void of one errour, have fallen on its opposite; desirous of avoiding Scylla, they have been wrecked on Charybdis. The opinion advanced by certain gentlemen that the menstruous operation derives its origin from too great a quantity or a peculiar quality of the bile rest upon ground as untena' ble and precarious as the sentiment noticed above. And to say more to demonstrate the in- correctness of those opinions would certainly be a waste of words.

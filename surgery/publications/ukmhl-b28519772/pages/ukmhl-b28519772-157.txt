149 the sentence is unsusceptible of any other inter- pretation. It leaves no room for his brilliant dis- covery of the passage of the second ovum, incase of superfcetation, along the fallopian tube ; its se- oaration of the membrana decidua from the pari- otes of the uterus, and getting within this hollow viscus. Of all the discoveries in the mystery of generation, this is by far the most splendid '« An embryon, with its water and involucra, the whole not equiponderant with two grains, forci- oly breaking up the attachment of the membra- :ia decidua, and making for itself room in the cavity of the uterus ! Does this embryon force ts way by mechanical powers, or melt down the )and of attachment between the lining membrane ind wall of the uterus, by certain chemical pro- perties ? The sentence in itself is a handsome display i)f the ability Avith which some gentlemen are fa- voured, of making a pretty arrangement of words, * “ This resistence will, however, be soon overcome ; either )y the ordinary efforts of the tube, or by the ovum resting un- i'lsually long, and beginning to develope, obliging the mouth of ihe tube to open,” &c. Museutriy V. 1, No. 2, p. 172. What efforts are these, that can overcome the resistence of- fered by the attachment of the lining membrane of the gravid iterus ? The more the ovum developes, the less the probability rf a passage through the mouth of the tube. The ovum, under these circumstances, must remain in the tube, and constitute an extra-uterine foetus. Perhaps the ovum would travel into the : Iterus, as Dr. Harrison’s semen would travel out of it. See Museum’) V. I, No. I, p« 39.

93 Our interest and commerce fall a sacrifice, and are immolated at the shrine of our folly. long as my reminiscence will recover to me a knowledge of the proceedings of therhealth-com- mittee of the city of Baltimore, L shall: admire and esteem their judgment and good, sense. ^ Has the yellow fever ever been imported, from the West-Indies to America ? Report says it hasi; but where are proofs ? smothered in impenetra- ble obscurity; they fiy the presence and con- verse of investigation. Has this fever ever been carried from the West-Indies to Britain ?t * This, with several other passages refer to the circumstan* ces of the time, and cannot be understood but by those who may be possessed of a knowledge of those circumstances. t On this subject Dr. Wilson in his valuable work on febrile diseases, has furnished us with a most important fact. Dr. Lind, remarks he, mentions a fact, for which it is still more difficult to account, that the same fever brought into this coun/ try in several American ships, attacked those only nvho had been, on board the shifts, others remaining uninfected, notwithstand- ing the freest intercourse with the sick on shore." Vol. 1, page IT'S. , It is not a little surprising that a man of understanding and science should be at a loss to account for this fact. If we were to admit the ships to be foul and highly charged with putrid ve- getable effluvia, might we not thereby be provided with a clue to the explanation of this mystery ? The persons who went on board the ships came into contact with the poisonous effluvia which at first produced the disease j those who remained on shore were exposed only to the human effluvia issuing from the sick and the dying- The conclusion here is inevitable ; the disease does not spread hy contagion, but is produced by putrid vegetable matter only.

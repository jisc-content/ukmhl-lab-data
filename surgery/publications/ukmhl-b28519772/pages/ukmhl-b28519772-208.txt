200 ternal coats, still preserves the cylindrical form, whilst they, on the contrary, in a state of sepa- ration, become flaccid, and collapse. As this coat has no longitudinal fibres, the circular fibres are held together by a slender connection, which yields readily to any force applied in the circum-' ference of the artery. The middle coat is inti-j mately connected with the internal and external| by a very short and fine cellular membrane. â€œ The external coat, anatomically considered,| is so simple, that many authors have thought] it sufficient to say, that it is formed of condens-J ed cellular membrane, which, by becoming gra-| dually of a looser texture, connects the artery with the surrounding parts ; but the importancd which is attached, in a surgical view, to thid coat, render!^ a more particular account of ii highly necessary and interesting. Although ul- timately resolvable into cellular membrane, yei it derives from the particular arrangement of it^ component fibres, a characteristick appearance which distinguishes it from cellular membrane and entitles it to be ranked as a proper coat of ar artery* Internally, or next to the middle coat its texture is close and smooth ; externally, mor< open and rough, in consec[uence of the cellula membrane by which it is connected with an ad ditional covering. The whole is remarkable fo its whiteness, density, and great elasticity. ^ ujn cLVtevy be suwounded by a ligatuve^ its middl and internal coats will be as completely divided h\

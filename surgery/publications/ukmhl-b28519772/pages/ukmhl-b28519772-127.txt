119 either generally or partially applied. I have seen the ephidrosis produced to that extent by a liberal use of calomel, as to require three or four changes of linen in twenty four hours. Calomel not only cures by acting as a diapho- retick and antiphlogistick, but also by establish ing in the system an opposite action to that of the fever. No two general actions can exist at the same time : So that when the mercurial ac- tion takes place the morbid one must, of necessi- ty. cease. The establishment of this mercurial action is confirmed to the practitioner by a free ptyalism. Whenever a free salivation takes place the patient is safe. Perhaps no person ever died after the full establishment of this discharge from the gums. Not that the salivation, strict- ly speaking, is of any service in itself. It is in the yellow fever, as in the lues venerea, the un- avoidable consequence of the general mercurial action of the system, and of no farther service than informing the physician of this general ac- tion. That the local pain is of no advantage is evi- dent from the following. Let the gums become ever so much inflamed, pained, and swollen, if a very free spitting should not succeed, the sick reaps no advantage, but, on the contrary this state of the gums is ominous of approaching death.

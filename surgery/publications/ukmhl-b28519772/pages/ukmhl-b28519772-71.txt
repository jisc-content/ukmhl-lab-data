TREATISE, &c. CHAPTER I. THE origin‘s history^ AJYD KATURE OP THE YELLOW REFER. THE yellow fever, synonimous with la Ma- ladie de siam, or la Fevre matelotte of the French, and vomito prieto of the Spaniards, is the majority or acme, as the intermittent is the infancy, of the remittent bilious fever. It is to the common bilious fever, what the confluent, is to the common mild, small-pox. They are in kind the same, a specifick difference only ex- ists between them. It is conceived in the same matrix, and quickened by the same sun.* It is indigenous to America, and all other warm climates. It is the great outlet, to Americans and Britons, from life to the grave. The rays of the sun, diffused and scattered, are innocent and salutary, but collected and con- densed into a focus are dangerous and hurtful. “ Without the matrix of putrid vegetable matters, there can no more be a bilious or yellow fever generated amongst us, than there can be vegetation without earth, water, or air.’* Hush ^ol. 3, p. 168.

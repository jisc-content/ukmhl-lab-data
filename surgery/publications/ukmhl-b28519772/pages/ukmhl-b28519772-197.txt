I am fully aware, that many, and able surgeons, are of a different opinion; and that arteries are kept to show the gelatine up the tube, and con- solidation up to the first branch- This gluten, it\o doubt, with all its appearance of commencing !>rganization, would have been gradually carri- ed away, had the patient lived but a few weeks, irhe serum and red globules, we all know, quick- ;.y run off, and after a time, as assuredly, the imore tenacious or viscid gluten is dissolved.

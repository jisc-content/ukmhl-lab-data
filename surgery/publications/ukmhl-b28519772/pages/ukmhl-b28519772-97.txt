89 “ But I never could observe any one instance, where I could say that one person was infected by, or received the fever, (yellow fever) from another person who had it.” Hillary, page 145. Dr. Jackson-calls the yellow fever of Jamai- ca an endeihick, and no where mentions its be- ing contagious; who also is of the opinion that tnost epidemicks spread by means of the marsh effluvia^ and not by contagion. Dr. Moscly styles it (the yellow fever) an en- demial causus, page 391. And ridicules the idea of its being malignant, pestilential, and con- tagious, as asserted by Dr. Warren, page 412. Dr. Warren, as Mosely justly observes, had scarcely any idea of this fever at all, except in its description. Towne calls it febris ardens bi- liosa, but does not add contagiosa, and asserts it to be an endemick of the West-Indies. That it appeared, at Barbadoes, anterior to the time (1725) fixed by Dr. Warren is evident from Dr. Gamble, who well remembered it to be very fatal, in the island, in the year 1691. That Warren’s account of the disease is altoge- ther fabulous is certain : this man, wrapt in hy- pothetical clouds, was carried about by every wind of errour.

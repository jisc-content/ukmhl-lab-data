6â€˜0 Who among us would have imagined, tiial the human mind was nothing but a flux of ideas, had not David Hume given currency to this hy- pothesis? Or that thought was a peculiar con- figuration of the combination of material atoms, had not Dr. Priestly introduced it to our ac- quaintance ? But, to come nearer home, who could have supposed that the water-spout, that huge rising of the ocean, was effected by a pow- er of suction resident in the clouds, without the hint of Dr. Franklin.^ * The true and real cause of the water-spout is, a column of electrick fluid descends from the clouds ; this electrick column rarefies the air to a given distance ; the rarefaction of the air causes an unequal pressure on the water; the equal pressure being removed, the water immediately rises, in bulk corres- ponding to the space of the rarefied atmosphere. This column of water ascends in proportion to the levity or thinness of the air, sometimes to an amazing height; and in its ascension ac- quires a whirl occasioned by the circumambient air rushing to a focus to fill up the partial vacuum and restore to itself its former equilibrium. There is a species of water-spout, which, it is said, at times ocqurs on land. This we imagine is produced by a condensa- tion of the aqueous vapours, constituting the cloud, in conse- quence of a sudden loss of electrick fluid and elementary heat., ]K<?arly upon the same principle, it is probable, as hail is form- ed in the'-hotest weather of summer. This phenomenon, to our understanding, is obviously produced by rapid evaporation Occasioned by an almost instantaneous escape of a large quanti- ty of electrick fluid, either from two clouds, tlie one plus and tno other minus, meeting, or from a cloud highly charged pass- ing Within striking distance of some elevated district of land.

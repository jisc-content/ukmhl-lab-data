ness. Those who live in the neighbourhood 6f marshes, in warm climates, and during hot and dry autumns generally suffer more or less. The more elevated situations, and those distant from such sources in the West-Indies and America, most generally escape this deathful malady, ex- cept when the atmosphere becomes universally surcharged with the effluvia emanating from those exuberant fountains of mischief and poi- son ; under such occurrences they unavoidably participate of the evil. This is confirmed by the united voices of writers and practitioners. Males, by being more exposed to these efflu- via floating in the air, to the violent rays of the sun, to night-dews, and to the various, sudden, and great vicissitudes of the weather, (these operate differently according to their respective natures) are more ,subject to this, and all ende- mical epidemicks, than females, whose business is naturally within their houses, where the poi- son is blunted and rendered inert by the fires and smoke, and has itself dissipated by striking against buildings. The skirls of most cities are occupied by the poorer class of inhabitants ; their houses are ex- posed to the first and most violent assaults of all endemical epidemicks ; but as those epidemicks invade more the vitals and heart of a city, they are dissipated, enfeebled, and disarmed.

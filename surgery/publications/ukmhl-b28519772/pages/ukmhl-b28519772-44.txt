S6 ing excepted, at which periods it very rarely takes place, but instances have been furnished where this monthly discharge has regularly, in its usual form, occurred during the whole term of gestation. The instances, however, are ve- ry few in number where matters have been so uniform and regular; and, when they do arise, should be viewed as morbid: and perhaps in those rare cases the fluid may more properly be imagined to be furnished by the vessels of the Os Tincee opening into the Vagina than by the uterine vessels belonging to the hollow of the womb. For it is beyound a doubt that, at the time of conception the mouth of the womb is clo- sed by mucous matter. Therefore the fluid, in the customary way in which it passes off, can- not be discharged from the inside of the womb.

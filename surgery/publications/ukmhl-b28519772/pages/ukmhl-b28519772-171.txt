163 I will close this letter, with a short admoni- on to young practitioners. It would be well for entlemen, when they enter the room of a lyiug- I patient, to carry with them, not their lancet, )r I have understood that those who wear the word are apt imprudently to use the sword, but good stock of composure and patience, and x)nfidence in the resources and abilities of na- •ure; and, above all, a sound, discriminating, /ell-instructed judgment. Thus provided, I ihink that I can assure them, they will seldom eave the room with feelings ungrateful to them- ;elves, or a reputation disadvantageous to the irt of the accoucheur. In my next speculation, I shall confine my pen :o the mechanism of labour. I shall endeavour ;o demonstrate, that if the lancet will relax the uofter parts through which the child is to pass, it .will also reduce the efficiency of the throes, ne- ::essary to the detrusion of the child ; and, that « This remedy (blood-letting) is by no means a new one,^ in I 'abour ; but employed for the express purpose of diminishing f pain, and subduing the various species of rigidity just spoken of, iand carried to an extent that will ensure these objects, that is, diminishing pain, disposing the os uteri to dilate, the external r parts to unfold, &c., originated, as far as I am acquainted, with. myself.'^ Deweesy Essayy p- 63. If, sir, you will compare these two paragraphs, I think you \will coincide in opinion with me, that, were they in dilfbrent Slanguages, the one might, with the strictest, justice, be consi- it dered as a free translation of the other. Did Dr, Deweea ever J md Dr. Rush ?

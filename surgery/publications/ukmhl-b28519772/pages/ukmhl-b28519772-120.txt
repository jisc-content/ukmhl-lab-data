112 cular fibre possesses no vis insita, its sensibility and contractibility are feudatory of the vis ner- via.* The source of life and action must be origi- nally and primarily concerned in all the opera- tions, whether morbid or healthy, of the ani- mal body. The nerves are the “ seat and throne” of all diseases. Whether a fever be the result of a mere me- chanical action, or the provident effort of the vis medicatrix naturae, that power in the body to heal its own maladies, I leave to the more learn- ed to determine. But there is a something about a fever which is more easily recognized than de-' veloped. A peccant entity, acting either mediately as in the form of fracture or wound, produces fever indirectly ; or immediately as in the condition of human or marsh effluvia, he. produces fever directly. In both cases the fever is the conse- quence, and symptomatick: In neither is it strictly idiopathick. It is nothing but a symp- tom of a more primary and essential disturbance of the nervous energy.—This primary and es- sential disturbance is uniformly the disease; whatever succeeds is only indicative of this first disturbance of the quiet and health of the ani- mal system. * Vide Monrb’s nervous system.

Had Pouteau la- boured seven years he could not have hunted ap an experiment more to his purpose. And to vhat state of the artery Jones can possibly al- ude when he says it lorms an insuperable ob- ection to Pouteauâ€™s doctrine, I cannot conjec- ure. If the subject were not the adjustment of m important point of science, I should believe the Doctor was sporting with the easy faith of his reader. I The conical state of the extremity of the di- vided artery we also deduce from this coagula- i:ed blood and lymph compressing the sides. W'hy it is conical is very obvious ; the coagu- lation immediately at the point is greater than It is higher, consequently the extreme end is :more diminished in its volume than farther on. In section the third of the same chapter. Dr. Hones proceeds to show that we are not only to ^expect, in the natural process for the suppress- ion of arterial ha3morrhage, a contraction of the ends of the vessel; but, in addition to this spon- taneous contraction, that we are uniformly to imeet with an external and internal coagulum of tblood, together with a coagulum of lymph in- terfused between those sanguineous coagula. 2 D

123 stances, be exhibited. Our sole trust and der- lier resource is in a well regulated dietetick plan, with now and then a purge to keep the bowels jpen. Nor must the inexperienced suffer the ^;v’eakness of the patient to frighten them from :he free use of purgatives. The habits & desires of the stomach are chief. !y to be consulted after the fever has subsided. But during the height of the fever, neither flesh lor any thing made of flesh can be allowed. Ve- getables are the only articles of food that the pa- tient can be indulged in while the fever pos- sesses any considerable strength. The patient must never take any beverage stronger than barley-water, lemon-ade, cold wa-^ ter, water with a toast in it, and such like mild potables. Some physicians are too cautious in giving cold water, and lemonade during the use of mercury. But I am satisfied from daily prac- tice that no drink is more innocent and beneficial in a fever, especially the yellow fever,- than le- imonade, and cold water ; nor are we to discon- nnue the citrick acid even during the use of cal- )omel. Chymical affinities might induce us to ’.believe that upon an union of the acid and cal- omel, the latter would, by decompounding the former, and attaching to itself part of oxigen, .convert itself into the oxiginated muriate of mer- cury, or what is vulgarly called corrosive sub- limate. This, however in fact does not happen.

37 years, and continued regularly thereafter through the ordinary space of time. OF THE EXCITING CAUSES. We meet with various and greatly different opinions in the writings of Physicians on the cau* ses of the menstrual operation. Ijideed Physio- logists have amused themselves with many con- ceits and visionary speculations as well on the causes as on the effects of this operation. Some have traced the causes up to an imaginary in- fluence of the moon, and others have laboured to prove that they resided in the qualities of the bile. But most of the moderns who have treat- ed of this matter have attributed the causes either to a local congestion of blood in the ute- rine vessels or to a general plethorick condition of the whole body, or to an unequal evolution of the different parts of the body, and density of the arteries. At present indeed there are but few who do not consider the menstrual action to de- pend on the one or the other of the causes re- cited. But in our estimation those who view this fluid as a secretion from the uterine vessels under peculiar ovarious influence, approach much nearer the truth. And we will now de- tail a few of the reasons, by which, the advo- cates of this opinion might establish their sen- timents.

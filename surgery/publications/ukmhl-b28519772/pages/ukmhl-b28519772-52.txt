44 induced to believe that the menstrual opcratioi. is attributable to a partial or general plenitude of the body which in an especial manner prevails at puberty. Although the premises be granted, it will be difficult to understand hov/ it comes to pass, that all girls at a fixed period of life and in the same climate, should have this monthly dis-^ charge. For the truth is that all girls without exception, what life soever they lead or food they use are subject to this operation. And if it should so happen that the menstrual fluid does not pass off at the usual period the eflâ€œorts of na- ture to accomplish such an end will nevertheless come into operation. Whence arises this fulness of body which is so general and uniform, and to which all girls are so obnoxious, of whatever temperament they may be, whether they pass their lives in the city or in the country ; whether they live luxuriously or whether they live on a spare and slender diet ? But if the menstruous flux be not attributable to the influence of the moon, or to the bile, or nitro-aerial spirit, or to a fulness of body, from what causes does it arise ? From what causes proceeds the secretion of semen in the sperma- tick vessels ? Assuredly from the impregna- ting capacity of the testicles. In the same man- ner, also does the menstrual action depend on a condition of the ovaries to be impregnated.

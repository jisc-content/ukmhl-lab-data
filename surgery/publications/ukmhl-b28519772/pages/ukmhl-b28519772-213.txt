205 death. The circular membrane surrounding the divided portions of artery was very much filled with blood; both extremities of the artery were considerably contracted^ particularly the one next to the head, but there was no coagulum,” &c. Experiment 2.—“The animal bled to death, &c. the truncated extremities of the artery had retracted about an inch and a quarter, and were very much contracted^ but their mouths were open ; the arterial sheath and cellular membrane were much distended with dtloodf &c. Experiment 3.—The cut extremities of the ar- tery v/ere separated nearly an inch; both ap- peared to be very much contracted; the surround^ ing cellular membrane and sheath were very much filled with bloodf &cc. « It were a waste of time to recapitulate in de- tail, all the particulars of the nineteen experi- ments of this second section. It may suffice to say that in each one, the above prominent facts were fully ascertained, viz. the contraction of the mouth of the divided extremity^ and injection of the cellular membrane^ surrounding the artery and sheath^ with coagulated blood and lymph, and the mutual recession of the ends of the separa- ted vessel. There can be no dispute about the retraction of the extremities of a divided artery, therefore I shall pass on to the other points.

43 and that every organ before it can perform the function proper to it, must arrive at a state ot maturity; and, other things being equal, that in proportion to the maturity of an orgtin will be the perfection of its function. For instance, a mature condition of the liver, of the testicles, and of the breasts, is altogether necessary for the secretion of the bile, of the seminal fluid, and of the milk. Nor can I conjecture any other source of the menstruous fluid, except it is to be viewed as signs by which we are to under- stand that the womb is so prepared and the o- varies are so evolved as to be suited to the af- fairs for which they are destined. The men- strual action always takes place before a woman can conceive. But, in my opinion, is not so much to be considered as the cause, according to professor Simpson, as sign or result of full puberty.

But as above remarked, there are certain wri- ters, as well ancient as modern, who hav6 been

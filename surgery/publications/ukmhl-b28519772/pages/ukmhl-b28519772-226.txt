219 efTusion, it does not follow that the immediate effects of the ligature was the division of the in- ternal and middle coats, for the ligature might mechanically so affect the susceptible constitu- ent parts of these lunicks as to induce inflamma- tion, gangrene, and sphacelus of the whole cir- cle within the loop, fcvery surgeon knows that the circle within the loop uniformly dies and falls away ; but this is a secondary operation, and does not take place until after the sides, imme- diately above the edge of the mortifying circle, have,united and become Arm. But, in the third place, my chief objection is, that when a ligature is applied, even but for a short time, the interruption to the circulation in the vasa vasorum of the internal and middle lu- nicks, and the bruising they receive, must ex- cite more or less of irritation, which quickly runs on to inflammation. In this state of excite- ment, innumerable facts assure us, that the ex- halents pour out a vast quantity of coagulable lymph. Nor is it requisite that the integrity of the fine vessels should be violated, either for the production of the lymph, or absolute union of the surfaces. We could instance the copious effusion of lymph, along the internal surface of the trachea, in cases of the croup ; also, in in- flammations of the pleura, the numerous occur- rences of a permanent union of the pleura cos- talis with the pleura pulmonalis ; and to these may be superadded the various attachments be-

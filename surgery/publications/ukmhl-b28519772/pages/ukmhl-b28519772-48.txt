But Cullen affirms, that the uterine arteries, as to firmness and density, are unequal to the ar- teries, of the other parts of the body ; that they are more lax and feeble: audit is very ob- vious that the augmentation of bulk in every part of the body is entirely owing to the quantity of blood conveyed to it.

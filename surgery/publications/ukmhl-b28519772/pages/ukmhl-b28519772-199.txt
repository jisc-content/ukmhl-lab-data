191 elbow, the consequent inflammation and swell- ing could not have been inconsiderable. The pressure must increase momentally with the inflammation and tumefaction. And, in fact, if at first the anterior wall of the artery was not in contact with the posterior, it must have been so about the fourth day, the period at which “ the wound was first drest.” This, my conjecture, is strongly corroborated, by the fact of the pin coming away with the dress- ings on the fourteenth day. Here it is certain that the anterior part of the artery must have been affected with high inflammation, and even gangrene and sloughing, or the pin could not have come away with the dressing. It otherwise would have remained for the surgeon to draw out, having previously disengaged the thread. It is clear, and beyond a question, that the front of the vessel mortified and sloughed. Can you conceive it probable, that in a vessel so small, and pressed on as this must have been, the an- terior portion of its circle could inflame, gan- grene, and fall away, and yet its lumen to be preserved, and a current of blood to continue down through it ? If so, your conception is more sprightly and ingenious than mine. But the surgeon says, that “ the pulse was very little altered immediately after the opera- tion,” “ and so strong and equal, that he had no doubt of the blood continuing to circulate freely

The yellow or brown colour of the eyes and skin is owing to an absorption of the bile or brown matter after it is secreted. There is some- times a tempory yellowness of the skin, this may be produced by a peculiar action of the blood-vessels.* The purple spots constitute a pathognomo nick, they are neither the production of an over action of the system, nor a dissolved state of the blood. They are to the yellow fever what the red spots are to the cynanche maligna, or the erup- tions of the skin to the measles ; they are symp- tomatick, and no regular consequence of the general state of the fluids or condition of the solids. Fever is a convulsive action of the arterial system, as mentioned by Dr. Rush, accompa- nied by more or less of a peculiar and indiscrib- able heat and dryness of the skin: The dryness and heat though are not always present ; as iiv the febris ty phodes. This convulsion of the ar- terial system is the result of a more inscrutable and hidden morbidness of the source and seat of life and action, the nervous power. The mus- * Vide Rush.

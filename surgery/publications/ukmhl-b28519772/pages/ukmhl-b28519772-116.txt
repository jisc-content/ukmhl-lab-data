That a violent action on, and not a smothered or incontrollable exer- tion of the system, lays the foundation of those hemorrhages, is obvious. 1. As they do not accompany phrenitis or pneumonia where the vascular exertion is much more fierce, active, and oppressed. 2. Blood-letting after the se- cond or third time, exeept in particular habits, when it is pretty copious, so far from relieving the imaginarily oppressed pulse, rather renders it more feeble and yielding. 3. In the most vi- olent attacks, where there exists the greatest degree of indirect debility, the propriety and safety of immoderate phlebotomy are in the i^-i verse ratio of this indirect debility. I speak from my own experience,'and that of Hillary, and Pouppe Desportes who carried the lancet to itsi greatest extremes, and possessed the most am- ple opportunities of seeing its advantages and disadvantages ; not for one season only but for fifteen or twenty years, during which time he practised in the West-Indies ; as also of several of the most respectable physicians in the city of Baltimore. Lastly, hemorrhages are more apt to occur in those who have been copiously, than in those who have been moderately bled ; pro- vided untimely death, superinduced by those large evacuations, does not obviate them. Sc is mortification about the orifices made by the lancet. Pouppe Desportes, speaking of those hemorrhages, and mortifications, remarks

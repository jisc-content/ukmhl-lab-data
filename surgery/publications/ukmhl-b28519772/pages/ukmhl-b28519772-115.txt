Some physicians have persuaded themselves that this black matter is owing to an admixture of blood, and that there is an absolute want of se- cretion in the yellow fever; this opinion, I must believe, has a more intimate affinity with preju- dice, than with reflection. Hemorrhages seldom overtake the patient in the early stage of the disease, except under the form of epistaxis, which is not commonly consi- derable. When they do occur, they are the indubitable evidence of an atony or paralysis of the blood-vessels and this atony in its turn de*Â» pends on a destroyed vigour of the nervous pow- er ; this destruction of the nervous influence is effectuated by the peccant agency operating di- rectly and immediately on the sensorium com- mune. It is the result of a violent action on the immediate seat of life, and not of the vascular, or arterial system ; the blood-vessels can only be acted on secondarily. If we could timously diminish the quantity of the hostile power, we should infallibly prevent those sanguineous flux- es.

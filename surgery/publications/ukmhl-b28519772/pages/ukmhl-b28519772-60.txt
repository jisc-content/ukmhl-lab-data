How is it that the uterine arteries take upon themselves to secrete this peculiar fluid for a few days each month.^ Upon the same condi- tion that those of the female breast secrete milk after each parturition. Some have brought themselves to believe that it is improbable the arteries of the uterine could secrete, in a few days, so much as is perceived to pass off. It will be no longer wonderful after we satisfy our- selves of the immense quantity the dog will fur- nish in a measured space of time during coition.

And what is it.in the larger arteries which caus- •;s them again and again to pour out their blood ? [To my understanding, the putrefaction and melt- ng down of this coagulum, to which the surge- on unhappily trusts. And as often as the coa- gulum forms, the haemorrhage is stopped ; and IS often as it begins to putrify, and melt down, i .nd fall away, the haemorrhage returns.

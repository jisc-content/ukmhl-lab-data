903 on the basilick vein, if we penetrate so deep as to touch the artery, we for the most part make the incision pretty nearly parallel with the lon- gitudinal fibres of the humeral artery, descend- ing through the fold of the elbow, just before it divides into the ulnar and radial trunks. And yet who ever understood that such wounds would not open in obedience to the elastic pow- er of the circular fibres of the middle coat ? Is there no separation of the lips in those longitu- dinal cuts, when a new wave of blood is impel- led along, forcing the artery into a state of dia- stole ? Surely, my friend, hypothesis has some share in this grave doctrine. But to put all conjecture to rest, I have seen, and demonstrated, in a living artery, a longitu- dinal incision to the extent at least of half an inch: and in this the edges receded very con- siderably from each other, and exposed, in a great degree, the opposite internal surface, al- though the vessel was kept in an extended state, thus mechanically favouring the approximation of the edges, and counteracting the natural re- traction of the circular fibres. Six or eight med- ical gentlemen witnessed this. Were I not writing to Professor Smith, I would take into account, in my behalf, the opi- nion of Monro the father, in his great work, where he says, that if an artery be but slightly wounded, the edges instantly retract, and have

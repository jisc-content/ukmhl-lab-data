APPENDIX. DURING the time that the foregoing Tractate was at the press I accidentally met with the answer of the Physicians of Philadelphia, to the request of the governor, the hon. Thomas Mifflin—in relation to the yellow fever, A perfect and har- monious coincidence unites our sentiments, so far as they res- pect the origin and cure. For the satisfaction and benefit of the public, I will insert the letter. Sir, ‘‘IN compliance with your request, the subscri- bers have devoted themselves to the investigation of the origin, progress, and nature of the fever which lately prevailed in our city ; and we have now the honour of communicating to you the result of our enquiries and observations. We conceive the fever which has lately prevailed in our ci- ty, commonly called the yellow fever, to be the bilious remit- ting fever of warm climates, excited to a higher degree of ma- lignity by circumstances to be mentioned hereafter. Our reasons for this opinion are as follows ; 1st. The sameness of their origin, both being the offspring of putrefaction. Of this there are many proofs in the histo- ries of the yellow fever in the West-Indies. Where there are no putrefaction the West-India islands enjoy a perfect exemp- tion from that disease in common with nothem climates. 2d. The yellow fever makes its appearance in these months chiefly in which the bilious fever prevails in our country and is uniformly checked and destroyed by the same causes; viz. heavy rains and frosts.

145 possible bearing on the subject. I will, for the ’.moment, concede the point before us. Let the menses be formed, and be retained, according io the pleasure of the writer. The total sum of duid, amassed during nine calender, or even ten hinav months, would not be, upon the most li- □eral estimate for fcetal organization, more than :.ive pounds of aliment, allowing six ounces to 2ach menstruous period. An ordinary child weighs from ten to fifteen pounds : that is, from five to ten pounds more than the total sum of the fluid retained. How far does this go to demonstrate, that fce« ml organization derives its sources from the men- istruous fluid? And here I might, not inaptly, subjoin a second problem: If the human foetus ^e made up of the menstruous fluid, whence are .he materials for the organization of the young of the lower animals furnished? They have no rmenses. The Doctor’s proposition extends muqh far- ther. It not only insinuates, but directly main- tains, that this fluid is retained, and yet is trans- iibrmed into fcetal organization ! What! is the menstrual fluid retained with the mother, con- • uituting a source on which we may advantage- ously draw with the lancet, and moreover is tiransformed into foetal organization ? This is a ispecies of logick, to my understanding, neither 'ibrcible nor clear. T

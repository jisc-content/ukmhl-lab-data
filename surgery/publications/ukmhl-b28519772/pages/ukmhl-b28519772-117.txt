The Encephalon although subject to inflam- mation and partial infarction, cannot labour un- der general congestion ; that is, the brain-case cannot contain more at one time than another ; except the bones and sutures become firm and ossined, and in cases where the sutures are af- terwards destroyed by diseases. The medulla- ry substance of the brain is incompressible,! and the case itself is unyielding: When a conges- tion of the right side of the head happens, there is a simultaneous, and equivalent diminution of the arese of the vessels of the left. In case of hydrocephalus there is a general invasion of the arese of the cerebral vessels. In some instances the cortical substance is worn away by attrition. If a general congestion of the brain could take place, a partial vacuum' would of consequence be possible; and if a partial vacuum took place, * Vide Tom- I, page 200- t Vide professor Munro’s incontrovertibU experiments.

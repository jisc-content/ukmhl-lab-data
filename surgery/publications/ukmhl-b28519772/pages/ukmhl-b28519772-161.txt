153 whom do learned gentlemen get their informa- tion? From travellers. From the most correct view I can get of the subject, I am inclined to believe, that natural labours (all labours are natural in themselves, and only unnatural in their circumstances) are .as frequently interrupted by rigidity of the os uteri, with or without inflammation, among the laborious negroes of the farm, or the peasants of the thatched hut, as among the most delicate ladies, who live amidst all the luxuries of civi- lization and refinement; indeed, much more so. My opportunities, on this head, are not very li- mited. It avails nothing to say, that we have depart- rsd from the life of the savage, and that an equal departure from the simple dictates of nature, in search of a corrective, is necessary. With the vsavage and with the civilized woman, the mecha- nism of labour is the same. There is a certain piompound resistence to be overcome by the co- o)peration of given forces of expulsion. A change from the savage mode, to that of civilized life, iioes not, and cannot, alter the relation between l:his sum of compound resistence and these forc- es of expulsion. It neither abstracts from the iiggregate of one, nor diminishes the efficiency the other. If the one be altered, the other is equally altered. They are equally dependent ^on the same economy of the general whole. tJ

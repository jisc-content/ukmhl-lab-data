192 through it.‚Äù What! is there no way but the great trunk for the blood to get into the radial and iilner arteries ? Are there no anastamosing branches which might possibly convey it down,; and thus support the pulsation of the radial or ulner artery ? I have seen, and any surgeon may see when he pleases, the upper portion o^ the temporal artery beat freely and strongly when its trunk below has been absolutely cut asunder by the shoulder of the lancet; not sure- ly by a continuance of the circulation through the trunk, but by the return blood through the anastamosing branches. Superadded to the chance by tho collateral branches, is it not possible, and indeed highly probable, that in this solitary case of success, the great trunk may have divided, high up in the arm, and of consequence a large portion of the blood would go off, and thus support the pulsa- tion below ? That the diameter of the artery was complete- ly annihilated, all the circumstances of the case tend to prove. And as to the pulsation below, I can readily conceive it to be kept up by the cir- culation through the anatomising branches, as, already remarked, or the possible lusus naturae, the branching off, high up the arm, of the radi- al trunk. And had the arm upon the death of the patient been injected, we have every reason to believe the canal ofthe artery would have been

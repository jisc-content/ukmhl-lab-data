187 the sides of the vessel, up to the first braneh, I admit it; but not from contraction, nor coagu- lation, but from the walls of the artery being forced into contact by mechanical agency; and this would happen not only up to the first branch, but up as high as the mechanical force acted. At first, immediately on tying of the vessel, there may be, and really is, a coagulum with- inâ€”-yet this soon melts down, and is mixed with the common circulating mass. And here the surgeon is deceived. He takes the column of jelly, in a few weeks to be melted away? for liv- ing substance, filling up the tube. Yourself and every other gentleman accus- tomed to the knife, knows, from repeated obser- vation, that when an artery is divided, it retracts^ land draws itself up within its cellular sheath; :but the contraction of a divided arlery even in a ' slight degree is to be conceded with caution. If an artery is to be provoked by adventitious stif rmulus, it will contract; and this so long as its excitability shall be exposed to foreign stimula- tion. But it is not on this that the surgeon is to ; depend. It is uncertain, irregular, and of small : compass, When an artery is divided, lies exposed, and i has its calorick with the fluid, which fills its vasa vvasorum, to fly off, it is possible that its canal rnxaybe diminished below the natural state of its, systole; though this is too lanimportant to be

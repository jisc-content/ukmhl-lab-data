53 U'c now turn our attention to the circum- stance of tlie total cessation of the menstrual operation about the forvy-fifth or fiftieth year. Those who have favoured the opinion of this action depending on plethora have not been in- attentive to this fact. They supposed that this discharge ceased at this epoch, because the ar- teries of the womb had become so firm as to be competent to afford an adequate resistance to the impulsion of the blood. We can scarcely ])e induced to admit that the uterine arteries oi every woman would at this age be uniformly and equally so firm or so diminished in their capa- city as to present an ins'urmountable barrier to the current of blood. The thing is far from be- ing probable. This cessation is in my estima- tion, deducible from some other source. That is, at this period, the ovaries lose altogether their disposition to fecundity. For nature, wise in her provisions, has by an unchangeable law ordered that the menstruous action should be discontinued, and the ovaries should lose their capacity to be impregnated, which served as an excitement to the womb, at that period when women could no longer afford nutriment to their offspring.

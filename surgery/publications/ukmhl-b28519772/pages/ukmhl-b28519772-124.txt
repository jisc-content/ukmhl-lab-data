116 ^ith a very frequent or full puisc the lancet must be resorted to. This however will rare- ly be the case after two or three good bleedings, except in particular habits. Some habits will bear the lancet to the fifth or sixth repetition, es- pecially where the indirect debility of the system is not great and where there is great heat of the surface of the body, and the tongue white. A timous use of the lancet more effectually than any other remedy,. tends to prevent the ra- pid progress of the inflammation of the different viscera. When it has taken place blood-letting promises more liberally than all other remedies. But when bleeding is carried to too great ex- tremes, it exhausts the general system and pros- trates the powers of life in so great a degree, that the animal frame can never renew its func- tions ; it hastens, by robbing the blood-vessels of internal support ^nd nourishment, that atony and palsy of the vascular system which lays the ground-work of those melancholy hemorrhages. When blood-letting is had recourse to, it should be practised within the first three or four days. It may, under particular circumstances, be performed at later periods, but not with such propitious consequences. I have practised it, as late as the tenth and fifteenth day of the dis- ease, in instances where the patientâ€™s strength had not been sapped by evacuations.

The rupture of this ligament is an accident of such rare occurrence, that the following case, drawn up by the patient, may not be uninteresting. I have lately had an opportunity of exam- ining the limb, which presents the following appearance. The ligament has been torn from its attachment to the tibia; the patella is drawn up, and become fixed in the front of the thigh; the knee-joint is, therefore, quite uncovered; no bandage can be borne, as it is found materially to impede the motion of the limb:— u Sir,—The accident to my knee, which happened four years ago the 27th of last May, occurred, as nearly as I can remember, in the following manner:— “ I was running very fast, and, fearing the object of my pursuit (a rat) would escape me, was in the act of endeavouring to pro- pel myself faster by springing further at a time, when, the moment I made the effort, which was with my right leg, I felt a strong shock all over me, very similar to that of a tolerably good sized Leyden jar, highly charged, accompanied by a deep, dull sound, much resembling that produced by the breaking in of the covering stone of a shallow drain gutter.

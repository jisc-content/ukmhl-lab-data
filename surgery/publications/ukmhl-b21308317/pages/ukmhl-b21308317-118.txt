90 AMPUTATION IN SPREADING GANGRENE. nails excited some suspicion in my mind, and occasioned me to watch its progress with great anxiety. The rapidity with which the gangrene spread was very remarkable. There was no such appearance at five in the morning; the operation was decided on and performed soon after eight. Case II.â€”Thomas Baddis, a stout youth of eighteen, was admitted into the Bridgwater Infirmary at an early hour on Sunday morning, who had suffered severe injuries of both legs, from their having become entangled in the coils of a rope attached to a steam-tug, which was towing a vessel up the river.

CASE OF POLYPUS OF THE UTERUS. 155 the attempt was made it was found impracticable, in consequence of the polypus being so soft and yielding, as to render it im- possible to carry the ligature over its stem. As the patient’s safety depended on the immediate removal of the tumor, I insinuated my hand into the posterior part of the vagina, in the hope of being able to place a ligature around it, until I found the stalk between my fingers ; I then twisted it off, and withdrew the largest polypus I ever saw ; no hemorrhage or bad symptom followed, and in a few days the patient was quite well. From subsequent experience, I should be inclined to pursue this practice, or cut off the stem whenever it is to be got within reach, in preference to the more tedious plan of tying the poly- pus, and allowing it to slough off TWO CASES OF ACCIDENTAL PASSAGE OF A FEMALE CATHETER INTO THE BLADDER. In the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal, Mr. Worth- ington, relates a case of successful extraction of a calculus from the bladder of a female by Weiss’s dilator, and states, u that the process of dilatation was commenced at eight o’clock in the morning, and that at the end of every two hours he visited the patient for the purpose of giving the screw of the instrument from a quarter to half a turn.” Having understood from those who have employed that instrument, that it occasions much pain, I have never used it in my own practice, but have preferred dilating the urethra with sponge-tent, which I have always found a safe, effectual, and easy mode of accomplishing the object. I have twice succeeded in this way in extracting a female catheter which had accidentally slipped into the bladder, with so much ease, that I should always adopt the same plan with confidence, for the removal of calculus or any other foreign body. Case I.—During the year 1840 I was requested by a medical friend to meet him in consultation on a case where he had per- mitted a silver catheter to slip into a lady’s bladder. The patient

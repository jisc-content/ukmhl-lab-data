Hnuimsrnws nf it Miical Eife, WITH CASES, ETC. ON COUNTER-IRRITATION. The efficacy of counter-irritation in arresting the progress, and promoting the cure of disease, is well known; but I do not think the extent to which it may be advantageously carried, is so tho- roughly understood. I do not advocate its rash and dangerous use, as practised by some, although experience has convinced me that a more free employment of this powerful remedy, often leads to successful results. In 1841 this subject was brought before the profession, in an article in the Provincial Medical and Sur- gical Journal; and since that period I have had many oppor- tunities of testing the practice, and have been entirely satisfied with its success. A prejudice exists against this practice, which is by some designated barbarous, by others heroic, or unnecessary. But I confess myself at a loss for a substitute in cases in which a powerful and speedy effect is desirable. I have employed it with marked advantage in epilepsy, obsti- nate head-ache of long standing, in threatened paralysis, and in cases in which there has been reason to suspect effusion, as well as in other chronic diseases of a formidable nature. I prefer the mode of keeping up counter-irritation explained in the paper above referred to, to setons, blister, or moxas, as being more manageable, more effectual, and less painful. I am not sure that the actual cautry (barbarous as it may appear), should be entirely abandoned, and I have sometimes employed it with manifest benefit.

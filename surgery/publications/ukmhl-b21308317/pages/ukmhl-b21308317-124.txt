96 ABSCESS OF THE BREAST. This abscess forms in and behind the mammary gland, more slowly and with less pain than the common milk abscess; it does not come to the surface so soon, neither is the skin so much inflamed, or the fluctuation so distinct; consequently it is not opened early, but burrows behind and around the gland, breaking in several places, and forming sinuses in a variety of directions, none of which show a disposition to heal. The usual treatment is unavailing in these cases ; a great discharge is constantly kept up, which soon affects the general health, and reduces the patient to a state of great debility, which I believe would destroy her, unless proper means were resorted to to arrest the disease. The first case of the kind which fell under my care, was that of a lady who had been confined three months, and was much exhausted by pain and constant discharge. The breast, which was naturally full and fleshy, was not much increased in size, but had an un- healthy appearance, with several openings, leading to deep sinuses, communicating with each other in various directions. At this time I was not aware of the obstinate nature of the disease, and endeavoured to heal these by injections of sulphate of zinc, stim- ulating frictions, and pressure evenly applied with plaster and bandage; but all my efforts were ineffectual, and I was under the necessity of dividing all the sinuses, which ran through the whole substance of the breast ; so that it was literally cut into strips. The operation was a serious one, and attended with considerable hemorrhage, but the good effects were presently apparent; for as soon as my patient had recovered from the immediate shock of the operation, the wounds assumed a healthy aspect; she rapidly got better, and recovered perfectly in six weeks. At her next confinement, she came from a considerable distance to place her- self under my care, and as there was no hope of her ever being able to furnish milk again from that breast, I covered it carefully with a diachylon plaster as soon as she was delivered, which completely suspended the secretion of milk in that breast, although she was able to nurse as well as usual in the other; and she passed through her confinement without the least inconve- nience. Since that time she has had several other children, and

76 NECROSIS OF THE FEMUR. brawny, and slightly discoloured. About sixteen months before, in turning rather suddenly, it broke. Very little union took place for nine months, and it never became strong. It did not appear that he had suffered much pain before the fracture, but since that time there has been a good deal, but not of a severe character.

In the eleventh volume of the Transactions of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, my friend Mr. Turner, of Manchester, has published an elaborate and excellent paper on dislocation of the astragalus, in which he states that it is an accident of unfrequent occurrence, but, in its characters and consequences, extremely serious. Every additional example, therefore, of the successful treatment of this important accident, cannot fail of being acceptable to the profession. The following case occurred lately in the practice of my son, Mr. J. B.

177 APPENDIX.--WOUND OF THE PALMAR ARCH. Whilst these sheets were passing through the press, a case of wound of the palmar arch fell under the care of Mr. Alford, the senior surgeon of the Taunton Hospital, who kindly favoured me with the following note :— ic William Andrews, aged twenty-three, servant, Langport ; admitted July 30th, 1853. Wound of the palm of right hand ; hemorrhage from the palmar arch. July 6th, fell on some glass, and wounded the palm of the right hand—rather the carpal side of the middle. Considerable bleeding, restrained by compresses over the wound, and over the ulnar and radial arteries, with firm bandaging, under the treatment of Mr. Larcombe. At the end of a week, or ten days, the bleeding returned, and was again restrained by pressure ; but it has returned at intervals, until the time of his admission to the hospital. u July 31st. The bandages were removed, and the wound ex- posed ; it was filled with a coagulum, and, as there appeared no immediate tendency to hemorrhage, it was dressed, and bandaged up again ; the fingers, and hand generally, were swollen and painful. u August 4th. Bleeding came on freely. The hand was again bandaged, and the arm kept forcibly bent at the elbow at an acute angle, according to a suggestion of Dr. Toogood’s. This suc- ceeded for a time, but on the least movement of the fingers or hand, the bleeding returned ; and this continued at inter- vals, till the evening of August 6th, when, the bandages having been removed, the patient put under chloroform, and the bra- chial artery commanded, a free incision was made in the palm, enlarging the original wound transversely, and towards the wrist; three ligatures were applied, and the bleeding ceased. The ligatures came away in a few days, the swelling of the hand subsided, and the man was discharged, with the wound nearly healed, on August 19th.”

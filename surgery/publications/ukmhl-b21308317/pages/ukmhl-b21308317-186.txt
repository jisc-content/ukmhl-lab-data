PASSAGE OF CATHETER INTO THE BLADDER. 158 Case II.—Elizabeth Creed, married about four months, had retention of urine, and was relieved several times by the catheter, when, in passing it one day, it unfortunately slipped from the surgeon’s fingers into the bladder. No attempt was made to extract it, and about a fortnight afterwards she was brought a distance of thirty miles to the Bridgwater Infirmary. Having as- certained the presence of the instrument, I introduced a piece of sponge tent into the bladder in the evening, and allowed it to remain during the night. On the following morning I withdrew the sponge and passed my finger with some difficulty into the bladder, and felt the catheter resting on the pubes, from whence it was brought into the urethra with a pair of dressing forceps, and readily extracted. In this case the instrument remained in the bladder seventeen days, and produced considerable irritation. There was much greater difficulty in dilating the urethra in this than in the former case, which occurred after delivery; in the latter, the urine passed involuntarily until the fourth day; but in the former, the urethra regained its power immediately after the removal of the catheter. Two such cases having been brought to my notice within a few months, it would appear that this accident is not of such rare occurrence as is generally imagined. It may readily happen, with the instruments usually employed, from sudden shrinking, or change of the patient’s posture. Under this apprehension I always use a flexible male catheter, which is more convenient and cleanly, particularly in all cases where it is necessary to empty the bladder during labour. I have repeatedly found the sponge-tent extremely useful in opening the neck of the uterus for the purpose of exploring its cavity, and for the removal of tumors. The introduction gives but very slight pain, and the dilatation is so gradually effected, as scarcely to be felt.

COUNTER-IRRITATION, 4 the doctor; I will ask and answer every necessary question, and if you do not understand me, I will allow you to ask an explana- tion once, but not a second time.” When the period arrived that her recovery was so far advanced, that it appeared safe to allow her to stand, and use gentle gestation, I did not like to make so decided a change without his sanction, and as her brother was going to London, I requested him to call on Mr. Abernethy with a letter describing as concisely as possible, her state, and asking his opinion. On learning the object of the visit he returned my letter to her brother un-opened with the following remark, “ that if her medical man, who had constant opportunities of seeing the patient, could not judge better than himself at a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, it was time for him to give up his prac- tice. ” It may be interesting to some, who have not enjoyed the privi- lege of confidential correspondence with this distinguished man, to know the usual style of his letters. The following is a reply to mine, respecting a patient who had consulted him, whose case was hopeless. u My dear Sir,—All I can say to patients situated as yours is, after telling them what treatment seems rational and appro- priate to the case, to exhort them not to despond; because we know many obstinately disordered states of the bowels, which have continued until they have nearly exhausted the patient, have unexpectedly arrived at a kind of crisis, by the production of morbid discharges &c. And with regard to local diseases, the proverb of 6 ’tis a long lane that has no turning’, is fully verified, for when least expected, a favourable change often occurs, as I suppose you can testify. In every situation of life our primary enquiry ought to be what is right to be done, and having as- certained as far as we have the power, we must then perform or endure it. I have no objection to opiates when required to soothe pain;” and he adds, in reference to caseii, u I hope Miss F— will do well under your care; I know the amendment of the health is the primary object in the cure of all local diseases;

TO FRANCIS SIBSON, M.D., F.R.S. Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; Physician to St. Mary's Hospital. My Dear Dr. Sibson, I inscribe the following pages to you, in testimony of my esteem for your professional abilities, and private friendship; and in grateful acknowledgment of the skill, unremitting attention, and great kindness, with which you conducted me safely through a very severe and dangerous illness. I do not presume that they will be found to possess any merit beyond a faithful record of cases and observations, during a life devoted to the study and practice of my profession. That you may long exercise talent of no ordinary kind, and enjoy health to enable you to practise a profession of which you are so distinguished a inember, is the sincere wish of Your attached Friend, JONATHAN TOOGOOD.

DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 108 ence confirms that opinion. For many years past I have been in the habit of prescribing the diluted aloetic pill, known for some time as Dr. Marshall Hallâ€™s pill, as one of the most certain, and, at the same time, mildest aperients, especially if taken during a meal. Four grains at tea-time will generally be found to ensure the effectual action of the bowels on the following morning. I believe the success of this medicine depends a good deal on the careful preparation of the aloes. So far from pro- ducing the disease so much dreaded, I have frequently employed it for the cure of that troublesome complaint, with much success. In all such cases, it is necessary to change the name, and sub- stitute for it, Pil. Alterat. Aperient., to remove the apprehension of the patient. The combination of a tonic, and sometimes a mild opiate, with an aperient, is well known to render the operation more easy and effectual. In a case in which it appeared that the difficult regulation of the bowels arose from debility, the Bar- badoes aloes and quinine, in doses of three grains of the former to two of the latter, had an admirable effect; and the patient has regulated the bowels for more than fifteen years by varying the dose from five grains of the mixture to two. %

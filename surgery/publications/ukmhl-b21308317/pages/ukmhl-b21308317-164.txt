136 TIIE PRACTICE OF MIDWIFERY. Gregoire mentions his having seen sixteen in a practice of thirty years ; and by Bonetus, Hildanus, and others, we are supplied with a number of similar instances. But the greatest number of these histories, having been preserved as records of remarkable rather than instructive facts, many important circumstances have been omitted or overlooked, from a presumption that the case was without a remedy. u A considerable proportion of the deaths which have happened suddenly in the time of labour, or soon after delivery, may pro- bably have been in consequence of a laceration of the womb, or its appendages ; of some, the cause has not been discovered till after death, and of many more, has never been explained, from the bodies having been interred without anatomical inspection.

She tied the navel string, returned the bowels into the abdomen, and without

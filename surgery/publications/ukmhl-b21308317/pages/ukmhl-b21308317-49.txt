21 ADMINISTRATION OF DIURETICS. those medicines which are known under the denomination of diuretics, are generally uncertain in their operation, nor has it been explained why the same class of medicine succeeds in one case, and fails in another, in which no appreciable difference in the condition of the patient can be ascertained ; for although the late researches have led to a more accurate discrimination into the different states of the urine, and consequently to a more scientific method of treating these diseases, we often have the mortification of finding, that, however skilful our treatment may be, or however appropriate our remedies to each individual case, our practice is unsuccessful. It is not my intention to discuss the various forms of dropsy which are met with in practice, or the effects of remedies generally ; but it may be useful to relate two or three cases which resisted the ordinary treatment, but subsequently yielded to various remedies, although no different cause of disease, or indeed unsoundness of any of the viscera, could be detected, by the most accurate examination. William Jennings, aged 46, contracted an ague in October, which continued during the winter, and in the following spring I found him still with a tertian ague, and generally anasarcous. The effusion was so great, that it was impossible, by the most careful examination, to ascertain accurately the condition of the different viscera, but it was very evident that there was a con- siderable accumulation of fluid in the cavity of the abdomen. My first object was to cure his ague, which was effected by bark, the arsenical solution of Fowler having failed; after which various purgatives and diuretics were directed, and steadily per- severed in, without affording the least relief. He daily became worse, and the whole cellular tissue was so enormously loaded, that he was unable to wear his usual clothes. As every variety of diuretic had been repeatedly and ineffectually tried, I de- spaired of his recovery, when it occurred to me that the late Dr. Parry, of Bath, had recommended the fresh squill in a variety of cases, which he stated to have been successful in his hands. Six grains of fresh squill, in infusion of gentian, three times a day, considerably increased the flow of urine in four days, and

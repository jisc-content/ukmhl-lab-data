cases of doubtful, and not infrequently, malignant character, apparently cured, which return in an aggravated form, and run a rapid and fatal course. In many such, if the report had been delayed for a time, a very different result would have been shown. But country practitioners, living in the same locality with their patients, generally trace their cases from the commencement, and throughout their progress, to the end. The recital of the daily progress and treatment of cases is often tedious, and seldom read by those whose time is much occupied. Their object is to arrive at the practical points as speedily as possible. I have endeavoured to present the following (the greater number of which occurred many years since,) as clearly and concisely as possible; and although nothing new may be found, yet I trust they will not be wholly unacceptable, inasmuch as all accumulation of facts must possess some value, in the interesting and difficult study of medicine. Taunton, 1853.

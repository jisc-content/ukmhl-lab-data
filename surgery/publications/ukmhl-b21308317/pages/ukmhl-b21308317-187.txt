159 CASE OF LACERATION OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE VAGINA AND CERVIX UTERI, SUCCESSFULLY TREATED. In a paper published by Mr. Birch, in' the 13th vol. of the Medico Chirurgical Transactions, he states that lacerations of the posterior part of the vagina, and cervix uteri, always prove fatal.

Case I.â€”Mrs. Collins, a delicate woman of thirty, was seized with uterine hemorrhage at the seventh month, which recurred twice slightly before the completion of the eighth, when it increased suddenly to an alarming extent.

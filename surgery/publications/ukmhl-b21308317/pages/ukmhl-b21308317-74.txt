RECOVERY FROM TAKING ARSENIC. 46 CASE OF .RECOVERY FROM TAKING TWO DRACHMS OF ARSENIC. W. R. aged 17, swallowed two drachms of arsenic, which he coarsely bruised with the end of a bottle, at nine, p.m., on the 2nd of June, 1817, with a view to self-destruction.

Vomiting was soon excited, and briskly kept up, by copious draughts of warm water for two hours. Nothing was retained on the stomach during the night, and he complained of constant and severe pain in the stomach and bowels. He passed the night without rest, and on the following morning he com- plained still of great pain in his stomach and bowels, was very hot, with a frequent pulse and flushed countenance. He was copiously bled, and his bowels were relieved by injections, but nothing could be retained on the stomach until the evening after the application of a blister. Effervescing medicines, with opium, were then kept with difficulty, but he was not so much relieved, until the fourth, to make his recovery certain. BITE OF A COMMON VIPER.

20 GENERAL ANASARCA. was regular and progressive, by strict attention to the bowels, and a mild nutritious diet. CASE OF GENERAL ANASARCA CURED BY SPON- TANEOUS HCEMORRHAGE FROM THE NOSE. A robust man, aged 30, by trade a baker, a free liver, got out of health, and became anasarcous; at the time I was consulted the oedema was very general. All the usual remedies had been employed without relief, and he was so much oppressed, that little hope of recovery remained. The disease appeared to me to have had an inflammatory origin, and it seemed desirable that he should be bled; but it was impossible to find a vein, from the great distension of his limbs. On the following day he was seized with bleeding from the nose, which was allowed to con- tinue for some hours, without any attempt to check it, and was at length stopped with difficulty. It recurred the next morning, and continued so profuse during that day and the succeeding one, that his life was in imminent danger. On the fourth day it abated, and entirely ceased on the fifth, leaving him in an exceed- ingly exhausted state. It was now observed that the oedema had much diminished, and it gradually subsided altogether. He slowly recovered, and followed his usual occupation for some years; but pursuing his intemperate habits, he was attacked with inflammation of the brain, and died in a few days. On examina- tion, the brain exhibited marks of acute inflammation, with great effusion of fluid. This case shows in a striking manner, the extraordinary efforts of nature to relieve herself; and although no doubt existed that the original attack was inflammatory, and that more benefit was to be expected from bleeding than any other remedy, still I should not have ventured to abstract so large a quantity (several pounds) as he lost naturally.

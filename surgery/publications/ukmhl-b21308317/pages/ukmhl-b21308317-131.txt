WOUND OF THE PALMAR ARCH. 103 time of the plan proposed by M. Darwell (vide L’Union Medi- cale and Medical Gazette,) of employing forced flexion for arresting hemorrhage, in wounds of the palmar arch. The principle he lays down is, “ that in most arterial lesions of the fore-arm, forcible flexion supersedes the ligature of the vessels.” I have seen this practice successful in a wound of the fore-arm, accompanied with profuse hemorrhage, the source of which was rendered uncertain, from the swollen and altered state of the limb, and the same practice may probably be adopted in some wounds of the lower extremities. CASE OF POPLITEAL ANEURISM UNSUCCESS- FULLY TREATED BY COMPRESSION. Sloughing of the Tumor, and Ligature of the femoral Artery— Mortification of the Limb and Amputation—Recovery. William Lawrence, a tailor, aged thirty-six, had an aneurism of the popliteal artery, which he attributed to jumping suddenly off the board on which he worked. He was much attenuated, with loss of appetite, and very rapid pulse, and got but little sleep, from his dread of an operation, which he had been told was necessary. The tumor occupied the whole of the popliteal space, and the limb was much reduced in size. On the 16th of February, firm compression was made on the tumor, which was gradually increased to the 20th, when the pulsation in the tumor was less perceptible, but he complained that the pressure disturbed his rest, and the leg was very oedematous. It was discontinued on the following day, in con- sequence of a dark spot having been observed on the tumor, and his general state being worse. On the 26th, the tumor burst, when he lost about a pint of blood, and became very faint. It was stopped by pressure made with a pledget of lint. 27th. Was much sunk from loss of blood. On removing the bandage and examining the part, a large clot of dark coloured blood fell on the ground; this was followed by the loss of about

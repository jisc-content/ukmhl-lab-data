CROWING INSPIRATION OF CHILDREN. 33 was no convulsion, which invariably happened when the attack was severe. Case V.â€”M. A. T., a sister, a delicate child, born at eight months, was very well until six months old, when she was seized exactly as her brothers had been, without any pre- vious indisposition. These attacks recurred frequently until the end of May, after which time she had slight ones. Convulsions, lividity of the countenance, and evacuation of the contents of the rectum and bladder, always accompanied the attacks.

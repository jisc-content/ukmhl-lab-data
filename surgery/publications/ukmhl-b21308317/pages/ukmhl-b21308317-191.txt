163 PREVENTION OP SORE NIPPLES pregnant, a nurse, or some well-intentioned but injudicious friend, advises that the breasts should be kept warm, and covered with flannel, which generally renders the tender skin of the nipples more liable to ulcerate. If the assistance of the surgeon has not already been required by the threatened formation of abscess, he is seldom consulted until much mischief has taken place ; domestic remedies have been ex- hausted in vain, and the mother, worn out by pain and long suffering, is about to consign her infant either to the precarious alternative of dry nursing, or to the care of a foster-mother— evils, of which it is difficult to determine which is the greatest. In my experience, the simple and opposite plan of keeping the parts cool, especially over and around the nipples, and the early use of such remedies as harden the delicate skin, so as to enable it to bear the pressure of the child’s lips, has invariably pre- vented this troublesome affection.

I have always found bathing the part two or three times a day with a lotion, com- posed of seven ounces of decoction of oak bark to two drachms of tincture of myrrh, and common alum, perfectly successful, if commenced early, and steadily pursued. ON THE BURNING FEVER OF HIPPOCRATES. The late Sir Henry Halford, in his u Essays and Orations,” read before the Royal College of Physicians, describes the Kauo-o?, or burning fever of Hippocrates, known by us under the name of brain fever, and illustrated by Aretceus in one of the most interesting medical details which have come down to us from antiquity. In this disease the patient is the first person to discover that he is about to die, and announces this to his attendants. Sir Henry relates a case, the symptoms and pro- gress of which passed under his own immediate observation, which I transcribe. u A young gentleman, twenty-four years of age, who had

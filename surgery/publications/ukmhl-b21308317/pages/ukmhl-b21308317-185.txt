157 PASSAGE OF CATHETER USTO THE BLADDER. and a long time afterwards an abscess formed in the side, which was open and discharged freely for some days, when, on passing a probe, a hard substance was felt, and extracted with a pair of common forceps, which proved to be a catheter. This aifords a good example of the advantage resulting from the publication of rare cases. I consulted my library in vain for assistance, and many of my friends, none of whom had ever met with, or read of, a similar accident. All could advise the best mode of avoiding it, but nobody could point out the remedy. Being in correspondence with Sir Astley Cooper at the time, I requested his opinion, and received in reply the following laconic but very satisfactory letter :— 66 My Dear Sir,—The plan is as follows : 661st. Introduce a piece of sponge (sponge tent), for three or four hours, into the meatus. u 2nd. Remove it, pass the finger, and turn the instrument into the long axis of the bladder. u 3rd. Remove it with common dressing forceps. u If left, it will form a calculus, of which I have a beautiful specimen. Verbum sat. u Let me know the result. u Yours truly, “J. Toogood, Esq.” “ ASTLEY COOPER.” Sir A. Cooper obligingly showed me a drawing of a calculus, formed over a catheter which had got into the bladder, and which he removed by the usual operation, some years since, at Guy’s Hospital. I observed, in this case, that the whole internal lining of the vagina was in a sloughing state, which I think very frequently occurs after laborious parturition, where the head rests for many hours in the vagina, although I do not remember to have seen it noticed; much of the soreness and pain which women complain of after such labours arises, in my opinion, from this cause, and would, probably, lead to adhesions, if nurses did not use the pre- caution of smearing the parts frequently with ointment.

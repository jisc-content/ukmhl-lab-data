84 RUPTURE OF THE LIGAMENT OF THE PATELLA. went to bed, when a considerable enlargement of the joint took place, accompanied by much pain, both of which continued to increase until about two oâ€™clock the next morning, when the swelling ceased to enlarge, and the pain began to abate. I remained in bed about eight or nine days, during which time I kept my leg and thigh extended in a right line, as near as I possibly could, and, for a length of time afterwards, when I got out of bed (which was only to sit in a chair), I had always some one to assist me, and keep my leg and thigh in a straight position. I went on, I thought, doing tolerably well, until about the 24th of August (nearly three months), when I unfortunately got another fall, by my left foot slipping two or three inches into a wheel rut; my right knee immediately bent forward, and I came down on my back, and, while I was in the act of falling, I heard something in my knee snap, very much like the sudden breaking of a small dry stick; I then felt such very severe pain that it made my teeth chatter in my head, and a considerable enlarge- ment of my knee again took place, which obliged me to lie in bed some days, as near in my former position as I possibly could. I had walked and rode on horseback frequently before I met with my second fall, and in the early part of that day I had walked nearly three miles, and I have also flattered myself that I could walk much better, faster, and stronger, than ever I have been able to do since that time. After leaving my bed again, I con- tinued to sit in a chair for a fortnight or three weeks, with my leg and thigh in the position I have just before described, the swelling gradually diminishing, and the pain abating, until my knee was reduced to its original size, which it took two or three months to do, and up to the present time I have never felt any pain whatever in my knee, except it may be a little fatigued at times in over-walking; I am never without a strong stick in my hand, for fear of an accident, for I am as liable to fall now, by the sudden giving way of my knee, as I was when the accident first happened. If I bring my thigh into a horizontal position, with my leg unsupported, it will immediately fall down to a right angle with my thigh, and I am not able, by any power in my

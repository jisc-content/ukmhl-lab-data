PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS FOR RELIEF OF SICK. 169 such a sum as would enable the patient to make the necessary depositâ€”that sum never exceeding four shillings. This plan has been found to work well. The benefits of this charity were soon so apparent, that an appeal to the public a few years afterwards was so liberally re- sponded to, that the governors found themselves in a position to purchase a house well suited for the purpose, excellently situated, and capable of affording accommodation to thirty in- patients, and an unlimited number of out-patients. This ex- ample was followed by other towns, and several local institutions have since been established on a similar plan. I am no advocate for indiscriminate medical charity, which now- a-days is carried to far too great an extent; I am quite aware also, that Boards of Guardians constantly take advantage of private charity, and send their expensive sick paupers to hospitals, for the purpose of saving their own pockets, and displaying a reduc- tion of expenditure under the New Poor Law. These abuses ought to be strictly guarded against ; but if the funds are scrupulously administered, according to the intentions of the donors, this description of charity will be found to claim superiority over all others, by its easy attainment and compa- ratively trifling expense. z

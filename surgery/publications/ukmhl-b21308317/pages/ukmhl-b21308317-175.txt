SUCCESSFUL REMOVAL OF THE UTERUS BY LIGATURE. The following case, although not similar to that published by the late Mr. Crosse, of Norwich, affords an additional ex- ample of the safety and propriety of removing the uterus under certain circumstances. About sixteen years ago I was requested to visit Miss L., aged about forty, who was represented to be suffering from a consider- able swelling, which prevented her from passing any water. The introduction of the catheter was rendered somewhat difficult, from the protrusion of a large mass from the vagina, but after a little time I succeeded in drawing off between two and three pints of water, and then proceeded to make a more accurate examina- tion. I found that the uterus was completely prolapsed, and hanging down between the thighs. There was not much diffi- culty in returning it, or retaining it in its natural situation by a large globular Indian-rubber pessary, which I directed to be removed occasionally and replaced. I heard nothing more of my patient for three years, when I was again desired to see her on account of a profuse and most offensive discharge, which had existed for some time. To my very great surprise I discovered that the pessary had never been removed, which at once explained the cause, and I was actually obliged to deliver her of it with the forceps.

This course was pursued until the 13th of April last, when it came down, and, after making repeated

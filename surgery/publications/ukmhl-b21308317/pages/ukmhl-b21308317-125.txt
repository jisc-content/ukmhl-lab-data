97 ABSCESS OF THE BREAST. uniformly adopted the same course, with the like success. I have met with three other cases, which were treated in the same manner, with the same result. I was consulted on another case, in which the patient refused to submit to the plan proposed, and tried various remedies under different practitioners, but wtas at last obliged to have the same operation performed. If I saw one of these cases in an early stage, I should not hesitate to make a free opening the instant the formation of matter could be ascer- tained, in the hope of preventing so painful and severe an operation. FUNGOID TUMOR OF THE BREAST. I regret that the operation was not performed in the following case, as I think it would have had a fair chance of success:â€” Mrs. Davis, aged 50, perceived a small tumor in the breast, in March, 1817. It gradually increased until October, but as she suffered no pain, little notice was taken of it. In that month she consulted me.

A week after the puncture, a fungus protruded, and increased to a very considerable size, covering the edges of the wound over a large part of the breast, and measuring several inches in circumference. Nothing did good, and her health gra- p

DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. 75 was not in its proper situation ; the limb was shortened, and somewhat inverted, presenting just the appearance of a dislocation into the ischiatic notch. Moderate extension however, easily brought the leg of equal length with the other, and the whole limb to a natural state. He had retention of urine. The next day the limb was found again shortened, and although there was great swelling from the violent contusion which so heavy a body had occasioned, an accurate examination satisfied me that the head of the bone was still lying on the dorsum of the ilium. I was not present when the dislo- cation was reduced, but the surgeons who attended the patient were positive that they heard the bone return to its socket, and their opinion was confirmed by the patient and the bystanders. A careful examination was again made, when a fracture of the acetabulum was detected, which allowed the head of the bone to escape, and explained at once the cause of the limb presenting such different appearances. There was not the slightest diffi- culty in returning the bone to its natural position, but it was no easy matter to keep it there. This, however, was effected by fixing the pelvis, and keeping up permanent extension by means of a pulley. By persevering in this plan for several weeks, the patient perfectly recovered the use of the limb. I have frequently employed permanent extension by the pulley, in cases of very oblique or complicated fractures of the thigh, with the best effects; and particularly in one I attended about a year since, in which the shaft of the bone was broken in three different places, so that it was impossible to keep the limb right in any other way. The patient has an excellent limb, without any deformity. CASE OF NECROSIS OF THE FEMUR. William Cull, a farm labourer, aged forty, was admitted into the Bridgwater Infirmary for disease of the thigh-bone. The limb was more than double its natural size, the integuments were

. ANATOMY OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX 9 is that the secretions of its glands have the same chemical action and physiological results as the secretions of the same glands in the caecum. The probability is that in addition to the functions just mentioned its contents when poured into the caecum help to keep the contents of the caecum fluid at that situation and prevent them becoming septic, and also assist in digestion ; but the part played by it as compared with the caecum in this process must be very small under normal condi- tions. Beyond having referred to the folds of the peritoneum forming the Ccecal fossae I shall not go into the various small folds and fossje about the appendix for the purpose of this paper. Abnormally or pathologically the appendix may be found pointing in almost any position within the pelvis or abdomen; in this respect its range is a wide one, or it may be found buried in or adherent to the walls of these fossae. Its usual position is behind the ctecum, although it is sometimes found at the inner side of it, the outer side of it, or even in front of it. The colour of the appendix will depend partly upon its contents and the amount of blood within it at the time â€”its surface is smooth and glistening, and it is of varying consistence and rigidity in different subjects. Appendicular peristalsis resembles peristalsis in the intestines except that as it is closed at one end, its contents under normal condi- tions can only move in one direction. When the caecum is congenitally malformed or deficient, or the position of the appendix is altered from any cause, the appendix may be

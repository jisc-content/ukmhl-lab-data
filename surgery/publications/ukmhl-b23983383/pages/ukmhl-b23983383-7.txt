PREFACE. In presenting this short work on Appendicitis it is hoped that it may prove of some practical use, especially to those who for various reasons are not able to make a special study of this disease, nor have time to read fully the larger works published by different authors in this Country, in Europe and in America on this subject. It is hoped by the Author that by reference to these pages many enquirers may find practical hints which may materially assist them in the conduct of a given case. F. G. LLOYD. 27, Russell Road, Kensington, London, W., February, 1904.

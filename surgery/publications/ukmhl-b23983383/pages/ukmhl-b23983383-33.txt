AMPUTATION OK THE AI'PliNUlX 2^ T will now describe the method recommended by most authorities. The appendix should be clamped three-quarters of an inch from its base. The first incision should be made through the serous and part of the muscular coat ; this is turned back and the remainder is cut through after being clamped; the stump is then touched with a wooden match dipped in carbolic acid or the actual cautery or the galvano- cautery; the clamp is then released and the flap turned over it. It is then sewn up. First of all the mucous and muscular coats and then the serous coats by Lembert's method. A little graft of omentum may be placed over this. If the ba,se of the appendix and the portion of the caecum are gangrenous, this portion of the caecum with the appendix should be "cut out," the walls of the ca?cum should then be slightly turned in and sewn up by Lembert's suture. Extravasation may frequently be prevented by closing the orifice before amputating, either by a purse string suture or by a clamp. If the base of the appendix is fairly healthy, but the appendix is sloughing or gangrenous, it should be tied with catgut and nipped off with the scissors. An india-rubber tube of large size is then passed to the bottom of the cavity (some surgeons prefer two tubes) in suppurative cases, and in " non-suppurative " cases the wound is closed. The cavity in suppurating cases is probably best drained by suction, i.e., passing a smaller tube attached to a syringe to the bottom of the largei- one and then drawing off the contents and repeating the proceeding at each dressing, com- l)ined with the careful placing of strips of gauze.

(1) That as appendicitis is essentially protean and as the more serious cases cannot be anticipated, it would not be wise to open the abdomen in all cases of appendicitis simply on the possibility of their becoming of the ultra-acute variety. The statistics of many thousands of cases in hospital and private practice, both in Europe and America, prove to us that the large majority of cases recover without operation and without acute septic peritonitis. I am well aware that the time has not yet arrived to be dogmatic on this subject. (2) The exploring syringe has been used with considerable success in America, but in the ultra-acute cases, owing to the usual septic condition of the parts and the depth of tissue, as well as to the possibility of missing the pus, a laparotomy would appear preferable and is usually practised in this country. The exploring sj'ringe is no doubt of use in a few cases. (3) In a paper published by me in the Lancet, September 21, 190T, I advocated that in addition to making the counter opening in the loin, or in the female behind the cervix uteri for purposes of efficient drainage, I was of opinion that aspira- tion, or a small counter opening per rectum when the pus was collected in this locality, was in suitable cases of value. vSince that time I have had the pleasure of reading in this Society's Journal that the peritoneum had been successfully

PATHOLOGY OF APPENDICITIS Dr.^ C. Addison and lo by Dr. Keith it was found that in 22 instances the valve was situated under or near Munroe's point, in 14 instances above and on the average external to that point, and in 14 instances below and internal to that point. We thus see that McBurney's and Munroe's points are most interesting, as being situated at a point closely corresponding to the middle of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Tenderness at or about McBurney's point is, according to Sir Frederick Treves, common in colitis affecting the cÂ£ecum and also other pathological conditions affecting that portion of the great intestine.' It will be remembered that the ileo-cjecal valve has an elaborate nerve supply (like most other orifices of the body) from the eleventh and twelfth dorsal nerves, and that the bowel, the abdominal wall and the skin, are all supplied by the eleventh dorsal.* So that we see that in inflammation giving rise to pressure and tension from within pain may be evolved, as M-ell as from pressure from without, directly over McBurney's point, according to the structures which this pressure implicates and which are situated in the right iliac fossa. PATHOLOGY. Disease of the appendix vermiformis is very common and morbid changes are met with in about 20 per cent, of all bodies examined -post mortem. Appendicitis may originate from local or constitutional causes : (i) It may originate from causes within the lumen ; this I venture * Dr. Arthur Keith.

lO â€¢ ANATOMY OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX found to point in the direction of any one of the points of the compass, ^t}-"! and at times has been found adherent lo almost any of the structures within the abdomen or pelvis. Under normal conditions no solid or foreign body can enter the appendix, as its orifice, although varj/ing in size somewhat in different individuals, is not wide and it is protected by its nervous mechanism and the movement of its valve, which probably acts more or less as a " sphincter," so far as entrance into the tube is concerned, but when this resistance is interfered with or overcome from mechanical or pathological causes, then gas, liquid, or solid may enter the tube from the caecuin as well as being at times formed within it. When there is no obstruction the tube empties its contents into the contents of the ca;cum at its orifice, be they liquid (as the}^ usually are) or partially liquid, partially solid, or partially gaseous. The contents of the caecum and appendix after death may be influenced by the cause of death as well as by the nature of the food ingested. It is possible that if it was not for the help given by the appendix in this situation that the con- tents of the caecum and ascending colon would have a tendency to solidify sooner than nature intended, but as in the case of the tonsil its presence does not seem imperative. The topographical situation of the appendix vermiformis necessarily varies both in health and in disease, but generally the opening of the appendix into the caecum is to be found about one inch below the point known as " McBurney's point."

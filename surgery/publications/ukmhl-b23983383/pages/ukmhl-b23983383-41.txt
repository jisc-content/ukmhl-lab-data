37 CONCLUSIONS hoisted on the shoulders of their ancestors. I beHeve appen- dicitis by coincidence is sometimes ei)idemic, that it often runs in famihes, that it is much more frequent in the male than in the female, and that it is commonest during the first half of life and during the hot weather, especially in tropical climates. I do not know why one person should develop appendicitis whilst another person taking exactly the same risks does not do so. and I cannot tell why an appendix eight inches in length lying in a left inguinal hernia of ten years' duration, or in other cases abscess around the Ccecum, should be latent, or give rise to no symptoms during life, but this is sometimes the case. In preparing this paper I am much indebted to the works of Dr. Pye Smith, Sir Frederick Treves, the late Mr. Walsham, Mr. Lockwood, Dr. Kelynack, Dr. Deaver, Dr. Osier, and to some kind suggestions from Mr. C. B. Keetley, my brother, Mr. Rickard W. Lloyd, Col. C. E. Harrison, and Dr. T. J. Dyall ; also to some specimens of appendicitis at the Royal College of Surgeons, London, and the Museum of St. Bar- tholomew's Hospital, and elsewhere, and to some interesting cases which came under my care and observation at the Guard's Hospital, London, in South Africa during the late war, and in general practice.

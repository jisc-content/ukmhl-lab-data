COURSE AND IJROGNOSIS 22 from seven days to three weeks. The variety of abscess with strictly local peritonitis when surgically treated offers a favourable prognosis. Operation should not as a rule be undertaken hastily, but each case should be treated on its individual merits, even when very acute physical signs and symptoms are present. Peace and rest should be encouraged within the abdomen both before and after operation. When the peritonitis is general, prompt action is needed, and except in the early stages, radical measures which will be described under treatment are imperative. In about 8 per cent, of cases pus enters the peritoneal cavity by dissecting between the layers of the meso-appendix. During the progress of the disease, especially in the more serious varieties of appendicitis, general toxccmic symptoms are present M'ith frequently evidence of secondary infection. Acetonjemia and nephritis are sometimes to be demon- strated. There is also evidence in some cases of pathological changes and secondary abscesses in other organs. Appendi- citis co-existent with another disease, such as typhoid, dysen- tery, or tubercle, will usually have its symptoms somewhat masked by the greater invasion.

A condition resembling acute yellow atrophy of the liver of septic origin is sometimes present in the later stages of the ultra-acute variety, but this is probably only part of the

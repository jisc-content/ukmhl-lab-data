CONDITION OF THE APPENDIX CONDITION OF THE APPENDIX. An abscess associated with appendicitis may be found to have tracked in any of the following directions : (i) Into the cellular tissue; (2) into the ccecum ; (3) into the abdominal wall ; (4) into the rectum ; (5) into the uterus or its appen- dages ; (6) into the bladder ; (7) into the peritoneal cavity, either direct or after being first of all an abscess, with strictly local peritonitis and otherwise shut off from the general peri- toneal cavity ; (8) through the sheath of the psoas muscle or opening up the iliac vessels ; (9) through the sciatic or obturator foraminse or through one of the abdominal rings ; or (10) in the so-called extraperitoneal variety, that is, with strictly local peritonitis it may burrow up behind the colon and perforate the diaphragm, giving rise directly to pleurisy, pneumonia, or pericarditis. There is an intimate sympathy existing between the various synovial cavities and the peritoneum, and this is regulated by means of the blood, lymphatic and nervous centres controlling them. In appendicitis with perforation into the general peri- toneal cavity there is a tendency for the pus to gravitate to the most dependent positions (i.e., into Douglas's pouch or into the recto-vesical pouch). In this variety the false as well as the true ligaments of the bladder are frequently involved. The appendix may be (Â«) twisted upon itself or kinked, giving rise to mucocele, empyema, gangrene or perforation ; (fi) it may be the seat of one or more strictures, or may be

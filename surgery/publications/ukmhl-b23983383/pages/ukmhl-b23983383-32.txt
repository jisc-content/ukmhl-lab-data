28 AMPUTATION Ol- THE APPENDIX should be performed on a hot water bed or table. Time must not be wasted during the operation. Subcutaneous injection of strychnine and brandy injections per rectum should be administered. The decision of the surgeon as to prolonging an operation in a given case must depend on the condition of the patient at the time and cannot be decided by rule. Each case must be treated according to the conditions found on exploration. There are other authorities who even in this variety advocate a simple incision and drainage by one of the usual methods, hoping for the best and trusting to the self-pre- serving and resisting power of the tissues. No doubt in many cases, owing to the condition of the patient, this is all that it is advisable to attempt. Amputation of the appendix in these cases is sometimes easy and sometimes difficult or impossible, on account of extensive adhesions. When a second or third incision has to be made, the first should be closed with gauze and collodion flexile after sewing up. AMPUTATION OF THE APPENDIX. There are many methods for removing the appendix vermi- formis, according to the extent of the inflammation. It is quite probable that when the base of the appendix is in a fairly healthy condition that tying it with a simple catgut ligatvire and snipping it off would have the desired effect. But when the appendix is septic or the caecum is in a state of very low vitality or gangrenous, then special methods must be adopted.

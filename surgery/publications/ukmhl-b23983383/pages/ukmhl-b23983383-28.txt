24 TREATMENT OF APPENDICITIS as an injection of morphia (i of a grain) or in the form of the Uquor sedativus (lo minims twice in the day), according to the amount of the distress. Opium in these cases is a very vahiable friend, but a dangerous friend, and must be given with care, the physical signs and symptoms being carefully watched. If the symptoms are very acute no food should be given by the mouth, except a few spoon- fiils of milk (peptonised) or a little hot water or weak tea to relieve thirst, the patient being fed by rectal enema. No aperient should be given by the mouth at this stage for obvious reasons. In acute cases the treatment should correspond to that for "acute peritonitis." Many prefer to add a little antiseptic by the mouth, say " salol," lo grains twice or three times in the twentj^-four hours if the bowels are acting. It is very doubtful whether suf- ficient antiseptic can safely be given hy the mouth in appendicitis without being harmful to the patient. On this account many authorities prefer not to attempt this method. If stimulants are indicated they must be given. They are probably best given either in the form of brandy, whisky or (iced ?) champagne, to be sipped slo\vl3^ or administered per rectum, or by hypodermic injection, the patient being fed by the rectum. Cases of acute, chronic, relapsing, or latent appendicitis are best treated in this way, unless ultra-acute symptoms or special symptoms have presented themselves. It must be remembered that after repeated attacks recovery may be perfect, and that in any case the operation is best per- formed in the quiescent stage where possible.

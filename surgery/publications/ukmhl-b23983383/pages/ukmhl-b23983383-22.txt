There are three cardinal symptoms (i) pain, (2) tenderness (superficial and deep), (3) rigidity ; and two others are usually present, viz., fever and constipation. The intensity of the symptoms varies somewhat with the degree and variety of the inflammation, as in other parts, as well as to the structure implicated, unless the sensibihty of the nerves of these structures has been destroyed or paralysed from inflammation, pressure, or tension. The pulse may be considered as a far more reliable guide than the temperature in this disease. In diagnosis, the questions that present themselves are three in number : (i) Is this a case of appendicitis ? (2) What is the probable condition of the appendix ? (3) What degree or variety of appendicitis is it ? With regard to the first of these questions, the following diseases may have to be excluded by differential diagnosis, each condition mentioned having a specific history and cardinal symptoms of its own : {a) Colic—intestinal, renal, hepatic, pancreatic, and splenic ; (b) obstruction—acute strangvdated intestine, or pseudo-strangulation, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract, other than appendicitis, hema- tocele, parasites and worms ; (c) if fever is present, typhoid fever and pneumonia before consolidation ; (d) intussuscep- tion or hip-joint disease in children ; {e) a distended gall- bladder ; (/) simple or specific inflammation of colon, the caecum, or the ileum. In the chronic and relapsing varieties of appendicitis the

CAUSES OF APPENDICITIS 17 Concretions within the tube are commonl}/ made up of phosphate of Ume, carbonate of lime, of magnesium, bile salts, and organic matter mixed with faeces and teeming with mixed bacteria. They are of varying consistence. The nucleus is usually a hardened mass of organic matter, fceces and bac- teria, often concentrically arranged, although occasionally it is a foreign body which has entered at the mouth of the tube or been forced through its wall, such as small pips, pins, shot, bits of bone, &c. The salts of the nucleus are often a deposit from a catarrhal exudation, as in the tonsil and nose, mixed with organic matter and bacteria, \vhilst the appendix is in a state of inflammation. It is probable that in a patient predispose'! to an attack of appendicitis that movement of any kind will help to aggra- vate a local condition, and if appendicitis is present, that violent muscular movements from any cause may prove the immediate and exciting cause of rupture. This fact may account for the disease being commoner in the male than in the female, and in the young and active rather than in those past middle life. The worms and parasites found present are the usual varieties which infest the intestine of man. Rheumatism or gout sometimes invade the appendix vermi- formis, but I venture to think they are very rare. Simple colic of the tube, or neuromimesis, or a pyfemic, saprosmic or septicfemic condition of the tube, or muscular rheumatism of the abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, are probably commoner. In pregnancy inflam- mation of the right appendages closely simulate a mild attack of appendicitis.

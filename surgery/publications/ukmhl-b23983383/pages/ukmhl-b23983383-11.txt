7 ANATOMY OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX It usually opens into the cjecum at its most dependent part and it is an intraperitoneal organ. Its diameter is on an average about one quarter of an inch and rather less in females. Its average length is about three to five inches, although in some cases it may be as short as two, or as long as eight inches, or even longer. It is composed of four coats, serous, muscular, sub-mucous, and mucous, and in a normal state has a lumen running from its proximal end to its distal end. The distal end is free to a varying extent. Its meso- appendix is of varying length and shape, but usually ter- minates at about one quarter to three quarters of an inch from the distal end. The various folds of peritoneum about the appendix and cÂ£ECum make up what are known as : (i) The sub-Ccecal fossa ; (2) the ileo-caecal fossae, and (3) the ileo-colic fossa, which fossae are situated very closely where their names would indicate. The appendix in health is more or less elastic in the living subject and is under certain conditions found in most unex- pected places. Under normal conditions it will move with the caecum as well as within the more limited scope of its meso-appendix. This little body resembles in structure the structure of the caecum and has blood-vessels, nerves, lym- phatics, veins and glands; the latter lining its mucous mem- brane, are known as Lieberkuhn's follicles. It is possessed of peristaltic action, and at its opening into the caecum is protected by a more or less incomplete valve formed by the folding of the mucous membranes at that point, and this is known as Gerlach's valve. In structure it resembles the tonsil in the large amount

AMPUTATION OF THE APPENDIX 3° by suction has the disadvantage of making us considerably ' dependent on other people. All tubes, syringes, &c., should be kept in carbolic solution of i in 20. The after-treat- ment is similar to the after-treatment of other abdominal operations, except that in the gangrenous and perforative varieties of appendicitis with peritonitis, the cavity is diffi- cult to efficiently drain, and irrigation must be almost limited to cleansing of the tube and the superficial parts. When gauze only is used this should be loosened by a few drops of warm water at each dressing. The sinuses and fistulte remaining in these cases exhibit a tendency to close spontaneously in time, but are usually very slow and difficult to heal. If the skin is allowed to heal too quickly or if they do not heal from the bottom after '■fair trial," explore and refresh the edges of the sinus or the sinuses, at the same time cutting through any adhesions that may be necessary. There are a few cases on record where enterostomy or even the cutting out the caecum or other portions of the intestine become necessary. The appendix should be removed during a quiescent period for preference, but when an abscess is diagnosed it is safer to operate at once. There is no fixed day for operation ; but too early and too late operations are to be avoided. Operation or explora- tion are seldom called for before the third day and then only if the symptoms are progressive. In the relapsing variety of appendicitis we cannot be guided by rule alone, but operation is perhaps best per- formed after the first or second, or third attack, in the

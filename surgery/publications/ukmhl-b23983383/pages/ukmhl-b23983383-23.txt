SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS 19 following diseases more or less simulate appendicitis : tuber- culosis of the ceecum, cancer of the Ccecum, large gall-stones or enteroliths within the CcTCuin or ileum, psoas abscess, peri- nephritic abscess, diseases of the uterus, ovaries or Fallopian tubes and hip-joint disease, and also pseudo-swellings. The following considerations may help us in our diagnosis : the seat of pain ; the occupation of the patient ; the history of the present illness ; past illnesses and environment ; the present condition, as evidenced by local pain, tenderness, rigidity, the cachexia of the patient, facial expression, pulse, tongue, temperature, respirations, the catamenia, the urine, the stool, the vomit and the expectoration ; auscultation of the abdomen and chest ; the use of the exploring needle ; leucoc^'tosis, and laparotomy. In doubtful cases an examination should always be made per rectum and in the female per vaginam, and with great care, bimanually. The presence or absence of a definite swelling in appendicitis is very unreliable and depends amongst other things upon the position of the appendix at the time. Another point of great importance is the fact that in " per- foration " due to " appendicitis " the signs of collapse appear slowly and the progress is comparatively slower than in perforation of other portions of intestine. Generally, but not always, in appendicitis signs of complete obstruction appear late and peritonitis appears early. This fact is impor- tant in diagnosing between it and the complete intestinal obstruction of other parts due to adhesions and bands, &c. In connection with the second question, "What is the

A FEW SPECIAL CASES 3^ (luicscent period for preference, unless ultra-acute symptoms suddenly Supervene, in which case operative measures should be undertaken at once. I will now proceed to relate a few cases to illustrate some of my points, which cases have come under my care in hospital and private practice. Case I.—A. R., aged 25, seized with sudden pain in the abdomen, but specially about umbilicus over the region of the stomach and right lower quadrant of the belly. Tongue furred but moist, temperature 100° F., pulse no ; has not been sick but feels inclined to be so. Put to bed. Slop diet, mild saline aperient. Recipe ■ Mist, quininse, t.d.s.— salol 10 grs., three times in twenty-four hours. Next day he feels better, tongue, pulse, and temperature normal, local pain almost disappeared. Kept at rest four days longer, and then allowed to return to his work—well. Case 2.—C. D., admitted into hospital in apparently a more or less neuro-mimetric condition, complaining of general illness, great pain in the stomach, not strictly localised, vomiting, constipation and fever. A surgeon under whose care he was placed informed me that, the patient was very hysterical and seemed to have very little else serious the matter. Two days later I assisted at his post-mortem examination. It was a case of the ultra-acute perforating variety of appendicitis with gangrene, and abscess discharging into the general peritoneal cavity and with general septic peri- tonitis ; a fsecal concretion and perforation were found in the appendix.

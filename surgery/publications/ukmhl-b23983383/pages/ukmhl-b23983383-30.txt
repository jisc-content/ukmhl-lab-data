OPERATIVE MEASURES 26 exists. The number of sponges and pieces of gauze in use must be carefully counted, both before and after an operation. In operating, after opening the peritoneum, probably the shortest guide to the appendix, whatever its position, is the anterior longitudinal band on the front of the caecum, but ver}^ often when searching for it the surgeon's finger is even more useful. It is unnecessary to state that the intestines and adhe- sions should always be handled very gently, and with the greatest care, but if in spite of this a slight tear should occur, say in the caecum, it should be immediately sewn up. In early acute septic inflammation without suppuration an incision should be made and the appendix removed, and there should be a thorough sponging awa}^ of all septic material. There are three varieties of abscess of the appendix, viz., (i) with strictly local peritonitis in which the pus is discharged outside the general peritoneal cavity ; (2) involv- ing more and more of the peritoneum, but still shut off from the general peritoneal cavity by adhesions ; (3) discharging directly into the peritoneal cavity or else, after being of the so-called extraperitoneal variety then entering the general peritoneal cavity. The first two varieties should be cut down upon, and evacuated and drained efficiently, taking great care not to break down new and delicate adhesions. If in either of these varieties whilst operating the appendix is presenting itself in the wound, or easily accessible by very gentle manipulation, tie it and remove it, but if not do not break down Nature's adhesions in searching for it during the

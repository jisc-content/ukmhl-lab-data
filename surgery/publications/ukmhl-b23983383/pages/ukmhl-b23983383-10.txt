G CLASSIFICATION OF APPENDICITIS ill-founded. Esi^ecially is this the case with regard to " treatment," where I express a leaning, as vou will see, towards the " conservative side." CLASSIFICATION OF APPENDICITIS. Appendicitis means inflammation of the vermiform appen- dix. It is to be distinguished from a similar condition of the C2ecum, known as "typhlitis," and the ileum, known as " ileitis." It is a disease which has its origin in the ver- miform appendix, but occasionally exists as a complication of typhlitis or perityphlitis by extension, or through the vascular or lymphatic system. Appendicitis may be divided into the following varieties, which differ from one another rather in degree than in kind, and correspond with the degrees of inflammation to be met with in other parts. (1) Acute Appendicitis, with or without inflammation of the peritoneum, {a) ending in resolution ; (b) ending in sup- puration, ulceration, or abscess ; (c) ending in gangrene : (d) ending in perforation. (2) Chronic Appendicitis. (3) Relapsing- Appendicitis. (4) Latent Appendicitis. GROSS ANATOMY. The vermiform appendix is a tube closed at one end and opening into the caecum at the other. It has, like other portions of the intestinal canal, a mesentery, known as the meso-appendix.

CONXLUSIONS 35 washed out and drained per rectum, in some cases of ultra- acute appendicitis, in America. There are also some recorded cases of simple appendicular abscess successfully treated by way of the rectum. I was prompted to make the suggestion after repeated experiments in the deadhouse, and owing to the difficulty I experienced in draining successfully in these ultra-acute cases. (4) It is well to remember in making incisions when peritonitis is present : {a) That the peritoneum is injected or of a dull red colour, and is often as much as half an inch in thickness. (6) That adhesions are best divided and not torn through, (c) That the visceral and parietal layers of peritoneum are usually adherent, {d) That the small intes- tines are often glued together and if opened by accident they should be united by Lembert's sutures, {e) That the bladder is sometimes dilated and adherent. (/) That each piece of omentum is best transfixed and tied at both ends, [g) That if the whole appendix cannot be removed owing to adhesions, try and dissect away part of it, if you have decided to attempt removal. (//) That the amount of pus present in perforation cases varies from a few drachms or ounces in the direct perfor- ating variety to as much as a couple of pints or even quarts. (5) That 70 per cent, of cases of appendicitis get well on careful medicinal treatment alone, and that although a new- set of false teeth and regular and careful attention to diges- tion, to the bowels and to diet, have warded off relapse, that gangrenous appendicitis may occur in upwards of 15 per cent, of cases.

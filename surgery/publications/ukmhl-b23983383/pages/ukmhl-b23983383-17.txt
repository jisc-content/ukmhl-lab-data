13 INFLAMMATION OF THE APPENDIX to think is by far the commonest ; (2) from causes within the wall of the tube or aiTiving through its vascular, lymphatic, or nervous supply ; (3) from causes outside the tube by injury, pressure, or extension of inflammation. INFLAMMATION. It would seem to depend on one of three causes, namely :â€” (1) Lowering of the vitality of the tube from any cause giving rise to deficiency of normal resisting power to bacilli, cocci and mixed infection. (2) The number, virulence and specific kind of bacteria present. (3) The capability of the walls of the tube to expel its contents into the caecum. Bacteria are always found present in the gastro-intestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, but except under altered pathological conditions give rise to no pathological signs or symptoms. These bacteria are not present in the foetal appendix, but are usually found present in a normal appendix after birth. They probably assist digestion in the process of fermentation. The vermiform appendix may be found in part or along its whole length in one of the following conditions of inflam- mation : (i) confined to the surface of the lumen ; (2) involving one or more of its coats ; (3) perforating its peritoneal coat or dissecting between the layers of its mesentery. The inflam- mation present may be of the simple, specific, or malignant variety.

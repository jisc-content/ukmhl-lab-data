OPERATIVE MEASURES 25 OPERATIVE MEASURES. The large majority of cases of appendicitis require no " operative" treatment. In ultra-acute cases, with gangrene or abscess, laparotomy should be performed early. Operations for appendicitis do not differ in principle from other antiseptic or aseptic operations on the abdomen. Suppurative appendicitis, whether intra- or so-called extra- peritoneal, call for immediate operative interference. The term extraperitoneal appendicitis is not strictly correct, except when the inflammation is limited to the lumen and coats of the tube ; but by it I mean when the peritonitis is strictly local and the general peritoneal cavity is not involved, or is sh\it off by adhesions. In all cases of appendicitis Nature endeavours to localise and to limit the mischief by throwing up adhesions. In the so-called extraperitoneal variety the incision should be made as low as possible so as to avoid open- ing the general peritoneum, i.e., half an inch above Poupart's ligament along the outer half, according to the point of maximum dulness and resistance, which may be decided upon after the patient is under the anjesthetic. During the incision in the non-suppurative variety the muscular fibres are best separated by McBurney's method for preference (that is, separating each muscle in the direction of its fibres). In this variety many prefer the incision through the linear semilunaris along the outer border of the rectus muscle. Appendicitis with intraperitoneal mischief and general septic peritonitis requires very careful packing and sponging, so as to try to prevent more septic extravasation than already

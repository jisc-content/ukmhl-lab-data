CONDITION OF THE APPENDIX 15 partially or completely obliterated from old inflammation or ulceration, or (c) it may constitute an intussusception (it may even be found completely invaginated), or may constitute a hernia, or part of a hernia, partial or complete, of one of the following varieties : inguinal, femoral, ventral, obturator, or umbilical; (d) it may be considerably elongated and lying in one of the following positions : (i) over the pelvic brim ; (2) adhering to the abdominal wall or to almost any structure within the abdomen, for instance, the gall bladder, Meckel's diverticulum, duodenum, or may be buried in the wall of, or intussuscepted into, the caecum ; (e) it may be the seat of embolus, thrombosis, tubercle, papilloma, sarcoma, carcinoma (primary or secondary), or of primary or secondary deposits of actinomycosis, or again of parasites or worms. Secondary deposits and degenera- tions are commoner than primary growths of the appendix. The tendency of any of these conditions is to more or less obliterate the appendix. In suppurative appendicitis, with perforation and acute diffuse septic peritonitis, the pus is very rarely found to extend higher than the transverse meso-colon. Appendicitis may terminate in resolution, complex adhe- sions, suppuration (local or general), or gangrene, with or without perforation. The termination of the suppurative or gangrenous varieties after operation may be (i) resolution ; (2) recovery with adhesions; (3) fistulce ; (4) death from (i.) pytemia, or toxae- mia, (ii.) intestinal obstruction, (iii.) lardaceous disease, (iv.) acute yellow atrophy of the liver, (v.) exhaustion.

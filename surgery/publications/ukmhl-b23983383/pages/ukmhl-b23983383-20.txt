CAUSES OF APPENDICITIS i6 BACTERIOLOGY. Inflammation of the vermiform appendix is probably always due to bacteria. It is usually the "result of a mixed infection and invasion from within its lumen whilst it is in a predisposed condition. The Bacillus colt communis is constant, but except in diseased or damaged tissues, or tissues whose vitality is lowered, its action is probably aseptic rather than septic. This bacillus is largely in excess of any other variety found present, and is frequently the only bacillus to be found present. In disease of the appendix the following additional varieties have been demonstrated : cocci, micrococci, strepto- cocci, staphylococci, diplococci, pneumococcic bacilh, tubercle bacilU, leptothrix, saccharomyces, and some others.* CAUSES. The causes of appendicitis may be simple, specific, or malignant. The exciting causes are numerous. Some of the commonest may be classified as indigestion, arising from any of the usual causes, cold, injury, foreign bodies, concretions, constipation (giving rise to pressure and tension, and to chemical irritation within the tube, thus lowering the vitality of the wall of the tube at that part, and becoming the seat of invasion of the bacterium), diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoidal and tubercular causes, and malignant ulceration (primary and secondary). * Javel and Lanz, Leipzig, 1893.

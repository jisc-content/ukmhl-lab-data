ANATOMY OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX 8 of lymphoid tissue distributed in its sub-mucous coat. This tissue, when present, probably serves to help in protecting the part from bacterial invasion. The appendix vermiformis is frequently slightly curved, twisted or sinuous, depending upon its contents at the time and the tension of its meso- appendix. Running upwards and backwards from a point about one inch below the ileo-CcCcal valve and then pointing sharply upwards and towards the spleen is its usual direction, but this again will vary with its contents, the tension of its mesentery, as also with the contents and position of the Ccecum at a given time. Another common direction is slightly curved, but pointing directly upwards, or another lying across the brim of the pelvis. The appendix vermiformis is the remains of the true caecum and as an appendix is present in " man." certain of the "anthropoid apes" and in the "wombat." and in comparative anatom}' is about midway between the " herbivora " and the " carnivora." Its function is not at present entirely known, but the blood-vessels, lymphatics and nerves, and the peristaltic activity, have in all probability the same function as those of the caecum adjoining it, and it serves to secrete a varying amount of mucus. Under normal conditions it is probably almost functionless. It is probably the remains of a more or less incomplete effort of nature to close the caecum at that situation, the result of this atrophy being this little cul-de-sac of varying length, mobility and consistence. There is little doubt but that the function of the appendix vermiformis is secretive, excretive and absorptive, that within its lumen a certain amount of formation of gas takes place and the probability

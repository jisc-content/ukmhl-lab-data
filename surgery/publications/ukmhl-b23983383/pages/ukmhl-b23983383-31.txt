27 OPERATIVE MEASURES acute stage. It will either slough away or become obliterated after efficient drainage and rest. The third and most fatal variety occurs often after a few days' delay or when the peritonitis is very acute from the first, and is probably best treated by the radical method recommended b}' the late Mr. Walsham in his excellent work on appendicitis, and which operation I will now proceed to describe. An incision is made over the seat of the appendix and is removed. An incision is then made at a point midway between the ensiform cartilage and the umbilicus and carried as far as the pubes. The intestines are then turned out and cleaned, being kept by an assistant at the body tempera- ture by the application of hot sterilised towels. With the intestines thus turned out the peritoneum can be thoroughly flushed and sponged free from all pus and extravasated fluid, especial attention being paid to the recto-vesical pouch, Douglas's pouch, and other cul-de-sacs of the abdominal cavity. When every visible particle of septic material has been removed we have next to deal with the intestines. When they have been flushed and sponged, incisions should be made into the distended coils in sufficient number to empty them of gas and liquid fteces and the peritoneum should then be united by Lembert's method. The intestines are then returned into the abdomen, and a drainage tube is inserted at the lower part and the abdo- minal wall is sewn up with silkworm gut. Shock should be counteracted by the usual methods as far as possible, i.e., the limbs should be wrapped in cotton wool and the operation

ANATOMY OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX II Before leaving the anatomy of the appendix, just a word with regard to " McBurnej^'s " point and " Munroe's " point. If a Hne be drawn from the anterior superior spine of the ileum to the umbilicus (which line is usually about six inches in length in the adult), it will be found that along this line are situated the points generally known as " McBurney's " point and "Munroe's" point. The former is situated about one and a half to two inches along this line and is a more exact point than Munroe's point, which is situated beneath the outer border of the rectus muscle. To quote Dr. McBurney's own words on this subject he says. " I beheve that in every case (of appendicitis) the seat of greatest pain, determined by the pressure of one finger, has been very exactly between one inch and a half and two inches from the anterior spinous process of the ileum in a straight line drawn from that process to the umbilicus. This point corresponds very accurately in the living subject to the base of the appendix." The point at which the spino- unibilical line crosses the outer edge of the rectus muscle is called Munroe's point. The ureter crosses the spino-umbilical line at the point of junction of its inner and middle thirds. The genito-' crural nerve is close to it. The eleventh dorsal nerve enters the sheath of the rectus beneath Munroe's point. The structure on the right side, which comes more directly under McBurney's point or Munroe's point, is the ileo-caecal valve and not the base of the appendix. The base of the appendix is usually rather more than an inch below the opening of the ileo-ceecal valve. In 40 cases recorded and figured by

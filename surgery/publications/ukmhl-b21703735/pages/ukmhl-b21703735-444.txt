360 A CLINICAL STUDY OF FIFTY CASES OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. Idiopathic Muscular Atrophy, Myopathy, by joseph collins, m.d. Professor of Nervous and Mental Diseases at the New York Post- Graduate Medical School and Hospital. AND H. CLIMENKO, M.D. Instructor in the Department of Nervous and Mental Diseases at the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. General Considerations.â€”There is a form of muscular disease or "myopathy.", attended in the main by wasting, that is called dystrophy. The essential disease proper is supposed to be of the muscle itself, but it is as yet undetermined what constituent of the muscle is first attacked. The disease-process finally involves them all, and before its activity ceases all the com- ponents of the muscles disappear. It is to be distinguished from progressive muscular atrophy of spinal origin, that is atrophy the result of disease of the cells of the anterior horns of the spinal cord; from atrophy of neural origin, that is from disease of the motor nerves, and from atrophy of myositic origin by careful study and observation which will usually show that muscular dystrophy has the following more or less constant and characteristic features: 1. Onset in early life. (Infantile and juvenile types to be considered later.) 2. Its occurrence in more than one member of a family, and occasionally as a direct inheritance. 3. The involvement in some instances of a particular portion of the body (Facio-scapulo-humeral and distal types to be con- sidered later), and in other instances the manifestations of the disease in muscles that do not correspond to the distribution of a single motor nerve or functionally associated motor nerves, or to the distribution of motor nerves from a spinal segment. 4. The absence clinically of the following phenomena which occur in other forms of progressive muscular atrophy: (a)

198 CARCINOMA OF THE HEART. somewhat into the right auricle. The primary growth was in the mediastinum. Ebstein,23 in 1866, had a patient, aged 58, with a carcinoma in the esophagus. In the musculature of the left ventricle was a nodule the size of a walnut. Prudhomme,24 in 1867, reported a tumor of the heart which he thought was primary, but no microscopic examination was made. Morgan,23 in 1868, reported a primary carcinoma of the thy- roid. There were nodules in the myocardium and pericardium. Carcinomatous thrombi were found in the heart. Lober,28 in 1875, reported a carcinoma of the testicle, with secondary growths in the bladder and kidneys. There was a nodule in the right ventricle at the septum. An embolus, con- taining carcinoma cells, was present in the pulmonary artery. Besides the cases described by Boether, there are records of other cases which are briefly mentioned here. Fletcher,27 in 1850, described a\case with many secondary deposits in the heart and left pleural cavity. Wilks28 found secondary tumor masses in the base of the heart, in 1854. Sibley,29 in 1857, reported a case of encephaloid carcinoma of the right lung, which involved the heart. Moxon,30 in 1867, found a secondary carcinoma of the heart in a case of carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Da Costa,31 in 1880, reported a case of secondary carcinoma of the heart resulting in cerebral embolism. Martinotti,32 in 1886, described a carcinoma of the heart with three metastatic nodules in the pericardium and four in the endocardium. Pic and Bret,5 in 1891, described a case, a woman 67 years of age, who had a carcinoma of the esophagus, involving the lower third. In the heart there was a large carcinomatous nodule, situated on the pericardial surface of the left ventricle. There were also numerous nodules in other parts of the heart. In another case, reported at the same time, the patient had stenosis of the esophagus for six months before death. At autopsy a carcinoma, 10 cm. long, was found occluding the esophagus and adherent to the trachea. An effort to separate the tissues produced a tear in the esophageal tunic. The heart showed a metastatic nodule on the pericardial surface of the left ventricle, and metastases were present also in the liver, spleen and pancreas. Hektoen,33 in 1893, reported a case of medullary carcinoma of the breast in a woman aged 50. The tumor had formed metastases in the lung, liver, Fallopian

388 SUPPURATIVE LESIONS OF THE PHARYNX. The pus in cases of the other types mentioned must be sought for at the most probable point in each instance, and it is in them that the following plan of approach is especially helpful, for not infrequently search for the pus with a bistoury is difficult, and may become dangerous. For this purpose a pair of long, slender, but strong, angular forceps is necessary, the narrow point of which is to be pushed into the tissue at the selected place. A rough sketch of a typical quinsy on the left side. The swollen uvula, u, is pushed over by the abscess in front and above the left tonsil. The line A to B indicates the extent and direction of the incision which will best serve the need for drainage in these cases. The blades of the forceps are then opened, by which a considerable tear can be made, through which the pus will drain. This method of opening the abscess may be used instead of the bistoury, even in the first type of the disease if circumstances make it desirable, but a better and cleaner incision results from the use of the knife in this region. The tear produced by the forceps, besides being easy to make, has less tendency to bleed than a knife cut. â–

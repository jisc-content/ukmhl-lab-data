115 BIOLOGY IN INFANT FEEDING. form of proteids and carbohydrates employed particularly be mentioned ? In practice there are used: Plain, fresh cow's milk " " " " diluted with water « « a « « « gruels " " " " " " " dextrinized Fresh cow's milk and lime water " " " " potassium carbonate " " " " sodium bicarbonate " " " " sodium citrate Cow's milk or cream with whey " " " " " and alkali Cow's milk and acids—precipitated milk Cow's milk and acid bacteria—precipitated milk and bacteria. In these different methods of furnishing cow's milk to infants, about seven different forms of proteids are employed; but this fact is not generally recognized and 'makes teaching highly empirical. The attempt at establishing a calorie basis of feeding exclu- sively is based on a mistaken idea. The -calorie is a measure of heat and energy. The infant is not a machine for princi- pally turning food into work. A certain amount of work it has to do in growing and in carrying on its bodily functions, but its great demand is for food that can be converted into body tissue. Condensed milk as often fed to infants has a high \~alue in calories because of the excess of sugar it contains. Condensed- milk babies are, as a rule, fat but poorly nourished; they have stored up calories as fat, but proper growth arid nutrition calls principally for storage of proteids and salts. SUMMARY. The details of the different manipulations required to make various milks acceptable to the infant's stomach constitute the art of infant feeding. . All these details, however, to be of lasting benefit, must be in accordance with biological laws, and, in a last analysis, biology will decide both the possibilities and limitations of every method that is advanced. It is the only lasting and authoritative standard to which we may bring all

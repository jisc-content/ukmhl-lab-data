60 BLADDER WOUNDS IN HERNIA OPERATIONS. which the protruding tumor sac is large and sessile, for with- out a neck the second procedure is impracticable. For the bladder wounds which have caused such a high mortality, a number of methods of closure are advocated. Dr. Howard A. Kelley* advocates catgut sutures through the entire thickness of the bladder, reinforced with a second row of fine silk sutures. He says: " I have experienced no trouble in tying catgut sutures in the bladder, and dropping them when it was easier to pass and tie the sutures at the base." In Dr. Wier's case, reported by Gibson, continuous catgut sutures were used in apposing the mucosa, and interrupted Lembert sutures of Fig. 6.â€”Suture in place to close the opening after inversion is complete. fine silk for the second tier. A catheter was kept in the urethra for three days. Chas. H. Mayo closes the bladder wounds with catgut protected on the outside by linen sutures of the Gushing type. Gibson advises tier sutures, with preference for silk, the bladder drained per urethra by a catheter for a few days in the intra-peritoneal wounds, and gauze packing to the bladder wound until its healing is assured. In my own case (see case histories) the silk sutures proved such an annoyance that I feel it would be better to take the risk of leakage from the too early absorption of * " Resections of the Bladder in Rebellious Cystitis," N.

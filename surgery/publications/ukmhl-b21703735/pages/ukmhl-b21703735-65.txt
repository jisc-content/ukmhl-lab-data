FIBROID DEGENERATION OF THE APPENDIX. 45 dition occurring with congestion of other abdominal organs, and even though the appendix is sometimes distended with serous infiltration to the point of becoming anemic, the conges- tive process takes place so slowly that protective factors seem to be called out, and there is little danger of these cases merging into Class 2. We find this type of appendix commonly asso- ciated with loose kidney, or in cases with abdominal ascites, for example. Class 4.â€”Appendicitis due to extrinsic infection is found in cases where such diseases as tuberculosis or cancer involve the appendix. In these cases also, we seem to have protection called out during the slow advance of the disease in such a way as to guard against attacks of acute infective appendicitis proper. In conclusion, I will repeat that appendicitis may practically be classified in four types, and that fibroid degeneration of the appendix presents the most common and on the whole the most important affection of the appendix, notwithstanding the fact that the phenomena of acute infective appendicitis just at present engage the attention of the profession to a greater degree. It is my belief further, that fibroid degeneration of the appendix protects the patient against acute infective ap- pendicitis, and that it accomplishes this in two ways. First, by removing the structures which would be chiefly engaged during acute infection processes, and second, by the persistent cell protection called out by irritated nerve filaments which are entrapped in the contracting connective tissue.

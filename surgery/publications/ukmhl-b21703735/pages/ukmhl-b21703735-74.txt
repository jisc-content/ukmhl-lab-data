54 BLADDER WOUNDS IN HERNIA OPERATIONS. it lies in contact with the pubic bones, triangular ligament and lower part of rectum, or cervix uteri and vagina (Deavers Sur- gical Anatomy). When distended the bladder may reach as high as the um- bilicus behind the recti muscles, and the area covered by peri- toneum is then mostly posterior and is bounded above by the urachus and below by the line connecting the orifices of the ureters and at the front of the sides by the obliterated hypo- gastric arteries. The anterior and lateral sides of the organ, which are not covered with peritoneum, are loosely united to Fig. 1.â€”Schematic illustration of the position and relation of the moderately distended bladder. the adjacent structures by areolar and fatty tissues containing numerous veins. This prevesical areolar tissue and fat is con- tinuous with the extra-peritoneal areolar tissue. Distention and movements of the bladder are favored by these loose connections and it is not surprising that the dis- tended organ, under the downward pressure of a strain, should follow the direction of least resistance, and prolapse as a direct hernia through the extra-peritoneal areolar tissue to the inguinal canal near the external abdominal ring. (Fig. 2.) In infancy and childhood these conditions are unlikely as

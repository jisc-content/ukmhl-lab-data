MANAGEMENT OF ULCERATED CONDITIONS. 158 always with the most satisfactory results. In fact, if I were deprived of the nutritive method in the treatment of X-ray burns, I could not promise a cure by any other method with which I am familiar. I spoke of epithelioma, the superficial variety in skin surfaces, and I mentioned a drug long known for its value in such lesions but frequently forgotten, viz: terchloride of antimony. The sur- face is dried, not scraped, cut or curetted, and the solution (10%), which was formerly officinal, applied. Over this a wet antiseptic dressing (2% carbolic) or a dry sterile dressing is applied. Fresh applications are made as often as a scab forms on the skin which can be lifted off without tearing the base of the ulcer, generally at intervals of three or four days. The cervix cases in early stages of ulceration (epithelial degeneration) have responded most satisfactorily to repeated applications of this drag; at least it can be tried before more radical and destructive measures are employed. To summarize: In simple ulcerated conditions which are slow to heal, or refuse to heal, we have in local nutrition an effective and expedient adjunct to their cure. In superficial epithelioma we have the terchloride of antimony, a valuable drug to control and to relieve and to heal the ulceration.

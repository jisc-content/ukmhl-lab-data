ABDOMINAL RELAXATION. 434 should be replaced and repaired, if there are lacerations or pro- lapse. The kidney should be fixed, if it has an intermittent blocking of the outlet. The liver should be sutured in place, if it is causing pain because of its low and moveable position. A dislocated spleen may require surgical operation to replace and fix it. Too great emphasis can not be given to the need of careful study of each case of abdominal relaxation to determine its cause, and then the exercise of judgment and perseverance in the application of the principles indicated in this brief outline.

314 ATRESIA OF THE VAGINA WITH HEMATOMETRA. open the blood-filled sacs, and, after wiping out their con- tents, seek to make proper provision for the escape of menstrual blood through a new vaginal canal. Theoretically, the last plan is the one to elect, as it implies the retention of the sexual organs and the continuation of their function. Experience, however, has taught this to be seldom practicable, in spite of the ex- cellent work of Zweiffel, Hofmeier, Tuffier and others. The removal of the tubes and ovaries, leaving the blood-filled uterus (and rudimentary vagina), I believe to be less desirable than the radical operation. Where, however, from technical diffi- culties it may not be possible to remove the uterus with the blood sacs, it will always be justifiable either to remove the adnexa alone or, in addition, to attach the uterine sac to the abdomen, or to the vagina when a patent and permanent canal can be properly made. In regard to the hematovarium, which constituted such an enormous tumor in my case, I have looked over the 164 cases which form the basis of this paper and find that it constituted part of the retention sac in 16 cases. In five cases it was situ- ated on the right side. In six cases it was situated on the left side. In four cases it was found on both sides. In one case its situation was not stated.

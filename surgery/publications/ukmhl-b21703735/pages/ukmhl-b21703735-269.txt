These are all cases of muscular imbalance, or, as our honored president, Roosa, would call it, latent strabismus, and may be cor- rected by drugs, as Seguin suggests, by wearing prisms or by an operation if needed. Change of scene and travel are useful but should not be ordered until we have fully corrected all the visual defects. Again, after all these things have been done, we may find it necessary to allow the patients to use the eyes only by degrees, by the method called Dyers Plan—which I have found useful in some cases—in which we allow them to use the eyes only for stated periods certain times a day. In closing this paper, we must all admit that eye-strain does exist in far greater numbers than in former years, that it is due to a civilization that demands much more constant use of the eyes, that many of our people must have certain abnormal development of the visual apparatus as regards the -refraction and the motility, and that the general physician should have, or be aware of, some means by which he may realize the possible presence of eye-strain and then be able to take such means for its correction as may seem best.

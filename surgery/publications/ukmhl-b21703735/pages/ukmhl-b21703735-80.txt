58 BLADDER WOUNDS IN HERNIA OPERATIONS. a sacculus of the bladder wall was ligated with the hernial sac and cut away. In others the viscus was injured by picking up and ligating what appeared to be a mass of loose fat deep in the canal. And in still another, the ureter, as well as a part of the bladder wall, was ligated and cut away. The acci- dents in these cases were only realized when urine leaked through the inguinal wound, or blood was present in the voided urine.

In two cases the autopsy showed that the patient had died from shock due to the extravasation of urine into the peritoneal cavity and loss of blood from an unseen wound. Management of Bladder Complication in Hernia.—The special operative procedure necessary is to remove the bladder protru- sion or diverticulum as far from the immediate vicinity of the canal as possible, otherwise, the hernia is quite liable to recur.

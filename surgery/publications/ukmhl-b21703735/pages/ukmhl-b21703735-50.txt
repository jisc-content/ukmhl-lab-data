32 SOME MEDICO-LEGAL ASPECTS OF INEBRIETY. companied by immoderate thirst for alcoholic beverages, is usually found in inheritors, imbeciles with small psy- chical powers of resistance, especially when assuming new burdens; cases of periodic mania of alcoholic habits, maniacal phase of maniac depressive or circular insanity, of which the depressive state is not very prominent; periodic melancholia or hypochondria, in which stimulation is resorted to to relieve the depression; also periodic nervous diseases, on the basis of hysteria with heightened appetite for alcohol and total aversion to nourishment, of epileptic nature and may seem periodically like an epileptic dream-state.

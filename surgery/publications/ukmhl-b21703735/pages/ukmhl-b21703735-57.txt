Further- more, it is estimated that 51% of all paupers in alms-houses came there through drink, and Warden Roberts, of the New York Almshouse, on Blackwell's Island, estimates that 90% of the 2593 inmates are there through drink. Of the 24,300 patients in Bellevue Hospital in 1900, Dr. Alexander Lambert (1904) found that over 25% went through the alcoholic ward. It is furthermore estimated that 10% of all mortality and 20% of all disease is due to alcoholism. In conclusion, it would seem that as- we have experts for all other diseases, alienists for mental disease and neurologists for nervous disease for example, so should we have expert " in- ebrietists," or specialists on the subject of inebriety to cope suc- cessfully with this broad and far-reaching problem.

SUPPURATIVE LESIONS OF THE PHARYNX. 389 The free openings thus made have little or no tendency to close before the abscess cavity is clean, and when successfully made insure rapid subsidence of the disease. When thorough drain- age has been established, cure may be hastened by a gargle of peroxide of hydrogen diluted with boiled water—one part to four. This gargling should be repeated at intervals of an hour or even half-hour. An iron mixture may be prescribed with ad- vantage in most cases. Of these, none is better than a suitable dose of the tincture, dispensed with glycerine, and directed to be taken in half a glass of effervescent soda water. In all cases recurrence is best guarded against by careful, intelligent attention to the throat. There need be no hyper- trophic tonsils; often there is little of any sort of tonsil showing, but search in this region nearly always reveals unhealthy tissue. Quite often this will be found as an infected mass buried within 9 Fig. 2. Angular forceps for opening peritonsillar abscess. the mucous membrane—the so-called submerged tonsil—or in- fected lymphoid tissue may lie behind an apparently clean tonsil Search of the recess above the tonsil, called the supra-tonsillar fossa, will often lead to the detection of such a condition. After a throat has withstood one or more attacks of quinsy, the tissues about the tonsils apparently remain more or less saturated with organisms, and even the most skilful removal of the tonsil may fail fully to eradicate the tendency to recurrent suppuration. It is somewhat analagous to the condition of the skin of the neck in certain individuals who suffer from repeated outbreaks of " boils." Change of climate, diet, bathing, and a course of alteratives are necessary for some of these patients. In infants and young children, abscess formation in the pharynx is not rare, but in them it assumes a special form, and is not in close relation to the tonsil. In these subjects the retro-

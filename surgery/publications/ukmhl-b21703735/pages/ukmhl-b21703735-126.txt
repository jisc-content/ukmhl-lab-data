PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. 104 harsh. There was an area two inches by two inches of marked tenderness just to the right of the free border of the ribs. The liver dulness extended over the following area: In the posterior axillary line six inches, mid-axillary line six inches, anterior axillary line five inches, parasternal line four inches. The superficial area of splenic dulness was five inches in length and four and a half inches in breadth. There was no edema of the extremities and the reflexes were normal. The muscles were flabby but not atrophied. Pupils were equal and reacted to light and accommodation. During the first week the temperature ranged between 104° and 101° F. During the second week it fluctuated between 101° and normal, and through the remainder of his stay in the hospital it was about normal.

Any attempt to remove the cotton would cause the bleeding to begin anew. The hemorrhage was partially controlled by sprays of adrenalin alternating with antipyrin solution. At this time the patient complained of pain in his right ear and an examination showed petechial hemorrhages in the tympanic membrane about the short process of the malleolus. Blood examination on admission, November 8, 1904: Hemoglobin 55% Erythrocytes 1,068,000 Leucocytes 4,500 Marked poikilocytosis with a number of megaloblasts and normoblasts and a few karyokinetic figures. The proportion of megaloblasts to normoblasts was about three to one. Differential leucocyte count: Polynuclears 60% Small lymphocytes 26% Large mononuclears 12% Transitional forms 2% The Plasmodium malarise was not present and the Widal reac- tion was negative. Urine was of dark color and apparently contained a large amount of coloring matter, such as urobilin. The diazo-reaction

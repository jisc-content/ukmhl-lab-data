MASTOIDEOTYMPANOTOMY. 231 tered the bone by first removing the tip of, the process. The cellular structure was softened and filled with bleeding granu- lations. The softened bone extended well over the base internal to the digastric fossa. The inner table was softened and it was necessary to uncover the sigmoid sinus throughout its whole length. An epidural abscess covered the vertical limb of the sinus. The sinus appeared unaffected. The'dura mater cover- ing the sinus and extending some distance behind it was thick- ened and red, thus showing pachymeningitis. I uncovered a very large area of the dura. The intracranial tension appeared to me normal. Large cells were opened far back in the occipital bone. Some pus was found under pressure in the cells lying TIckj! ; | ; 3 i 3 ttv 102' 101' 100' 99/ m: 97' 9Cl • ••» •»' •••• .... ; ....j . j—j—j ;"" j i j"". ™; " " j""; "j ~ J* J*"-.

The posterior meatal wall was removed nearly to the attachment of the drum membrane and the epitympanum was exposed. I closed the wound around two small cigarette drains, one extending into the antrum and one to the jugular bulb, packed the meatus lightly and applied a wet dressing. The operation lasted one hour and fifteen minutes; much delay being caused by the constant bleed- ing. Owing to the patient's mental condition, convalescence was very slow. She tried to take her own life by jumping out of the window. She deranged the dressings several times and pulled them off twice. Hair became matted in the wound which was partly open, resulting in the infection of the wound. No packing

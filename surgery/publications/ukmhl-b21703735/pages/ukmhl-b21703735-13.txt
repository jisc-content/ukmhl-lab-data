Advancing the standard of academic requirements for all persons entering upon a career of medicine. 5. Safeguarding the interests of the New York State Medical prac- titioners as against practitioners resident in other States, desirous of being admitted to practice in New York State. Dr. Roosa ceased his official connection with the State Society many years ago, but his interest in the welfare of the medical profession never lagged.

It was the song which Benjamin Franklin says he sang a dozen times a

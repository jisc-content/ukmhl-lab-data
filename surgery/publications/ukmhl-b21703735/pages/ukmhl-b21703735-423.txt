With the direct-view instrument we can, as a rule, see the two-thirds of the bladder further from the outlet better, while with the prismatic type instrument" we can usually see better the two-thirds of the bladder nearest the bladder neck. This rule, of course, is an arbitrary one, and we find many varia- tions in it. We should, however, be able to use both types of instrument with equal facility. In spite, however, of our honest efforts to do this, each individual physician will have leanings towards one or the other cystoscopes for most of his work. For many years after Brenner brought out his direct view instru- ment in Germany, the method was generally condemned and finally abandoned. The main reasons for this were owing to the right-angle position of this instrument's beak which caused much pain to the patient on its introduction, and because of the one catheter it carried being brought out above the field of vision. This made it well nigh impossible to catheterize a ureter* and it was changed later on. With Tilden Brown's type of cystoscope, which has a correct curve to the beak, the instrument is easily introduced and catheterization made comparatively easy. With other models following the original Brenner instru- ment, the method has become very generally the one of choice in this country, and some European surgeons now employ it with satisfaction in their work.

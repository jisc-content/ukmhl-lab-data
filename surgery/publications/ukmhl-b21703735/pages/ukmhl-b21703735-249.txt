CARCINOMA OF THE HEART. 193 Paulich, Birsch-Hirschfeld and others.3 Tumors may involve the heart by continuity from tumors of the esophagus, medi- astinum, stomach or lung. The secondary deposits may involve the endocardium, the myocardium or the pericardium. Frequency of Cardiac Carcinoma.—That carcinoma of the heart is rare is shown by Bodenheimer4 in his comprehensive dis- sertation. He states that Forster. Eppinger and Eiselt.com- puted that 7.5% of cases of carcinomata with general dis- seminated metastases involve the heart. Pic and Bret5 state that the ratio of secondary carcinoma found at autopsy is about 3 in 1000. The following table, arranged by the writer from figures given by various authors, illustrates the frequency of carcinoma in- volving the heart: Number of Number of Authority. Autopsies.

Johns Hopkins Hospital10 2942 10 One primary tumor. The occurrence of primary carcinoma in the heart is disputed. Bodenheimer claims that this may be the case, but Libert denies their existence. Symptoms.—The physical signs of cardiac neoplasm vary. They depend upon the size and position of the tumor. Large endocardial tumors may cause cardiac insufficiency, by preventing closure of the valves, or they may obstruct the flow of blood by their size. If extensive in the myocardium, they may produce the symptoms of broken compensation. Boden- heimer states that the symptoms are usually produced mechani- cally. There may be precordial pain, a sense of oppression, anxiety, dyspnea, dizziness, edema of the extremities, effusion into the serous cavities, syncope, etc. Ribbert states that the heart may be involved so extensively with metastases that only a small portion of the muscle is left.

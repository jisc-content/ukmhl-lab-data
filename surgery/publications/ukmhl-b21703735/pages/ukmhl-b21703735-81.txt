BLADDER WOUNDS IN HERNIA OPERATIONS. 59 Personally, I have resorted to two methods. In the first, the bladder hernia is freed from the surrounding tissues by blunt dissection and carried well towards the median line, and held there by suturing the prevesical fatty fascia to the con- joined tendon. Adhesions forming, the viscus is held quite satisfactorily. By passing the blunt end of the needle care- fully through the prevesical fascia, there is little danger of puncturing the wall of the bladder. My preference is strongly for the second method, which I call the method of " inversion." A purse-string suture of Fig. 5.â€”Diverticulum inverted into the bladder. catgut is run around the neck or the border of the protruding diverticulum, or sacculus, which is then completely inverted, without opening, back into the bladder, just as the cut appendix is invaginated into the caecum, and the purse-string suture securely drawn tight and tied. (Figs. 4, 5, 6.) The same pre- caution is taken in placing the purse-string suture in the mus- cular coat of the bladder wall, as is followed in running that suture in the caecum in the operation of appendectomy. The illustrations convey an idea of the method more clearly than words. The first method should be confined to those cases in

EXCESSIVE GASTRIC SECRETION. 443 alcohol on Pawlow-dogs, which I carried out in the Patho- logical Institute of Berlin, I frequently could obtain, after the same food, or after the same sham-feeding, three and four times the amount of gastric juice if alcohol was added or brought into the stomach for a short time before the psychic or local secre- tory stimuli were applied; but I was unable to modify to any extent the acidity of the juice. These facts concern the stomach of the dog. The next question is whether these facts correspond with the condition of the human stomach.

Hornborg, Roeder and Sommerfeld, and especially Bickel4 have shown that the acidity of the pure gastric juice of the human stomach varies between 0,4—0,55%, (= 100-150cc. of 1/10 normal HQ solution); further, that the psychic and reflex stimuli, duration, etc. are in principle the 4.

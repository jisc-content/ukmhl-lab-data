118 THE NEED OF POST-GRADUATE INSTRUCTION IN PEDIATRICS. BY AUGUSTUS CAILLE, M.D. Professor of Medicine (Diseases of Children), New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. In the making of a medical practitioner there is still a lack of system and uniformity, which is difficult to explain except as we view it as one of the forms of inherited or transmitted human inertia noticeable along sanitary lines in general. At the present time the best results are probably obtained where a student, endowed with good " preliminaries," enters a medical school which is part and parcel of a large university so located as to be able to offer to the senior student in med- icine ample hospital facilities and abundant clinical material; with its curriculum so arranged that the undergraduates' time is not taken up by didactic lectures, and the student is early brought into contact with the evidence of nature's manifesta- tions in health and disease by means of practical courses in chemical, physiological and pathological laboratories. Small medical colleges can, no doubt, also turn out good practitioners on account of the greater care given to each student, but to accomplish this they must offer a system of " object lesson teaching " by means of which, as Agassiz tersely says, " One may study nature, not books." Faulty as it is, we must confess that the wholesome impetus of a good medical school makes the student eager for the two years' hospital and bedside training which is to follow, and at the end of which he is fairly well equipped to be let loose upon the public as a general practitioner. In the realm of pediatrics, however, the young physician as he starts, out upon his life of service, is deplorably ignorant. He may be able successfully to cope with difficulties in diag- nosis and to formulate indications for treatment and even carry out proper treatment in the adult, but when he is con- fronted with the problems presenting themselves as regards the hygienic, dietetic and specific management of the ailing child, he stands, as far as practical knowledge goes, " vis a vis de r-ien," and is unable to stake and prove his claim in pediatrics

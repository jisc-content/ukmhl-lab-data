402 AMAUROTIC FAMILY IDIOCY. Report of a Case with Remarks, by a. e. davis, m.d. Professor of Diseases of the Eye, New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. Histologic Report of the Eye. by edward l. oatman, m.d. Surgeon Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital. This peculiar disease, amaurotic family idiocy, is of special interest to oculists, because of the striking and characteristic changes which take place within the eyes during the progress of the affection, and which are pathognomatic of it. In fact, it was the observations of these changes in the eyes —consisting of a grayish-white haze surrounding the macula?, which were cherry-red in color—that led to the discovery of the disease by Warren Tay, in 1881, who published the report of his case in the first volume of the " Transactions of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom," under the title of " Symmetrical Changes in the Region of the Yellow Spot in Each Eye of an Infant." Tay was of the opinion that the condition was a local affection limited to the eye. To Sachs, of New York, belongs the credit of having first called attention to the general character of the disease. He published a report of a case in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases in 1887. H. Knapp examined the fundus of the eyes in this case, and his report is cited by Sachs. To Sachs also we are indebted for the name "amaurotic family idiocy," based on clinical symptoms and not on anatomical grounds, as had been done previously, each observer describing the disease under some special name until this time, 1896. • As the disease is a comparatively rare one, and not frequently seen except by specialists—something over a hundred cases having been reported up to date—I venture to cite in brief the chief symptoms of the affection, as given by Sachs himself in 1896: 1. Mental impairment, observed during the first few months of life, leading to absolute idiocy.

TRUE PRIMARY OVARIAN PREGNANCY. 246 In fact, the more conservative men were guarded in their ex- pression when reporting such observations. Thus, Mauriceau claims but to recognize in his case a " hernia uteri," and Bartholin* states that Riolan did not believe in the cases he (himself) had published in book form, but had pretended to believe in them merely out of respect for the Court Physician, Pierre Seguin, who had observed them. About that time the study of the ovary received a strong impetus. The Graafian follicles were discovered and studied, and although at first misinterpreted to be " ovula," the labors of Harvey (1651), Nil Stenson (1667), Van Home (1668), Kerckring (1671), Swammerdam (1672) and especially Regnier de Graaf, dispelled many doubts which had arisen in this connection. From this time on, the numerous cases of rupture of the uterus disappear from the literature and reports of extrauterine pregnancy take their place. In his inaugural thesis Gurgui gave a beautiful exposition of the subject of ovarian pregnancy, and divided the cases into two parts: in the first part those reported up to 1845, and in the second those reported from 1845 to 1880. In the classification adopted in the present paper, Gurgui will be followed closely, many parts being a literal translation from his work; but, in addition, all the probable cases reported in the literature from 1880 to 1908, which have been accessible to the writer, will re- ceive attention. All the cases of ovarian pregnancy reported before 1845. These are obviously dermoid cysts of the ovary mistaken for cases of ovarian pregnancy.

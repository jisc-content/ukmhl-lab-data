162 PRIMARY EPITHELIOMA OF THE VAGINA. cases of carcinoma of the female genitalia. Schottlander, at Heidelberg, has found four cases in 150 cases of uterine cancer. This is above the usual average. Franz, at Jena, has seen two cases in 125 cases of carcinoma of the portio since October, 1904. Zweifel, at Leipsic, has seen four cases out of 1400 cases of carcinoma, up to 1906. Friedl states that, up to 1896, the journals contain records of 130 cases, and Cumston, of Boston, says there are only 150 cases up to 1900. W. Roger Williams, in a study of this disease, states that of 9226 tumors in women, 54 were in the vagina. Of these 40 were carcinoma, two sarcoma, three myoma, and nine cystoma. Therefore, he believes that cancer is by far the most common form of primary vaginal neoplasm, in spite of its rarity. He has seen five cases. His data, from London hospitals, show only 0.43 per cent of all cancers in women to be of vaginal origin. Reiche, in Hamburg, tabulated 7498 deaths from cancer, and of these only 29 were vaginal, or 0.38 per cent. Hecht in 4507 cases found 50 vaginal, or 1.1 per cent. Gurlt in Vienna gives 1.6 per cent. Walshe in 3076 cases found 14 were vaginal. Martin gives the proportion at 1 per cent. Bergel found 14 cases in 8287 deaths by cancer. Schwarz at Berlin found 0.24 per cent, and Pozzi 0.42 per cent. Bernard states that there were two cases out of 475 women in Pozzi's service. Schmideleschner says recently, that in many thousands of cases of cancer observed in his clinic during the past 23 years, he has seen but seven cases of primary vaginal epithelioma. Eppinger, in the pathological Institute of Prague, has en- countered 79 cases of cancer of the uterus and three of primary origin in the vagina. Williams has averaged many of these ob- servations, and he gives the percentage of vaginal origin as less than 1 per cent. This rarity is certainly astonishing when we remember that the uterus, a connecting organ, is most prone to the disease of all the organs in women. Zizold states that this is due to the anatomical construction of the vagina, it being deficient in glands. Age.â€”Epithelioma of the vagina is essentially a disease of adult and post-meridian life, but in numerous instances it oc- curs at an earlier age than cancer in general. Williams has combined 17 cases which he has studied to Bernard's 59, making a total of 76 cases, and has found the age distribution was as follows:

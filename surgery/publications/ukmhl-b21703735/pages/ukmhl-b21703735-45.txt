SOME MEDICO-LEGAL ASPECTS OF INEBRIETY. 27 BY G.

Even now, at the present session of the New York State Legislature, a bill has been introduced to create a commission to study the treatment of inebriates and persons addicted to the excessive use of narcotics and their relation to the commission of crime and, furthermore, as to the expediency of establishing a State Institution for the care of sixch persons.

The New York State Lunacy Commission from 1888 to 1902, in their admissions to the various state hospitals for the insane, found

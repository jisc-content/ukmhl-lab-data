ATRESIA OF THE VAGINA WITH HEMATOMETRA. 313 Up to 1898 v. Rosenthal was able to collect 18 celiotomies, done in cases of bicornate uterus, Avith 18 recoveries. My own studies, covering the past 20 years, show the fol- lowing results concerning amputation of a blood-filled horn in the double uterus: Successfully operated by vaginal celiotomy [94l 1 case Successfully operated by vaginal celiotomy [with hemato- salpinx 114] 1 case Successfully operated by laparotomy [85, 92, 104,. 109, 112, 125, 127^ 128, 129, 131, 132, 134, 141]. 13 cases Successfully operated by laparotomy (with hematosalpinx) [86, 91, 95, 96, 100, 110, 121, 136] 8 cases Total 23 cases Died after laparotomy (with hematosalpinx) [116, 137] 2 cases There were, therefore, 23 successful operations and two deaths. Hysterectomy {supra-vaginal or total) for unilateral hemato- metra was done 15 times without a single death: Per vaginam [132] 1 case Abdominal section [106, 113, 123, 126, 138, 142, 144] 7 cases Abdominal section (with hematosalpinx) [102, 115, 118, 119, 135, 139, 143] 7 cases Total 15 cases Including my own case, we find, therefore, in the past 20 years, 23 cornual amputations and 28 hysterectomies done on the double uterusâ€”a total of 51 operations with five deaths. Of 16 cases complicated with hematosalpinx, there were two deaths. How this compares with the figures of Fuld or of E. Simon, who 20 years ago, in 18 cases treated by the older meth- ods, found 12 deaths, will readily be appreciated. Nothing could more positively prove the correctness of Fuld's position at that time when he positively stated that laparotomy must be the treatment of the future. While Fuld limited himself to advising the removal of the blood-sac in hematosalpinx and thus, at one stride, wiped out the fearful mortality which prevailed down to his time, the question arises to-day whether we are to limit ourselves to a salpingotomy (or exsection of the blood-filled horn in the double uterus); whether we should go further and do a hysterec- tomy, or whether we should content ourselves with splitting

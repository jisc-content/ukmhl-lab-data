All such are practically negative, and have been so considered. ■ The earliest sign of reaction oc- curred in one case within two hours after the instillation. The latest developed 24 hours after the instillation. The test was tried a second time in this case, when the reaction was delayed 20 hours. In one case all signs of reaction had disappeared within 24 hours; in another case a mild conjunctivitis remained for three weeks. There appears to be no relation between the intensity of the reaction and th'e extent of involvement or acuteness of the dis- ease. For example, one case of acute Pott's disease on two different occasions reacted but mildly, whereas other cases without any acute symptoms gave a very severe reaction. In all instances in which a negative or doubtful reaction fol- lowed the first instillation, and a positive reaction resulted from the second instillation, the patient had cried the first time, which probably accounted for the absence of reaction. When a second instillation is deemed necessary, it should not be given in the same eye. In case 18, of double hip disease, in which the reaction was twice negative, the patient was in a

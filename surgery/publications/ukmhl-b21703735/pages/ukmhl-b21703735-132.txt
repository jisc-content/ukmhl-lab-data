108 PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. and of late of general weakness and had spit up a little blood the day before she called, which she said came from her mouth and throat. When I examined her mouth I found most of her teeth bad and the gums extensively ulcerated, and I urged her to go at once to a dentist and return for further examination and treatment as soon as he was through with her. The patient failed to return; but in January, 1907, I was sent for and found her lying in bed in a miserable and badly ventilated basement dwelling, very ill indeed, bleeding profusely and very per- sistently from swollen and ulcerated gums. Unfortunately she had not followed previous advice but drifted along until she had to go to bed in an exhausted condition. A hurried examination of her blood showed great diminution of the erythrocytes, poikilocytosis and numerous lymphocytes. In spite of strenuous efforts made by myself and assistant and nurse we did not succeed in controlling the bleeding or in overcoming the general asthenia in which we found her, and she died from sepsis and exhaustion at the end of two weeks. The proportion of cases of pernicious anemia caused by cyto- lytic ferments originating through diseases of the oral cavity or the gastrointestinal tract may not be as large as some of us think or believe, but that quite a few cases have that origin is certain from the description of the above cases and the observations of many other authors. And that such cases can be greatly benefited and even cured by treatment as above described and carried out assiduously and persistently does not admit of any further doubt.

BLADDER WOUNDS IN HERNIA OPERATIONS. 57 comes out immediately above the pubic bone into the inguinal canal, on the inner side, or behind, the cord, may well be bladder. If this same tumor is covered with fat of a light lemon color (prevesical fat), from which it separates with difficulty and does not " shell out," the diagnosis should be positive. Again, a bladder diverticulum is often attached to the surrounding tis- sues by adhesions. It is useless and misleading to watch for normal bladder wall with muscular fibres, as it becomes so thinned and changed in character as to be unrecognizable. A sound passed into the bladder through the urethra at this junction and felt at the tumor wall, would of course be con- clusive evidence. The one procedure that has proven of the greatest service Fig. 3.â€”Common form of protrusion where both peritoneum and bladder wall are protruding. Section shows dividing line. Incision above this line enters the peritoneal cavity; below, it opens into the bladder. to me is to open into the abdominal cavity high up in the canal and examine the tumor from the inside. In some cases two sacs may present on the inner side of the inguinal canal. (Fig. 3.) By opening the upper one near its neck and passing the finger into the abdominal cavity, the lower sac may be identified and treated accordingly. In instances where the bladder is opened or wounded at operation, the appearance of the mucosa of bladder, when recognizable, or the presence of urine, are further evidence to the above in establishing its identity. However, notwithstanding all these points of diagnosis, the literature shows many cases in which the bladder hernia was not recognized even on opening into it. In one case,

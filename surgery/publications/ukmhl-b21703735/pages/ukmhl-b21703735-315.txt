TRUE PRIMARY OVARIAN PREGNANCY. 247 Division 2.—In which teeth, bone and sometimes hair were found within the ovary. Lamzweerde 1671 Blasius 1675 Tyson, 3 cases 1679 Stalpart 1682 Needham 1683 Sampson, Birch 1683 Mulebancher 1687 Teroude 1690 Marci 1690 Mery 1695 Nichols 1696 Ruysch, 3 cases 1716 Grambs 1729 Le Riche 1741 Bolten 1746 Jaegerschmid 1765 Gooch 1772 Greding 1773 Baudelocque 1777 Laflize 1777 Murray 1780 Cleghorn 1784 Schuetzenkranz 1785 Young 1787 De Mederer, 2 cases 1787 Baillie .' 1789 Dumas 1792 Baillie 1794 Bicker 1794 Plouquet 1798 Brown, 2 cases 1798 Nysten 1803 Merriman 1812 Phillips 1817 Lobstein 1820 Hesselbach . .1820 Cruveilhier, 6 cases. . . . 1829-1835 This makes a total of 48 cases in Division 2. If to this number the cases reported by Corvinus, Cocchi, Meckel, Alquie and others are added, and also cases where only shreds were found, as by Cochon, Dupuis, Littre, and Boehmer, and in addition to these corpora lutea misinterpreted as pregnancy, and the case of Everard Home, a grand total of about 60 cases might be counted in this division, or nearly 80 cases in Group I. In perusing the literature of ovarian tumors which contain teeth, bone or hair, the latter being at the time looked upon as; products of conception, one is amused by the glib and ever ready explanation offered by those who were presumed to know. Thus, in the case of a married woman, it was due to witchcraft etc., but if found in a single woman or widow the case was one of abortive gestation, normal development having been arrested by fear, grief, or shame—consequent upon illicit intercourse. This might be termed the serio-comic side of the situation. Many a woman's reputation was blasted and her good name sacrificed on the altar of ignorance. This is not only sad to con- template—it is tragic (see Astruc, Dezeimeris, Cauwenberghe,. De Smet in Literature appended).

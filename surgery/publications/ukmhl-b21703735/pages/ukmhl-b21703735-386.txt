30S ATRESIA OF THE VAGINA WITH HEMATOMETRA. cases making a good recovery. In 1898, v. Rosenthal was able to add seven more successful laparotomies in cases of this kind. Saenger, in 1896, collected 11 cases (according to v. Rosenthal) of hematosalpinx complicating this condition for which adnexal ablation was successfully done. v. Rosenthal adds six more, in several of which the offending horn was simultaneously re- moved. My own series (collected since 1889) of laparotomies (excluding hysterectomies) for hematosalpinx in the single genital canal with primary atresia of the hymen or vagina, is as follows: Successful operations: Incision of hematosalpinx evacuation of bloody contents, with immediate suture [68] 1 case Salpingo-oophorectomy and salpingostomy [71] 1 case Salpingotomy or salpingo-oophorectomy [1, 7, 20, 27, 37, 39, 47, 52, 53, 55, 56, 73] 12 cases Incision of hematometra, evacuation of bloody contents. Salpingotomy or salpingo-oophorectomy [67] 1 case Total 15 cases Unsuccessful (fatal) operations: Salpingotomy or salpingo-oophorectomy [19, 23, 38, 40], total 4 cases So that, in this classification, we find four deaths in 19 cases operated on during the past 20 years. The four fatal interventions for hematosalpinx in the single genital canal with primary atresia are herewith briefly given: C. C. Webster (1895), young girl, from Iceland, who had never menstruated, with history of retention covering three years. Atresia vaginas of the lower one-quarter. Hemato (pyo) colpos; hemato (pyo) trachelos; hematometra (?); left hematosalpinx. Laparotomy, Peritonitis present. Distended left blood-filled tube opened and emptied. Double salpingo-oophorectomy. Death a few weeks later from septic peritonitis. The pelvis and. thorax were secured and frozen. Vertical mesial sections were made, from one of which a beautiful illustration is printed. The uterus was enlarged to 4|- inches. Its walls were very much thickened and its cavity was empty. The cervix and upper occluded vagina were distended with " thick, greenish fluid and fibrinous septa." C. Martin (1896). Atresia vaginae (in upper f) and cervix.

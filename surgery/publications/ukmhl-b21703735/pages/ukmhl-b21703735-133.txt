109 BIOLOGY AS THE BASIC PRINCIPLE IN INFANT FEEDING. BY HENRY DWIGHT CHAPIN, M.D. Professor of Medicine (Diseases of Children) New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. Anyone looking over the teachings of American and European pediatricians concerning the artificial nutrition of infants, can hardly fail to conclude that this subject is far from being estab- lished on a scientific basis, because of the conflicting theories in regard to the proper methods of selecting and preparing the food. Upon looking below the surface, it will be found that not a little of the conflict of opinion concerns details merely, and is due to differing conditions in the various countries; what is considered as being absolutely essential in one place seems to be of little consequence in another, so that the stress laid upon the particular procedure appears incomprehensible; and also to the fact that no basic principles appear to have been recog- nized by all. It seems almost unnecessary to state that infants are essen- tially the same in all parts of the world, especially in the tem- perate zones, where the great mass of population is found, and therefore must have the basic nutritional factors in common. Their differences, then, must be due to individual idiosyncrasies and difference in environment. It is manifestly impossible to establish any narrow princi- ples adapted to every nutritional peculiarity of every infant under every kind of environment; and it might as well be accepted, first as last, that there are no fixed quantities or forms of food that are invariably needed by each infant under any or all conditions. We must look further for basic prin- ciples, the more so because it is well known that no two indi- viduals are exactly alike, and Nature has endowed every living thing with more or less power or ability to change its methods of living and nutrition as its environment and food-supply change. The infant possesses the power of adapting itself to many apparently unnatural methods of nutrition and forms of food, and it is this fact that accounts for the many different infants'

129 CONSTANT PATENCY OF THE PYLORUS. and stenosis of the pylorus (stenosis et insufficientia pylori). In my paper, " A Further Contribution to Our Knowledge of Ischochymia,"* I said: " The constant or frequent occurrence of small quantities of. bile in the stomach does not in my experience militate against the existence of a narrowing of the pylorus; on the other hand, it appears to me to point to a firm rigidity of this orifice, in consequence of which the latter is never com- pletely closed. A thickened and rigid pylorus of this kind was found in the patient described above, Aaron L. and in Mrs. S., and in both cases a certain amount of bile was constantly in the stomach." Th's affection I have observed in benign as well as malignant diseases of the pylorus. In as far as very little is found in litera- ture on this topic, I thought it expedient to publish this case in detail. It resembles those published in 1S97, and can well serve as a good example of stenosis and insufficiency of the pylorus. * Medical Record, June 19, 1897.

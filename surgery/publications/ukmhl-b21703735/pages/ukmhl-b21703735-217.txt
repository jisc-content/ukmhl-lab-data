PRIMARY EPITHELIOMA OF THE VAGINA. 163 20 to 30 years 12 cases. 30 to 40 " 14 " 40 to 50 " 12 " 50 to 60 " 22 " 60 to 70 " 14 " 70 to 80 " 2 " In Williams' 17 cases, the average age of onset was 40 years. (In uterine cancer it is 44 years and in mammary 48 years.) The earliest age of onset that he has found was 17 years. The classical cases, frequently reported in the literature, of Guersant, 3^ years, Johannovsky 9 years, and Smith 14 months, must almost surely have been sarcomatous. Sarcoma of the vagina is much more frequent in children than in adults. Starfinger studied 26 cases of sarcoma of the vagina and found 24 were under five years of age. The majority of the cases, according to the above table, arise between 50 and 60 years, or after the menopause. Trapenard, in a more recent study (1907), found somewhat different results. He has tabulated 40 cases and found the ages as follows: 20 to 30 years 2 cases. 30 to 40 " 15 " 40 to 50 " „ 10 " 50 to 60 " 7 " 60 to 70 " 4 " 70 to 80 " 2 " He therefore found the predominance between 30 and 50 years. Kiistner has collected 24 cases, and the majority were between 30 and 40 years of age; two were between 15 and 20, and two between 20 and 30. Gebhard has reported a case in a girl 14 years old. Pregnancy.—Pregnancy seems to have no bearing upon the etiology. Nuliparas are as prone to the disease as multiparas. In one-fourth of Bernard's cases there had never been a pregnancy. Kiistner found it in six virgins. Heredity.—Heredity seems to have little bearing upon the etiology. Kustner found hereditary cancer once in 22 cases. Pozzi reports one case where both parents died of cancer.

CONGENITAL STENOSIS OF PULMONARY ARTERY. 485 There was no lesion to be found in any organ. The pulse was carefully studied in all the cases, with no par- ticular result. The pulse in pulmonary stenosis may be small or not, slow or rapid. It is influenced more by the health of the pa- tient and bodily exertion or rest at the time of the examination, than by the lesion itself. Having mentioned above the deciding signs which prompted the diagnosis of congenital pulmonary stenosis in our cases, it would be useless to repeat them. The pulmonary area is, indeed, "a region of romance," or a ground for guessing; but the physical signs of stenosis of the pulmonary artery, particularly of congenital origin, are so pro- nounced and so unlike any other resulting from a lesion of the heart or lungs, that no mistake should be made. The only question that could arise is whether the lesion is pulmonary stenosis only or complicated by one or more forms of malforma- tion. This question could be settled by ascertaining theÂ«point of maximum intensity of the murmur and presence of the systolic thrill. In stenosis, the two should be located over the pulmonary area. Even if suspicion be entertained of the presence of other congenital lesions of the "heart besides the one under dis- cussion, the observer is justified in disregarding them, and in view of the physical determining signs, he can say that the clinical diagnosis is pulmonary stenosis.

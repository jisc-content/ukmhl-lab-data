PERITONITIS. 143 In some instances of chronic pelveo-peritonitis the diagnosis must depend upon the palpatory sensitiveness of the plevic peritoneum. When the inflammatory process is circumscribed and limited to small areas, as in the case of neurasthenic patients, it is sometimes quite difficult to determine whether the pain caused on palpation is due to the patient's neurotic condition, or to a low grade of inflammation. This can generally be de- termined by palpating different parts of the pelvic peritoneum, and ascertaining whether pain is complained of alike in all parts, or is localized at or about the same points. After an acute attack of pelvic peritonitis has passed off, it will sometimes be found that various dislocations of the pelvic organs have taken place. Although it has not been possible, in so brief an article, to go into the details of all phases of peritonitis from the stand-point of a gynecologist, yet the more important points have been con- sidered.

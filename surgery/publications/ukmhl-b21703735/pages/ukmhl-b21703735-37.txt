HEPATO-INTESTINAL-TOXEMIA. 19 or two drams to the quart. The water should be fairly hot; otherwise, giving such lavages may cause severe abdominal cramps, and in these cases all unnecessary pain and excitement is to be avoided. A word or two may be said about the anemia. After the first week or ten days, when, in other words, the liver and in- testinal tract have begun to be flushed out, we may begin to give the blander preparations of iron. Of these the following are especially to be commended. Pyrophosphate of iron, in one grain doses in capsules or solution; peptomanganate of iron (Gude), or hemaboloids plain or arseniated. The iron tonic should not be given until the toxemia is at least partly under control. Later, when an iron-tonic treatment is necessary, the following combination will be found especially beneficial: Acidi arsenosi, gr. 1/30 Strych. phosphatis, gr. 1/40 Ferri pyrophosphatis, gr. j M. et div. in caps. No. I. Sig: Take one capsule three times a day after meals. or Strych. glycerophosphatis, gr. 1/40 Ferri glycerophosphatis, gr. j Mangan. glycerophosphatis, gr. ij M. et div. in caps. No. I. Sig: Take one capsule three times a day after meals. For the nervous manifestations in these cases, especially at the onset, there is nothing better than the combinations of bromides. Five grains each of ammonium, potassium and sodium bromide, given in a little vichy or plain water two or three times daily, acts better in these cases of toxemia than any other sedative the writer knows. In cases complicated by neurasthenia, the preparations of valerian, especially valerianate of zinc, in 1 to 2 grain doses three times daily, seem to act well. Strychnin and its various combinations may be given with advantage where the patients are in need of such a neuromuscular stimulant and tonic, but if these patients are very nervous or the toxemia severe, strychnin should not be given at the start. The same may be said of arsenic and its various preparations.

COMPLICATED MASTOIDITIS. 7 that were present, as cultures made from the fluid evacuated through the dural opening, as well as those made from the fluid obtained by lumbar puncture, showed a true growth of the diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis. This brings up the question of early operation in cases of purulent meningitis. It would seem rational to operate early, drain these infected areas, and treat them on general surgical principles rather than to stand idly by and see the vast ma- jority terminate fatally. I believe that in the future this should be done, for even though but one case in several recovers, this in itself is a distinct gain, for now they are nearly all fatal. With improved surgical technique, may we not hope for more favorable results in the treatment of this condition? 62 West 52d Street.

106 PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. normoblasts. Last summer he obtained a position in the country where he spent most of his time out of doors. He im- proved to such an extent that he gained 40 pounds in weight and he was able to resume his duties on the police force last fall. He feels perfectly well now, and a blood count taken a few weeks ago, just one year since he entered the hospital, showed the fol- lowing results: Hemoglobin 85% Erythrocytes 4,320,000 Leucocytes 5,200 The red cells were perfectly normal in size and in shape, and repeated examinations failed to show any normoblasts or megaloblasts. Differential leucocyte count: Polynuclears 72% Small lymphocytes 21% Large mononuclears 5% Eosinophiles 2% As to the completeness of the recovery, I think the blood count, the patient's feelings, and his appearance will dispel all doubts.

The clinical picture of the case with its insidious onset, the extreme pallor of the patient without any emaciation, and the great exhaustion were very suggestive of the disease before the blood count had been taken. The blood examination with the marked oligocythemia, the relatively high color index, the extreme poikilocytosis, the large number of megaloblasts and normoblasts and the lymphocytosis is pathognomonic of per- nicious anemia.

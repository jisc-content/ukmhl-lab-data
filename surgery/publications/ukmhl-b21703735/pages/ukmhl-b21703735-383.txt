ATRESIA OF THE VAGINA WITH HEMATOMETRA. 305 atresia, hematosalpinx occurred 30 times. Fuld describes seven successful operations in the single genital canal, in which hematosalpinx was thought to be present. Neugebauer insists that Amussat's case be added. One operator, Rope, passed a catheter through the uterine cavity into the distended Fallopian tube and squeezed out the bloody contents—a method which Fuld properly condemns. Breisky released the blood success- fully in two cases, complicated by hematosalpinx, through a broad vaginal incision past the obliterated area. Without hematosalpinx Robert Meyer (1896) collected 18 cases of broad vaginal atresia operated on with 17 recoveries; with hemato- salpinx, 38 cases and 25 deaths. Since 1889 I find only four such cases of hematosalpinx which were cured (or disappeared) after cutting through the vaginal obstruction (2, 3, 10, 13) and one case (first of Horrock's cases [73] see remarks), which ended fatally. Of course, in this period of time, there is a large number of cases reported—and probably a great many more which were never reported—in which primary blood retentions in the single canal, without hematosalpinx, were successfully operated on from below (30 cases): [5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 24, 26, 28, 35, 36, 41, 42, 43, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 75, 76, 79]. One case [45] later required a double salpingo- oophorectomy; in two cases [69 and 80] the blood-sac was opened through a laparotomy wound; and in one case [62] a hydrosal- pinx was later punctured and emptied from below. The double genital canal is often the seat of blood reten- tions, usually in the form of hematometra unilateralis with or without hematosalpinx. Thus, Fuld reports four cases which terminated favorably, after puncture per vaginam, and 12 cases which died. Wagner (1896) was able to collect 43 cases, of unilateral hematometra with the following record: Cases. Died. Recovered. Not operated. 6 5 1 (?) Punctured or incised from below 26 10 16 Kehrer (1900) includes in his list of 12 cases of hematometra in a rudimentary accessory horn, one which was discovered at autopsy, one in which the blood-sac was emptied by com- pression and two which were emptied by puncture per vaginam. The others were treated by laparotomy and will be referred to later. In five of these 12 cases a hematosalpinx was said to

354 PAN AS' OPERATION FOR STRABISMUS. sided study of strabismus, whose correct impetus was initiated and elaborated by Helmholtz's introduction of the ophthalmo- scope in 1851. Not until this most important scientific addition to the study of the eye was there believed to be a connection between the anatomical depth and shallowness of the eyeball or between certain intrinsic diseases of the eye and refractive anomalies, now regarded as established facts; more than this, the importance of the angle a (alpha), of the depth of the fovea centralis, of the excess of rods and the absence of cones and of the large number of nerve cells and nerve fibres at the fovea, of the coordinate axes of vision, of disturbances in the cornea, lens and vitreous body, and lastly of the relative dynamic disparity between the ocular muscles themselves—I say, the importance of each and all of these points plays a role in the study of strabismus, unrecognized previously to the introduc- tion of the ophthalmoscope. Their knowledge is not only in- teresting, but important. In the light of successful achievement of a surgical act, however, their importance is secondary. The pertinent question, asked by this paper, is this: Shall one, about to undertake the care and responsibility of a case of established strabismus, with its accompaniment of limited vision, misplaced and distorted planes of vision, circumscribed and falsely projected fields of vision, loss of parallelism of axes of vision, and consequently loss of fixation point, inequalities of right and left vision, gradually increasing spaticity of the internal recti in convergent squint, gradually increasing deterioration of the internal recti in divergent squint, with the presence of headache, eye-strain of manifold character, stooping shoulders, and physical impairment of varied form—shall one allow his judgment to be primarily influenced by physiological and func- tional facts to such extent that, a simpler and less painful form of operation shall be selected, because, on the one hand, its simplicity and comparative lack of pains, and on the other hand, its possibility of completion at a later date, stand ever before him? Granted, that a surgical interference for the cure of strabismus ■ has been determined upon, is it not better to complete the sur- gical act in one session on both eyes, as the Panas' operation demands? It is in the end a saving of pain, a saving of time, and is attended with less expense—all factors of weight in every

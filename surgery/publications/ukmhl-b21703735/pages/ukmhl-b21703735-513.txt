417 CALMETTE OPHTHALMO-TUBERCULIN REACTION. reactionary symptoms usually develop in from eight to eighteen hours. The cornea, iris and deeper tissues are apparently not affected, nor has the writer noted any pupillary changes. The acute stage of the reaction usually passes off within a few hours, and the eye returns to normal in from one to four days. In some cases a mild conjunctivitis may remain for from two to three weeks. An attempt has been made to classify the different forms of reaction under several divisions, relative to the degree of inten- sity of the inflammatory changes. In any such classification, simplicity is much desired, and I would suggest that, if there is to be any division, it should be into two classes only, viz., mild (+) and severe (+ +). Any further division is not prac- tical and, furthermore, there is no definite evidence of any relation between the intensity of the reaction and the activity or the extent of tubercular involvement. Untoward Effects.—Several observers have reported unfavor- able results, such as long-continued conjunctivitis, keratitis, temporary loss of vision, and ulceration. The contraindica- tions are inflammatory affections of the eye and eyelids—con- junctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, iritis, and trachoma. If these are carefully avoided and the preparation used has been prop- erly prepared and a small drop used, there should be no ap- prehension of any unfavorable sequelae. Cases. Name. Age. Diagnosis.

After 1st instillation there was no reaction; the child cried at the time of instilla- lation. A decided rection followed the 2d and 3d in- stillations, which were given four weeks apart.

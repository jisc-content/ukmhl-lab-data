70 BLADDER WOUNDS IN HERNIA OPERATIONS. to be extra-peritoneal protrusion of the bladder. The sac open- ing was closed by purse-string suture and the bladder fastened well towards the center by suture through the fatty covering. The canal was closed by the Bassini method. The patient left the hospital on the 14th day perfectly healed. There was no recurrence one year later. Case XIX.—Extra-peritoneal (Card No. 1401), December 13, 1906. M. W., age 38 (referred by Dr. Abrams). Double in- guinal hernia; previous history not known. Operation was performed at Post-Graduate Hospital, Dr. Smith and staff assisting. On the right side a true direct sac was found, but the lower, and larger, part of the tumor was the bladder uncovered by peritoneum. The sac opening was closed by purse-string suture; the bladder was freed from adhesions and stitched by fatty coverings to the under surface of the internal oblique well towards the center of the abdomen, and the canal closed by the Bassini method. The patient left the hos- pital on the 14th day perfectly healed. Case XX.—Extra-peritoneal (Card No. 1442), March 16, 1907. A. J. C, age 45 (referred by Dr. S. G. Gant). Right com- plete inguinal hernia of supposed recent origin. Operation was performed at Murray Hill Sanitarium, Dr. George E. Doty assisting. A small oblique inguinal sac and some fat was found in upper part of the canal. Just above the pubic bone and inside of the cord was protruding a small, fatty tumor the size of a small English walnut. The anterior surface could be easily traced down to the bladder wall. The upper sac was removed, the bladder freed and pushed towards center of abdomen. The patient had some irritation of the bladder previous to operation, and on the following day developed a sharp cystitis, which lasted for nearly a week. As there was very little hand- ling of the bladder diverticulum, it is not known why the cystitis should have developed. BIBLIOGRAPHY. Cases 1. Curtis, B. F.: Annals of Surgery, June, 1895 58 2.

100 RUPTURE THROUGH CESAREAN CICATRIX. vaginal discharge. She was advised to come into the hospital at once, and was admitted about 11 p.m. The patient was very restless and thirsty; the skin was cold; the pulse was 104, of poor quality; the res- pirations 44, and the cervix admitted one finger only. The abdomen was distended with fluid and the fetus could easily be palpated under the abdominal wall. Her condition grew steadily worse, and laparotomy was performed within an hour after her admission to the hospital. The fetus and placenta had passed into the abdominal cavity, which was filled with blood and clots. The child, weighing 7j-$ lb. was still-born, and the patient died a few minutes after the incision was made. The rupture had occurred at the site of the old scar, but it is impossible to state when the laceration took place. There is, of course, the possibility that the patient had already reached full term one month before the estimated time, but the cervix admitted one finger only, and, if in labor at all, the accident must have occurred at the very onset.

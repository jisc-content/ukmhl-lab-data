400 GAS SEPSIS, EMPHYSEMA, OR PHLEGMONE. the genitourinary and the alimentary tracts are known portals of entry for the bacillus, it is a very difficult matter to determine positively through which channels the system becomes infected. The repeated hemorrhages from the genito-urinary tract in the second case would have a tendency to open the blood vessels and render entrance of the bacilli to the system easy by this route; while in the first case a similar condition might have ex- isted, in the uterine body so far as the blood vessels were con- cerned, and thus have established the portal of entry at that point.

420 CALMETTE OPHTHALMO-TUBERCULIN REACTION. very low condition and had but little resisting power. Death occurred a few days later, from which it may reasonably be inferred that the reactionary powers were at too low an ebb to respond to the test. Some investigators explain the negative reaction reported in cases known to be tubercular, as due to a condition of low resist- ance—low opsonic index—as occurs in the negative phase. This, the ivriter believes to be the case in such instances as the one just cited; but, in his opinion, the reactive powers, or the opsonic index, must be very low indeed to account for a negative reaction in cases of tubercular bone and joint disease. It is very important to make a thorough examination of the patient in order to eliminate sources of tubercular infection other than that of the bone or joint in question. I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. T. Homer Coffin for his continued assistance and cooperation in this work, without which many of the notes taken on the cases above cited would have been unavailable. I take this oppor- tunity also to thank Drs. H. L. Taylor, W. O. Plimpton and H. D. Chapin, from whose services at the Post-Graduate Hos- pital a number of these cases have been taken. BIBLIOGRAPHY.

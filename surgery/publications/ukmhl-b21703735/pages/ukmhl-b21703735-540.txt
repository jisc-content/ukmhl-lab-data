The similarity between them is apparent. It was possible also in many other respects to gather points which justify the application of the physiology of secretion in the dog to the human being. Thus, I obtained in the sham- feeding girl, in experimenting5 with 5% alcohol, the same re- sults as in dogs, i.e., a considerable increase in quantity but no increase in acidity beyond the normal limits.

It is true that sham feeding necessitates operative preparation* of the animal, and anatomically the individual is abnormal, but functionally we have to consider the individual as normal, for reasons which cannot be entered into here. Now, the question is whether the observations obtained, on the healthy stomach can be used as a basis for classification and explanation of secretory disturbances so often met in man. I do not know whether there have ever been observed in dogs diseases like 5. Kast: Archiv. fur Verdauungskrankh. 1906.

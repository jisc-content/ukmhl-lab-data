477 REPORT OF A CASE OF CHRONIC SPLENOMEGALIC POLYCYTHEMIA. BY ARTHUR F. CHACE, M.D. Adjunct Professor in Medicine, New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. The attention of the medical profession was first called to the condition known as chronic cyanosis with polycythemia, by H. Vaquez,1 in 1892. Since that time the condition has some- times been spoken of as Vaquez's Disease. Eleven years later Osier2 reported nine cases of this affection, of which five cases were collected from the literature and four were personal ob- servations. The folfowing year the same observer summarized 17 cases3. In the past five years about forty cases have been reported. Although several articles have recently been written upon this interesting disease, there is so little known concerning the con- dition that it was thought advisable to publish the following case, together with references to the recent literature on the subject. Miss E. W., age 17 years; schoolgirl; born in New York State; was referred to the New York Post-Graduate Hospital by Dr. Cora M. Ballard. The patient was admitted to the medical wards, August 19, 1907, and was under observation until Sep- tember 24, 1907, when she was discharged. Her family history was negative. The father, mother, four brothers and two sisters were living and well. Aside from measles in childhood, she had always been in good health. She takes a glass of beer or whisky occasionally, and also drinks two cups of coffee for breakfast, and averages two cups of tea each week. Menstrua- tion has never been established.

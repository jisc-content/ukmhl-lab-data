CICATRICIAL STRICTURE OF THE ESOPHAGUS. 439 4th. In impermeable strictures, where all attempts at divulsion have proved unsuccessful, a permanent valvular gastrostomy should be established. In conclusion, attention should be directed to the following points: 1. Forcible introduction of bougies, rapid instrumental divul- sion, internal esophagotomy with sharp cutting instruments, etc., are positively dangerous and should not be employed. 2. Before attempting any dilatation of an esophageal stric- ture, a guide-bougie or string-guide should be passed. 3. The treatment does not end with the operation. Stric- tures are prone to relapse; therefore, vigilant supervision must be maintained in each case until such tendency has disappeared.

219 MENTAL DEFICIENCIES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. absence of these defects, the little patients may gradually ac- quire a fair measure of intelligence. The same observations practically hold good for syphilitic idiocy. Tics and convulsions are not rare in both of these types of idiocy. The Mongolian idiot is a restless creature. Totally idiotic in early infancy, he gradually shows signs of improving mentality. He learns to appreciate his surroundings, and to make himself understood by a language of his own. He learns to run about at an earlier age than most other idiots, and not rarely shows destructive tendencies. Under suitable treatment cretins often attain a fair measure of intellectual development. Like hydrocephiles they are timid, gentle, and unassuming. They retain their childish tastes for a long time, and sometimes for life, if left untreated. In the latter respects infantilism differs little from cretinism. In infantilism, however, there is much greater control of the muscular system, and quicker response to medica- tion and training. Occasionally mixed forms of idiocy, genetous idocy (Fig. 11) are encountered which do not quite correspond to any of the types enumerated, demanding for their correct interpretation greater care and scrutiny and more elaborate methods of examination- Limitation of space, however, forbids further dilation upon the vast and complex subject in question.

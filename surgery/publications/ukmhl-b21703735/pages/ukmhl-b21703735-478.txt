384 MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. Under-sized, fairly well nourished. When standing, in order to have one foot completely in contact with floor, the knee of other (right especially) must be bent, and the heel of other foot raised from floor. The right foot is in a state of pes planus. He stands on toes, resting about two inches from floor (right higher than left). In walking he lands on the ball of each foot, and at the same time clutches the floor with flexed toes. The heel of right foot never touches floor, while that of left barely approximates it. Action at knee-joint is that typical of drop-foot. In turning he turns on tip toes. The weak- ness of extensors responsible for this gait is best shown when he attempts to squat. In proportion as his pelvis goes towards the ground, the heels come forward so that when he is in a complete squatting position he is on tip toes. When at rest, both feet are in a position of complete foot-drop. The knee and ankle jerks are both present. The rigidity of the head and neck and the upper part of the back is so pronounced that the position of the body is like that of spondylosis, but this is compensatory. Evidently a " sport " or sporadic case. Juvenile Type.â€”An unmarried paper-box maker, 34 years old. At the age of 31 he began to complain of weakness in the knees, which gradually increased so that he often fell, usually back- wards. About 18 months after this symptom came on, his friends remarked his peculiar gait. He swayed from side to side, and about this time he noticed a weakness of the left arm, and others noticed a change in the facial expression. The most interesting information about this patient was ob- tained many years after he came under observation, and that was that a sister had a similar disease. The status of the pa- tient and the characteristic features of the disease are best illustrated by the accompanying illustration (Fig. 10).

159 PRIMARY EPITHELIOMA OF THE VAGINA IN A PA- TIENT UNDER TWENTY YEARS OF AGE. BY GEORGE GRAY WARD, JR., M.D. Professor of Diseases of Women, New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. The following case was referred to me by Dr. F. W. Best, of Port Jervis, N. Y., and was admitted to my service at the Post- Graduate Hospital on February 13, 1908.

The external genitals were those of a nulipara and perfectly normal.

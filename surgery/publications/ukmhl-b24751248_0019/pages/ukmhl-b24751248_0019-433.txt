Pogciiale.â€”Report to the Academy of Medicine on various communica- tions relating to the question of the Pulverization of Mineral and Medicinal Waters. L'Union, Jan. 9th, p. 53 ; and Journ. cle Pbarm., vol. xli, p. ia^. After a general resume of the researches of MM. Sales-Girons, Pietra-Santa, Auphan, Demarquay, Pournie, Tavernier, Tarnpier, and others, (see last 'Tear Book'), the author gives the results of the re- searches and experiments undertaken by the commission on mineral waters for the purpose of determining the various questions at issue. As regards the penetration of pulverized liquids, two series of experiments were made, the first on animals, the second on the human subject. In the first series a rabbit was made to inspire a solution of perchloride of iron (1 per cent.) during five minutes. On killing the animal immedi- ately after, the presence of the salt was demonstrated in the parenchyma of the lungs and throughout the whole respiratory system. The.se experiments were repeated with various forms of apparatus, but with unvarying results. The second series of experiments were made on a nurse at the Beaujon hospital, who breathes through a canula. The experiments consisted in closing the laryngeal aperture with a pledget, on the inside of which was fixed a piece of paper moistened with solution of chloride of iron. A solution of tannin in 100 parts of water was then respired by the patient, the penetration of which into the air-passages was shown by the blackening of the paper. To ensure the success of the experiment, the tongue must be in such a position as to admit of the patient's breathing freely through the mouth, and the laryngeal opening must be closed air-tight; the fulfilment of the latter 28

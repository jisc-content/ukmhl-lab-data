221 VENEREAL DISEASES. 1853 inclusive there were 278 cases in Berlin, according to the registers oi'the veterinary school of that city ; that in 1854 it was decided that all dogs should be muzzled, a measure which has since been strictly carried ou°, with the effect that there have been, not only at the veterinary school, hut in all the city, in 1854, four cases ; in 1855, one case ; in T856, one case; and in 1857, 1858, 1859, i860, i86i,none; a result which requires no commentary. M. Trousseau gave a clinical lecture on a case in which the symptom, long since noted by Caelius Aurelianus, satyriasis, was most marked; he also mentioned four cases he had previously seen, and some others simulating this disease, but really arising from mental impressions (' Gaz. d. Hop.,' 1861, p. 45). Another case, in which the subcutaneous injection of atropine failed, occurred under M. Guillot (ib., p. 454). GLANDER3. Zimmermann has published a paper, of nearly 200 pages, on four cases of this disease ; two of which, he thinks, were caused by contagion through a volatile poison (' Arch. f. Path. Anat.,' xxiii, 209). MALIGNANT PUSTULE. Dr. H. Wald has carefully examined the causes of this affection in animals (Schmidt's ' Jahrb.,' cxvi, 136), and has found that neither climate, height above the sea, nor geological formation, has any direct connection with it. He found, however, that it never prevailed endemically among animals, except where the land was very wet (marshy) and more or less abounding in organic detritus. He failed in finding an explanation for its non-occurrence in some marsh districts. Dr. W. Budd ('Med. Times and Gaz.,' 1862, ii, 163) has collected nine cases of this disease, which, according to him, is not so uncommon in England as has been supposed. All the cases terminated fatally in from four to eight days. A case and some further remarks are to be found in the same journal (p. 195); another case, treated by amputation near the shoulder, is reported by F. Jordan (ib., p. 323); and one com- mencing on the penis, by Mr. Harper (' Lancet,' 1862, ii, 228). WOUNDS BY SERPENTS. M. Guyon reports a case of bite by the horned viper {Cerastes JEgyp- tiacus), in which there was hemiplegia of the opposite side to that wounded ; recovery was perfect, except as to the paralysis. Dr. Hussa has observed twenty-eight cases of viper-bites, three of which ended in death (• Allg. Wien. Med. Zeit.,' 1861, No. 32). A work on the serpents of la Vendue, by A. Viaud-Grandmarais is reviewed in the ' Gaz. Hebd.' (1861, p. 772). VENEREAL DISEASES. •Syphilidology or the most Recent Discoveries,' &c, edited by F. Behrend, 2nd series, vol. hi (Erlangen), a journal principally filled with translations or extracts from other sources, yet of use as a collection of nearly all that has been recently published of importance on the subject.

Zeitsch.,' vii, 25, 26).—When the joint has become relaxed through disease, -when the tissues holding the bones in contact have lost their firmness, elasticity, and contractility, -when the ordinary conditions of pressure by the air and blood have become modified, no external force is required to drive the head of the femur out of its socket, —normal motions, and especially adduction and rotation inwards, are quite competent to produce the dislocation. Any disease, such as enchondroma, cancer of the ilium or of the head of the femur, may relax the parts through which the bones are connected together, and may thus be the essential condition of the luxation ; by far the most common cause is, however, inflammation of the joint, the so-called coxitis. Secondary luxation may occur at any stage of the latter disease. In the first stage of hip-joint disease, all the tissues become saturated with, exudation, and thus lose entirely, or at all events partially, their firmness, elasticity, and power of contraction. The cartilage' on the acetabulum and femur becomes opaque, inelastic, and soft; its cells change at last iuto connective-tissue-corpuscles ; the cotyloid ligament is transformed into a yielding, loosely connected, fibrous band ; the round • ligament is reduced to a thread-like remainder, liable to rupture on the

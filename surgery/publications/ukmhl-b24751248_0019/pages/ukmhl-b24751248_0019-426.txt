REPORT ON .MIDWIFERY, ETC. '111 These results agree generally with those previously placed on record by Barensprung. The elevation of temperature in question was noticed equally when the infant had and had not taken food. Temperature during the first nine days of life : _ .1)3.

Then a fall takes place which reaches its maximum at four days afterbirth (average maximum 29-68° E.). Again, between the fifth and eighth days, a new elevation of temperature occurs; but this new elevation is less in degree than that previously noted. The average maximum observed was 29-83° E. The results obtained were here slightly different from those of Barensprung who has noted the second elevation as occurring from the sixth to the eighth days, and the elevation reached was greater, viz., to 30'35°. The author believes that the difference is owing to the comparatively small number of cases observed by Barensprung. In individual cases a considerable variation from the average may be observed. This difference amounts, according to Eorster, between the second and ninth day of life, to v6° E. The average of the whole series of observations on healthy children for the period between the second and ninth day was 29*79° E. Some differ- ences were found in the results, according as the infants were large and heavy, or the reverse : large and well-developed children had a slightly higher temperature than those less robust. Thus, the average tem- perature in the early part of the day was, in children weighing eight pounds and upwards, 29-84° E., but in children weighing less than this, the average was 29-65°. The evening observations again gave an average for the heavy children of 29-94°; for the others, of 29-77°. Respecting the temperature at different times of the day, observa- tions showed that from the second to the ninth day there was an average elevation of temperature from morning to evening amounting to -i i° E.; the average morning temperature being 29-75° E. 5 the average evening temperature 29-86° E.

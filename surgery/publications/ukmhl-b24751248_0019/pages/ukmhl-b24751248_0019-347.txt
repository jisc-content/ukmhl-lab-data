A curve would thus represent the frequency of the heart-beat, the curve being deepest during the interval between the fourth and eighth month. The child was a male, and some observations made after birth showed that the heart continued to beat oftener in the morning than in the evening, as had been the case during its intra-uterine life. Hutee.— On the Foetal Pulse. Mon. f. Geb., supplementary part, 1861, p. 23. Considering that still-birth is occasionally due to too great duration of labour, the author puts to himself the question, how long should we wait before applying the forceps, in cases where the forceps are applicable ? And in order to answer this question, he resolved to inves- tigate anew, as a necessary preliminary, the relation of the foetal pulse. Authorities differ on this point materially. Observations were under- taken at the Lying-in Institution at Marburg, the method of Schwartz, viz., counting the number of pulsations during an interval of five seconds, being the one adopted. The observations, 1195 in number, were made at periods of pregnancy from one week to nineteen weeks before labour set in; the results of observations in each of the intervening weeks are minutely set down, and note is made as to whether the foetus moved or not during the observation. In 825 observations the number of beats was 11 in the five seconds ; in 310 the number of beats exceeded 11, but in 73 of these latter the frequency was attributable to movements of the foetus. In 60 cases the number of beats was under 11, but never less than 10. Hence the general result, that 132 is the figure which represents the number of beats of the foetal heart per minute. Further observations gave this result, that the number of beats during the com- mencement of labour, and previous to that time, was identical. The per-centage of frequency is thus expressed: 12 Beats per five seconds in 10 per cent, of cases. 11 » » 83 „ ,, *o ,, „ 7 » » The author states that his results slightly differ from those obtained by Schwartz, his own figure being 11, that of Schwartz 12. Is this difference, he asks, attributable to the fact that Schwartz's observations were made at Kiel, the northern extremity of Germany, and his (Huter's) in a different locality, much further to the south ? The dif- ferences in the statements of other observers might possibly have a corresponding origin. "When, in a particular case, the normal number of beats is eleven, and we find it to be raised to twelve, this is in asso- ciation with movements on the part of the foetus ; and if these movements are excessive, the number of beats may rise to fifteen, and, indeed, may

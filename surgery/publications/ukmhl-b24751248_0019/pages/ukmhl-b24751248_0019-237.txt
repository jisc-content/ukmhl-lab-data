225 SYPHILIS. we succeed in producing pustules by the lancet, until at last inoculation Mill be quite fruitless. If now we cover the sore with (Sharpie, and do not renew it, there will be at the end of twenty-four hours an abundant secretion of matter, thicker and purulent, the inoculation of which will give positive results in most cases. It is probable that the numerous fruitless inoculations reported by authors were made in the later stage, and without the necessary precautions." In phagedsenic chancre Boeck employs the actual cautery. The principal results from his statistics are :— 1083 primary cases were treated by mercury, the mean duration of the treatment was sixty days ;* 626 primary cases were treated without mer- cury, the mean duration of the treatment was forty days ; and from 1852 to 1861 inclusive, 254 were treated by external remedies, the mean time of treatment was thirty-seven days; 24 per cent, of those treated by mercury for primary syphilis have had constitutional syphilis ; 14 per cent, of those treated from 1826 to 1852 without mercury for primary syphilis, have had constitutional syphilis; 11 per cent, of those treated from 1852 to 1861 inclusive, without mercury for primary syphilis, have had constitutional syphilis. 3200 persons were treated for constitutional syphilis by mercury, the mean time of treatment was 125 days; but 77 persons who died during the first treatment ought not to be counted ; and thus the true result is that 3123 persons were treated, and that the mean duration of the treat- ment was 126 days. 1036 of the above 3123 have had returns of the disease, that is, 33 per cent., but a good number having had several returns, the total number of returns is 1615. 108 persons died, 77 during the first treatment. 316 persons were treated without mercury (by the old methods), the mean time of treatment was 101 days; but 33 persons, who died during the first treatment, ought not to be counted, and, consequently, the true result is that 283 persons were treated, and that the mean duration of the treatment was 106 days. 82 of the 283 had returns of the disease, i. e. 28 per cent.; many of them had several returns, the total number of returns being 119. 265 persons were treated for the first constitutional affection by syphi- lisation, the mean time of treatment was 134 days. 22 of the 265 (19 of whom were infants with hereditary syphilis), dying during the first treatment, ought not to be counted, and the true result, consequently, is that 243 individuals were treated, and that the mean duration of the treatment was 143 days. The treatment by syphilisation was begun in 1852. 27 persons of the 243 had returns of the disease, i.e. 11 per cent. 77 persons were treated by derivation, the mean time of the treatment was 184 days. The treatment by derivation was commenced in 1856. 19 persons have had returns, i.e. 24 per cent. 22. persons have been treated by the sudorific method conjointly with strict regimen and decoction of sarsaparilla; the mean duration of the I treatment was 107 days. The sudorific treatment was commenced, in I 1861. 7 of these have had returns, i. e. 31 per cent. 237 primary affections, acquired after a constitutional syphilis previously ■ treated by mercury or by one of the old methods, have demanded for their * Fractions are omitted throughout. 15

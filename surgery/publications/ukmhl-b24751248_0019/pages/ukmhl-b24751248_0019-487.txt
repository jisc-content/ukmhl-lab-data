L'Union, July 31st, p. an. This paper is founded on experiments on animals, and on numerous observations of the lungs of mature foetuses before and after breathing. His conclusions are as follows:—When the lung of the mature foetus is examined with a lens, the surface of each lobule exhibits, if respiration has taken place, the appearance of " a collection of very distinct, rounded vesicles, each having its luminous point, which are closely wedged to- gether, and differ in size." The absence of these characters affords, according to M. Bouchut, a reliable indication that the infant has not breathed. Szymanowski.—Suffocation or Brandy ? Helsingfors, 1861, 8vo, pp. 88. Schmidt, vol. 113, p. 362. On the 3rd of December, about 3 p.m., a sailor, aged 29, returned to his quarters excessively drunk, and was placed in confinement for his noisy and riotous behaviour; As he continued to make a great noise, he was ordered to be placed in a sitting posture on a bench, witli his hands tied to a post behind him, and a gag in his mouth. The latter consisted of a round stick, an inch thick and nine inches long, and was kept in its place by a string attached to either end, and tied behind so as not to press on the sides of the neck, but on the nnpe. A quarter of an hour after this instrument was put on, he was found dead. On dissection, the body exhibited the signs of asphyxia, without any indication of external violence. In the opinion of the expert who made the inspection, the immoderate use of alcohol had mainly contributed to the arrest of the' functions of respiration, which was the immediate cause of death, by the induction of congestion and impaired innervation of the lungs ; but he was unwilling to express a decided opinion that the gag had anything to do with the result, for it could be shown that breathing was not at all

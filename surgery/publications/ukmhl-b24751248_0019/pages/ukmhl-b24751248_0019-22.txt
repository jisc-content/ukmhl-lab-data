EEPOBT ON PHYSIOLOGY. 10 The common bile-duct was divided, after a double ligature Lad been applied ; and a fistulous opening was established between the skin and the gall-bladder. An accurately weighed sponge was affixed to the opening; and in this all secreted bile was caught. In the first series of experi- ments, which lasted seven days, the dog was daily fed on 2^00 grammes of lean horseflesh, without any water. The weight of the animal increased during the time from 12,820 grammes to 14,000 grammes, and the average quantity of bile, which was daily secreted, amounted to 2ly<; grammes. This gives (taking 13,629 grammes to bo the mean weight of the dog) 18-75 grammes of bile for each kilogramme of the animal in twenty-four hours. A second series of experiments, which lasted eight days, and in which the dog was fed on the same amount of lean horseflesh as above, yielded very nearly the same results. The dog was then fed daily during five days on 2000 grammes of horseflesh. 220-15 grammes of bile were secreted daily on the average; which gives (for a mean weight of 14,520 grammes) 15-2 grammes of bile per diem to each kilogramme of the animal. During five other days the dog received 1500 grammes per diem. The weight of its body maintained itself almost unaltered. 196- ■■; grammes of bile were daily secreted, which, for a mean weight of 14,544 grammes, gives 13 -\ grammes of bile to each kilogramme in twenty-lour hours. The weight of the body decreased, whilst the dog was fed during four days with 1000 grammes of flesh only. 148'1 grammes of bile were daily secreted, or, for a mean weight of 14,175 grammes, 10*5 grammes for each kilogramme in twenty-four hours. Though the quantity of bile diminished absolutely with the decrease in the quantity of food, relatively it in- creased. In the first, third, fourth, and fifth series of experiments the quantities of food taken bore the following proportions—5, 4, 3, 2 ; but the quantities of bile for 1000 grammes of meat were as—10, 11, 13, 15. The dog was fed at 7 a.m. with 450 grammes of half-dried horseflesh and 300 cubic centimetres of water. In the first hour after the meal 12*1 grammes of bile were secreted; then the quantity secreted during each hour decreased, till in the fifth hour 5-5 grammes only were pro- duced. In the sixth hour a second maximum was attained, amounting to 7-8 grammes, from which time the quantity slowly diminished, till in the evening it was 6*3 grammes. This experiment was repeated several times with similar results. Eitter 'attributes the rapid increase in the secretion of bile, shortly after food has been taken, partly to the water getting into the circula- tion, partly to the acceleration of the circulation, and partly to the pressure exerted by the full stomach upon tho liver and bile-ducts. The less the amount of food which has been taken the sooner.the second maximum in the secretion occurs. At the end of twenty-four hours after a rich meal the bile continued to be secreted in greater quantity, than it did at the same period after a poor meal. To determine the influence which the addition of fat to the food exerts on the secretion of bile, the dog was fed during two days with 1000 grammes of meat and 125 grammes of fat per diem, then during one day

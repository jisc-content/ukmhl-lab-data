413 DISEASES OF INFANTS. PAET III.—DISEASES OE INFANTS. Mollee.—Cases of Acute Rachitis. Konigsb. Med. Jahrb., 1862, p. 135. Two cases are related in detail, the first that of an infant fourteen months old, the second that of a child one and three quarter years old. In both cases the great vascularity of the affected bones was noticed, and also great tendency to bleeding. The pain felt in both cases was very great. Eoestek.—Tkermometric Observations on Children. .Tourn. f. Kind., July and Aug., 1862, p. jj. As an indication of the intensity and character of the disease in febrile attacks, the frequency of the pulse is little to be depended on in the case of children. On the other hand variations in the tempera- ture of the body offer more certain indications. This was, long ago, maintained in general terms by Hippocrates and Galen, but practically it has not been utilized. The author is engaged in an extended series of observations on this subject, some of the results of which are here given. The instrument used was a Eeaumur's thermometer, twenty- three centimetres (eight and a half inches) long, in which slight varia- tions are easily appreciable. The bulb of the thermometer was placed in the axilla, this part of the body being considered to give the best indications as regards temperature. The results now given are those of observations made during health and during the first days of life. A constant lowering of the temperature of the body takes place after birth. This lowering of temperature reaches its maximum, on an average, within the first two hours after birth (28-97° Eeaum.). Hours after birth. Average temperature. Minimum temperature.

Sometimes the minimum is readied a little later than this ; the minimum itself is lower, and the whole stage of low temperature is more protracted in asphyxiated and weak children than in children who are strong and breathe well. A subsequent elevation of temperature always occurs. The average time at which the highest temperature was observed was from thirty to thirty-six hours after birth. The average temperature at the time'was 30-07° E.; the highest was 30-4°, the lowest 29-7°. The average amount of elevation within rather more than thirty hours was ri° Eeaum.

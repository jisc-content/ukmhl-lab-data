270 REPORT ON SURGERY. under trentnicnt; tlie mortality being nearly <Jo per cent. In 25 eases of fracture with depression, no operation was performed ; 7 died, 18 recovered, or a mortality of 28 per cent. Of fractures without depression there were 38, of which 25 were sub- jected to operation and 13 were not; of the former 13 died, 12 recovered; of the latter 5 died, 8 recovered. Thirty-four cases with depressed bone, but without symptoms of com- pression, were operated on ; of these 22 recovered, and 12 died ; this series should probably be much greater. Of cases styled protrusion or hernia of the brain, there were 35 reported—17 died, 18 recovered. Of wound or laceration of the brain, 27 cases—18 died, 9 recovered. In all 62 cases, with 35 deaths. In 66 cases of fracture of the base of the skull, 46 died, 20 recovered, or a mortality of about 69 per cent. According to the accounts of the post-mortem examinations in the 46 cases, the following were the situations of the fractures:—of the middle fossa alone there were 11 cases; of the anterior 10 ; of the posterior 2 ; of the anterior and middle 4 ; of the posterior and middle 9 ; one of these had separation of the coronal suture. There were 5 cases of fracture running into each of the three fossse; 3 of these had, in addition, sepa- ration of the coronal suture. There were 5 cases in which the precise locality was not described. In a case of fracture of the frontal bone, observed by Dr. Murney, there were, besides ecchymosis of the eyelids and conjunctiva, two small con- tused wounds on the left side of the face, one beneath the outer, the other beneath the inner canthus, from which there was for some hours con- tinuous bleeding, followed for twenty-four hours by copious weeping of serum. The post-mortem examination showed «in addition to other mis- chief a fracture of the base, which passed through the orbital process, and the sphenoid, and ended in the basilar process of the occipital, half an inch in front of the foramen magnum.

289 MOUTH. that period, the cells ossify more and more, and in old age the bony wall between the sinus and the cells is a line or more thick and composed of very dense tissue. It is clear that the ease, with which inflammation will spread from the cells of the mastoid process to the sinus, will depend on the thickness of the septum of bony tissue; and since the latter is the thinnest between the years of eighteen and forty-five, it will be at that period that inflammatory affections of the ear will be most dangerous. In early childhood otorrhcea is very common, and yet such extensions of the disease do not ensue, because the bony wall between the sinus and the mastoid cavities, although spongy, is of considerable thickness. Dr. Voltolini has published a series of papers on the ear-surgery of the present day, in which he reviews the writings of Erliard, Toynbee, Kramer, Wilde, Ran, and Trb'ltsch ('Deuts.

As soon as Langenbeck had shown, that portions of the upper jaw could be sawn out and again healed in; and that such operations might occasionally be employed with great advantage for the purpose of gaining access to deeply situated parts, it was a simple matter to imagine a similar operation on the lower jaw for the purpose of removing tumours placed far back in the mouth and pharynx. Case 1.—P. C—, set. 46, consulted Dr. Billroth in April, 1861, for an epithelial cancer of the floor of the mouth and under surface of the tongue ; it had commenced in the frtenum ; the submaxillary glands were not enlarged. The patient's mouth was small, the jaw projected for- wards, and the teeth were long and perfect. An incision was made along the lower margin of the jaw; the mouth was opened from below; and ]9

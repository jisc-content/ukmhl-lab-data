265 EXCISIONS. an inch of bone by the saw, with tbe following brilliant result, which he thus describes : " Fifteen months have now elapsed since the day of the accident; she walks with scarcely any perceptible lameness ; the motions of the joint are as free as ever ; the deformity is almost none; callus has apparently been thrown out to form an inner and an outer malleolus ; and whether there is simply that ligamentous union between the tibia and astra- galus which Sir Astley Cooper describes as the result of his experiment on a dog, or whether we have in this case, as I am almost disposed to be- lieve, restored cartilages and a new synovial membrane, I leave to your superior judgment to determine." The patient was a girl of ten; Mr. Garrawny appears inclined to recommend, that in irreducible com- pound dislocations of the ankle-joint, enough of the tibia and fibula should be removed, to prevent contact with the astragalus after reduction, there- by to avert anchylosis and ensure a movable joint ('Brit.

PSYCHIATEIK. 93 Austin and Duchemin.—Behaviour of the Pupils in General Paralysis. Aimal. Med.-Psych., ze sei\, Jan. 1862. Schmidt's Jahrb., vol. 116, p. 241. Between the state of the iris and the mental condition of the patient as regards delirium, there exists an intimate connexion. If both eyes are equally and moderately affected, there is no delirium. If the disturbance hi the eyes are marked, and are alike in both, the delusive ideas are mingled or alternating. If both pupils are affected, but the one more than the other, the delirium is of a mixed kind, but so that melancholy ideas predominate when the right pupil is chiefly deranged, and maniacal excitement and ambition when the left suffers. The condition of the pupils is not con- stantly the same, but varies with the phenomena of the disease. The State of Lunacy in Ireland. Med. Critic and Psycholog. J., Jan. 1862. The question whether insanity is on the increase in Ireland cannot be answered with certainty. An apparent increase there certainly is, but the following circumstances will perhaps account for it without admitting that the chsease is actually more frequent. (1) The life of the insane is prolonged by the greater care taken of them. (2) Various mental states are now considered indicative of lunacy, which formerly were not. (3) The public are less averse to acknowledge the existence of insanity in their connexions than formerly. (4) Emigration has greatly diminished the general population, but not the lunatic. The total number of lunatics, idiots, imbeciles, and epileptics existing in Ireland, exclusive of those con- fined in asylums, gaols, and workhouses, amounted in April 1st, 1861, to 8991, of whom 4959 were males and 4032 females. The number of luna- tics, idiots, and epileptics in the union workhouses, at the same date was 2534> 965 beillg males, and 1569 females. The total number of patients in asylums during the year ending March 31st, 1861, was 5437. During the two last years the number of absolute recoveries was 1201, and 298 were discharged improved, and 127 unimproved, on the requirement of fcheir friends. In 6o-u per cent, of the total number of recoveries, asylum-treatment had been had recourse to within four months from the appearance of the disease. Moral causes appear to produce insanity among females in a higher ratio than among males, 532 : 368 ; while the reverse is the case with physical influences, the ratio being 505 : 286. Hereditary transmission was traceable in 495 cases, and the same with intemperance was accused as the cause in 818 out of 2186. As to the educational con- dition it appears that only 266 are well educated, 625 read and write well, 974 indifferently, while fifty-six per cent, are uneducated. Billod.—On Lesion of Association of Ideas. Ann. Med. Pyschol. 2°ser Qct. 1861. Med. Critic and Psycholog. J., Jan. 1862. Billod, after pointing out various ways in which our ideas are associated remarks that there is one fundamental distinction between them, viz., that Bome are merely accidental, depending on chance, or accident, while in others the ideas are necessarily corrected, and have, it may be said, constant rela- tions. The habit of associating the ideas in accordance with accidental

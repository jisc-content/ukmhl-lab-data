EYE. 273 the malar into the spheno-maxillary fissure, and then from the latter the orbital process of the maxilla to the lachrymal bone. This portion of the jaw now remained in connection only with the nasal hones and the nasal process of the frontal. An elevator was placed under the malar bone, and the piece was slowly raised forwards, until the malar was nearly in the middle of the face. The tumour was completely exposed: after its removal the portion of the jaw was replaced, and the wounds of the skin united with sutures. The operation lasted an hour. The traumatic fever ceased on the fifth day; and on the seventeenth the wounds were com- pletely healed. On the 17th July, a similar case was operated in the same way, and with success. Langenbeck concludes that; 1, to render tumours of the naso-pharyn- geal cavity and of the neighbouring parts accessible, it is sufficient to partially resect the upper jaw, without removing the hard palate and alveolar process : 2, in future, extirpation of the whole jaw for this pur- pose should be abandoned : 3, it is possible to saw through the jaw hori- zontally from the spheno-palatine foramen: 4, a portion of the jaw, so resected, and restored to its natural position, may unite again.

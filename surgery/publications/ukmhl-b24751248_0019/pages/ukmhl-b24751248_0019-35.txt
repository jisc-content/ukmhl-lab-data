23 BLOOD, LYMPH, AND CHYLE. more easily out of this than out of serum. These investigations were made with great care, and the most exact methods were employed. "* The experiments of "Weiss were performed on foals and dogs, which had been made insensible by means of opium or chloroform. He ascertained, with the aid of the manometer, the amount of pressure which was exerted by the lymph-current upon the walls of the right truncus trachealis. It was found to measure in foals from 10 to 20 millimetres of a solution of soda of ro8o specific gravity ; in dogs, from 5 to 20 millimetres. Cal- culation showed that the average velocity of the lymph-current in the truncus trachealis of foals was 4 millimetres in the second. The quan- tity of lymph which passed by with the current was "65 gramme in the minute, which quantity amounts to one fifth of the weight of the corresponding part of the body in twenty-four hours. Three series of experiments, which were performed on different foals for the purpose of determining the quantity of lymph which passed through the upper end of their thoracic duct, yielded the following results:— 84*2 grammes for the first foal, 97*8 grammes for the second, and 185-5 f°r *ne third, as the average quantity in twenty-four hours for one kilogramme of their weight. After Weiss had accomplished his experiments, large quantities of lymph and chyle were still obtained, which led C. Schmidt to subject them to careful chemical examination. Lymph was taken from the lymphatic trunk of the right side of the neck of a foal which had been well fed with hay.—The animal weighed 98*3 kilogrammes; head and neck alone, 13-9 kilogrammes. In 100 minutes 69-864 grammes of lymph were procured, which is for one kilo- gramme in twenty-four hours 10-23 grammes ; 1 kilogramme, head and neck of the same side, in twenty-four hours, i44'8 grammes.

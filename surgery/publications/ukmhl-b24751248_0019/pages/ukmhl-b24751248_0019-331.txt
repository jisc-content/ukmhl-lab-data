" In marked disease of the bladder, cystitis with constitutional disturb- ance, tumours simple or malignant, or if the existence of sacculi may be suspected, lithotrity is generally inadmissible. " Finally, for cases of either class where the stone is of extremely large size, such as are now rarely met with,—say from four ounces upwards,— I doubt whether experience can indicate on the whole a safer method tban the lateral operation. We have seen Mr. Crichton's results— viz., eleven cases with two deaths. At University College Hospital, Mr. Liston employed a double incision of the prostate—an incision of the right lobe as well as of the left—in lateral lithotomy, for nine cases of unusually large stone, losing two. The high operation offers, per- haps, as good a chance, if the bladder be distensible, and the patient is not corpulent. Data, however, are wanting to determine the value of this as well as that of the recto-vesical operation in relation to extremely large stones. "Such, then, are the general principles, which extended observation and experience indicate, in my opinion, to be our guides in selecting the proper operation for given cases. Nevertheless, it is not presumed, that every example can be brought to rule and measure, so to speak, and be mathematically fitted to the process requisite for it. Let it be well understood, that they are held forth as principles to indicate the way, not as rigid laws knowing no exception. By some, I am aware, I shall be charged with limiting the application of lithotrity. No doubt more is possible by that process. I doubt whether it is prudent to push it fur- ther. It must be our aim to reduce the stones to the process—that is, to detect them early, and consequently small, rather than to extend the pi-ocess to large and compact stones." Dr. W.

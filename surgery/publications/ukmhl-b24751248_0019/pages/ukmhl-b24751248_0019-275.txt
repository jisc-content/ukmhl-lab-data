263 JOINTS. or in other words, the head of the femur becomes extracapsular in the one, remains intracapsular in the other. The stage of hip-disease, at which the luxation takes place, is of importance in regard to the prognosis and treatment. In the first stage the condition of the joint most resembles that of health; the dislocation presents some, and occasionally great, difficulty in reduction; on the other hand, it is less liable to recur. In the second and still more the third stage, the bone slips readily in, but also just as easily out. Occa- sionally there are difficulties in reduction, such as from retraction of the glutseus medius and maximns, or from osteophytes. Reduction should not be undertaken, when there is still an inflammatory condition, when the head of the bone or acetabulum is sensitive, when the muscles are firmly retracted, or when there is too great an amount of caries. In the reduction, the patient is placed on his back and chloroformed ; the pelvis is fixed by an assistant, and the operator flexes, abducts, and rotates the femur outwards in the same way, as when a traumatic dislocation is reduced by the hand. After reduction the joint must be kept for weeks or even months at perfect rest. Prof. Dittel has followed this plan of treatment in two cases. Mr. Hilton has in three cases reduced pathological dislocations of the hip (' Lancet,' 1861, ii, 587, and 1862, ii, 2) : in all three, anchylosis took place after reduction. Prof. v. Dumreicher has in two cases of patho- logical dislocation of the hip excised the joint (' Canstatt,' 1861, v, 254). M. Trousseau in a clinical lecture on chronic rheumatic arthritis ('Gaz. d. Hop.,' 1861, p. 56^, and in abstract in the 'Lancet,' 1861, ii, 559) states that he has found the tincture of iodine, in large doses, and continued for months, or even years, of great service.

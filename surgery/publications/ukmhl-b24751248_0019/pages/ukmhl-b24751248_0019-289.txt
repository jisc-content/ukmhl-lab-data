EYE. 377 case of Jessop, the trace of this skin can only be detected in a good light. In two other cases the situation of former fraena can only be seen on minute inspection. In the case of Spence, operated on last March, the edges of the opacity have become transparent, and the remaining portion is atrophied, and but little raised above the level of the surrounding cornea. A case of Mr. Teale's operation performed by Mr. Hulke, is recorded in the 'Med. Times and Gaz.' (1862, ii, 33).

Opth.,' viii, 1, p. 94).—According to Dr. Weber, the following forms of disease are cured by the method of Bowman : 1, all cases of stricture of the lachrymal canals from inflammatory causes ; 2, cases of valvular or fold-like stricture at the junction of the sac with the nasal duct, provided there is little or no secretion of mucus or pus ; in such cases the sac is often found to be diminished in size; 3, obstructions at the point where the nasal duct enters the nostril; 4, perhaps even cases of complete obliteration of the lachrymal passages, such as occur after obliteration of the sac by the actual cautery; at least Dr. Weber has succeeded in rendering the lachrymal passages permeable in such a case and with much benefit to the patient.

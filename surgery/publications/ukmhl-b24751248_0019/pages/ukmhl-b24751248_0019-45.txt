3 REPORT ON PEACTICAL MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY. BV CHARLES HANDFIELD JONES, M.B., Cantab., F.R.S., FELLOW OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS ; PHYSICIAN TO ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL ; ETC. GENERAL PATHOLOGY. Demme, H. (Schweiz, Mon. Schr. iii, p. 161, 1858). Erichsen, J. (Virch. Arch, xxi, p. 405, 1861).—On Acute Miliary Carcinoma. Schmidt's Jahrb., vol. 113, p. 42. Demme defines this affection as a copious simultaneous deposit of small cancerous granulations, varying from the size of a hemp-seed to that of a pea, which takes place rapidly, with more or less violent febrile symptoms on the surface, and in the parenchyma of the most various internal organs. Demme gives seven cases in all, in which the acute deposit was secondary. Kohler and Bamberger have, however, published instances of its primary occurrence, (v. Krebs und Scheinkrebskrank- heiten, 1853, p. 110. Oesterrh.-Ztschr. f. prakt. Heilk. iii, 1857.) The pleuraa are one of the favourite seats of the deposit; they were affected in all Demme's and Bamberger's cases. The granulations are always of encephaloid character, even when the primary disease is of some other, as scirrhus. In one of Demme's cases, miliary cancerous deposit was found in a large old coagulum in the right auricle. The duration of the acute miliary affection is estimated by Demme at about six days. One of Erichsen's cases was secondary to mammary cancer, the other was probably primary peritoneal. Cohnheim, Jul,.—On Inflammation of the Se?-ous Membranes. Virchow's Arch, xxii, 1861.

The changes produced are,—that the epithelial cells become enlarged, round, and fatty, lose their nucleus and their envelope, are detached and thrown off; while the connective tissue corpuscles of the subjacent tissues for some depth proliferate and produce an abundant formation of mono- or poly-nucleated pus cells.

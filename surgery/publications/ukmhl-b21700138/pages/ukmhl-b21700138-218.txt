CLINICAL PAPERS. 202 in the early application of the forceps. If my explanation of the occurrence of this lesion is correct, then it is clearly bad practice to delay ap})lying forceps to a partially rotated occipito-posterior head. Why are these sinuses not recognised ? (a) Although, after a forceps case, every careful practitioner will examine tlie vagina, yet he will prol)ably fail to detect the lesion, as the opening, if there is one at all, will be very small, the injury being the result of pressure, and the slough not separating for S(jine days. (6) Because such injuries cause l)ut little pelvic disturbance, and the attention of the accoucheur is not attracted to the pelvis, and, no vaginal examination l^eing made, the injury remains unobserved. To sum upâ€” 1. A partially rotated occii)ito-posterior position is the least common of the various forms of occipito-posterior position. 2. Such an occipito-posterior position is usually associated with a degree of minor disproportion of the pelvis. 3. A very frequent if not invariable result is tlie forma- tion of a more or less deep vaginal sinus. 4. The situation of this sinus is over the right ischial spine. 5. The extent and depth of the sinus depends on tlie length of time that the pressure has been exerted ; though a very short period of pressure is sufficient to cause a sinus. G. These sinuses do not cause very much constitutional disturbance, and their existence is often overlooked, because no vatjfinal examination is made. o 7. The prevention of sucli injuries is to be found in an early use of the forceps.

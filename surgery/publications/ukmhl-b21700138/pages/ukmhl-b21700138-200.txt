The Causation of some Primitive Face Cases. It is seldom in private practice that the plivsician has an opportunity of oljserving the pregnant woman for some weeks l)cfore delivery, and noting the changes which take place during the period immediately preceding parturition. Even in tlie i\Iaternity Hospital such observations are not very easily carried out, because the majority of women present themselves at our lying-in institution either actually in labour or when the process is just imminent. Yet changes in the presentation of the foetus are by no means uncommon—changes, for example, from the transverse to the cranial. In the position, however, especially from one cranial position to another, changes are not only not uncommon, Imt frequent. Now that external palpation has become more thorough, and is practised as routine by every ol)stetrician, along with the aid afforded by auscultation, these changes can be made out with great accuracy. In the case which I am desirous of bringing under observation, the clianges from one presentation to another, namely, from cranial to face, and vice TcrsCi, were frequent. It is, however, specially with the view of illustrat- ing one probable causation of a certain class of face cases that I offer the following remarks;— Face cases may be either primitive or secondary. Although this classification is not adopted by many authors, yet the arrangement is a convenient one, for it differentiates two sets of face cases occurring under two very different sets of circum- stances. It is necessary, therefore, clearly to define each variety. The ordinary or secondary set of face cases, which are de-

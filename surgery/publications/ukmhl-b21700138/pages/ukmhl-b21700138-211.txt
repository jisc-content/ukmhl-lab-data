OCCIPITO-POSTERIOR POSITIONS OF VERTEX. •95 August 6.—reriiieiim torn down to within lialf an inch of anus. On the right side of the pelvic wall, in the region of the right ischial spine, there is a distinct opening. Its edges are smooth and incurved. It admits readily two fingers, is about 1 in. in length, and its direction, as ascertained by a probe, is downwards and backwards. Through the opeiiing the ischial spine can be felt.

We found head extended, the occiput lying just over the right iliac spine, in front of the oblique diameter. Forceps were applied, and delivery easily effected. There was no attempt to rectify the position, but simple

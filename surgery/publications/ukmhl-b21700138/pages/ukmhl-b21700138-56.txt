40 CLINICAL PAPERS. soullie to which so much importance lias Ijeeii attached was l)reseiit. The pulsating, nii)idly growing extra-uterine tumour was present. Tlie menstrual supjaession and suhse(j[uent lucmorrhages were pre.sent ; and although 1 did not get a record of or find any decidua present, yet the woman’s state- ments with regard to the blood and clots which ]>assed made it more than likely that .some slireds had escai)cd. }lere, then, it seemed to me at last 1 had fallen across a well-marked extra-uterine pregnancy. I accordingly o])ened the al>donien, and came down u])on a lai'ge dark mass lying in the right side of the pelvis. It was soft, and entirely iixed in every direction. All this exactly corres})onded with what one exi)ects in extra-uterine pregnancy. I proceeded to sej)arate the adhesions carefully, and succeeded in freeing the mass after very considerable trouble. T drew it to the surface, aud ju.st as it reached the surface of the al)doniiual wound it ruptured, and a considerable quantity of blood esca])ed over the abdomen. I ligatured the pedicle aud removed it, still believing that I was dealing with an extra-uterine jaegnancy. It was carefully examined at the College of Physicians’ Laljoratory l_)y Dr. Wuudhead and others. No trace of ])regnancy whatever could be found in the sac, and the tunionr was found to he a huge distension of the tube with blood, or, in other words, a lucmatosalpinx. It seems to me tliat the only ])oint in the case which failed to suh.stantiate extra-uterine ])regnancy was the absence of decidua. Eveiy other sym])toni was jaesent. Of course this may have heeu an early extra-uterine ])regnancy in which the ovum lunl been absorbed ; Imt there was no trace either of chorion or decidua. I do not discuss this ])oint; 1 only mean to say that the ordinary ])hysical characteristics of ])regnancy were wanting in the sac.

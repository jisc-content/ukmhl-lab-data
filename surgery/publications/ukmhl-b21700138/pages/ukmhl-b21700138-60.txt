CLINICAL rAPERS. 44 4. Tlie presence of paroxysmal pain localised to one side, though not to one s])ot. All those conditions innst he present, but my cases seem to show that the essential point is passage of the decidua. In the first two cases this did not occur, and that was the weak ]>oint in the diagnosis; in my third case, where the diagnosis was made accurately, tlie ])assage of the decidua and the suhse(|uent rapid growth of tlie lateral tumour placed the nature of the case to my mind lieyond disjmte. Indeed, tliese three cases would seem to show tlie converse of what j\Ir. Tait insists on.

The whole (piestion turns upon the point—whether the case is seen sufficiently early to admit of careful examina- tion of it lieing made at intervals, liefore a definite conclusion is arrived at. I have avoided s]leaking of oiieration; Imt there is this much comfort, that whatever the nature of the tumour may lia])pen to he, so long as the uterus can he carefully excluded, the sooner the tumour is removed the better. Cask 4.—The fourth case was sent to me by ])r. l)oig of (lalashiels, and diagnosed by him as an early extra-uterine jiregnancy. I’lie jiatient was a young married lady. She had missed two jieriods, and had irregular lucmorrhages accomjianied hy jiaroxysmal pain. On the right side she had a soft elastic swelling. The uterus was ]iushed over to the left side, and was soft and enlarged. She passed an

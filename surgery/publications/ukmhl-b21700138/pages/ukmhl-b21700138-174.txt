158 CLINICAL PAPERS. tliat they were both quite well, but tliat they had never menstruated. One was at once struck with the appearance of tlie patients. The features were distinctly of the masculine type ; the elder had a budding moustache, and tlieir figures lacked the rounded contour of the female form. They were dressed in fashionable female costume, and when they spoke the voice was loud and harsh. The years which they had reached fully justified a suspicion of some alDnormality, and therefore I suggested an examination, under chloroform, which was agreed to. On examination, both presented the same peculiarities. The hair of the head was unduly short for girls ; the mamnnv and nii)ples were small and undeveloped, so that the chest wall was flat and entirely masculine. In the case of the elder, the skin over the sternum was slightly iiirsute. On examining the abdomen, one noticed that the pul)is was well covered with hair, and that this extended upwards towards the umbilicus ; but it was on examining the external genitals that the most remarkable features were found. Each had a representative of the penis, about 1 in. long, and at the base of this, on the lower surface, the meatus urinarius was dis- covered. The penis was covered Ijy skin, and on retraction of this a small glans was observed, but there was no evidence of a urethra in the organ. Behind this, which appeared to lie simply a hypertrophied clitoris, there were two apparently somewhat large labia majora; but, on separating these, no vaginal orifice could be found, and on a more thoroimh examination it was made out that each labium contained what was evidently a small testicle. The labia were therefore simply an incomplete scrotum, it having a marked cleft between the two sides, and the raphe being completely liidden unless the “ labia ” were separated. An examination was made per rectum; no trace of a uterus or appendages could be detected, but the prostate gland, fully developed, was easily felt.

145 SENILE UTERINE CATARRH. iiillainmatioii, the uterus may continue large after the meno- pause, and may he the subject of post-climacteric inflammation, though this is always less marked than when menstrual con- gestion regularly recurs to aggravate the condition. Yet undoubtedly there are many cases in which senile catarrh occurs in which tliere is no history of ante-climacteric dis- turbance, and in which the uterus is normally poised, and gives no evidence of surrounding inflammation. 2. Tilt pointed out that very often the cervix slirinks, whereas the body of the uterus is inflamed, and the fluid becomes pent up, giving the colicky uterine pains. IMatthews Duncan had several times to puncture the cervix, so as to allow the escape of inflammatory fluid. The cases Tilt knew best were those of senile inflammation of the cervix and of the vaginaâ€”not so much of the body ; and for these post-climacteric inflammations he strongly recommended caustics. I should like strongly to insist that this condition of senile uterine catarrh is not prodromatic of malignant disease; the two are quite distinct, and I have never seen a case of tlie simple condition later become one of cancer. As regards the treatment adopted, when the condition is non-maliguant or doubtful, I have had the best results from rest, hot douching, and the internal administration of arsenic, strophanthus, and Chian turpentine. To give the last-named drug may seem contradictory, as it was long supposed to have beneficial effects in cases of cancer. This I do not believe, but it is quite certain that it has a good effect on inflammatory conditions; and, it seems to me, has almost an equally good effect in clearing up purely uterine inflammation, as in cervical inflammatory hypertrophy. Nothing gives better results than either the application of escharotics by means of dressed sounds, or, still better, the curettage of the mucous membrane, with subsequent packing and draining.

LESSER GYNAECOLOGICAL MANIPULATIONS. 171 aineiiorrlioea, and such like, for which such instruiiieiits were devised and employed, are in the main not due to uterine conditions at all, but to other patliological conditions, either partly or altogether beyond the uterus itself. This brings us naturally to the discussion of the question of dilatation of the cervix. This operation, whether accom- plished rapidly by the Sims, Ellinger, or Hegar dilator, or graduated bougies, is one which, if carefully carried out, seems to me to give the best results in dysmenorrhoea ; so long, he it clearly understood, as the dysmenorrhoea is purely and entirely uterine in its nature and origin, so long as the appendages are perfectly free and normal, and so long as there is no antenienstrual pain. In such cases the dilatation, of whatever nature, will give satisfactory results. But where there is the least reason to suppose that appendage troul.)le, however slight, exists, or that there is any antenienstrual })ain, then, not only will the dilatation give no good result at all, but the operator will unquestionably run the risk of setting up very serious mischief. I’erhaps the majority of cases of dysmenorrhoea are due to some morbid condition in the ovaries or tubes, or both. At the same time I am not slow to recognise that there are a number of cases that are purely uterine, and where these can be judiciously and accurately diagnosed, as I believe they can, then in them dilatation, carried out with care and with the necessary antiseptic precautions, gives, so far as my experience is concerned, excellent results. Indeed, I know of no other way by which uterine dysmenor- rhcea can, as a rule, be successfully treated, and therefore I recognise that this operation of dilatation is a useful and im- portant one ; but at the same time I am quite alive to the fact that it is both injudiciously and carelessly used, and without a due regard to the precautions to which I have just referred. In such cases nothing but disaster accompanies its use—disasters sucii as perimetritis, ovaritis, etc.; and it was quite recently that I was called upon to remove a large blood

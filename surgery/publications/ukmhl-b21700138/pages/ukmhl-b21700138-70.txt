CLINICAL PAPERS. 54 continued every six iiours, and everything seemed satisfactory, except the rapid condition of the pulse. On tlie 29th, at 7.30 r.M., the pulse, whicli had been fairly constant at 120, became irregular and intermittent. In spite of stimulants, the condition did not improve as the evening went on, and the patient died somewhat suddenly at 11.30. Post-mortem.â€”Considerable lioemorrliage was found beneath tlie lower sac, in the pouch of Douglas, and an ante-mortem clot, several days old, was found in the right lieart. This case presents no features of special interest. It is a very characteristic case of an extra-uterine tubal preguanc}^ rupturing about the twelftli week, between the layers of the broad ligament. There were four distinct indications at different periods of lueniorrhage and extended rupture. In comparing the two cases, however, witli regard to causation, it is very interesting to notice tliat tlie first occurred in a young woman of 27. She was a primipara, who had absolutely no indication of pelvic disturbance liefore her pregnancy, and the latter case had a history of two yearsâ€™ constant pain and premenstrual distress, so that to whatever extent desipiamative salpingitis, or some such lesion, may account for the latter, it is extremely difficult to offer any explanation of the former. As regards the mortality, it was just. the converse of what 1 should have expected. Tn the first case the abdominal cavity was opened into before I reached the sac, and the patient remained collapsed for more than thirty hours; while, in the second, the o])eration was entirely extraperitoneal, and the ])atient did well for two days, and then died some- what suddenly, and evidently from the effusion of Idood into the poucli of Douglas. 1 shall always regret that 1 did not leave the iodoform gauze in longer, because 1 believe the continuous ]>ressure might have i)revented the luemorrhage and saved the jiatient.

BLADDER DURING EARLY PUERPERIUM. 133 We now come to look at the (quantity of urine re(|nired t(j produce these three definite alterations in the post-])artum uterus, namely—(1) displacement upwards and hackwai’ds ; (2) displacement laterally; (2) rotation. I haye found that from 20 to 30 oz. of urine are sufficient to bring about the upward and lateral dis})lacenients of the uterus. From 8 to 15, 1 haye found, make Imt yery little a})]irecialjle <litference. rfaunkuch says that 100 c.c. of urine—i.e. 3‘5 oz. —raise the uterus, on an ayerage, alimit 1 cm., that is, a ill- Autefage says that with a bladder full, of from 400 to GOO grins, of urine, nothing is more common, the day after accouchement, than to obserye an augmentation of the real height of the uterus, which is not less than from 4 to 9 cms.. If to 3 in. Once he found 3 to 9 cms., usually 5 cms.. If in. Now, on comparing these figures with each other, the results will be found to lie yery different, and the explanation will lie found in the fact that the obseryations were made in different perioils of tbe puerperium. I haye already shown that this is important, because the displacing infliience of the bladder on the uterus proportionally diminishes as the puerperium adyances, and I need not again here refer to the reason for this. In the present communication I refer to the early puei'iierium, and here 1 mean to state that an amount of urine yarying from 20 to 30 oz. is necessary to bring aliout the position changes in the uterus to which I haye referred ; that, further, the relatiye amount of position change is more marked with 25 oz. than with the largest quantities; or, in other words, that the displacement of the uterus does not, after a certain point has been reached, bear a direct jiroportion to the repletion of the bladder. For example, the displace- ni^nt changes—upwards, laterally, and transyersely—while distinctly marked with 25 oz., will not be proportionatebj increased with 50 oz.

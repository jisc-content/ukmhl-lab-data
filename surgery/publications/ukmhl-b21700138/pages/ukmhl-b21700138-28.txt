On Some Peculiar Jielatioiis of Abdominal and lAlvic Tumours. 'J'he object of tlie present coniimniicatiou is to place on record some cases of al)doininal tumours wliicb have had exce})tional and peculiar relations. That it is often the unexpected which occurs is e(pially true in alidominal surgeiy, as it is in daily life, and perhaps in no department of surgery do unlikely complications occur more fre(piently than in that to which I now refer. I have no intention of discussiuu: difficulties and mis- takes in diagnosis, botli of which are grave and fre(pient, but ratlier to refer to a series of cases of ovarian, fibroid, and other tumours which ■])re.sented jieculiar and interesting relations. Case 1.— First of all, with regard to ovarian tumours, the acconi])anying diagram (Fig. 2) will sufficiently sliow a very unusual position and relation of an ovarian cyst. It indicates a distinct dull area above tlie umbilicus, while be- tween tliat ])oint and the ])ul)es the resonance is clear and tym])aidtic. The tumour was fixed, si)lierical, and cystic, and its nature was a matter of extreme doul)t.

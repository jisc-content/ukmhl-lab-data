While admitting tliat ta])])ing of a simjile cyst may sometimes he of advantage, it is siqjerlluous to remark that such a ])roceeding in cysts, which are possessed of ])apilloniatous characters, can l.)e only ultimately detrimental. 111. Othek ]5i;oad Ligament Cysts. Ly these are intended those numerous sini})le cysts of the hroad ligament, often of large sixe, which cannot be sIiomti to have any ovarian or parovarian oi-igin, and wliicli were formerly included under the general term, “ parovarian ” cyst. “ Far away,” writes Doran, “ from tlie parovarian tubes, some minute cysts are often observed, adherent, as a rule, to the anterior layer of the l)road ligament. ... As a rule these cysts, when they increase in size, push apart tlie layers of the broad ligament. I have invariably found that their inner layer is endothelial. It is often from a minute cvst of this kind, free from the parovarian tubes, that is developed the large cyst commonly called “ jiarovailan,” witli its thin, transparent wall, its single cavity, lined with liat or low columnar epithelium, and its clear, watery content.s.” These simple cysts, althougli not pediculated in tlie sense ill which a multilocular ovarian is, yet nevertheless are com- monly provided with an attacliment free enough to permit of easy removal. Not iiifrecpiently, however, they burrow down- wards beyond the broad ligament, and take on a sessile nature, becoming embedded among the pelvic structures. The latter condition is the one we are now speciallv concerned with, wlien the tumour, jiassing from the broad ligament, reaches the retroperitoneal s]>ace, tlie mesentery of the colon, or the pouch of Douglas.

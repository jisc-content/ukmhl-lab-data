CLINICAL PAFEKS. i6 One caiiiKjt but tliiiik that the only possible explanation is, that the small pedicle had l)een unconsciously tom during removal; if that were so, no trace of it could l)e found, and tiiere was no luemorrliage. h'ASE d ])resented some remarkable features. Tlie patient, a married woman, was sent to me as sul'lering from acute peri- tonitis.

CLINICAL PAPERS. 2o6 [ heard nothing of her again for seven montiis, when I was asked by her medical attendant to see lier, as she was in labour, and he conld find no os. We found a tumour, evidently the pregnant uterus, reacliing as far up as the innbilicus, and a round, hrm, solid mass occupying the vagina. Under an amesthetic I could just feel the posterior lip of the cervix. It was quite hard and fixed. I waited some little time, but the cervix, which was hard and indurated, showed no symptoms of dilating, and her previous abscess in the pelvis and sul)se(|uent adhesions did not warrant one in using any great effort to pull the cervix into position. There was, therefore, no alternative but to open tlie abdomen and extract the f(jetus. This offered ng difficulty except one, namely, that 1 had some trouble in pulling the head, whicli was large and somewhat hydrocephalic, out of the cavity of the ])elvis. The child was dead, and the mother recovered from the operation ; but later on, about the second week, she developed peritonitis, probably septic in origin, and died of pneumonia. Dr. Eeid of Glasgow communicated a somewhat similar case to the Edinljurgh Obstetrical Society, which he designated as “ labour obstructed from an unusual cause.” In his case the placenta occupied the lower uterine segment, and tlie cause of the displacement he attributed to adhesions consequent upon an old pelvic inflammation. Case :3.—A third case was sent to me by Dr. MTvercher, which serves to illustrate still furtlier the method by which this anomaly is produced. A multipara, tet. 54, supposed to l)e suffering from an ovarian tumour, was sent liere for operation. I found a tumour somewhat irregular in shape, occupying the abdomen and reaching as far up as the umbilicus. The vagina was likewise filled by a large rounded tumour. Xo cervix uteri could be anywhere detected, and as there was no auscultatory sound to be heard except a very faint souffle, as

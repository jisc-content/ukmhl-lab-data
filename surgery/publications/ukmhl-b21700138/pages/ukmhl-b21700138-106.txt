90 CLINICAL PAPERS. Lastly, with regard to tliose cases in which a leucorrhoeal discharge is described as occurring with the mittelschmerz, and where, just before the usual date of the occurrence of the pain, a swollen and liuctuating condition of the tubes was in some cases made out, I think there can he no (piestion tliat the cause of the intermenstrual pain was to he found in hydrops Fallopii, reaching its full development at mid-term. I am well aw'are that much douljt is now tlirown upon the possibility of the existence of what is called “ intermitting hydrosalpinx,” or “ hydrops tiibte proiluens,” the occasional sudden escai)c of Ihiid tlirough a temporarily patent uterine end, with disap])earance and diminution in size of the tubal dilatation. According to some, it is iniicli more likely that these discharges pass, not through the cervix, Init l)y a vaginal fistula communicating with the cyst. Either ex]»lanation is compatible with this view of mine. In my case, in wliicli a removal of the tul)es and ovaries In’ought about a cessation of tlie mittelsclnnerz, it may l>e urged that the pain had been ovarian, and that the removal of the liydrops did not lead to its cessation, Imt the removal of the ovary. Here 1 would remark that colicky ]»ain in the tubes in such a condition occurs, coiitractions of the sac forcing the fluid througli a uterine orifice only partially closed ; and also tliat pain may be due to discharge of uterine contents, the result of rellex contraction of a necessarilv coiiLrested t. O uterus. Thus it is more than likely tliat tlie pain was really till )al.

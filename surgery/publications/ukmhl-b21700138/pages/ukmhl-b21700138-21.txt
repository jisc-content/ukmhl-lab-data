5 PREMATURE SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT. - “Traite de gynecologic.” ^ Med.-Chir. Trans., Loudon, 181-3. instances of this have been noted, but that described by 'William Cook ^ is distinctive enough. “Louisa Flux was born in 1802. Up till her fourth year slie was remarkably thin, but apart from this there was no abnormal feature. The external pudenda now became pro- minent and covered with a (piantity of dark hair. 'Witliin four months of her death, which occurred on October 1, 1800, she began to suffer from convulsions, after which she increased enormously in weight, and her complexion Ijecame ilorid. Her cheeks were downy, and her lip was covered with so much hair that it might he said she had a 1)eard. Her voice, formerly shrill, now became strong, and her whole contour was that of puberty, except the l»reasts and the general stature. The post-mortem appearance ; Ho change had taken place in the internal organs of generation, the ovaries and uterus not having received that increase of size which is usual at puberty. The mons veneris and labia pudendi were as prominent as at perfect puberty, and covered with long; black coatiim hairs. Menstruation had not taken place.” 3. Menstruation occurring without any change in the genitals is not so unusual as tlie preceding, but even thus it is rare for a child to hav^e the catamenia established for a period of years without other phenomena presenting themselves. Fozzi cites - Bernard’s case, reported in the I^yon mid., 1887, of a girl who menstruated regularly from birth up to the age of 1 2 years without any development of her external genital organs. In the same class may be included those cases noted by the following authors:— Allbutt’s ^ case, wliere menstrual discharge occurred period- ically until tlie youthful patient died of exhaustion.

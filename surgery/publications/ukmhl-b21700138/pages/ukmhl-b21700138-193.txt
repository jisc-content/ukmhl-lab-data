177 ETIOLOGY OF VAGINAL HEMATOMA. Case 1 occurred in the bauds of one of niy dispensary pupils—Mrs. M., a multipara, in labour with her sixth child. When I saw her the membranes had ruptured for twelve hours, and the head had made no progress, though the pains had been strong.

She suffered much pain during the niglit, with strong expulsive efforts ; and when she was seen in the morning, a rupture had taken place at the lower end of the vagina, through which had escaped free venous blood and clots.

As the patient had been in labour for ten hours, as the membranes had been ruptured for six, and as no progress was made, I was called to see the case and deliver with forceps. I found the pains very violent and strong; the head

ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC TUMOURS. 21 would account for some of the second class of subperitoneal fibroids, namely— 2. Those which are fouud free iu the abdominal cavity. Although these are referred to in most text-books, I have had considerable difficulty in finding reference to actual cases. I have not met with any in my own experience. Turner ^ refers to a case in which a calcareous fibroid was found free in the pouch of Douglas, and Depaul ^ found a fibroma entirely free in the same situation without any adhesions whatever. I have already referred to the post-mortem cases mentioned by Sir James Simpson. 3. As to the third variety, they occur apparently much more frequently; that is to say, cases which have either l)ecome spontaneously detached, and formed adhesions with other viscera, or, while still remaining attached to the uterus, have become adherent to other structures. It is one of the characteristics of fibroids that they are, unlike ovarians, quite free, and do not readily form adhesions with surrounding structures. And yet a few well-authenticated cases are recorded, in which a pediculated subperitoneal fibroid has severed its connection with the uterus, and formed adhesions with other parts, and thereby derived its nourishment. Thus Homans ^ reports a uterine fibroid, which had 1)een completely separated from the uterus, and had caused death 1)V intestinal obstruction, it havimj formed adhesions with the intestines, and was nourished apparently from the omen- tum. The tumour weighed 2^ lb., and on this one case Homans insists strongly on the removal of all subperitoneal filu’oids to prevent a similar accident, which, considering the frequency of pediculatetl suliperitoneal fibroids, and the rarity of intestinal obstruction from tins cause, seems a somewhat ’ Edin.

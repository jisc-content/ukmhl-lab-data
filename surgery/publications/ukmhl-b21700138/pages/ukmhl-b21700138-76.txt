CLINICAL PAPERS. 6o 2. Tlie paroophoron, producing papillary cysts; and 3. The parovarian—the source of the parovarian cysts. In addition to these origins of tninonr growth, Tait considers that the horizontal or Giirtner’s tnbes, which can occasionally ])e traced down the uterus and along the vaginal walls, are occasionally occluded at intervals, and to the remnants which remain patent there is tlie possibility of degenerating into large cystic formations. I. rAPILLAllY CvSTO.MA OR rAROOFlIORlTIC Cv.ST. Origin. — Olshausen, in 1877, suggested that these growths arose from the parovarium, because of the cylin- drical epithelium and the iutra-ligamentary situation. Since then, however, as the result of numerous clinical observations, he has l.)een led to the conclusion that papillary cystomata must spring from the ovary itself. The paroophoron, or that part of the ovary which, in the adult, constitutes the hilum, is composed of filirous tissue, interspersed with Idood vessels, and into it run the vertical tubules of the parovarium. It is derived from the foetal mesonephros, which has become degenerated ; hence is origin- ally tuljular in cliaracter, which feature may persist after birth. Anatomical characters and relations.—Originating; in the ovary, these cysts pass l)etween the layers of the mesosalpinx, to gain the broad ligament pro})cr, between the two layers of which they burrow until they may even pass beyond this structure. AVliilst still small they do not aHect the appear- ance of the true ovary, as an ovarian tumour does, though ultimately the ovary may become incor])orated and lost in the wall of the tumour. At no time do they ever reach the huge dimensions attainable by a multilocular ovarian ; nevertheless they may, as in Case 304, pass superiorly beyond the um- bilicus, and inferiorly deep into the pelvis, so as to be felt imniediatelv on introducing the finger into the vagina.

BLADDER D URING EARLY PUERL^ERLUM. 131 2 0 oz. of urine drawn oft'; vesical tumour disappeared; uterus sank 2 in. below umbilicus and l)ecame mesial. Case 2.—Ovoid vesical tumour, 1 in. above umbilicus; main portion to right; nterus to left; 20 oz. of urine drawn off; uterus mesial. Case 3.—Distinct bladder tumour extending to right side, Id in. above the level of umbilicus; uterus to left and back; 2 8 oz. of urine drawn off; uterus mesial. Case 4.—Distinct vesical tumour, 1^- in. above umbilicus; lies to right of mesial line; uterus to left; 32 oz. of urine drawn oft'; uterus central. Obs. 2, Case 4.—Vesical tumour extending 1 in. above umbilicus ; main portion to right; uterus to left; 2 5 oz. urine <lrawn oft’; uterus central. It seems to me, then, that normally tlie uterus in the early puerperium, under the conditions mentioned—namely, an empty bladder and rectum and the horizxnital position—is central; that when the bladder is full the uterus is deflected either to the right or left side. If to the right side, the deflection is due—(1) to a previous existing right lateral deviation during pregnancy; (2) to the presence of a loaded rectum; (3) to the accident of position. If to the left side, it is mainly due—(1) to the filling of the bladder, which, for the reasons mentioned, expands to the right; or (2) to the left lateral decubitus of the patient. It is to be further observed that these displacements are more common in early puerperium than in late— 1. Because more urine is secreted in early than late puerperium, and therefore the l^ladder gets more rapidly distended. Gassner has shown that increased diuresis is the normal condition during the puerperium, and both this author and Winckel distinctly show that the increase is most marked in the first days after delivery.

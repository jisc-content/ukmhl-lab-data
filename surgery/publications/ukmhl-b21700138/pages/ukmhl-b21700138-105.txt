MITTELSCHMERZ. 89 cervix with pinhole os, antehexion of the uterus, and retraction of the utero-sacral ligament. From the above notes, vliicli, so far as I can discover, include a mention of nearly every case of mittelschmerz which has been recorded, the condition, it seems to me, can be well considered as havino- tliree dilferent manifestationsâ€” O 1. A group of cases in which there is no external mani- festation at all. 2. Those cases where the pain is associated with an esca})e of blood. 3. Tliose in wliicli the intermenstrual pain is associated with a clear discharge. It would be absurd to dogmatise upon the causes which give rise to this condition, or to lay down any hard-and-fast rules as to the pathological conditions necessary to its pro- duction, hut it seems to me tliat the above classification gives a fair in.sight into the different states that may lead to the production of this somewhat nnnsnal symptom. 1. With resrard to those cases where no external iiiaui- O festation accompanies the occurrence of mittelscimierz, the explanation is probably to be found in the fact that ovulation and menstruation do not in tliese cases occur simultaneously ; that, in addition, owing to thickening of the capsule of the ovary, or some such cause, dehiscence of tlie follicle occurs with pain. 2. Those associated with escape of blood. In all of these it will be observed that tliere was present more or less endometritis, anteflexion, and enlargement of the uterus, and, so far as 1 am able to judge, tliese were simply cases in which a slight intermenstrual flow, due to endometritis, was accompanied by a well-marked pain during the passage of clots. Such a condition is well recognised and common, and scarcely, I think, should come under the category of niittel- schnierz at all. Still, it adequately enough describes a set of cases to which the (Germans especially have drawn attention.

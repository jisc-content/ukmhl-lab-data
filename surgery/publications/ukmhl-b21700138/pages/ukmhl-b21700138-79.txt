63 SESSILE CYSTS. parovarium, or Wolffian relics, can l)e truly designated “ parovarian.” In the adult the remains of the Wolffian body are represented l)y Kohelt’s tubules; the horizontal and the vertical tubes, permanent and occluded, of the parovarium ; and the remains of (uirtner’s duct. The cysts which arise from the vertical tubes of the parovarium are similar in pathological appearance to those tumours already described as arising from tlie hiluni of the ovary. At first, while diminutive, they can be recognised by their position, as occupying tlie site of the true parovarium, or, if they arise from the obliterated portion, then appealing between the straigiit tubes and the uterus; but when the cyst has increased in size, and has parted asunder the layers of tlie broad ligament, and tlie ovary lias become altered in configuration, it may be only matter of conjecture whetlier it be of parovarian or paroophoritic origin. Their appearance is similar in all respects to those previously described. Their wall is lined by cubical epithelium, whicli in the early stages may be ciliated or cylindrical; usually they contain clear fluid, tend to the pro- duction of papillomatous masses growing from the sac wall, and bear a similar character of frequent malignant metastasis. They spread deeply in the broad ligament, and are often a great source of trouble when the surgeon undertakes their removal. From the terminal cyst of the parovarium, and from the horizontal tube, is developed quite a distinct variety of tumour, corresponding in its pathology more closely to the simple cyst of the lu’oad ligament. It is lined l)y a sinqde layer of flattened epithelial cells or endothelium, and in its other manifestations simulates the appearance described as pertaining to those simple broad ligament cysts, although being of true parovarian origin. These cysts may enlarge without being pediculated, may

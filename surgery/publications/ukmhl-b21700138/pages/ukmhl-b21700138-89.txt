(ilycosuria is by no means a common complication of ovarian or other large aljdominal tumours, Imt, taking into consideration the absence of the usual diabetic symptoms, it seemed more probable that it was caused by, and not merely coincident with, the growth of tlie tumour. From November 27 to December G, 2 grs. of codeia were administered to the patient every six hours, the diet being modified within reasonalile limits. This, liowever, produced but little elfect on the amount of sugar passed daily, the lowest record being 340 grs. (10 grs. to the oz.), and the drug began to cause sickness. IMorphia was then tried, with no better result so far as tbe sugar was concerned. As the growth of the tumour was distinctly progressing, and the dyspnoea liecoming urgent, o])eration was decided u])on. Laparotomy was performed on December 12. The alxlominal walls were (piite 4 in. thick. On opening into the peritoneal cavity, a large colloid tumour was found impli- cating each ovary. No difficulty was experienced in removing these and in completing the operation. Tlie two tumours weighed oGl If). A ([uick reaction followed, and for the first six days the pulse never fell below 100, the tem- ])erature remaining about 100Â° F. for tbe first four days. After this she made a good though slow recovery, and left the hospital ou January 2G, 1805. To return to the (piestion of the glycosuria, it was noticed that, whereas a specimen of urine examined on the morning of the operation contained 12 gr.s. of sugar per oz., a specimen

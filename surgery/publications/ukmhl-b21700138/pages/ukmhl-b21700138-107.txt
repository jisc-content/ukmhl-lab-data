Vaginal Hysterectomy. The therapeutics wliich thirty years ago held tlieir SNvay over this department no longer occupy the all-important place they once did ; and diseases of women have drifted away absolutely and entirely from the domain of the physician into that of the surgeon pure and simple. Xo doubt this is to some extent natural. The develop- ment of abdominal surgery wdthin the last thirty years has been so startling and phenomenal, that no wonder men have devoted their lives and their time to the perfection of this particular branch. The operation of ovariotomy is itself a striking example, and there can be no doubt whatever that, with the present generation, the role of the ovariotomist pure and simple exists no longer. Xow, that operation, which is as safe as any other major operation in surgery, has, thaidcs to the obstetrician first and to the gymecologist after him, become an operation as much in the province of an ordinary surgeon as a hernia or a gastrostomy. But it must be kept in mind that this advance is due entirely to our department. It must ever be, however, and will ever continue to be, a ditiicultv with the surgeon who is not accustomed to either obstetrical or gyniecological work, to make his diagnosis a certainty, and therein will always lie tlie crux with the surgeon when he takes pelvi-abdominal work in hand. This question of diagnosis brings ns at once back to the domain of the obstetrician, with whom the diagnosis of pregnancy, for example, is part of his daily work, whereas the general surgeon has not the opportunity of perfecting himself in the differentiation of such conditions.

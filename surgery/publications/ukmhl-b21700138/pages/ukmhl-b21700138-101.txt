85 MITTELSCHMERZ. menstrual paiu only for live years. It will therefore be seen that this case differed entirely from the last one, in which the condition of intermenstriial j)ain had existed from childhood. Two things, consequently, are clear al)Out this case—first, that the condition was distinctly an ac(|uired one.

Secondly, if it were due to })ainful ovulation, occurring independently of menstrua- tion, then it would have been expected that the intermenstriial pain would not have lieeii of siicli recent origin.

This question of hydrops tubie profiuens I shall discuss later on. Case 3.—A woman, let. 25, was brought to St. Luke’s Home some years ago suttering from severe dysmenorrlioea, the dysmenorrhoea occurring for the first three days of tlie menstrual period. Various remedies were prescribed, but slie returned to the Home some months afterwards, beinq no better.

I examined her tlien, and found the condition in the

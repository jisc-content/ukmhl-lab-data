FIBROID TUMOURS DURING PREGNANCY. 123 the rule, that when the tumour is easily accessible, and can be removed without a severe operation in the first few days of the puerperium, such artificial removal ought to be had recourse to, in order to prevent the possibility of gangrene and septic absorption. Care must be taken that the whole tumour be removed, in case of the base sloughing and giving rise to septicemia, as in my first case. If there be any doubt as to the possibility of its entire removal, it had better be left alone and allow nature to expel it spontaneously. If, however, tlie removal involves a severe operation, it would obviously be prudent not to interfere. Of course, in those cases where the tumour gives rise to septiciemia late in the puerperium, its immediate removal is matter of necessity. In all cases of removal of these growths in the puerperium, too much stress cannot be laid on the extreme importance of washing out the cavity of the uterus with corrosive daily, until every trace of foetor has disappeared. In both my cases pieces of slough and very foetid discharge continued for many days after the removal; and, in spite of careful washing out, one ultimately succumbed.

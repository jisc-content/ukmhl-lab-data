CLINICAL l^AL^EKS. lO lier iai»e. In the same connectiuii it is well to observe the mother’s statement, that the mainline were enlarged to such an extent at birth that the development of mammary abscesses was feared. J'his goes far to show that the child had a tendency to jtrecocity in development, which only re(piired the stimulus of the rejieated sexual acts to mature the activity both of the uterus and ovaries. Her mental develoi>- ment was rather under average. The o]»eration was undertaken on the llbtli November. On cutting through the alidominal parietes, the bluish surface of tlie tumour at once indicated its true character. There was some degree of ascites. ’J'lie tumour was as})irated, but only a small (piantity of sero-sanguinolent fluid was with- drawn. There were no adhesions, and the tumour was yierfectly free in every direction. The abdominal incision had to be enlarged up to within in. of the ensiform cartilage, owing to the fact of the tumour being absolutely incompressilile. It was removed through the abdominal wound, and found to be attached to the left side of the ])elvis by a long yiedicle, which was secured in the ordinary way. The Fallo])ian tube was greatly ilistended and tm-tuous. 'I’lie ovary on the 0])]>osite side was (piite small and un- developed. The tulie on the same side was hvy)ertro])hied. 'riie uterus was enlarged, corres])onding to the dimensions indicated l»y the sound ])rovions to oy)cration. The al>dominal wound was closed, and the child made an uninterrujtted recovery. The chart showed the usual temperature curve in ovariotomy ]»erformed on children. The tumour weighed over 6 lb. Its surface was smooth and soft, and its walls were very vascular, lu its substance were a number of cysts sc])ara.ted by loose septa, which were very fragile. 1 he cystic contents were grumous or oelatimms and trans])arcnt lluiil. The micro.sco]tic a])y)earances were those of a ra])idly growing round-celled sarcoma with mucoid degeneration in ]iarts.

PELVI-ABDOMINAL OPERATIONS. 149 ago, and shortly after marriage she Ijecame pregnant, and was delivered at full time; but during the whole period of her pregnancy she had exhibited symptoms similar to those she showed during menstruation, but shortly after delivery she became perfectly well, and has remained well since, though menstruating regularly. It is unnecessary here to refer to mental conditions during normal pregnancy; they are very well known and recognised, and one would pass from these, which might well be called “ normal neuroses,” to those which are associated with pelvic or abdominal operations. The following case is interestino;, inasmuch as one cannot imagine any class of case that is so disappointing to an operator as this, in which the whole advantage and benefit of the operation is destroyed and misunderstood, on account of this mental distress :— Case 2.—A young woman, a widow, set. 32, was admitted into a nursing-home—under my charge—suffering from villous endometritis, with profuse hsemorrhage, not only at her menstrual periods, but intermenstrually as well. On examination, the uterus was found much enlaro;ed and easilv hiemorrhagic. The obvious treatment was to perform curet- tage. This was accordingly done, and the patient made an excellent recovery. Some weeks afterwards she took an inordinate dislike to her own child, threatened to murder it, and she is now an inmate of an asylum. Here again is a distinctly disappointing result. In this case the diagnosis was obvious, and the cure absolutely com- jfiete, and yet the case ended more disastrously than if the patient had died of acute sepsis. Such a case impresses one with the importance of regarding, in their estimate of the danger of an operation, the fact that it may be followed by mental changes as serious as the one just re- ferred to.

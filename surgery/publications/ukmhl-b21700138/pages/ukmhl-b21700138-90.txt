During the first eleven days after the operation no special treatment was adopted, the daily quantity of sugar secreted averaging al)out 370 grs., and on one day (December 18) being as high as 700 grs., the amount per oz. on that occasion being 25 grs. On December 23, mor])liia was resumed, the liq. moiq)h. hydrochlor. being used in 15-minim doses every four hours, tlie diet Ijeing modified to a slight extent. This was followed by an appreciable diminution in the daily secretion of sugar. On December 26, and subsetpiently, experiments were made on urine passed immediately l)efore food and tliat passed some time after. It was found tliat the latter con- tained nearly twice as much sugar as tlie former. From tlie same date, the urine passed during the day and that passed during the night were kept separate. It was thus observed that from 60 to 80 per cent, of the sugar was passed during the dav. t/ On January 2 the morphia was stopped and tlie diet more rigidly restricted to nitrogenous articles. This was followed by no very marked changes for tlie first fortnight. Then the sugar diminished rapidly. On January 10 only 45 grs. were passed in the twenty- four hours. During the several days previous to her dismissal on January 26, only slight traces of sugar were to be dis- covered in the day urine, the night secretion being ipiite free. She resumed her ordinary diet on going home, and has kept (juite well ever since. She forwarded a specimen of urine on IMarch 28, which on examination was found to lie absolutely free from any trace of sugar. Several points of interest present themselves in the study of this case, both with regard to the causation of the glyco-

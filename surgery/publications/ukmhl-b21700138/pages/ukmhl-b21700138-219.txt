On the Causation of the Sacculated Preoiiant Uterus. O A sacculated pregnant uterus, occurring in the later nionths of gestation, is by no means a fre(pient occurrence, and the difficulties associated with the diagnosis are so great that I have tliouglit it well to describe four cases which 1 liave met witli lately. The condition lias been described under various names, e.g. retroversion of gravid uterus at term, sacciform uterus, and sacculated uterus. Merriman ^ says “ that lie has liad opportunities of being acquainted with two cases of that ])eculiar and unusual i)osition of the uterus, in wliich tlie os uteri is projected so liigh above the symphysis puljis as to be beyond the reacli of the finger, and the L)ody of the uterus so completely fills up the back part of the pelvis that the sacrum cannot be touched.” In one case the situation of the patient at the first seemed inexplicable, and she continued several days in laljour; but the gradual efforts of nature at length completed lier delivery by restoring the womb to nearly its natural situation. Slie recovered, Init the child was dead-l)orn. A second case recorded Ijy IMerriman was as follows:— “ Tains and discharge of liquor amnii. I’er vaginam, whole of back part of pelvis filled up l)y a globular tumour and no os uteri felt. I’er rectum, tumour made out to l.te uterine. I’atient continued with pains, and on the following day the tumour descended and })atient laid cimvulsions. On 18th and 19th no change.

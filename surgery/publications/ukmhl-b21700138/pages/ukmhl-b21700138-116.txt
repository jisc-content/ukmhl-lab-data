CLIXICAL PAPERS. lOO reiiuiius, that many cases have been recorded in vhich a cure has been obtained by oophorectomy. In our groping for light as to a malady which is in itself absolutely fatal, and which, I fear, according to recent statistics, is increasing, it is our duty to keep an open ndud for any theory, and to welcome any suo-crestiou, however extreme, in dealing with this awful disease. While at the present day every surgical i)roceeding is accepted and adopted, it is striking to think how medical innovations are received with distrust. Even aucTsthesia, that has revolutionised the whole of medicine and surgery, was on its first introduction scorned, and regarded in the light of charlatanism.

CA USA TIOAT OF FFIMITIVE FA CE CASES. 191 in question, as the illustration shows, it was one of extension. This was clearly not the consequence of labour, because the result of labour was to convert the face into a right occipito- posterior, and so bring about flexion. Neither was tlie exten- sion the result of any influence after labour; nor was it, as I have endeavoured to show, the result of any contractions or deflection of the uterus before labour; therefore, the produc- tion of this primary face case depended on some cause intrinsic to the foetus itself. That cause was a tonic contraction of tlie muscles of the back of the neck, with an atonic condition of the depressor muscles of the chin. The frequent change from face to occipito-posterior, and vice versd, were owing entirely to foetal movements, the head lieing more flexed during peiiods of quiescence, and extended when the foetus was in motion It is more than probaljle that the bulk of primary face cases depend on some abnormality such as the one just described.

27 A GROUP OF ABDOMINAL SECTIONS. are dermoid, aud which are nourished, even after strangulation of the pedicle, by their vascular adhesions. These three cases illustrate the condition ^'ery fairly. In all of them the adhesions were extensive, and to these, along with the peritonitis, the danger of the case is mainly due. The contents in each case were clotted aud dark fluid lilood. I did not meet with any one containing pus, nor did 1 meet with a dermoid tumour, which Thornton says is so frequent under such circumstances. The diagnoses were not difficult; the presence of the tumour and the sudden aud acute pain over the region of it, with more or less collapse, were sufficiently indicative of the condition. Of course, acute peritonitis very often masks the condition, but a careful examination into the history and local conditions will, in most cases, make the diagnosis clear. It seems very difficult to account for the accident. Tait attributes its occurrence to the passage of ficces down the rectimi. This may be the case in many, hut olivionsly cannot be in all, because the twist is by no means always in the same direction, namely, from left to right, Init frequently from right to left. Thornton suggests that in the cases in wliicli he met with it the patients were multiparous aud young, aud in active menstrual life, and the twist was the result of some sudden accident or strain. He also refers to tapping the cyst, and leaving it as a possible cause of twisting, and I can readily understand how this takes place, though I have not met witli cases of the kind. Alban Doran explains it by the presence of the costal cartilages aljove, aud the pelvic structures lielow, the tnmonr moving freely, laterally, and anteriorly. In two of my cases tlie accident seemed to occur after the tumour liad just emerged from tlie pelvis. Being freeil from the restraint of the pelvic walls, the cyst enlarges rapidly, aud, being movable in the al)domen, the pedicle

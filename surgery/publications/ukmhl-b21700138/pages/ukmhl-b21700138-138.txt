122 CLINICAL PAPERS. about the size of a Tangerine orange, and of the usual struc- ture. The discliarge for many days was very otfensive. The uterus was washed out daily with warm corrosive, and the lady made an excellent recovery. The two cases which I have just recorded present characteristic examples of a rare complication of the puer- perium. Judging by the history of the cases recorded, many of these l)oly])i were extruded spontaneously. The presence of such growths during tlie puerjjerium is not without grave danger. Sometimes they soften, break down, and decompose, and are the cause of ])eritonitis, and become the seat of gan- grenous degeneration. This is cliielly the case in the sub- mucous fibroid projecting into the cavity of the puerperal uterus, similar to those wliicli I have just recorded. Similar cases are related by Senderling,^ Yeld,“ Kiwisch,^ AVynn Williams,^ and Duncan.^ Wynn Williams relates a case where a large submucous fibroid, wliich obstructed labour, was enucleated and removed in ids ellbrts to break up the child. Weber ° relates a case in wliich turning had been had recourse to, and where a tumour as large as a man’s fist was removed with the placenta. Grouping together the cases which have hitherto been described, and adding my own two cases, it is convenient to arrange them tlms :— 1. Xon-gangrenous, in Avhich a healthy tumour was expelled Avithout any artificial aid . . .5 2. Gangrenous........ 6 3. Gangrenous, or non-gangrenous, removed artificially Avith liand or instrument . . . .10 These constitute, so far as I knoAA', the cases recorded, making a total of . . . . . .21 As the practical deduction from these Ave may formulate ^ GusseroAv, loc. cH. - Loc. cit. ^ Prag.

Compliciitcd Case of Double Ovariotomy in a Girl mt. Eio;liteen. (J. S., let. 18, was first admitted to Ward 28 in the Hospital, July 1897, complaining of a swelling of tlie abdomen, which had been mJiced for sixteen months. The patient had never menstruated, but stated tliat at the age of 15 she had some swelling of the abdomen, whicli, liowever, gradually disappeared. Before admission tlie aljdonien was tapped three times, on May 1, June 10, and July 15. She had never complained of pain till a few days before she came into hospital. On admission the patient was very aiuemic, and her face, neck, and chest were much emaciated, the abdomen was enormously distended, and her lower extremities were very oedematous. Examination of the chest revealed the fact that the right pleural cavity was full of fluid, and the apex of the heart was found in the left axilla. The surface of the abdomen showed the presence of numerous distended veins and many recent striie, while the umbilicus markedly protruded. The note on ])ercussion was absolutely dull in every part, while lluctuation was easily determined. The girth of the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus was 40 in. A few days after admission the right pleura was tapped, and 144 oz. of blood-stained serum were removed, and a few days later still, 280 oz. of pinkisb-coloured fluid were aspirated from the abdomen. Thereafter, on examination, the presence of a large tumour, occupying chiefly the left and lower parts of tlie abdominal cavity, was made out. It was very hard.

CAS£S OF EXTRA-UTERINE GESTATION 51 it had distended the tube, the rupture was small, and the symptoms to which it gave rise were practically nil. In brief, I wish to point out that in a case such as this, the failure to find a foetus is in no way inconsistent with what occasionally happens in intra-uterine pregnancy. The chorionic villi had been abnormally developed, not to the extent as occurs in the typical myxoma, where the whole cavity is tilled up by the well-known vesicles, but the nutri- tion of the foetus had been so impaired by the abnormal development of the villi, and the degeneration of the placenta generally, that the foetus had perished and been absorbed. The other case to which I wish to refer is one that presented an equally easy diagnosis, and where the result of the operation itself was more satisfactory, though the ultimate issue of the case was fatal. The case runs as follows :— iMrs. M., ret. 32, admitted to Ward 28 on November 22, 1894. Complaint.—Pain in the left side, lasting for two years. During the past month this pain was very much aggravated on three occasions with symptoms of collapse, continuing for a few hours. History.—Menstruation.—Up till two years ago, normal and regular; since then, marked premenstrual dysmenorrhoea, and on the first and third days of the flow. Has not men- struated for the last eleven weeks. Famihj.—Four children, the youngest, let. 3|; one niis- carria!J:e between the second and third children. Present illness.—On October 22, having missed two periods, patient lifted a heavy weight and felt “ something crack ” (as she said) in her left side. Two days after, severe pain set in with collapse, lasting for two hours, and this was followed by slight vaginal Inemorrhage. Subsequent to this date, before admission, she had two other similar attacks.

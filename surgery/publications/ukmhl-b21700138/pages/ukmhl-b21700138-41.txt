25 A GROUP OF ABDOMINAL SECTIONS. by vomiting. When seen later on, the abdominal pain was general and intensely severe, and could only be modified, not entirely relieved, by large opiates. Through the tender abdominal walls a tumour could l)e recognised, cystic in character, and passing up from the pelvis on the right side to midway between pubes and umbilicus. The nature of tlie case was obvious enough. Two days after, the tumour was removed with entirely satisfactoi-y results. The temperature at the time of operation was 10dÂ°, and pulse IdO. The relief to the patient was im- mediate. The tumour showed intense congestion, not only in its walls and contents, l)ut in the tube also. The pedicle was twisted four times. Case 2.'34 was seen l>y Dr. Cappie on September IG, apparently suffering from acute peritonitis, which had come on early in the inorning after an extra exertion in cleaning. Dr. Cappie recognised the general peritonitis, and, passing his liand over the abdomen, felt the tumour. Next day he asked mo to see the case witli him. T 0]>erated two days after, while still the peritonitis was marked, and removed the tumour, which is represented in Figure G, sliowing a well-marked twisted pedicle (tliere were altogether twelve twists), and thougli tlie adhesions were many, they were recent and easily managed. The patient did absolutely well, witliout a single hitch. Compare tliis again with Case 210, which had l.ieen seen early in Xovem1)er 1889, and diagnosed as an ovarian Fig. 6.

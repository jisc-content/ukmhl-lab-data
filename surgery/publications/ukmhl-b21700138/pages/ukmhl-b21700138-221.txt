205 SACCULATED PREGNANT UTERUS. the physical exaiiiinatiou of the tuinour, rendered no otlier diagnosis possible. I accordingly operated, and on 0})ening the abdomen found, as I expected, a large semisolid oyarian tumour. On attempting to remoye it, howeyer, 1 found a second tumour on the left side, reacliing up to near the um- l)ilicus, unconnected with the oyarian mass. Its real nature I at first did not recognise. The oyarian tumour was pedi- culated and remoyed without any great difficulty. The fact of its being pediculated showed that it had no relation to tlie pelyic mass below. The i>oint, howeyer, of main interest is tliis, that, projecting from the lower edge of the oyarian tumour, there was a hard, solid projection, firmly impacted against the soft mass to which I have just referred, and slightly adherent to it. This projection pressed over tlie brim of the pelvis, deeply indenting and dividing into an upper and a lower half what turned out to be the pregnant uterus. After recognising the condition of matters, I removed the ovarian tumour. Two days afterwards the patient showed signs of labour. I examined her per vaginam, and could just manage to reach the os and feel the projecting head. Owing to the alxlominal wound and recent operation, I dilated as rapidly as I could, and delivered with forceps a foetus between G and 7 months old. In this case the lower segment of the uterus contained the head, and the upper the trunk and extremities. The cause producing this sacculated condition was ol)- viously the growth of the ovarian projection imri 'passii with the development of pregnancy. Case 2 illustrates the production of this abnormally, from a different cause. In 188G I saw a patient suffering from a large pelvic abscess, which was pointing through the vaginal roof. She had missed two j>eri(xls, supposed to he due to exhaustion and anaemia consequent on the abscess. The abscess cavity was drained, and patient quite recovered.

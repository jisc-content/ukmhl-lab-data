43 EARLY EXTRA-UTERINE GESTATION. ligament below, and so removed the mass. I left in a drainage tnbe for some hours. The patient made an uninter- rupted recovery. The macroscopic and microscopic examina- tion proved it to he an extra-uterine pregnancy aljout the eighth week. This case proves beyond rpiestion the possibility of deciding tlie presence of an extra-uterine foetation, and removing it succe.ssfully before rupture, provided only pains and care be taken in watching the symptoms as tliey develop. “ Any man who gives an opinion that he diagnosed a tubal pregnancy, merely upon the unaided discrimination of .symptoms tjr the dim light of a pelvic examination, I regard with so much suspicion, that I do not accept his evidence for argument, save under exceptional circumstances.” Such is Tait’s opinion. It is certainly not wanting in strength. Now, the record of these three cases shows very plainly the difficulties which surround the diagnosis of extra-uterine pregnancy, not only before but after rupture; but the case which I descri1)e last goes far to show that, with careful watching, a case of early extra-uterine pregnancy can be tliagnosed with a verv considerable amount of certainty. Certainly there is no one symptom or sign, such as in ordinary pregnancy, which is pathognomonic ; and, more than that, there seems to bo no one symptom or sign which is even of greater value than another ; Imt upon the following four grounds, if seen early and watched carefully, a diagnosis can be made with a very great amount of precision :— 1. The general signs of pregnancy—for example, the cessation of the menses. '2. The displacement of tlie uterus to one side by a tumoiir, which gradually grows.

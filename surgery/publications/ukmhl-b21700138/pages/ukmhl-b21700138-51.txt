A GROUP OF ABDOMINAL SECTIONS. 35 ensiforiii cartilage, and its dimensions were larger tlian a full- time pregnancy. The history of her case was, that six montlis previously she had suffered, after three montiisâ€™ menstrual suppression, from acute pains in her left side. Accompany- ing the pain there was also marketl collapse, and tlie patient was in imminent danger for some days. From that time until I saw her she had occasionally small luemorrhages, and now and tlien attacks of pain, whicli were most properly attributed to peritonitis. On examination, the foetus could he felt lying oldiquely across the abdomen, and enveloped in fluid. Tlie uterine souffle and foetal heart were plainy audible. Per vaginam the uterus could l)e felt enlarged and to the rigid side, as l)ig as a large jargonelle pear, and separate from the abdominal mass. Tlie diagnosis lay lietween a ]iregnancy in a liicornuous uterus and an extra-uterine pregnancy. I inclined to the latter. She was brought into Edinburg]i, and two days later labour set in in the small uterus. The pains were regular. Gradually the os opened, and the first stage of labour was complete. I introduced my fingers and found the decidua separating in shreds; gradually the labour pain increased in severity, and the decidua were shed off. Then the labour ended, being, it will be observed, an exact counterpart of the phenomena which occurs in ordinary parturition. Three days later I operated, and removed a full-time fcetus. The naked-eye and microscopic anatomy was pub- lished in detail by JJr. Webster later on. From the nature of the case, the death of the patient was almost inevitable. I am indebted to the most careful and untiring work of Dr. A\Abster for a complete knowledge of the nature of the case, which, so far as I know, is unique. The case was found to be tubo-peritoneal, partly extra- and ]>artly intra-peritoneal.

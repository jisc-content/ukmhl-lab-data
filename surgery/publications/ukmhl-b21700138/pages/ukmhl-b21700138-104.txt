88 CLINICAL PAPERS. produced syniptoiiis of hysteria and a mental condition bordering on melancliolia. riiysical examination showed the presence of an acute antetlexion of the uterus, with chronic endometritis and col- pitis, with lesions of the os. Nothing abnormal was found in the uterine annexa. On seeing her again at the time of her internienstrual pain, he came to the conclusion that the mucous discharge was most copious when the feeling of heaviness in the pelvis was most marked, pointing to a congestion in the pelvic organs. Fasbender’s view of the etiology of mittel- schnierz is that, accepting Idliiger’s theory of menstruation, we have in some cases a ])remature summation of nervous stimuli in the ovary, with the occurrence of ovulation, caused either by a delicately organised and excitable state of the whole nervous system, or of the nerves of the ovary, the latter state produced by a pathological condition of the ovary. This abnormal irritability leading to dehiscence of a follicle, some fourteen days before the proper menstrual period, i)roduces the congestive condition of the pelvic organs found in cases examined at such a time. In the discussion which followed the reading of Fas- bender’s paper several additional cases were cited and opinions expressed. Two gentlemen cited cases where the internienstrual pain had occurred in women suffering from anteflexion of the uterus; and a third suggested the antetlexion as the cause of the mittelschmerz, the pain lieing due to contraction of the uterus, trying to expel retained blooil, etc. To this it was replied that, in the observed cases, no contractions of the uterus could be discovered ; and, further, antetlexion was not present in all cases of mittelschmerz ; while, if it were caused by antetlexion, mittelschmerz would be a much comnionei’ symptom than it is. ^Mittelschmerz with a slight How of blood is also described by Benicke as occurring in a case where there was a conical

The patient, wlio had always been averse to the attendance of a doctor, only allowed the nurse to send for me after slie had Ijeen in lal)our ten hours, when she was worn out and desirous of having chloroform administered. I administered chloroform ; and as the liead was small and well down on the perineum, 1 allowed nature to complete the case. The liead was liorn with the occijmt backwards lialf an hour after my arrival. On the third day post-i)artum she again complained of retention of urine. Before using the catheter, I insisted on a vaginal e.xamination, which was sulmiitted to with reluctance. I found the perineum without any fresh tear. On the riglit pelvic wall I found a distinct solution of continuity, sutticient to admit easily the tip of my forefinger. Its location was just over the site of tlie previous injury. The cervix was bilaterally fissured, the riglit side being the deeper; otherwise the parts were normal. Before leaving the ])atient at the month’s end, I was allowed an examination, when I found the sinus healing, but not closed. The records of these cases show a marked similarity. In each there is a special cranial position, and a special pelvic lesion along with it. Judging from the foregoing cases,—given a right occipito- posterior position of the vertex, delayed in its rotation at a particular point in the pelvis, a more or less deep injury to the soft resulting in a sinus, is likely to occur. Injuries and lacerations of vagina are common enough in labour with a contracted pelvis. Schroder has drawn attention to this. Angus Macdonald, ^ in an instructive ]iaper on occipito- jKisterior positions, makes a short reference to laceration of the soft parts. He writes as follows:—“ Of those which terminated face to })ubes, four of the mothers were ])rimiparic, and two multiparjc.” In those six cases which ended as

CLINICAL PAPERS. 152 was so severe as to withdraw the girl from active duties every mouth. On one occasiou her suiferiiig was so severe that slie had to have chloroform administered. After due consultation with her friends, the cervix was dilated, and for the two suc- ceeding months she was quite free from her dysmenorrhoea; but at the third month it returned, and she l)ecanie violently maniacal, and lier mental equilibrium has been very much upset ever since, so much so that her marriage has had to l)e abandoned. It is unnecessary to multiply cases of mental changes following minor operations, but one could mention otliers, though fortunately less pronounced and attended witli happier results than those just cited. Though I have not myself seen any cases of insanity after perineal repair, yet Kelly records six cases of insanity after perineal operations, and one of these died in acute mania. When one comes to pass from minor to major operations, of course the field is wider, and in tlie following example it will be found that mental and fatal conditions are by no means unassociated witli the major operations in gymecology. The case is as follows:— Case 5.—Tlie patient was a married woman, apparently in robust health, witli a simple ovarian tumour. There were no adhesions and no difficulty whatever in the operation, which lasted ten minutes. It went off without a hitcli of any description, and the prognosis was tlierefore perfectly favour- able. To sliow how careful one ouQ-ht to be, I niio-ht mention that, after the operation was over, the liusband asked if there was any necessity for him to remain in Edinburgh. Tlie answer was in the negative ; he was told that his wife was perfectly well, and there was no likelihood of any hitch occurring, and he left for a distant part of the country. The following day the patient liecame acutely maniacal, had to be held down in bed, and died of exhaustion in four days.

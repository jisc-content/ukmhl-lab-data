ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC TUMOURS. 19 attacliment of any kind. Xo ligatures were recjuired, there being nothing to secure, and there was no ha?niorrhage. The [»atient made a good re- covery, and subsequently hecanie pregnant. The walls of the tumour, on examination, were found to be those of the Fallo- pian tube much thinned, and tlie contents old blood clot. It was therefore a case of luematosalpinx, whether from an early extra-uterine pregnancy, it Fig. 5. is impossible to say. I know of no other possible explanation of this anomaly. So far as I can discover, I can find no reference to detached ovarian tumours or cystic tumours without some definite relation to an abdominal or pelvic organ. It is true that Sir James Simpson ^ says he has seen several cases in the dead body, in which tumours were lying free in the abdominal cavity, but he gives no details, and evidently refers to fibroids, as he says that the tumours had no connection with the uterus. Witli regard to some of the tumours I have just referred to, they must be very rare, but tlie case is somewhat different when we come to speak of fibroids; and they may be in tliis connection looked at under three heads:—(1) Fibroids with slight attachments to the uterus : (2) those actually detached ; {o) those detached from the uterus, but adherent to other structures. 1. With regard to semi-detached fibroids, the followiusr two cases may be of interest, in winch the pedicle presented peculiar features, with unexpected results in dealing with it. ^ “Diseases of Women,” p. 667.

57 SESSILE CYSTS. growing downwards between the layers of the broad ligament. Hence the upper portion offered no difficulty, while the lower portion was sessile and intra-ligamentous. From a clinical aspect, cysts of the internal generative organs may he classified as follows:— 1. Arising from the ovary, and loosely connected to the appendages by a pedicle. 2. Connected with the lu’oad ligament, also pedunculated. 2). Having their origin in the ovary, or in one of the structures situated in the broad ligament, burrowing in the broad ligament, and ultimately extending beyond that struc- ture to gain attachment to the pelvic walls or to the viscera— sessile cysts. The scope of the present paper does not permit of my entering into any consideration of those small sessile cysts which frequently affect the appendages, but whicli are not of sufficient magnitude to be of any clinical significance. Within the last decade sessile cysts have obtained a new interest in abdominal surgery, inasmuch as, in a great majority of instances, they are capable of removal, no doubt with con- siderable difficulty, by a method of treatment designated “ enucleation.” The tumours which incline to spread beyond the broad ligament into the pelvic cellular tissue, or extraperitoneally into tlie abdomen, are in the majority of cases— 1. I’apillary cystomata (Olshausen), paroophoritic cysts (Bland Sutton). 2. Parovarian cysts (cysts of the broad ligament). .'b Other broad ligament cysts. Bland Sutton recognises three distinct reg:ions in the appendages, which give rise to their own peculiar cysts. These are— 1. The obphoron, giving origin to the usual ovarian multilocular and unilocular cysts ; [Continued on j^age 60.

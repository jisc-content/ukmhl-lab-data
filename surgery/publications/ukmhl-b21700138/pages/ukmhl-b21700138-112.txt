The opportunities of the Edinburgh Infirmary and of private practice give ns, alas, only too ani])le scope for seeing and diagnosing cancer, and my own sphere of experience has been a reasonably large one; and I rej)eat, that in all these years fourteen only have been seen early enougli to render a success- ful issue luâ€™^diable, and these have died within a year of operation. As a further explanation of the discrepancy, may I venture to suggest, without multiplying exaiii])les, that within my own personal knowledge cases of marked cervical catarrh with gross erosions have been regarded as cervical cancer, and removed as such, and it is very easy to mistake an advanced senile uterine catarrh of a pronounced type for a fundal cancer. In my own cases I need hardly sav that, before operation was undertaken, in each of them the sus- pected tissue was examined microscopically, and the diagnosis thus absolutely established. It is true some gymecological surgeons tell us that, as the senile uterus is of no further use, when there is any doubt it is better removed : and, for example, they will tell us further that, after removing the ovaries by the vaginal route, the uterus may as well also be removed for the same reason ; 1)ut, I ask you, is this surgery ? The ablation of an organ because it is of no further use, is no argument; the point in surgery, so far as I see, is oidy to remove those (Ugans, or those portions of organs, which are absolutely diseased, and which shorten life, or are seriouslv

Sessile Cysts. Sessile cysts form a variety of ovarian tumour which is always of special interest, both with regard to their management and diagnosis. Ovariotomy is now so tlioroughly well under- stood, tliat one can nearly always rely upon a fairly accurate diagnosis and on uniform success. Formerly many of the individual operations in a series of abdominal sections were described by the surgeon as having l)een incomplete, due to the fact that the operator discovered the wall of the cystic growth in most intimate connection with the peritoneum and appendages, or the base of the tumour lirmly adherent in the pelvic cavity, and where removal was apparently an impossibility. From the table of cases on the following pages I give only two in detail, respectively ISTos. 352 and 353 :— Case 352.—On per vaginam examination the uterus was found to Ije small, and no trace of a tumour was revealed. On 0})ening the aljdonien, one was immediately struck with the dee]), dark red, congested ap])earance of the tumour, and the large veins which ramihed in great variety over the surface. Its walls were extremely tense. It presented characteristics, in short, closely simulating a pregnant uterus. On passing tlie hand into tlie abdomen, I found no adhesions ; on carrying it deeply down into the right side of tlie ])elvis, I felt the tumour to Ije continuous with tlie uterus itself, and no sus- ])icion of a ]>edicle was to be discovered; on tlie left side the ])eritoneum seemed to lie so reflected as to prevent the hand ]»assing further down than the lirim of the pelvis.

This asymmetry, though characteristic of the female bladder generally, is so constantly i»resent in the bladders of parous women, that it may be regarded as the normal condition. There is a fallacy, however, in assuming that a l)ladder will distend when removed from the body, or even in the body after the viscera have been removed, in the same way as it would in the closed abdominal cavity. For instance, in a section of a female ])elvis of a girl, ict. 18, by Legendre, he shows the bladder distended, not as one would ex])ect in a young girl. Lraune, referring to this, mentions that it ])robahly arose from the Ijladder being distended after the viscus was removed. 2. The right lateral expansion of the l)ladder immediately after labour is fav(jured Ijy tlie condition of matters ante- ])artum. Thus the bladder is flattened under the anterior and lower segment (»f uterus, aiid if careful sounding of the Idadder is made it will be found, as 1 have shown eLsewhere, that while little space is left on left side, the bladder is free on the right, owing, no doubt, to the preponderance of L.O.A. position. It seems to me that if the uterus were a perfectly free body, not biassed by any deviation to one side or another, the effect of the filling of the bladder would be first to raise it, and then to deflect it to the left. 1 have made f<jur ex})eriments in women in whom, during ])regnancy, there was no lateral deviation to be noted, and in whom the position of the pelvis was as nearly horizontal, and in each the uterus, with an eni])ty bladder, was central. In each case the uterus, with full bladder, was hfi and bladder luniour right. In each, uterus during ja'egnancy central. On morning of third day l)ladiler and rectum empty, patient supine, uterus central. Case 1.—Distinct vesical tumour; direction upwards and to right; uterus ])ushed to left, A in. above umbilicus ;

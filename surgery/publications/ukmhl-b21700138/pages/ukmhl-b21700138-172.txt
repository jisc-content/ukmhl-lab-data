CLINICAL PAPERS. 156 "When one recognises the frequency with which mental troubles are apparently associated with the normal occurrence of changes—such as puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and the menopause—it may be considered almost remarkable that women escape from these disorders as easily as they do. One does not wish here and now to enter upon the great subject of operations undertaken in insane women, with a view to eifecting a cure of the mental disease, Ijy operative treat- ment of the genital organs. That is a field in which there is a good deal to be said, but it seems to me that under no circum- stances ought any insane woman to be operated upon, unless for some distinct condition which is compromising life. The cases in which the ovaries have Ijeen removed, and other operations performed, with a view to intiuencing insane or hysterical conditions, are many, and I fear tlie results are exceedingly discouraging. One’s own experience of hystero- epilepsy is coni|)aratively limited. I liave operated on only one case where the symptoms were extremely marked, and after the removal of the ovaries the catamenia ceased, and the hystero-epileptic symptoms disappeared ; but after some years the patient was lost sight of, and therefore I cannot tell whether or not the cure was al)solutely complete. It is quite certain that after any degenerative processes have occurred in the brain cells, it is absolutely useless to look for any mental cure by any form of operation on the genital organs. The relation of gymecology to psychiatry has been mucli discussed in late years, and I think the general consensus of opinion, gathered from alienists and neurologists alike, is that, while it has a place amongst tlie insane, just as among tlie sane, for the relief of pliysical distress, yet as a great curative method in tlie treatment of insanity it plays a comparatively small and unimportant ]iart.

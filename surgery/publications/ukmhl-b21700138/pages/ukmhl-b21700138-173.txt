Two Cases of Mistaken Sex in Adult Life. Neugebauer, iu a recent paperrecounts fifty cases in which a marriage took place between two persons who after- wards were fonnd to be of the same sex. The article is meant to show the importance of making early discovery of such cases, in order to save the miserable consequences, unhappiness, divorce suits, even suicides, which may follow if they are not recognised and are allowed to proceed in error; and to demonstrate the responsibility which is incurred by a doctor when giving a definite opinion in cases of douhtful sex. That it is hy no means easy in all cases, especially before puberty, to determine the sex, is certain; but many of such cases are never brought to the doctor at all. In the ffreat majority of cases, a male is mistaken for a female, which naturally leads to greater difficulty in the matter of examina- tion. Of the fifty cases recorded in the paper to which I have alluded, forty-six were cases in which a man was married by mistake for a woman; only three were cases in which a woman was married as a man. In the remaining case it was said that one of the patients was hermaphrodite. Foreign medical literature abounds in copious records of cases of this sort, but, so far as I know, few cases are met with, or at least are recorded, in this country, and a record of two cases of mistaken sex occurring in members of the same family, and which is perfectly authentic, cannot be without interest and value.

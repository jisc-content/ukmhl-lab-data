CLINICAL PAPERS. 62 cysts may liave only a few nodules studded on the internal surface of their walls.. These ])apilloinata are generally of small size, being no larger than a walnut; but, in tlie case previously alluded to, 1 removed two cauliflower-like masses, one of the size of a walnut, and one, which was firmly adherent to the pelvic structures, of a diameter greater than that of a large orange. These tumours are rare before the 25th vear, and occur most frc(|uently l)etween 25 and 50. Occasionally, they are associated with dermoids and sarcomata of the ovary. One of their most notable features is their great tendency to metastasis. When ru])ture of the cyst takes place, there is a rapid and often fatal papillomatous infection of the peri- toneal surfaces of the abdominal cavity. This speedily gives rise to ascites, which, after the peritoneal cavity has been depleted, rapidly accumulates again. Tortunately, however, it is not the invariable result, as, after removal of the primary tumour, the metastatic growths sometimes cease to develop further, and ascites does not result. II. Parovakiax Cysts. In descriliing tlie nature of these tumours, and of cysts of the broad ligament, I have followed the more recent theories regarding their origin and pathology, especially those advanced by Doran, as they seem to me to give a l)etter scientific ex- planation of the clinical manifestations than has been presented hitherto. Their true origin can only l.ie arrived at after careful investigation, not only of the large, fully developed cysts, but of the relations and position of such smaller cysts as are pro tempore of no clinical significance, but which have the inherent ])ossibility of a further increase only limited by the pelvi- al)dominaI capacity. Oidy those cysts which originate in some part of the

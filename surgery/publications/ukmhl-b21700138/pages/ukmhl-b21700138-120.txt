104 CLINICAL PAPERS. or wliicli I luive seeu iu iiiy own cousulting-rooiii. 1 liave not included tliose cases seen in the out-patient department, and of tliose whicli 1 luive seen in consultation in jirivate 1 have kept no record. Hence, therefore, the experience which I am putting liefore you may seem rather less than might have been expected. 2. The talile im p. 10.‘I includes all the cases of cancer of the uterus for which I have performed vaginal hysterectomy, except two, and those two were done in my earlier years, and were, in some respects, incomplete. On that account thev must be omitted in estimatim>: the value of the operation. The fourteen now recorded were performed with all the most recent inijirovements in the operation ; and, save one, they were comiilete in every detail.

Each one of those fourteen cases was most carefully selected; all the others, if interfered with at all, were only dealt with l)y tlie ordinary palliative measures. 3. These cases include all the recognised forms of cancer affecting the cervix and the body of the uterus. It would l)e a work of supererogation to describe each case of those o})erated upon in detail; nor have T any intention of referring to those cases in wliicli merely palliative operative interferences were employed, such as amputation of the cervix, and the employment of tlie cautery, etc. ; l)ut 1 refer only to those iu wliich 1 performed vaginal hysterectomy. First let me take a hospital case. Case 1.—A widow, mother of four children, a worker in a Dundee mill, presented herself at the hos})ital, com])laining of slight pain in the back, and menorrhagia. Now there was no leucorrhoca, no foetid discharge, no bleeding, and no

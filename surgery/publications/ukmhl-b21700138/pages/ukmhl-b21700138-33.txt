ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC TUMOURS. 17 were intact. What it really was 1 regret to say I cannot tell, because the preparation was unfortunately destroyed immediately after the operation, through some misunder- standing. Here, again, it is remarkaljle that a tumour of such size should have maintained an independent existence in the abdominal cavity, with only a slight adhesion to tlie abdominal wall. I have twice been called up(.)ii to operate on tumours occupying the pouch of Douglas, giving rise especially to l)ladder trouble, and in which, after the lapse of a week or two between the diagnosis and the day of the operation, the tumours have completely disappeared, rendering, of course, operative interference unnecessary. As no operation was performed, and fortunately no autopsy necessary, I can only surmise that these tumours were parovaiian cysts, whose contents were perfectly harmless, which had ruptured and collapsed. I have seen a somewhat similar case of a pear-shaped tumour on the left side of the uterus in a woman ait. 35, married, with three children, suffering from constant pain in the side, premenstrual dysmenorrhcea, menorrhagia, and leu- corrhcea. From the shape of the swelling, the symptoms it gave rise to, the easy recognition of the ovary, and the apex of the tumour running into the uterus, I regarded it as a dilated Fallopian tube. Between seeing her at the hospital and her return for operation, a fortnight later, the tumour had entirely disappeared, leaving nothing but a slight fulness in the fornix. As no untoward symptoms resulted from its dis- appearance, it was either a ruptured hydrosalpinx or a hydrops tubae profluens. Case 5.â€”Another remarkable case of a disappearance of an abdominal tumour is that of Mrs. >S., who was sent to me by Dr. Jolm Moir of St. Andrews, in January 1895. She was admitted to my ward, suffering from a large abdominal

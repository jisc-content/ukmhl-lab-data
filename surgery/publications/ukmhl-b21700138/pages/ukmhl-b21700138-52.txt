The Diagnosis of Early Extra-nterine (lestation, witli Illustrative Cases. Thouuii the ditticulties suiTOundiii”- the accurate diamiosis of early extra-uteriiie pregnancy are nninerons, and for the most ])art well recognised, yet it is at once cnrions and dis- a})pointing to find such a variance of o])inion. For instance, 'I'ait virtually says that it cannot be made until after rupture ; and although this is too general and dogmatic, yet it is, so far as my experience goes, in the main true. Nevertheless Aveliug asserts “ that it has so many prominent and cliar- acteristic symptoms, that its detection is more easy then tlian that of an ordinary pregnancy in tlie early months.” Fames maintains that the diagnosis of tuhal pregnane}' may with ease be made al)out the seventh or eightli week. It would serve no good pui’pose to i-ecapitulate all (»r even a selection of the opinions that have been advanced as to the probability or certainty of diagnosis of early extra- uterine feetation. It seems to me that, in odering any remarks on tlie subject, they shmdd l)e based on personal experience and by tlie record of actual cases. First of all, wliat are the definite signs or symptoms to wliich authors attacli im])ortance in the diagnosis of tlie condition ? and, second, what tlie value of these signs in cases which have come imder my own ol)servation ? Now, witli regard to the signs and symptoms of extra- uterine gestation iii tlie early months, they may be arranged thus. I do not at all mean to say that this is the most satisfactory classification, but it includes the various signs alluded to, and at the same time indicates the value of each.

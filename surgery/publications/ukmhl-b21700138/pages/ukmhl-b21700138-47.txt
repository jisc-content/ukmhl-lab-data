A GROUP OF ABDOMINAL SECTIONS. amount of peritoneum was of course corresponding]}' great. Certainly, enucleation of ovarian or broad ligament cysts is an enormous addition to the possibilities of abdominal surgery, and, tliougli retpiiring care and trouble, gives, at least when tlie tumour is small, excellent results. 4. The following case illustrates the need of careful drainage and washino-:â€” O The most interestiucf of these was Case 201. She was O a lady of 38 years of age, sent to me by Dr. IMacnee of Inverness, and on opening her abdomen I found an ovarian tumour about the size of an ordinary football. After empty- ing the cyst, and separating the adhesions above, I found there was no trace of })edicle whatever. I therefore pro- ceeded to enucleate, and, having made an incision in the peritoneum towards the Ijase of the tumour, I succeeded in separating the one from the other. The remaining peri- toneum and broad ligament had to be secured by separate ligatures in three places. The peritoneal cavity was care- fully washed out, but no drainage tube was used. Three days afterwards patient showed symptoms of internal haemor- rhage ; I tlierefore placed her under chloroform and reopened lier abdomen, and removed several pints of dark foetid blood. I again waslied her al)domen carefully out, put in a drainage tube, and for six weeks there was a continuous outpouring of dark foetid blood. Each day the cavity was washed out; and at tlie end of two months she went back to Inverness quite well. 5. In my last sixty cases of abdominal section there have l)een three hysterectomies, all of which proved successful. The first two were for fibro-cystic tumours of the uterus. The only points of interest about them were, that in l.)ot]i 1 freed the broad ligaments; and what seems to me equally

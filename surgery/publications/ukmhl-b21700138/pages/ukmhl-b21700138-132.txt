CLINICAL PAPERS. 116 snlfered from a large semisolid ovarian tumour. Xothiug ill the case led me to suppose that the tumour was anything else. ] had all the preparations made for the operation, and a week after my first examination, and the day before the operation, the patient aliorted of a four-months foetus. I need scarcely say that I was surprised, and at tlie same time rather crestfallen in my diagnosis. The tumour remained after the abortion jiretty much as it was before. Three weeks afterwards, 1 opened the patient’s abdomen, and found that the tumour was a large fibrocystic tumour of the uterus, almost a counterpart of the jirevious one, with diffuse peri- tonitis. After securing the stum]) of the tumour with tlie elastic ligature and the delta wire and Koeberle clamp, 1 examined the pelvis, and found on the right side an ovarian tumour about the size of an ordinary cocoanut. This I also removed ; and, on examining further into the pelvis, 1 found that the uterus, as in the preceding case, was bicornuous; that while the left horn had contained a four-months ovum, the right horn, into which I had introduced the sound, was empty and small. The patient made an excellent recovery. She passed, two days after the operation, a complete decidua, apparently from the empty horn. This is specially interest- ing, as the operation was performed three weeks after the abortion. These two cases seem to me of importance, first, because of the rarity of a bicornuous uterus. In both cases the left horn was pregnant and the right horn empty. In both cases the tumour was fil)rocystic and growing from the empty horn. Toth were large, the peritonitis recent, the adhesions numerous, and the operation long and tedious. The uterus, furtlier, in both cases had not by any means completely involuted. The following case illustrates well dystocia from impaction, due to a pedunculated myoma :— 1 saw the case witli the late Dr. Sinclair. He had been

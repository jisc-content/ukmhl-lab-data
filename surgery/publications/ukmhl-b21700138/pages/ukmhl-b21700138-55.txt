£A RLY EXTRA- UTERINE GESTA TION. 39 stances, I should be disposed to tlo again as I did, thongli with a feeling both of doubt and misgiving. I do not know that the opening of the abdomen hastened the patient’s death, but it certainly proved the utter in- sutliciency of acting on the generally recognised signs and symptoms of extra-nterine pregnancy. The case was to me more a warning than a lesson, and does not by any means add to onr satisfaction in operating. Case 2.—i\Irs. i\I., married, one child four years previously, was lu'onght to Ward 28, suttering from irregular lueniorrhages.

The diagnosis forced upon me was an extra-uterine pregnancy between tiie twelfth and fifteenth week ; and 1 thiidv that the physical conditions ju.stitied the diagnosis. The

On the Etiology of Ahiginal Hsematoma occurring during Labour. Sanguineous tumours, thrombi and haematoma, of the vulva and vagina, whether occurring before, during, or after labour, are comparatively rare accidents. Under sucli a lie'ad- ing are included all collections of blood forming in the sub- mucous or connective tissue, and they may be found in the cervix, any part of the vagina, labia, or perimetric connective tissue. The condition receives more or less attention in every text-book, and the varieties, with their progress, terminations, and treatment, have been exhaustively discussed, in lengthened memoirs, by Deneux, Laborie, Cazeaux, Hervieux, Hugenberger, and Barnes, and have received shorter notice from many others. Into the question of the nature and management of these haemorrhages in general it is no part of my present purpose to enter. I wish, therefore, to eliminate, first, the blood extravasations which are limited to the cervix, and which in a minor form are familiar to most of us. In an aggravated and serious form they are at times associated with elongation and hypertrophy. This much I wish to point out, that they are the results of direct pressure and crashing. Second, those which form in the labia vulv.a?, and which are the result of unusual lu'essure apjdied to already distended and varicose vessels. ]\Iy remarks apply entirely to that form of hamiatoma which is vaginal, usually confined to the posterior wall, and is developed during and after labour. Three such cases have come under my observation, and I now give a brief record of each.

The lower part having lieen cleared of blood clot, I pushed my finger through the septum into the upper, and here 1 found a large amount of Idood clot; but besides, from the left side, I was able to remove a large amount of placental tissue, and here also I came upon the umbilical cord. On tracing this up- wards, I found the foetus, wdiich showed no sign of decom- position, was be- tween three and a halfand four months, and was easily re- moved. The whole sac was then thor- oughly cleared and washed out, and thereafter packed with iodoform gauze. A few stitches were used to ensure the adhesion of the sac to the al.xlominal wall.

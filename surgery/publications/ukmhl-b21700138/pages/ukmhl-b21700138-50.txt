CLINICAL rAPERS. 34 fore l’oiTO-Cii‘sareciii was performed on the hOth April last. This was, as I anticipated, sini])le and rapid, il'he incision was made from uml)ilicus to pul)es, and the nterns rapidly ex})Osed. il'lie uterus was pi'cssed up close to the abdominal wound, and made to protrude somewhat through it.

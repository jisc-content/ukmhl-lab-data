]\littelsclimerz. I do not propose to enter into a general discussion of dysmenorrha?a. The object of the present coinmiinication is to discuss a form of dysnienorrhcea, l>y courtesy so called, which occurs, not at the period when the external manifesta- tion of menstruation takes jdace, hut at mid-term—a condition to which tlie Germans have given an appropriate name, “ IMittelschmerz,” and which the French liave, less felicitously, called “ Dysmchiorrhee intermenstruelle.” Whatever name may he applied to it—and certainly intermenstrual dysmenor- rhoea is not suitable—the condition is a well-marked one, wlierein an attack of dysmenorrhuea proper is simulated, without necessarily any external lueniorrhage. It does not at all resemble the ])renienstrual pain, or the continued pain associated with inilanied or diseased ovaries, but it is a condition which occurs definitely each month, at a definite period and for a definite numher of days. So far as I am aware, the condition was first of all described by Sir William Priestley many years ago, and it has l.)een also discussed by Fasbender and Sorel. I will now recount the more important points of some cases occurring in my own experience, which may he taken as fairly typical. Case 1 was tliat of a young girl, a4. 18, whom I first saw at Professor Simpson’s private clinique somewhere about the year 1873. She coni])lained of acute pain, sometimes in one side and sometimes in the other, occurring with the utmost regularity, fourteen or fifteen days after her menstruation.

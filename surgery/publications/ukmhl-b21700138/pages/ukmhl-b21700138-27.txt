The mammary outline is much less distinct, and the dark areola has somewhat faded. The liuea nigra is less distinct, but tliere appears to he rather an increase of hair on the pubis. The laliia minora, which had been large and dark, have now assumed a normal size and colour, and are less gaping; while the vaginal mucous membrane, previously dark and injected, has become of a normal pinkish colour.

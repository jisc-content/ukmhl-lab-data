OCCIPITO-POSTERIOR POSITIONS OF VERTEX. 201 (2) Because tlie pressure of the posterior pelvic wall will act more ou the occiput than the sinciput, thus tending to drive the occiput forward. 3. Because the occipital arm is the shorter of the cephalic lever, and the pressure bears more directly on tlie force resisting it than on the force resisting the longer arm. Although, in this school, the lever theory, as accounting for flexion of the foetal head, has been ably combated by I’rufessor Simpson,^ yet the lesion we have described would seem to negative the condition assumed by Labs - in his conception of the mutual relations of the girdle of contact and the foetal head. Eesults.—It must be admitted that in none of the cases I have recorded were the results to the patient serious, so far as the ultimate issue was concerned. It is none the less true that such lesions may easily become of grave import. 1. In two cases the patient suffered from retention of urine, recpiiring the use of the catheter. This was no doubt due to the vaginal wound, in the same way that retention is observed resulting from perineal tears. 2. The constitutional disturbance was small, and pelvic pain not in any way marked—so much so that, on that account, such injuries are very apt to be overlooked. This is what might be expected in a localised parametritis. 3. Such lesions greatly increase the risks of septiciemia. 4. They may be the starting-point of serious and long- continued parametritis. Two further points recpiire notice— 1. Did the forceps cause the injury ? I think not. The history of Case 4, at all events, conclusively proves that such an injury may occur without any instrumental interference; on the contrary, I believe— 2. That the prevention of the injury is to be looked for ^ Trans. Edin. Obst. Soc., vol. v. p. 75. - “Die Theorie der Geburt,” Bonn, 1877.

Indeed, the face, wlien the child was held in the ordinary position, looked almost directly upwards. On inverting tlie child, the head main- tained the same degree of extension, the face looking directly downwards. During sleep and periods of entire quiescence, the extension, though less pronounced, was still well marked. Throughout the patient’s stay in hospital, a period of ten days, the child continued to carry its head in the same ex- tended p(^sition. On the eleventli and twelfth days post- partum, the extension was somewhat less decided, but a month after labour, when the child was last seen, the position of the liead was one of marked extension. The accompanying diagram—or ratlier portrait, for it is from life—shows the appearance of the child about twelve days Fig. 13. after birth. The other illustration is that of a child, also twelve days after labour, born after a natural labour, in a left occipito- anterior position. Both children were held in the same posi- tion, and the difference in the position of the respective heads is suthciently obvious. Any one who has paid any attention to the attitude of the new-born child must lie aware that when held on tlie knee, for example, with one liand supporting the liack, the position of the head is one of flexion.

CLINICAL PAPERS. I 1 2 Siisserott collected from all sources a series of 147 cases of labour complicated with fibroid tumour ; GO per cent, of these labours were termiuated instrumeiitally. Cask 1.—A woman, let. 05, was adiintted to mv ward. She liad been married five years, and was sterile. She specially sought advice l)ecause of much pain in her left side, associated with irregular haanorrhages. She had not missed a ]>eriod. For a year past her menstruation had been in- creasing in quantity and frequency. Her lucmorrhages were less a source of distress to her than the pain in the left side, associated with a hardness and swelling in that region. The swelling and pain had been the subject of observation for over three months. On examination }>er ^■aginam, a large seniisolid swelling was felt on the left side, filling u]> the fornix, and bimanually it was found projecting over the l)rim of the ]ielvis.

It was considerably enlarged. The cervix was thick, soft, and slightly patulous. There was a well-marked souille all over the ])elvic brim. Though the continued luemorrhage was rather against it, the softness of the uterus pointed to pregnancy, and the right side tumour seemed a dermoid ovarian which had taken on ra|)id growth. A more careful examination per rectum, under chloroform, ])ermittcd the detection of a firm jiedicle, about as thick as two fingers, passing from the left cornu of the uterus. The conclusion arrived at was, that the tumour was a rapidly growing myoma, associated with an early pregnancy. It was clear that the pregnancy—if it were one—could not continue with a tumour of such dimensions and in that situation, and in any case the rapid growth of the tumour and the pain demanded interference. Even if it had been justifiable to

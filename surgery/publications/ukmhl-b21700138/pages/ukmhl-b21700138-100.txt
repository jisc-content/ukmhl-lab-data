CLINICAL PAPERS. 84 This had been the case ever since she was 14, ami she did not he'i’in to inenstrnate until she was IG. There was no abnormality, so far as I conld discover, in the ovaries, tubes, or nterus. I saw her more or less regnlarly for thirteen or fourteen years after she first came under my observation. During all that time slie menstruated with regularity, and her internienstrual sutlerings continued. During the years 1 knew her she occupied various situations in the ca]>acity of a liousemaid. She menstruated regularly and without pain, but every month slie was obliged, in order to avoid lier internienstrual suilering, to use mori)liia ratlier freely.

This was done ; the right ovary was somewliat cystic and the tube thickened ; on tlie left side the ovary was normal, but tliere was a well-marked hydrosal])inx. It is worthy of note, as bearing directly u])on the case, that the woman was ;ct. 35, and she liad siiifered from inter-

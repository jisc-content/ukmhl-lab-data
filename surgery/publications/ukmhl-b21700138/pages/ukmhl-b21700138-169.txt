153 PEL VI-APE OMINAL OPE PA TIONS. Of course it will probably be said that this was the mania or delirium of sepsis, Imt, as a matter of fact, the autopsy showed not a trace of sepsis anywhere. The patient liad no family history of insanity, and was apparently in excellent health. Here, again, one does not wish to enter upon any aljstruse investigation as to how this calamity occurred, but the fact remains that the patient died in acute mania four days after the simplest possible operation, lieference might liere Ije made to the excellent paper by Kelly on this subject, in which lie records eiu’ht cases out of something over 2000 abdominal sections. The record from whicli these cases are taken shows five cases of insanity in over a thousand sections. Of Kelly’s eight cases five recovered completely, two remained insane, and one committed suicide. ]\Iy record obviously is not so satisfactory. The case just referred to is one of acute mania, following a simple operation. Take another case:— Case G.—-The patient liad a rather troublesome ovariotomy performed. There were numerous adhesions; but the case, though somewhat tedious, was nothing unusual. She made an excellent recovery, and remained absolutely well for five davs. On the morning of the seventh dav, wlien the stitches were removed, the wound had completely healed except for one small suppurating stitch-hole. The same evening she became excited. The next day she was still more so, and a day later she became acutely maniacal, and remained so for a week, when she had to be removed from tbe home. She died shortly afterwards. Case 7.—I’erhaps one of the most painful cases was that of a ]iatient upon wliom I performed hysterectomy for a large rapidly growing fil)roid. It is unnecessary to mention the operative details ; suffice it to say that the stump was treated intraperitoneally, and dropped back into the abdomen. The

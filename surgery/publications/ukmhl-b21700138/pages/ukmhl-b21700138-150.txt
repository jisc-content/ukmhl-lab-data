Olivloiis Ascites, with an Illustrative Case. ()l)striicti()u of the thoracic duct, especially if it be oTadiial, may give rise to no symptoms wliatever during life, since anastomotic channels are established througli which the lymph and chyle enter the circulation. However, on the other hand, congestion of the lyin])hatic system may give rise t(j definite signs which can l.)e clinically recognised, and this is especially so when the lacteals of the abdominal cavity are within the area affected.

The sujuu’ficial veins were much distended, tlie skin was somewliat deeply i)igmented, and on deep palpation several irregular hard masses could be detected in the umbilical and epigastric, regions.

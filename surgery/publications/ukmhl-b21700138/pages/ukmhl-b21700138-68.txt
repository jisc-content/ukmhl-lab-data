CLINICAL PAPERS. 52 Ou admission, the physical exaininatioii revealed a well- defined swelling, reaching 2 in. above ronpart’s ligament on the left side, and on vaginal exainination the uterus was felt low down, soft; and behind it, in the pouch of Douglas, an ill-defined swelling could he determined. On November 23 (the day after admission) patient was still in a critical condition of colla})se; pulse 150, small, and temperature 96°, while the severe pain continued. However, she gradually improved, and in a day or two was very much better in every way. On December 2, after the continuance for some hours of severe bearing-down pains, what proved on microscopic examination to be a decidual membrane, was passed, and after this the patient seemed much relieved, and improved so much, that at the end of ten days she wished to leave her bed. On the morning of December 21, patient collapsed again, a more or less continuous hfemorrhage going on for thirt}"- six hours. Dulse was almost uncountable, and indeed, for an hour on the afternoon of the 22nd, it could not l)e felt at all. During her residence in hospital the tumour had gradually grown upwards to within 1 in. of the umbilicus: and, after tlie attacks of December 21 and 22, it rose rapidly till the uj)per limit was 1 in. above the umbilicus. I’atient having rallied from this last attack of internal luemorrhage and collapse, she was placed on the o])erating- table on December 27. The abdominal wall was cut through slightly to the left of the middle line, when it was found that the sac wall was intimately adherent to the parietal peri- toneum. On o])ening into the sac, a large amount of blood clot escaped, and it was then determined that the sac extended in three directions—downwards into the pouch of Douglas, across the middle line 2 or 3 in. below the level of tlie um- Inlicus, and upwards to within 2 in. above and to the left of

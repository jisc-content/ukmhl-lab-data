CLINICAL PAPERS. 178 presenting, 1)ut not engaged in tJie brim. The uterus was markedly auteverted, the patient being a big, heavy woman, witli a very pendulous belly. The uterine body was thrown well forwards, and somewhat Hexed. The delay was evidently caused l>y the misdirection of the uterine force. I placed the woman on her back, and had a binder applied. On introducing my hand some fifteen or twenty minutes later into the vao-ina, I felt a distinct bulgino: in the fundus vagina^ in the posterior fornix. The nature of this I did not at the time recognise. As the head was movable at the brim, and did not engage even after the })Osition of the uterus was rectified, I performed podalic version. 1 found a little diffi- culty in extracting the liead from the vagina. With the last pains the placenta and membranes were expelled cn masse. As violent expulsive efforts continued, and as she complained of great pain, and although there was no hfemorrhage Ijeyond normal, she looked somewhat collapsed, I made a vaginal examination, and found a large tumour ljulging the posterior vaginal wall. It extended in a conical shape, the l>ase being at the vulva and the apex at the cervix. Next morning, when I saw the patient, I found she had passed a restless night. There was pelvic pain, bearing-down expulsive efforts, and retention of urine. On examination, the vagina was so occluded that I could not reach the cervix. The conical nature of the tumour, its intimate connection with the mucous membrane, its firmness and tenderness, as well as the fact that it reached (piite down to and fudged the perineum, combined with a rectal exploration, decided me in coming to the con- clusion that it was a h;ematoma of the vagina. Test, quiet, and opium were enjoined. The next day she was free from ])ain. There was no rupture of any part of the tumour. In four or five weeks the patient was well, and no trace of the tumour remained. Case 3.â€”Through the kindness of Dr. Alex. Sinclair,

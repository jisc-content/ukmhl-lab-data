The following- eases of abdominal section present some features of special interest:— 1. A group of cases of ovariotomy complicated with twisting of the pedicle. T have met with four such cases in my last group of sixty. This accident is at once a com- paratively frecpient and interesting one. It is, further, a very serious one, as records of the post-mortem room abundantly show.^ l’erha})S the most complete essay on the subject is that of Knowsley Thornton,- who found fifty-seven cases out of GOO, upon which he had operated. Schroder, out of ninety-four cases of ovariotomy, had thirteen cases of twisted pedicle. Xothing supports the ])lea for early ovariotomy more than these cases. Nothing indicates more clearlv that an ovarian tumour should be dealt with as soon as it is diagnosed. Take three illustrations, one of delayed and two of })rompt interference. Cask 259. iUrs.

164 CLINICAL PAPERS. ill the accoiiii)aiiyiDg tigure (Fig. 12), which was taken when the patient was completely amcsthetised. Towards the inoiis veneris, and over its most dependent part, the tumour is lull'd and nodular or 'paiyillomatous; but at the side where it is in contact witli tlie thiglis it is soft and smooth, or glahrous, to adopt the usual nomenclature. To indicate its dimensions more exactly than can be shown in any diagram, the measurements were found to be— antero-posterior diameter, 12 in.; lateral, G in.; and vertical, G in. The base of the attacliment, althoiigli being a long one, is somewhat narrower than tlie dependent part of the tumour, so that it is fairly movable, and might be described .as faintly pedunculated. At times the patient suttered great pain in the affected ]>art, and on other occasions it became inhamed and erysipelatous, she herself describing this as “ the rose.” ^ After elevating the tumour so as to cause as complete depletion as possible, the mass was removed by a single sweep of a large amputating knife, and thereafter the in- dividual vessels w^ere dealt with seriatim, the luemorrliage being inconsiderable. As the disease, however, had spread up over the iiioiis veneris, a large quantity of redundant tissue had to be removed by dissection, which added very considerably to the extent of the wound and tlie difficulty of the operation. Idle edges were then drawn together and sutured, and as there was a copious discharge from the gelatinous-like tissue, a drainage tube was introduced at the most dependent part of the wound. This was removed at the end of two days, and the patient has made a good recovery. As to its patliology, the great bulk of tlie tumour appeared to consist of a gelatinous mass diffused over the ^ It is of interest to note in tins connection that in some of those islands where elepliantiasis is not nneonnnon, the disease itself receives the name of “ the rose” from the al)origines.

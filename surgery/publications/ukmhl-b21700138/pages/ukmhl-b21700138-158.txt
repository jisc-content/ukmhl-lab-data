142 CLINICAL JAPERS. ])elvis. Tlie uterus was considerably eubirged—about .‘51, in., bard and globular. In tliis case the diagnosis was again diHicult. The cervix was dilated, the cavity curetted and ])acked. The del)ris, under the microscope, showed no signs of either squamous or adenoid carcinoma. The patient laid no further trouble, and now, after six years, is ])erfectly well. 1 mention the lapse of time simply because it proves there was no tendency to malignancy in the condition.

As 1 have already said, 1 could multi]tly cases to illustrate these types, but I take it that these three illustrate what 1 consider the three forms of senile uterine catarrh:—(1) those associated with fcrtid discharge and no hamiorrhage ; (2) those associated with leucorrhcea and slight hannorrhage; and (53) those in which luemori'hage is the main, if not the only, syin])tom. Of course every one is aware that ]iost-climacteric hamorrhages are due in the main to—(1) the commencement of cancer, or (2) to the recrudescence of a fibroid, or (53)

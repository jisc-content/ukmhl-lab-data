On a Complication of Occipito-Posterior Positions of the Vertex. Though much has been written on tlie subject, occipito- posterior ])Ositions of the vertex offer a wide field for study. The frequency of this deviation from the normal standard is sufficiently marked to warrant us in endeavouring to trace out every complication wliich may accompany tlie position. Without entering fully into statistics, 1 should like to draw attention to the fact that, out of 414 births wliich have taken place in tlie new Maternity Hospital since May 1879 up till the present time (1881), fifty-nine occipito- posterior have occurred, i.e. 14 per cent., or 1 in 7. In the present article I wish to limit myself entirely to an inquiry into one of the complications met with in this form of cranial position. It may be broadly stated that the complications of occipito-posterior position resolve themselves into two setsâ€”(1) those met with in the first stage of labour ; (2) those met with in the second. During the first stage of labour, occipito-posterior positions are unquestionably a common cause of delay. This delay is no doubt frequently enough incorrectly referred to simple rigidity of the cervix. In some cases there may be rigidity as a complication ; but where the parts preserve their normal tone and elasticity, and wliere the head and pelvis are of normal size, delay in dilatation of the cervix, from the position of the head alone, is by no means an uncommon occurrence. The explanation of this delay is not difficult to discover. If a digital examination be made early in the first stage of labour, the finger will recognise, not the

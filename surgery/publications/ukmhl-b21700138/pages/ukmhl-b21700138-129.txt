8 FIBR 01 D TUMO URS D URING PRE GNANC\113 interfere with the ovaries, which in the case of a i>regnant uterus was inadmissible, any attempt at their removal would have been more hazardous than the removal of the fibroid itself, owing to their inaccessible position. The abdomen was accordingly opened and the tumour exposed. It proved a soft nterine myoma. There was no difficulty in dealing with it by double knot, and at the same time sewing u]) very carefully the rest of the pedicle and dropping it back. There was enlargement of the uterus, corresponding to a two-and-a-half months’ pregnancy. The case gave no further trouble. The haemorrhages— which were no doubt due to the rapid growth of the myoma, causing congestion of the decidua and hiemorrhage from tlie lower pole of the uterus, as well as attempts at abortion— ceased, and the patient was delivered at seven months. Case 2.—The patient, tet. 35, had been married for years, and was sterile. Slie was sent to me because of great pain in the left side. Her menstruation, which had been previously irregular and profuse, had been suppressed for two mouths. There was a distinct tumour to be felt over the brim of the pelvis in the left side. It was tender on pressure per vaginam; the tumour could be felt, tender and soft, occupying the entire left fornix. The uterus was enlarged, and thrown to the right side. There were no auscultatory sounds. There seemed to be no communication between the uterus and the tumour. The case was diagnosed as a small ovarian tumour, with some ])eritonitis over it, and pregnancy. On opening the abdomen, tlie tumour was found to be a large rapidly growing soft fibroid, attached to the left side of the uterus by a thin pedicle. TJiis was dealt with in the usual way. The operation offered no difficulty. Immediately after- wards, however, the patient succumbed to old-standing aortic disease. No autopsy was permitted.

Observations on the Bladder during the l^larly Puerperium. I have elsewliei'o discussed siaiie clinical features of the l)ladder during pregnancy, and specially to the pressure exerted on it by parturition. On tlie ])iâ€˜esent occasion I desire to draw attention to some conditions of the bladder during the normal puerperium. During tlie second stage of labour the Idadder is either voluntarily or involuntarily relieved of its contents, so that at the conclusion of the tliird stage tlie organ is usually empty. Immediately succeeding tlie third stage, and during the early puerperium, the bladder exerts an im- portant intiuence on the uterus. This inliuence is mainly oliserved as atlecting the position of the uterus. It is con- venient here to look at the relative positions of bladder and uterus. The bladder has sunk down into the pelvis from the abdomen, and after labour is to lie found, usually empty, lying lielow the brim of the true pelvis, but on a higher level than during pregnancy. For while the liladder, when empty or slightly distended, is spread out below the anterior uterine segment, so that, on introducing a catheter, its distal end and ^ the meatus are on the same level, and in some cases the ' fundus is lower than the meatus, after labour this relation no ) longer exists ; for the inlet of the pelvis becoming free, and f pressure being removed from the bladder, the organ is allowed to expand upwards, so that a catheter goes no longer directly back, but its point is directed upwards, and is consequently ' elevated above the level of the meatus. The uterus, as to position immediately after labour, varies. It is pressed forwards by the action of the abdominal muscles I

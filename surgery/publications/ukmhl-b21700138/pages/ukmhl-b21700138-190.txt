174 CLINICAL PAPERS. of the varieties of eudoiiietritis, there is no proceeding more valuable. Yet in my own practice and in the practice of otliers I have seen very serious mischief result from its use. In no manipulation does the condition of appendages require to ])e more carefully e.xaniined before operation tlian in curetting. AVhere the ovaries or tubes are involved, the use of the curette must be delayed until they are relieved, and if tliat IS impracticable, some other less irritating method must l)e adopted. Let me state the following case as an example — Four years ago I saw a patient with a medical friend. Slie suffered from htemorrhagic endometritis succeeding: abortion. The question of curetting was of course discussed. But as lioth ovaries were tender, and some slight utero-sacral cellu- litis present, I gave a very strong opinion against curetting— urged, at all events, that no uterine operation should be un- dertaken till the appendage condition had been seen to. Aly friend thought otherwise, and curetted. A^iolent pelvic inflammation was set up. IMonths after, I opened a large pelvic aljscess. The patient subsequently died, having Ijeen bed- ridden for a year. Of course it will f>e urged that we can never be absolutely certain of the condition of tlie annexa ; probaljly not, ljut all I maintain is, that we recognise where the element of danger lies, and by patient examination reduce the risk to a minimum. The three following rules are worth attention :— 1. That the diagnosis of all pelvic and most pelvi- alxlominal conditions should be made slowly and gently with tlie unaided liands, and upon the examination tlius made the ])ractitioner should train himself to rely. 2. That no mechanical aids to sight or touch should be employed, except under exceptional circumstances. 3. Tliat as a large proportion of the risks and accidents attendant on minor gymccological operations are due to a want of appreciation, on the part of the physician, of the

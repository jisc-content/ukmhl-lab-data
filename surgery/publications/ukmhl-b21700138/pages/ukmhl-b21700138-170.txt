154 CLINICAL PAPERS. tumour was a large oue, involving a wound nearly from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis. Afterwards she was ap])arently well, without any notable rise of pulse or tempera- ture. On the night of tlie seventh day, after the stitches had been removed, while the nurse had left the patient just for a minute, the patient jumped out of bed, tore oh' the dressing, and before she could be brought back to bed the strapping had given way. This allowed tlie wound to reopen at its lower margin, and a small portion of the gut escaped. I saw her very shortly afterwards, and found her in a state of violent e.vcitenient. It was with difficulty that she was anaesthetised. I was fortunately able to deal with the temporary hernia, and she recovered from the operation, but only to become an inmate of an asylum, where she still is. These cases all illustrate mental disturbances occurring immediately after an operation. Case 8.â€”The next one is a case of melancholia, which supervened six months after the performance of a simple ovariotomy. The case was a perfectly easy one, without any complications. The patient made an excellent recovery, but six months afterwards began to show syni])toms of dislike to her friends, along with evidences of suspicion and melancholy, and she is now, and has been for some time, confined in an asylum. The interesting feature of all tliese cases is, that all those mental disturbances occurred after operations which were un- complicated and simple, and in cases where the operation itcr sc was entirely successful; and, further, that all occurred in women who, so far as could be traced, had no hereditary tendency wliatever in that direction. There is little reason to doubt that sejTic infection lias a great deal to do in the production of insanity after operations. Of course, in looking for causes that lead to these mental disturbances after operation, tlie field is very wide.

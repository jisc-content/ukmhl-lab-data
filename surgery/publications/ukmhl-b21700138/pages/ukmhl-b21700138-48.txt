My previous exi)erience of all forms of metallic clamp had been so unsatisfactory, that indeed, until the three to whicli i now refer, 1 had never had a successful hysterectomy— I mean, of course, by abdominal incision. To the last of the hysterectomies 1 wish to draw special attention. 1. n., ;et. 25, a dwarf, was recommended to me 1)V Dr. Dasil Orr as a suitable case for Ciesarean section, in Februarv 1890. She gave tlie following history:—Slie laid noticed a swelliim’ in her abdomen for the last four months, which was rapidly increasing in size. She had not menstruated since September, seven months ago, but otherwise was in good health. On examination she presented all the usual signs of pregnancy, the uterus l)eing, however, drawn u]t entirely out of the pelvis, which gave the following measurements:— Coiijugata vera . 1^ in.

Of course delivery ].)cr vias naturcdcs was an absolute impossibility; therefore operation was recommended about the middle of the ninth month ; but as some uneasiness and susi)icious labour syjnptoms showed tliemselves at the end of the eiglith mouth, it was thought advisable to ]ierforni opera- tion at tliat time. Tlie question tlien arose as to the nature of operation to be undertaken, and tlie choice lay between Ciesarean section and liysterectomy by I’orro’s method. Caesarean section has given excellent results in Germany, and the remarkable series of successful cases of Dr. Cameron of Glasgow entirelv bear these out. In my case tlie special indications for a Porro- Gicsarean section were not present, namely— 1. When the uterus is the seat of any disease, such as myoma, which if left behind might soon require removal.

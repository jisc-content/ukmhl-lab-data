CAUSATION OF PRIMITIVE FACE CASES. 187 and at the same time affords an explanation of the cause of its occurrence:— Case 1.—Margaret Walker, tet. 30, a multiparous woman, pregnant of her third child, was admitted to the IMaternity Hospital on September 2G, 1879. On examination externally.—There is considerable right uterine obliquity. The globe of the head can be felt above the brim. With the fingers and thumb grasping the abdominal wall just above the pubes, the head can be felt high up above bony ring freely movable. Back of child is directed towards the right. Small foetal parts can be felt towards left side, near fundus. Greatest intensity of foetal heart on right side. Internal examination.—Cervix shortened; os externum gaping ; os internum easily admits forefinger ; membranes nn- ruptured; anterior fontanelle distinctly felt. Position, right occipito-posterior well extended. September 27.—The full face felt, nose, orbits, chin, left mento-anterior. September 28.—Full face felt as before; no uterine contractions are distinguishable. At the patient’s urgent request, she was allowed to go home for a day or two. She returned on October 12. External examination as on Septem- ber 2 G. Internal examination. Presentation, cranial position, a well-extended right occipito-posterior. The anterior fontan- elle is easily felt, but the apex of occipital bone can only be recognised with difficulty to the right, posteriorly and high up. October 13.—The presentation is a full face, high up, freely movable, not in contact with bony pelvis. Slight hardening of the uterus, under the hand externally, can occasionally be felt, but this does not in any way affect position. October 14.—lJuring visit, position right occipito-posterior. Vesper.—Full face presented, without any uterine con- traction being felt by patient or recognised l^y hand.

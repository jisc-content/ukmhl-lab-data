Sir James Paget,^ liowever, points out tliat fibroid tumours found in the pelvis, unattached to the uterus, sometimes are not the result of separation of tlie pedicle and adhesions to neighl)Ouring parts, but are really ])rimarily tumours of the muscular tissue of the round liga- ments, or utero-vesical or utero-sacral folds. 1 have not myself met with any detached uterine filu’oid tumour which had formed connections with surrounding structures, l)ut I have met with one which, attached to the fundus anteriorly by a long pedicle, had prola])sed into the ])ouch of Douglas, and there formed extensive adhesions to the rectum. It was removed witli considerable difficulty, and its removal resulted in a cure of long-standing dysmenorrhoea. Although it scarcely falls within the scope of this i)aper, it seems a suitalJe opportunity to refer to an exceptional relation of the liver and kidney respectively. As both of these cases have already been recorded elsewliere, I merely make a general reference to them now. The first was a case sent to me from Broughty-Ferry, where 1 found a large tumour occupying the whole abdomen, and which 1 could feel, ]>er vaginam, projecting into the pouch of Douglas. It ]>roved to l)c a large sarcoma of the liver. The other cuse was one in wliicli a patient, a multipara, sulfered from extreme ]>elvic and lumlnir pain, and on examination I found a mass Ifigli u]) in the ])Ouch of Douglas, and which 1 con- ceived to be a ])clvic, probably ovarian, tumour. However, on opening the abdomen, it was found to be the lower end of a floating kidney. I liave ventured to record these cases simply because ’ Gaz. d. hop., Paris, 1860, ]). 411. ^ “Surgical Patliology,” p. 110. = Ibid., 1862, p. 77.

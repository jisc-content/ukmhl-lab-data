Opemtive Interference witli Fibroid Tumours during Ib'egnancy, Parturition, ami the Puerperium. It is l)ut seldom—notwithstanding their great frequency among child-beai'ing women—that tibi’oid tumours give rise to any inconvenience during ]>regnancy, and still less frequently do they require any surgical interference. The ordinary history of such tumours in the nonqu'egnant ■condition is well known, and, even in exceptional circumstances, when they am a source of dangei- to the patient, the method of dealing with them by removal of the ovaries, and in some cases by the continuous current, has rendered their entii-e removal a comparatively infretpient operation. The behaviour of fibroid and similar tumours during pregnancy is interesting. In over 400 cases of abdominal section I have only bad to interfere with ovarian tumours four times during ])regnancy, and with fibroids the cases which I now record are all that have come under my notice. The growth of these tumours is often rapid during pregnancy, resulting in interference with the circulation and oedema of the lower extremities. They are a frequent cause of abortion and profuse uterine hicnior- rhage, and often Ijy their bulk cause interference with the functions of bladder and rectum. They often alter the posi- tion of the uterus, and, as a result, abnormal ])resentations of the fmtus and ]n-olapse of the cord are by no means infre- quent. f'urthermore, and specially, abnormality in the uterine contractions is a frequent com])lication of labour, and the expulsion of the fcntus is often unduly prolonged. As in the case about to be recorded, the presence of a m}'oma which obstructs labour is similar to a contracted ])elvis. Pviqiture

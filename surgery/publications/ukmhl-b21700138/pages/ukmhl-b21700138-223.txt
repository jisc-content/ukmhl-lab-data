207 SACCULATED PREGNANT UTERUS. the patient had had irregidar hiemorrhages, and as the tninonr had grown rapidly, I arrived at the concdusion that she was suffering from a sessile ovarian. I accordingly opened lier abdomen, and to my surprise found a pregnant uterus. Before closing the wound I was interested to know the cause of what was obviously a sacculated uterus. The only abnor- mality I could discover was a fibroid tumour in the anterior uterine wall, which, by impinging on the Ijrini of the pelvis, had prevented the lower uterine segment rising. I very gently freed this, and closed the abdomen. Four days after- wards the woman was delivered with the greatest ease, the cervix coming into its proper axis. After the birth of the child the iiterus again became retroverted, and tliere was some difficulty in removing the placenta. Diihrssen records a case of gravid retroflexion, at tlie sixth month, which was associated witli a soft fibroid in the anterior wall. It was partially replaced, and a subsecpient laparotomy was performed, as he mistook tlie lilu'oid for an ovarian tumour. After removal of the fibroid, the woman aborted and recovered. Sperber relates a case of partial retroflexion at the seventli month, there being no foetal parts in the pelvic portion. All the symptoms of incarceration were present at the seventh month, along with well-marked uterine pains, when curiously enough the uterus righted itself, and the pregnancy went on to full term. Case 4.â€”The counterpart of the case I have just narrated, which simulated a sacculated uterus, was under my care in AVard 28, in December 1893. She was sent in by Dr. Smith of Grahamstown. On examination we found a large pelvi-abdominal tumour, reaching as far up as the umbilicus and filling up the vagina completely. Xo cervix could be detected. The tumour filled the whole false as well as true pelvis. On the left side it was hard and nodular, but on the

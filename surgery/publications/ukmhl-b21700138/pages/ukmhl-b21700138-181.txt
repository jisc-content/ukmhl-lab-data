ELEPHANTIASIS ARABUM. 165 area of swelling, and enveloped in a layer of skin and epidermis, which had not, to all appearance, undergone much change. This tissue, on examination, was found to consist of a hyperplasia of the cellular elements of the connective tissue and lymph spaces between, enormously dilated, from which a watery fluid flowed on slightest exijression, and had originally consisted of the deeper layer of the dermis and the subcutaneous connective tissue. No great thickening of the epidermis was noticealde on microscopic examination, but the papilhe were larger than normal and occurred at much wider intervals, whilst in some parts of the substance of the epidermis there were present dilated lympli spaces. Nerve bulbs were awanting in the parts examined. Those portions previously described as being hard and papillomatous consisted for the most part of dense fil)rous tissue covered by a liypertrophied epidermal coating. Cornil and Ifanvier consider elephantiasis of the vulva histologically, under three principal forms:â€” 1. AVhere the entire derma is hypertrophied and assumes embryonic characters, in the midst of which are greatly dilated lymph spaces. 2. That which succeeds repeated oedema and affects wide areas, when there is general stagnation of the lymph system. In this variety, especially, there occurs often a fibrous alteration in the ganglia. 3. Enormous increase in the derma, with proliferation of all its elements, and dilatation with lymph of the intervening spaces. Whether associated with tlie Filaria sanrjuinis, or having its origin from any other cause, in all varieties the constant lesion is a dilatation of the lymph channels, and without doubt this occurred in the case now reported, and prol)ably had its initial causation in the destruction of the lymphatic glands and tiie consequent obstruction of the lymph stream accompanied l)y stagnation and accumulation of lymph.

CLINICAL PAPERS. 50 These were removed, not without very considerable hiemorrhage, and proved to be pieces of degenerated placenta. As in the previous case, some of the villi could be found very much enlargetl and distended. Xo foetus or trace of foetus was found, and at no time was tliere any record of a ftetus having passed ; and as the patient was very careful in her observations, and had no reason to conceal the truth, I feel confident tliat nothing of the nature of a foetus did pass. 1 neeil not further enlarge on this case, except that it is interesting to have pregnancy occurring at 54, and that such a complication is a very rare factor in the production of hamiorrhage so long after what is usually recognised as the fertile period of a womanâ€™s life. Of course the rpiestion naturally arises. How long had this condition lasted ? And, as far as I can discover, the longest duration of a myxomatous gestation is fourteen months; so, therefore, in any case, as the symptoms of luemorrhage had been present for five months, it is more than probable that the duration of the pregnancy had been eight or ten months. Another very interesting feature in this case was, that a week afterwards large pieces of decidua were passed. Evidently the decidua had l>een adherent, had exfoliated, and been expelled. This of course is a very rare coincidence, because usually, in this disease, the chorion and decidua are so adherent that they come away together. To return to the extra-uterine })regnancy we are consider- ing. It would seem, therefore, that the condition of tliis extra-uterine ])lacenta was one analogous to an earlv intra- uterine myxoma. Xo doubt I did not find the gestation sac filled witli tlie usual vesicles, the growth and development of wliich would have caused an early ru])ture; the cause of rupture here was the accumulation of blood from tlie diseased placenta, and this accumulation was slow, and, even wlien

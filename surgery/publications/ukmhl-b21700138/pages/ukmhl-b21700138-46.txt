CLINICAL PAPERS. 3° show tliat, \vitli due care, they are attended witli little danger, and wliat risks do exist are fully compensated l)y the great relief obtained. Of course the diagnosis of gall stones will always l)e difficult, and twice 1 have refused to operate l)ecause I could not satisfy myself of their presence. Cer- tainly the symptoms are very uncertain, and unless the tumour can l>e felt, the diagnosis is doubtful. d. 1 have been obliged to resort to the enucleation of sessile tumours on three occasions. Those tumours have invariably originated in the lu'oad ligament. They offer, perhaps, the greatest difficulty of any set of cases that I have met with. AVhen such a case occurs, after the hand has been carefully passed round the whole site, and the relation of the tumour carefully settled, one of two things can be done. Make an incision in the peritoneum, say, in the middle of the tumour, and set to work to i>eel the ])eritoneuni straight off it, securing any vessels with force])S as the case proceeds. Ultimately, when the base of the tumour is reached, it is simply lifted out, and the bare, bleeding peri- toneum left beneath. The peritoneum is then ligatured bv an ordinary knot at the base, and the redundant })eritoneum removed. This, however, is not uniformly jiossible. Some- times, as in one of my cases, the peritoneal l)ase was so big and broad that it required to be stitched by a whole series of ligatures. In the one case where I was obliged to do this, the ])atient made an excellent recovery; and in one other case, where the ])eritoneum was easily stripped off, easily ligatured, and equally easily removed, the ]»atieut died, the reason being that in the former case the tumour was small, and the shock comparatively slight; whereas in the other case the tumour \\as lualt as big again as an ordinary full-time pregnancy, and had been repeatedly tapped l)efore I saw her, and the shock on removing the fluid and stripping off a large

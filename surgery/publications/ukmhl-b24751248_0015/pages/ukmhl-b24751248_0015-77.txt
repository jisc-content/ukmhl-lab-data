In these experiments a 60-element Pulvermacher's bath battery was employed, (i) On placing the metal conductor upon the skiu of the arm or back of the hand, the burning yensation is unbearable. (2) On placing it on the palm or under surface of the fingers, no pain is ex- perienced. (3) There is a line running down the side of each finger where the painful sensation commences. (4) This line can be detected by the eye, the smooth, papillary slcin being insensible, the hairy, poly- gonally reticulated skin being acutely sensible, (j) The same holds good in respect to the foot.

It was observed that, in the less sensible parts of the skin, the im- pression of heat proceeding from a body not in contact with the surface is occasionally mistaken for the touch of a solid body.

Baumler observed the actions of the intercostal muscles in several persons whose chests were particularly favorable to their inspection, viz., a youth in whom the sternal portion of the pectoralis major was absent, a woman from whom a part of the same muscle had been re- moved with the mamma, and two very emaciated persons, (i) In the

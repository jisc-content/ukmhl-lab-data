Skoda, Sciiiff, Zimmeiimann.—On Fever. Allg. Wien. med. Ztg., 23, i860. Id., 42, 1858. Pr. Ver. Ztg., N. F. ii, 14—40, 1859. Schmidt's Jahrb., vol. 109, p. 220, Skoda believes it to be positively established by clinical observation that fever, in cases of local inflammation, is the primary phenomenon, and therefore cannot be produced by the latter. SchifF insists that febrile heat and congestion are active conditions, the results of the activity of dilating nerves, just as the rigor is of the contracting nerves. His main fact seems to be, that if fever be set up by the injection of irritating matter into the pleural cavity or vessels, the temperature does not rise nearly so high on the side where the sympathetic is divided as on the other. Zimmermann argues to show that there is no such thing as essential fever, that it is always and in all cases the result of local lesion. VooT.—On the employment of Sulphate of Quinine and Veratria in Typhoid Fever. Bullet. Gener. de Therap., May 30th, i860. Br. and For. Med.-Ch. Rev., Jan. Veratria is a powerful antipyretic, and is to be preferred in all febrile diseases which show a rapid and impetuous progress. In typhoid fever it should be employed at the commencement, more particularly when the fever is very acute and the congestion in the head very active. In cases which are more slow in their progress, with a less intense febrile reaction, with hyperemia more dependent on venous stagnation, and in the latter periods of the disease, when adynamia or anaemia predominates, then quinine is preferable.

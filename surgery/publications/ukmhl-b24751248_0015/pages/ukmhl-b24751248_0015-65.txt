I aiiinuil than an intellectual life, we care uothiiig for aud do not require auy sort of alcoholic liquor; whereas, when engaged iu our profes«iouB or "business in Loudon, iii the midst of bad air, noise, hurry, bustle, competition, and excitement, we are conscious of au iiumistakeable craving for a certain amount of alcohol with our daily food ; the reason being that, in the one case, we are doing everything to refresh and fortity, and in the other to exhaust and wear out, the nervous system. This "fact goes far to prove that alcohol, in some peculiar but as yet \mexplained way, does repair nervous tissue. TitoirpsoN, Dr. E SriiES.—On the Influence of Ozonized Cod-liver Oil on the Pulse. Med. Times and G-az., March 9th, p. 266. The author found that the influence of the oil on the pulse increased in proportion to the dose in which it was given, the etfect of half-ounce doses, two or three times a day, being more marked than that of smaller quantities. The following table exhibits, as simply and concisely as possible, the results: Tahle showing the Ohantjes of Pvlse imde^' Ozonized Cod-liver Oil. Xanic. J. P J. s. AV. B. M. H. E. A. AV. C. H. K. N.

He had made use of the ozonized water (as prepared by Condy), and found its influence in retarding the pulse considerable, 'in reference to a belief still prevalent amongst some members of the profession, that ozone was a high oxide of hydrogen, the author remarks that he had used the peroxide of hydrogen (prepared by Messrs.

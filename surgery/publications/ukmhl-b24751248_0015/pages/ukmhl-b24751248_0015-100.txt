Davis, Prof. (Chicago).—On the injluence of Prer/nancif on the quality of the Milk of the Human Female. Clin'. Med. Exam,, Oct i860. Trom several analyses Davis infers that the occurrence of pregnancy during the ordinary period of lactation either speedily reduces the quantity of milk secreted or lessens tlio proportion of solid or nutritive constituents to such a degree as to render it insufficient for the proper nourishment of a cliild over six months old. In a small proportion of cases, however, the milk secreted continues abundant and of good quality, but the health of the mother rapidly declines, while in a still smaller proportion of cases the mother and child both continue well nourished and healthy.

BONES. 263 Senftleben recommencls the applicatiou of the hot iron to the condensed bone after removing sequestra, iu order, if possible, to destroy it as far as the vascular layers, and render granulation possible. The differ- ence between total and partial necrosis is said to depend essentially on the intensity of and the rapidity of the preceding inflammation of the bone and periosteum; and the extent of the necrosis, as regards the peripheral layers of a bone, to depend on how far the vessels piercing the bone from the periosteum have remained uninjured. The locali- zation of partial necrosis " depends principally on the histological pro- perties of the periosteum in different situations." The cortical layer of bone has a coA^ering of three kinds :—(i) Perios- teum. (2) Pasicse and tendons at the processes and crests, the smaller vascularity of which predisposes to suppuration and death, in conse- quence of which the hard, bony tissue becomes bathed in pus. The causes of inflammation of these tendinous and periosteal structui'es are rheumatism, scrofula, syphilis, and violence. The diagnosis and removal of sequestra in the neighbourhood of joints have their difficulties; the joints themselves are often involved, but recover after removal of the source of irritation. In suppuration of a joint, consequent on necrosis of a portion of one of the articular surfaces forming it, extraction of sequestrum may often replace complete excision of the joint.

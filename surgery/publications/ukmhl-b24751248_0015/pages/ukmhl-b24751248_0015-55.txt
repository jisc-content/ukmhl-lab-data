FOOD, MEDICINE, AND I'OISOK. 47 i The author insists upon the opposition in tho deportment of a muscle and that of the electric organ of the torpedo, after excitation. If two pieces of the electric organ be opposed, and the nerve of one piece be excited to several discharges, it v?ill be found on recomposing the pile with the two opposed portions that there exists a strong differ- ential current in the direction of that portion which gave the discharge. The author thei-efore concludes that the electro-motor power of muscle depends on the chemical actions that preside over muscular irri- tability, and which are wealcened with contraction, whilst that of the electric organ is sustained by nervous action, as might happen if such action gave rise in each cell to the secretion of materials capable of chemical reaction.

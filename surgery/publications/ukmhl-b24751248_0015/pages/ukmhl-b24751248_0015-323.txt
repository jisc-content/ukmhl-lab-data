Archiv fiir Chir., vol. i, part 2, p. 357. Berlin, 1S61. The deep situation of the atheromatous cysts of the neck, and their frequent connexion with the sheath of the large vessels, led the author to suspect some other than a tegumentary origin ; and the discovery of a structure identical with that of lympliatic glauds in the walls of an atheromatous cyst which had been removed from the neck by Professor Langenbeck ('Archiv f. Chir.,' yol. i, part i, p. 16) has conx-inced him of the glandular origin of those atheromatous cysts in the neck which are developed m the neighbourhood of the great vessels.

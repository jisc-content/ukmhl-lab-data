In his experiments with dogs, Ilanimoud determined that urea in small amount was normally present in their blood, and ammonia in their breath. If a solution of urea was injected, symptoms of iiricmiawere soon apparent, severe in proportion to the amount injected, but the amount of ammonia in the blood was not increased. If the renal vessels were tied the amount of urea in the blood was increased threefold in a short time, and there was no evidence of any of it having been converted into carbonate of ammonia. As long, however, as vomiting and purging continued, the urea did not accumulate in the blood, and there was no intoxication. Congestion and inflammation of important viscera occurred, especially of the lungs, pericardium, and spleen. Injection of urine into the blood produced death more rapidly tiian injection of urea alone. Moss, W.—On the action of Potash, Soda, Lithia, Lead, Opium, and Colchicum, on the Urine. Amer.

Arch. d. Heillc, ii, i, 1861. Schmidt's Jahrb., vol. no, p. 164. Weikart has experimented with various sahs, to discover the relative facility with which each passes through an animal membrane under a constant pressure, which was made as nearly as possible equal to that of the blood. The result was that the carbonates of soda and potash much surpassed all others in their percolating power. The amount of distilled water which passed through being taken as 100, a 2 per cent, solution of Pot. Carb. gave 99-69, and of Sod. Carb. 88-42 parts ; a4 per cent., 75-16 and 76-31 parts. If the pressure was augmented, the fluid permeated the membrane more rapidly. Weikart infers from the above result that the alkaline carbonates are the most eftcctive of all the saline diuretics, and that the vegetable salts of the alkalies only act as diuretics by becoming converted into carbonates. He believes digitalis to produce diuresis by its power of increasing the force of the heart's action, and consequently the amount of pressure on the walls of the capillaries. Clanis, reporting on the above experiments, deems it necessary to take

The least evacuation occurred on tlie Saturday (which was also u treadwheel-day), and the diuiiiiulion froiu the weight of all days was 26-1, 57-6 and 34-6 per cent., and from that on (Sundays no less than 48, 75, and 62 per cent. 5. The proportion of w^atcr contained in the fseces was very uniform from day to day, viz., 73-5 per cent., and varied only from 71'8 to 77-6 per cent, on dilfereut days. It was above the average ou Sundays and a little below the average ou treadwheel-days. 6. The quantity of nitrogen in each ounce of fresh fpcces varied from 4-36 to 4-9 grains, and was, on the average, 4-646 grains. The total daily quantity thus evacuated was, on the average, no less than 41-8 grains. There was a considerable increase on the Sunday, and a marked decrease on the Saturday, and it was below the average on treadwlieel- days, and in both of these respects it corresponded with the gross weight of the faeces. The actual amounts under the three conditions Avere 59*9, 35'8 and 40-53 grains, giving an increase of 43-3 per cent, and a decrease of i4'3 and 3 per cent. There was a very interesting fact noticed iu reference to the relation of nitrogen in the m-iue and fajces on the Sunday, and which showed, probably, that the assimilation of food was lessened ou a day of perfect rest foliowiug one of hard labour, viz., that the iuci'ease which was observed iu the nitrogen iu the fnsces on the Sunday corresponded accurately with the decrease observed in the lu'ine ou that day, viz., a decrease of 13 and 18 grains of urea in the urine, and an increase of uitrogeu, reckoned as urea, in the fa;ces, of 71-33 grains. 7. The case wliich had the extra allowance of 6| oz. of bread daily evacuated the largest amount of ftcces, both ou the total average and ou Suudays, a fact of great significance iu reference to the kind of food Avhich should be selected for extra diets. In similar inquiries made at Wakefield Gaol by E. Smith and W. E. Milner the geuei-al character of the fasces was homogeneous and moderately cohesive, but ou a few occasions there was a variety in the consistence. In the 52 observations, 32 exhibitedfseccs formed, but soon subsiding, 7 well-formed, i scybalous, 2 soft, and 9 of mixed character, and no one person ofl!"ered any raai-ked diftereuce iu those characters. The bran of the brown bread was easily seen iu the faeces. The average daily evacua- tion was 6-98 oz. iu the tailors, and 8 52 oz. in the weavers, giving a total dail}^ average of 7-75 oz. There were somewhat considerable daily variations, so that the maximum and minimum quantities were in the tailors, regarding separately, 11-41 oz. and 4-32 oz., and in the weavers, i4'42 oz. aud 1-72 oz., but in no instance was there the omission of a daily evacuation. The quantity of uitrogeu per cent, found by Mr. Man- ning by the volumetric method varied from -71 grs. to i-i6 grs. in tlie tailors, and from -97 grs. to 1-35 grs. in the weavers ; but the total aver- age iu the two classes was -93 in the tailors, and i'i2 in the weavers, giving I'025 grs. in the whole. The total daily elimination of nitrogen by the fscces was found to be 27-43 grs. iu the tailors, aud 4Â°'93 gi's-

The author relates three cases as examples of an affection not, as far as he knows, particularly described in books. The chief symptoms are —in- continence of urine or frequent desire to pass water ; much irritation along the urethra and pain, the orifice and canal of the urethra red, con- gested and tender. Alteratives, rest, astringent injections, and the use of the catheter, were found successful in removing the affection. Curling, T.

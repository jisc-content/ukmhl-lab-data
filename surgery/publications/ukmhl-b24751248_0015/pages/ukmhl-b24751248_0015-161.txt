SiEVEKiXG.—Clinical RetnarTcs on Neuralgia. Lancet, Jan. 12th, 19th, 26th ; Feb. 2nd, 9th, Sieveking remarks that neuralgia is essentially a disease of middle life, prevailing most in the fourth decennial period. Out of sixty-five cases thirty were males. He gives several cases illustrating the usual modes of treatment. Bedford Bkown.—Effect of Chloroform on the Cerebral Circulation. Amer. Journ. of Med. Sc., Oct,, i860. Brit. Med. Journ., Jan. 5th. Brown found, during the inhalation of chloroform, the exposed brain of a boy, ret. 10, to become anaemic and shrunken, while previously it had been florid, injected, and bulging. D YCE Duckworth.—Observations on the Physiological Action ofAconitina. Brit. Med. Journ., March 2nd. Duckworth considers that, as a rule, the pupil is more or less contracted, dilating enormously a few moments before and at the time of death. The mode of death, wlien a large dose is given, is either by direct cardiac syncope or by a powerfully sedative impression on the nervous system, the nction of the heart ceasing, and no convulsions taking place. With smaller doses the heart's action is gradually enfeebled, ancUhe pulmonary and systemic circulation go on very slowly, while the respiration becomes slow and the venous system engorged.

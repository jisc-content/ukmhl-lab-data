FoRSTER, Trot—Death of a Fcetusfrom penetration of the Vernix Oaseosa and Meconium into the Pulmonary Vesicles. Wiirzb. Med. Zt., vol. i, p. 216. Med. Times and Gaz., Aug. 3, 1861. The child, well developed, died after making a few feeble inspiratory efforts. The brain was very hypersemic, the lungs sank in water, and in many parts contained meconium and vernix caseosa. The question of the manner in which these matters got into the lungs is discussed by the author, who concludes that the hyperaemic condition of the brain excited in- spiratory efforts prior to birth, or that during the passage of the head through the vagina, inspiratory movements occurred. Panthel.—Injury to the Foetus inutero. Nass. Med. Jahrb., xv and xvi, p. 733. Schmidt, vol. 112, p. ,53. A woman received a blow on the abdomen in the seventh month of pregnancy. Some days after, labour set in, presentation pelvic, birth of a foetus which had been dead some days. On the upper part of the head was a tumour 3—4" wide precisely like that known as the "cranial blood- swelling," having a border of hardened material. It contained liquid blood which at the borders of the tumour had become clotted. The connection between the blow, the death and the production of the swelling as cause and effects appeared to be substantiated. Bartscher.—Strangulation of the Foetus by knotting of the Cord.

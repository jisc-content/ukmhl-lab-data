A Yeaii-Book for 1862 will be published as early as possible in next year. It has been decided that, in future, in order to obtain space for longer abstracts of the more valuable papers, greater liberty of selection shall be entrusted to the editors, and that lists of titles only shall be for the most part omitted. The section devoted to Physiology, &c., will be considerably shortened, in order to give greater length to those on Medicine, Sui-gery, and Midwifery. Arrangements have also been made under which the index will occupy less room. The size of the volume will be, as heretofore, about 500 pages. These alterations have been determined on by the Council, in con- formity with the wishes of a large body of the members of the New Sydenham Society, and it is expected that they will be found materially to increase the practical value of the work. The present volume comprises abstracts of 1459 ^^orks or papers; and gives the titles (with references) of 1368 others, abstracts of which are excluded for want of space.

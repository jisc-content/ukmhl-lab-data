Bruns groups the cases of this kind which had occurred in his klinik under two heads—(i) Badly united fractures. (2) Palse joints. The greater number of badly united fractures happened in very young children, which is attributable to the greater difficulty of diagnosis aud efficient treatment at this early age. He holds the fundamental rule, never to propose interference unless the probable advantages out- weigh the difficulty and danger of the operation, which consists in breaking the bone in the situation of the fracture, and maintaining it in the correct position. Palse joints are most successfully treated by subcutaneous tearing asunder the new bond of union, and roughly working the ends of the bones against each other. In one case Bruns followed Dieffenbeck's plan of drilling and pegging the ends of the bone, but unsuccessfully; and in four cases he resected the extremities, one only of which terminated satisfactorily.

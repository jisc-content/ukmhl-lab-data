This communication is in continuation of the author's previous inquiries (see 'Year-Book,' vol. ii, p. 67). He finds—(i) that if the temperature of the air be raised, it hastens the occurrence of the gradual retardation and final cessation of the heart's action, observed to occur in frogs poisoned by woorara. (2) The poison acts only through the blood, for if it be administered after complete interception of the cir- culation in the leg of a frog, irritation, either of the poisoned or un- poisoned surface, excites contractions in the corresponding foot—con- tractions which may be elicited during six or eight hours, imless the event be hastened by elevation of temperature. (3) Direct application of a solution of the posion to the spinal cord, after ligature of the heart, is shortly followed by tetanic spasms on every attempt at voluntary movement.

These inquirers state that, in poisoning by woorara, (i) there is always a stage of increased reflex irritability; (2) reflex movements may be elicited after the abolition of direct irritability; (3) the heart's beats increase in frequency; and now (4) tetanic excitement of the vagus does not arrest, but accelerates, the pulse, and this in proportion to the strength of the current.

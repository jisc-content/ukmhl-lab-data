Jahrb., vol. iii, Lefevre adduces evidence to show that the colic so frequent on board men-of-war, and especially steamers in the tropics, is the result of lead poisoning. Lead is found in the drinking-water, and in many cases there is a blue line on the gums. Chapuis.—Observations on the Cases of Dry Colic which have occurred in the Hospitals of French Guyana. Gaz. Hebdom., No. 36. Canst. Jahrb., vol. iii, p. 31. Chapuis shows that this disorder occurs more frequently in some places, when there is no possibility of lead poisoning, thau in others, where lead is used for water-pipes, &c. It alternates with hemicrania and other neuroses, and is cured by leaving the country. Sentek, L.—Treatment of Neuralgia by Cauterization with SO3. J. de Boru., May, 1861.

The period of the disorder coincided with that of intermittent fever, both being most prevalent in June and November. Shivering, weariness, and a sense of discomfox-t, were commonly the precursors of the attack. These symptoms increased sometimes even to syncope and a sense of annihila- tion at the time of the paroxysm. In two interesting cases a deep sopor replaced the cardialgic paroxysm. PSYCHIATRIK.

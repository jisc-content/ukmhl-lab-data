133 GENERAL SYSTEM. BuiiY, G. W. F.—A Statistical Account of 476 cases of Acute Rheuma- tism admitted into the wards of Middlesex Hospital during the years 1853-59. Brit, and For. Med.-Chir. Rev., July, 1861. Of 256 males, 46 had some form of recent heart affection ; of 220 females, 83 only escaped without heart complication. Pericarditis at- tacked 13 males and 22 females; endocarditis 56 males and 82 females; cndo-pericarditis 42 males and 29 females ; endo-pericarditis with pleurisy 5 males and 4 females. In 67 cases, of the whole number an hereditary tendency was apparent, much more often derived from the father than from tlie mother. With regard to age, 227 of the cases occurred in the decade 15—25 ; and 354 in the period from jo to 30 years. The greatest per-centage of cardiac attacks (68'5) occurred between the ages of 15 and 20, the next below the age of 10 years, the next between 10 and 15 years, the next between 20 and 25, after which the ratio decreases rapidly. The upper extremities were affected alone in 51 cases, the lower in 102, both in 323. The disease shows a marked tendency to commence in the feet and travel upwards. The date of the supervention of heart compli- cation was observed in 103 cases ; in three it commenced as early as the second, and in one as late as the twenty-seventh day. In only 30 cases was the commencement of the attack later than the thirteenth. Previous attacks had occun-ed in 207 cases. As regards the season of the year, the fewest admissions occurred in February (23), the highest in June (65), in October 56, in December 47, and generally the total in the warmer six months exceeded by ten the total of the colder half year. Aran.—On unusual Forms of Rheumatism, and the Remedies to he em- ploijed in them. J. de Med. et de Chir. pratiq. Ann. par Jamain, 1861, p.38. Aran records a case of mild rheumatism, proving suddenly fatal, with no other structural change than a moderate congestion of the lungs. He is inclined to believe that the quinine treatment of rheumatism has rendered unusual forms of the disease more frequent than formerly. In such instances (cerebral or thoracic attacks) he advises the free use of C.C. to the neck or chest, sinapisms to the lower limbs, and of Mayor's hammer (iron heated by Ijoiling water). O'DoNOVAN, R. W.—Observations on the Treatment of Bheumatic Fever. Dublin Quart. Jour, of Med. Sc., Aug., 1861. O'Donovan relates five cases, in two of which opium was of great ser- vice, while in the others it was injurious, and Pot. lod. or lemon juice was found beneficial. O'Donovan indicates a temperament marked by a sallow complexion, dark areolee round the eyes, bushy brows, and heavy eyelids and constipated habit of body, as 'unfavorable to the use of opium. Inman, T.—O/i Sovr-smelling Perspiration in Rheumatism, and its sif/ni- ficance as a Symptom. Lond. Med. Rev., June, 1861 Inman distrusting the theory that the disease results from lactic acid in the blood, argues that the sour smell proceeds from decomposition of the perspiration, and that it ceases when the liuen is frequently changed. 10

329 DENTAL AND AUEAL SURGERY. DENTAL SURGERY. Vasey, C.—0)1 the supposed Influence of the Cementum in sustainvng the vitality of transplanted Teeth. Lancet, June 8th, p. 557. The author refers at some length to John Hunter's experiments of transplanting human teeth into the combs of cocks, and to Owen's account of the structure of the cementum in growing teeth. He is convinced that successful transplantation depends on the presence of two formative organs—the internal or dental pulp, and the external or cemental pulp ; and that in all cases where these are not present, or in which ossification is nearly complete, successful results are not to be anticipated. He thinks that, were the cementum able to support the vitality of a tooth, necrosis would not so frequently follow a slight injury, and shows that a change of position may be slowly effected by continuous traction, without the tooth perishing.

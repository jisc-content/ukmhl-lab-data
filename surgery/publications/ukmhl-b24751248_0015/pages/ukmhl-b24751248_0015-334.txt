Lancet, July 19th, p. 55. The author thinks that the true position of iridectomy has not yet been determined. He punctures the sclerotic coat with the point of a sharp, thin knife, not less than one eighth of an inch behind its junction with the cornea, and carries it on to about the same extent through the cornea, making altogether an incision about one third of an inch long. The outer margin of the iris is divided. Sometimes the iris bulges through the section. The result in about twenty cases was in favour of this operation. WoEDSWORTH, J.

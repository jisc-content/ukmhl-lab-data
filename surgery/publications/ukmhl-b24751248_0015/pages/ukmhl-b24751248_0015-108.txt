UEl'OUT ON THE INSTITUTES OF MEDICINE, 100 gaol, much of the fat is lost, and the fluid contained in the tissues is reduced to a nuiiimuni quantity. The analysis for urea was made by Liebig's method. Lawson, Robeut (Dep. Insp.-Gren. Hosp.)—Some Observations on the Urinari/ and Alvine Excretions, as they appear tvithin the Tropics. Med.-Chir. Ecv., Oct., p. 48.3. Lawson found—(i) that when the quantity of vapour in the atmosphere is great, the amount of solids as well as of water excreted is increased. (2) Moderate exercise diminishes the quantity of urinary fluids and solids, while it increases the action of the skin and lungs. (3) Ilippuric acid is a normal constituent of the urine of Europeans as well as of the blacks inhabiting Jamaica. (4) The urohtematin excreted by the urine appears to be increased in the tropics. Bamberger, Prof. H.—Is Ammonia a Normal Constituent of the Urine? "Wiirzb. Med. Zeitschr., vol. i, p. 146. Canst., vol. i, p. 253. In order to answer this question the author boiled normal urine in a distilling apparatus, and variously tested the vapour for ammonia. In none of a series of experiments could he detect so much as a trace. In Bright's disease, unaccompanied by urajraic symptoms, the albuminous urine, when distilled, distinctly yields ammonia, as does also normal urine to which white of egg has been added.

Liicke states that i)roportionaliy small quantities of cranberries or blackberries greatly increase tlie amount of hippuric ncid in the urine, and impart their respective colours to it.

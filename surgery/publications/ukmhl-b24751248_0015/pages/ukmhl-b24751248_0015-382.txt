874 BEPORT ON MIDWIFERY, ETC, died. The precautions to be taken in performing the operation are next enumerated, and great importance is attached to tlieir due observance. Clay, Dr. Charles.—Ovariotomij and its Results. Lond. Med. Rev., Aug., 1861, p. 157, and Nov. p. 201;. The author here gives a retrospect of liis operations from 1842 to the present time. Respecting the question as to the propriety of tlie opera- tion, he believes that, with the single exception of cases where a single large cyst is present—which he would treat by tapping and iodine injec- tion—all other methods than that of ovariotomy are futile, and some of them dangerous. The etiology and the pathology of ovarian cystic disease are next discussed, and the differential diagnosis of ovarian from other tumours pointed out. The whole number of cases operated on by Dr. Clay was 104; of these, 97 were under his treatment throughout, the others not so entirely. The deaths were 32, the recoveries 72. Alto- gether, the author thinks we cannot reasonably hope to extend our success beyond 70 per cent. Brown, Baker.—Five cases of Ovariotormj. Obst. Trans., vol. iii. Of the five cases one had died, one was cured. The other three cases were doing well. Brown, Baker.—Ovariotomy. Lancet, April 6tb, 1861, p. 343. Four cases of ovariotomy are related, in three of which recovery took place. Brown, Baker.—Seven examples of Ovarian Tumour in which Ova- riotomywas successful. Lancet, Nov. 20th, 1861, p. 521. The success obtained is considered to be to some extent dependent on the course of preparatory treatment here carried out, consisting of warm baths twice a week for three weeks prior to operative measures, and the administration of the tincture of arnica and muriated tincture of iron during the same period, with attention to the general health.

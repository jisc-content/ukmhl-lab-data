87 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. stoues were formed by a process allied to putrefaction, wlipreby an acid state of the b.le was produced. Human gail-stouas usually contain, in addition, a large quantity of cholesterine crystallised around tlie true biliary calculi. The author described, from his own observation, the process of the putrefaction of bile, and agreed generally with Gorup Eesanez, but diflered from him in considering tiiat the choloidie acid resulted from a metamorphosis of the cholic, and not the cholic from a metamorphosis of the choloidie acid. CouviSAiiT, L.—On the Influence of Gastric Digestion on the Functional Activity of the Pancreas. Comp. rend., March 4th, i85i, p. 385. This experimental physiologist teaches that the amount of the pan- creatic ferment secreted keeps pace witli the activity of gastric diges- tion, to which it is subordinate, and to which it is related as effect to cause. But which element of the complex process of digestion is ita veritable and necessary cause ? The author refers it to the formation of the gastric peptones. The quantity and activity of the secretion of the pancreatic ferment depend, up to a certain point, on the quantity of absorbed peptones. At least, there seems to be a constant relation between the rate of its formation and that of the formation and ab- sorption of the peptones. It is, however, a remarkable fact that the intestinal peptones are impotent in provoking the formation of the pan- creatic ferment; and it is also noteworthy that even the gastric peptones, if absorbed solely by the intestines, are equally powerless in exciting the secretion. The author concludes by saying that these facts give origin to a new theory of secretion, entirely different from those founded on the power of nervous excitation or on vascular dilatation.

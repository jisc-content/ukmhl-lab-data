Journ., May, Aug., Dec. Thomson has formed the opinion that prisoners, as a class, have intel- lects much below the average, and that a large proportion are congenitally of imbecile mind. Fully 12 per cent, of the inmates of the General Pi-ison for Scotland during a period of ten years were reported for various degrees of mental weakness, while the deaths from decay from insanity, paralysis, suicide, brain disease, and gradual decay of mind and body, amounted to nearly one third of the whole. Compared with the civil population, the ratio of insanity among criminals is high (^ij- : -^^g). Homicidal patients, though apparently recovered, can never be safely discharged. Meyer, L.—On Opium in Mental Diseases. Allg. Ztschr. f. Psychiatric, xvii, 4, i860. Schmidt's Jahrb., vol. 109, p. 81. Meyer has endeavoured to obtain indications for the administration of opium from the experience of whole populations who resort tait habitually. His conclusion is that opium is especially useful in those forms of reflex insanity which, in the development and final grouping of their pheno- mena, are naturally referable to a primary neurosis of the sexual organs, i. e. in hysterical insanity. He begins with a dose of gr. ij repeated 2dis horis ad vices iv, then intermits its use for 6—12 hours, and resumes it again at the same rate, if necessary. In more chronic cases he gives gr. i—iij every night an hour before going to bed. If opium causes anorexia, furred tongue, and constipation, it is to be omitted.

830 REPORT ON SURGERY. ToTNBEB, J.— Sebaceous Tumours in the External Auditory Meatusi their effects upon the organ of hearing, the petrous hone, and brain, ivith suggestions as to their treatment. Med.-Chir. Trans., vol. xliv, According to the author's investigations, these tumours are not con- nected with the hair-follicles, and occur most frequently in the inner- most part of the meatus. They cause absorption of the bone, and vary in size from a millet-seed to a hazel-nut. They commonly attain a large size without causing pain, and often the attention of the surgeon is first called to them on account of the deafness produced by occlusion of the meatus, or in consequence of fetid discharge, or symptoms of cerebral irritation which too often end in death. Pressure with a probe ■will readily distinguish them from osseous growths, for which alone they are likely to be mistaken. The proper treatment consists in their complete extirpation. Particulars are given of several cases of these tumours, and the post-mortem appearances are illustrated by drawings. Semeleder.—Catheterism of the Eustachian Tube, and RMnoscopi/- Oesterr. Zeitschrift f. prakt. Heilk., No. 21, i86o.| \ Canstatt's Jahrb., vol. iii, p. 117. Semeleder says that the introduction of a catheter into the trumpet- orifice of the Eustachian tube has its difficulties, and that the instrument often gets astray into Eosenmullei''s pit; this may now be avoided by using the rhiuoscope, a reflecting apparatus with which the operator illuminates the pharynx and sees what he ia doing. 9

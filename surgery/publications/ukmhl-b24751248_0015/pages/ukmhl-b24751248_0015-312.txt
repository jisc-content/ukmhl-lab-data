This was a tumour, the size of a hen's egg, growing from the back of the rectum above the internal sphincter. Demarquay, by a semi- circular incision, detached the sphincter from the coccyx, and cut ofl' the back of the rectum with the tumour, which he pulled down witli a forceps. The bowel was then stitched to the skin, in order to avoid infiltration of the surrounding tissues by the faeces. Notwithstanding that several arteries were tied, so much blood was lost during the day that plugging was necessary. The patient died of exhaustion the second day.

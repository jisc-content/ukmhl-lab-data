The detention in prisons lessens tho power of assimilating food- and hence it is quite possible that a quantity of food which would sustain a man out of gaol would not sustain him with the same labour in s^aol. ^ . . . - . • /-< n Urinary xcater.—la the first set of inquiries four prisoners in Cold- bath Fields Prison were selected, who had been some time in prison, and who worked the tread wheel on three days in each week. The quantity of urinary water evolved was, on the total average, 10-4 per cent, greater on tread wheel than on other days. The quantity of fluid drank was the same on each day, but the amount lost by perspiration was much greater on treadwheel-days. , , , j In the experiments at Wakefield, four men of regular habits and m good state of health were selected. Two were weavers of cocoa matting, which is a very laborious occupation, and two were tailors. The largest quantities which were evolved iu one day was 25,321 grs. (56-6 ozs.) and 26,6a4grs. (59-17 ozs.) in the tailors, and 27,791 grs. (62-3 ozs.) and 32,924 grs. (74 ozs.) in the weavers. The average daily quantity was 41-2 ozs. in the tailors, and 47*51 ozs. in the weavers. The average decrease from the Saturday to the Sunday was io'29 ozs. Specific gravity.—The specific gravity of the urine varied from 1016 to 1027-5, but there was singular uniformity in the general results. In the tailors it was 1023-7 ^""^ 10^5. "'^ weavers 1024-37 and I024'6, giving a total average of 1024-35 in the tailors and 1024-45 i'^ weavers. Weight of lody.—The average weight of three of the prisoners during the inquiry was greater than that recorded on the day preceding the com- mencement of the inquiry, but there was a loss of weight in the four. The average gain was, in the tailors, 15-^ ozs. and I7f ozs., and in one of the weavers 3^ ozs., but in the other weaver there was a loss of 3^ ozs. The greatest gain in the different cases was i lb. 134 ozs. and i lb. 71 ozs. in the tailors, and 8| ozs. and i lb. 11 ozs. in the weavers ; and the greatest loss i:^ oz. in one tailor, i lb. 2j ozs. and 4^ ozs. in the weavers. There was no unvarying progression in the weight during the week, but in every case there was an increase from the Saturday to the Sunday. Urea.—At Coldbath Fields the total daily excretion of urea was least oil Sunday, greater on the days of light labour, and greatest on days of treadwheel-labour, on which occasions the average quantities were 494, 512, and 528 grains, giving a daily increase on treadwheel-days of 16 grains over that of days of light labour, and of 34 grains over that of perfect rest. The quantity of urea to each pound of body-weight, both on days of treadwheel-labour and on those of rest, was much above that found in the ordinary conditions of life, viz., from 4*39 grs. to 4-74 grs., or an average of 4-58 grs. to each lb. of body-weight. Smith found in himself, with about the same food, but with much greater weight of body, an average proportion of only 2-75 grains to each lb. The probable expla- nation is that already referred to, viz., that the nitrogenous tissues in the bodies of prisoners, after a certain term of imprisonment, bear a larger proportion to the weight of the whole body than is found in health upder ordinary conditions, since, by the labour and discipline of the

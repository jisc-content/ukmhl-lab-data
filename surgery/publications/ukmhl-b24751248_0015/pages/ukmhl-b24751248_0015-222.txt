Guy's Hosp, Reports, vol. vii, 1861. A male, set. 33, was kept under close observation from February ist to March 23rd, and his urine examined at intervals of four hours. He had all the time Opii gr. j, ter die, brandy and soda water, with water ad libitum. His diet at first was the ordinary fulj mixed. Under this the quantity of sugar passed was 10,573 grains, that of the urine 259 oz., of sp. gr., 1037. About a week later when his diet was purely animal, he passed 127 oz. of urine, sp. gr. 1030, containing 2471 grains of sugar. On a diet of fish and beef tea the amount of urine was 163 oz., and that of th*sugar 1696 grains. With Oij of jelly, two chops, and Oij of beef tea, the amount of urine was 108 oz., of sugar 569 grains. During five days Oiij of milk were substituted for the beef tea; the patient did not feel so well, and the amount of sugar rose to 2225 grains the last day. With 8 oz. of suet, three chops, and Oiij of beef tea, the quantity of sugar was 886 grains, of urine 103 oz. With bran biscuits, meat, and beef tea, sugar 3291 grains, urine no oz. Sj^mptoms worse. After he had again im- proved on a purely meat diet, gluten bread was given with meat and beef tea—sugar 4539 grains, urine 173 oz. Rice, potatoes, and arrowroot, all increased the sugar pretty equally, but not so much as ordinary bread, ■which raised the figure to 3521 grains. With 2 lbs. of carrots the amount of sugar was 2,371 grains. Being now kept solely on animal foot, a trial was made of large doses of phosphoric acid, carbonate of soda, and tartrate of potash and soda. None of these had any marked efi'ect. He was discharged at the end of four months, looking and feeling perfectly well, the quantity of sugar in the urine varying from 959 to about 1127

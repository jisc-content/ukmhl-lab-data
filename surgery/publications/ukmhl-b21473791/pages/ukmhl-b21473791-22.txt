12 sirable improvements were supported by the senior members â€” men who were in the actual enjoyment of the advantages which the system of apprenticeship af- fords ; while those who opposed the pro- jected alteration in our charter, could only have held them in prospectu, and most of these unlikely, from the want of hospitals, ever to have enjoyed them. But, gentle- men, I trust that this degraded state of a liberal profession, requiring for its practice an expanded mind and extensive inform- ation, and allowed to be one of the most useful and honourable which falls to the lot of any body of men to exercise, cannot, whatever be the opposition excited by in- terested and mercenary motives, much longer continue to be debased to a level with the mere mechanical arts. I appeal to my young hearers, who in the course of a very few years will have a voice in the affairs of the college. Will they, from the sordid prospect of the chance of putting a few additional pounds in their pockets, perpetuate this degradation of themselves and their profession ? Is there one of you.

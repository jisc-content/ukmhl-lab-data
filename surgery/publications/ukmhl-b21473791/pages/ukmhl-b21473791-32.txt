22 is proved by experiment, accident, and disease. If the nerves going to certain muscles are divided or injured, the brain loses its influ- ence over these muscles. If the brain be compressed, as occurs in violent injuries to the head, or in apoplexy, it loses its powers of affecting the voluntary muscles; while the involuntary, as we shall presently see, are independent of the will for the most obvious reasons, and continue to perform their functions long after all voluntary movements have ceased. The involuntary muscles, such as the muscular coats "of the stomach and intes- tines, and all the organs subservient to digestion, circulation, respiration, and the secretions, whose actions are necessarily incessant, and therefore ought to be inde- pendent of the will, are supplied by nerves which proceed from ganglions, or peculiar expansions of the nervous substance. These nerves, from their functions, are termed the nerves of organic or vegetative

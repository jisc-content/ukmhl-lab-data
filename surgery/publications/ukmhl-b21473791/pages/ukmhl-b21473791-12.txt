2 you warmlj and sincerely for the kind and affectionate interest you took in my re- covery; and, now, at the earliest day at which I feel myself adequate to the task, I come to redeem my pledge to you and to the public. My colleague, Doctor M'Dowell, by a strange copartnership in misfortune, was, at the same moment, also rendered in- capable of contributing his valuable assist- ance, by a similar, but, I am happy to say, a slighter attack of fever : so that nothing could be more inauspicious than the com- mencement of our school. Mr. Adams, however, stood in the breach : the school was opened at the time announced; and notwithstanding the disadvantages we en- countered, we feel ourselves already sup- ported to an extent which few recent establishments can boast. We are now about to enter upon the surgical part of the course, and I shall take this oppor- tunity of enforcing the several topics which have for some time occupied my mind, and which 1 think most worthy of engaging your attention.

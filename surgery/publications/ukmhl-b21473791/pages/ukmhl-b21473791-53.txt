43 names of the processes of bones, and liga. ments which connect one bone with an- other, the articular shape of their extremi- ties, how they lock into each other, how they are supported by muscles as well as by ligaments in their situation, should be attentively considered. Upon a due know- ledge of the joints often depends a sur- geon's character. Nothing can be more injurious to a practitioner, than to let a dislocation escape his enquiries, which another from his superior knowledge of anatomy has been able to detect. But, gentlemen, you will have the advantage in this school of the friendly assistance of Mr. Adams and Doctor McDowell to direct and superintend your anatomical pursuits ; and to their care I consign you. Do not waste your time at anatomical lectures by taking notes. Anatomy is more to be learned by the eye than by the understanding. I am not an advocate for notes at any lecture ; while the student is marking down part of what has fallen from the professor, another part, and perhaps the more important, escapes his attention.

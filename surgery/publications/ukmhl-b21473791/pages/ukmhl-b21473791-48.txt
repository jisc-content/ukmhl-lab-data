38 that there are actually no diseases that af- fect the one which do not influence the other. How, in the name of common sense, does it happen, that even this ima- ginary line of demarcation between Physic and Surgery was established by the wisdom of colleges and universities ; so that the individual who is to practise one branch, may, if he can, be ignorant of the other; and that this line of demarcation is, in fact, in this very city, and at this improved pe- riod of science, if report be true, so far in- sisted upon, that a knowledge of surgery is even deemed a disqualification for the prac- tice of physic. For on no other principle can I imagine a bye-law or regulation of the King and Queen's College of Physicians to be framed, (if it be possible such a bye-law can exist,) which will not admit to the test of an examination any individual who is a Licentiate or Member of the College of Surgeons in Ireland, until he has qualified himself (to use an Irishism) by a disquali- fication, L e. by removing his name from the roll of theXollege of Sui'geons.

26 converse and reason with the same facility as when in the enjoyment of perfect health ; and I have even heard one indi- vidual jest on some passing occurrence within a minute or two of his dissolution ; a circumstance which proves how little the brain, and the system of nerves imme- diately arising from it, were affected by a cause capable of rapidly destroying life, and evinces the great difference between the ganglionic and cerebro-spinal systems of nerves. Until lately, it was supposed that the same nerves proceeding from the spinal marrow, performed the double office of sensation and motion; it has, however, been proved, by Mr. Charles Bell (a dis- covery which reflects upon him the highest honor), that the posterior fasciculi of nerves proceeding from the spinal marrow, are the nerves which afford the property of sensa- tion to the parts on which they are dis- tributed ; and that the anterior fasciculi, on the contrary, give the faculty of motion. These facts are proved by experiments, which have been repeated with similar results by ^Majendie and others.

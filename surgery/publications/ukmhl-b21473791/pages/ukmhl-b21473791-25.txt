15 impoverish still farther this impoverished land. When we take a survey of the various public charitable institutions of this po- pulous city, there is not one which can compete with the House of Industry and its extensive hospital establishment for the purposes of a medical school. This insti- tution, although still called the House of Industry, has altogether changed its cha- racter from its original formation. It may now be considered a vast hospital for the admission of those who, from chronic disease and bodily infirmities, are incapable of ob- taining a subsistence, and contains, exclu- sive of those in its hospitals, a population of 1508 persons. It has attached to it three distinct hospitals, a fever, a medical, and a surgical hospital. The hospitals combined contain at present 452 patients. There is also a dispensary attached to the institution for the poor of the north-west district of Dublin, at which the averaged number of patients prescribed for daily amount to one hundred and fifty.

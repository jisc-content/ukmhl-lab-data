33 If a surgeon is called to a case of acute ophthalmia in a patient labouring under gout or rheumatism, if he has not these diseases in his mind, he may render very ineffectual aid to his patient under the or- dinary methods of the treatment of simple ophthalmia. The inflammation of gout often attacks, in its most acute form, the conjunctiva of the eye; but on the recur- rence of the inflammation to the foot from which it had receded, that of the eye as rapidly disappears. Here then, in the first instance, the business of the surgeon is, by hot fomentations and irritating applications, to bring back the inflammation to the foot, to exhibit colchicum, and those means most capable of removing, as rapidly as possible, a dangerous inflammation from a part es- sential to the future comforts of the patient, even though the means employed may not benefit the general disease. Then surely the surgeon, to be enabled to treat such a case, ought to have a knowledge of the na- ture and treatment of rheumatism and gout. D

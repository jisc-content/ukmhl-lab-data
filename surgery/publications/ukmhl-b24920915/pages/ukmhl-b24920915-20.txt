12 As to the amount of work, this could not have been accomplished single-handed ; it was physically impossible. To my most able non-resident assistants, Dr Knox, now professor of surgery in St Mungo’s College ; to Dr James W, Downie, now lecturer on diseases of the ear and throat in Glasgow University; to Dr Macartney, now surgeon in the Cancer Hospital; and to Dr Robert Kennedy, surgeon to the Western Infirmary Dispensary, I return my most grateful thanks for their never-failing assistance in many a prolonged morning’s work.

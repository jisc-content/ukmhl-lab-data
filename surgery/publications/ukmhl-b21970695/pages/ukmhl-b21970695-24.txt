16 EEPOET OF SUEGICAL CASES m THE AEMY. by Assistant Surgeon H. R, Tilton, United States Army. It is a ponderous cranium, weighing nearly two pounds avoirdupois.* There were a few cases of gunshot scalp-wounds, only noticeable from the prompt- ness with which the men recovered and returned to duty.

Laying aside the gunshot fractures of the Indian crania, regarding the histories of which there are no reliable special data, and the nine gunshot scalp-wounds, which are comparatively unimportant, we have, in the preceding abstracts, memoranda of thirty-eight cases of gunshot fractures of the skull. Five were received in fights with Indians; four in connection with provost duty ; eight in brawls ; ten accidentally; and eleven by suicide. Of these thirty-eight examples of gunshot fractures of the cranium, there were but seven instances of recoveries. Gunshot Wounds of the Face.—This class of injuries has been illustrated by several cases that have furnished interesting pathological contributions to the Museum, and by others that involve delicate points in practice. XXXVII.—Note of a Case of Gunshot Wotmd of the Face. By H. A. DuBoiS, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A. Corporal Edward Swords, Co. D, 3d United States Cavalry, aged 26 years, was admitted to the post hospital at Fort Union, New Mexico, June 7, 1867, with a gunshot wound of the face. The ball entered the left superior maxilla one inch from its junction with the nasal bone and same distance from the margin of orbit, and passed obliquely backward and a little downward, and lodged behind the posterior fold of the palatine arch. The wound in the face was enlarged, and pieces of bone were removed. The ball, which could be felt in its place of lodgement, was not taken out, but was swallowed by the patient during the following night. On June 30th, the wound had nearly healed, but some necrosed fragments remained. He was discharged the service December 4, 1867. * Many illustrations of multiple gunshot perforations of Indian crania Lave been brought to the Museum from Sand Creek, Colorado, the scene of the atrocious massacre of friendly Indians by the troops under C(d()ucl .John M.

E, 4tli Cavalry, was killed by Indians, on September 30, 1870, twenty miles from Fort Concho, Texas, while on dnty as one of the mail-stage guard from Fort Cbadbonrne. The escort being attacked by a band of Comanches, this soldier was wounded by an iron-headed arrow, which entered the squamous portion of the left temporal bone, and penetrated the left cerebral hemisphere to a depth of an inch or more, causing intracranial bleeding which was speedily fatal. In the specimen which was for- warded to the Army Medical Museum, and which is represented in the accompanying wood-cut (Fig. 27) the puncture of tbe thin calvaria, without tissuring, is well indicated. Internally there is no splintering. The vitrous table is as cleanly- divided as the outer table. It was Dr. Bill's belief {loc. cit., p. 375,) that penetrations of the skull by arrows were unusually characterized by a linear puncture of the outer table, corresponding to the size of the arrow-head, with a crack usually extending from either edge, proportionate in length to the momentum of the arrow, while the inner table, struck by the arrow's point at a reduced velocity was splintered and depresssd. But such is not the testimony of the specimens in the Army Medical Museum. They show both tables of the calvaria punctui'ed with little or no tissuring externally or internally. In all of the specimens, the

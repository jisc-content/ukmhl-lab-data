282 EEPOKT OF SURGICAL CASES IN THE AEMY. REVIEW AND CONCLUSION. The one thousand and thirty-seven cases recorded in the foregoing pages, with more or less detail, are but a small portion of those entered under the head of Class V on the monthly reports of sick and wounded for the period embraced by this report. The casualties thus entered numbered over sixty thousand.* The following consolidation from the numerical reports indicates the relative frequency of the (^fferent classes of wounds, accidents, and injuries: f Aiati-act of Wounds, Accidents, and Injuries reported on the Monthly Reports of Sick and Wounded of the United States Army for the Period commencing July 1, 18G5, and ending December 31, 1870.

All of the evidence being thus presented to them, it was thought that medical officers would hereafter be enabled to determine precisely what cases it would be advisable to make the subject of special reports, and the extent and form in which said reports should be made. Many letters of inquiry on these points have been received by this Division of the Office, and it has been difficult sometimes to answer them definitely. The gravest wounds are occasionally devoid of interest because of their immediate or inevitable fatality ; while the most trivial accidents may be followed by formidable complications, demanding the most careful study, and yielding the most instructive illustrations. It is very desirable that the name and military description should be noted in all cases entered under Class V on the monthly report of sick and wounded, and that the patient should appear, by name, on the report of the following months, until he is finally accounted for. Thus, it will become practicable to identify always such patients, and when they are moved from one post to another to trace their histories. The memoranda of grave cases can hardly be too minute, or of trivial _cases too concise, provided means of identification of the patient are afforded. It is hardly necessary to insist on the * The exact number is 61,105. t The period covered hy the consolidation does not precisely correspond with that considered in the Report; but the ratios are the same. At the beginning of the period the Army numbered over 150,000 ; but it was rapidly reduced to 80,000; then to 54,000, and finally to 30,000, its present nominal strength.

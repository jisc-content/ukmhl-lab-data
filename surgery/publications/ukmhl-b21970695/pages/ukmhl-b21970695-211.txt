203 AMPUTATIONS AT THE KNEE-JOINT. fracture of the right internal malleolus, with an external wound communicating with the joint, a compound fracture of one of the phalanges of each toe of the right foot, except the great toe, a lacerated wound of the left side of the face, extending from the external angle of the eye to the ear, a lacerated wound of the scalp and of the right ear, and several contusions and abrasions on different parts of the body. On the 6th, he was admitted into a temporary hospital erected for him at the post of Darlington, South Carolina, and on the 8th, chloroform was administered and the limb amputated at the middle third by the antero posterior flap method. There was but little haemorrhage, only two ligatures being necessary. At the time of the operation, the limb was swollen and painful; the patient was feverish; pulse 120; and there was concussion of the brain. Simple dressings were applied. The patient reacted promptly. On the 30th of September, the stump was healing finely, and a complete recovery was soon exijected. Amputations at the Knee-joint.—Three successful operations were reported. DLXXXII.—Report of Two Cases of Amputation at the Knee-Joint for Gunshot Injury. By John D. Hall, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A. Case I.—Private Thomas Nipple, Troop F, 3d Cavalry, was shot on March 31, 1870, with a Colt's Army pistol, carrying a conical ball of a calibre four inches. The ball entered the right leg below and very close to the cavity of the knee-joint, i^assed within the outer hamstring tendon, downward and inward, through the head of the tibia, and matle exit iipon the inner surface of the tibia. On careful examination, no fracture of the bone could be discovered—a few small pieces and spiculfB of bone near the exit wound, and nothing more. I concluded, also, that the cavity of the knee-joint was not opened. At 9 P. M., nine hours after the accident, the pulse was 60, and the patient comfortable. Date. Hour. Pulse. Temperature. Date.

During this time, the wound seemed to be doing well, and there were no symi)toms of inflammation in the neighboring joint—neither pain nor swelling. April 21, 9 A.M.: Pulse 76; temperature 98J. 9 P.M.: Pulse 120; temperature 103. Here was a marked change. The patient now complained of pain in the right knee. On the morning of April 22d, his pulse was 108; temi)erature 101-}, and in the evening his pulse rose to 134 ; temperature 105. The knee was still painful and somewhat swollen. It was evident that the knee-joint had become involved. For several days, local applications were persistently applied, but increased swelling and signs of suppuration within the joint began to appear. Soon after, hectic symptoms began, and the consti- tution seemed failing. May 3d: I amputated the limb. This was done through the knee-joint, making a long anterior and a short posterior flap, and sawing off about an inch of the condyles, after the manner of Mr. Carden, of Worcester. This operation is also recommended by Martoe, of New York. The anaesthetic used in this case was chloroform. The knee-joint was full of foetid, unhealthy pus, and this extended also above the joint, along the cellular planes of the

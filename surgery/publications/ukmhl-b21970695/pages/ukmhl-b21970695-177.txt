He was found on the following morning lying on the snow, in a comatose state, and immediately brought to the hospital, where, upon examination, it was found that both feet and legs were badly frozen nearly to the knees, and that his hands and part of his arms were in the same condition. All efforts to rouse him, or procure reaction, proved unavailing. It is supposed he was very much intoxicated. The thermometer, at 7 A. M. on the morning he was found, was 33° F. below zero. The condition of the man, from the time of his admission until death, would not admit of amputation. 22

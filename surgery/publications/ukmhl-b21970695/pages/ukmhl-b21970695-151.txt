143 DISLOCATIONS. Dislocations at the Hip.—Of dislocations of the lower extremity, only one case was reported in detail, or by name. This was a case of luxation at the hip, in which the difficulty of reduction was increased by the inevitable delay in procuring surgical aid. COCCL.—Note relative to a Case of Luxation at the Eip. By L. E. Holmes, M. D., Actiug Assistant Surgeon. Private Edward Hollen, Co. K, 23d Infantry, aged 24 years, was admitted to tbe liospital at CamiJ Logan, Oregon, in February, 1868.

EEPOET OF SUEGICAL CASES IN THE AEMY. 234 the iDjured parts. This relief was so marked that even had the case terminated fatally, I think operative interference was warranted with a view to euthanasia. It will also be noticed that treatment by extension and counter-extension was abandoned after a trial of a few days, and I feel quite certain that this particular case did better without it. The case was admirably suited for the operation of excision; a better one could not well have been selected. There was no injury to the vessels or nerves, and none to the soft parts, save the small wound of entrance; the pelvic walls were not injured; there were no abscesses, and but little swelling about the joint. The neck and head of the femur alone bore the brunt of the injury." The four cases above enumerated, the sixty-three operations done during the American War, the twelve operations prior to that war, and eight more cases recently published, make an aggregate of eighty-seven excisions at the hip for injury, with eight recoveries, a mortality rate of 91.9. But we have the great satisfaction of knowing that of the survivors of this operation, four can walk comparatively well, without assistance. It has occurred to me to examine many patients recovered from excisions at the hip for coxaljia, but none of them had regained the use of their limbs to such an extrent as Hugh Wright,* for whom Dr. Mursick excised the head and trochanters of the femur, shattered by a ball. The recovery of Dr. Gibson's patient was yet more perfect, and fully verified the prediction of Mr. Blenkins,f that inutility of the limb would not prove to be inevitably the result of such operations. â€¢ Mursick, New Medical Jotinial, Vol. I, p. 424. t Blenku^s, 1. c.

As has been already remarked, the mortality rate was unusually small. In looking over the reports, it is impossible to avoid the conviction that the medical officers greatly profited by the experience of the War, and performed their operations with little regard for the narrow rules laid down in the text-books, preferring to adapt their incisions to the exigencies of particular cases. The method of making flaps of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, reflecting them, and dividing the muscles circularly, which had many advocates during the War, remains in favor.

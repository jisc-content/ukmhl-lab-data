REPORT OF SURGICAL CASES IN THE ARMY. 190 he was anassthetized, when a furtlier examination of the injury led to the couchision that a prompt removal at the articnlatiou was the best and only chance of saving life. As the subclavian could not be properly compresed, owing to a full development of the chest and shoulders, and the absence of proper assistance, a touruiqiiet was applied over the axillary artery and retained in situ by an assistant, the screw being placed over the superior border of the scapula and retained in position by a tape passed around the chest. An incision, begun immediately below the acromion process, was carried down through the belly of the deltoid muscle, about three inches; then, making a curve around the external extremity of the humerus to the axilla, a similar flap was made on the inner side, and the bone was disarticulated. The axillary artery was ligated, and after the cessation of a little venous oozing, the flaps were brought together by interrupted sutui-es aud adhesive strips, not more than an ounce of blood having been lost during the operation. The patient reacted promptly, when a stimulant, followed by an anodyne, was administered, and cold-water dressings were applied. He slept well, and on the ISth his condition was fair. The remaining treatment in this case wa&. chiefly expectant. By December 31st the patient had entirely recovered with a good round shoulder. He was discharged April 9,18G7. The specimen, with the history, was contributed to the Army Medical Museum, by the operator, and is No. 5595, Surgical Section.

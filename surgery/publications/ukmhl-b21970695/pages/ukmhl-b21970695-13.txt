A REPORT OF SURGICAL CASES TREATED IK THE ARMY OP THE UNITED STATES PROM 1865 TO 1871. By G-EOR&E J^. OTIS, Assistant Surgeon, United States Army. WAR DEPARTMENT, SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE, Division of Suegical Records, Washington, August 15, 1871. General : In obedience to your instructions, I respectfully submit a report I have compiled from the returns and special reports of medical officers of surgical cases, more particularly of those pertaining to operative surgery, observed in the Army during the past five years. Although the cases in each category are not sufficiently numerous to warrant any very important generalizations, yet every such contribution must be of value in adding to the mass of facts from which important inferences may be hereafter deduced. I have endeavored to classify the observations in the shape most convenient for ref- erence, to correct the more obvious errors inseparable from hasty composition, to provide illustrations on wood or stone where requisite, to sum up the inferences and conclusions deducible from the different series of cases, and to be sparing in comment.* When practicable the language of the reporters has been followed textually ; but often it has been necessary to trace the histories of cases througli successive monthly state- ments, and to compile a connected narrative. *" Je sais que la verite est dans les choses, et non dans mon esprit qui les jtige, et que moins je mets du mien dans les jugcmenti que fen x'orte. plus je silts sur d'approclier de la verite."â€”J.

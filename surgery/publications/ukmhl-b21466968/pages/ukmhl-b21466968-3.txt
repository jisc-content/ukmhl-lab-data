2^ Reprinted from the " Lancet "for 10th January, 1879.] ONE YEAR'S SURGICAL OPERATIONS IN THE WESTEEN INFIRMAEY, GLASGOW. BY ALEXANDER PATTERSON, M.D., Surgeon and Lecturer on Clinical Surgery. % c At the meeting of the British Medical Association held in Cork, in the month of August last, Mr. Savory, of St. Bartholomew's, delivered a most eloquent and interesting address on the Prevention of Blood-poisoning in the Practice of Surgery. In the course of his address he made some pointed remarks regarding the absence of statistics from those who practise Lister's method. With much diffidence I take up the glove, and, in the following short paper, shall endeavour to give, on a limited scale, one year's operative work, carried through on the antiseptic principle; and by that is here meant, the Listerian plan of treatment without any change or fancied improvement. Three small surgical wards, always kept scrupulously clean and thoroughly ven- tilated—two for males and one for females—on the upper floor of the hospital, are placed under my charge. The beds number only nineteen, although fi-equently they contain twenty patients. The following is a list of the operations, performed on resident patients only, during the twelve months extending from 31st October, 1878, till 1st November, 1879.

8 this and other matters, and hitherto no reply has been vouchsafed. Operations per bed per annvm.—Let any one conversant with hospital work think for a moment of the difference as to the probability of blood-poisoning occurring in 8t. Bar- tholomew's, where so few operations are . performed in proportion to the number of beds, and where erysipelas and pypemia prevail, compared with small, crowded wards, con- taining only nineteen beds, with frequently fifteen to seven- teen cases operated on in them. All former experience would lead us to expect epidemic outbreaks of blood- poisoning in the latter, yet they never appear. As Mr. Savory issued the challenge, he will, I trust, pardon me remarking that the antiseptic system has enabled one, with only nineteen beds under his charge, to perform more than one-third as many operations in twelve months as the entire surgical staff of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in the same period, with nearly four hundred beds at their command. Taking into account the number of operations, the low death-rate, the number of beds, and the small quantity of stimulants used, as a year's operative work, the foregoing has probably never been surpassed in any general hospital. The credit must be ascribed to a system of treatment which enables us to perform operations and to achieve results of which our predecessors never dreamed—a method of treat- ment which has revolutionised surgery, and which entitles its author to rank among the greatest benefactors of our common race.

3 No case of erysipelas occurred during the year, and since the wards were opened, four yeai'S ago, there has not been a single case of pyeemia. In addition to the above, thex'e were 162 persons treated as out-door patients, upon whom 86 operations were per- formed without any unfavourable result. Many of these, under the old plan of treatment, must have been taken into the house, thus taking up beds required for graver cases. Want of space compelled us, and the antiseptic treatment enabled us, to treat them as out-door patients. This fact is of very great importance, and is one of the greatest advan- tages of the Listerian method. From 31st October, 1877, till 1st November, 1878, there were:— lu-door patients admitted ... ... ... 234 Operations performed ... ... ... ... 119 Deaths ... ... ... ... ... 6 And the first five items were as follows (Glasgow Medical Journal, July, 1879):— No. Deaths. Nepkrotomy ... ... ... ... 1 ... 0 Osteotomy ... ... ... ... 6 ... 0 Herniotomy ... ... ... ... 5 ... 0 Ligature of femoral ... ... ... 3 ... 0 Amputation of thigh ... ... ... 9 ... 1 Remarks. Herniotomy.—The cutting operation for strangulated hernia I have performed seventy-nine times, and have always opened the sac. We can never be certain that adhesions do not exist within the sac, nor can we form an accurate opinion as to the state of the intestines. In a case of small, acutely strangulated femoral hernia, we may have gangrene in half-a-dozen hours, whilst in an old protrusion strangled in an old man (oblique inguinal, I mean) as many days may possibly elapse, and yet the bowel may retain its vitality. It is never the operation, when properly per- formed, which kills the patient, but the delay which takes place in seeking assistance.

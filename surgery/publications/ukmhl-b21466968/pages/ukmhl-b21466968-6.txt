4 Osteotomy.—In the thirty-two operations, forty corn- pound fractures were made, and Mr. Savory will admit that neither he nor any of his colleagues has had the good fortune to treat, in one year, so many compound fractures without some untoward complicatioas. No doubt the patients' ages ranged from ten to thirty-one years, the best period of life for recovery from injuries, and no doubt, also, there was little or no injury done to the soft parts. Still the fact remains that nearly all those limbs were put up immediately after the operation, and never disturbed or looked at for some weeks, when bones and skin wounds were found united, the dressing not being once changed. Many compound fractui-es from accident can be treated in a similar manner; and will any surgeon venture to affirm that a mode of dressins: which ensures perfect rest to the fragments from the beginning to the end of the case, which does away Avith all constitutional disturbance, and which ensures the patient from all risk of erysipelas or pytemia, is not superior to any plan of treat- ment hitherto practised ? Vesico-vaginal fistula outside the vagina.—The patient, a married woman, aged forty-nine, suffered for years fi-om prolapsus of the pelvic viscera, for the support of which she had been recommended to wear a metal pessary. This she continued to wear for about a year, when pain in the lower part of the abdomen compelled her to remove it, and on doing so the protrusion at once recurred. On examina- tion, a curious state of matters is presented; a tumour larger than a child's head hangs between the thighs ; the growth has a covering like skin, with patches of ulceration here and there, while on its anterior aspect there is to be seen a transverse opening, an inch and a half in length, through which urine constantly trickles. On introducing a catheter by the urethra, instead of passing up behind the .symphysis pubis, it turned downwards in front of the tumour, and its tip could be passed out of the opening. On introducing the finger into the rectum, it was carried down the posterior side of the mass, thus showing that

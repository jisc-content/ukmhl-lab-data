Every body knows arith- metic, and the certainty that two and two make four, and probably, also, that if the radius is given, the whole circle is given. It cannot be asserted that any mind is totally deficient in comprehending the first steps of this science; and perseverance in application may reasonably be supposed to implant some degree of sufficiency. The variations that occur in the application of the mind, either in regard to science, or generally to the purposes of life, arising from the innate distinction of the intellectual powers, must un- questionably attract a large share of consideration. As the mind is in truth the very principle of life, when applied to the actions of man, and to the relations which he has to all around him, so it is of great importance to determine every bias that may give it an impetus in a particular direction, by which a disturbing force is created in the calcu- lation of its operations.

The distinction between the perceptuous and the geometrical character of mind is, for the most part, fully striking in the powers each possesses. Thus we do not see, with

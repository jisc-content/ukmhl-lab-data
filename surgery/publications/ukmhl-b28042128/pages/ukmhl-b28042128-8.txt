CLAIMS OF SURGERY TO BE Yin allow this conclusion. It is true that the intellect more readily conceives the relations which number and quantity present to it, than it does those of other objects; this being necessary in order that the mind may acquire necessary truths. It cannot be predicated that natural knowledge is excluded from being placed in the elevated con- dition of absolute science, until the most proper means have been instituted for establishing its scientific character. It is not at all unlikely that a rooted habit of looking to the acuteness of the senses for the sources of its principles, has left surgery so long unenlightened by the beams which intellectual truths can throw around it. In the conflicting notions that men have of science, they seem to imply that it may be attained by some other means than by the mental faculties, as if there was any other way by which absolute truth can be arrived at. Science is the comprehension of truth in any of the departments of knowledge*, over which the mind has the power of giving certainty to the results of its investigations. On the other hand, we constantly hear the term applied to the knowledge of things derived from the senses, and not from the intellect, and therefore such know- ledge is neither fixed nor certain, because it is not capable of being demonstrated. Science is represented as the clear knowledge of * Knowledge here signifies all information conveyed to the mind of whatsoever description.

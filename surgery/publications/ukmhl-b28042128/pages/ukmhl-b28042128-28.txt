XXX CLAIMS OF SURGERY TO RE them tone. That opinions have but a small value in a scientific point of view, is proved by their unstableness, and by the readiness with which they are changed. Thus the practice of surgery is apparently not only taught, but pursued, by pre- scription, and but little on principles of science. The qualifications of the practitioner who may be placed within the pale of the preceding descrip- tion, are such as Bacon entitled empirici; the knowledge required for such practice is heaped up, and cast, as it were, into the memory, and then any part is taken out separately, as it may be wanted, and for a limited purpose, without any regard to all the conditions under which it may exist in relation with other things. This cannot be called scientific practice. For the purposes of scientific practice the mind must be contemplative, and ponder on every step as it proceeds, in which way it institutes every means of making com- parisons, of analysing the conditions, and of study- ing the relations in disease ; and the scientific man, knowing the foundation by which he is supported, reposes in confidence on the security of the plans he adopts. The fact is, that it is not the possession of all that is known in all the branches of the surgeon’s profession, that “necessarily implies that he is a scientific man, or that he practises scien- tifically. It is the scientific quality of his mind that enables him to give the character of science to that which he knows, by making those correct

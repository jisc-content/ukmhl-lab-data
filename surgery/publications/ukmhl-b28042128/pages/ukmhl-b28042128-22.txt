CLAIMS OF SURGERY TO BE xxu from the supposed sufficiency of the perceptions to ground a judgment. But the English word more analogous to the French is, subtle mind. But it has been shown that to be satisfied with the soundness of principles, they must be founded on some necessary and immutable truths. And it has been stated above that the mind can only apprehend the truth of things by means of those relations which the intellect has the power of dis- covering. It will thus be seen, that while the per- ceptuous character of mind clearly and correctly sees all that perception can convey to it, it is satis- fied that it has ascended to the very limits of in- formation that the understanding can have. But the geometrical character carries its powers of intellectual investigations to much higher regions than those to which the other can arrive. In the allusion made, in reference to this quality of mind, to geometry, it is not supposed that a high degree of mathematical acquirements should be possessed; it is only intended to show that the intellect, to be entitled to the appellation, should have the facility of noticing all the relations of things that are presented to observation, and the power of comparing them in the mind; so that by an abstract process the principles of science may be elicited. It will be evident, from what has been said, that in prosecuting an inquiry, which has the cha- racter of science for its subject, the peculiarities

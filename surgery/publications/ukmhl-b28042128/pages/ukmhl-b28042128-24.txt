It is a very ditferent thing merely to know what others have done for enlarging the boundaries of science, to that of possessing the intellectual power, adapted for increasing its principles. The essential quality of the intellectual character of the mind has been explained, in the allusion to the geometrical problems that arise, by simply placing- two lines across each other. It is that quality of intellect which quickly understands the intelligible ideas of things in a way by which all the relations, in every possible condition in which those things can exist, are discoverable; the only way the real nature of things, and the fundamental truths of science can be obtained. It must be apparent that although the perceptuous character is best calculated for a clear conception and accurate de- scription of all the facts subservient to science, and for placing them in the best point of view to be comprehended by others, yet it is limited in its capability to promote science. But it has

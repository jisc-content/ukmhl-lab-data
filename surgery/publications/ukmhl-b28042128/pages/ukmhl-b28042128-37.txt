CLASSED AS A SCIENCE. XXXIX while the aspirations of the intellectual are smo- thered by the insatiable nature of cupidity. “ Mise- ricordia in eo et perfidia pari jure dilectre. Nulla apud eum turpis ratio vincendi. Blandus pariter et invidiosus in alloquio; in seria et jocos artifex. Amicitias utilitate non fide colebat. Inter htec eloquentia insignis; oratio acuminis et solertiaj plena, ut nee ornatui facilitas, nec facilitati inven- tionum deesset ornatus.” * Those who are fully satisfied that scientific sur- gery is making great advances, should produce the proofs necessary to substantiate the fact, and give the instances of the close connection of science with surgery. It appears to me that the most part of what is handed down to us, is rather a series of mere opinions, as they have been suc- cessively formed, with continual changes, than a code of scientific principles. We have, indeed, received the benefits of men of talent, in bringing new facts to light, but only with the results like those of the artist in his studio, or the manipulator in his museum — representations of things. We have no display of a master-intellect, that has elicited, by the discovery of relations, immutable truths, and combined them into an associated whole, so as to make a science of surgery. Hunter had a mind constituted for accomplishing this great work. He is admired but not followed. * Justin.

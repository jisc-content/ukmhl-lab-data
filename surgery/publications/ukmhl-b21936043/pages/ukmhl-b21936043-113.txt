103 CONSTITUTION TO BE STUDIED BEFORE OPERATION. chance of recovery would have been infinitely less; because the nervous power, which governs the frame, would have been exhausted by its own ac- tivity, and these vital actions which depend upon it would, in their turn, have ceased to be continued. It is well, on this account, for the young practitioner to measure the moral, as well as the physical character of his patients, before he under- takes very decisive means. For as they are both mixed up together, to form what is called the constitution, this last can never be philosophically known without its component parts being somewhat made out; nor would the practitioner know how much it would bear, were he in ignorance of its true character. I should not have dared to have taken such bold liberties with this old man's constitution, after it had endured a severe operation, had he posses- sed this quick, high temperament, sensibility, nervous irritability, or what- ever it may be denominated, and which,—however it may be compounded of matter or of mind, and in whatever proportions,—feels every-thing, yields to every-thing, leads the body into all possible mischief, and which is rare- ly remedied, though frequently increased, by bleeding or other lowering means. I have chosen to consider the peritonitis as the effect of the long con- tinued and severe sounding previous to the operation, rather than of the latter itself, because there were no circumstances in it which indicated much violence or suffering. Holliday was well when I last heard of him, and of course the saccu- lated stone had been in no way injurious. It is probable, that a calculus, thus closely confined in a sac of the bladder, does little harm there; and when above the pelvis, it is not even likely to congregate more sabulous matter about it. If all this be true, if its close imprisonment admits not of that dreadful rolling of a loose stone in the bottom of the bladder, which irritates, inflames, and thickens the organ, and wears out the patient with pain,—why is it thought necessary to ferret out the sacculated one with so much anxiety and positive mischievous violence.

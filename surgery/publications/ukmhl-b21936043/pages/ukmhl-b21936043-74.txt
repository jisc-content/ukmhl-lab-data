CHRONIC TUMOUR ON THE CHEEK FROM CARIOUS FANGS. 64 NOTE IV. Chronic Abscess on the CheeJc, assummg", in some degree, the character of a tumour, from the irritation of a carious tooth, or its fangs. 1 have made a memorandum of this affection, as it is, perhaps, not ge- nerally understood. The swelling is of a pale, purplish red colour, and is gently raised above the plane of the cheek, giving something of the appearance of a stru- mous abscess, with its low tone and imperfect suppuration. This tumour, however, has a firmer feel than the abscess, and the skin covering it looks thicker. This resemblance to a strumous swelling, which is so common about the jaw, is a principal source of the two affections being so commonly con- founded, and will serve to explain, in some degree, the erroneous treatment employed for the cure of this particular affection. I have known it cut out from the cheek, by clever and experienced men, as a tumour that could not be got rid of without; and I have known it opened, causticated, and treated in all manner of ways but the right one, which is by extracting the fangs of a carious tooth, which will always be found placed opposite to it. It is barely supposable that opening the swel- ling, (in the interior of which will be found a small quantity of unhealthy pus, mixed sometimes with a slight fungous growth,) and treating it in the ordinary way, may occasionally succeed; because the fangs themselves may in time recover, which is the cause of it. But such treatment, by neglect- ing the cause, is unscientific : moreover, a large deformed eschar would be the effect, and which would have the additional advantage of looking ex- actly like the remains of a scrophulous abscess. On removing the tooth, with its fang or fangs, the tumour gradually disappears without further treatment. The fangs of the tooth will have attached to them a small fungous growth, resembling the fungus found in the interior of the tumour.

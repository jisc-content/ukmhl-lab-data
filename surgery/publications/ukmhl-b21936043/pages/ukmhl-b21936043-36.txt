STRICTURES OF THE (ESOPHAGUS, AND 26 NOTE II. On Strictures of the (Esophagus, and the dangers of the Bougie. Were the irregularities and difficulties encountered in Practice con- stantly and honestly narrated, (as recommended hereafter in the case of failures,) by practitioners, the i3rogress of improvement in our profession would be more rapid, and the power of preserving life, and abridging many forms of human suffering greatly increased. Of all these forms, there is not one in the whole range, in the entire catalogue of human woes and wretchedness equal, at least in contempla- tion, to the effects of stricture of the oesophagus; for the strongest mind must recoil and shudder at the probability of being starved to death.

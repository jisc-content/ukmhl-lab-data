MEMBRANOUS STRICTURE. 29 CASE I. Membranous Stricture. Death from a false passage made hy the IBoiigie A maiden lady, aged sixty, who for nearly thirty years had been afflict- ed with severe forms of dyspepsia, and who had taken opening medicine almost daily for the whole of that period, now began to complain to her medical attendant of nneasiness about her throat, and across the lower part of the neck, with painful and difficult deglutition. Soon afterwards I M as consulted, and upon expressing an opinion that there might be a stricture of the oesophagus, she sat down to allow me an examination. With some difficulty I got through a stricture beyond the cricoid car- tilage, with a small-sized black instrument, but not until I had turned its point considerably to the left; it then appeared to grate over a rough surface.

I recommended the anticipated sores from the bursting of the abscesses to be made into issues, and that the bougie be passed cautiously three times a week, and to increase the size gradually if possible. It was a month afterwards before I again heai'd of this lady; her

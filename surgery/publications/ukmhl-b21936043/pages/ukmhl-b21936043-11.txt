NOTES. NOTE I. On the sources of the Spasm of the Glottis. It may appear strange to write on the origin of an affection which some may believe not to exist, and yet there is a practical value in the facts of those cases which bear upon the question. When we hear of a sudden death from a simple sore throat, we are struck with alarm, and surprised at the imperfection of art, which ad- mitted such an awful visitation to take place from a cause so apparently insignificant. But there are some subjects less understood than others, and our sur- prise at such events must diminish, when we reflect on their rarity. The attention is not often attracted to the subject of suffocation from those af- fections of the throat, and we therefore know the less of its causes. But it is a knowledge very necessary to possess; of the highest value; as life hangs upon it; and one too perchance of the most^precious character. Admitting therefore, that life may sometimes be cut short by sudden suffocation from a sore throat, or an abscess, or a wen, it becomes necessary to know in the first place, the exact mode by which that process is effected, before we can have much chance in arresting its fatal progress; and lastly, we must discover the several causes, or particular affections, which will set this process in motion.

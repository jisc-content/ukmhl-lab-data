INTRODUCTION. The slight nature of the facts and observations contained in the fol- lowing Notes, and the desultory, free, and colloquial manner in which they are written, are, perhaps, more suited to the private practical purposes of the case-book, than the public eye;—and that such imperfections should have been presented to it, may require some explanation. The Author has no other to offer than the truth. During a long pe- riod of deep affliction, he sometimes found relief in correcting his notes, and the result is a selection of them for publication,—a trifling measure at the best, never originally intended, and which, in happier days, would either not have been carried into effect at all, or in a manner more becom- ing his professional appearance before the public. The present Part of these Notes may contain a few facts and cases ia general surgery, sufficient, possibly, to interest the reader. They may also attract his attention to safer means for the relief of the desperate and me- lancholy condition of a human being starving to death;—and to a closer consideration, and prevention, of some causes of Sudden death: an awful event, never rationally desirable to the most wretched in this life, and often productive of incalculable moral evil, to those who remain to encounter its troubles. Gloucester, May 25, 1831.

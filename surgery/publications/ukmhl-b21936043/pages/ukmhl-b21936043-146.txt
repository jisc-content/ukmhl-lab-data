136 EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTIS. NOTE IX. Itiflamniation of the Testis,—often inducing Effusion, Abscess and Fungus,, or, short of these, leaving the organ of great size, and indolent hardness. Such is the description in my note book, given to the series of effects induced by inflammation of the testis, and which has been since so ably described and illustrated by Sir A. Cooper, under the appellation of chro- nic inflammation of the testis. This description is complete, and the term "chronic inflammation" may be correct, though, from having seen the disease originate frequently from accidents which induced acute inflammation in the first instance, (though not being strongly marked) I have always considered the affection as simple ordinary inflammation of the testis, modified by peculiarity of constitution, and ultimately producing the effects described at the head of this note. If the inflammatory action be a little higher than is usually ob- served in the slower progress of this affection, effusion or abscess is the effect. Should it be of a more feeble and languid nature, the testis is left of a great size and hardness, and the constitutional powers of the patient are unequal to the task of dissipating the mass of additional matter, left by the imperfect inflammatory process which preceded and caused it:—and it is in this state of indolence and insensibility of the part that art also fails very frequently to be of much service. It succeeds sometimes in reducing the size of the testis, and the patient goes away satisfied;—he returns with it, increased again perhaps, to be relieved; and in this manner the case pro- ceeds, sometimes better, and then worse, until he gradually and ultimately

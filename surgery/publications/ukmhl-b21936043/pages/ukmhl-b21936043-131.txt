CHRONIC ENCYSTED TUMOUR OF THE SCROTUM. 121 NOTE VIII. On a chronic encysted Tumour found near the Testis, ivhose external appear- ance resembles commonly the encysted Hydrocele of the cord; and may he confounded with affections of the Testis itself. Of the deceitful forms of tumours of the scrotum, and the errors and confusion to which they lead in practice, there can be no doubt; and a can- did surgeon of much experience will not deny, that his own practice has, every now and then, furnished an example of the truth of this position. The present note does not relate to watery collections appearing either above, in front, or on either side of the testis, formed in the tunica vaginalis, testis itself, or in the cells of the cord; these, however interesting, as por- tions of irregular surgery, are not touched on here, with the exception of two varieties of encysted hydrocele of the cord, at the end of this note. To the eye, the chronic tumour in question sometimes assumes an ex- act representation of the encysted hydrocele of the cord, when that affection approaches very low down the scrotum, near to the testis ; (see the compa- rative prints) to the eye also, and when conjoined with the hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, it has sometimes a strong resemblance to that form of hy- drocele of the tunica vaginalis which has an indentation across a portion of its surface, dividing it into two tumours of unequal magnitude, and which may be imitated on a common hydrocele, by drawing a thread across it, and bearing upon its extremities.

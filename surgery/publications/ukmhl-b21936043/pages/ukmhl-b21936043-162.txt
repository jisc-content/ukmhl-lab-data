PLATE II, Exhibits views of the memhranous and cartilaginous strictures of the CEso-- phagus, with the instrument designed hy the Author, to dilate or lacerate them. Fig. 1. Membranous stricture of the oesophagus. a. Inner lining of the oesophagus, puckered or corrugated. b. In a greater degree here, so as to nearly close the channel of the oeso- phagus, through which a small bougie only would pass, as seen in Fig. 2. The closed dilator passed through the stricture. Fig. 3. The extremity of the dilator opened, to shew its structure, and mode of operation. Fig. 4. A fine specimen of the cartilaginous, or what might be called scirrhous stricture of the oesophagus. a. Epiglottis. b. Inner surface of the oesophagus, shewing its coats greatly thickened. cc. The cartilaginous or scirrhous thickening of, and between the coats of, the oesophagus, forming a kind of tumour, which closed up the canal of the gullet so as to admit only an ordinary sized urethra bou- gie down this tube.

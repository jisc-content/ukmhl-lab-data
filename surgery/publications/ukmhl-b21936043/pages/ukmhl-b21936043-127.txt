117 TO BE DEALT WITH ON THE SPOT. it probable that, on the side of the head, it would be always neccessary to cut out bloody tumours, whose pulsation or active character had either been stopped, or greatly subdued, by ligatures on the surrounding trunks. For, from what I have seen of the treatment of naevi, (the more feeble character of which resembles the aneurism by anastamosis, or throbbing bloody tu- mour, when this last has been deprived of its vigour by ligatures, perhaps a mere thrill only being left,) it is probable that well directed pressure upon a bony surface, would be capable of effecting the obliterating process upon the remnant of the disease. Of the mode of applying this pressure see the note Naevus. In very large pulsating tumours on the side of the head, with nume- rous trunks, the difficulty of securing them all would be great, and almost insurmountable; but an attempt, perhaps, would be preferable to the risk of tying the common carotid ; a measure always accompanied by some risk, and which, it is now well known, does not always succeed in depriving the tumour of blood, though it appears to be capable of controlling the violence of the current through it. The experience of some recent fatal cases will probably induce more caution and deliberation, before this vessel is taken up on the score of every pulsating tumour of the head. Between the ligature and the disease, the collaterals, so numerous on this part, may creep in, and spoil all,—and then there is the risk of the operation into the bargain. The practice of tying the common carotid on such occasions savours more of the dissecting-room than the surgery, and is an erroneous application of the Hunterian opera- tion for the cure of common popliteal aneurism, and which is daily carried into practice, with equal impropriety, in the treatment of wounded arteries, by tying the trunk at a distance from the wounded branch. If a ligature on the carotid, for a pulsating tumour on the head, does not always stop the blood from reaching it, in consequence of the active influence of collateral branches,—so, on the same ground, the wounded branch or branches will continue to bleed frequently, from anastamosis, when the trunk of the ves- sel is tied, and which will require a ligature on both its wounded extremities to be perfectly safe. In a similar manner pulsating tumours on the head must be dealt with, if possible, on the spot; at once boldly by excision, or by ligature and sub- sequent compression, rather than relying solely upon the closed carotid,—•

110 LITH0T03IY A SAFE OPERATION, IF PROPERLY DONE. discharge from the wound, made by the operation, very small; though the urine has passed through the external wounds occasionally, above the pubes, where the abscesses burst, in three points, and where it causes a slight smarting pain. Discharged cured." The foregoing cases may assist in warning us generally against vio- lence, and particularly from a rough treatment of the bladder, whether practised in the preliminary act of sounding for a stone, or in the operation of extracting it,—that a gentle method is especially necessary in young child- ren, as they bear not severe injuries with impunity,^—that an over-anxiety to possess a fragment of a stone, or an entire one sacculated, either tempo- rally or permanently, leads to irreparable mischief,—^that above the pubes a stone may reside with safety, and without inconvenience, in a sacculated or motionless state:—and, finally, to avoid the imminent dangers of a large stone, in the lateral operation, the surgeon should make it an invariable rule to ascertain its size before operation, that a judgment might be formed as to the necessity of the high one above the pubes, or the median section below their arch. The danger from hemorrhage can hardly be very great, since a fatal case was never known to happen in the whole course of my observation. One, however, whose experience has been far greater than mine, says that he has know n patients lost repeatedly from that cause. Whenever it does happen that hemorrhage from lithotomy destroys life,— a fact to be granted upon the report of such undeniable authority,—this unfortunate occurrence must arise from the knife or gorget acting too near the ramus ischii, an er- ror which a surgeon of cool tact and experience would hardly allow himself to commit. A movement of the handle of the staff, towards the left groin, will carry the curve of the instrument, with the prostate, somewhat further from the ramus of the left ischium; and now if the gorget, (by far the safest instrument, for it cuts with precision,) is impelled forwards, with its edge inclined obliquely outwards, and downwards, the pudic artery itself is as safe as its neighbour on the opposite side the road. Should the size of the calculus be not so very great as to forbid the ope- ration below the arch of the pubes, (a circumstance itself of very rare occur- rence,) and all the necessary circumstances and rules are observed by an perienced lithotomist, — especially those concerning gentleness in execu- tion,—cutting for the stone, in cases proper for the operation, is probably as safe to tlie patient, as a common amputation of the lower extremity.

56 PROLAPSUS, WITH A BAD STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. It is a fact, however, well worth knowing; for should a stricture exist, as the cause of the prolapsus, it would be useless to attempt its cure before the stricture was removed. The patient would undergo a painful operation to no good purpose, and the operation itself, with the operator, would ac- quire no credit. CASE VI. Prolapsus ani conjoined with stricture of the rectum^ which produced it. Miss , about twenty-five years of age, consulted me respecting what she called piles, with which she had been afflicted for nine or ten years, and for which she had medical advice during the whole of that period. She was emaciated, and, from long suffering, in a state of great nervous excitement. She, however, detailed her sufferings with so much accuracy and force, that, without an examination, I took leave to say that I suspected her disorder to be a falling down of the gut. Something, she said, came down after every evacuation, but would return into the body by lying on the bed for an hour or two. But she described other symptoms, not common to a prolapse of the bowel. After the bowel had regained the pelvis, burning pain occurred, and con- tinued about the anus, and along the lower part of the back. She could not walk, indeed she had not walked for two years, for when this exercise was attempted, the bowel descended; so that, between the pains endured after every evacuation, and that which followed occasional descents from stand- ing, she was rarely easy, and this accounted for her worn and distressed appearance. Her stools were passed with great difficulty, (excepting when taking aperients,) and were remarkably small, resembling worms. Her sister died of a diseased rectum. Upon a view of the anus when the patient was standing, there was on its right side, a large fold of the inner membrane of the gut presenting itself, which she said was not at all equal in bulk to that which followed an evacuation.

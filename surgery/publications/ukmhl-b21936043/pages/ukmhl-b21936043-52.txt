42 REMARKS ON THE TREATMENT. then the analogy of structure is so close and undeniable with the urethra, that the most sceptical mind must be satisfied with the wide evidence fur- nished by it, and would not scruple to derive rules of practice therefrom for the oesophagus, which enables him so boldly and successfully to treat the urethra. The instrument for the one, however, requires infinitely more care in the construction, and caution in its employment. Life is at stake in the treatment of the G3sophagus—a false movement is fatal. Minor evils, for the most part, are the results of error in our treatment of the urethra. It is now thirty-two years since I entered the wards of the Gloucester Infirmary, as a pupil. It is a large hospital. But such is the rarity of real, or permanent obstructions of the gullet, that in hospital and private prac- tice combined, I cannot satisfactorily make out a list of more than fourteen cases, which occurred during the whole of that long period. The majority of these were treated medically—^they perished Others were treated with the pointed bougie, simple, or armed—I fear this treatment was equally unsuccessful. Where opportunities occurred, in these last cases, of inspec- tion after death, false passages, or openings through the substance of the tube, were generally discovered, which either killed the patient outright, or accelerated his fate. Preserve me, therefore, from the bougie which is to dilate or force this kind of stricture with its point! Let its use be ever so skilfully conducted—the surgeon ever so remarka- ble for his knowledge—coolness—^delicacy—decision, and manual dexterity, rare combinations indeed! still would I not suffer him to approach my per- son, had I a stricture of the oesophagus, armed with a bougie to act from its point. To escape from so dangerous an individual, would be the first and rational impulse of the mind, for man clings to life instinctively, even when he knows it to be burthensome.

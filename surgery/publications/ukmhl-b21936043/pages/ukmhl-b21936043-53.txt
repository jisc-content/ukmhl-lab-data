43 ON THE FALLING DOWN OF THE BOWEL. NOTE III. PROLAPSUS ANI. On the falling down of the Bowel in grown Persons.

This weakness of the sphincter may itself arise from irritations within the bowels, of which class of causes, purgatives, used immoderately, is a frequent one, by the incessant action, and consequent relaxation they in- duce in this muscle, which, in time, becomes so weakened, as to be utterly incapable of performing its office, of guardian to this important outlet of the body. To such an extent is its loss of power carried, that the falling down of the bowel, at first occurring only when the patient strained at stool, will take place on his rising upon his feet, the sphincter obeying not the will, but yielding, without resistance, to the incvimbent weight, and the protrusion takes place. Until the time of Mr. Hey, the chronic prolapsus of adults, so teazing, and destructive of all comfort, was without a remedy. Confounded with piles, (which are themselves confounded with every ailment about the anus) it obtained temporary relief from fomentations and ointments, appropriated to that complaint, and the gut was now and then, under this delusion, re- placed in its proper situation by the patient, or the remaining vigour of the sphincter.

SPASM OF THE GLOTTIS. 2 Some eminent men have ventured to believe, that the process of suffo- cation from affections of the throat, is often effected by the spasmodic ac- tions of the muscles of the glottis; and cases are recorded, and others will here follow, in which, evidence enough can be found, to render this a fair, and reasonable conclusion. This evidence consists in the undeniable fact, that in many of those cases of sudden death from suffocation, or an obstruc- ted windpipe, no obstruction of a mechanical kind, either within that tube, or on its outside, can be discovered; whilst on the other, we know that the rima glottidis is surrounded by muscles; and that such muscles are capable of violent, and convulsive actions, upon the application of irritants, which actions are also capable of closing the tube, sufficiently long to extinguish life. The spasm of the glottis, is probably of the same character as those which affect the urethra, oesophagus, and the rectum; and which are called spasmodic strictures, and like these, that of the glottis is a sympathetic af- fection, derived from an original disease, more or less distant. The last object of our enquiry, is a knowledge of those peculiar origi- nal affections, which sometimes so fatally controul the actions of the most important and interesting canal Of the human body ; for when known to us, early and vigorous measures will frequently save the unfortunate patient, from the horrors of sudden death by suffocation. By discovering the cause, we are more likely to remove the effect. The spasmodic stricture of the glottis, varies in its degree, and duration : the highest degree must cpiickly prove fatal, no air being able to gain a passage through the rima glottidis, as we sometimes see in the spasmodic stricture of the urethra, which will scarcely allow a drop of urine to pass beyond it; at other times, the degree of spasm is moderate and will last a considerable time, frequently observed in slight convulsive catches of the breath, alternating and connected with more regular difficulty of breathing, produced in some cases by pressure on the larynx, and diseases within that canal. The spasm of the glottis, is not accompanied by fever, vuiless this is caused by any of the inflammatory affections which may excite the spasm it- self, as cynanche tonsillaris, laryngea, and trachealis, the croup of children, or phlegmonous abscesses on the outside the larynx. From the rarity of the spasm of the glottis, but more especially from its having most fre-

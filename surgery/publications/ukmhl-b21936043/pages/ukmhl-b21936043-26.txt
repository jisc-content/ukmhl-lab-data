SPASMODIC STRICTURE OF THE GLOTTIS. 16 there was thirst, with sonie cough, and he brought up, occasionally, a quan- tity of mucus. He had been a good deal exposed of late to the night air, in his practice of an accoucheur, had been ill about two days with soreness of the throat in swallowing, and some difficulty of breathing, and fever, but nothing in degree to what he now suffered. He referred all his distress to the larynx, where he placed his finger; he complained of pain there, but especially of a sensation like the drawing of a purse-string, to close the channel of the purse: "but," said he, characteristically, in a croaking, broken voice, " I suppose the string is not yet drawn very tight, when it is, I shall be no more." As the fauces indicated no inflammation, and but very little redness, and that only visible when the tongue was well kept down on the lower part of the back of the pharynx, and as the boundaries of the neck were free of all irritations which might affect the glottis sympathetically, and as the patient had taken cold, had cough, and symptoms of fever, together with a regular difficulty of breathing, independant of all spasms, and also expectoration of mucus, I ventured to believe, (more especially as he com- plained of regular pain under the thyroid cartilage,) that this was a case of inflammation of the mucous lining of the larynx, and perhaps of the lower portions of the pharynx, which excited the spasmodic action of the muscles. He was bled largely from the arm, and forty leeches were applied as nearly as possible about the thyroid cartilage, to the spot where he complained of pain. Under these active means the symptoms gradually faded. He retained his daughter however for a long time to prevent his sleeping, a painful and self-denying resolution for an exhausted man, only to be accounted for, from the deep impression made on his memory by the suffiacating nature of the spasm, Avhich seized him during sleep. To this day the impression of terror is as fresh as ever in this gentle- man's memory; the fear of taking cold, and of a return of the attack is constant, and in consequence I believe he retired from his business as an eminent accoucheur.

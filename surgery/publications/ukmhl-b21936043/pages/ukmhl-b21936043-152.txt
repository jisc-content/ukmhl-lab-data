DEFORMITY FROM A BURN. 142 Anne Jones is given, in addition to some others now on record, at the time of the operation, and subsequent to its performance. The operation consisted in a free removal of the old cicatrix, laying the redundant flaps transversely across the throat, and raising the chin con- siderably above the horizontal line. Straps secured the flaps of skin, and - an unyielding mattrass, with a well padded collar, sustained the chin most correctly. Great and unwearied attention,—from an intelligent pupil,— accomplished the cure, as it is now seen, which is a period of five years from the date of the operation. It is, probably, the want of the necessary minute and constant atten- tion to keep the chin well above the horizontal line, for the whole period of healing, which has caused the failures in this operation. No collar was worn in this case, nor has any contraction taken place subsequent to the healing of the sore. The chin is as far from the spot of its former union with the breast, as it was immediately after the closure of the wound; the chin, however, cannot be raised above its position marked in the print, on account of a perpendicular line of skin which interrupts the motion of that part upwards.

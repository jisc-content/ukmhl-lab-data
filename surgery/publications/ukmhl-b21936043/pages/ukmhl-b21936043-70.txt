FROliAPSVS ANI FROM STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM, 60 It is true that he might not have supposed that stricture of the gut could effect the propulsion of its loose folds through the sphincter. He might, or might not have conceived, that the purgatives to which she had been accustomed had weakened the sphincter, and he sought no further. The contraction of the bowel, through the medium of the several in- struments employed, gives a sensation of roughness and hardness ; the last quality equal to that of cartilage or schirrus ; but this lady has not the look or constitutional character of the last affection; neither is there any dis- charge from the gut. But this case, when offered to his notice, possessed the symptoms of a stricture of the rectum, independent of the falling down of it, and as the cure of the latter could not be effected whilst the former existed, it would have been right not to have overlooked such symptoms, by the discovery of which an useless and painful operation might have been prevented, and which would also have led to the proper steps for the relief of the original affection, the stricture itself. CASE VIII. Prolapsus Ani, produced hy Stricture of the Rectum, cured for a time hy operation; hut the stricture having been overlooked, a Procidentia folloived, with Fistula in Ano. A lady about fifty years of age, the mother of many children, had un- dergone the operation for prolapsus ani, performed by excision, which suc- ceeded very well, for a time, in keeping the gut in its place; but she soon discovered that a difficulty, which she always had in passing her evacuations, remained, indeed it was rather increased; and to this was added very con- siderable pain, and a feeling like that of protrusion, to which she had been accustomed before the operation. Neither herself nor her maid, however, could distinguish any external appearance of the gut protruded, as formerly, at the anus. After a time a swelling took place by the side of the anus, which her medical attendant described, by letter, as an abscess, and my attendance was requested.

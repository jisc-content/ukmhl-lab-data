19 REMARKS, OBSERVATIONS. It will be seen in the foregoing cases that the stricture of the glottis, the effects of irregular actions of its muscles, and which terminated in many of them in instant death, was produced by this interesting and im- portant canal, sympathizing with the following distinct affections, more or less distant from itself. 1. From the irritation of acute inflammation of the mucous mem- brane of the fauces where it covers the tonsils, velum pendulum palati, and tonsils, (cynanche tonsillaris.) 2. The irritation of the rare, acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the larynx, (laryngitis) and lower down the trachea, (cynanche trachealis,) or croup of children. I never saw but one example of the spasm from this last cause, and of this no note was taken. The child was suffocated before bronchotomy could be performed. 3. The irritation of an irritable bronchocele. 4. From the irritation of an ulcer in the oesophagus. 5. The mere handling and leeching an irritable l)ronchocele. 6. The irritation of a scrophulous abscess of the pharynx. 7. The irritation of a phlegmonous abscess of the neck. 8. Irritation of a chronic abscess of the pharynx. 9. Of acute phlegmonous abscess of the fauces. 10. Chronic enlargement of the tonsils, when inflamed and increased in size by taking cold, as in sore throats. 11. Venereal ulcer of the throat. 12. Elongation of the uvula. It is probable that the degree and duration of the spasm of the glottis, in many instances depend upon the quality of the primary irritation, and the seat of its application, more especially extraordinary sensibility of sur- face, which itself may be influenced by the condition of the stomach. Thus some substances taken into this organ at one period will produce head-ache, whilst at others they will not.

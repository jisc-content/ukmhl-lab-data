HEMORRHAGE AFTER OPERATION FOR THE PROLAPSUS ANI. 49 CASE II. Prolapsus Ani, with the power of the Sphincter extinct. The operation for which was followed hy a bleeding, which nearly proved fatal. The lady of a military man of rank, living at a fashionable watering place, consulted me, by the advice of her physician, for a falling down of the bowel of an immense size, and which was almost constantly prolap- sed, as even standing for a moment would effect its descent. The lady was old, and of a very relaxed habit. The protruded part was replaced easily, and the clenched fist would, with equal ease, have fol- lowed through a sphincter which had no trace of the power of contraction left.

About two hours afterwards, I was sent for in hasteâ€”she was said to be bleeding to death. Though cautious in taking the necessary steps to prevent, secondary hemorrhage, yet was the surprise at the spectacle before H

66 ENTEROCELE IN THE SAC OF EPIPLOCELE. CYSTOCELE BEHIND. NOTE V. SOME ANOMALIES OF STRANGULATED HERNIA, ENCOUNTERED IN OPERATION. CASE L An Enterocele, ivitJi its sac contained in the sac of an Epiplocele. Behind these a Cystocele. The sac of one rupture containing the sac of another is a very un- common case, since one of our most distinguished writers on hernia, and most experienced of surgeons, never met with one. Faithful reports of such irregularities are valuable, by preparing the young surgeon for them when they do occur—in preventing confusion of his conduct, when all depends upon his coolness and knowledge. On the night of the 4th of August, 1822, a young medical friend called me to his father, who had an old, and very large, scrotal, irreducible hernia, now become strangulated, with an increase of bulk, in which state it had been for some days. Although in such cases there is no great urgency, yet this delay was probably sufficiently long, as the symptoms were unmitigated by the pru- dent measures which had been employed. He vomited occasionally; nothing had passed his bowels of any con- sequence, and that little was probably from the portion of them below the obstruction :—-there was hiccough now and then—the abdomen began to swell, and it was becoming tender upon pressure. No further time was lost. On opening the sac, which appeared thinner than could be expected in so aged a hernia, a mass of omentum was discovered, adherent to the generality of its surface by broad and firm bands, evidently of long standing. Some adhesions of a more tender structure connected the omentum, at the

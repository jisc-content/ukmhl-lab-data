63 PROLAPSUS ANI FROM STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. depressed state of her mind, which has been harassed with constant appre- hensions of evil since the prolapsus made its appearance some months ago. She is desired to live upon light and farinaceous diet, and to have the rectum cleared in preparation for my next visit. March 4. This is certainly a firm and serious obstruction in the bow- el, but as it is without pain of a lancinating nature, or bloody discharge, it is probably not malignant. Large bougies will not enter the stricture, the small ones bend against it and are turned backwards. I am in doubt whether a small instrument passes or not. Writers on stricture of the rectum may have mentioned prolapsus as an occasional effect of it. But I do not remember any writer on the pro- lapsus ani itself who has considered stricture as one of its causes, and thence derived a rule to examine the whole extent of the bowel, previous to any operation for the cure of the first affection. Perhaps none of the minor operations of surgery require more tact and experience than this examination of the whole course of the rectum with the bougie. The natural obstructions in the canal are many, and may be still more numerous from disease and other circumstances; and such diffi- culties can only be met successfully by a knowledge of the anatomy, natu- ral and morbid. The angles made by the bowel itself, the projection of the sacrum, an enlarged or retro verted uterus, or prostate gland, a spasmodic stricture, or hardened faeces, are all to be taken into consideration, and well remembered by the surgeon, otherwise he may take some of these ob- structions to the passage of the bougie for a stricture, when, in reality, no such affection exists. The character of the bougie itself may increase the difficulties. If it be too small, or too soft, these natural obstructions to its route will turn back the point, and leave it curved in the bowel, thus confirming the original error.

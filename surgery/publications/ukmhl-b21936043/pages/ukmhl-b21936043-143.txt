133 ANOMALIES OF ENCYSTED HYDROCELE. and that the indentation over the centre of the general tumour, was nothing more than the natural boundary which marked their separate extent, I did not hesitate to make an opening into the superior or firm one, which appear- ed to be an encysted hydrocele of the cord, from which escaped a consider- able quantity of bloody-looking serum. The inferior swelling remained but little affected by the reduction of the superior; and an examination with the finger, through the opening made by the knife, clearly ascertained that no testis was contained in its thick cavity, but that it was below in the tu- nica vaginalis, and, from its superficial and prominent situation, undoubt- edly adherent to the front of it. By holding the apex or upper portion of this remaining swelling in one hand, and striking its base with the other, a fluctuation was very per- ceptible. The cavity of the encysted hydrocele was washed out with port wine, and a piece of lint, slightly moistened with the same, was thrust into it. The object of this proceeding was a double one,— to inflame the cyst, that it mighl; be closed by the adhesive process, and to ascertain how far the severe inflammation I expected, would induce absorption of the fluid in the neighbouring tunica vaginalis. Great inflammation did come on, and an abscess was the result, with considerable fever; but the whole affection,—the encysted hydrocele, and that of the tunica vaginalis,—was cured by it. This case may serve to shew the necessity of repeated and careful manipulations, where there are double-looking tumours of the scrotum, and especially with a greater weight than is common to hydrocele. CASE IV. Eiicysled Hydrocele of the cord, which ivould pass through the abdominal ring, and hence was mistaken for a rupture. A lad, about fifteen years of age, was brought to the hospital by a truss-maker, with a tumour of the scrotum. An apothecary had seen him.

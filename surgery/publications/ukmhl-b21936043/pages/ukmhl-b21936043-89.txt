Lithontrity may, by being successful in the treatment of small calculi, diminish the frequency of lithotomy, but it will never supersede this ope- ration altogether. Its difficulties, irregularities and failures, will, therefore, still be objects of interest, and worthy of collecting. In performing the operation of lithotomy, it is, perhaps, too much the fashion to consider rapidity of execution as a leading excellence; but in our attempts to acquire this captivating dexterity, there is reason to fear that mischief is sometimes done—because hurried and showy movements are scarcely compatible with the gentleness and caution which are neces- sary to success. The fatality of lithotomy cases recorded in the Journals, may, in a great degree, be ascribed to these attempts at brilliant practice; of counting the number of minutes Mr. , of great celebrity, takes, to perform this operation; a dangerous guide, for, without his constant practice, none can be equally rapid, with safety to the patient! "That operation is done quick enough, which is well done, " said one of the best surgeons of our days. If rapidity be to save pain, it fails in its object, for severity of suffering, from violence of the movements, is more than a balance for a more moderate degree longer continued. The first incisions may indeed be as quick as the surgeon may please, but, when the membranous portion of the urethra is to be carefully cut, just before the prostrate gland, the gland itself, and the forceps^—the too often terrible forceps—used, it is humbly conceived that the operator

10 SPASM OP THE GLOTTIS. CASE VI. Cynanche Tonsillaris ivitli abscess, exciting spasm of the Glottis. May, 1829. Mr. S â–  of Ashlevvorth came to Gloucester in great haste, begging me to accompany him to his brother, whom he was fearful would be suffocated before our arrival. The patient was semi-recumbent on his bed, exhausted by some se- vere previous suffering, breathing noisily, though evidently through the nose. The history of his case I was now to hear. He had had a sore throat for four days, and had been attended by a medical friend of mine, who lived in the neighbourhood, and by whom he had been bled and blistered; but that he received no relief from these means, and for the last two days he could neither speak nor swallow. But the circumstance which had created so much alarm, as to induce him to send for me, was a sudden attack of violent, convnlsive difficulty of breathing, which had threatened strangulation, and which had ceased a short time only before I entered the bed-room. The fauces of Mr. S. were swollen to an unusual degree, the velum pendvdum palati, and the tonsils, appeared to have advanced into the mouth, forming a complete barrier, and closing entirely the communication between the latter and the pharynx, whilst a slight undulating line Could be scarcely traced marking the boundaries of the tonsils, as they rested heavily on each other. He was breathing hard, but not spasmodically. There was a slight bulging of the velum pendulum palati just above the right tonsil, into which I plunged the pharyngotomos, and a torrent of pus was poured upon the floor. Shortening the lancet, the tonsils and velum were scarified freely, and after washing his mouth he spoke freely, and re- quested food. I saw Mr. S. no more. He recovered, though slowly, from a state of great exhaustion, spitting up daily, as reported, great quantities of mucus.

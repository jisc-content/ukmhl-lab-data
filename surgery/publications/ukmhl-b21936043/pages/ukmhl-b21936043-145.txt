In recording a case of this kind, Dupuytren relates two examples of hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, which were operated upon in a Parisian hospital, and, in consequence of the communication with the abdomen being open, the stimulating injection passed into the peritoneum. One of these patients died of peritonitis :â€”the other escaped. The relation of such a fact as the foregoing must lead to a belief, that where any doubt exists, in a case of supposed hydrocele of the spermatic cord, as to its real nature, that carefully opening the tumour by incision, in the horizontal manner practised in strangulated hernia, would be the safest mode of cure. Its true nature would thus be revealed, and an opportuni- ty afforded, on the escape of the fluid, to ascertain with the finger whether any outlet existed at any point of the cyst. Inflammation enough to close this cyst might then be excited by the insertion of a foreign body.

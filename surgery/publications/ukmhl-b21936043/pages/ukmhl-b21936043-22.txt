SPASM OF THE GLOTTIS FROM A VENEREAL ULCER. 12 "March 11. The nurse says, that in the night the girl has had several attacks of great difficulty of breathing, which, however, subsided on her rising in bed. " This morning, since the action of the means employed, she is un- questionably better. The redness of the fauces, and the tenderness of the tonsils, the pain about the head and neck, are all gone, and the tonsils are greatly diminished in size." The active inflammation being thus removed, with the additional bulk of tonsil, their combined irritation no longer excited the dangerous action of the muscles of the larynx. Henceforward her nights were no longer disturbed by suffocating starts, nor the neighbouring patients terrified by witnessing so novel and alarming a scene. CASE VIII. Suffocation from a Venereal Ulcer in the Throat, exciting the Glottis. Joy, appeared at the Public Surgery, requesting advice, as he said, for a sore throat. His voice was an unnatural deep growl, and he spoke of a great difficulty in swallowing, and sometimes of breathing, espe- cially when he lay in bed. His breathing was of that kind as though he spoke with uneasiness and reluctance, and every now and then a word was not articulated, or but indistinctly. His breath was exceedingly offensive. There was no visible disease in his throat, though he remarked that he frequently expectorated, after much exertion, thick matter sometimes mix- ed with blood. On enquiry, I found that he had had sores on his penis, and buboes, with- in the last few months, which healed, whilst the mouth was sore from mercury. A bubo had closed recently; there was still an ulcer on his head. I explained to him that I considered his case one of great danger, of suffocation frOm an ulcer he had deep in his throat, which could not be seen, that he might have occasion to undergo an operation to prevent the fatal event, and that, therefore, he had better obtain a letter of recommend- ation to the Infirmary.

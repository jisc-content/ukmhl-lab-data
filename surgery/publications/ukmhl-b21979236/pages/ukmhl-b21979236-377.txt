237 M. OPENING THE CAVITY OF THE CHEST. PARACENTESIS THORACIS. 1. When, after penetrating wounds of the chest, an accumulation of air and fluid in the pleural cavity can be diagnosed by physical examination (pyopneumothorax and haemo-pneumothorax), and from the accompanying symptoms (high fever, offensive discharge) an inference drawn, that decomposition (septic) of the contents has taken place; or if distressing symptoms of asphyxia are produced by the increased intra-thoracic pressure, then there should be no delay in providing a sufficient outlet for the accumulated pus by a icicle opening from the chest. 2. In many cases the icound already existing may first off all be enlarged, by incising the skin from the wound on both sides in the direction of the intercostal space, far enough to allow the finger to enter the cavity of the chest. If there is any difficulty, the intercostal muscles are separated with forceps. 3. If loose splinters of bone, bullets, or other foreign bodies are met with, they are immediately carefully extracted. The wound can undoubtedly be made more accessible by the subperiosteal excision of a piece of the fractured rib. 4. When the outlet is sufficiently free, an endeavour is made first of all, by thoroughly washing out the cavity with an irrigator, which is filled with tepid desinfectant water, to clear out the accu- mulated secretion, and any foreign bodies, that may be present (pieces of cloth etc.). 5. Forcing air in by means of a syringe and rolling the patient on to his side, so that the opening is dependant (both recommended by Roser), render very essential service. 6. One or more strong drainage tubes are passed into the cavity of the chest, and their ends fastened to the surrounding skin by silk thread or silver wire. 7. The drainage tubes must not be hermetically closed. They are covered either with a large quantity of charpie or jute, in which the secretions are discharged, or the patient is made to assume such a

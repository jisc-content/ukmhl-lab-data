The abdominal wound is also closed with sutures. 0. URETHROTOMY AND LITHOTOMY. 1. Opening the urethra from the perinaeum is urgently called for (Boutonnikre, external urethrotomy), when the urethra is injured (con- tused or ruptured), and dangerous urinary extravasation threatens or is already present. 2. A grooved staff or a catheter is passed into the bladder; or if that is impossible it is passed as far as the seat of injury, and held firmly there by an assistant exactly in the middle line. 3. The patient is placed upon his back at the edge of the operating table, with his legs widely separated (lithotomy position). 4. The scrotum is raised, and the left index finger intro- duced within the anus to act as a guide; an incision is then made, 3â€”4cni in length, accurately in the middle Jim' (raphe) between the anus and the scro- tum. By carefully re- peating the incisions, the deeper structu- res are reached and the groove of the staff exposed (fig. 529). Fig. 529.

16 G. THE UNION OF WOUNDS. To unite the edges of wounds, which have no tendency to slough (incisions and incised wounds), we make use of: 1. Strips of adhesive Plaster; they are on the whole seldom used, because the plaster easily irritates the skin, producing erythema and eczema, and causes the retention of the secretions of the wound. 2. Strips of gauze-bandage, which are fastened on both sides of the wound with collodion (gun-cotton dissolved in ether) or with gutta- percha dissolved in chloroform. 3. Starch - bandage, dipped in water and applied over the edges of the wound, which are adapted by the fingers, presses the edges well together without keeping back the secretions of the wound. In many cases it is better to roll up the bandage from both ends, and with it to press the edges of the wound together from both sides (fig. 20). Double-headed roller. ° K ° Fig. 20. Sutures, a.

It is important to finish the stitch with a safe double knot, which does not of itself become loose. For this purpose the reef knot (fig. 22) is used in which the threads pass respectively beneath and above the • corresponding loops, while in the false knot or "granny" (fig. 23) which is not secure, the threads on each side pass one above The interrupted suture. an<J the Other below the loop. i—±&

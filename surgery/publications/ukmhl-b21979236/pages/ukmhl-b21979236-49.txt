29 2. PASTE-BOARD SPLINTS. a. Splints of thick paste-board can be easily cut to any shape with a sharp knife. They adapt themselves well to the body, when moistened, and bandaged on with a gauze roller, but they give no solid support till they have become dry. They also easily become soft again by contact with blood, secretions from the wound, rain, or any other moisture. They are especially used in the starch bandage. b. Prepared paste-board splints, made of softened paste-board, which are dried on models of arms and legs and" varnished, are light and fit well, i. e. if a sufficient variety of sizes are kept in stock to choose from. Merchie's double-shelled splints (fig. 47â€”50) have been intro- duced into the Belgian army.* Ports plaster of Paris splints in three Fig. 47.

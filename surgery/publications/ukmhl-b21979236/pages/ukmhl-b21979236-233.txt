\67 Note. Whipped blood can be kept for 24 hours in a well covered vessel, sur- rounded with ice, but before the transfusion it must be heated by placing it in warm water at 360 centigrade (970 Fahrenheit), and saturated with oxygen by repeatedly drawing it in and out of a syringe. 5. Meanwhile on the patient, a subcutaneous vein (e. g. the median basilic at the elbow, or the internal saphenous in trout of the internal malleolus) is exposed by incising a fold of skin, and sufficiently isolated to allow two catgut ligatures to be drawn beneath it. 6. The distal part of the vein is tied with one ligature; the other ligature is pushed beneath the proximal portion. 7. The exposed vein is opened by raising the upper wall with a tine pair of toothed forceps, beneath which an oblique slit is Fi8- 29L made with a pair of scissors, so that a small flap-like wound is produced. 8. A canule rounded at the point (of glass, vul- canite or sil- ver) is push- ed into the central part of the vein, by raising the Hap. and causing the wound in the vein to gape. The canule is fastened with the se- cond catgut S^y=r-~'^''^ thread (fig. ^"^^ 201^ V- Introduction of the canule.

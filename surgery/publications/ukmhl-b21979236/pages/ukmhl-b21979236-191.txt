VA Plate X. Ligature of the brachial artery at the right elbow (art. anconea). 1. The cutaneous incision is made 3cm m length, and 5mm to the inner side of the tendon of the biceps; carefully, so as not to injure the median vein, which is drawn downwards. 2. The bicipital fascia is divided. Immediately beneath it is the artery, lying upon the brachialis anticus and between its venae comites. The median nerve lies a few millimetres further inwards, and passes beneath the pronator radii teres.

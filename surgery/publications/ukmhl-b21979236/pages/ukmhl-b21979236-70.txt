The two corners are then carried backwards above the ears, made to cross one another on the occiput, brought back again to the front, and tied together on the forehead. Finally the point, which hangs down behind, is tightly drawn downwards, then turned upwards over the occipul, and fastened upon the vertex with a safety pin. b. The four-tailed cap (fig. 94 and 95), is a square handkerchief 60cm long, 20cra broad, which is slit from both its narrow ends. If you wish to fix a- dressing on the vertex, the two posterior corners or tails are tied together under the chin, and the two anterior on the nape of the neck (fig. 94). But if the dressing is to be kept on the occiput, the anterior corners are tied together under the chin, and the two posterior on the forehead (fig. 95). Fig. 91.

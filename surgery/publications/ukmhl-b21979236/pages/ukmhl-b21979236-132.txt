II. OPERATIONS. A. CHLOROFORM NARCOSIS. 1. During every great operation, as well as in long and painful examinations, the patient should be rendered insensible by chloroform inhalation (Simpson 1847). 2. As this wonderful condition can not always be free from danger, certain precautions in its administration must be observed. 3. A person about to take chloroform should be fasting (taking no nourishment for three or four hours previously). During the operation he should lie on his back or side, not on the abdomen, because the respiration is thereby interfered with: and he should not sit up, as in this way faintness readily occurs: most of the fatal cases have taken place during trifling operations, in which the patient has been in a sitting posture. 4. All constriction should be removed by opening the dress, so that the neck and chest may be exposed, and the abdomen readily accessible. 5. Whilst the chloroform is being administered, the pulse and respi- ration should be under constant observation. (If a sufficient number of assistants be present, the one, who gives the chloroform, should be responsible for the respiration, the two, who hold the arms, should watch the pulse.) 6. The inhaled vapour of chloroform should be largely mixed with air. Covering the mouth and nose with a sponge or cloth, saturated with chloroform, is dangerous. A wire frame covered with flannel, on Avhich the chloroform is poured drop by drop, is much more con- venient, e. g., Skinner's apparatus, simplified by the author (fig. 241), can be easily packed in a leather case, together with tongue forceps and drop bottle, and carried in the pocket. With each inhalation

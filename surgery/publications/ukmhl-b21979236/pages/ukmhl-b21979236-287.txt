6. With the edge of the knife carried over the line of articulation Disarticulation through the tarsus fCHOPARTj. Fig. 378. 5. The small dorsal flap is forcibly retracted, unci by one stroke of the knife all the tendons are divided and the joints immediately opened (it is safest to begin over the tuberosity of the scaphoid as it can be planily felt). slightly curved in o^shape, the joints open with a cracking noise. The point divides every band that is on the stretch, till finally on the plantar aspect the anterior part of the foot can be so completely flexed as to touch the heel. 7. After the incision for the plantar flap has been deepened, the blade of the knife with the edge directed forwards is placed beneath the libe- rated scaphoid and cu- boid bones, and carried forwards in a sawing mo- tion, till the plantar flap is completed (fig. 378). 8. Fig. 379 shews the appearance of the stump. Fig. 379. 1 (Completing the plantar flap.) Stump after CHOPART'S operation.

Plate XIV. Ligature of the external iliac artery (right). 1. The cutaneous incision, which is lcni above and parallel to Poupart's ligament, 8â€”10cm in length, and slightly convex, begins 3CU1 to the inner side of the anterior superior spine, and ends opposite to the internal inguinal ring (without exposing the ring or the sper- matic cord). 2. The subcutaneous tissue, the thin superficial fascia, the strong tendinous aponeurosis of the external oblique, and the muscular fibres of the internal oblique are divided; then the horizontal muscular fibres of the transversalis in the outre angle of the wound. 3. The thin subjacent fascia transversalis must be carefully divided. (In fat subjects there is still a thin layer of fat.) 4. The peritoneum is carefully pressed towards the umbilicus with the fingers bent like a hook (NB. without stripping up the fascia iliaca from the wall of the pelvis and with it the artery). 5. The artery lies in contact with the inner border of the psoas; to its inner side is the vein; to the outer side the anterior crural nerve covered by the iliac fascia; the genital branch of the genito- crural nerve crosses the artery obliquely.

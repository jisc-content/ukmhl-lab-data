279 (antiseptic dressings, immobilisation, extension, ice), in severe cases by primary excision. If in spite of the conservative treatment, a dan- gerous septic suppuration of the injured joint is developed, then secon- dary excision is indicated, if the suppuration has not already extended so far, that only amputation above the joint concerned can save the life of the patient. II. EXCISION OF PORTIONS OF THE CALVARIA. Fig. 497. 1. Excision of portions of the cranial bones may be necessary to" extract splinters of bone or foreign bodies (projectiles, the points of broken swords or knives etc.), which have penetrated into the dura mater and brain, to thoroughly cleanse and render aseptic recent com- pound fractures of the skull, and finally to provide an escape for pus in the cranial cavity collected either upon or beneath the dura mater. 2. If there is a fractured opening in the skull, and the depressed fragment, as commonly hap- pens, is larger than the outer opening, the latter must be enlarged, for the piece of bone to be raised and ex- tracted. 3. For this purpose Luer's (fig. 497) or Hoffmann's gouge - forceps Biting off the edge of bone in a fracture of the skull with LUER'S gouge-forceps.

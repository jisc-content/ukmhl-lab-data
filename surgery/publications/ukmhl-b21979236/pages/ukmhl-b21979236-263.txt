3. The thumb can now be still more strongly ab- ducted. The knife is taken through the joint on to the radial side of the metn carpal bone, and carried downwards again upon it, forming a radial flap, whose rounded point terminates on a level with the web (fig. 341). e. Disarticulation of the last four metacarpal bones, preserving the thumb. 1. A semilunar flap is described upon the palm of the hand by an obliquely curved incision, which begins at the web of the thumb, and terminates at the ulnar border of the base of the fifth metacarpal bone (fig. 342). The flap can also be made from within outwards by transfixion at its base (fig. 343). Pig. 342. Fig. 343. Palmar incision. Disarticulation of the last tour metacarpal bones. 13*

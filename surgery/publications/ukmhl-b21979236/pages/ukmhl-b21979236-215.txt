Plate XVIII. Ligature of the popliteal artery (right). 1. The cutaneous incision, 8cm in length at the outer border of the semimembranosus, is carried down through the tissues of the popliteal space. 2. The dense fascia and fat are divided, until the internal popliteal nerve (nervus tibialis) is visible. 3. The nerve is drawn outwards; behind it and somewhat to its inner side lies the popliteal vein, which is loosened and drawn outwards; behind the vein and slightly to its inner side lies the artery.

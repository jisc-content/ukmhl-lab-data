*35 16 If there is not a tourniquet at hand, a fad can he improvised in this way. A linen bandage, 8m long and 6- broad, is wound round the middle of a stick, which should be about a foot long, and of the thickness of the thumb. This pad is placed immediately below the umbilicus, and kept in the proper -position by an assistant who has charge of the stick. It is then pressed with some force against the vertebral column by the turns of an india-rubber bandage 6cm in breadth, which is carried 5 â€” 6 times round the body (fig. 275). Fig. 275. 17. If the circular compression of the abdomen is undesirable, the linen bandage is wound upon the middle of a longer stick, and its ends are pressed through the turns of an india-rubber bandage, which is passed beneath the operating table (Brandis) (fig. 276). 18. At the conclusion of the operation the ligature must not he slowly loosened, but quickly removed. The consequent haemorrhage is generally considerable, because the walls of the vessels are paralyzed from the continuous pressure. Haemorrhage must therefore be prevented before the removal of the elastic ligature, either by tying the divided vessel (as in amputations or excisions), or by the application of the tampon to the wound (as in necrosis cases etc.). The parenchymatous haemorrhage, which follows in spite of this treatment, is easily arrested by carbolised ice-water, by the employment of the inducted current to

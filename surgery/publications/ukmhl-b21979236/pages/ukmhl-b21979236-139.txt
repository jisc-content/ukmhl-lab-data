U9 finger cannot well be continued for any length of time, as for example during transport to the hospital, it must be supplied â€” (5. By a pad and bandage, which exercise sufficient pressure upon the wound. But before such a compress is applied, if the part injured be an extremity, the whole limb must first be carefully bandaged (flannel bandage is the best) from below upwards, to prevent the diffuse in- filtration of the cellular tissue with blood (bloody infiltration), which is so dangerous. A firm pad is then placed upon the wound, if possible of antiseptic material (antiseptic balls of salicylic jute fig. 19, or carbolic wadding, carbolic jute, carbolic tinder), and pressed firmly upon it by a tightly drawn bandage. A bandage made from some elastic material is the best (india-rubber, or elastic braces). If the injury in question be that of a large artery, it is safer to apply the tampon to the wound itself, i. e., the middle of a piece of Lister's gauze, or gauze soaked in carbolic oil is pressed with the finger as deeply as possible into the wound, and the cavity filled, after the finger has been withdrawn, first with small, then with larger anti- septic balls, quickly and firmly, till the last overlaps the edges of the wound (fig. 246). These are kept in position by a tightly drawn bandage, if possible an elastic one. On the arrival of the patient at the hospital, the plug must be removed, and the haemorrhage, if it should recur, is at once permanently arrested. Fig. 246. The application of tampon with antiseptic balls. o. Styptics, i. e., remedies, which promote the coagulation of the blood, and the contraction of the walls of the vessels, and also produce a firmly adherent scab, should only be employed as a last resource, when the haemorrhage can not be controlled by the tampon alone.

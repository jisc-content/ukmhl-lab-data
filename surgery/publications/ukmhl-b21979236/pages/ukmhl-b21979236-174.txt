Plate V. Ligature of the lingual artery. 1. The cutaneous incision is 4cm in length along the upper border of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. 2. The platysma is divided; the posterior facial vein is drawn outwards. 3. The posterior belly of the digastric muscle is exposed; behind and below it appears the hypoglossal nerve; the submaxillary gland is drawn upwards. 4. The hypoglossal nei've nuns in front over the hyoglossus muscle, accompanied by the lingual vein; below the nerve and behind the hyo- glossus muscle passes the lingual artery. 5. Between the hypoglossal nerve and the great cornu of the hyoid bone the fibres of the hyoglossus are cautiously divided; immediately beneath this muscle lies the lingual artery, accompanied by a vein. The artery can also be tied in the lingual trigone (Hueter) after the division of the hyoglossus, i. e. between the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle.

293 2. It is most rapidly and easily performed by division of the crico-thyroid ligament (laryngotomy), which is quite sufficient^ if it is only required to avert the danger of instantaneous asphyxia (fig. 517).

If the opening is not large enough, the cricoid cartilage can be divided (crico-tracheotomie). 4. The trachea itself is most conveniently opened above the thyroid body (tracheotomia superior). 5. The opening below the thyroid body (tracheotomia inferior) is more difficult and dangerous, because the trachea is here much more deeply placed, and large abnormal vessels are frequently found running in front of it (arteria anonyma, carotis, thyreoiclea magna; vena jugu- laris media, thyreoitfea magna). 6. Chloroform can be administered very safely for this operation, as long as the patient has not become too much asphyxiated. It essen- tially facilitates the operation, as the movements of the larynx are thereby rendered less violent.

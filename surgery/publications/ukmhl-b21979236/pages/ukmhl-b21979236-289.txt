2\5 2. Both flaps are liberated from the bones, till both lateral sur- . faces of the os calcis and the talo-scaphoid joint are exposed. Great care is taken, in approaching the lower end of the malleoli, not to in- jure the tibio-tarsal joint. 3. The anterior part of the foot is removed by Chopakt's disarti- culation. 4. The anterior end of the os calcis is seized with a pair of bone forceps, and while the borie is being depressed and supinated, the ex- ternal lateral ligaments are divided with a narrow knife 1cm below the tip of the external malleolus. The same knife then penetrates between the two bones and divides the strong interosseous ligament: and by twisting the bone more and more upon its long axis, the talo - calcaneal ligament is finally divided about 3cra below the inner malleolus. (See the representation of the ligaments for excision of the ankle.) 5. In spite of the very irregular shape of the under surface of the astragalus (fig. 384), a very useful stump for walking is produced by this operation (fig. 385). Fig. 384. Fig. 385.

The foot is placed in an elevated position and flexed to a right angle; an insision, penetrating throughout down to the bone, is carried from the tip of one (left) malleolus transversely across the sole of the foot to the tip of the other (right) malleolus (fig. 386 â€” 388).

200 2. A transverse incision, across the flexor surface, opens wide the hyperextended joint. 3. An incision above the head of the radius divides the external lateral ligament, and an incision below the internal condyle divides the internal lateral ligament. 4. The joint is now widely open; the olecranon is pressed into the wound; an incision above the tip of the olecranon divides the tendon of the triceps (fig. 352 and 353). Fig- 352. Fig. 353. Disarticulation at the elbow by the circular incision. Stump after disarticulation at the elbow by the circular incision. For a representation of a transverse section through the elbow on a level with the condyles see plate XXVI, fig. 1. p. By flaps. 1. A curved incision, beginning 2c,n beloAV one condyle and ending 2cra below the other condyle, is described on the flexor aspect of the forearm; a large semilunar skin flap is thus liberated from the fascia and turned back.

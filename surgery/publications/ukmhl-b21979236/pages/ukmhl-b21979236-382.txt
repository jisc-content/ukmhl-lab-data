502 5. If the latter lias been successfully passed into the bladder, a director curved "like ^ is now carried by its side into the bladder, and upon it an clastic catheter, after the sound has been removed. This is left some (two) days in the bladder, till the danger of extravasation is over. G. But if the staff could not be previously introduced, from the urethra being completely torn across, then it is necessary to find the vesical end; this is generally a very difficult operation. 7. While the edges of the wound are held asunder with fine retractors, the operator tries, without employing any force, to pene- trate with a probe in a direction towards the neck of the bladder. He succeeds most easily, by allowing the patient to pass water and then pushing the probe against the stream of urine. 8. If this is successful, the operator tries to seize the edges of the torn urethra with fine hooks: he then passes a ligature through the edges on both sides with a small curved needle; the edges can thus be drawn apart. 9. Now a rvjcurved director, and Fig. 530. upon it an elastic catheter, can be easily pushed into the bladder. To tie the ca- theter in, a clove-hitch (fig. 530) is made of thick cotton thread, through the loops of which the projecting end is placed. If the ends of the thread are tightly drawn, the knot can never of itself become loose. The ends are then tied either to the hair on the pubes, or to a ring of strapping loosely applied behind the glans penis. 10. If a foreign body (e. g. a ball) has penetrated the bladder, it can generally be removed by an incision in the median hue (Allarton's median lithotomy). 11. The urethra is incised from the perinaeum, as above described, and the prostatic portion dilated by slowly boring with the finger, till a narrow pair of lithotomy forceps can be introduced, and the ball extracted.

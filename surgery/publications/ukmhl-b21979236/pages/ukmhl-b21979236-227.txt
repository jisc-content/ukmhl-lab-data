\65 Plate XXII. Ligature of the posterior tibial artery behind the internal malleolus (right). 1. The cutaneous incision, 3â€”4cm in length, is made midway between the internal malleolus and the tendo Achillis. 2. The deep fascia of the leg (fasciav snralis), which is here strengthened by the fibres of the internal annular ligament (ligamen- tum laciniatum), is divided. 3. Immediately beneath this fascia lies the artery with its venae comites; behind it is the posterior tibial nerve. NB. The sheaths for the tendons of the tibialis posticus, flexor longas digi- torum, and the flexor longus halucis must not be opened. 11*

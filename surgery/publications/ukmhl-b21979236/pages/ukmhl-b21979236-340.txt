260 Fig. 471. 6. The tendon of the sub- scapular^ is peeled from the bone with knife and toothed- forceps, without separating the fibrous capsular ligament from the liberated periosteum. Dur- ing this part of the operation the humerus must be slowly rotated outwards, and as it becomes more and more libe- rated, the knife is frequently changed for the elevator. 7. The arm is rotated in- wards again, the tendon of the biceps lifted from its groove, and slipped over the head of the bone to its inner side. The ligaments of the shoulder joint. g. The periosteum On the outer surface of the neck of the humerus together with the insertions of the supraspinatus, infra- spinatus, and teres minor into the great tuberosity are detached in the same manner as in 6. This preservation of the periosteum is rather difficult in primary excisions, because it is usually so thin. 9. The head of the humerus is forced out of the wound and sawn of! as in the preceding operation. If only the head above the tubero- sities is to be excised (which always gives the best result), there can be no question about detaching the periosteum. Beginning from the interior of the joint the muscular attachments are peeled off from the bone as far as is requisite: care is taken that they are not divided transversely, but that their connection with the bone below is preserved. But since the head cannot then be forced out of the wound, it must be removed with a fine key-hole saw, or with the chain saw. 10. The remaining steps of the operation are the same as in the preceding.

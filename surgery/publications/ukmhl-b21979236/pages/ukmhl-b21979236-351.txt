27\ 2. With a strong short knife the tendinous attachments of the gluteus medius and minimus, obturator, pyriformis, and quadratus femoris (fig. 489) are separated from the trochanter, and the muscles drawn aside with retractors, till the posterior and upper surface of the neck of the femur and the margin of the acetabulum are visible. 3. The joint is opened by an incision made with some force along the margin of the cartilaginous rim; the thigh is flexed and adducted, and with a cracking noise the head starts from the acetabulum. 4. With a narrow knife, which penetrates from behind and the outer side into the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres is divided against the head of the femur: the latter is then completely freed from the acetabulum. 5. The soft parts are protected by a broad spatula, which is pushed behind the neck of the femur; the neck is sawn through with a key-hole or chain saw, while the head is fixed by necrosis forceps (fig. 490). (See the further particulars in the following operation).

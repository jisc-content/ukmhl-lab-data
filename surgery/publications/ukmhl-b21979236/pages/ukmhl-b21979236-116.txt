Fig. 207. which the leg lies entirely exposed upon separate strips of bandage, fastened with safety pins, is particularly well fitted for the antiseptic treatment of extensive injuries, in which no bones are broken. 0. As a plaster of Paris dressing for fractures of the thigh, Volker's 'plaster of Paris with strips of wood is above all others well fitted for field practice and for the transport of the wounded, because the strips of wood, which are inlaid, give it considerable strength, whilst it is far lighter than the ordinary plaster of Paris bandages. If the broken thigh ought to be perfectly securely fixed, not only must the whole leg, but also the pelvis be con- fined in the hardening bandage. The sacrum is first placed high on a pelvic support (fig. 206, 207, 208), in order that the bandages may be carried above it round the pelvis. Counter- extension is effected by a padded iron pole, against which the pa- tient's perinaeum is drawn by an assistant producing extension from each foot, whilst a third assistant fixes the pelvis with both his hands. For the support of the heel during the application of the bandage, an adaptable heel sup- port can be employed (fig. 209). ESMARCH'S pelvic support. BARDELEBENS pelvic support.

52 head, and the inner corners, which belong to it, are carried backwards above the ears, and tied together upon the nape of the neck. C. THE HEAD-NET (fig. 98). A net, made of coarse cotton thread, adheres firmly, without exercis- ing too much pressure or causing heat. A narrow linen ribbon, which is drawn through the meshes of its lower border, fixes it in a circular manner round the forehead, temples, and occiput. A second ribbon, which Fig. 98. Fig. 99. Head-net for keeping dressings on a wound. Head-net for fixing on an ice-bag. is tied beneath the chin, draws the net downwards; and a third contracts the net upon the vertex, like the string of a purse. If an ice-bag is to be placed upon the wound, it is fastened by a ribbon, which is drawn through the meshes of the net (fig. 99). N. DRESSINGS FOR THE FACE. Wounds of the face must be carefully adapted with sutures; the edges of wounds, that are much bruised, are previously removed with the knife. Portions of the nose, lips, and so on, that have been entirely separated, are united, after the bleeding has completely ceased, by fine interrupted sutures (not too tightly); and covered with a material, which keeps off injurious influences from without (e. g. oil-silk, gauze smeared with traumaticin, or salicylic wool). Absolute rest to the part must be procured.

held vertically, and the action of the piston interrupted before the blood column has been pressed down to the lower end of the cylinder, uo fear need be entertained of injecting air into the vein. 20. When using the syringe it is more especially.important, that the piston should be worked very slowly and regularly, for fear of over- filling the right heart. Not more than Fig. 296. 25 grammes of blood a minute should ever be injected. In Hasse-s transfusion syringe (fig. 296) the piston is worked by a female screw, whose revolutions permit a very gentle and uniform pressure. 21. The above mentioned danger is most certainly avoided by employing an artery for the injection, as Huter does (arterielle transfusion). In adults the radial artery above the wrist or the posterior tibial ar- tery behind the internal malleolus is chosen for the purpose, in children the brachial artery at the inner border of the biceps. 22. The artery is exposed as above de- scribed, and two catgut ligature passed be- neath it. With one the artery is tied at the central end of the incision, and then opened by a small flap-like wound: the point of the syringe is pushed into the open- ing towards the periphery, and firmly tied in by the second Ligature. 23. Since considerable pressure must be employed in arterial transfusion, to drive the blood through the capillaries, a good syringe must be used for this purpose or Collin's apparatus. 24. As soon as the transfusion is finished, the syringe is with- drawn from the artery, and the peripheral end ligatured. The artery LS thru divided between the two ligatures, and the wound dressed anti- septically. 25. In many cases transfusion can be avoided by temporarily driving the blood out of the extremities, elastic bandages being tightly HASSE'S syringe for transfusion.

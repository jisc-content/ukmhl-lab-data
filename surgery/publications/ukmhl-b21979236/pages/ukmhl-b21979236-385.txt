505 Fig. 534. VOLKMANN'S bed-lift. The canvass, stretched by the wooden frame, lias in its centre an aperture for defecation. By means of the strap fixed to each end, the frame is raised with the patient, and kept in this position by wooden rests. The pulleys for the extension are fastened to this frame. 4. Siebold's apparatus for raising the patient has also much to recommend it on account of its simplicity (fig. 535). The strong pole is easily raised by pulleys, which are fastened to the ceiling. Since the belts, in which the patient swings, cling to the body when raised, a board, like the one represented to the left in fig. 535, must be pushed in above the body at the places where this lias to he avoided. The board keeps the belts apart. 5. The adaptable bed-rest is a great comfort to those, who are seriously ill or wounded; it is placed beneath the pillow and permits the patient to assume different positions. They are easily and with little expense made iii the form here represented (fig. 536). Esmarch, the Surgeon's Handbook. 20

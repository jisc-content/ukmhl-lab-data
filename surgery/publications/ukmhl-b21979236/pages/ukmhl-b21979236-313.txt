23o Fig. 421. Disarticulation at the hip i.by the circular method,). 4. After the elastic ligature has been removed and all the bleeding arrested, a knife is pushed 5c,n above the top of the great trochanter on to the head of the femur, and carried down over the middle of the great trochanter to the circular incision, dividing throughout the soft parts down to the bone (Dieffenbacii). 5. The operator seizes the stump of the femur with a strong pair of forceps, and while the edges of the vertical incision are separated by an assistant, he strips the periosteum from the bone with the raspa- tory, till he comes to the attachments of the muscles; these must be separated from the bone with a strong knife. 6. When the bone has been in this manner exposed up to the capsule, the joint is opened as described above, and the head dislo- cated (tig. 422). The haemorrhage at this part of the operation is generally insignificant.

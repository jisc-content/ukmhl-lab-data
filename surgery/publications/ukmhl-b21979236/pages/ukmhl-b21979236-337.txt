257 Fig. 463. The tendon of the long head of the biceps. the whole length of the sheath to- gether with the capsular ligament up to the acromion. 5. The tendon of the biceps is lifted out of its groove, and drawn outwards with the blunt retractor. 6. While the assistant rotates the arm outwards, a curved incision, with a strong knife placed at right angles upon the bone, is carried round from the opening in the joint over the lesser tuberosity, dividing the capsu- lar ligament and subscapularis muscle (fig. 464). Fig. 464. Fig. 465. 7. The arm being again rotated inwards, the tendon of the biceps is also drawn inwards over the head of the bone/ 8. The knife is again carried round in a larger circle over the greater tuberosity, and divides the capsule together with the insertions of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor (fig. 465 and 466). 9. The head of the humerus is forced out of the wound by pressure from below, seized with forceps (Fauabceuf's clutch-forceps are the best) (fig. 433 and 437), and after the posterior insertion of the capsule has been divided, removed with the key-hole saw (fig. 468). 10. When the head of the humerus is separated from the dia- physis by the bullet, it must be drawn forwards and fixed by a sharp bone-hook (fig. 443), or by a bullet-screw (fig. 508). If it is shattered into many pieces, the fragments can be separately seized and removed Eamarch, the Surgeon's Handbook. 17

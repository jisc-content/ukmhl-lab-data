11 MA Plate XX. Ligature of the posterior tibial artery above the middle of the leg (right). 1. The cutaneous incision is 8â€”10cm in length, and at a distance of lera from the inner edge of the tibia. 2. After the division of the fascia, the border of the gastrocnemius is drawn backwards, and the soleus separated from the tibia: the opening is enlarged with the tip of the ringer, till the strong deep aponeurosis appears, which consists of the tendinous fibres of the soleus, and the deep fascia of the leg. 3. After the division of this fascia, the artery is seen lying between its two veins; the posterior tibial nerve is somewhat behind the artery. Etmarch, the Surgeon's Handbook.

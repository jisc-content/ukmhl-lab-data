285 or still better with Roser's forceps (fig. 504), which are introduced closed and then slowly opened.

If the wound is so deep, that the finger is unable to reach the end, the common thin probes are not used, for nothing can be accurately felt with them, and their fine points very easily make false passages: but flexible -pewter probes a foot long and of the thickness of a quill (fig. 505) are employed, with which no in- jury is done, if the examination is carefully conducted. NB. It is dangerous to employ ca- theters, that have heen used, for such an examination, as I have sometimes seen done, because some infectious matter may easily have heen left behind in its interior from a former use of the instrument.

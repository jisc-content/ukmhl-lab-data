(A In the same way, for injuries on the volar aspect of the hand, a hood-like process can be raised, at the lower end of the paste-board trough, which fixes the hand in the flexed position (fig. 123). Fig. 123. Paste-board trough for injuries on the volar aspect of the wrist. Arm-troughs can also be made out of tin, wire, wire gauze etc., but they are more expensive, and not so useful as those made of paste-board. 3) To raise the hand, a sloping board is used, which can be placed at any angle, and rests upon a table standing by the bed, or upon the bed boards: and this sloping board is at the same time so arranged, that in irrigating, it conducts the water, which runs away, into the bucket (s. fig. 16, pag. 9). 4) To suspend the hand vertically, the whole arm is bandaged by spiral turns (not with circular turns) firmly upon a splint, which is used for excision of the wrist (fig. 126), or upon a Volkmann's splint (fig. 124); and this is raised and suspended by a cord, fastened to the lower end (fig. 125).

255 Fig. 459. Fi8- 460- Ligaments of the right elbow joint. of the triceps; the latter must be separated from the tip of the olecranon with the knife. 7. Both flaps are pushed outwards over the external condyle, and the joint opened; a few incisions between the head of the radius and the humerus divide the external lateral and orbicular ligaments (fig. 460). 8. The joint gapes widely open; the articular end of the humerus is seized with a pair of bone forceps, and sawn off at the margin of the articular cartilage. 9. By an incision upon the coronoid process of the ulna the upper fibres of the insertion of the brachialis anticus are divided; the ole- cranOD is then seized with the forceps, and the articular surface of the ulna, as far as it is covered with cartilage, removed with the saw. 10. The head of the, radius is also sawn off.

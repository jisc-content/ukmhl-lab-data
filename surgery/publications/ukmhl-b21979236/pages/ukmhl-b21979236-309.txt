Fig. 416. Position of the patient for changing the dressing on a stump after amputation of the thigh. r. Disarticulation at the hip. . a. With a large anterior and a small posterior flap (Manec) by transfixion. 1. The patient is so placed, that half the pelvis on the injured side projects beyond the lower edge of the table. The upper part of the body must be carefully fixed, and the scrotum drawn upwards towards the opposite side (fig. 417). 2. After the limb has been made bloodless in the manner described on pages 134 —136, a large anterior flap is cut from within outwards in the following manner. The operator enters the point of a long am- putating knife (fig. 298) midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the top of the trochanter. The point is carefully glided over the head of the femur (by which the capsule is' opened) in a direction parallel with Poupart's ligament: it is then turned down- wards and inwards, and made to pass out again on the inner side of the thigh close to the perinaeum (fig. 418). By carrying the knife down- wards in long sawing strokes, he cuts a well rounded flap, 18 — 20cm in length, which is immediately turned upwards and kept in that position.

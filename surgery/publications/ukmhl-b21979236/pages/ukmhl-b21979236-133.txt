U3 Fig. 241. ESMARCH'S chloroform apparatus a quantity of air is drawn through the flannel. Care must be taken not to pour on too much chloroform at once, as it drops off on to the face, or into the eye, where it may excite severe inflammation. 7. Chloroform commonly produces at first an excitement like that of drunkenness â€” the stage of excitement: this is followed after a longer or shorter time by the tolerant stage, in which by degrees the movements cease, and together with consciousness sensibility disappears; in the cornea and nasal mucous membrane last of all. When touching these parts excites no reflex movement, we recognise that the narcosis is profound and complete. 8. Chloroform has also a paralysing effect upon the vaso-motor centres of the medulla oblongata, and the motor ganglia of the heart itself. The respiration and the hearts action are both impaired. The respirations are more frequent and superficial, the pulse smaller and weaker. In consequence the blood becomes dark and venous, containing more carbonic acid. The blood pressure diminishes, the temperature of the body falls, and the tissue change is interfered with. 9. If circumstances now arise, which further impede the respiration and the heart's action, the condition becomes one dangerous to life, and demands prompt and efficient assistance. 10. Sudden arrest of the respiratory and cardiac movements may take place during the first stage, in consequence of the inhalation of Etmarch, the Surgeon's Handbook. q

39 thrown away, but as far as possible turned to account for bandages, e. g. parts of cloaks, coats, trowsers, boot-tops, hats, knapsacks etc. . The men of the army hospital corps must, even in time of peace, be exercised in preparing impromptu splints and employing weapons as their first dressings. L. THE HARDENING BANDAGES. 1. THE STARCH BANDAGE was invented by Seutin in 1840. 1. Preparation of starch paste. Starch is stirred with cold water to a uniform cream like consistence, and then, whilst constantly stirring, as much boiling water is added, as will produce a clear thickish mucilage. 2. Starch bandages are strips of shirting, which are drawn through the fresh paste and rolled up into bandages. 3. Starch splints are made of strips of paste-board, which are drawn once quickly through hot water, and then thickly smeared on both sides with the paste. 4. Application of the starch bandage. The limb is very carefully bandaged with a moist flannel roller, after the recesses about the joints have been padded with cotton wool. A starch bandage is then applied, on which the soft starch splints are laid; and these are firmly ban- daged on with a starch roller. Finally the whole is enveloped with a dry calico, cotton, or gauze bandage. 5. Strips of paper can be used instead of the bandages: they are drawn through the paste, and applied after the method of Scultet's bandage (many-tailed). 6. Burggraeve's method of cotton wool and paste-board is very simple and practical. Paste-board splints are cut to the shape of the limb, then covered on one side with paste, and on the other with a layer of cotton wool; the splints are applied with the cotton wool next the limb, and firmly ban- daged on with a dry gauze roller; in doing which, one begins with the quickly ascending spiral, in order only first to fix the splints to the limb. Over the gauze bandage is rubbed with the hands, or a large brush an

203 as the acromion and turned back, so that the capsule of the shoulder joint is exposed. 4. The head of the humerus is pushed upwards; and an incision, made with some force above the two tuberosities, divides the capsule and tendons in front of the joint. 5. The head of the humerus is now tilted forwards, while the knife, placed behind it, divides the capsule on the inner side of the joint. 6. The operator draws the head of the humerus forwards with his left hand, carries the knife with long sweeping strokes down the inner side of the bone, as far as 6cm below the axillary folds. He then turns the edge of the knife inwards (towards the thorax), and divides all the soft parts with one stroke. In this inner flap run the great vessels and nerves. } 7. When the haemorrhage cannot be completely controlled by compression of the subclavian artery, before the inner flap is com- pleted, an assistant, standing above with his thumb in the wound and his fingers in the axilla, seizes the soft parts on the inside and thoroughly compresses the artery (fig. 356).

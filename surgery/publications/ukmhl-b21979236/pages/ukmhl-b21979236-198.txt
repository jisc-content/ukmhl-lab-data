154 Plate XIII. Ligature of the common iliac artery (left). 1. The cutaneous incision, 10â€”12cm in length, begins 3cm below and to the inner side of the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and ascends vertically, with a slight concavity inwards, almost to the last rib. 2. When the division of the adipose tissue, of the thin superlicial fascia, of the muscular layers of the external oblique, internal oblique and trans verbal is, and of the thin transversalis fascia is completed, the peritoneum is exposed. 3. The peritoneum is carefully pressed inwards towards the um- bilicus, and drawn with the lingers towards the inner margin of the wound. 4. The ureter generally clings to the peritoneum; if not, it is seen running obliquely over the point of division of the common iliac artery, and care must be taken to avoid injuring it. 5. The whole of the common iliac artery now lies exposed, from the aorta to its division; on the left the iliac vein lies internally, on the right it lies behind the artery. NB. The internal iliac artery can also be tied by the same incision.

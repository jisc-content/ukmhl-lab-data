180 Fig. 310. Anterior skin flap and the posterior circular incision. The skin flaps are turned upwards, and at the point of reflexion all the muscles are divided down to the bone by one circular sweep of the knife (fig. 309): the bone is then sawn through. 4. Amputation by muscular flaps. The amputation by flaps of skin and muscle is not to be re- commended so much as the former, because the surfaces of the wound are larger, and more especially because the arteries are divided obliquely. The flaps can be cut either from without inwards (Langenbeck) (fig. 311), for which purpose a very sharp knife is required, or from within outwards (Verduin) by transfixion of the soft parts close to the bone at the bases of the flaps with a double edged knife, which is carried obliquely downwards to the surface in long sawing movements (see disarticulation at the hip joint).

\28 so that no more blood can pass through the arteries. The ends of the tube are fastened together by a knot, or by a hook and chain (Plate I fig. 2 and fig. 260.) Fig. 260. ESMARCH'S apparatus, for the bloodless operation. 3. The arteries can also be completely compressed in most cases by an elastic bandage, firmly applied in many circular turns, and at the end fastened with a safety pin (v. Langenbeck-s Schniirbinde). (Plate II, fig. 1.) 4. Then the first elastic bandage is taken off. If the circulation has been effectually cut off, the limb exhibits a completely blanched appearance like that of a dead subject, and any operation can be per- formed without loss of blood just as on the dead subject. (Plate I, fig. 3. Plate II, fig. 1.) 5. Parts which contain unhealthy pus must not be firmly bandaged, for infecting matter may thereby be driven upwards into the cellular tissue, and into the lymphatics. In such cases one must be satisfied with raising the limb on high for a few minutes before applying the bandage, so as to diminish the amount of blood in the vessels (Lister). 6. Instead of the chain and hook a clasp can be used for fixing the ends, i. e., a cleft ring of the diameter of the tube or ligature employed, through the cleft of which the stretched ends can be easily pressed.

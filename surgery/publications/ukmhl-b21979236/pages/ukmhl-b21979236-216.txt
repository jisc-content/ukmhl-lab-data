160 Plate- XIX. Ligature of the anterior tibial artery above the middle of the leg (left). 1. The cutaneous incision is 0â€”8C,U in length, and 3cm to the outer side of the crest of the tibia (in the space between the tibia and fibula). 2. The fascia is divided in the course of the white line nearest the tibia, which will lead to the intermuscular septum between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus halucis: the interval between these muscles is widened with the tip of the index finger till the sheath is visible. 3. Alter careful division of the sheath, the artery is seen between two veins; on its outer side lies the anterior tibial nerve (nervus pero- naeus profundus). s

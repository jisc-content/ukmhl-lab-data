If the case be one of gun-shot fracture or injury to a joint, in this examination a definite decision can be made, whether the injured limit is to be any longer treated on conservative principles, whether it lias to be fixed in a suitable position by splints or har- dening bandages, or whether a capital operation (amputation, ex- cision etc.) must be immediately undertaken. 18. If projectiles, which have been imbedded in the bone for years, or pieces of necrosed bone, which lie in so called sequestral cavities, are to be removed, then an opening must be made (Nekro- tomie) into the bony cavity. This necrosis occurs rather frequently after osteomyelitis from gun-shot contusion of bone. 19. These operations can be most quickly and conveniently per- formed with chisel and hammer; here also the common carpenter's chisel with a handle, like those commonly found in the surgical in- strument cases (fig. 499), is very useful. At all events, in default of the latter, the necessary instrument can be obtained at the first best joiner's or turner's shop that is met with. 20. The bone in question being exposed by a free incision at a convenient spot, the thickened periosteum is pushed back on both sides with the raspatory, and the sequestral cavity opened by a few sharp blows of the chisel: it is sufficiently enlarged to freely expose the dead bone and to remove it with necrosis forceps (fig. 514). Fig. 514. Necrosis forceps. 21. If there is only one projectile, lying in a sequestral cavity, to be removed, the cloaca, which leads through the bony wall to the foreign body, can be most quickly enlarged with a Marshall's osteotribe (fig. 515).

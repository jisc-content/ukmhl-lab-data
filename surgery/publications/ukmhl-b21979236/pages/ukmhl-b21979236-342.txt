262 X. EXCISION OF THE ANKLE. Lanuenbecks subperiosteal operation. 1. The foot is placed upon its inner side and a vertical incision, 6cni in length, is carried down along the posterior border of the lower end of the fibula. This in- cision turns round at the tip of the external malleolus forming a sort of hoojc, and follows its anterior border for l-5cm: it penetrates throughout the whole length of the incision right down to the bone (fig. 473). 2. The periosteum, together with the skin, muscles, and the sheaths of the tendons upon the anterior and posterior surfaces are libe- rated from the bone, till at the upper end of the incision a key-hole or chain saw can be carried behind the fibula (fig. 474). NB. The sheath of the tendon of the peronaeus longus must not be injured. Fig. 474. •• l. AchiU. peron. long. abd. dig. V. peron. brtv. peron. Cert. Outer side of the let* ankle (HENKE).

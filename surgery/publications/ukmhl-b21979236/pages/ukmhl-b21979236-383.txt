bandage, as is shewn in fig. 533. 505 12. If the bullet has already remained a long time in the bladder, so that urinary concretions have formed around it, it becomes necessary to choose some other method of lithotomy, by which larger bodies can be removed from the bladder without too much tearing (lateral litho- tomy, snpra-puhic lithotomy). P. OPERATIONS WITH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT. I. In war the surgeon has frequently to operate at night; and on board ship during an engagement the necessary operations must ac- cording to the rules be performed with artificial light below deck. Fig. 531. Wax-torch. 2. For most operations a strong light upon the seat of operation is absolutely necessary; and the sur- geon must know what to do, if, as commonly happens, the place itself is only insufficiently lighted. 3. The wax-torch is a simple and very good means of obtaining light (fig. 531): it is made out of the common wax-taper, about the thick- ness of a quill, three or four of which are twisted together like a rope. To protect the hand against the hot wax as it trickles down, the torch is placed through a disk of paste board, which has a hole cut in its centre. 4. Ravoth-s operating-candle (fig. 532) gives a superior light: it is a wax candle, which is placed in a socket provided with a spiral spring; it carries a moveable metallic mirror, i which reflects the light upon the seat of operation. 5. In default of this apparatus, a reflector can be improvised by fastening a silver spoon to the wax candle by means of a pad and

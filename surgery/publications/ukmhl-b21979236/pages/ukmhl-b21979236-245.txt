V9 Fig. 307. LANGENBECK'S knife for flap amputation. Fig. 308. Two large skin flaps of equal size. It is generally most convenient to form a large anterior and a smaller posterior flap (fig. 309), so that the larger flap hangs down over the divided muscles like a curtain. Fig. 309. Large anterior and small posterior skin flaps. â€¢. The skin can also he divided transversely on the posterior aspect by a half-circular incision and reflected slightly upwards (fig. 310). In such a case the base of the large anterior flap must be somewhat smaller than half the circumference of the limb, but its length equal to the diameter of the Limb. 12*

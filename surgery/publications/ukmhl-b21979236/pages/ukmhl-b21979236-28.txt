8 I). THE REDUCTION OF HEAT. For subduing the inflammation, cold by the abstraction of heat, is of service, and this is employed in various ways: 1. In the form of Cold Wrappings; they must be very frequently changed, if such heat is really constantly to be abstracted, but this easily disturbs the injured part. If one allows them to remain longer so that they become hot, they act as excitants (Priessnitz's wrappings). 2. As Dry Cold, by ice in india- rubber bags (ice-bag). The ice-bags must lie securely closed by wooden plugs or large corks, round which the closed mouth of the bag is firmly tied by a narrow bandage (fig. 14). If the direct application of the ice- bag is too cold, some layers of linen are laid between the ice-bag and the part. Pig's bladders are apt to leak, and soon putrefy. To avoid the former they must be rubbed before use both inside and outside with lard. Glass-bottles and tin-boxes filled with ice or cold water abstract the heat more energetically than india- rubber bags, but they are not so well applied to the body. A very energetic cooling in inflam- mations of the extremities can be pro- duced by the Cooling-coil (s. fig. 15). This is the name given to a long india-rubber tube, which is wound in serpentine turns round the inflamed part; one end of this tube pro- vided with a perforated tin block is sunk into a pail filled with ice- water, whilst the other end hangs down into an empty pail.

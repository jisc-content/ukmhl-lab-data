250 11. During the after-treatment the excised joint must be fixed by one of the methods described on pages 63 â€” 65. The treatment by extension is adopted, as soon as possible, by fastening to all the fingers strips of plaster in the form of a gauntlet, through the loops of which a thin wooden stick is placed. To this stick a weight is attached by means of a line cord, which runs over a pulley. The counter-extension can be effected by a larger form of strapping, which is fastened to both surfaces of the forearm, and drawn backwards by a stretched india-rubber ring. The arm rests upon an inclined plane (fig. 455). Fig.*455. Extension of the wrist. IV. EXCISION OF THE ELBOW. With Liston's T incision. 1. The elbow is flexed to an obtuse angle, and its posterior sur- face presented to the operator by an assistant, who seizes the forearm with one hand and the ujjper arm with the other (fig. 457). 2. A vertical incision 8cm in length, the centre of which runs along the inner border of the olecranon, opens the capsule between the olecranon and the internal condyle (fig. 456). 3. While the left thumb-nail draws the soft parts forcibly inwards from the internal condyle, a small knife completes the separation by short incisions at right angles to the bone; till the epicondyle is ex- posed and projects out of the wound (fig. 457). During this part of the

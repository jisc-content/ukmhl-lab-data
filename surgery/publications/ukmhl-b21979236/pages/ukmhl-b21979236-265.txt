w f. Disarticulation at the wrist. a. Circular incision. 1. A circular incision is carried round the hand over the middle of the metacarpal bones, 4cm below the styloid processes. 2. The skin is liberated all round by perpendicular incisions, till it can be reflected over the styloid processes like a cuff. 3.1 The hand is pronated and forcibly flexed: the tendons are divided, and the wrist joint opened by an incision over the dorsum from one styloid process to the other with a slight convexity upwards. 4. The lateral ligaments are divided beneath the styloid processes, and finally the anterior part of the capsule and all the flexor tendons are cut through with one stroke of the knife (fig. 346 and 347). Fig. 346. Fig. 347. Disarticulation of the hand by the circular incision. (3. By the flap amputation. I. The operator takes hold of the lower part of the pronated hand, flexes it, and carries a semilunar incision over the middle of the back of the hand, from the tip of one styloid process to the other (fig. 348).

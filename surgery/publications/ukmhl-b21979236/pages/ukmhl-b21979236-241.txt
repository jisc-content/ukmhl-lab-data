\75 bone without stretching, it must be sawn through again as high up as the diameter of the limb requires. For this purpose the end of the bone is seized with a pair of clutch forceps, and while the soft parts are drawn forcibly upwards, the periosteum is peeled up by a raspa- tory till the bone is uncovered for the required distance.* Fig. 300. Pushing back the periosteum. Fig. 301. Stump after the single circular incision. For limbs with one bone this method yields the smallest and most level wound of all. It is not suitable for limbs with a large muscular developement, but is particularly good for pa- tients wasted and exhausted with prolonged suppuration. The wound can be united in any direction by sutures. Fig. 301 shows the appearance of a recent stump, after it has been united transversely. * Bkunninohausen has already re- commended this treatment in his "Erfah rungen und Bemerkungen iiher die Amputation", Bamberg 1818, page 65 and page 70.

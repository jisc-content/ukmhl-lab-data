* By an oversight it is market on Plate VIII as cutaneus interims. w Plate VIII. Ligature of the axillary artery in the right axilla. 1. The cutaneous incision, 5"" in length, Avitli the arm raised, along the inner border of the coraco-brachialis, begins where this muscle is crossed by the pectoralis major. 2. After the division of the fascia a bundle of nerves appears, which surrounds the artery. The axillary vein lies at the posterior border of this plexus and somewhat more superficial. 3. The bundle of nerves is separated, the anterior cord (n. me- dianus et cutancus medius*) being drawn forwards, the posterior cord (n. ulnaris et radialis) drawn backwards, and the sheath of the artery opened.

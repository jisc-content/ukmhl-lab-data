The tendons of the extensor and flexor longus halucis are divided over the joint, which is opened on the dorsal aspect, and while the bone is steadily twisted round its axis in opposite directions, its connections with the internal cuneiform bone are liberated all round. e. Disarticulation of the fifth toe with its metatarsal bone. 1. The flap-operation can be performed here in a manner similar to that, which has been described before in the disarticulation of the thumb (pag. 194). 2. The left hand forcibly separates the fifth toe from the fourth, whilst the right carries a narrow knife upwards between the two meta- tarsal bones from the skin of the web, till it encounters resistance. 3. The end of the cutaneous incision is prolonged upwards about lcm both on the dorsal and plantar surfaces. 4. By forcible abduction of the fifth metatarsal bone its base is separated first from that of the fourth metatarsal bone, and then from the cuboid. 5. The knife is carried round the projecting tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone, and from here downwards along the outer side of the bone. A tongue-shaped outer flap is thus formed, whose rounded point is made to terminate exactly opposite the first incision, which was made in the web between the fourth and fifth toes (fig. 366).

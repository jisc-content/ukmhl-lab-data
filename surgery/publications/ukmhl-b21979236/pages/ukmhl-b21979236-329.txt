249 *7. The radio-carpal joint lies open before you. The hand is Hexed so that the articular surfaces of the upper row of carpal bones are exposed. 8. The scaphoid rig. 454. (nav.) is liberated from the trapezium (m. ma.) and trapezoid (m. mi.), the semilunar (lun.) and cuneiform (triq.) from the os magnum (cap.) and unciform (ham.) by dividing the intercarpal ligaments, and gently lifted out with a narrow elevator. The trapezium (m.ma.) and pisiform bones can be. left behind (fig- 454). 9. The bones of the anterior carpal row are then taken out. The globular articular head of the os mag- num (cap.) is seized with the fingers of the left hand or a pair of vulsellum forceps: and while an assistant abducts the thumb the ligaments uniting the trapezium (m. ma.) with the tra- pezoid (m. mi.) are divided: the operator then tries to penetrate from here in a direction towards the ulna into the carpo-metacarpal joints by dividing the ligaments on the extensor side of the bases of the metacarpal bones, while an assistant forcibly flexes the latter. The three carpal bones of the anterior row [trapezoid (m. mi.), os magnum (cap.), and unciform (ham.)] can thus be lifted out together. 10. Finally, while the hand is flexed, the epiphyses of the radius and ulna can be forced out of the wound, carefully stripped (as described above), and sawn off. In doing this, care must be taken not to wound the radial artery as it runs over the trapezium (m. ma.) to the first interosseous space (fig. 449). The carpal bones.

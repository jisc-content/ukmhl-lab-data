26\ Fig. 472. IX. EXCISION OF THE GLENOID CAVITY. 1. Bone is only removed from the scapula in excision of the shoulder, if this bone also has been injured by the bullet. But if the articular surface of the scapula is alone shattered and the head of the humerus is uninjured, then only the former need be sawn off. 2. If there be no gun-shot wound, as there generally is, to indicate the direction, the joint is most conveniently opened by the following method. 0 . , . . . , . , 6. A cmwed incision, which passes round the posterior border of the acromion and divides the fibres of the deltoid, exposes the posterior and upper surface' of the joint (fig. 472). 4. From the centre of this incision the knife is carried down to the po- sterior and upper margin of the glenoid cavity, dividing the capsular ligament upon the middle of the great tuberosity, in a vertical direction between the ten- dons of the supraspinatus and infra- spinatus, and at the same time di- viding the skin and the deltoid muscle in the direction of its fibres. 5. While the soft parts are forcibly separated with retractors, the tendon of the long head of the biceps is libe- rated from the margin of the glenoid cavity, and the capsular ligament to- gether with the periosteum from the nedk of the scapula; the latter is suf- ficiently exposed to remove the ar- ticular surface with the key-hole saw, Excision of the glenoid cavity of the scapula. orto liberate the fragments of shattered bone with the knife. 6. The after-treatment is the same as in excision of the shoulder.

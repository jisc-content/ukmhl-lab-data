255 condyle is completely exposed. The last incisions are carried round this prominence, and separate the origins of the flexor muscles as well as the internal lateral ligament from the humerus, without however disturbing their connection with the periosteum. 4. After the liberated tissues have been brought back to their former position, the outer part of the tendon of the triceps is drawn outwards, and separated from the olecranon by short incisions, but left connected with the periosteum on the outer side of the ulna, which together with the anconeus is raised from the bone. 5. The fibrous capsule is liberated from the margin of the articular surface of the humerus by incisions following closely upon one another and directed against the bone (first at the trochlea and then at the eminentia capitata), till the external condyle appears. 6. The external lateral ligament and the origin of the extensor muscles are then separated from the external condyle in such a manner, that all these parts remain in connection with one another, and with the periosteum of the humerus. 7. When the external condyle has thus been freely exposed, the joint is forcibly flexed, and the articular surfaces forced out of the wound: these are sawn off one after the other, as described in the preceding chapter. 8. If it is necessary to remove the ulna below the coronoid process, the upper fibres of the insertion of the brachialis anticus must be divided, without destroying the connection of the tendon with the periosteum of the ulna. VI. EXCISION OF THE ELBOW. Hoteus lateral incisions. 1. A longitudinal incision, 2cm in length, exposes the internal con- dyle: a curved incision below this prominence divides the internal lateral ligament. 2. A longitudinal incision on the outer side of the joint, 8 â€”10cm in length, passes over the external condyle and the head of the radius. 3. The soft parts are retracted, and the external lateral and or- bicular ligaments divided.

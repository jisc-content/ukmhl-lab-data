\b2 Plate XL 1. Ligature of the radial artery in the upper third of the right forearm. 1. The cutaneous incision commences 3cm below the fold of the elbow, and runs for 4cra along a line, which divides in the supine position the radial from the central third of the anterior surface of the forearm. 2. After the division of the fascia of the forearm, the interval be- tween the bellies of the supinator longus and the flexor carpi radialis is sought for, and enlarged with the tip of the index linger. 3. At the bottom of the wound lies the artery with its venae comites; on its radial side is the radial nerve. 2. Ligature of the ulna artery in the upper third of right forearm. 1. The cutaneous incision commences 3cm below the fold of the elbow, and runs for 4cm along a line, which divides in the supine position the ulnar from the central third of the anterior surface of the forearm. 2. After the division of the fascia of the forearm, the interval between the bellies of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor sublimis digitorum is sought for, and enlarged with the tip of the index finger and blunt hook. 3. At the bottom lies the artery with its venae comites; on its ulnar side is the ulnar nerve. *

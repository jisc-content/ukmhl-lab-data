The cutaneous incision is 5—6cm in length, vertical, and a finger's breadth to the outer side of the crest of the tibia. 2. The fascia being divided, the finger is pushed into the interval between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus halucis, and the muscles separated till the interosseous membrane is reached (2—3cm in depth). 3.

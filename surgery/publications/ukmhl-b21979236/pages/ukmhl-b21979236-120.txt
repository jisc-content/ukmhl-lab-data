\00 handkerchief, whilst a second handker- chief is carried over the perinaeum to effect the counter - extension: and a third handkerchief, like a belt, fastens the upper end of the splint to the trunk. A fourth, and fifth handkerchief fix the side of the thigh and leg to the splint. t. But the treatment by extension first came into general use, after Crosby had taught how an extension, lasting a long time, could be made supportable by an appropiate distribution of the point of fastening over a large surface of the skin. Crosby's strapping consists of a strong broad strip of plaster, which is applied lengthways on both sides of the leg as far upwards as the seat of fracture in the thigh. A small piece of board is then pressed against the hinder part of the sole of the foot, whilst the plaster is firmly fixed in many places by a second strip of plaster, which is carried round the leg in spiral turns (fig. 216).

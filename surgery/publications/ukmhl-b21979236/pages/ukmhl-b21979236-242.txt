\76 2. The doable circular incision (Petit). In the first place the skin is divided down to the fascia by circular incision round the limb (fig. 302). Fig. 302. Double circular incision. The integument is then detached, an assistant drawing it forcibly upwards, by repeated incisions upon the fascia carried round per- pendicularly to the axis of the limb (fig. 303) (not as in fig. 304), till it can be turned up like a cuff. The length of the cuff must be equal to half the diameter of the limb. If, on account of the limb increasing rapidly in circumference above the first incision, the cut border is too narrow to turn over, the skin can be divided at one or two places opposite each other by short longitudinal inci- sions (see disarticulation at the knee). The muscles are now divi- ded all round close to the line of reflexion by one steady circular

256 0. A subperiosteal excision of the end of the bone is much more satisfactory. The cicatrix or ulcerated surface on the projecting bone is freed from the tissues by an incision carried round with a strong knife: the soft tissues are then divided below or laterally (avoiding the part where the large vessels and nerves lie) down to the bone, and the periosteum peeled back from the bone with the raspatory far enough to allow a sufficiently large piece of the bone to be removed with the saw. The haemorrhage is generally very trifling. A drainage tube is introduced as far as the sawn surface of bone and the wound closed with the interrupted suture. It commonly heals by tirst intention, and the result is a good stump completely covered with soft tissues. 4. If the first amputation has been made in the neighbourhood of a joint, then the subperiosteal disarticulation can be employed in the same manner (cf. fig. 422). F. EXCISION OF JOINTS. I. GENERAL RULES FOR EXCISION. 1. The principle of excision is to remove injured or diseased joints with as small a wound of the soft parts as possible. 2. The division of the skin and muscles must therefore be made by preference in the long axis of the limb, and any injury of the larger vessels, nerves, and tendons carefully avoided. 3. The [(reservation of the periosteum with all the tendons and muscles attached to it in the neighbourhood of the joint (subperiosteal excision, von Laingicnbeck, Ollieh) is of great importance both during the period of healing, and for the subsequent functions of the limb, and must therefore always be attempted. The operation is difficult in recent cases, but easy in older ones. For this reason in the excision of individual joints the older method is here described. 4. To preserve the periosteum, it must be divided in the same direction as the skin, and be peeled off from the bone with the soft parts by means of blunt instruments such as the raspatory (fig. 425) and the elevator (fig. 426).

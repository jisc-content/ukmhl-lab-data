52 3. METAL SPLINTS. a. Splints of tin-plated iron are especially employed, like the wooden splints, for the temporary disposition of broken limbs on the battle field, and for the first transport. They are quickly and cheaply produced! and can be easily soldered together at angles corresponding to the joints. Volkmann's tin splint for the lower extremity -is especially suitable for this purpose. Fig. 53. VOLKMANN'S tin splint. b. Splints , can be cut out of zinc with a strong pair of scissors: they can be bent with the hands, and nicely adjusted to the shape of the limb. In "Ersatztornister fur den Verbandplatz" the author has described a large chest of zinc, which can be used on the battle field as a receptacle for water, and at the end cut to pieces for splints. c. Of iron loire, well padded wire baskets (Mayor, Bonnet) are made, in which the broken limbs lie comfortably. Flaps or trap-doors can easily be made, so that the wounds can be dressed without taking the limb out of the splint. But they are very expensive, and demand too much room for military practice (fig. 54â€”56).

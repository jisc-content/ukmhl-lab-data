A broad spatula is placed between the bone and the periosteum on the flexor side, to protect the soft parts; and whilst the periosteum and the soft parts are drawn upwards on the extensor side by a similar spatula, or a retractor, the lower end of the radius is sawn off with a key-hole saw, or a fine excision saw (fig. 450).

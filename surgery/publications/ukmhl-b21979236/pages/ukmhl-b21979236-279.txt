205 4. The stump of the humerus is sei- zed with a strong pair of forceps, or with the left hand; and whilst an assi- stant separates the edges of the vertical incision, the operator liberates the head of the humerus from the joint (fig. 358) by short incisions, directed well against the bone, which is at the same time forcibly rotated; or in suitable cases the operation is per- formed subperioste- ally with elevator and raspatory. 5. Fig. 359 shews the appearance of the stump. IV, AMPUTATIONS AND DISARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. a. Disarticulation of the toes is performed in the same manner as the disarticulation of the fingers (page 189). b. Disarticulation of all the toes together at the metatarso- phalangeal joints. 1. While all the toes are bent forcibly upwards by the left hand, a curved incision, beginning on the inner side of the first metatarso- phalangeal joint (left foot) and terminating on the outer side of the corresponding joint of the fifth toe, is carried along the groove between the sole of the foot and the base of the toes. (For the right foot it is reversed.) (Fig. 360).

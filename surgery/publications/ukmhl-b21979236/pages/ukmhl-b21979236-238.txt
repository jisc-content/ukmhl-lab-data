(AHPUTATIOXS AMI lllSAKTKTLATin\S i I. GENERAL RULES FOR AMPUTATIONS, a. Preliminary steps. 1. Each assistant has his especial duty and position pointed out to him. The patient is so placed, that the chloroform can be easily administered, and the operator and assistants have sufficient room. 2. The limb to be amputated must be turned to the light. 3. The operator stands in the most advantageous position, when the amputated limb falls towards his right side (fig. 297). 4. Before commencing the operation, the skin in the neighbourhood of the amputation is shaved, most carefully cleaned with soap and brush, and afterwards thoroughly washed with a strong carbolic solution. 5. Narcosis being induced, the extremity is made bloodless to a point above the seat of amputation, and after the removal of the ban- dage again washed Avith the carbolic solution. 6. During the whole operation all the rules of antiseptic surgery are most rigidly followed (page 12). b. Division of the soft parts. The soft parts must be divided in such a way, that they give a plentiful covering to the sawn surfaces of the bones. The muscles are best cut through perpendicularly to the axis of the limb, for if the muscles are divided obliquely, the vessels are also divided obliquely, and cannot be easily and securely tied. For this reason, of all methods the circular operation and the method by skin-flaps with circular di- vision of the muscles are most to be recommended.

As it is here a question of covering larger surfaces of bone, flaps must be cut proportionately large, either of skin alone, or of skin and the subjacent muscles. 3. In many cases the most advantageous method is by a large anterior and a small posterior flap, as at the knee, shoulder, and hip. In some cases, as at the ankle, and tarsus, the posterior flap must be the larger. 4. The oval incision is especially suitable for small joints, as those of the fingers and toes. 5. After the division of the soft parts, the joint is opened; the bands of tissue, as they present themselves, being put upon the stretch by suitable movements, and then divided with the knife. 6. After the division of the remaining ligaments and the capsule of the joint, the disarticulation is completed; and finally the articular surface is removed with the saw. For the rest of the operation the proceeding is the same as in an amputation. III. THE AMPUTATIONS AND DISARTICULATIONS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. a. Disarticulation of the terminal phalanx. (By a palmar flap from without inwards.) 1. The hand being held towards him in the prone position, the operator seizes the tip of the finger, and flexes the terminal phalanx. 2. A semilunar incision, 21â„¢ below the top of the joint and carried across the head of the second phalanx, opens the joint (fig. 328). Fig. 328.

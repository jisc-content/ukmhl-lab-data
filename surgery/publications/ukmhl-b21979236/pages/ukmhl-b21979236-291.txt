2\7 4 While the left hand presses the foot more and more against the posterior aspect of the leg, and alternately twists it round its axis to one side or the other, the os ealeis is liberated from its heel flap; the tendo Achiliis is divided by incisions, which follow closely upon one another, and are made alternately from above, from the side, and finally from behind and below, but always cutting upon the bone (fig. 390). Pig. 390. SYME'S disarticulation (dissecting out the os caicis). Note. In secondary operations the calcaneus need not be dissected out with the knife, but can be conveniently shelled out from the periosteum with elevator and raspatory. 5. The heel flap is drawn upwards above the malleoli, whilst a circular incision, made just above the articular surface of the tibia, divides the remaining soft parts (tendons and periosteum). 6. The saw is applied to the bones, so as only to remove both malleoli and a thin layer of the articular cartilage of the tibia (fig. 391 and 392). The malleoli alone can be removed (as Symb has done several times) with a pair of cutting bone forceps.

The portion of ulna thus stripped is divided below the upper angle of the incision by a key-hole saw, or a strong pair of cutting bone forceps. 4. The piece is then seized with a pair of necrosis forceps, twisted out of the wound, and liberated by dividing the lig. laterale ulnarc and the lig. accessorium rectum (fig. 446 and 447). 5. A second longitudinal incision, dividing the skin, and beginning just below the styloid process of the radius, is carried upwards for 5â€”6cm on the outer side of the radius. 6. The tendons of the extensor brevis pollicis (primi internodii pollicis) and abductor longus pollicis (extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis), which run obliquely over the radius, are drawn towards the dorsum, while the band is forcibly extended upon the forearm (dorsal flexion) ! fig. 448). 1G*

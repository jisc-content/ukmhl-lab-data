190 3. The point of the knife divides the lateral ligaments, while the blade with the edge directed downwards, is sunk behind the flexor aspeel of the third phalanx (tig. 329), and cuts with a sawing movement a well rounded flap from the tissues on the flexor side (fig. 330). Fig- 329. Fig. 330. b. Disarticulation at the second phalangeal joint. (By transfixion from within outwards.) 1. The hand being held towards him in the supine position, the operator seizes the tip of the outstretched finger, transfixes with a narrow knife just below the fold of the joint, and carries the blade downwards between the skin and the bone with a sawing movement towards himself, far enough to furnish a well rounded flap (fig. 331). Fig. 331. Fig. 332. 2. The flap is tinned back, the joint hyperextended, and from the wound outwards the knife divides in one stroke the capsule, the liga- ments, and the skin upon the dorsal aspect of the joint (fig. 332).

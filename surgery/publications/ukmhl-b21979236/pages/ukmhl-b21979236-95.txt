75 e. For injuries of the upper arm, and especially simple fractures: a. Four wooden splints, padded, and applied by means of hand- kerchiefs (fig. 160), for fracture of the middle of the upper arm. The whole arm must be carefully bandaged, from the tips of the fingers upwards, and supported by a sling. The turns of the bandage must not ascend too high upon the inner side, as they readily produce strangulation in the axilla. [3. For fractures below the middle, a paste board trough (s. fig. 121), padded with cotton wool, is sufficient, of which the upper part reaches to the shoulder. A short paste board splint is also laid upon the inner side, and the whole is bandaged with a moistened gauze roller. y. The starch bandage for fracture of the upper arm is applied as follows: after the whole arm, in the position of abduction, has been very carefully ban- daged with moistened flannel rollers, four paste-board splints are applied, which have been previously moistened, smeared with starch, and padded; a short one is placed on the inner side, and the three longer ones in front, behind, and on the outer side, right up to and over the shoulder; and these are fixed by starch bandages, which also cover the shoulder (spica), but leave the axilla free. The arm, flexed at the elbow, is then carefully applied to the thorax and supported by a sling. 8. The plaster of Paris bandage with strips of wood, for fracture of the upper arm, and inflammation of the shoulder joint, is applied as follows. The arm, flexed at the elbow, and abducted at the shoulder, is carefully bandaged with flannel rollers to above the elbow joint; and from Chat point upwards the upper arm and shoulder are enve- loped in cotton wool. The whole arm, from the wrist to the shoulder, Splints for fracture of the upper arm.

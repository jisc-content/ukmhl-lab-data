225 Fig. 410. Amputation of the leg with lateral flaps. of the limb at the scat of ampu- tation (fig. 410). The representations of Volz's transverse sections are found on plate XXVIII, fig. I â€”III. Fig. I. Transverse section of the right log in its lower third. Fig. II. Transverse section of the right leg in its middle third. Fig. III. Transverse section of the right leg in its upper third. 0. Disarticulation of the leg at the knee by the circular method. 1. With the limb fully extended at the knee, the skin is divided by a circular incision 8cm below the patella. The skin is dissected up circularly as far as the lower border of the patella, and reflected like a cuff. 2. With the knee flexed, the ligamentum patella is first divided immediately below the patella, then the anterior part of the capsule and the lateral ligaments close to the edge of the femur, so that the semilunar cartilages and the greater part of the capsule remain attached to the tibia. 3. After the knee has been still more strongly flexed, the crucial ligaments are separated from the inner surfaces of both condyles. The knee is then again straightened, and the remaining soft tissues at the back of the joint are divided with one sweep of the knife from before backwards (fig. 411). A section of the left thigh through the condyles is represented on plate XXIX, fig. 1. Esmarch, the Surgeon's Handbook.

If a portion of an arti- cular extremity lias been shot off. it can be seized with Lakgenbbok's sharp hook (fig. 443) and drawn out of the wound. If it lias been shattered-, the separate fragments are seized with the forceps and extracted. 9. Since the reproduction of a joint is usually most complete, when only a part of the joint is removed, it is advisable, when the injury of an articular extre- mity is very extensive, to remove only the injured part, and to leave the rest intact (partial ex- cision). 10. Most excisions can be per- formed with great advantage by the bloodless method. After the operation is finished, all the bleeding vessels must be carefully ligatured, before the wound is closed: otherwise secondary haemorrhage easily arises, for which the dressing may have to be taken off, and the wound disturbed afresh. 11. In the after-treatment success depends before every thing else upon avoiding the retention and decomposition of the secretions of the wound, and upon the immobilisation of the limb. 12. The rigid rules of antiseptic surgery can in recent cases be employed with the most perfect success. By this treatment the whole wound frequently heals quickly and with exceedingly little sup- puration. 13. If the joint is already suppurating, then all the cavities of the wound, before it is closed, must be most carefully washed out with chloride of /ink, or strong carbolic solution, or with dilute hydro- chloric acid ( 1 per cent). In every case a free escape must be provided VOLKMANN'S sharp retractor.

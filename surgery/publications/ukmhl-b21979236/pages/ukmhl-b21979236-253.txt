J85 d. The arrest of haemorrhage. 1. All the divided vessels, arteries and veins, which can be re- cognized, and whose positions have been called to mind before the operation by the assistance of drawings, shewing transverse sections (plates XXVIâ€”XXX), are seized with artery forceps (plate XXIV). The forceps are allowed to hang, till no more gaping vessels can be found; all the vessels one after the other are then tightly and securely tied with carbolised catgut in a "reef knot" (fig. 22), not in a "granny" (fig. 23), since the latter easily becomes loose (fig. 322). The ends of the ligature are cut off about 3mm in front of the knot. Fig. 322. Fig. 323. Ligature with artery forceps hanging. Filo-pressure of an artery. 2. If a bleeding vessel cannot be well isolated and drawn for- ward for the purpose of applying the ligature, a ligature may be carried by a strongly curved needle through the soft parts, surrounding the bleeding point, and a small portion of the tissues together with the bleeding vessel included within the ligature (fig. 323). 3. If there is no antiseptic material at hand for the ligature, the arteries can be closed by torsion. The vessel is seized with a pair of artery forceps, drawn slightly forwards and twisted according to the size of the artery six to eight times upon its axis, while the central part of the piece, that is drawn forward, is fixed by the fingers or better

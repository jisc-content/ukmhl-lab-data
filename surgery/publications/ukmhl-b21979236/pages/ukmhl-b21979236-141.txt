\2\ 1) For the common carotid artery, the anterior part of the side of the neck, between the larynx and the inner border of the sterno- mastoid muscle, where the finger presses the artery against the verte- brae (fig. 249). Fig. 249. Digital compression of the carotid artery. 2) For the subclavian artery, the supra - clavicular fossa, where the artery at the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, and issuing from behind the scalenus anticus, is compressed against the first rib. By drawing forwards the shoulder and with it the clavicle, the artery is more easily reached by the finger (fig. 250). 3) For the axillary artery, the anterior fold of the axilla, where, when the arm is raised, the artery can be compressed against the head of the humerus. 4) For the brachial artery, the centre of the upper-arm, where the artery at the inner border of the biceps can be easily compressed against the humerus (fig. 251). 5) The abdominal aorta, when the abdominal walls are relaxed and the intestines empty, can be compressed against the vertebrae on a level with the umbilicus. The pressure here cannot however be borne for any length of time without a narcotic being employed.

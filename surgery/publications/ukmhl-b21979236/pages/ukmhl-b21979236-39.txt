19 THE BANDAGING must be done with great accuracy and care, for a badly applied bandage easily gets out of place, and by strangulation may produce considerable mischief. A bandage too tightly applied soon produces venous stasis; the parts below the seat of strangulation swell, become painful, blue, and cold, and if the cause be not soon removed, gangrene ensues. If bandages, applied dry. afterwards become wet (e. g. from cold wrappings) they Fig. 27. Fig. 28. shrink, and fre- quently produce strangulation. In bandaging one distinguishes the following passes or turns: 1. The circular bandage, whose turns are applied on one and the same level (fig.27, infra). 2. The rapidly ascending spiral (Schlangentour, dolabra repens) (fig. 27, supra). 3. The slowly ascending spiral (Hobelbinde, do- labra ascendens) Whose turns par- tially overlap The circular bandage and rapid spiral. each Other (fig. 28). 2*

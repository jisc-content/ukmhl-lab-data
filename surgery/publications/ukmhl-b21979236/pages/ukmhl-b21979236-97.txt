c c safety pins to a bandage, which is carried over the sound shoulder. The flexed arm is then placed upon it and together with the cushion is fixed by a sling (fig. 164)1 It secures a position of rest for the arm, whilst it hinders the transmission of the respiratory movements to the seat of fracture. The wounds are dressed with many tailed bandages, after the outer corners of the sling have been turned back. C If there be considerable swelling after severe shattering of the arm, the limb must be first of all raised; and for this purpose it is most conveniently placed upon a padded Stromeyetts arm-splint with a hole for the internal condyle of the humerus (s. fig. 140). T|. For fractures of the upper end of the humerus, with obstinate tilting outwards of the upper fragment, the whole of the upper arm must be placed in the abducted position by Middeldorpf's triangle, a triangular wedge-shaped cushion (fig. 165), or by a double inclined plane (fig. 166), framed out of three boards, whose longest side is fixed to the trunk by straps or handkerchiefs, whilst the arm bent to an obtuse angle is placed upon the two shorter sides, and fixed there by bandages. As oedema easily arises on account of the dependent- position of the arm, the whole arm must be very carefully bandaged from below upwards. Fig. 164.

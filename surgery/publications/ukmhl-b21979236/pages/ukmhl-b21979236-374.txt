294 7. With the head well thrown back, a cutaneous incision, 3â€”4cm in length, is made accurately in the middle line: this can be previously marked out by a coloured line. 8. The cellular tissue in the intermuscular space is raised between two forceps and divided, as described for the ligature (page 140). The sterno-hyoid muscles are separated with retractors (strabismus-hook or eye-speculum). 9. Any bleeding vessel is immediately tied; if necessary, the sur- rounding tissues are included within the ligature. If the operation has to be rapidly completed, the bleeding vessel is seized with artery forceps, and allowed to hang sideways. By this means the edges of the wound are at the same time drawn asunder. 10. If the isthmus of the thyroid body reaches up to the first ring of the trachea or to the thyroid cartilage, the deep cervical fascia is divided by a small transverse incision upon the middle of the cricoid cartilage, and liberated from the trachea by a director or a strabismus hook (fig. 518): in this manner the operator penetrates without loss Fig. 518. of blood behind the thyroid body and the plexus of veins (Bose's retro- fasciale Ablosung der Schilddruse). 11. As soon as the trachea is exposed, it must be well fixed, so that the anterior wall may be accurately and safely divided in the middle line. This is most easily done by a sharp hook (e. g. Lakgen- BECK'S double hook) (fig. 519 and 520), the point of which is fixed into the lower border of the highest cartilage. Whilst the trachea is thus drawn upwards and steadied, the operator places the knife upon the groove of the hook, and pierces the trachea to a depth of lcra: he then divides the anterior wall as far as it has been exposed. Great care must be taken to avoid cutting into the reflected tissue or the thyroid gland, for a violent haemorrhage might ensue, and the blood enter into the opened trachea. The thyroid body is therefore drawn down- wards with a strabismus hook.

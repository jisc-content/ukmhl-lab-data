2;').") from the tissues behind (von Langenbeck), and a transverse incision made in front below Poupart's ligament. But then a stout drainage tube must be pushed in towards the stumps of the divided psoas and iliacus, which retract into the cavity of pelvis, so that there may be no retention of pus. s. Reamputation. 1. If in an amputation sufficient soft parts have not been pre- served (to cover the end of the bone), or the soft parts have retracted during their healing in consequence of an inflammatory swelling (ostitis), or been destroyed by gangrene, a so called conical stump is formed (hg. 424), that is, the end of the bone projects so far forwards, that Fig. 424. Conical stump. cicatrisation is never completely accomplished (ulcus prominens), or the thin cicatrix, which is at last produced, breaks out again, as soon as the patient begins to use a wooden stump, or an artificial leg. The stumps, which are left after frost bite or a bad burn, are generally in a similar condition. 2. Formerly in such cases the limb was amputated again higher up, or an attempt made to cover the cicatrix by "skin grafting". But the former is generally unnecessary, and as dangerous to the life of the patient as the first amputation; while the latter rarely yields a satis- factory result, because the skin on the extremities is not very suitable for plastic operations.

\08 the pelvis, and on the inner side to the middle of the thigh, and rolled up as far as the perinaeum. To prevent the rolling of the leg from side to side, the boot can be employed as a foot-rest. For-this purpose it is cut open in the middle line in front, as far as the metatarso-phalangeal joints; from here a curved incision is carried on each side towards the front part of the heel, and the upper border of the leg of the boot is rolled up either upon a bundle of sticks, a narrow wooden splint, or upon the sword or bayonet of the wounded man, and fastened on both sides with some twine (fig. 231). Fig. 231. Regulation boot cut open and used'as a foot-rest. For the elastic extension a wooden splint can also be employed, which is composed of five separate pieces, each of which is provided at one end with a tin-socket for putting the splint together (fig. 232).

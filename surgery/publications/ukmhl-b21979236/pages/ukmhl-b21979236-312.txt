232 The anterior flap is brought down and adapted to the posterior, as i shewn in fig. 420. Fig. 420. Stump after disarticulation at the hip by the flap operation. [3. .Disarticulation at the hip by the circular method. 1. By a strong and rapid sweep of the knife a circular incision is made 12C1" below the top of the great trochanter, and all the soft parts together divided right down to the hone; the latter is then im- mediately sawn through. 2. All the vessels — arteries and veins — which can be recognized are seized with artery forceps and tied with catgut (see transverse section of the thigh in its upper third on plate XXX, fig. II). 3. In those cases, in which the bloodless method from some reason or other cannot be safely employed, it is advisable (Laukky), before the circular incision is made, to expose the femoral artery and vein in the iliofemoral triangle by a vertical incision. These are then each secured by two pairs of artery forceps, and the vessels divided between the two: the lower ends are ligatured, but the upper ends are turned up- wards, and left till the amputation is finished (fig. 421).

*93 A larger half-oval flap, the fciase of which is on a level with the joint, is cut from the integu- ments on the palmar, dorsal, or lateral aspect of the first phalanx, and turned back. 2. A smaller skin flap is then formed on the opposite side, and likewise reflected. 3. Finally the tendons are divided on a level with the joint, which is then freely opened (fig. 336). â€¢ NB. The drawing shews the dis- articulation for the ring finger with two lateral flaps, and the oval incision for the middle finger. Fig. 337. d. Disarticulation of the thumb at the carpo- metacarpal joint. a. By the oval incision. 1. The first incision begins on the ulnar side of the first phalanx on a level with the web, and is carried obliquely over the metacarpo- phalangeal joint as far as the radial side of the metacarpal bone, and is continued along the same side to its base. 2. The second incision, start- ing from the same point, is car- ried round on to the radial side, and meets with the first at the middle of the metacarpal bone (fig. 337). 1 3. By repeated incisions on the bone in the same direction it is liberated from the muscles. 4. The joint between the trapezium and the metacarpal bone is opened on the ulnar side, so that the edge of the knife is kepi dose upon the base of the latter, and thus the joint between the meta- Ermarch, the Surgeon's Handbook.

214 h. Subastragaloid disarticulation (Malgaigne). Fig. 382. Fig. 381. 1. Two lateral flaps are formed by an incision, widen commences behind immediately above the great tuberosity of the os calcis and divides the tendo Achillis. The incision then runs over the lower half of the os calcis with a wide bend below the external malleolus (fig. 380); from here it ascends transver- sely over the middle of the cuboid to the dorsum of the foot; it is carried down vertically (fig. 382) over the anterior edge of the scaphoid (fig. 381) to the inner side, till it reaches the centre of the sole of the foot (fig. 383). At this point it turns directly backwards at a right angle, and meets the commencement of the incision at the inner border of the tendo Achillis. Fig. 380. Fig. 383.

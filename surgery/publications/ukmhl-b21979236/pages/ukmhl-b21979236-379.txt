299 adherent to the costal pleura. In doubtful cases the diagnosis can be confirmed by aspiration with Pkavazs syringe. 11. At this spot an incision, 3 â€”4cm in length, is made close along the upper border of the lower rib, as the intercostal artery and nerve run along the lower border of the upper rib (fig. 524). Here the incisions are carefully carried towards the pleura till the pus makes its appearance. The opening is then enlarged, so that a free outlet it secured. 12. If the intercostal space is too narrow, e. g. from the formation of callus, the periosteum is divided at the upper border of the nearest rib, and raised with a narrow elevator; a sufficiently large piece of the bone is then excised with cutting forceps or chain saw. 13. In the same manner a piece of the sternum can be excised, if it appears necessary for the free escape of the contents of the pleural cavity. But it must not be forgotten, that the internal mammary artery runs down behind the costal cartilages at a distance of about lcm from the margin of the sternum (fig. 524). N. SUTURES FOR THE INTESTINE. 1. A wound in a piece of intestine, that has been protruded, must be closed by the suture, before an attempt is made to replace it. 2. As it is only the serous surfaces of the intestine that can grow together, they must be brought in contact with one another by the suture. 3. In simple longitudinal or transverse wounds, the edges of the wound are turned a little inwards all round, and the folded margins stitched together with a fine round suture-needle and a fine linen or silk thread, by carrying every stitch through the wall of the bowel for about 4mm between the mucous membrane and the muscular layer (Lembert's intestine suture) (fig. 525). 4. The continuous or glover's suture can also be used with good results (fig. 526).

W8 Plate VII. Ligature of the subclavian artery in the left infra-clavicular fossa. 1. The shoulder is drawn upicards. 2. The cutaneous incision is 6â€”8cm long, beginning from the cor- acoid process and running parallel with the outer half of the clavicle. It exposes the triangular space between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, through which the cephalic vein passes to reach the subclavian vein. 3. The cephalic vein is drawn outwards with the border of the deltoid muscle, the border of the pectoralis major (which may, if necessary be detached somewhat from the clavicle) is drawn inwards. 4. After the division of some adipose tissue the coraco - clavicular fascia appears at the bottom of the wound: this is cautiously divided. The external thoracic artery will generally require a ligature. 5. The pectoralis minor is seen, whose inner (upper) border forms with the subclavian muscle an angle open on the inner side. In this angle the artery lies deeply placed between the brachial plexus and the subclavian vein: the vein is to the inner side, and the nerve to the outer side. NB. If hecessary the pectoralis minor can be detached from the coracoid process, and the artery tied further towards the axilla.

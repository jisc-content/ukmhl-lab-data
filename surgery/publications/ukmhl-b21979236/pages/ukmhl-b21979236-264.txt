J96 2. An incision is made upon the back of the hand, which, be- ginning from the web of the thumb, is carried obliquely upwards to the upper third of the second metacarpal bone. From there it is con- tinued transversely over the three last metacarpal bones, till it meets the palmar flap at the ulnar border of the hand (fig. 344). 3. After both flaps have been reflected as far as the carpo-meta- carpal joints, the latter are opened from the ulnar side during a strong abduction of the hand, till the second metacarpal bone is disarticulated from the trapezium. In this latter part of the operation great care must be taken to cut always upon these two bones, so as to avoid injuring the joint between the trapezium and the metacarpal bone of the thumb. 4. The preservation of the thumb is an immense advantage (fig. 345).

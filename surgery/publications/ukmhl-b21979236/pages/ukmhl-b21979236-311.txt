251 Fig. 419. f 4. The capsule is opened by an incision, which is made with some force by means of a small knife, placed at right angles to the surface upon the head of the femur (as if with the intention of cutting through the head and leaving the upper part in the acetabulum, Lisfkakc), while the limb is forcibly carried into hyperextension, and rotated outwards. With a cracking noise the air enters the joint, and the head starts from the acetabulum; an incision upon the ligamentum teres allows it be completely protruded. 5. The operator seizes the head of the femur, draws it forwards, and divides the posterior wall of the capsule, the muscles attached to the great trochanter, and all the soft parts, which have been left till now undivided. 6. One end of a stout drainage tube is placed in the acetabulum, while the other end is brought out through the centre of the wound.

« dages, which are fastened to the buttons found on both sides of the bath. This method of abstracting heat is especially suitable for recent injuries of the hands and feet. It does not require a very low tem- perature, for the action of the permanent bath is very energetic. Water from 16 — 18 E. (68 — 72lj2 F.), by a long duration in the bath, produces a very perceptible cooling effect. The regulation of the temperature, by pouring in cold water, can generally be left to the patient himself. For keeping septic matters from the wound, dressings for pro- curing complete closure are employed, as well as Lister's antiseptic method of dressing. E. THE HERIETICAL SEALING OF WOUNDS. Hermetical sealing, aims at producing a dry scab upon a recent wound, which remains firmly adherent till cicatrisation ensues. Open wounds can by this treatment heal without suppuration, like sub- cutaneous ones, and when successful, putrefaction is avoided. This method is successful: 1. in superficial injuries; scratches, burns, abraisons etc., by pow- dering with flour, charcoal, chalk, potters clay, gum arabic; by drying the surface with a stream of air (from a pair of bellows); by slight corrosion with caustic or carbolic acid; or by covering with cotton wool; 2. in deeper complicated wounds (with fracture, injury to a joint etc.); by covering the bloody wound with clean and disinfected wool, teased charpie, lint, or german-tinder, which form with the blood a dry crust. Over this a thick layer of cotton-wool is laid, and over all a water- proof material is fastened with a moistened gauze-bandage.

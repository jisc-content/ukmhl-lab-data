The sharp edge of the sawn surface must be taken off with the saw or the cutting hone forceps. 5. The method of trying to make the patella, after its articular surface has been removed with the saw, unite with the sawn surface of the condyles (Gkitti), does not appear to have any especial value. q. Amputation of the thigh. a. By llie. single circular incision (page 174). [3. By flic double circular incision (page 175). 7. By the flap operation (page 178). Volz's transverse sections of the thigh are represented on plate XXIX. tig. II, and plate XXX, fig. I and II. Plate XXIX, fig. II. Transverse section of the right thigh in its lower third. Plate XXX, fig. I. Transverse section of the right thigh in its middle third. Plate XXX. fig. II. Transverse section of the right thigh in its upper third. A method, for changing the dressing alter amputation of the thigh, which I have seen employed by Volkmann, is to he recommended. The patient is raised, and a block of wood or a hard cubical cushion covered with india-rubber is pushed beneath the buttock of the sound side, so that the stump during the change of dressing swings free and need not be held. By this method the back above the sacrum is also tree, so that the turns of a spica-bandage, which fix on the dressing, can be easily carried round the body (fig. 416).

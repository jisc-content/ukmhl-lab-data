U8 towards the brain. On the same principle in compression of the chest the left elbow must every time be forcibly pressed against the cardiac region. Although the respiratory and cardiac movements be not soon restored, yet the efforts must not be given up too early. There are well known cases, in which artificial respiration continued for three or four hours succeeded in calling back the life that was passing away. 20. In such cases too, by pressing both electrodes of an induction apparatus one on each side into the hollow depression above the cla- vicle at the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, so that both phrenic nerves and the other inspiratory nerves of the brachial plexus are stimulated by the current, we can try to set the inspiratory muscles again in action. * 21. If vomiting occurs during the narcosis, the head is turned immediately to one side, so as to prevent the entrance of the vomit into the air passages. 22. If the patient is much exhausted and faint, a glass of strong wine is given shortly before the administration of chloroform. 23. If there is much exitement in the first stage, too much force must not be used to restrain the patient. It is better to give him a subcutaneous injection of morphia. B. ARREST OF HAEMORRHAGE. Violent haemorrhage from recent wounds endangers the life of the patient and must be immediately arrested; this object is best fulfilled by the ligature of the wounded vessel. But if this is not at once practicable, as for instance in the stress of work on the battle field, then some other method can be adopted. 1, TEMPORARY ARREST OF HAEMORRHAGE. a) Firstly, the direct compression of the wound. a. By the pressure of the finger or hand. In many cases this can be carried out by the patient himself. As however pressure with the * Electro-puncture of the heart advocated hy Steiner is not to be recommended; and would scarcely do more service than the direct compression of the cardiac region during the artificial respiration.

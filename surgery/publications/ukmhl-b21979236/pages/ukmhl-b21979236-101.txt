through again to the front under the sound shoulder, as far as the mamma. The second strip fixes the arm and raises it forwards. It starts from the summit of the sound shoulder, and is carried obliquely down- wards over the back, round the elbow of the injured side to the front, and upwards again to the sound shoulder. The centre of the third strip supports the wrist, while the two ends are carried over the broken cla- vicle, so that the weight of the arm presses down the fragments of the bone, which are tilted upwards. A small sling supports the hand. Fig. 173. Bandaging the whole leg. Etmarch, the Surgeon's Handbook. Q. DRESSINGS FOR THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 1. BANDAGING THE WHOLE LEG (fig. 173). This is commenced by ban- daging the foot with a (narrow) figure of eight (stirrup, stapes). The leg is then bandaged by a broader ascending spiral with reverses, the knee by a figure of eight (testudo), the thigh by an ascending spiral with re- verses, and the hip by a figure of eight (spica coxae), which is finished off with a few circular turns round the lower part of the abdomen.

Plate IX. Ligature of the brachial artery in the middle of the right arm. 1. The cutaneous incision is 4cm in length along the inner border of the biceps. 2. The biceps is drawn outwards with a retractor. The median nerve is seen lying immediately upon the artery. 3. The median nerve is detached from the sheath and drawn outwards by a strabismus hook; the sheath of the artery is opened: it lies between two veins (venae comites). NB. Sometimes the brachial artery divides into the ulna and radial arteries in the upper third of the arm; the latter in that case commonly runs more superficially and towards the outer side (upon the biceps), while the former then appears conspicuously small.

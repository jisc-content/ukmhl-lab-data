Ligaments of the ankle joint (inner side). 265 the anterior surface, and with the tendinous sheaths of the flexors from the posterior sur- face of the tibia, and finally the internal la- teral ligament is divi- ded from the extre- mity of the malleolus (fig. 480). 6. The tibia is sawn through at the upper end of the vertical inci- sion with a key-hole or chain saw (in an ob- lique direction on ac- count of the limited space): the piece is seized with necrosis forceps, and while the elevator from above pushes the periosteal surface of the interosseous ligament away, it is slowly twisted out of the wound. NB. The preservation of the interosseous membrane is very important for the regeneration of the bQne (Langenbeck). 7. The bone is now only held fast by the anterior and posterior attachments of the capsular ligament. These are divided with the knife; in doing which the tendon of the tibialis posticus must not be injured. 8. If the operator wishes to remove the upper articular surface of the astragalus, it is done with the key-hole saw, which works in the direction of the semilunar incision from before backwards, while the foot is steadied with two hands against the table. Langenbeck advises the upper articular surface of the astragalus to be sawn immediately after the removal of the fibula from the first incision, but to be taken out only after the removal of the tibia with the elevator. 9. After the haemorrhage has been arrested, a stout drainage tube is drawn through the lower part of the wound, which is closed except at this spot with sutures. By one of the methods described Fig. 480.

l ROLES FOR THE LIGATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARTERIES. Plate III. Ligature of the left common carotid artery on a level with the crico- thyroid ligament. 1. The head is thrown backwards, by a pillow placed beneath the shoulders. 2. The cutaneous incision is 6cm in length, along the inner border of the sterno-mastoid, beginning on a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. 3. The platysma and the cellular tissue (avoiding the superficial veins) are divided. 4. The omohyoid muscle is drawn downwards. 5. The descendens noni nerve, which runs downwards upon the artery, is drawn outwards. 6. The common sheath is opened over the middle of the artery. The artery lies to the inner side, the internal jugular vein to the outer side but somewhat superficial, and the vagus nerve lies behind and between the two. 7. The needle is passed round from without inwards.

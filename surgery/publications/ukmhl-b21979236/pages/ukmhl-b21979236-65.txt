45 Fig. 79. WYWODZOFF'S machine for plaster of Paris bandages. 13. As an application beneath the plaster of Paris bandages, cotton wool can be suitably employed, as it is the best means of averting pressure and strangulation (fig. 80). Fig. 80. The plaster of Paris applied over cotton wool. 14. Moistened gauze bandages (Roser), or dry flannel rollers can also be employed for the same purpose in compound fractures, as well as flannel or gauze bandages soaked in carbolic oil (10 per cent): the latter do not easily become impregnated with the secretions from the wound (Bardeleben). 15. To make the edges of the plaster of Paris bandage smooth and even, the bandage beneath, which projects somewhat, can be turned over like a frill, and fixed by a turn of the plaster of Paris bandage (fig. 81). 16. To make the plaster of Paris bandage stronger, a layer of the plaster-cream can be smeared over the bandage. But it will thus become very thick and heavy. 17. To give it greater firmness, it is better to introduce shavings, wooden splints, or iron wire, as they last longer and can be easily removed.

\25 6) The same may be said of the external iliac artery in its upper part, where it can be compressed against the brim of the pelvis. It can be compressed more easily and for a longer time against the upper border of the horizontal ramus of the pubes, shortly before its exit from the pelvis above the middle of Pouparts ligament. 7) The femoral artery is most securely compressed just below Pouparts ligament against ileo-pectineal eminence (fig. 252). It is found in the centre of a line drawn from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the symphysis pubis. As far as the Lower third of the thigh it can be compressed against the femur; but digital compression is difficult and uncertain on account of the thickness of the intervening soft parts, at least in fat or muscular subjects. As the digital compression for any length of time can only be carried out by a skilled and powerful hand, and as a rule cannot be continued during a long transport, surgeons have attempted to supply its place by various other contrivances. To these belong: (3. Tourniquets, amongst which Petit's screw tourniquet (fig. 253) is the one most commonly used; by this instrument the pressure, which Fig. 253. PETIT'S screw tourniquet.

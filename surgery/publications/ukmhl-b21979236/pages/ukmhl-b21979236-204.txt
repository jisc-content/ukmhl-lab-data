\56 Plate XV. Ligature of the femoral artery (common femoral) below Poupart's ligament (right). 1. The cutaneous incision commences at a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, 211,111 above Poupart's ligament, and is carried downwards for 5C111. 2. The superficial fascia is divided. 3. The subcutaneous tissue is divided; the lymphatic glands arc avoided, by drawing them on one side or by removing them. 4. Division of the fascia lata. 5. The sheath of the vessel is opened, lcm below Poupart's ligament (because immediately below it the superticial epigastric and superficial circumflex iliac arteries are given off). 6. The femoral vein lies on the inner side of the artery, the anterior crural nerve on the outer side.

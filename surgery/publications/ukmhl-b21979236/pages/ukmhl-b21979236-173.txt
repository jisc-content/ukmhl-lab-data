M5 Plate IV. Ligature of the left common carotid artery between the two heads of the sterno-mastoid muscle. 1. The cutaneous incision is made 6cm in length between the two heads of the sterno-mastoid downwards to the clavicle, and 2cm to the outer side of the sterno-clavicular articulation. 2. The platysma is divided; the interval between the sternal and clavicular portions of the sterno-mastoid muscle is widened with the fingers, till the internal jugular vein is visible. 3. The vein with the clavicular portion of sterno-mastoid is drawn carefully outwards by the finger of an assistant, the sternal portion together with the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles is drawn inwards. 4. To the inner side of the vein appears the vagus nerve, some- what further inwards and deeper lies the artery. Efmarch, the Surgeon's Ilundbook; io

269 Fig. 486. Fig- 487- Inner side. Outer side. Ligaments of the right knee joint. 4. The knee is flexed, and while it is being again slowly extended, the patella is dislocated outwards by pressure applied with some force. 5. The crucial ligaments are divided: to separate the posterior crucial ligament from the spine of the tibia, the latter must be ro- tated outwards. 6. The external lateral ligament, with the corresponding part of the capsule, is divided by a semilunar incision, which is carried a few lines below the tip of the external epicondyle (fig. 487). 7. The joint gapes widely open; the posterior part of the capsule is divided; the articular ends of the femur and tibia are forced out of the wound one after the other and sawn oil'. 8. If the operator wishes to remove the patella, the edge of its cartilaginous surface is cut off all round with the knife, and then liberated with raspatory and elevator from its periosteum, so that the latter may remain connected with the ligamentum patella? and the extensor tendon.

40 abundance of starch paste, and lastly the whole is covered with a dry calico bandage. 7. Two or three clays elapse before a starch bandage is quite dry and hard; by exposing it to the heat of the sun or a stove, its drying can be hastened. 8. To render it capable of removal (amovo-inamovibel) the ban- dage is cut open throughout its whole length with a strong pair of scissors, and the casing bent asunder, while strips of calico bandage are pasted on the edges with starch. The casing is then reapplied and fastened with straps and buckles (fig. 71). Fig. 71. Starch bandage cut open. 2. THE SILICA (WASSERGLAS) BANDAGE. 1. If bandages are soaked in a concentrated solution of silicate of potassium (Kali-Wasserglas), which must have a specific gravity of 1*35â€”1-40 (Bohm), bandages can be produced, which become perfectly firm and hard, as soon as the water has evaporated. 2. To hasten its stiffening, finely pulverised chalk, or slaked lime and chalk (1:10, Boijm), magnesite (Konjg), or cement (Mitsciieiu.icii) is stirred in the silica, till a cream-like fluid is produced, of the consi- stence of honey, in which the bandages are dipped, or with which the bandages are smeared after their application by means of a large brush. Lastly the whole bandage is sprinkled Avith the dry powder, and well rubbed.

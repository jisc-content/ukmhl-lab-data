267 3. The posterior part of the capsule is carefully separated from - the femur, which is then pressed forward. The whole of the cartilage is sawn off in a direction parallel with its articular surface. 4. In the same manner the articular surface of the tibia is removed with the saw, without injuring the fibular joint, which does not as a rule communicate with the knee joint. 5. The patella is carefully liberated and separated from the qua- driceps extensor. The upper synovial pouch must also be dissected out, if it is inflamed or has undergone degeneration. 6. Both articular ends can be conveniently bored (tig. 483) obliquely through in many places by a fine drill with an eye at its point, and Fig. 483. Bone -drill. fastened together by silver wire or strong catgut ligatures. 7. After the haemorrhage has been arrested, a stout drainage tube is placed behind the bones across the wound, and brought out at the angles. The rest of the wound is carefully united with sutures, and the limb well adapted and fixed by one of the methods described on pages 90—93. XII, SUBPERIOSTEAL EXCISION OF THE KNEE JOINT, With Langenjjeck'o curved lateral incision. 1. On the inner side ot the extended joint a curved incision is made, 15—18cm in length, with the convexity backwards over the posterior border of the internal condyle. It commences 5—6c,n above the patella at the inner border of the rectus femoris, and terminates 5 —6cm below the patella on the inner side of the crest of the tibia (% 484).

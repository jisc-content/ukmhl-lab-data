8) An india-rubber tube about the size of goose-quill is sufficient to arrest the circulation in a finger: it is applied as represented m plate II, fig. 2. 9) A similar tube can be used for the root of the penis and scro- tum, if an operation is to be performed without loss of blood on the male organs of generation (fig. 267). Fig. 267. Elastic ligature for the penis and scrotum. 10) For disarticulations and excisions of the shoidder the tube must be fixed by a strong hand over the spine of the scapula, after it has been carried with considerable traction under the axilla to the summit of the shoulder (fig. 268), or it must be fixed by a clasp (fig. 269). By drawing the ends towards the neck, they are prevented from slipping. 11) For high amputation of the thigh the tube is wound once or twice round the thigh immediately below the groin, the ends are cros- sed over the groin, carried round the posterior aspect of the pelvis, mimI finally hooked together over the hypogastric region by means of a chain (fig. 270). 9*

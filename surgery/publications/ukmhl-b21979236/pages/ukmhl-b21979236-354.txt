274 Fig. 494. 5. From this incision, by alternately using the ele- vator and knife, the pe- riosteum together with the capsular ligament and the insertion of the obturator externus is separated all round from the neck of the femur (fig. 494). 6. The cartilaginous rim is then divided, and a piece removed with the knife on both sides of the incision. 7. The limb being now adducted and rotated in- wards, the head of the femur Ligaments on the anterior aspect of the hip joint. starts from the acetabulum with a cracking sound. 8. A long narrow knife is introduced into the joint from the posterior and outer side, and divides the stretched ligamentum teres by an incision carried inwards and forwards against the head of the femur. Whereupon the entire head can be protruded from the wound and, as above described, sawn off. 9. If the neck of the femur is injured by the bullet, the head must be fixed and manipulated with excision forceps, a sharp hook, or a bullet-extractor (fig. 508). 10. If the great trochanter is also injured, a piece of it must be removed with the neck by an oblique section of the saw. 11. After the haemorrhage has been arrested, a stout drainage tube is laid in the acetabulum and brought out through the centre of the wound. The rest of the wound is closed with sutures. 12. An extension is then immediately applied (page 101), and the counter-extension effected by raising the end of the bed. 13. In the after-treatment, it is most difficult to change the dressing without putting the extension out of order.

c. Disarticulation of the fingers at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. a. The oval incision. 1. An assistant separates the two adjacent fingers, and the operator standing on the left side of the limb, with his back to the patient's face, takes with his left hand the injured finger, and carries it far enough into hyperextension, to see its palmar surface. A narrow knife is then brought fro% the right side on to the palmar surface of the first phalanx; the soft parts being divided transversely on a level with the extended web, the incision is carried round the right side on to the dorsal surface, and from here upwards in a slight curve on to the head of the metacarpal bone (the position of which has been previously indicated by a mark) (fig. 333).

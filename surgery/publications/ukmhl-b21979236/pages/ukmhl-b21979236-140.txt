\20 For recent wounds are generally violently irritated by these remedies, or even cauterised. In any case they are only effectual in combination with the direct compression. Only such styptics should be employed, which have at the same time an antiseptic action. To these belong, the liquor ferri perchloridi (especially in the form of cotton wool im- pregnated with the solution), tannin (lately much recommended as antiseptic by Graf), creosote as Acpaa Binelli (1 : 100 water), and oil of turpentine (Baum , Billroth). An endeavour is made to bring these remedies in as direct contact as possible with the bleeding point, by first pressing a tampon soaked in the styptic to the bottom of the wound, and then proceeding as described in the application of the tampon. e. The red-hot iron, which formerly enjoyed a great reputation as a means of arresting haemorrhage, in no way deserves this con- fidence, since the escar produced by it is readily torn off by the iron, unless the latter be at a white heat. It is especially suitable for the arrest of parenchymatous haemorrhage, such for example as is met with in hospital gangrene or in thromboses of veins (Stromeyer's phle- bostatische Blutungen). Should the cauterising irons not be at hand, they can be easily extemporised out of pieces of telegraph wire, by rolling up one end in a spiral form, filing the other end to a point, and pushing it into a piece of wood to serve as a handle (fig. 247 and 248). Improvised cautery of telegraph wire after BRANDIS. b) Compression of the artery above the wound. a. Digital compression. This can only be successfully carried out in those cases, in which a fixed point of resistance is afforded by the bone. The following are the principal places, where digital pressure can be employed:

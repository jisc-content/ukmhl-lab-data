\87 6 M in spite of this treatment the parenchymatous haemorrhage continues, LI can soon be arrested by raising the stump, by pressure with a large sponge, by digital compression of the arterial trunk (v. Langenbeck), or by the application of the induced current to the surface of the wound (Riedinger). Fig. 326. e. The closure of the wound. The wound must not be closed before the haemorrhage has en- tirely ceased. Drai- nage tubes (s. fig. 1) are then placed at the bottom of the wound, with the ends pro- jecting one at each angle. The edges of the wound are care- fully adapted to one another, and accura- tely united with nu- merous sutures of carbolised silk, silver wire, or catgut, which are alternately passed deeply and superfici- ally through the flaps (fig. 326). The amputation wound closed with sutures. f. The dressing of the stump. After the ends of the drainage tube have been cut off on a level with the wound, and provided with silk threads to prevent then from slipping in, a narrow strip of "protective" is placed upon the edges of the wound, and over this a broader strip of Lister's gauze moistened with tin: carbolic solution. An uniform compression of the slump is exer- cised by similar strips, which are placed in all directions upon the wound and then fastened with a Lister's gauze bandage (fig. 327).

Since the extension, either by weight or by suspension, is not well fitted for transport from the battle field, the author has pro- posed to make use of "the extension by elastic rings", which can be made in the following manner. To fasten the small board, used for extension, to the sole of the foot, in default of Crosby's strapping, two moist bandages can be used, each of which is double the length of the whole limb: and in the middle of these bandages a small slit is cut, through which is put the ring of the small foot-board. Thus four free ends are attached to the small board, of w.hich two in front and two behind are wound in spiral turns round the limb (fig. 227).

If there is some starch or flour at hand, the fastening can be made more secure by being smeared with either of these materials. For the elastic extension either the india-rubber rings, which are commonly sold, are used, or in default of these, pieces of india-

49 traction upon the wound; these turns are then brought back again to the starting point, and the same process repeated several times. 6. The sagittal bandage (fascia sagittalis) (fig. 88) — a f bandage — is especially suitable for transverse wounds of the scalp. Fig. 87. Fig. 88. Fig. 89. Double-headed roller. Sagittal bandage. Knotted bandage. Fig. 90. c. The knotted bandage (fascia nodosa) (fig. 89) is a double-headed roller, whose turns are crossed at right angles upon the wound, and tightly drawn, as in tying up a parcel (Packknoten). It is especially suitable for haemorrhage, where considerable pressure is required. For the same purpose, a tightly stretched cravat or a piece of india-rubber bandage may be used. d. The lialtev bandage (capistrum) (fig. 90). The first turn begins on the top of the head, crosses the cheek by passing under the chin, and returns to the vertex. From here the second turn runs backwards round the occiput: it is then carried from the nape of the neck to the front round the anterior surface of the chin: lastly it returns to the nape of the neck, and ascends again to the vertex. After these have been repeated twice or three times, the third turn brings it to a conclusion by forming a circle from forehead to occiput. NB. This bandage, as well as the following one, is to be especially recom- mended as an excercise, for its individual turns can be used for various dressings. Moreover they are both best applied with wet gauze bandages. Esmarch, the Surgeon's Handbook. 4 The halter bandage.

Fig. 522. Pig. 523. 296 13. Instead of the double hook, two small hooks can be used for fixing the trachea, or still better two clutch forceps with a sliding catch (fig. 522), which are fastened on both sides into the wall of the trachea, and the margins of the cleft drawn apart at the moment when the knife enters. 14. If there is no canula at hand, a stout drainage tube, the lower end of which lias been cut off obliquely, is inserted; or two hooks are quickly made out of silver wire, as shewn in fig. 523, and introduced Clutch forceps with sliding catch. Wire hook. one on each side into the tracheal opening; these are kept apart by an elastic tape round the neck. 15. If there is nothing of the kind at hand, a ligature or silver wire is drawn through under one of the rings of the trachea with a curved needle; both ligatures are stretched by an elastic tape carried round the neck, so that the wound is kept gaping. 16. Such a makeshift must be replaced as soon as possible by a canula, if the trachea has to be kept open for any length of time. 17. If blood has entered the trachea, it can be sucked out with an elastic catheter. â€¢ 18. An endeavour is made with forceps to extract bullets or other foreign bodies, which have entered the air passages. 19. The operation being concluded, the anterior surface of the neck is covered with a few layers of moistened gauze, and the inner canula from time to time taken out, and the mucus removed by a soft feather.

287 knob of which acquires a black speck by contact with lead, or by Lecomte-Luers- stylet pince, with which a si nail piece oi lead can be nipped off from the bullet, or lastly by Liebreich-s electrical galvanic bullet probe (fig. 511), which moves the needle of a galvanometer as soon as both points of the insulated probe (a), or of the forceps (c), come in contact with a metallic body. 12. If the bullet can not be felt from the wound, but is beneath the skin at a distant part, having been previously well steadied with the fingers, it is cut down upon with a sharp knife; the cellular tissue is pushed aside with a probe or dressing forceps, and the ball extracted with bullet force]>s. If here again there is any doubt as to whether it is a ball or a piece of bone, that is felt, accurate information can be obtained by the introduction of two steel needles provided with handles (acupunc- ture-needles, fig. 511, b), which are connected, with Liebreicips bullet detector. 13. If Liebreich-s apparatus is not at hand, a similar one can be improvised (after Longmore) out of a copper coin, and a piece of zink folded together, which are separated from one another by a piece of flannel dipped in dilute acid. One of the two insulated copper wires, which end in the acupuncture-needles, is wound several times round a pocket-compass. The needle of the compass moves as soon as the circuit is completed by contact with the ball (fig. 512). 14. Splinters of bone entirely detached, pieces of clothing, and other foreign bodies, which are found during the examination, must be carefully extracted. If there are any abscesses and sinuses, an attempt is made to penetrate into them, and their orifices enlarged with the finger or forceps: counter-openings are also made at con- venient places by making the skin project from within with a thick

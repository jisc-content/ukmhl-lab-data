The whole leg is again firmly bandaged with a linen roller from the tips of the toes almost to the upper end of the first strip of plaster, which is turned backwards over the highest turn of the ban- dage (fig. 217). Fig. 217. CROSBY'S strapping. 2.

Extension by weight for fractures of the thigh. (A satchel filled with stones here serves as a weight.)

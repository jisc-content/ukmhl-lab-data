283 As soon as the teeth of the saw have penetrated to the depth of a few millimetres, the pin is withdrawn into the crown of the trephine. 10. The sawing must he interrupted from time to time, partly to examine the depth of the groove made by the saw with the Hat end of a probe, or with a quill obliquely sharpened to a point, and partly to free the teeth of the saw from bone dust by brushing and washing with carbolised water. 11. If the bone is completely cut Fig. 503. through at one spot, the teeth of the trephine must not here penetrate any deeper, but (by inclining the crown) be made to press only at the place,- IB^^l where the internal table has not yet been divided. A small bone screw is previously introduced into the central bore hole (Heine's tirefond) (fig. 503). 12. As soon as the disk of bone is freed all round, it is carefully lifted out by putting a hook, bent to a right angle, into the upper opening of the bone screw. With the same hook the operator also tries whether the depres- sed fragment can be moved (Roser), Bone screw with roser's hook. .inc| endeavours to raise it with the same instrument, a stronger lever, or a pair of forceps, or even entirely to remove it. 13. If during the operation haemorrhage should occur from ab- normally large veins in the diploe, it is arrested by the pressure of a ball of carbolised wax, softened in hot water, or by the introduction of a piece of catgut (Riedinger). Haemorrhage from the middle meningeal artery can also be arrested by the pressure of a ball of wax, if the divided artery cannot possibly be seized and ligatured. Haemorrhage from a wounded sinus usually ceases after the application of a light compress. 14. Before commencing the operation, the scalp must be shaved for some distance round (it is best to shave the whole), and most carefully cleansed with soap and brush, and disinfected with a solution of carbolic acid.

164 C. BLOOD-LETTING (VENAESECTIO, PHLEBOTOMIE). 1. As a rule the vein, which projects most prominently at the fold of the elbow, is opened for the abstraction of blood. 2. In most cases this is the median basilic vein. But since it almost always crosses the brachial artery, and is only separated from it by the bicipital fascia, it is advisable, before beginning the operation, to feel for the pulsation of the artery and to make the opening in the vein either above or below the point of crossing. 3. The patient should be in a recumbent position and allow the arm to hang, so that the veins may fill. 4. A bandage (or a folded handkerchief) is tied round the middle of the upper arm, tightly enough to prevent the return of the venous blood, but not enough to interrupt the arterial current (the radial artery must not cease pulsating). The knot of the bandage is so tied, that it may be loosened by pulling at the end, which hangs down. 5. The operator fixes the arm by clasping it between his own upper arm and his chest, the vein is steadied by the pressure of his thumb below the point of puncture. Fig. 286. 6. A puncture, is made through the skin into the vein with a Venesection with the lancet. lancet (fig. 286), or Lorinser's phlebotoine (plate XXIII). This is enlarged by raising the point in such a way. that the anterior wall of the vein is divided in an oblique direction for about bmm. 7. The blood must issue in a forcible jet; if the stream becomes slow, it can be assisted by alternately opening and shutting the hand.

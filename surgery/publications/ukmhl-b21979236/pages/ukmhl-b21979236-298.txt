224 concave surface, and the bones of the leg a corresponding convexity (fig. 408). S. By this method the stump receives a very broad basis of support for walking (fig. 409). Fig. 408. Fig. 409. The bones sawn through in BRUNS' operation. Stump after LE FORT'S operation. n. Amputations of the leg. a. By double circular incision (page 175). [3. By skin flaps (page 178). Amputation by two lateral skin flaps is especially suitable for the lower third of the leg (above the malleoli) (fig. 179). An .'interior skin flap soon suffers from pressure against tin" sharp edge of the sawn tibia. A posterior skin flap draws the edges of the wound asunder by its weight. One lateral flap with a semi-circular incision on the opposite side (Langenbeck) is a very convenient form of amputation for the upper two thirds of the leg. It is only necessary to recollect, that the base of the skin flap must be somewhat smaller than hall' the circumference

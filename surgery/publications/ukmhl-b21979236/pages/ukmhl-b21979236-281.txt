From one border of the foot to the other a curved incision is carried along the anterior furrow on the sole of the foot, and the semilunar skin flap is reflected to the spot, where the amputation is required. 2. A smaller semilunar flap is formed upon the dorsum of the foot, the ends of which meet those of the plantar flap at the inner and outer borders of the foot. Instead of the dorsal flap the operation may be completed by a circular incision, if there is sufficient skin from the sole of the foot to cover the ends of the bones. 3. At the bases of both flaps the soft parts are carefully divided with a narrow knife upon and between the separate metatarsal bones. 4. By means of narrow strips of carbolised gauze or linen, which are drawn through between the separate bones with a pair of forceps, the soft parts are forcibly retracted, and all the bones sawn through (fig. 363 and 364).

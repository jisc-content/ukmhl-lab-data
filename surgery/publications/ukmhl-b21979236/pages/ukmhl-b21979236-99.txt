79 f. In fracture of the clavicle, the displacement of the fragments can be easily, if not permanently reduced, by a. Desaults bandage for fractured clavicle. It has indeed gone out of fashion, but it is an excellent exercise, in which the individual turns are employed for all shoulder dressings. The first bandage fixes a wedge-shaped cushion in the axilla of the abducted arm by turns, which pass round the chest (fig. 167). After the arm has been lowered and pressed against the cushion, it is fixed by a second bandage to the chest, and at the same time forced backwards (fig. 168). â€¢ The third bandage supports the arm in the manner of a sling (fig- 169). To prevent the turns of the bandage from slipping, they can be smeared with starch, or sewn together in several places with a needle and thread. p. Szymanowsky's handkerchief bandages for fractured clavicle are very effectual (fig. 170. a, b). Fig. 170. a b SZYMANOWSKY'S handkerchief bandages for fractured clavicle. a. From behind. b.

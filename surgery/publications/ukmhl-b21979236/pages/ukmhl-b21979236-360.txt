280 (fig. 498) are most conveniently used, if the outer opening is big enough to push one blade of the forceps beneath the bone. Although only a Fig. 498. HOFFMANN'S gouge-forceps. small piece is ever removed at a time with these instruments from the edge of the fracture, yet the opening can be quickly enlarged in every direction. 4. If there is not a large opening in the skull, but only a narrow fissure, which has to be widened, the gouge is used; the best instru- ments for this purpose are the common carpenter's chisel, and a wooden mallet, with which small sharp blows are dealt upon the chisel obliquely placed upon the bone (fig. 499). If the opening has been carefully widened, in this manner, so that the gouge-forceps can be employed, the opening is enlarged with this instrument in the manner previously described. 5. As soon as the object, which is compressing or penetrates the dura mater, is sufficiently exposed, it is raised with the elevator, seized with dressing- or vulsellum- forceps, and carefully extracted. If it clings firmly to the dura mater, it must not be torn out by force, but loosened by notching the membrane. 6. If a metal point, firmly wedged into the skull and broken off on a level with the surface, has to be extracted, it can be made ac- cessible on both sides by small cuts with a gouge (fig. 499), and then seized by a strong pair of forceps, or better by a small vice, such as watch-makers use.

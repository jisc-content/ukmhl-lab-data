carpal bone of the index finger and the trapezium, which communi- cates with the remaining carpal joints, is in no danger of being opened. 5. The division of the ligaments on the radial side of the joint (fig. 338) completes the operation, which leaves a linear cicatrix (fig. 339). Fig. 338. Fig. 339. p. By lateral flaps (Walther's). 1. The thumb being abducted, the knife is placed upon the middle of the web, and carried upwards with a sawing motion between the first and second metacarpal bones, till it strikes upon the ulnar border of the base of the first metacarpal bone (fig. 340). Fig. 340. 2. The point of the knife is cautiously inserted under the base of the 1st metacarpal bone, and the carpo-metacarpal joint thus opened. Care however is taken to avoid the joint between the trapezium and the 2ml metacarpal bone.

304 Pig. 532. Fig. 533 Improvised reflector. Q. BED-LIFTS. 1. Ill stationary well-organised hospitals, special means, often com- plicated and expensive, are kept for raising the patient. They are used, when the patient is severely wounded, for changing and renewing the dressing or the bed-linen, for cleaning the back, for washing, and pro- tecting against a bed sore, and to facilitate defecation without causing the patient much pain, and without injuring the shattered limbs by movements. 2. In war they have often to be quickly improvised, and that with little means at hand. 3. Besides the stretcher for raising, which is represented on page 27G (fig. 496), Volkmann's bed-lift is to be especially recommended for its simplicity and usefulness (fig. 534).

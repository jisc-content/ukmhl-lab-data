259 with forceps and blunt- pointed (fig. 469) or probe-pointed (fig. 470) bistoury. Fig. 469. Blunt-pointed bistoury. Fig. 470. Probe-pointed bistoury for excision. 11. After the haemorrhage has been arrested, a stout drainage tube is placed in the glenoid cavity, and the lower end brought out through an opening, which is made in the skin (if there be no gun-shot wound there) behind the wound (on the inner side of the latissimus dorsi). 12. The wound is then closed with sutures, the arm placed in a sling and supported by a Stromever-s cushion (fig. 164, page 77). 13. As soon as the healing process commences and the fever has disappeared, the patient may be allowed to walk about and resume a little movement of his hand and elbow. 14. After this method of operating, a loose joint is generally formed, with displacement of the end of the humerus towards the thorax, or a feeble articulation with the coracoid process. A free active movement is produced much sooner, if the connections of all the muscles, surrounding the joint, with the capsular ligament and the periosteum of the shaft are retained. This is the aim of the following method. VIII, THE SUBPERIOSTEAL OR SUBSCAPULAR EXCISION OF THE SHOULDER. Langenbeck. 1.â€”4. as in the preceding operation. 5. The periosteum is divided with the bone knife along the inner border of the bicipital groove, and carefully raised with a narrow elevator from the lesser tuberosity. 17*

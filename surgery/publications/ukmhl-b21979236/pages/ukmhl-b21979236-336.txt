256 4. The head of the radius is exposed and removed with the key- hole saw. 5. The insertion of the capsular ligament is liberated in front and behind, first from the border of the capitellum, then from the trochlea. 6. By adduction of the forearm the humerus is forced out of the wound; by this movement the ulnar nerve slips away from its posterior aspect. 7. The articular surface of the humerus is removed with the saw. 8. The olecranon is exposed and sawn off. VII. EXCISION OF THE SHOULDER. With Langekbeck-s anterior vortical incision (older method). Fig. 462. Excision of the shoulder. With LANfl EN BECK'S anterior vertical incision. 1. The patient lies upon his back, with the shoulder raised upon a pillow; the arm is held, so that the external condyle of the humerus is directed forwards. 2. An incision, beginning at the anterior border of the acromion, quite close to its arti- culation with the clavicle, and running for 6â€”10cm vertically downwards, divides the deltoid muscle and reaches the capsule of the joint and the periosteum . (fig. 462). 3. The muscle is retracted on both sides of the incision: the tendon of the long head of the biceps is seen lying within its sheath (fig. 463). 4. An incision along the outer side of the tendon opens its sheath; the knife is directed up- wards with the back of the blade in the bicipital groove, and divides

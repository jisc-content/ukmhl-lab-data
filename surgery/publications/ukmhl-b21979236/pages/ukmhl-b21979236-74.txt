54 For gunshot fractures of the maxillary bones, the buccal cavity must be diligently washed out with the irrigator. The displaced frag- ments are best reduced by dental splints of vulcanized india-rubber, which must be made by a skilful dentist. 0. DRESSINGS FOR THE NECK. To fasten dressings on the neck, it is best to make use of: 1. The simple necker- chief (fig. 105), a trian- gular handkerchief folded like a cravat. 2. For transverse â€¢wounds of the neck, by introducing a piece of stiff paste-board into the neckerchief, the head can be pressed towards the injured side (fig. 106). P. DRESSINGS FOR THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 1. BANDAGING of the whole arm (fig. 107) is commenced, by bandaging every finger and the entire hand with a narrow roller (gauntlet, chirotheka a, i), (s. also fig. 33). The forearm is then bandaged by an ascending spiral with reverses (c), the elbow by a figure of eight (Testudo, cZ), the arm by a simple spiral (<?) and the shoulder by the spica (/). 2. HANDKERCHIEF BANDAGES. a. Figure-of-eight for the hand (fig. 108). b. Covering the whole hand (fig. 109, left hand). c. Handkerchief for the elbow (fig. 109, right elbow).

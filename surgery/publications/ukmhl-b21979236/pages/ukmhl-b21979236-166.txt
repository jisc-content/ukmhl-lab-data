Fig. 282. Introduction of the probe. X. By means of the probe the artery is raised sufficiently high to allow a narrow aneurism needle (Cooper's or Syme-s), with an eye at the point, to be passed beneath in the opposite direction (fig. 283 and 284). Fig. 284. Fig. 283. Introduction of the aneurism needle. [j.. The probe is removed; through the eye of the needle a strong ligature (of silk or carbolised catgut) is threaded and the needle withdrawn; the middle of the liga- ture remains lying beneath the artery. v. The ends of the ligature are tied together round the artery icith a reef-knot (fig. 22) [not with a granny (fig. 23)] and without pulling on the artery; the knot SYME'S aneurism needle.

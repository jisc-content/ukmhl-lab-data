Fig. 348. Disarticulation of the hand with two skin flaps (RUYSCH). 2. The skin flap is liberated from the extended tendons, reflected up- wards, and the joint opened, as in the circular incision. 3. The bundle of flexor tendons arc pushed forward from the an- terior surface of the wrist by the tip of the left index finger in the wound, and carefully divided by a to-and-fro movement of the knife. A small skin flap is then formed in the palm of the hand by cutting out from the wound (fig. 349). NB. It is convenient to mark out the palmar flap at the commencement of the operation by a cutaneous incision. y. Amputation by the radial flap (Dubkueil). 1. A semilunar flap is cut from the skin, which covers the meta- carpal bone of the thumb. Its base embraces the radial third of the carpus, and its point reaches the base of the first phalanx.

206 Fig. 360. Disarticulation of all the toes (plantar incision'. Fig. 361. 2. The toes are forcibly flexed, and a similar incision, the ends of which meet with those of the first, is made upon the dorsum along the bases of the toes (fig. 361). Both incisions penetrate between the toes to the middle of the web. 3. Both the semilunar flaps arc dissected back as far as the heads of the metatarsal bones. 4. Each toe is then separately removed; the sesamoid bones on the head of the first metatarsal bone are left behind. 5. If there is not sufficient shin, to cover easily the projecting heads of the metatarsal bones, they can bo separately removed with the metacarpal saw. 6. Fig. 362 shews the' appearance of the stump.

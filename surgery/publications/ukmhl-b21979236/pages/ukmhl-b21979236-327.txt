24? them to the metacarpal bones, communicate with one another (fig. 451). In such a case the following operation is performed. III. COMPLETE EXCISION OF THE WRIST. With Langenbeck s dorso-radial incision. 1. The operator sits at a small table, upon which the hand is placed slightly adducted and with the dorsum uppermost. An assistant sits opposite to him. 2. A cutaneous incision, beginning at the centre of the ulnar border of the metacarpal bone of the index finger is carried upwards for 9cm to the middle of the dorsal surface of the radial epiphysis (fig. 452). Fig. 452. LANGENBECK'S excision of the wrist. 3. The incision is carried deeply on the radial side of the extensor indicis and without injurying its sheath, passing upwards to the ulnar border of the extensor carpi radialis brevior (just at its insertion into the base of the third metacarpal bone). Here it divides the ligamentiun carpi dorsalis (posterior annular ligament) between the tendons of the extensor pollicis longus (secundi internodii pollicis) and the extensor indicis as far as the epiphyseal border of the radius (fig. 453). 4. While an assistant draws the soft parts asunder with fine retractors, the capsule is divided longitudinally, and together with the other ligaments separated in the following manner from the bones.

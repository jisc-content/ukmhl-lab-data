I. THE DRESSING OF WOUNDS. (BANDAGES AND SPLINTS.) A. COMMON RULES FOR THE TREATMENT OF WOUNDS AND INJURIES. 1. The first and most important principle in the treatment of wounds is to keep at a distance all injurious influences, which can hinder or retard their healing. Therefore every method of treatment should be rejected which introduces new noxious influences. 2. Rest is the most important condition for rapid healing. The injured part must be therefore placed at rest (immobilized made immoveable), and absolute rest in bed must be observed in all severe injuries, at any rate at the commencement. Every unnecessary disturbance (touching, examination, probing, squeezing etc.) of a wound is to be avoided. 3. Venous stasis hinders the healing. By elevating the limb care is taken, that the escape of venous blood and lymph from the injured part is not impeded; and the removal of any strangulation (such as constricting clothes or bandages) must never be omitted. 4. The retention of the secretions of the wound tends to suppu- ration, to traumatic fever, and to other accidental complications. A free escape for the secretions of the wound is therefore always to be considered as one of the most important principles in the treat- ment of wounds. Drainage tube. There should be no hermetical sealing of wounds, but an escape must be provided for the secretions, by introducing perforated india- rubber tubes (CiiAssAiGNACs Drainage tubes) (fig. 1) as deeply as possible, ICamarch, tlie Surgeon's Handbook. -Â«

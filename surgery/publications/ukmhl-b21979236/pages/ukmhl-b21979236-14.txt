June 1878. II. H. CLUTTON. TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. The following translation lias been made at the request of the author. As strict an adherence to the original, as the technicalities of the English language would allow, has been throughout preserved. The author's preface fully explains the reasons for the short and terse style in which the book is written. This brevity has increased the difficulties of the trans- lation and will it is hoped serve as an apology for its many deficiencies. St. Thomas' Hospital.

U5 fatty degeneration of the heart cannot be made out with accuracy in many cases. 13. As soon as an accident of this kind takes place the chloro- form apparatus must be at once removed, and an attempt made to restore the halting respiration and heart's action. 14. In asphyxia the mouth should be at once opened, and the lower jaw raised with both hands, the index ringers of each being applied behind the ascending ramus, so that the lower range of teeth projects beyond the upper (partial dislocation) (fig. 242). By this Fig. 242. Pushing forward the lower jaw for threatening asphyxia in chloroform narcosis manoeuvre, the hyoid bone, the root of the tongue, and the epiglottis are drawn forwards, and the entrance to the larynx rendered free. 15. If muscular contractions prevent this from being accomplished, the teeth should be separated by a dilator, and the tip of the tongue seized with the fingers, or with the tongue forceps (fig. 243), and pulled forwards as far as possible out of the mouth. 16. If the respiration nevertheless continues difficult and is accom- panied with coarse rales, it may depend upon blood or mucus in the glottis. This should be removed with a sponge, passed by vulsellum forceps to the larynx. 8*

22: p. Disarticulation at the knee by the flap operation. 1. The leg is raised, and a semilunar flap 8cm in length is formed from tho upper part of the calf by a curved incision, beginning 10,11 below the middle of the lateral border of one condyle and terminating 1cm below the middle of the other condyle: this is liberated from tho fascia as far as its base. Fig. 414. 2. The leg is then brought down, and with the knee flexed a larger skin flap, 10â€”12rm in length, is cut from the same points upon the anterior surface: this is liberated as far as the lower border of the patella, and turned upwards (fig. 414). 3. The disarticulation is effected in the same manner as in the circular method. Fig. 415 shews the ap- pearance of the stump. Fig. 415. Disarticulation at the knee with two Haps.

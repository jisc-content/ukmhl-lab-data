and buckles (fig. 220). \02 If the leg were now left without any further support, it would sink into the mattress, and by the friction, the action of the weight would be entirely or partially destroyed. Moreover owing to the foot swinging from side to side, the fragments of the bone suffer rotation. In order that both may be avoided, the leg should be placed on VolkmaniN's sliding apparatus (fig. 219), viz, a short iron concave splint Fig. 219. VOLKMANN'S sliding apparatus (sliding foot piece). provided with an aperture for the heel, to which a foot-piece is fastened: a narrow cross lath is fixed to its under surface, which rests and slides upon two polished triangular pieces of wood. In default of this, a prism-shaped piece of wood can be fastened transversely to the posterior aspect of the leg by means of a plaster of Paris bandage, which is carried round the foot ; and this is made to slide upon two similar pieces of wood, Avhich are united in a parallel direction to one another by iron wires (fig. 218). Counter-extension is provided for, by a padded strap (perinaeal band) carried over the perinaeum, or by thick india-rubber tubing, which is fastened to the head of the bed by a hook; or the weight of the body is used as counter-extension, by raising the lower end of the bed, and placing beneath it wooden blocks or bricks. To prevent the lateral movement of the fractured ends of the bone, the thigh is inclosed with short splints, e. g., with Bell's (fig. 46) or with Gooch's flexible splints, which are fastened together by straps

HZ Plate VI. Ligature of the subclavian artery in the left supra-clavicular fossa. (The artery comes forward behind the scalenus anticus, and runs over the first rib downwards and outwards behind the clavicle.) 1. The arm is drawn downwards, the head turned towards the opposite side, and a pillow placed beneath the back. 2. The cutaneous incision is 6â€”8cm long, semilunar, and carried obliquely over the supra-clavicular fossa from the outer border of the sterno-mastoid muscle to the outer third of the clavicle. 3. The platysma is divided, and the border of the sterno-mastoid muscle exposed; the external jugular vein must not be injured! 4. The superficial layer of the cervical fascia, and the adipose tissue in the supra-clavicular fossa are divided. 5. The omo-hyoid muscle is detached and drawn upwards. 6. Through the fat and cellular tissue (with veins!), to the scalenus anticus, whose tendon can be felt close to the tubercle of the first rib. 7. The inner border of the brachial plexus appears, which is drawn upwards and outwards. 8. Between the scalenus anticus and the brachial plexus, but somewhat deeper than the latter, lies the artery; it can be seen after dividing the deep layer of the cervical fascia. 9. The subclavian vein lies in front and below the tendon of the scalenus anticus, and close behind the clavicle. NB. Injury of the external jugular vein (at the outer border of the sterno- mastoid), of the supra-scapular artery (near the clavicle), of the trans- versalis colli artery (upon the brachial plexus), and the phrenic nerve (running downwards upon the scalenus anticus) must be avoided. 10*

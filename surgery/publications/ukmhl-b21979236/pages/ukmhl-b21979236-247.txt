Fig. 311. Amputation by muscular flaps. LANGENBECK'S method. Nor is the latter method of amputation so satisfactory for gun- shot fractures, because the knife is likely to be arrested by projectiles hidden in the soft parts, or by splinters of bone. A double edged knife is inconvenient, because, if great care be not taken, the vessel may be injured at many places in the flap by the sharp back. In addition to this, the double edged knife is much more difficult to sharpen than the single edged knife. Moreover, with the latter the flaps can be made just as well from within outwards, especially if the point is set like the longest knife in fig. 298. The oval incision (Langenbeck) is a modification of the flap ampu- tation. In it the two flaps are united at the back by a transverse in- cision, so that the wound has the appearance of an ace of hearts. It is especially well fitted for disarticulation of the smaller joints (e. g. disarticulation of the fingers and toes). For larger joints it has no advantage over other methods, except the rapidity of execution, which is not of so much importance since the employment of chloroform and the bloodless method of operating. To be correctly executed it requires a large experience and a very sharp knife, which is not always to be had on the battle field.

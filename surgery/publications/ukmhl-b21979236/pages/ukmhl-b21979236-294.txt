The tendo Achil- lis is divided imme- diately above its in- sertion, and the skin perforated at the same spot to allow the pas- sage of a drainage tube. 6. Fig. 397 shews the appearance of the stump. I. * Gunther's modification of Pirogoff's operation. 1. The incision begins and ends immediately in front of the malleoli, aud passes across the sole of the foot at the posterior border of the scaphoid (fig. 398 â€” 400). 2. The dorsal incision forms a small semilunar nap, which reaches as far as the scaphoid (fig. 401). 3. After the joint has been opened, the soft parts are dissected obliquely backwards on both sides of the os calcis as far as the insertion of the tendo Achillis, in doing which any injury of the posterior tibial artery must be carefully avoided. 4. Immediately in front of the insertion of the tendo Achillis a key-hole saw is placed upon the os calcis and the bone obliquely divided from behind forwards and downwards. 5. In the same way the tibia and fibula are obliquely sawn through from behind forwards and downwards (fig. 402). * See Gontiier's Leitfadcn zu den Operationen am menschlichen Korpcr. Part 1, page 137.

41 3. THE GUTTAPERCHA BANDAGE. Splints are cut out of guttapercha 2 —3min thick, and dipped in hot water, at 60° K, till they become quite flexible; they are then applied to the limb, which has been previously enveloped with a wet flannel roller, and firmly bound on with gauze bandages. By pouring cold water over them, they quickly become hard. 4. THE PLASTER OF PARIS BANDAGE was invented by Mathvsen in 1852.' It has this advantage over all others, that it becomes hard and firm in the shortest time. 1. Mixing the plaster of Paris is best done in a porcelain dish, about so much water being poured upon a sufficient quantity of plaster, whilst constantly stirring, as to reduce the paste to the consistence of thick cream. It stiffens in 5 —10 minutes to a solid mass. 2. Should it be desirable to delay the setting of the plaster, more water is added, or some starch, size, milk, beer, or borax is mixed with the water. 3. If the setting is to be hastened, less water, or hot water is used; or some common salt, alum, silica, or cement powder is added to it. 4. If the plaster has deteriorated by the absorption of water from the atmosphere,, it can be again made serviceable, by heating it in an open pan, till it no longer gives off steam. 5. The application of the plaster of Paris bandage can be carried out in various ways. 6. Strips of bandages are dipped in the plaster-cream, and placed after Scultet's method (many tailed) round the limb, which has been previously smeared with oil or lard (fig. 72) (Adelmann). 7. Old clothes (woollen stockings, drawers, vests etc. or coarse sack- cloth) can be cut up, and used instead of bandages, as they readily absorb the plaster-cream (fig. 73) (Pikogoff).

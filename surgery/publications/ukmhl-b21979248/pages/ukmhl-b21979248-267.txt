243 WATER. 6 P.M., the bottom of the pit should be covered with a 3-inch layer of dry- earth. The wood ashes from the cooking-places should be spread about in the vicinity. Lime, if it is to be had, should be used in large quantities. The health and comfort of every one in hospital depends very much upon the manner in which these duties are conducted. Pure water being so essential, the following instructions may be given here :—" When the halting-ground is reached, it may be necessary to filter the water. A common \Aa,n is to carry a cask, charred inside, and pierced with small holes at the bottom; it is sunk in a small stream, and the water rises through the holes. A better plan still is to have two casks, one inside the other ; the outer pierced with holes at the bottom, and the inner near the top ; the space between is filled with sand, gravel, or char- coal if procurable ; the water rises through the gravel between the barrels, and flows into the inner barrel (fig. 128). It is advisable to heat sand or gravel to redness before use ; the same applies to charcoal if there be any question of its pui-ity. All these media must be changed fre- quently. " Medical offi cers should make arrangements for the different places of supply. Men and cattle should be watered at different points ; places should be assigned for washing; and, if removal of excreta by M^ater be attempted, the excreta sliould flow in far below any possible spring. In case of a spring, several reservoirs of wood should be made, and the°water allowed to flow from one to another—the highest for men, the second for cattle. If It is a running stream, localities should be fixed for the special purpose; that for the men's drinking-water should be highest up the WATER. Fig. 12S.

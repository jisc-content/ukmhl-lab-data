It will be best to begin 1 inch to the outer side of the middle of Foupart s hgament and an inch above its level, and to prolong it to a point an inch above the anterior-superior ihac spine. The first incision should expose the tendon of the external oblique ; if the super- ficial epigastric artery is cut, it should be tied at once. The tendon is then to be divided to the same extent, the blade of the knife bein<^ held with_ its edge perpendicular to the surface in the whole len^^th of the incision, and the muscular fibres of the internal oblique will be exposed Ihese are to be divided m the same way, the original curve of the incision being carefully preserved, until the transversahs is exposed. The mus- cular fibres of the transversahs are then to be divided in the original curve and by the same method, or a portion of muscle may be taken up with forceps, and divided, until the fascia transversalis is brought into view when a director may be slipped beneath the remainder of the muscle, and the knife run along it. The fascia transversalis, which will now be exposed in the whole length of the incision, will be found to vary much in the quantity of fat it contains, being sometimes thin and transparent, and at others thick and weU developed. It is to be picked up with forceps and carefully opened with the blade held horizontally, and the director being inserted, it is to be divided. The outside of the peritoneum will now be exposed. It is of a bluish appearance, and the bowels can be indistinctly seen through it. The operator with his forefinger carefully strips up the peritoneum from the iliac fossa towards the median line as far as the inner border of the psoas. The external iliac artery and vein will be found lying parallel to the inner border of the psoas in a distinct sheath of fascia, which must be opened with knife and forceps in order to expose the artery. The vein lies to the inner side of the artery, and the genito-crural nerve to its outer side; the needle should be passed from within outwards. If the incision is too near the middle line, there will be a risk of opening up the external abdominal ring or the sheath of the rectus, and of dividing the epigastric artery. If the incision is too low, it wiD interfere with the inguinal canal and spermatic cord in front; and behind, the trunk of the circumflexa ilii running between the internal oblique and transversalis will be divided. The curve and length of the incision must be carefully preserved, or it will be difficult to reach the artery, and each muscle should be finished before the deeper one is inter- fered with. In using the director, great care must be taken not to force it through deeper structures unawares, but, by moving it horizontally, to make it clear its way at the intended level.

These sores generally appear on the sacrum, the trochanters, elbows, shoulders, heels, and back of the head. The surgeon should ever be on the watch for them, as, in very weak subjects, they give but little warning of their approach or presence. When there is a probability of long confinement, and the case is likely to be attended with constant decubitus, every precaution should be adopted, such as keeping the parts dry, the bedclothes smooth, and pillows arranged from time to time so as to prevent pressure on any particular spot. Water and air beds may be used with great advantage, but in warm climates they are heating. The skin may be hardened by the application of brandy, rectified spirits, solution of alum, tannin, tincture of iodine, collodion, or of bi- chloride of mercury composed of 2 grains to 1 ounce of spirits of wine. When bed sores do occur, removal of pressure must be carried out by some means, which, on service in the field, requires ingenuity, as the usual mechanical contrivances found in permanent hospitals may not be present, A sling for the more convenient treatment of bed sores was designed

EXCISION. 191 joint, keeping the knife close to the end of the fibula; then with the large bone scissors, or nippers, cut through the fibula from one- half to three-quarters of an inch above its junction with the tibia, and, after dividing the ligamentous fibres connecting the two bones, remove the malleolus externus. Turn the leg on to its outer side, and cut through the internal lateral ligament close to the tibia, to avoid wounding the posterior tibial artery ; this will allow the foot to be dis- located outwards, and the lower end of the tibia to be brought weU out through the wound. An assistant keeping the foot and tendons out of the way, the lower end of the tibia is to be removed with a fine saw to the same extent as the fibula, or as high as the injury or disease Fig. ny. requires. The articulating surface, or injured part of the astragalus, is then to be removed, after which the foot is to be returned to its proper position, and the cut surfaces of the tibia and astragalus brought into close approximation, and so kept by suture, strapping, and bandage. The limb is to be placed on an outside leg splint, having a foot-piece to it." Professor Esraarch has designed a splint for the after-treatment of excision or resection of the ankle-joint; he found the great utility of such

On the other hand, Dr. J. A. M'WiUiam reports.* as the results of his research, that during chloroform anaesthesia the blood-pressure is lowered and the heart s action is weakened. Dilatation of the heart occurs to an appreciable extent, even when chloroform is administered gentlv and mixed with abundance of air. There is no distinct change in the rate of the heart s action when dilatation occurs. A sudden and complete cessation of the cardiac rhythm is never caused by the inhalation of chloroiorm Cardiac failure occurs by a more or less sudden enfeeblement and dilatation of the organ; not by a complete cessation of rhythm Oardiac failure sometimes occurs in this way a considerable time before the respiration stops, though generally the respiration stops before the heart has become mcapacitated. Changes in the respiration assert a raost important influence upon the effects of chloroform administration An amount of chloroform which can be given with safety durino- easy breathing may speedily become dangerous during deep rapid respiration. ree dilution of air gives no security against an overdose. A percentage that gives safe anesthesia during ordinary breathing may lead to fatal collapse if given during exaggerated respiration. The experiments also prove that the difference between the action of chloroform and ether is not simply a difference of intensity. There is commonly seen a very striking and important difference between the relative influence of the two anaesthetics upon certain functions. Ether can abolish the conjunctival reflex, and induce profound anesthesia with no appreciable direct effect on the heart; while chloroform, in causing a less deep anaesthesia, in which the conjunctival reflex is not abolished, may directly cause marked dilatation of the heart. Several fatal cases of chloroform-poisoning have occurred of late, and in each of them it has seemed that the heart suddenly gave way, and ceased without giving any previous warning ; and in several of these cases the heart was proved to be fattj'. It is difficult to see how this sort of accident can be altogether avoided, as there is no way of detecting that a heart is thus affected. But it seems to point to the rule of administering ether, unless the nature of the operation about to be undertaken forbids the use of an inhaler, or if there is considerable bronchial irritation present, when ether would be contra-indicated on account of the distress it would occasion. Whoever in the present day undertakes to administer chloroform, should give his imdivided attention to the patient, and must * " Eeport on an Experimental Investigation of the Action of Chloroform and Ether," by Dr. J.

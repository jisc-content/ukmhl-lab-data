175 AMPUTATION. upper euds of the internal incision to a point exactly opposite to the outer side, which will be about an inch below the upper end of the outer incision, the instrument being carried in a line slightly convex down- wards, so as to form a very short posterior flap. The anterior flap is then raised in the manner above mentioned, including everything in front of the bones and interosseous membrane, after which the tibia and fibula are cleared as high as the level of the upper end of the outer in- cision, the finger tip being still used in detecting the parts anterior to the interosseous membrane. In order to avoid splintering the fibula it is best to saw both bones at the same time, and to finish the fibula before the tibia. The sharp angle of the spine of the tibia should be removed. " In amputating through the calf on the same principle, the operation is similar, except that owing to the redundancy of muscle in the posterior flap in a largely developed calf, when the posterior flap is apt to drag down the skin of the front of the leg on the sharp edge of the tibia and induce ulceration, the anterior flap need not be longer than_ two-thirds of the diameter of the limb ; but to compensate for its diminution the posterior flap must be made at least half as long as the anterior by carrying the knife round the back of the limb at an angle of forty-five degrees through the integuments, and dissecting them up to the level of the upper end of the inner part of the incision before cutting towards the bones, so as to get rid of the heavy and contractile mass of the sural muscle. " When there is not enough sound tegument to admit of the long anterior flap, the modified circular of Mr. Syme proves highly valuable. Fig. 104. It is done thus. The skin and fat are di\'ided by two crescentic incisions with the convexity downwards so as to form short antero-posterior flaps of the integument, which is then dissected up considerably higher than

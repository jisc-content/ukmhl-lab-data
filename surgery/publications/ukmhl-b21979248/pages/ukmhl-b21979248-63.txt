39 SPLINTS. SPLINTS, It has always been a special point in preparing surgical appliances for war to provide splints of materials which wiU be sufHciently strong to support the largest bones when fractured or shattered, and at the same time be light, easily carried, and capable of being applied with facility. The old-fashioned wooden scored splints were at one time much used, but they were liable to be rendered imserviceable by exposure to wet or from the moisture of wounds, and have consequently fallen into dis- favour ; they were, however, in the opinion of S. M. Porter, the most valuable and useful splints which a surgeon could take into the field with him, being light and easily adapted to aU regions. Fig. 46. Wire or Trough Splints.—The French have introduced splints made of wire, which are very strong but somewhat cumbersome; they are formed to the shape of the limbs for which they are intended, those for large limbs being composed of a stronger description of wire than those for smaller, and having the general appearance of splint represented in fig. 46, which is intended for the leg. Duncan Splint.—Duncan has designed a splint kno%\Ti as the '^rattan splint:" it is composed of cane or small ratan, strung as it were together and cut to certain lengths ; each end is covered ^vith a cap of cloth to prevent splitting or the rough ends irritating. They are very light, but rather bulky, presenting the appearance, without caps, as shown in fig. 47. A modification of this splint has been made by covering the cane \\dth canvas and attaching three straps and buckles, or as many as may be considered necessary for the size of the splint; this makes the splint more bulky than Duncan's. Iron-Wire Gauze Splints (fig. 48), familiar to all surgeons form most convenient appliances, but they are heavy, and apt to rust when exposed to moisture. Thin sheets of perforated zinc or tin, guttapercha, leather, cane, whalebone, felt, and various other materials, have been proposed, so

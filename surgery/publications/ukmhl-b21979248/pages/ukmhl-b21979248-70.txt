This fiescription of bandage dries quickly. • Tc^ ^^^^ applying the plaster apparatus, as practised m the Bavarian Army during the late Franco-German war, IS as follows:-''Two pieces of flannel, 20 inches broad, are stretched together for the leg, as represented in fig. 58, and stitched down the middle; and beyond this both are cut through in the same line for the length of the foot. The flannel IS placed under the limb, so that the seam reaches from the ham to the heel. The sides of the inner piece are brought together over the leg, and fixed in front and along the sole by pins (bent at right angles (fig. 59), so that they may be easily extracted afterwards), and thus a closely- T, u J^r ™^ stoclang is formed. The sides of the outer piece are then brought forward and cut, so that each may overlap the middle line of the leg a,nd sole by three-quarters of an inch. The limb is then laid on one side and, while this outer piece of flannel is held back, a layer ot plaster of Paris of the consistence of thick cream is spread evenly to the thickness of half an inch over the inner piece, and made to pass quite to the seam behind and the line of juncture of the sides of the inner piece m tront. i he outer piece is pressed over this before it sets, and should just reach the middle Kne in front and along the sole. When this has ' rn\ m^,^^ turned over, and the process is repeated on the other side (hg. bU). ihe pins may now be removed. The seam serves as a hinge, Fig. 59. Fig. 60. and when the whole has set the splint may be taken off, the edges of the plaster trimmed, and those of the inner piece of flannel cut so as to leave sufficient to turn over and stitch down on the outer piece.

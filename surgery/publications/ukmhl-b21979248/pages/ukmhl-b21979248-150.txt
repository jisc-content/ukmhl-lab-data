Therefore, with a compound fracture of the femur in_ the middle or lower third, and with the certainty of contmua unavoidable moves, experience says that amputation is the man s only chance of life. Guthrie, referring to the result of treatment of forty-three selected tractures of the thigh, which were attempted to be saved under his own direction at the battle of Toulouse, reports that of this number thirteen mec ; twelve were amputated at the secondary period, of whom seven died ; and eighteen retained their limbs. But he considers the result most unsatisfactory, notwithstanding the care and attention bestowed upon them. Nearly all the wounded, after this battle, had every possible assistance and comfort from the second day after the action. The hospitals were well supplied with bedsteads, no inconsiderable point m the treatment of fractures. Every broken thigh or leg ^vas in the straight position, and the success was gi-eater than on any previous occasion JNTe^,gj.(.i^g2ggg^ ^j^j^ ^^^^^^ advantages, there can be Httle doubt that, if amputation had been performed in the first instance on the thirty-six out of forty-three who died or partially recovered, some twenty ^yould have survived, able, for the most part, to support them- selves with a moderate pension, instead of there being perhaps five, or at most ten, nearly unable to do anything for themselves." The least dangerous and most likely to be saved, he considers, are fractures of the lower third, or at most of the lower half, of the thigh bone; and when

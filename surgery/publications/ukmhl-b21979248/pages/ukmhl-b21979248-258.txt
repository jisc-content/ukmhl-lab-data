The further the prolongation of the disease, the better are the prospects of recovery 1 he disease is^ generally ushered in by a disturbed state of the digestive organs, with a feeling of malaise, a sense- of weakness, and general de- pression ; stillness or soreness about the jaw, face, and neck : inability to swallow food or drink. As the disease advances, there is pain in the pit of the stomach, spasms of the voluntary muscles, the countenance assumes an aged and agonised expression, the angles of the mouth bein^^ drawn up (risus mrdo}iicus). Cramps and pains wiU attack the muscles ot the legs ; difficulty of breathing will set in M'ith a loud sobbing from spasms of the diaphragm. The skin will be hot, the pulse quick, and the perspiration profuse with a pungent odour. The mind in all probability will remain clear, but the sleeplessness will cause much distress. The muscles of the trunk become affected, the body being sometimes bent back forming an arch (opisthotono.s), or to one side; or the body may be straight stiff, and rigid, with the belly drawn in and chest expanded ; or the body may be arched forward (emprosthotonos). There may be constipation, but the sufferer will have perfect control of the bladder. Ihe voice will be weak from spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the chest and neck. The temperature generally becomes very high, particularly immediately before death, which occurs from exhaustion. The sufferer may have short intervals of relief, the spasm being again induced by a slight current of air passing over the body, by taking food or fluids, or by shifting his position or the bed-clothes.

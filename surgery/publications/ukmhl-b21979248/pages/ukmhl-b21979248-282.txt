After tlie drying (the gauze will still feel somewhat moist owing to the glycerine), the pieces of gauze (40 metres) should be folded up smooth and sub- mitted to a screwpress in order to obtain cubes of 11-5 centimetres (4 3-5"), and then they should be well tied up with string. 1 vi^^^^io^"!?®^ of pressed gauze should be wrapped in red packing-paper and labelled bublimate Uauze." The same wrapping up and labelling must be given to subhmate gauze even when prepared in the field. ^- Tbe above given formula for the antiseptic fluid may, in certai i cases be modifled according to directions from the surgeon. For use in the field ordinarv water may be substituted for distilled water. 8. Sublimate Cotton Wool for Wounds.—The, directions for preparing antiseptic cotton wool are the same as given in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 7, but the cotton wool takes up more fluid than an equal weight of gauze. 9. During the drying process attention has to be given to ensure the wool dries loose and not in a lump. * firieg's-Sanitaets-Ordnmig, Appendix V., § C3, dated 13th May, 1886.

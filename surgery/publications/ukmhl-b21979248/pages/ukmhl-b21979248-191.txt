Amputation of the Wrist (Flaps).â€”" A semi-lunar incision is made across the back of the wrist, its extremities being at the styloid processes, and its centre reaching down as far as the second row of carpal bones. This flap being dissected up, the joint opened behind, and the lateral ligaments cut through, the knife, being ijlaced between the carpus and bones of forearm, is made to cut out a iiap from the anterior surface of the palm (fig. 99).

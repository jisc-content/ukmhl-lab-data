In the intestinal form the stress falls upon the gastrrSS ST'tib^enlrSi^^^ ^^^^'-^^ . ''T^^' the charbon or malignant pustule, begins as a small red inflamed and itching spot which in twelve or fifteen hours vesiculates, the skin beneath the vesicle appearing as a dry brown or black slough In the course of the second day another crop of vehicles appears round the original seat of disease, the parts around become cedematous. In this stage of the disease there is little pain, the slou-h IS always dry and there is no pus, the sloughing spreads from the skin down to the subcutaneous tissue instead of as in carbuncle from the latter to the former.f In cases of charbon the constitutional symptoms may be slight or wanting. But when the general system is involved the symptoms may present great variety, but there is generally great mental depression and physical exhaustion, cold sweats, diarrhoea, followed by delirium and coma. In internal anthrax the symptoms may be general or accompanied by local afltections, usually pulmonary or gastro-intestinal, but they are generally such as we connect with extreme prostration, gi-eat mental depression and anxiety. The chief post-mortem lesions, are scattered haemorrhages m various organs; difltuse cellular exudations, congestion of lungs, and frequently a swollen and pulpy condition of the spleen. This disease in all its varieties is due to the presence of the anthrax bacillus in the connective tissue of some part of the body. Koch states that in animals and man the bacillus can enter the organism either *J)iclionarp of Medicine. t T/ie Practice of Surgery, Bryant.

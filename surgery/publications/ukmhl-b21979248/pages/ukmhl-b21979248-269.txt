In case of active operations in the field, a special scale will be fixed according to the climate and the circumstances of the expedition, but the following scale will, as far as possible, be adopted as a guide :— 1 lb. fresh, salt, or preserved meat. 1^ lb. bread, or 1 lb. biscuits or 1 lb. flour. ^ oz. tea. ^ oz. coffee. TfV oz. pepper. 5 lb. fresh vegetables, when procurable, or 1 oz. compressed vege- tables. gal. lime juice gill), ^ with ^ oz. sugar on days when I at the discretion of the G.O.C. on the fresh vegetables are not issued. \ recommendation of the M.O. ^ gal. rum (-i gill). J When the supply of cattle is abundant the ration of 1 lb. of fre.sh meat during active operations may be increased by the G.O.C. to 1| lbs.* Vinegar is of great value as an antiscorbutic, and its use should be encouraged. Condiments are also most important. Fat has about two and a-half times the potential energy of the carbo-hydrates, but will not replace them, hence the value of bacon in the above scale. Bacon was issued for the first time as a ration in the late expedition up the Nile (1884-85), when it was greatly appreciated. For a scale of rations used on that occasion, see Appendix IV. The late Professor de Chaumont wrote—" In cases of extreme fatigue, * Para. 20, Allowance Begulations, 1890.

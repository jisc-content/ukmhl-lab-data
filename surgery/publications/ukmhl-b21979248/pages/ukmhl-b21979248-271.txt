The hospital marquee covers 396 square feet, and contains 3,366 cubic feet. It can accommodate ten men without cots and eight men with cots comfortably. By regulation it is intended to hold eighteen sick. Parkes and de Chaumont give '6 per 1,000 volumes of carbonic acid in the air as the limit of impurity allowable—of this, '2 is derived from respiration, and the remainder is the normal quantity in the air. To maintain the air at this standard, an ordinary man who inspires and expires 30 cubic inches at every respiration sixteen times in a minute, requires to be supplied with 3,000 cubic feet of air per hour. In order to get this without draughts, sufficient cubic space and super- ficial area must be allowed for each patient, so that the air would main- tain this if changed three or four times in an hour. The surface area per tent for different densities of population per square mile is as follows :—

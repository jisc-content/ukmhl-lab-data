EXCISION. i86 lecommends the following operation :-" The joint is exposed on the dorsal surface by two lateral incisions of 2 inches in length, united bv a transverse line made below the projecting bone. The flaps, being raised Fig. 111. Fig. 11-2. the tendons are exposed, and should be separated from the radius by a knife passed underneath them in forcible extension of the hand back- wards. Along this line the fine blade of a metacarpal saw may be readily passed, which, being jointed at the point, can be fixed to its back after passing across the tendon. The blade of a knife passed half an inch under the radial artery will protect it from injury." Excision of the Hip-Joint.â€”This operation may be performed by incisions of such shapes as may suit the surgeon's convenience for removal of the damaged bone ; and in the event of the injury being from a gun- shot, there will be an open wound which may be extended. There are, however, certain methods laid down by different authorities. Professor C-ross prefers a semi-lunar flap of the gluteal muscles with the convexity downwards. This plan of incision, he considers, has the advantage, not only of allowing free access to the joint, but also of affording a ready outlet for the discharges. The superior extremity of the femur being thus exposed, is thrust out of the opening by carrjdng the limb across the sound one, rotating it inwards, and then pushing it up, when it is to be divided by means of a narrow saw. The great trochanter, however sound, should always be included in the operation, otherwise it will be sure to interfere more or less seriously with the healing process by pro- jecting into the wound.

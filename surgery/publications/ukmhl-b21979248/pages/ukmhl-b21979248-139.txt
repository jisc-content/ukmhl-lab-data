WOUNDS OF ORGANS OF MICTURITION. 115 pyaemia when the missile enters posteriorly and so traverses the thick gluteal muscles before fracturing the bone, the long shot tracks favouring septic inflammation and sloughing. Shot Fractures of the Ilium.—The frequency with which balls are embedded in the ilium is considerable, and most readily, of course, in the spongy parts of the bone. Ostitis followed by caries and necrosis with protracted suppurations are the results, and these injuries are also apt to be coin plicated by irritation of the branches of the sacral and sciatic nerves with consequent neuralgia, paralysis, or muscular atrophy. The bone may be largely and variously comminuted. Shot Fractures of the Pubis are more fatal than those of the ilium, and ownig to the toughness of this bone it is seldom much splintered by bullets ; caries is a less common result. The excess of mortality is due to a greater frequency of sloughing of the pelvic fascia, of injuries of vessels and nerves, and of urinary and fascal extravasation. Shot Fractures of the Ischium are less common and less fatal than analagous lesions of (he pubic bone; the bullet is sometimes found im- pacted. Pelvic cellulitis with deep suppurations are frequently the result of shot fractures of the ischium, and in some instances these mjuries are associated with injuries of the femur, or of the genital organs. The Sacrum is less liable to fracture from ordinary external violence than tue other bones of the pelvis, because of its thickness, its spongy texture, and situation, but these conditions afford no exemption from shot fractures. Fractures of this bone may be accompanied by injury to the rectum or bladder, and paralysis and other disorders referable to lesions of nerves are common. Experience shows the importance of removing detached fragments of bone after shot fracture of the pelvic bones, and of using energetic means for the removal of the balls. Bauden.s recommends tliat when a missile ijerforates the ilium and lodges under or ni the iliacus or psoas muscle, it is safer to seek it tHrough an incision similar to that made for ligation of the common iliac artery, rather than to enlarge the shot canal in the bone WOUiYDS OF ORGANS OF MICTURITION.

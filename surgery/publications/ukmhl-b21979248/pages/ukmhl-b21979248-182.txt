''^.^^^i^t^^^^^ f'^^ Disarticulation may be performed by the circular method, the oval method, or by flaps of different shapes, and by skin flaps with a circular cut through the muscles. ^ > j f Much discussion has taken place as to which is the best plan durinc- wariare. I he circular method was generally practised by the GermaS surgeons during the Franco-German War, and was attended by satis- lactory results. Esmarch prefers the circular incision, as the arteries are cut trans- versely, while by the flap operation an oval opening is made in the vessels and It might easily occur that the whole lumen of the vessel was not included in the ligature. The operations recommended for injuries when an army is moving are skin flaps and circular cut through the muscles. The advantages of these operations are—that the flaps are not so liable to be displaced in transport; there is less care required in the after-treatment, and it has been suggested by many authorities that the skin forms a better covering to the end of the bone than muscle, and is more in accordance with nature, none of those parts of the body where there is most pressure having other covering than the skin.

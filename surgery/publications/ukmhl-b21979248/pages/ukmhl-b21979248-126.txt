It the bladder is ruptured from direct violence within the peritoneum, and It is unrecognised, it is certain to cause death. Two cases of this accident have been reported by MacCormac* The symptoms were in both cases niuch alike, a history of a full bladder, the story of direct violence, inability to micturate, though there was the desire to do so. Latheterism failed to draw off urine beyond some blood-tinged drops In one case the catheter passed through the rent in the bladder and could be telt m the_abdomen Abdominal section was performed in each case and the rent in the bladder sewn by Lembert's method ; both recovered ireatment.—In the general treatment of these injuries, the first step should be to try and restore the sufferer from the shock and collapse by keeping him very quiet, applying warmth to the extremities, and placing him in a. comfortable position. Absolute rest should then be enforced the patient not being moved or allowed to move himself. Caution should be observed m the emploj^ment of restoratives and stimulants, in con- sequence of their hability to cause too much reaction and induce internal hajmorrhage. If, however, reaction does not set in, the surgeon M-ill have to consider the probability of there being a rupture of one or more of the viscera, and any symptoms of peritonitis would at once suggest this comphcation.

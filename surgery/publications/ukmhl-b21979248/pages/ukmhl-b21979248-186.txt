Amputation at tHe Shoulder-joint.-Hamilton of the U.S. Army re- commends the following proceeding :-The arm lying nearly against the side _ot the body, with a large bistoury or a small dissecting-knife an incision IS commenced at the middle point of the extremity of the acro- mion process, or two or three lines above this point (fig. 94), and carried perpendicularly downwards one inch and a half, the knife being made to cut deeply until it touches the head of the humerus. At this point the knife is carried obliquely, and rather abruptly, outwards and downwards to the centre of the lower margin of the axilla on the under side of the arm; in this second step of the incision, the tissues are divided down to the bone until the axillary margin is reached. From this point to the termination of the incision, only integuments are divided, so that we may avoid wounding the axillary artery. The knife is again introduced over the head of the humerus, at the point where the perijendicular incision became oblique, and it is carried down upon the inside of the arm in the same manner as we have described upon the outside. One assistant pulling asunder the lips of the wound upon the top of the shoulder, while a second carries the elbow slightly across the body, and rotates the head of the humerus outwards, so as to expose the capsule and the long head of the biceps, the surgeon divides them with his knife, and at the same moment the head of the humerus springs from its socket.

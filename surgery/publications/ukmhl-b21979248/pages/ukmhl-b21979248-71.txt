Volcer has devised a plan for applying a plaster of Pans bandage to a Fig. 61. fractured thigh, which is as follows -.—If time admits, give chloroform, and keep the patient under its influence till the plaster hardens. The patient should be kept perfectly steady. The extremities, from the toes to the haunch, must be enveloped in wadding, which is to be cut into strips 4 inches in width ; this wadding is then to be covered with moist gauze, which keeps it in position ; over this narrow strips of thin wood (fig. 61), so flexible that they can be rolled like a bandage, are to be placed on four sides of the entire length of the limb. Two attendants fix with their hands these long splints until an ordinary plaster bandage. Fig. 62. which has been dipped in water, has been placed round the limb, hy means of which the splints are firmly fixed (fig. 62). Then five or six plaster bandages are used from the toes to the haunches, carrying the bandage well round the hips. Care should be taken that the plaster bandage does not extend over the wadding at the hips and abdomen, and that an orifice (fig. 63) is left for discharges and application of dressings in the event of there being a wound.

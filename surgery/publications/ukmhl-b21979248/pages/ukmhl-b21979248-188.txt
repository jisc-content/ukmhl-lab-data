AMPUTATION. 164 cavity, the knife must be passed behind it and carried down for a distance of about 3 inches close to the bone at its inner side. The surgeon then cuts across the soft parts, so as to form the posterior flap. In doiuL' this the assistant to whom this part is entrusted must follow the knife with his hands, grasping firmly the whole thickness of the posterior flap so as to compress the axillary artery, and thus prevent the occurrence of Sir W. Fergusson recommends that a bistoury be used Jfor these operations, instead of the more imposing-looking amputating knife ; but with such an instrument the first flap on the left shoulder would be made by cutting from the skin towards the joint. Amputation of the Arm (Circular).â€”" The arm being held out, and an assistant drawing up the skin, one circular incision is made through the integuments, which are forcibly retracted and detached from the deeper structures by a few touches of the point of the knife, and doubled back to the extent of an inch and three-quarters, or more, according to the thickness of the arm, another is made down to the bone (fig. 96). These incisions should be made with slight divergences so as to cut the skin and muscles rather longer in front and behind than at the sides." The flap operation in the upper arm is most conveniently done by double transfixion, though the flaps may be cut from without inwards without difficulty. The limb being held away from the trunk by an assistant, the operator grasps the biceps with the brachial vessels and nerves, and draws them well up, and entering the point of the knife upwards close below the thumb, passes it in front of the humerus.

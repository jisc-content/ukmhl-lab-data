The globe is now pressed forwards by the fingers of the operator, and made to protrude through the palpebral aperture, ihe scissors are now introduced either at the inner or outer canthus having their concavity towards the globe. As they reach the back of the eye the blades are opened, and they are pushed in till they are felt to grip the optic nerve, which is then divided. One or two more snips are now required to sever the oblique muscles and any remaining tissues, and the globe is removed. Haemorrhage is easily stopped by firm pres- sure with small sponges and cold water. A light compress should now be applied.—J^M^en APFEOTIONS OF STUMPS. Affections of Stumps may be divided into primary and secondary. Tne Primary consist in haemorrhage, spasm of the muscles, excessive pain, septic inflammation, osteo-myelitis, and inordinate retraction of the soft parts exposing bone. The Secondary consist in necrosis, neuralgia, strumous degeneration, fatty degeneration, aneurismal enlargement of vessels, exfoliation of bone, contraction of the tendons in the neighbourhood of the stump, and the formation of neuromata. With regard to the treatment of these affections— a. Haemorrhage will be considered under that head, p. 199. b. Spasms of the Muscles may be relieved by shifting of position, by bandaging, or by the administration of anodynes. c. Excessive Pain must be relieved by anodynes. d. Septic Inflammation may be relieved by the application of such antiseptic applications and dressings as will combat and interfere with the septic causes of the inflammation. e. Osteo-myelitis has been considered under that head. /. Inordinate Retraction of the soft parts, exposing bone. Nothing can be done for this until the inflammation consequent upon the operation has subsided, when it will be necessary to open up the stump, and re- move the exposed bone. g. Necrosis.—The stump must be opened, and bone removed higher up. h. Neuralgia.—Soothing anodyne applications, such as opium, bella- donna, stramonium, .'or cocaine; if due to neuromata they should be excised. i. Strumous Degeneration.—Secondary amputation may be advan- ' tageously performed.

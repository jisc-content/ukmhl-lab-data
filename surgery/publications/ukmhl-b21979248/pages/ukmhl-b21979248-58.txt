GUN-SHOT FRACTURES. 34 rest on the side poles of the stretcher and give great support to the leg. Counter-extension is made by means of a perineal bandage (piece of cloth or waist-belt) secured to the upper cross-bar of stretcher, a strong elastic ring intervening between the knot and perineal bandage and cross-bar of stretcher. 1 he fractured thigh bone is to be surrounded with a scored spimt and secured with two or three turns of a bandage. Fig. 34. Straw Mats.—Dr. Port suggests the use of straw mats for transporting patients with fracture of the thigh. He du-ects that the mat should be spread out on the ground, and the injured man laid on it in such a manner that the upper edge of the mat wiU project a little above the crests of the hip bones; a chaff or sand bag is to be placed between the thighs, the sides of the mat wrapped round the pelvis and thighs, and the whole secured to the injured man's body with three cords (fig. 35). For fractures of the leg, the following extemporary splints may be constructed with very little trouble :—Fig. 36 is intended to represent a fracture of the leg secured with a splint placed along the outside of the limb, and the whole roUed in a greatcoat or cape fastened by straps or pieces of bandage. Figs. 37 and 38 speak for themselves. In one the legs are tied together at the ankles and placed on a soldier's knapsack, and in the other the legs are also tied together, but they are placed on a board. In securing limbs in such positions, some soft material should be placed imderneath them and in between, so as to fill up spaces and make the parts com- fortable ; if nothing better can be found, hay or straw wiU answer. A fractured leg may be easily put up with the scabbard of a sword

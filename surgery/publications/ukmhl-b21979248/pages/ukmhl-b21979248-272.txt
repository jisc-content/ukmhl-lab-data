Under these conditions, the regulations of 1871 should be strictly observed Company tents should never be arranged in double imes-short single lines are best. The tents in line should be separated Irom each other by a space at the very least equal to a diameter and a lialt ot a tent. Whenever the troops remain in camp more than three if^^'J , ^ ""^"^ ^® ^^^^y ^^ys, all arms, straw, and blankets should be removed from the ground, and the ground should be swept clean and left exposed to the sun and wind. Whenever troops remain more than one night in camp, the tent flys should be roUed up the first thing every morning. In rainy weather the fly may be rolled up on the lee- ward side of the tent. Eemember a camp is a temporary town without paving or proper drainage, hence the great care requisite to ensure a proper surface cleansing, &c.

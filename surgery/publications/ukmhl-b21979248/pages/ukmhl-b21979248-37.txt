INTRODUCTORY GENERAL REMARKS. 13 end with a hatchet or strong knife, and two of them joined together, as shown in fig. 14. These are then attached to side poles by cords, osiers, or other materials, when the framework of a firm stretcher is constructed (fig. 15), on which is to be placed for its bottom a piece of canvas. He has also constructed stretchers with legs, as represented in figs. 16 and Fig. 16. Fig. 17. 17, all of which mi^dit answer for improvised hospital cots, the handles being shortened or removed. Cavalry lances have been recommended for forming the side ijoles of extemporary stretchers ; but they will scarcely bear a weight of 10 stones, are too elastic, and therefore unsafe. Country Carts.â€”When sufficient wheeled carriage or transport suited for the wounded is not available, country carts may be adapted for the purpose by a few simple arrangements. If materials are procurable, a stretcher may be constructed with ropes (fig. 18) of straw, hay, telegraph wire, or leather belts, and slung within Fig. 18. from the sides of the cart, care being taken that the lashings are well secured but not too tight or too loose ; in the former case, the stretcher would receive the impulse from the body of the cart, and in the latter it would knock against its sides. Should means for constructing a stretcher not be at hand, the cart may be filled with small branches of trees evenly placed, and over them a thick layer of straw, hay, rushes, ferns, dried leaves, or any soft material on which the sufferer may be laid. A large quantity of fresh straw evenly laid in a cart wiU form a moderately comfortable conveyance, on which wounded men may be

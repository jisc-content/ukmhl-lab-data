INTRODUCTORY GENERAL REMARKS. 15 to the top side rail [aa) of the wagon outside the side bars, to the front, as in fig. 20; another (B) is similarly lashed to the rear ; this being done at both sides, cross poles (cc) are lashed to the free end of these poles ; these cross poles support the stretchers which are lashed to them. In this manner the wounded in travelling have the advantage of the spring of the longitudinal poles ; to keep this within limits, bands of osier {dd) are placed loosely round them and the top side rail of the wagon.

Fig. 21. Major-General Zavodovsky, of St. Petersburg, has adopted the following plan for preventing all shocks from the motion of trains :—Two cables (AA, fig. 21), an inch in thickness, are suspended across the top of the car, and secured to iron hooks that fasten to iron rings, Ih inches below the roof of the car. If hooks and rings are not available, the ropes may be passed through four holes bored in the side of the car. To each of the two ropes is attached at three points (hhh) a pole of oak, birch, elm, ash,

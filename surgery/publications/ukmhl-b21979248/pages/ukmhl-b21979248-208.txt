The sott parts, including the extensor secundi internodii, and the radial f'S cautiously detached from the bones external to this incision, and the tendons of the radial extensors of the wrist being also severed from their attachments the external bones of the carpus will be exposed. When_ this has been done sufficiently, the next step is to sever the trapezium from the other bones with cutting pliers, in order to facilitate the removal the latter, which should be done as freely as is found convenient. The operator now turns to the ulnar side of the incision, and cleans the carpal and metacarpal bones as much as can be done easily, i he ulnar incision is now made. It should be very free extend- lu^ I?^ ^ ^^^^'^ styloid process down to the middle of ttie htth metacarpal bone, and lying near the anterior edge of the ulna, i he dorsal line of this incision is then raised, along with the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris, which should not be isolated from the skin and should be cut as near its insertion as possible. Then the common extensor tendons should be raised, and the whole of the posterior aspect ot the carpus denuded, until the two wounds communicate quite freely together ; but the radius is not as yet cleaned. The next step is to clean the interior aspect of the ulna and carpus, in doing which the pisiform

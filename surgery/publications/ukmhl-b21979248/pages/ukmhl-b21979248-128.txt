The intestinal wound having been, therefore, duly closed by suture, it should be returned in the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal wound at once closed also Penetrating Wounds of the Abdomen without Protrusion —If the wound has without doubt penetrated the abdominal cavity, the next question that arises is, what injury, if any, has been occasioned to the enclosed viscera? Professor Parkesf states,'as a result of his experi- ments on animals, "that no shook was observed apart from symptoms attributable to loss of blood, and wherever severe prostration occurred there was always extensive hsemorrhage to account for it Guu shot wounds of the intestines are attended with considerable hajmorrba^e great and prolonged shock, lowered temperature, feeble and rapid pulte' restlessness, severe pain, great anxiety, rectal tenesmus ; there is always extravasation of fasces into the peritoneal cavity, although it is very rare for any sign of it to appear externally. The absence of this sjouptom, therefore, would be no proof that the intestine was not wounded.

Inflammation of the veins may be divided into two kinds—idiopathic and traumatic. The idiopathic form as a primary affection is rare, it is usually con- nected with thrombosis, and is met with in gouty subjects and after fevers, and is found most frequently in the long saphenous vein, but occasionally in the deeper veins. "Traumatic phlebitis," Erichsen says, "maybe simple and local, or septic and spreading. The coats of a vein in the same way as any other tissue become inflamed, if submitted to any injury of sufficient intensity, whether it be the application of a ligature in a surgical operation, acci- dental _ mechanical violence, or the action of caustics. As the result of an injury, a clot forms within the vein, and ultimately may become absorbed, or the vessel may become obliterated. But, if the discharges of a wound are in a septic condition, the thrombus in the plugged vein may become infected with micro-organisms. It then softens and decom- poses, and thus excites inflammation in the coats of the vein spreading beyond the part originally injured. Portions of the softened clot are washed on giving rise to dissemination of septic emboli and pyeemia. It is this that has been mistaken for the spreading inflammation of the vein as the primary affection, and led the earlier pathologists to associate phlebitis with pyaemia." Diffuse septic inflammation in the connective tissue may also involve the coats of the veins in the infected area. The Symptoms.—An enlargement of the vein, which becomes hard, swollen, painful, and knobbed, having a reddish-purple colour; stiffness, and severe twitches through the limb, with hard, tense feel, and pitting on pressure, from the state of oedema. Much stress has been laid on this latter symptom by some authorities as a diagnostic sign in deep-

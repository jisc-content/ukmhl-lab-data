Neuritis, if once set up IS very troublesome ; its symptoms are described by Erichsen as intense pam and tenderness in the line of the affected nerve; sensation is variously modified m the parts supplied by the nerve; there may be numbness or tingling or antesthesia, in other cases there may be intense pam ; occasionally there are spasms, but more commonly there is weak- ness or paralysis of some of the muscles supplied. The tender nerve should be freely blistered and the affected Hmb put at rest. Constitutional conditions, as gout, rheumatism, malaria, and syphihs, must be duly treated ; it is in these cases that nerve stretchino- has been attended with success. By the stretching the conductin<^ power oi the nerve is abohshed, but the continuity of the nerve is not destroyed and restoration of function gradually returns. ' The local application of belladonna, chloroform, aconite, blisters, sub- cutaneous injection of morphia and of sulphate of atropia in the propor- tion of I gr. and gr., the administration of mercury, or division of the nerve may be tried. The local use of cocaine in a 4 per cent, solution might be of use. Tendons may be divided by sword-cut.or other sharp weapon, or

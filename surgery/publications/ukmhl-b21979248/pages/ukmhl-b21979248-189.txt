AMPUTATION. 165 depressing the point as it appears on the opposite side close to the operator's fingers. With a steady sawing movement, a flap from 2 to 3 inches long is cut, with the skin left longer than the muscles. Drawing up the flap with his fingers, the operator presses the knife behind the bone and cuts a slightly larger flap behind, bringing out the knife Fi^. 96 abruptly at last. Both flaps being gently retracted, the knife is swept round the bone, which is then sawn through, the thumb and fingers of the left hand protecting the soft tissues. The brachial artery will be found in the anterior flap with the median nerve and the ulnar nerve will be a little posterior. The artery, if cut too long, may be conveniently shortened, and the nerves should always be dra-«Ti out and cut short by an inch or so. The inferior profunda artery will be found in company with the ulnar nerve, and the superior profunda with the musculo-spiral nerve in the posterior flap. —Heath. In very muscular arms the modified circular skin flaps, and circular cut of mnscles would give the best results. Amputation through the Elbow-joint can be performed by the circular method or by flaps. If by the circular, Hamilton recommends "that the incision should commence at least 3 inches below the joint. The integuments being retracted, the head of the radius should be sought, and the external lateral ligament severed; after which, having divided all the muscles, including the tendon of the biceps and the brachialis anticus, the coronoid process of the ulna ■will be easily made out; the anterior ligament and capsule may now be severed more completely, then the external lateral ligament. By moderate pressure upon the forearm the joint will now open sufficiently to admit the saw, if it is thought desirable to sever the olecranon process. It is a matter of

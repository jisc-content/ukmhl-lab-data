This is a description of the first stage of our Bilbao hospital gangrene ; and if a brisk emetic was now exhibited, a surgeon not aware of the disease that was about to form, would be astonished at the amehoration of the sore, and the unusual quantity of bile and indigested matter evacuated by vomiting. If, however, this incipient stage was overlooked, the febrile symptoms very soon became aggravated; the skin around the sore assumed a highly florid colour, which shortly became darker, then bluish, and at last black, with a disposition to vesicate, while the rest of the limb betrayed a tendency to oedema. All these threatening appearances occurred within twenty-four hours; and at this period also the wound, particularly if it was situated on a muscular part of the thigh, buttock, or calf of the leg, whatever might have been its original shape, soon assumed the Circular Form. The sore now acquired hard, prominent, ragged edges, giving it a cup-like appearance, with particular points of the lip of a dirty-yellow hue, while the bottom of the cavity was lined with a flabby blackish slough. " This rapid progress and circular form of the ulcer were highly char- acteristic of hospital gangrene, and obtained almost universally, in every wound infected with it, wherever situated. * Obsej-vations on Military Surgery.

PKEFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. The Third Edition of the Surgeon's Pocket-Book having become ex- hausted, it has been necessary to prepare a new or Fourth Edition, which, it is hoped, will prove as acceptable as the last. Great pains have been taken to bring the work up to the knowledge of the day, and amongst new matter attention has been called to the system "Bry" for fitting up railway goods'wagons as sick carriages. The Field arrangements for the Ambulance of the Army have been corrected, and plans are given for the encampment of the units, viz., a Field Hospital and a Bearer Company. Under the heading of " Wound Treatment" a few remarks have been made upon Surgical Bacteriology, in which an attempt has been made to bring forward the chemical influence of the micro-organisms ; in the Third Edition their biological existence only was considered. Several alterations have consequently had to be made in the pages on Infective Disease. In doing this, great help has been derived from Professor Senn's excellent work on Surgical Bacteriology. Under the heading of " Gun-shot Wounds," reference has been made to the probable effects of the modern narrow bullet. The Chapter on " Abdominal Surgery " has been entirely rewritten. The Editor has to express his obligations to the excellent work " Gun-shot Wounds of the Small Intestines" by Professor C. T. Parkes, Rush Medical College, Chicago, 111., and also to the monograph by Sir Wm. MacCormac] F.R.C.S., on "Abdominal Section for the Treatment of Intra-Peri- toneal Injury."

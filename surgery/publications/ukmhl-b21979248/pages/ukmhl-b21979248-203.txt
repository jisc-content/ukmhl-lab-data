AMPUTATION. 179 Amputation of Distal Phalanx of Great Toe.—When possible, a long flap should be made from the plantar surface, by laying the edge of the knife over the dorsal aspect of the joint, cutting through it, and turnmg the edge of the knife round close to the bone, so as to cut out a long flap from the ball of the toe. Amputation of a Single Lesser Toe: Second, Third, or Fourth.— "This operation is exactly on the same principle as that described for amputation of a whole finger, but it should be remembered that the metatarso-phalangeal joint is more deeply situated in the soft parts than is the metacarpo-phalangeal; and thus the commencement of the elliptical incision which is to surround the base of the toe must be proportionally higher up. On the other hand, as it is very important to avoid as much as possible any cicatrix in the sole of the foot, the plantar end of the incision need not be carried to a point exactly opposite the one from which it set out, but it will be sufficient if it reaches the groove between the toe and sole." Teale's Operation (Amputation).—This plan of operation Mr. Teale introduced "to procure a more useful stump, and in the hope of some- what diminishing the mortality of the operation. It is proposed to amputate by a long and a short rectangular flap, the long flap folding over the end of the bone being formed of parts generally devoid of large blood-vessels and nerves, whilst those important structures are contained in the short flap. The size of the long flap is determined by the circum- ference of the limb at the place of amputation, its length and its breadth being each equal to half the circumference. The long flap is therefore a perfect square (flg. 107), and is long enough to fall easily over the end of the bone. In selecting the structures for its formation, such parts must be taken as do not contain the larger blood-vessels and nerves. A flap s<» Pig. 107. Fig. 108.

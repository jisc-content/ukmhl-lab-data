201 HAEMORRHAGE. Intermittent Hsemorrhage. â€” A remarkable case of intermittent hemorrhage, apparently due to malarial influence, occurred to a weakly soldier under Porter's care at Netley. He had suffered in India from severe fever and ague, which culminated in disease of the left knee-joint, for which Porter amputated the leg through the condyles (Garden's method). The case progressed satisfactorily till the eighth day, when hemorrhage from the stump set in, at intervals preceded by the cold and hot stages of ague. The usual local and constitutional remedies were tried without success, until sulphate of quinine was administered, when the hEemorrhage ceased, as well as the paroxysm of ague, and the man rapidly recovered. Expedients for Suppressing Hsemorrhage may be divided into tem- porary and permanent, such operating either indirectly on the trunks conveying the fluid to the point, or directly on the orifice of the bleeding vessel. In case of severe Hsemorrhage on the Field of Battle, the first impulse on the part of the surgeon or his attendant is to check the bleeding by placing his fingers in the wound, or applying a tourniquet to the main trunk. The latter may not be available ; it would, therefore, be necessary for an attendant to apply pressure with his fingers even during transport, in the event of the bleeding being from a large vessel. Bleeding can frequently be checked by plugging a wound; but this may be followed by grave symptoms, in consequence of the blood becoming diffused, giving rise to an aneurism or to gangrene. The tourniquet is the chief temporary means, which in its primitive state was simply a band to go round the limb, with a pad placed imme- diately over the vessel, and the whole tightened by means of a bayonet or piece of stick. To Petit we are indebted for the screw tourniquet j and since his time there have been many modifications, nearly all with a view to stop

WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. lOO incisions or lacerations of the abdominal walls, the parts should be adjusted and kept in position by means of sutures or stitches, suf- ficiently deep to keep the divided str^uctures in exact co-aptation and so prevent ventral protrusions. The quilled suture appears to have ansvvered the best purpose (fig. 81) in the American War. The sutures should be allowed to remain until the fourth or fifth day, and the loop of each double thread then being cut, the pieces should be withdrawn simultaneously m opposite directions. If carbolised gut sutures are used, they will soften and come out by themselves. The position of the sufferer during treatment should be such that the muscles of the abdomen are relaxed by elevating the shoulders and head, and flexing the lower limbs. ^ Fig. 81.â€”Application of the quilled suture to an incised wound. A bullet may strike the abdomen obliquely and pass between the muscles and the skin, or between the peritoneum and the muscles, giving rise to alarming symptoms, causing violent pain, vomiting, and general derangement, such as prolonged collapse, followed by extensive peri- tonitis or suppuration. In the event of suppuration, an early opening should be made to prevent the possibility of pus perforating the peri- toneum. Should a bullet or other missile be lodged deeply in the abdominal walls, Gruthrie suggests that it is often better left alone, unless it prove troublesome. This, according to the extensive experience of Mr. Otis, " is unsound ;" he considers there are no other exceptions to the general rule of extracting foreign bodies, than the instances in which they are so situated in vital organs that their extraction may immediately jeopar- dise life. It is, he says, especially important to extract them from the abdominal walls, as they present a constant source of danger while they remain.

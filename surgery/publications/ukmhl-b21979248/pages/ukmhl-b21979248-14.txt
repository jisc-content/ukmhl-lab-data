vi PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. to a Continental town, with every comfort and appliance at hand, and those of others with similar wounds on such a field as that of Alma, Magdala, or Coomassie, with the necessity for immediate long transport and exposure—how different must be the plans of treatment adopted in some of these injuries ! I have included several subjects which might at first sight be con- sidered extraneous to the purpose of a surgical manual; such are—a scale of hospital diets, construction of cooking-places, of camp ovens, extemporary water-filters, and latrines; but, from experience in the field, I know how important for the present comfort of patients and the ultimate results of their injuries it is that the surgeon should have memoranda on these matters at hand for easy reference. Information on these points formed a portion of the contents of the original Essay, but to the present publication I have also appended the Formulary of Prescriptions which is now in general use in Military Hospitals. I have found the use of this formulary a means of facilitating work and saving time, and have therefore thought it would prove a convenient addition to the Manual. In the preparation of this Essay I lay no claim to literary merit or originality. My object has been simply to present to the surgeon such information as I myself found the want of during my campaigns; and in doing so I have extensively made use of the labour of others, to whom I am indebted, but who, like myself, will, I am sure, be well rewarded, if their efforts tend to mitigate in the smallest degree the sufferings of the unfortunate wounded in war.

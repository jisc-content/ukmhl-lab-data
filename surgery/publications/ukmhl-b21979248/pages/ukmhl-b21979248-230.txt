2o6 LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. Catgut ligatures are now chiefly used, and to enable the cateiit to acquire the necessary strength, it is prepared in a mature of &i^ tiss^i^ji^.^^^^^-^ ^^-^'i be keptr ^: A specially prepared carbolised silk ligature is also used by some sur- geons. Others again, use ligatures of ox aorta and kangaroo tSons When any of these specially prepared materials are used for tW arteries, after the knot has been securely tied both ends are cut off aS^ the knot remains in the wound until absorbed. ihe following table may assist in showing when the separation of theold ''^^-"^ ^^^^^^'^ ^'^^ ^^^^'^ ^^teries miy be anticipated, at which period haemorrhage may occur :— > Common iliac, 18th to 25th day ; external iliac, 15th to 22nd day • femoral 14th to 2hth day; subclavian, 17th day; carotid, 2Uth da^ i brachial, 21st day ; axillary, 22nd day. ' The rules for tying the principal arteries have been taken from Mr xleatn s valuable work on Operative Surgery. Ligature of the Common Carotid.-This operation may be performed above or below the omo-hyoid muscle. Above the Omo-hyoid.-The patient must be placed on his back, with the shoulders supported by a pillow. An incision 2^ to 3 inches in len<^th is to be made exactly on the anterior obUque border of the sterno-mastoid muscle immediately opposite the larynx, so that the middle of the incision may correspond to the level of the cricoid cartilage. The incision should be carried at once through the platysma, superficial cervical nerves, and fascia to expose the muscular fibres of the sterno-mastoid. Should the external jugular cross the line of incision, it should be tied with two hgatures before being cut. The anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid is to be turned back until the angle formed between it and the omo-hyoid is clearly defined. The sterno-mastoid is then to be held back by an assistant while the operator dissects forward the outer edge of the omo- hyoid, which is then to be held with a hook, so as to increase the space between the two muscles. In doing this, a large anterior jugular vein may be seen, and must be carefully preserved. The exact position of the artery being ascertained, the sheath is to be opened with knife and forceps directly over it. The outer side of the sheath being grasped with the forceps, the needle is to be passed close to the artery from without inwards. Belowthe Omo-hyoid.—An incision 3 inches in length along the anterior border of the lower third of the sterno-mastoid will allow that muscle to be reflected outwards [with, or without division of its sternal attachments) until the muscles passing upwards to the hyoid bone are exposed. The outermost muscle is the omo-hyoid, and this is to be separated from the sterno-hyoid, when the broad sterno-thyroid will be seen beneath them, pushed up by the thyroid gland. The finger carried between the omo- hyoid and sterno-thyroid will distinguish the carotid in its sheath lying against the vertebrae. The sheath is to be opened with knife and forceps, and the artery fully exposed, vsdthout injuring the descendens noni nerve, when the needle may be passed from without inwards.

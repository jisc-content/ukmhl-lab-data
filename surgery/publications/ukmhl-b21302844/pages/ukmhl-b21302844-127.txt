A man, aet. 22, had presented during life all the symptoms of a cerebral tumour, and post mortem a carcinomatous growth the size of an apple was found in the posterior fossa of the skull on the left side, growing from the dura mater. Ladame and other writers say that tumours of the posterior lobes cause no symptoms, but in this case there had been amaurosis of the right and amblyopia of the left eye. Another in- teresting fact was that, in spite of the situation of the tumour, the sight of the right eye was affected earlier and to a greater degree than that of the left. 8 0 Choupe (‘ Arch, de Phys.,’ v, 209) publishes the case of a woman, zet. 45, who had had right-sided hemiplegia for twenty years, and presented symptoms of brain tumour. After death a fatty tumour was found between the right olfactory and the longitudinal fissure, and two others on the upper surface of the corpus callosum (cf. case of same kind re- corded by Coats, below). C. Kelly found (‘Path. Soc. Trans.,’ xxiv, 6) in a boy, zet. 11, who had presented cerebral symptoms, a papillomatous tumour occu- pying and distending the fourth ventricle. It pushed up the valve of Yieussens and pushed outwards the cerebellum on each side while it also grew downwards and appeared at the base of the brain on the left side of the medulla. It was tremulous and of irregular shape, granular on surface, and of a yellow or reddish-yellow colour •

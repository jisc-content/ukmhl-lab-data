138 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. tion and thickening of the pericardium, due to a firm, yellowish, homo- geneous-looking growth, occupying the anterior mediastinum and reach- es above to the thyroid on the left and to the diaphragm below on tliG right. The chief mass of the tumour was situated in front of and around the base of the heart, completely embedding the great vessels at the root of the neck and the arch of the aorta, and closely adhe- rent to them, but apparently not lessening their calibre. The tumour blended insensibly with the pericardium, and was adherent anteriorly to the sternum, &c. Several nodules of the new growth had infiltrated the muscular tissue of the heart, different parts of the lungs, and the diaphragm. The lungs were displaced laterally, and airless, except at their apices. The microscopic appearance of the growth from the dif- ferent parts was that of small round cells, without any fibrous stroma.

Times and Graz.,’ 1874,1, 644, and ii, 3$) the following cases of effimon in which the pneumatic aspirator was employed :—1. Grirl, set. 8, effusion on left side, paracentesis, re- covery. 2. Boy, set. 4, empyema of left side, paracentesis repeated four times, with establishment of fistulous openings; later, enlargement of spleen and liver, with albuminuria. 3. Girl, tet. 3-f, empyema of left side, paracentesis repeated once, recovery. 4. Girl aet. 2-|, empyema of right side, paracentesis, recovery. 5. Boy, ast. 3 years, empyema of left side, paracentesis, apparent recovery, relapse, paracentesis repeated with relief, subsequent and sudden death after leaving the hospital. 6. Boy, set. 4, empyema of left side, paracentesis on two occasions, recovery. 7. Boy, set. 10-b, pleurisy, evacuation of 32 ounces of serum, convalescence in seven days. 8. Girl, set. 2. In this case the diagnosis was somewhat doubtful and the child was not tapped, but after death the left pleural cavity was found full of thick, non-fetid pus (about 24 ounces), the right pleural cavity also contained about six ounces of pus. 9. Boy, set. 9, empyema of right side, paracentesis on three occasions with relief after each operation. In some concluding remarks (1. c., ii, 35) the writers state that in nearly all the cases the puncture was entirely healed in two or three days, and that the use oi the aspirator shortens very much the duration of cases of pleuritic effusion or empyema. The cases published in the French and Italian periodicals are mainly of a very simple nature. B. Tripier gives one (‘Lyon Med.,’ xiv, 433)

Arch., lvii, 532) records the following case. A man, set. 44, who had for some time suffered from intermittent fever, with enlarge- ment of the spleen, injured the left side of his abdomen in mounting his horse. Symptoms of inflammation presented themselves, followed by leuchsemia, with large increase in the number of white blood-cor- puscles ; pain over the sternum, hut no enlargement of the glands. The patient died suddenly from haemorrhage due to follicular ulcera- tion of the stomach. The marrow of the sternum was of a dirty greyish-white appearance; several irregular cavities about the size of a pea existed in the spongy substance of the body of the bone, one place about the size of an almond exactly resembling a bone-abscess. The medullary tissue of a lumbar vertebra and one thigh presented a similar dirty yellowish colour; the medullary vessels contained here and there numerous white blood-corpuscles. Huber (“Zur Myelogenen Leukamie,” ‘Deut. Arch.,’ xii, 389) gives an exactly similar case. A man, set. 43, had been subject to rigors of short duration for eight years. For two years before lie came under obser- vation he had complained of loss of power, dyspnoea, and cough. His 1 « In a little but most interesting work by M. Vergnaud-Romagnesi, called ‘ Orleans et ses environs/ be speaks of two little villages, Val and Sologne, near Orleans, separated only by a few fields. The inhabitants of the latter are called Solognots, an unfortunate, sorry race. From tbe age of three years they contract a disease of the stomach called carreau, which never leaves them while they stay at borne, but is cured tbe moment they quit tbe village. Their hair becomes exceedingly dark, and their complexion leaden. Very large and disfiguring teeth, that fall out in premature old age. A shrill voice, and small, almost deformed figures."—' Our Autumn Holiday on French Rivers/ London, 1874, p. 255.

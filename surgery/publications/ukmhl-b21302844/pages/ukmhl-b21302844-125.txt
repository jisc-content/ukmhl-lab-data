Meningitis, Hydrocephalus, Haemorrhage. Behier (‘Graz. Hebei.,’ 1873, 148) gives the case of a drunkard, mt. 30, who during life had presented tremors, dulness of intelligence, slight contraction of the right upper extremity, and hyperaesthesia of the left thigh. He died of pneumonia, and post mortem was found a calcified heematoma within the meninges and the left side of the brain, pressing on and flattening the brain-substance beneath, with recent pachymeningitis in the neighbourhood. In addition there was tuberculosis of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and of the base of the brain, which had not been accom- panied by any of the usual symptoms during life. Bierbaum (‘Deut. Klin.,’ 1873, 81) gives an account of the usual pathologial and anatomical characters of tubercular meningitis. He also gives (ib., 184) a history of three cases which recovered (? diag- nosis.— Rep.), and (ib., 310, &c.) thirty-one further histories unaccom- panied by autopsies. Beigeret ( Lyon Med., xiii, relates the following. A. woman who had been infected by her husband thirty years previously, but had completely recovered, suffered from violent headache with great thirst and polyuria and vomiting. She died suddenly and the autopsy showed thickening of the meninges, with numerous small points of suppura- tion, adhesions of the pia mater, and great congestion, while the con- sistence of the anterior lobes was very soft. The diagnosis durino- fife had been a gummatous tumour in the fourth ventricle, and the writer is in doubt whether he really had to deal with inflammation of the brain or with meningitis, or with the two combined.

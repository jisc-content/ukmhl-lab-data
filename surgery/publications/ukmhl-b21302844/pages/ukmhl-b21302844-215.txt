Lymphosarcoma, Sfc. E. Schulz writes (‘Arch. d. Heilk.,’ xv, 19.3) on “Desmoid-carci- noma.” By this term he understands a malignant." atypical connective- tissue new growth” in opposition to epithelial-carcinoma as an “atypical new growth,” and under it he includes all growths which have been described as lymphosarcoma, malignant lymphosarcoma, lymphadenorna, pseudoleuchcemic tumours, &c. He gives the literature of the subject and the results of seven cases, with a minute account of the seat and course of the affection. He points out that these growths are essentially comiective-tissue growths, spreading only in the interstitial tissue of organs, while the epithelial portions—as for instance the liver- cells, the epithelium of the testis, &c.—take no part in this new forma- tion, but are destroyed. He distinguishes the hard and soft varieties, the former having been fully described by Langhans. The affection rapidly leads to death by cachexia, usually in two years, one case only living for three and a half years. In conclusion he expresses the opinion that leuchfemia may depend upon a chronic desmoid carcinoma of the spleen.

The clinical antecedents of this condition of the urine are, generally, of three kinds—obstacles to the escape of the. urine, loss of expulsive power, and vesical or, very rarely, pelvic irritation. In cases otherwise so tending, catheterization, lithotrity, &c., may. at times apparently light up the condition, thus stigmatised as “ surgical kidney,” which would be better distinguished clinically as uriseptic. The coarse of the disease resembles that of pyaemia, differing from it in the usual exemption of other organs from the suppurative process.

51 INFLAMMATION—CONTAGION > pushed, by mechanical pressure, through the stigmata and stomata of the vessel wall. By the same mechanical process.they may be carried away further, perhaps into the lymphatics. Their end is also passive, as he has noticed them, whether in groups or separately, becoming gradually colourless, and finally breaking up ; and these appearances, he thinks, have led other writers to describe certain corpuscle-holding Ct: Binz (ib., lix, 293), while adopting Cohnheim’s view as to the wandering of the white blood-cells in suppuration, holds that a supply of oxygen is needed in order that the cells may exert their amoeboid motion. The origin of the oxygen lie finds in the red blood-cells, which he believes supply it to the white. He has noticed that the white cells have become crowded and inactive in a blood-vessel during the process of inflammation, and have taken on amoeboid movements, and so been able to pass through the walls only after a few red cells have made their way among them. _ . , Apolant (ib., 299) writes on the relation of the white to the red blood-cells after suppuration. He gives the case of a boy, set. 4 months, who presented a succession of small pustules or abscesses. When first noticed, the relation of the white to the red blood-cells was 1. to 20. As the child improved and the abscesses diminished the relation became 1 to 200. He thinks it probable that the leucocytosis was due to a draining off of the white blood-cells in the process of suppuration. His experiments on animals with a view to clearing up the question do not present any decided results. S. Samuel, ‘ Der Entziindungsprozess,’ Leipzig, 1873, pp. 90. E.

New Growths; Hydronephrosis, Sfc. J. y. Perewerseff writes (‘ Virch. Arch.,’ lix, 227) 011 the development of cancer in the kidney, confirming the view that it originates in the epithelium of the renal tubules. He gives a very full account, with plates, of the post-mortem examination of a case, and its microscopical results; at first there is mainly a growth of the epithelium, followed by secondary growth of the connective tissue. Jolly (‘Berl. Klin. Woch.,’ 1873, 241) gives the following case. A girl, set. 19, perfectly well up to August, 1872, caught cold, took to her bed with malaise, fell into an apathetic condition, and refused to take food. The pulse was slow, the temperature normal. The urine had to be drawn off, and was scanty and high coloured. At first it contained no albumen, but traces appeared on the fifth day, and increased rapidly to an intense albuminuria. There was no oedema; the pulse became small and quick; the cerebral symptoms increased, with lucid intervals, and there was profuse menorrhagia. On the twelfth day she was sent to an asylum, her restlessness and excitement subdued by injections of morphia,and her foodgiven forcibly. About the twenty-sixth day thealbu- men began to decrease, and in a few days completely disappeared ; there was then incontinence of urine and of faeces, but she gradually im- proved and at the time of the last note was in perfect health. Jolly considers this as one of those less frequent cases in which symptoms of insanity were caused by the kidney disturbance, and refers to four cases published by Hagen in 1870, as follows :—1. A woman, set. 46, caught cold, and had acute delirium; after death both kidneys were found to be atrophied. 2. A case of melancholia, with hydronephrosis of the right, with granular left, kidney. 3. A man, set. 73, after suffering from mania for a year and a half, was found to have only one kidney. 4. A man, ill for 20 years, latterly with symptoms of melancholia, died at last with contracted kidneys and waxy liver. . Loomis publishes (‘ Hew York Med. Journ.,’ xx, 60) the termina- tion of a case of pyo-nephrosis (see ib., xix, 608). The patient died 72 hours after the operation; the abdominal tumour measured inches in length by 6 in width and 3 in depth, and was made up of kidney tissue ; the ureter was dilated so as to admit the index finger and was occluded about an inch above its entrance into the bladder.

58 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. on the greater or less amount of heat required by the law of compen- sation. Cold baths (io° C.) cause marked decrease in temperature. Their first immediate after-effect is essentially a cooling of the whole body ; but this is followed by an absolute increase in temperature—a confirmation of the law of compensation. Quinine has very little influence on the temperature of the healthy body, the curve, however, showing a tendency to follow the “ straight-line type.” According to the writer the law of compensation shows itself in disease, when eleva- tions of temperature are caused by some hurtful agent, and where by certain means it is possible to bring it down to the normal. Tor this reason cold baths, which in the healthy subject increase the temperature, have no such effect in febrile cases; while quinine, inactive in the healthy subject, shows its effect in the course of fever. E. Casey gives (‘Lancet,’ 1873, i, 200) a table of the diurnal varia- tions of temperature as observed in his own case. The mean tempera- ture was 98-o7° ; the highest reading was 99'6°, the lowest 96,4°. In the morning before getting up the temperature was below the mean of the day. A rise then began, continuing till midday. Erom this time till 7'30 p.m., at which hour the maximum was reached, the tempera- ture was considerably above the mean height. Then it fell rapidly till 2 a.m., when the minimum occurred. E. Riegel (‘Deut. Arch.,’xii, 79) finds from careful observations that after large doses of wine or alcohol, given at short intervals, the temperature in the rectum and axilla very frequently, though not always, falls some tenths of a degree after a short time ; in some cases, however, it rises. This occurs both in healthy persons and those already in a condition of pyrexia. J. Laycoclc, “ On the Clinical Observation and Practical Estimate of Morbid Tem- perature,” ‘ Med.

PANCRAS, MIDDLESEX. Poisons. Phosphorus.—Dr. Andant,1 of Dax, has published a prize thesis on poisoning by phosphorus in which the various theories relative to the mode in which that poison acts are discussed, and the various kinds of treatment that have been adopted are detailed. Preference is given to oil of turpentine, and several striking recoveries under this method of treatment are detailed. Dr. George Wegner2 has experimented with phosphorus upon animals, and finds even such small doses of phosphorus as produce no poisonous action upon the organism may excite osteo-plastic processes to greater energy. Hence arises a needful caution in the use of phosphorus as a remedy. A committee of the Society of Legal Medicine in Paris3 has reported as to whether in the absence of any trace of unoxidized phosphorus in suspected matters, and of the characteristic morbid or post-mortem appearances, such as the fatty degeneration of the liver, it may be concluded from a supposed abnormal quantity of phosphoric acid or ammonio-magnesium phosphate in the articles submitted to analysis, that there has heen phosphorus poisoning. The committee agree with Tardieu and Eoussin that the mere presence of phosphoric acid proves nothing, and say that, having regard to the variable proportion of phos- phorus in the chief articles of dietary, the quantity of phosphorus found in suspected matters on analysis is not a conclusive proof that there has been poisoning by phosphorus; nor that the quantity of ammonio- magnesium phosphate in such matters can be regarded as affording 1 ‘Ann. d’Hyg./ t. xxx, p. 397. 2 ‘Virchow’s Archiv,’ Iv, p. 11. 3 ‘Ann. d’Hyg.,’ xlii, p. 61. 29

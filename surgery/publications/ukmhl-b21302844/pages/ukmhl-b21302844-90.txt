REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. so catarrh of, and in some cases haemorrhage from, the stomach and small intestines, and membranous deposits in the colon, were noticed as com- plications. The writer does not lay much stress on the catarrhal jaundice, which occurred in 24 per cent, of the whole number of cases. 0. Obermeier (‘Centralbl.,’ 1873, 145) draws attention to the occur- rence in the blood of patients suffering from relapsing fever of certain peculiar vibrio-like bodies (“ Spirilla? ”). He is supported by K. Blie- sener (‘Ueber Eebris Recurrens,’ Berlin, 1873, pp. 31), by E. Engel (‘TJeber die Obermeyer’schen Recurrensspirillen,” ‘Berk Klin. Woch., 1873, 409), and by Weigert (“ Erfahrungcn in Betreff der Ober- meyer’schen Recurrensfaden,” ib., 589). These observers generally agree in the fact that these bodies are present in the apyretic, but not in the pyretic, period of the affection. Ponfick (‘Centralbl.,’ 1874, 385) has noticed, in addition to the above, certain abnormal cells in the blood of these patients, which seem to be akin to those of the spleen-pulp, and according to his view are dia- gnostic and pathognomonic of relapsing fever. Whether these cells really originate in the spleen itself lie leaves undecided. II. Budberg, ‘ Ueber Febris recurrens: Eine Skizze der Berliner Epidemie von 1872 und 1873, Soweit dieselbe in der Med.

Insolalio {Sunstroke). W. II. Katzenbach (‘Hew York Med. Journ.,’ xvii, 91) writes on 55 cases of sunstroke admitted into the Bellevue Hospital during the summer of 1872. Of these, eight are briefly reported. There were 23 deaths, in most cases from apnoea, in many by rapid asthenia. Autopsies were made in three; the brain and membranes were congested in two, in the other antemic ; in all three the other viscera were congested. The Acute Exanthemata. A. Monti writes (‘Jahrb. f. Kinderheilk.,’ vi, 20) on the changes which take place in the mucous membranes in the acute exanthemata. In 12^ cases of measles he found little or no characteristic affection in oniy five, and these were suffering from some chronic disease. In normal cases the mucous membrane of the throat is affected twenty-two or twenty-four hours before the eruption appears. The posterior pillars and posterior wall of the pharynx are more intensely red than the anterior pillars and soft palate. ' Later on the redness disappears from the pharynx, and an eruption of red spots and papules covers the soft

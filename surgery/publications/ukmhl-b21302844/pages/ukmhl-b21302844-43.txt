SPECIAL SENSE. 83 For other papers see Langerhans,1 Gr. Thin,2 Klug.:i _ Honigschmeid1 has given the details of his examination of the goblet cells of the tongues of various mammals. Dr. Martin6 describes the olfactory epithelium of the newt, frog, and dog, and corroborates the statements of Max Schultze to the effect that there are two forms of cells anatomically distinct from each other. Cisoff,0 in a paper on the recognition of the olfactory region, has been able to isolate fine fasciculi of nerves in connection with true olfactory cells. Paschutin 7 maintains that there is a distinct difference between the olfactory cells and ordinary epithelium. He has not been able to trace a connection between the cells and the nerve fibres. Brunn 8 has discovered a membrana limitans olfactoria covering the free surface of the epithelium in the olfactory region. The mode of termination of nerves has been the subject of examina- tion by Y. v. Ebner,9 Jullien,10 Inzani,11 Eimer,12 Gr. Asp,13 * Budge,11' and Palladino.15 Y. Ebner distinguishes three different kinds of epithelium on the crista acustica of the ampullae of birds :— i. Cylindrical cells, supporting long and fine hairs, which project into the cavity of the ampulla. 2. Fusi- form thread cells, w'hich form three or four layers beneath the fore- going. And 3. Basal cells in contact with the cartilage. He thinks the nerves may either divide and subdivide, the extremities ending as fine filaments between the epithelial cells, or that the nerves first join the thread cells, from which fibres are given off that run between the columnar cells and form the true termination of the nerves. Eimer has not been able to trace any connection between nerve- fibres and the branched corpuscles of the epidermis described by various writers, which are stained deeply by chloride of gold. Gr. Asp has been unable to corroborate Pfliiger’s statements in regard to the 1 ‘Max Scbiiltze’s Arcliiv f. Microp. Anat.,’B. ix, p. 730-447.

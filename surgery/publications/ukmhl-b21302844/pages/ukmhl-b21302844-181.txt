O. Leiclitenstern writes an extremely long and valuable paper (‘ Vierteljakrsschr. f. Prakt. Heilk.,’ 1873, iii, 189 ; iv, 59 ; 1874, i, 17) on intestinal invagination, based on records of 593 cases. He gives tables of the results noticed, and enters at length into various points connected with the affection. He finds that intussusception is more frequent in males than females, most frequent in the first year of life (in 131 of the cases), almost stationary between six and forty years, again increasing, especially after the age of fifty. It is most frequent between the fourth and sixth months of life. Its most common form is ileo-cgecal, especially during the first year of life. Intussusception of the small intestines, save during that period, is more common in adult life. Ascending or retrogressive intussusception, whether of the large or small intestines, is rare. Cases of multiple invagination, double, or even triple, forming five or seven layers, have been recorded, but are very rare; with one exception they were cases of primary ileo-ctecal intussusception, never of the small intestines. Lateral or partial intus- susceptions, consisting originally of pouch-like invaginations of the intestinal wall, produced by polypi, are also very rare. He describes the two modes in which internal hernia and intussusception occur, either through a fold of the mesentery or a loop of the jejunum or ileum, and discusses at greater length the etiology, symptoms, and diagnosis of the affection. The third and last part of the paper is taken up with therapeutical methods, with special reference to the disentangling of the intussuscepted portion.

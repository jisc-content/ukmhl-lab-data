REPOUT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. 142 of coma on the tenth clay from the commencement of his illness. At the autopsy a thick fibrinous plug occluded the right bronchus and its branches; there was soft infiltration of the lower part of the left lung ; the third and fourth right ribs were carious. The plugs which he had expectorated during life and that found post mortem agreed com- pletely, being 11 cm. long aud i-g- to 2 cm. in diameter, coming, therefore, from the same place in the right lung. The epithelium of the bronchus was in parts gone ; microscopically the plug was made up of four layers. This structure and the rapid reproduction point, according to the writer, to their origin in croupous exudation. C. G-erhardt thinks (‘ Berk Klin. Woch.,’ 1873, 23) that the expira- tory act in emphysema may be aided and strengthened by pressure with the hands. He used this means on two patients suffering from this affection two or three times daily for a period of twenty to thirty respi- rations, and watched the increase of vital lung-capacity of both. Other consequences of this mode of treatment were slight haemorrhages from the bronchi in both the patients, and twitchings of the facial muscles in one of them.

Haring (‘ Ueber Bronchialasthma,’ Halle, 1873) thinks that the symptoms of asthma are not sufficiently accounted for by the reasons upon which other writers lay weight, especially spasm of the bronchi or diaphragm ; he would rather look for their origin in an acute catarrh of the smaller bronchi, caused, probably, by vaso-motor paralysis of the small vessels of the respiratory passages, and gives six cases in support of his theory.

Letzerich (“ Ueber die Lungenmycose beim Keuchhusten nebsfc Angabe einer Methode zur Heilung des letzteren,” ‘ Virch. Arch.,’ lvii, 518) finds a fungus in the air-passages, to which he thinks whooping- cough is due. This fungus, he believes, in the more serious cases pene- trates into the air-vesicles, but does not, like his diphtheria-fungus (see last (Keport,’ p. 102), work its way into the circulation.

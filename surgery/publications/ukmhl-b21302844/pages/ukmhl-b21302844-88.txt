Typhus. O. Obermeier (“Die ersten Falle und der Charakter der Berliner Flecktyphus Epideinie von 1873,” ‘ Berl. Klin. Woch.,’ 1873, 349) ob- served the first cases of this affection which occurred in Berlin in 1873. He records that a patient, convalescent from relapsing fever, and attacked a fortnight later by typhus, was admitted into the general ward of the hospital. "Within the next fourteen days eleven patients and three attendants took the disease. Three of the persons attacked died, and six of the whole number were recovering from relapsing fever. Though exposed to the same contagion at the same time, some were attacked earlier than others; and he concludes that long continuance in the contagious atmosphere confers no immunity, andithat the disposition to take contagion varies in individuals. This affection seems to have broken out almost simultaneously in the most different parts of the town, and as far as could be discovered the sufferers were persons who had been settled for years in Berlin. Whether it was imported or not is doubtful, and he leaves it an open question whether its appearance in several dirty quarters of the town was a proof of its spontaneous or its epidemic origin. The disease appeared in January, was at its highest in March and April, and declined in the summer. The same author (‘ Centralbl.,’ 1873, 561) gives the results of his experiments in reference to the contagion of typhus and relapsing fever. Blood from affected patients was injected, either subcutaneously or into the jugular veins of dogs, rabbits and guinea-pigs, with negative result. No infection followed the introduction of the blood into cracks, whether purposely or accidentally made, in the skin of healthy men. He refers to the fact that the animals experimented upon never take either fever, though frequently in the contagious atmosphere and in contact with affected persons. (Cf. with this Wolfhugel’s remark, p. 71 of this Beport.) Y. Michaud (‘ Glaz. Hebd.,’ 1873, 38) and C. Visy (ib., 56) write on the occurrence of typhus among the civil population of Metz, due to the want and overcrowding after the siege. A lon^ discussion on the origin of typhus fever took place in the Paris Academy of Medicine (‘Bull, de l’Acad. do Med., 1873, 53^)>

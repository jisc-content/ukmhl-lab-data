REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. 106 headache, vomiting, and photophobia. The sight of both eyes, espe- cially of the right, was gradually impaired, the right eye becoming also more and more prominent. With this there was some weakness of the extremities on the left side. At the beginning of November, 1872, the right temple presented a gradually increasing prominence, with tran- sient oedema of the eyelid and conjunctiva of the same side, and in- cision was followed by the evacuation of about ninety echinococcus-cysts, varying in size from a fist to a small pea. The patient gradually recovered, and the paralysis of the left side disappeared. Mescbede (‘Deut. Klin.,’ 1873, 295) records a case in which cysticerci were found in the cortical substance of the cerebrum, without having produced any cerebral symptoms during life. The patient was a man, aged 38. The microscope showed degeneration of the ganglia in the immediate neighbourhood of the cysts, which were three in number, and about the size of peas. Mosler, writing (‘ Yirch. Arch.,’ lvii, 529) on the length of life and retention in the body of bothriocephalus latus, gives two cases of its occurrence in men, aged 36 and 24. The first probably got the worm in St. Petersburg, in 1859, and in spite of the profuse diarrhoea of typhoid and the high temperature of intermittent fever through which he passed, and in spite also of various “worm-cures,” did not get rid of it till 1873, fourteen years later. The second patient carried the worm, which he had probably caught in French Switzerland, for six years. E. B. Gray and H. M, Tuckwell give (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1874, i, 682) three cases in which round worms proved a veritable plague. A boy, set. 6, passed between March 4 and 21 thirty-two of these worms per amm; a woman, set. 48, passed, per anum, thirty-one, and vomited five; and a woman, set. 47, still under treatment, has vomited during the eight months preceding this note (May, 1874) twenty-four round worms, and thinks it likely that she may have passed others by stool. Her husband has also vomited these worms, while all her chil- dren, seven in number, are frequently in the habit of either passing or vomiting them, one having passed four after a dose of senna tea the previous week. The mother herself has, after santonine, which was given in all the cases, passed, since April 11, twenty-one round worms.

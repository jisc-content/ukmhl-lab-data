Trans.,’ xxiv, 40) a case of extreme aortic stenosis in a woman, set. 55- She had ^ad a severe at,ta,ck °/ not fever at the age of 33, followed by another five years later, but bad not complained of any cardiac symptoms till half a year befoie death. The apex of the heart could be felt in the seventh intercostal space, and the area of dulness was greatly increased. There was a loud, coarse, and unusually long systolic murmur everywhere over the pre- cordia, and considerably beyond. The dyspnoea at times was very urgent, she had frequent fainting-fits, and died suddenly whim sleeping. The pericardium was found to be universally adherent. On slit mg open the aorta down to the level of the valves the aortic opening was found to be almost completely occluded by a calcareous mass which was merely perforated near its centre by an orifice barely admitting a No. 6 catheter, and so effectually overgrown by vegetations that water would not pass either from the aorta into the ventricle or vice versa without considerable pressure. The walls of the left ventricle, which was dilated, measured ten lines in their thickest part. The mitral and tricuspid valves, though slightly thickened, were compe- tent ; the liver was nutmeg and cirrhotic, the kidneys contracted.

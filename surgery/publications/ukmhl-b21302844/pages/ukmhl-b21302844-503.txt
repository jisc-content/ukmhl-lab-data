CLIMATOLOGY. 4-9$ tality is greatly increased by neglect of early antipyretic treatment and insufficient nourishment. i Grotz1 gives the following statistics of the cold water treatment of typhus and typhoid in the Vienna Hospital. In typhoid with the ex- pectant treatment the mortality was 28'72 per cent.; under the cold water treatment only 15'4 per cent. In typhus, on the other hand, under the expectant treatment the mortality was a7*97 Per cenV; while under the cold water treatment the mortality rose to Riegel2 obtains good results from the cold water treatment of enteric fever. Of 156 cases treated in the Julius Hospital, in Wiirtzburg, during 1870 and 1871, only seven died, while in the same hospital before the introduction of this method of treatment the mortality was 20 per cent. Climatology.—Dr. H. E. Richter3 has written an exhaustive mono- graph on medicinal meteorology. It is, however, too long for abstraction. Analysis of drugs.—Dr. G. Dragendorff,4 of Dorpat, has published an invaluable treatise on the analysis and determination of the value of the chief drugs. He treats of aconite, belladonna, hyoscyamus, ipecacuanha, conium, tobacco, guarana, nux vomica, colchicum, opium, chelidonium, cantharides, and aloes. Each article contains much valu- able information, interesting alike to the pharmaceutist and the physician. 1 ‘Prager Yrtljahrsachrift,,’ 1872, 38. 2 ‘ Deut. Arch. f. Klin.

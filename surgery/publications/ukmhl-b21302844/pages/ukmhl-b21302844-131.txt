Westphal (“ Die fleckweise oder disseminirte Myelitis,” ‘ Arch, f. Psych.,’ iv, 338) writes on disseminated myelitis (“sclerose en plaques ”), in which sections of the cord made at various heights show patches of affected white and grey substance separated from one another by portions of normal tissue. He gives two cases occurring in men, aged respectively 32 and 22, attacked with varioloid, in whom this condition was found. In the first case paralysis of the bladder occurred eleven days after the eruption, followed by paralysis of the left leg on the twelfth day and of the right leg on the thirteenth. In the second case there was paraplegia, commencing a few days after the eruption showed itself. The autopsies and microscopical appearances, with plates, are given in full. He compares with these two of Damas- chino’s cases of “infantile spinal paralysis,”1 in which smallpox and dysentery seemed to have been the starting points of the affection, and, in addition to cases reported by West and others, quotes one from Heine, in which this form of paralysis—not to be confounded with that often occurring after acute fevers—followed scarlet fever. He argues, in conclusion, that no difference can be made out pathologically be- tween the disease as it occurs in adults and in children. He gives a third case in which the same morbid change was found after death from phthisis, preceded by paralysis of the extremities and bladder. Bernhardt (ib., 370) discusses almost the same question in a paper “On an Affection of Adults resembling the Spinal Paralysis of Children.” He gives the case of a man, set. 35, previously healthy, who while suffering from diarrhoea caught a severe cold.

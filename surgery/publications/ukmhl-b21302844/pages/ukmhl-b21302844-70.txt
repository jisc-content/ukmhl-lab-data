The bronchial secretion plays an important part in the spitting (“ sputation”) of hydrophobic patients, and the principal symptoms may be referred to the function of respiration.

Binz (‘Practitioner,’ 1874, April, 269) recalls attention to the case of Plelmholtz (abstracted in this Report, 1869-70, 51), and his suc- cessful treatment of hay fever, by injecting a solution of quiuine. Prickbofer has communicated a case of a similar kind (‘ Yirch. Arch.,’ Ii, 176). Busch has succeeded in two cases with the same drug; a third patient was obliged to abstain from the use of quinine, as it pro- duced unbearable irritation of the nerves of the nose. Helmholtz told Binz in 1872 that his fever was quite cured, and that two other per- sons to whom he had advised this mode of treatment had used it with success. E. Decaisne (“De l’asthme d’ete oufievre de foin,” ‘ Compt. Eend.,’ lxxvii, 536) would strike hay fever out of the nosological catalogue, lie bolds that the affection attacks indifferently those who are and who are not exposed to hay and other dried plants, these having only an indirect influence, marked especially in patients affected with em- physema. The symptoms may appear at any season of the year, and do not present a periodic type. The dyspnoea occurring in the dis- order is only due to an extension of irritation of the conjunctival, nasal, and pharyngeal mucous membranes, such as is common in influenza. His conclusions are based on fifty-one cases, observed in the course of eight years. p T-T TUaeMev, ‘ Experimental Researches on the Causes and Nature of Catarrhus iEstivus (Hay-fever or Hay Asthma),’ Loud., ,873,.

1Jb REPOUT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. logical observations with regard to lupus, as it occurred in fifteen cases, in some there was an infiltration of small cells in the corium and sub- cutaneous tissue, in most cases surrounding the vessels, and in several appearing as large collections of cells containing vessels; in two numer- ous reticulated tubercles were present; in one the cutis had been trans- formed into a cytogenous tissue ; in two the sebaceous and sweat-glands w ere filled with collections of epithelium ; and three preparations had the character of epithelial carcinoma. He thinks that while lupus con- sists essentially in a group of clinical symptoms due to irritation of the cutis leading to proliferation of its cellular elements, it cannot histo- logically or pathologically be strictly divided off from tuberculosis of the skin, adenoma of the sebaceous and sweat-glands, or carcinoma. P. Baumgarten (ib., 484) describes the existence of large, uneven tubercles, covered with thickened epithelium, corresponding to one end of the same metacarpal bone in the hands of a man who died of general tuberculosis. They had beenpresent for two years before death, and had been taken for papillomata, but in their bases true reticulated tubercle was found. The tuberculosis was not complicated by any ulceration or cheesy degeneration. Friedlander, “ Untersucliungen iiber Lupus,” ‘Virch. Arcli.,5 lx, 15.

At this time knots of lepra begau to show themselves on the cheeks. At the age of 28 his whole body was covered with patches and knots, and two years later be had albuminuria and died. The post-mortem examination showed two ulcerated knots at the entrance of larynx, advanced granular disease of the kidney, and lardaceous degeneration of the liver.

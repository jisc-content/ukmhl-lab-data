Huppert (“Heine Motilitatsneurose des Herzens,” ‘Berl. Klin. Woch.,’ 1874, 221) records the case of a lunatic, aged 40, in whom paroxysmal attacks ot increased heart action were succeeded by very peculiar phenomena. The attack came on suddenly, the heart-beats rose to 204—208 in the minute, the heart was apparently enlarged in every way, its action strong, and its sounds clear and powerful. While the jugular veins were swollen and undulating, the radial pulse could not be felt; only a continuous slow moving onwards of the blood ; and the number of heart beats could be counted only by auscultation of the heart itself. The respirations were only slightly increased, there was some bronchial catarrh, and at the commencement the temperature was very slightly if at all elevated, though later it rose 1—20 C. During the paroxysm the spleen and liver were swollen, the stools were relaxed, and the urine, which before was normal, contained albumen, hyaline casts, and blood-cells. The patient complained of no particular pain, certainly nothing resembling angina pectoris. The paroxysm ceased as suddenly as it had commenced, spontaneously, or after the exhi- bition of infusion of digitalis. All the symptoms disappeared in a more or less short time after the return of the pulse to its normal condition (60—70). Huppert looks upon the cause of these attacks as due to disordered innervation, especially of the pneumogastric nerve, the whole train of symptoms being extremely like those resulting from section of that nerve. E. Metschnikoff and J. Setschenow give (‘ Centralbl.,’ 1873, 163) the results of their experiments on the tortoise as to the action of the pneumogastric on the heart, and the latter writer publishes (ib., 289) further observations on the heart of the frog. The conclusions at which they arrive are purely provisional. Gr. G-iannuzzi is also reported (ib., 821) as adding a contribution to our knowledge of the motor nerves of the heart. v.

The principal works that have appeared in Anatomy have been new editions of Quain and Sharpey, Gray, Ellis, and Heath. Sappey’s ‘ Traite d’Anatomie,’ a very fine treatise, has nearly approached com- pletion. Henle’s equally valuable ‘ Handbuch der Anatomie ’ has ended with a volume on the nervous system. In Physiology, Nichols, Hinton, Cleland, and Poster, have all published small works in English, whilst in Prencli or German have appeared Kuss and Duval, Budge and Wundt, and an important series of lectures by Briicke, with new editions of the works of Dalton, Her- mann, and Ranke. Colin has published two handsome volumes on £ Comparative Physiology,’ and Pleming a good translation of Chauveau’s ‘ Comparative Anatomy.’ Milne-Edwards has completed the tenth volume of his valuable ‘ Lecons sur la Physiologie et 1’Anatomie Comparee.’ In Histology the two chief works have been ‘ The Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory,” by Sanderson, Klein, Brunton, and Poster, and the excellent translation of ‘ Prey’s Histology ’ by Mr. Barker.

169 AFFECTIONS OF (ESOPHAGUS AND STOMACH. F. E. Schultze (“Ueber die Bildung brennbarer (rase im Magen,” ‘ Berl. Klin. Wocb.,’ 1874, 317) founds his paper on several cases, occur- ring under Friedreich’s observation in 1865 and later years, of dilatation of the stomach due to pyloric contraction, and accompanied by the giving off, by the mouth, of inflammable gases. His analysis agrees with that of Popoff in the presence of carbonic; acid (C02) and hydrogen in almost equal proportions, due, probably, to butyric acid fermentation in the stomach. In another paper (ib., 336) he gives a case, occurring also among Friedreich’s patients in the summer of 1874, in which, though no inflammable gas was found to be eructated during life, it did escape from punctures, post mortem, in the stomach, duodenum, and upper portions of the small intestine ; while, on the other hand, the gas set free from the ileum and colon extinguished the light presented to it. A. Feroci’s observations (“ Storia di una gastrite terminata per gan- grena, seguita da osservazioni intorno al modo occulto di procedere di alcune Malattie,” ‘Ann. TTniv.,’ ccxxiii, 449) are based upon the case of a woman, set. 48, who had suffered for 18 years with pains, of frequent recurrence, in the abdomen, and especially in the epigastrium, accom- panied by vomiting and diarrhoea. In the October of 1872 the sym- ptoms increased in severity, and oedema and ascites set in, followed in March of the next year by death. The post-mortem examination showed the stomach bound down by strong adhesions and extensive hyper- trophy of its muscular tissue with colloid degeneration (colloid cancer). The writer thinks the hypertrophy was due to the peritoneal adhesions which tied down and hindered the movements of the stomach. A. Dmietrewski gives (‘ Centralblt.,’ 1874, $15) a minute account of the microscopic and other changes he found in the organs of a man, set. 36, who died of leuchsemia. In addition to hyperplasia of the bone marrow, especially marked in the short and flat bones, and leuchtemic new growths in the lungs, kidneys, and liver, he noticed extensive amy- loid infiltration in the spleen, liver, kidneys, intestines, and in the mucous membrane of the stomach. He thinks the amyloid degenera- tion occurring in the latter is extremely rare, and is able to refer to only one other recorded instance (W. Fox, ‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ xli, 388).

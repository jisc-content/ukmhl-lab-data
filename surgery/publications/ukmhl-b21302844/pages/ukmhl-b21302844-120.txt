The treatment required is obviously that which is fitted for people of unsound mind. The patients should be fed at regular intervals, and surrounded by persons who would have moral control over them. He has seen one instance, at least, of a fatal termination to this malady. Charcot and Grehant give (‘ Gaz. Med.,’ 1873, 9) the case of an hysterical woman, set. 43, in whom inability to pass urine, followed by gradual suppression of that secretion, was succeeded by vomiting. The vomit was examined, and found to contain urea in abundance. They conclude that the elimination of urea by the stomach was sufficient to prevent any accumulation of that substance in the blood. Eernet (“He TOligurie et de l’Anurie hysteriques et des vomisse- ments qui les accompagnent,” ‘ Union Med.,’ xv, 566) writes on the same subject, giving a similar case in a girl, set. 19, in addition to the history of Charcot’s and Grehant’s case. He holds that hysterical oliguria demands a separate place among other forms of hysteria, and that it is characterised by a diminution in, or even temporary suppression of, the secretion or excretion of urine, and, secondarily, by the presence of vomited matter in which urea is contained.

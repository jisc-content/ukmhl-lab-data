42 REPORT ON PHYSIOLOGY. 5 :I3> whilst the cavity is of equal dimension, it follows that the daily work of the right ventricle is 34’502 tons, or the total daily work ol both ventricles is equal to 124^208 foot-tons. As the mean weight of the heart is 9’39 oz., the work done by it in foot-pounds per I24’2o8 X 22’40 ounce per minute = ^ x 24 x 60 = 2°'57^’ which considerably ex- ceeds the work done by muscles in a boat. It could raise its own weight 20,000 feet in an hour. M. A. Lecomte1 contests the accuracy of the statement generally made and fully expressed by Cruveilheir, that in rotation of the hand the radius rotates around the stationary ulna. He maintains, on the contrary, that both bones participate in the movement in an equal and harmonious manner, the play of movement in both the upper and lower articulations being very complicated. The movement is effected by four muscles, two pronators and two supinators. The radial pronator is the pronator teres; the radial supinator is the supinator brevis; the cubital pronator is the anconeus, and the cubital supinator is the pronator quadratus. The axis round which the rotation takes place is by no means always that passing through the centre of the middle finger, since this may be displaced either inwards or outwards. See also Mach.3 Dr. Crum Brown 8 discusses the subject of the sense of rotation, which he regards as a distinct sense, and that its perceptions are ob- tained from the ampullae of the semicircular canals.

The first-named experimenter shows that bacteria can be developed with certainty from a solution containing 500 ccm. of water, 1 gramme of potassic nitrate, 1 gramme of magnesium sulphate, with o'2 gramme of neutral calcium phosphate. To 100 ccm. of this solution are added 2 grammes of glucose, o-2 of soluble amylum, o-3 of peptone, and o-o3—o’i of calcium carbonate. The complex solution is placed in a little cell, boiled for ten minutes, and the mouth closed with a hot plate of porous earthenware. After three days’ exposure at a tempera- ture of ioo° the fluid will be found filled with bacteria. Huizinga agrees with Cohn in thinking that ten minutes’ exposure to a boiling temperature is sufficient to kill bacteria, any movements they may after- wards exhibit belonging to the class of molecular and not of vital motion.

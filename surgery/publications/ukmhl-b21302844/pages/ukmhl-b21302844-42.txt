32 REPORT ON PHYSIOLOGY. sponding with the habits of the animal are to he found in the differen- tiation of the centres. Thus, the centres for the tail in dogs, the paw in cats, and the lips and mouth in rabbits, are highly differentiated and pronounced. The action of the hemisphere is in general crossed, but certain movements of the mouth, tongue, and neck, are bilaterally co-ordinated from each cerebral hemisphere. The corpora striata are centres for the muscles of the opposite side of the body. Powerful irritation of one causes rigid pleurosthotonos, the flexors predominating over the extensors ; the optic thalamus, fornix, hippocampus major, and convolutions grouped around it, have no motor signification, being probably connected with sensation. The optic lobes or corpora quadri- gemina, besides being concerned with vision and the movements of the iris, are centres for the extensor muscles of the head, trunk, and legs. Irritation of these centres causes rigid opisthotonos and trismus. The cerebellum is the co-ordinating centre for the muscles of the eyeball. Each separate lobule (in rabbits) is a distinct centre for special altera- tion of the optic axes. On this integrity of their centres depends the maintenance of the equilibrium of the body. The evidence pointing to localisation of centres in the convolutions of the brain obtained from pathology is discussed by Hughlings-Jackson in the same journal as. that in which Eerrier published his experiments.1 Turner3 gives an accurate drawing of the relation of the cerebral convolutions to the outside surface of the skulls. See also Betz 3 and Exner.1 Nothnagel,5 from numerous experiments upon rabbits, finds that the thalami optici have nothing to do with the innervation of voluntary movements. No alteration in the sensibility of the skin can be shown to result from their extirpation. But they do appear to stand in direct relation to the muscular sense. 0. GolgiG describes the structure of the cerebellum. The structure and relation to the nerves of the tactile hairs of various mammals have been studied by various writers, as by Schobl,7 Stieda,8 Dietl,9 Sertoli,10 Paladino and Lanzilotti-Buonsanti,11 Red- tel,12 and Jobert.13 Krause11 andRauber15 have described the termination of the sensory nerves in the synovial membranes of the joints of the fingers in man. 1 ‘West Hiding Lunatic Asylum Reports,’ 1873, pp. 175-195- 2 ‘ Journal of Anatomy and Phys.,’ 1874, p. 359. 2 ‘ Centralblatt f. d.

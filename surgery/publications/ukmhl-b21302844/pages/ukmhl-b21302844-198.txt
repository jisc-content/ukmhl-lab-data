Petrowsky (‘ Centralbl.,’ 1873, 401) refers to the occurrence of white lines on the skin (rayure blanche) noticed by Bouchut in scarlet fever (‘ Traite pratique des Maladies des Nouveau-nes,’ 3th edit., 748) and by Baumler in other diseases (see this Report, p. 49). He holds that the same phenomenon may be made to show itself in perfectly healthy skin by scratching it gently with the point of a glass rod or the finger-nail. Its absence, on the other hand, is due to an abnormal condition of the skin; for instance, it does not occur after making the skin red by rubbing. With other writers he thinks the phenomenon is caused by contraction of the cutaneous arteries, while its absence is due to their paralysis. C. J. Eberth finds (ib., 307) in ordinary and yellow sweat small oval bacteria frequently connected in strings of two or three and showing active movements. In hairy spots they are found attached to the hairs, often in thick layers. They also penetrate into the interior of the hair, causing it to split up and break. Colouring with haematoxylin brings out, not only the colonies seated on the hairs, but also separate bacteria. He promises to inquire further into the question whether these organisms have anything to do with certain chemical changes in the sweat. Ratliery writes (‘Union Med.,’ xvii, 326) on the differential diagnosis of eruptions due to arsenic and syphilis. With certain brownish discolorations and pustules—so-called “ arsenic chancres ”—said to resemble true syphilitic chancres, the writer fails, as might be ex- pected, to find any specific induration or secondary glandular enlarge- ments. Artificial flower-makers, hat-makers, and ladies who use arsenic powder among the other articles of their toilet, are common subjects of these eruptions. Neumann (‘ Wien, Med. Woch.,’ 1873, No. 49) has noticed the occur-

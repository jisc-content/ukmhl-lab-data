CHOLERA. 69 following writers:—E. Besnier read a paper (‘Union Mod.,’ xvi, 417) before the Soc. Med. des Hdpitaux on its occurrence in Paris. There had been some sporadic cases about the end of August, but the disease became epidemic about the beginning of September ; on the 4th October there were 6 fatal cases, next day 29, and during the next week a rise to 38 on the nth; on the 19th the mortality had sunk to 13, and up to the end of the epidemic, at the beginning of November, varied from 4 to 15, the whole number dying being 846, most, as usual, in the worst quarters of the town. In the better quarters the cases were sporadic ; before the epidemic broke out there had been frequent cases of diarrhoea. The writer adds some notes of Leudet’s on the outbreak of cholera in Bouen in 1849 and 1866. The feeling of the writer himself, and of those who took part in the discussion which followed (‘ Graz, des Hop.,’ 1873, 900, &c.) his paper, was in favour of the establishment of separate wards, or, better still, separate cholera hospitals for patients suffering either from this affection or from cholerine. Lecadre (‘ Bull, de l’Acad. de Med.,’1873,1043) andLutaud (‘Graz. Hebd.,’i873,569) give accounts of the smaller outbreaks in Havre and Bouen. The former writer thinks that it was not introduced, but broke out in Havre spontaneously ; and in spite of the fact that during the month of August 91 persons between the ages of 5 and 90 years died there of it, Briquet (‘ Bull, de l’Acad. de Med.,’1873,1047) looks upon the disease as not Cholera Asiatica, but a simple cholera of the country. In both Havre and Bouen the epidemic seems to have ceased about the middle of September. E. M. Balestreri (‘Anna! Univ.,’ ccxxvi, 331) describes the outbreak at Genoa from August to the middle of October. During the first month 42 cases occurred, with 32 deaths ; for the next month there were about 13 cases daily. G-. Lubelski writes (‘Graz. Hebd.,’ 1873, 638) on the epidemic of cholera in Warsaw in 1873. It seems to have been introduced from Galicia on the woodrafts. Prom May to the end of September, during which months it raged, about 2000 persons in Warsaw alone, and from 12,000 to 15,000 in the whole country, died of it, the greatest fatality being among the Jews and the population of ill-drained and unhealthy places. He found sulphate of iron of more use as a disin- fectant than carbolic acid. Erom official papers it appears (‘Wien. Med. Ztng.,’ 1873, 600) that between, March and November, 1873, 4348 persons (1931 males, 1682 females, and. 735 children) were attacked in Pesth, of whom 2189 (938 males, 799 females, and 452 children) died, the majority being among the lowest classes of the population. Damaschino (“ De la diarrhee ditepremonitoire du Cholera,” ‘Union Med.,’ xv, 648) observed the absence of a prodromal diarrhoea in 39 out of 113 cases. In 22 cases it lasted from one to six hours; in 9, twelve hours ; and in the rest, 13 hours or more. In the cases in which the disease set in suddenly, without any diarrhoea, the percentage of fatal cases was 3 2'9. £ Brochm (“ Becherches sur la diarrhee prodromique du Cholera ” Gaz. des Hop.,’ 1873, 881) found that prodromal diarrhoea occurred m the epidemic of 1849 ia 8.5 out of 122 cases, and in that of 1853-^4 in

The first uniform and complete record of these particulars was made on the 4th August, 1873 the establishment having been m working order about eleven weeks the last was made on the 20th April, 1874. I quote only a part of them. Bow Branch Ophthalmic School. Total number of children under care. 1873. August 4 1874. January 5 260 230 Quite free from discharge.

A large number of relapses took place, of which the following numbers give an imperfect record: 1874.

Treatment was now resumed and kept up till the end. 4 8 6 The slight falling off in March and April as compared with the very rapid improvement between January and February was due to the east winds and rapid changes of weather at about that time. It should he added that the character of the cases marked ‘ worst ’ was as a whole milder towards the end of the term than at the earlier dates in 1873. Almost all the ‘worst’ cases on 20th April were extremely chronic and rebellious to treatment. 1874.

I shall, perhaps, not be passing beyond the limits of my subject in giving a short additional statement of my view of the matter, with the intention of reconciling certain apparently conflicting facts. The Bow Branch School was eminently successful in proving that Mr. Critchett’s suggestion was a practicable one, and that a large number of children suffering from such a degree of ophthalmia as to need isolation, and in most cases local medical treatment, can by such treat- ment, combined with dietetic and other hygienic improvements, be kept as a rule practically well, and able to go through very nearly the same amount and kind ef education as healthy children. It also had the positive result of keeping up to a large extent the normal educational course of a number of children, who but for this plan would have been subject to the usual infirmary life of these schools with its many evils.

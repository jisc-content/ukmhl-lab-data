S., vii, 1) on “Pulse Dicrotism,” and puts forward as his own theory that “ dicrotism occurring in any part or segment of an artery is produced in that very segment itself, or, indeed, in a sense by that very segment, as an after- effect of the passage through it of the primary pulse wave. It acts, not in the direction of the axis of the vessel, but transversely to that axis.” He thinks that experiment has shown him that, c&teris ‘pari- bus, the more smartly, as distinguished from powerfully, the heart- stroke is delivered at any segment of a vessel the greater is the ten- dency to dicrotism, and thus in febrile and analogous conditions this smartness of stroke goes hand in hand with lowness of tension in the arterial system, both of them conditions favourable to dicrotism.

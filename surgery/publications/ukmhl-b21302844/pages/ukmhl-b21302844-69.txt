The facts have to be hunted through indignant effusions against the jury who were empanelled on the case, and others. The writer found granular degenerations of the cortical substance of the brain, of the nuclei of the pneumogastric, hypoglossal, and spinal accessory nerves; extravasation of blood in the medulla oblongata, granular and fatty degeneration of the grey substance of the spinal cord in its upper part, which was alone examined, and of the nerve- roots, together with nuclear proliferation of the neuroglia cells of the white substance. The article, which is polemic throughout, is illus- trated by woodcuts of the microscopical appearances found. Fereol read a paper (‘ Graz, des Hop.,’ 1874, 677) before the Paris Academy of Medicine, on a case of hydrophobia occurring in a man two years and a half after the bite of a mad dog, and fatal in three days. He was, up to the time of the attack, in good health, not given to drink, and did not present any symptoms of mental disease ; he had suffered from lowness of spirits for a few days before the rabies showed itself. “ The autopsy showed the usual lesions.” The author con- cludes his paper with the following propositions :—(1.) The period of incubation is generally two months, but may, in exceptional cases, last longer. (2.) The symptoms of the disease may assume varying aspects under the influence of drink, insanity, hysteria, &c. But the respira- tory spasm, the peculiar mode of getting rid of the mucus secreted the symptoms described under the name “aerophobia,” belong to rabies, and are sure diagnostic signs of its existence, in the presence of

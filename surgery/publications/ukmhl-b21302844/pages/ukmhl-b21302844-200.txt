Woch.,’ 1874, No. 25), under the name of Zoster cervico-braehialis gangrsenosus, a peculiar form of the affection, which differs in many points from cases already recorded. The patient was a woman, set. 42, who presented large and small groups of vesicles, and in other parts green and black scabs, some round, some in streaks. The peculiarity of the grouping, exactly similar to that of herpes circinatus, consisted in the fact that rings of new vesicles rose along the borders of the dry and scabbed portions till the eruption grew from the size of a kreuzer to that of a thaler (about the size of a farthing to that of a half-crown-piece—Hep.) It spread continuously from the fingers and back of the hand, extending in three days to the shoulder and mammary region of one side, and passing the middle line to the other side of the body. A. Lagout (‘Union Med.,’ xvii, 310) concludes from his observa- tions of an epidemic of herpes labialis in 1864, supported by later ex- perience, that the affection is not a complication of other diseases, but a malady sin generis, to be classed among the eruptive fevers, differing from them only in its absence of contagion and capability of recurrence. Its extension to the larynx and the lungs is described under the names “herpetic angina” and “herpetic pneumonia.” The appearance of herpes labialis is a favourable symptom in the prognosis of pneumonia.

Kinderheilk.,’ vi, 412) reports the occurrence of eioht cases of Pemphigus neonatorum in three months. All the mothers were attended by the same midwife, and he concludes that, as there were no other cases in Wiesbaden during that time, the contagion was caused by the midwife’s hands. _ ITorand (‘Ann.de Derm.,’ iv, 401) gives two cases of acute febrile pemphigus, occurring in a boy, set. 17, who died, and a girl, set. 14, who recovered. Almost the whole body, in both patients, was covered

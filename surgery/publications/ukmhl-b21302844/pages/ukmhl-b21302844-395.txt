GYNECOLOGY, EHBEACING THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OE THE NON-PEEGNANT STATE. Anomalies of Structure. J. Nicolaysen reports the following case of hmmatometra depending upon a double uterus, one of the cavities not communicating with the vagina (‘ Nord. Med. Ark.,’ t, vi, ist partie). A patient aged 21 had suffered for three years from pain in the right side of the hypogastrium, especially at the period ; she was regular, though a little too profuse. Eor the same time she had noticed a swelling on the right side of the hypogastrium; this was slowly increasing. On examination an elastic movable tumour, three to four inches long and one broad, was found in the right iliac region ; lower down and more to the middle line another tumour filling the pelvis and rising half an inch above the symphysis. This was firmer, but less movable; both were painful on pressure. On vaginal examination, no trace of the vaginal portion of the uterus could be detected. A tumour of the ovary adherent to Douglas’ pouch, and pushing the uterus backwards, was diagnosed. A puncture was made with the aspirator into the most prominent part of the swelling, through the vagina, a small quantity of thick brown fluid was drawn off. Eour days after the operation peritonitis set in and the patient died on the ninth day. At the autopsy the uterus was found quite divided into two, each half corresponded with a Eallopian tube and an ovary, but the right cavity was not in communication with the vagina ; owing to this it had retained the menstrual blood and become distended. There were also found abcesses in ihe left kidney, which was enlarged; the right kidney was absent, the supra-renal capsules were properly developed on the two sides. 25

CLASSED AS A SCIENCE. XID when applied to the mathematics. Whatever may be the impression which external objects make on the mind by simple perception, the only scientific intelligence that can be received of them must be derived from a procedure intimately connected with the mind itself. It is only in the laboratory of mental operations that absolute and necessary truths can be produced. It is on account of this fact not being clearly understood, that men, and more especially medical men, have been wrongly led to imagine that investigations carried on upon the mere principle of their perceptions of external objects, could educe those conditions that are re- quired to form a science. No one can be ignorant that however perfectly a straight line may be drawn on paper, when it is placed in the field of a microscope, it no longer appears to be a clean, even, line, as it did before ; but it is now represented as not only having a degree of breadth before unnoticed, but that this breadth is of different thickness in different parts, and also that it no longer appears accurately straight. Such a line viewed by a geometrician excites no other idea in him than in others unac- quainted with geometry, as long as it is seen alone. But if another line, equally awkward, be placed in juxtaposition, either parallel, obliquely to it, or across it, then the geometrician catches all the relations which these lines have with each other.

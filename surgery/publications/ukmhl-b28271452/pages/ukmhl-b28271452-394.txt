SURGICAL PRACTICE. 340 commenced the use of mercury by inunction; and as soon as the mouth became in the slightest way affected, the pain diminished and the black mass more completely separated, which was of consider- able substance; by the continuance of this plan the sore asssumed a healthy aspect, and readiness to heal. This case has convinced me that the venereal poison has the power of producing death of a part even without adventitious circumstances to favour such a condition of things, for the patient was a quiet discreet gentleman, using every caution from the moment he had placed himself in a situation that might lead him to fear that he had been in- fected. In this case the absorbent glands were not the least affected. The essential condition of a chancre consisting so much in the hardness which is established, it is not enough to have the influence of the medicine carried only so far as to see the viscid discharge removed from the surface, and the sore assume the fine vermilion red colour which the influence of mercury produces, and to think that now the patient has done enough, for even in this healing state the sore has the power of communicating the disease. But it must be impressed upon the mind of the patient that the treatment is only to be. considered at an end when all hardness has disap- peared. A_nd moreover, it is not to be supposed, because a chancre may become an irritable sore, and the part on which the sore is seated may have sloughed and destroyed in this way the chancre, that, therefore, a patient is secured from the train of secondary symptoms.

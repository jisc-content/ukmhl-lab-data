The senses, however assisted by the ingenuity and im- provement of art, cannot be made to atford to the mind that perfect intelligence w^hich is the neces- sary condition for the discovery of truth. The use of the microscope affords little for the improvement of science until it begins to lay open to the mind re- lations before unknown. In the investigation into the quality of science, we must look up to some higher condition of the mind than that which may be produced by the perception of external bodies. This is the light in which the expression, intellectual science, is expected to be viewed, more particulaily

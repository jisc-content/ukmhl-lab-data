SURGICAL PRACTICE. 173 prolapse of the membrane. But however small they may be, they offer an obstacle to the easy passage of the dejection, Avhich serves to push them outwards, and to help to force the whole part down. This being a state of things of infinite annoyance, and even of injury to the health, pa- tients are induced to submit to operations. I am aware that piles are often not merely distended veins; for I have seen them with an artery in- cluded in the tumour, that has pulsated very strongly, even as much so as the radial artery at the wrist. Surgeons have, for the most part, been deterred, on account of the bleeding that has often followed, from cutting them off. But it must be remembered, that if there be any coagulumleft in the tumour after the incision, it will go on bleeding: and I believe that very generally this is the way by which the bleeding is kept up after the pile has been excised, which may have given rise to the great apprehen- sion of hemorrhage in these operations. I have, with few exceptions, adopted the operation of ex- cising internal piles, and with the precaution and the use of an expedient I have noAv to mention, I have never been troubled with any serious extent of bleed- ing. This remedy is simply a solution of sulphate of iron in water; a grain to an ounce seems quite strong enough. If this be injected in small quantity, so that it may be retained after the operation, I be- lieve it will hardly ever fail of preventing bleed- ing. I consider the advantages of excision over tying to be, that the operation is completed at one suffering, and is almost instantaneously executed.

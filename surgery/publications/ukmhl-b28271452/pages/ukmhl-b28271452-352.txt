SURGICAL RRACTICE. 298 inasmucli as, instead of two diseased parts being in a situation to press and rub on each other, the acetabulum is now relieved of all pressure, and the diseased head of the femur is now made to repose in a bed of healthy structure. Thus the parts of the joint are placed in the best condition for allow- ing the powers of reparation to go on, and conse- quently for bringing the whole system into a state of tranquillity. We daily see individuals who have escaped the more destructive consequences of this disease, and who move about on irons, fully capable of enjoying exercise. It seems surprising that some surgeons should have shown great anxiety, and taxed their inge- nuity to find means of retaining the head of the bone in the acetabulum, when the disease of the hip has advanced to this point; thus inflicting great suffering by forcing two diseased surfaces in col- lision with each other. In the hip disease much has been said respect- ing the shortening of the limb. I have repeatedly measured the length of the limb in this disease with the greatest accuracy such a proceeding will admit of, and have not detected this supposed shortening, nor indeed any thing like lengthening, except when the disease is going through those stages which termi- nate in displacement of the head of the femur, when indeed the limb altogether assumes a new arrange- ment of position, which excludes almost the possi- bility of making a measurement. But there is a shortening of the limb not arising from the disease of the joint, although sometimes following it. As

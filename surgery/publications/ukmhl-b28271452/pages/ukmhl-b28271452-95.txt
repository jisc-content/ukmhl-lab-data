41 SURGICAL PRACTICE. it. Tlie bone is to be draAvn a little backwards, and then the end is to be pressed over the surface of the upper bone, when it will resume its proper place. In each of these ways, by which the dis- location is produced, the same state of things exists ; so that, by making mere extension in the axis of the bone luxated, the power employed is chiefly expended in clasping the two bones together, which may be felt by the operator, if he attends to the sensation he receives in the operation. (See Jig. 2.) Luxations of the clavicles are nearly equal in number at each end of the bone. These are cases in which muscles have much to do in the treat- ment ; and this consists in placing the parts in such a position, that the muscles concerned may be sustained in their ordinary state of association, and in which they are best disposed to repose in quietude. My practice is to avoid all bandages, which, by constraining muscles, only excite them to undue action. All I do is, to place the patient on his back on a flat bed, and the bones imme- diately recede into their proper position, and unin- terruptedly are kept so. By keeping the patient thus placed, he in a short time gets well. The arms should be kept as quiet as possible. The dis- placement at the acronial end is less than that at the other when luxated, because it is retained nearly in its place by the trapezoid and conoid ligaments. This case requires less attention and time than that of the sternal end, where much more quietude, and of a longer duration, is neces- sary. The principle upon which this method is

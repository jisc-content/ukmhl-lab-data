SURGICAL PRACTICE. 189 urine in its discharge is continually acting upon the stricture itself, as an excitement which adds to the irritation of it, and therefore really promotes its increase. The force of the fluid also is continually exercising an unnatural pressure upon the walls of the tube behind the stricture. From the know- ledge we have of the force this impelling power can produce, we might suspect that the effects it can occasion would be both greater and more common than we find is the case. The injuries resulting from it are of two kinds : it causes the tube to give Avay in the form of a very small ulcer, and probably the aperture is so minute that it only alloAvs one drop of urine to escape at the time the fluid is flowing through the membranous portion of the canal. This small quantity passing into the adjoining structure is of such an irritating quality that it excites the parts to deposit lymph, and thus a wall is formed about the tube, and the structures are preserved from the destructive influence of a complete effusion, the continued irritation of the contained fluid brings on the suppu- rative process, and a small abscess is formed, which, although it only presents itself as a hard tumour in the perineum, must be vicAved as more than a mere induration of the part, for it is indeed the first stage of a fistula in perineo. The patient flncls that he has more than usual difficulty in passing his urine, but that he has not so much pain at the time he is relieving himself, as a fcAV minutes after he has finished. Each time of micturition a drop of urine escapes through the aperture in the membrane, Avhich

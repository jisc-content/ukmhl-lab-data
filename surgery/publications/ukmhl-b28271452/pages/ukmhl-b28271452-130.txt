SURGICAL PRACTICE. 76 of manipulating here, is to place the patient on his affected side, with the limb bent, and then to rotate gently the tibia on its axis. In this po- sition tlie joint is loose, maldng no pressure on the cartilage, and it has the best chance of quietly slipping into its place. I have often known in this luxation, when left alone, that whilst the patient was asleep the cartilage has slipped into its place, after a few days. A medical gentleman in the country came to me not long since, to confer with me about a case of this sort in a patient of his, a miller. He had tried every expedient in vain. I assured him he might make his mind easy, and go back and try to keep the miller in bed, and it would slip into its place while the man was asleep. He very soon wrote to me word, that, to his joy, it happened as I had predicted, even though he could not prevent the miller going into his mill. I have seen great violence used in efforts to reduce the cartilage to its place, but all to no jiurpose. If the gentle rotatory motion does not succeed, the only thing is to keep the patient in bed, and in some of his slumbers all will come right. Of course, if this accident has once occurred, it will be liable to happen often. I design now to make one or two observations before I proceed to those injuries of the leg in which the muscles are interested. In calculating that position which may seem most adapted to place the limb in repose, it is necessary to regard the liabits of the individual in reference to the degree of use with which in one direction or in another he

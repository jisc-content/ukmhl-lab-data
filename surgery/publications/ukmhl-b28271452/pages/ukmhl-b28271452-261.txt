SURGICAL PRACTICE. 207 bladder, I have very commonly found that I have pushed back the stone which has been wholly or in part lodged in the urethra. We find that children sutFer very differently who have calculi impacted in the urethra. Its mechanical form will cause this variety; if it is sharp-pointed, it gives great pain and excites irritation beyond the stimulus of relief; it disturbs the part and diminishes the chance of its removal; but if it be smooth it only excites so much action as to call upon the powers of relief, and this Avill gradually advance it in a way to be expelled. If there be no difficulty in passing the water, and the pain be little, the best course to adopt is, I think, to leave it to the probable efforts of the part to expel it, unless it remains a long time per- sistent in one part, and then to remove it by an incision. When calculi, particularly the small ones, remain deposited in the urethra, by the irritation they produce, they dispose the membrane to contract and form a stricture anterior to the part in which they are lodged. I have observed that in those cases of malform- ation, in which there is an imperfection in the urethra by its terminating short of the proper point in the glans penis, that the part is extremely irritable, and liable to discharges not infectious, and also to the formation of strictures. If gonor- rhea occurs in such a state of things, it is very tardy in disappearing. The cases of stricture with complete obstruction seem to have been far more common formerly than

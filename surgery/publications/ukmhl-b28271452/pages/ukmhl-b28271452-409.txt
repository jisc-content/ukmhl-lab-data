SURGICAL PRACTICE. 355 If proofs are wanting to convince us that carci- noma is not merely a local disease even at the earliest period of its appearance, it must be more readily allowed that the malignant fungus is the manifest- ation of a peculiarly diseased condition of the con- stitution. The constant sequel to a removal of a tumour of this sort, whether in the breast or in an extremity, is the disclosure that some gland that was not discoverable before, quickly becomes affected, and rapidly advances in the same form of disease, or what is even more commonly found to be the case, some of the viscera are invaded in the same way. It seems almost as if the removal of one local part roused the system to exhibit the destructive powers of the disease in other parts. I have generally found that patients with this disease, although they have a coated tongue and a quick pulse, exj)ress themselves as feeling well. I have also noticed that on the removal of a fungous tumour the wound is disposed to heal rapidly, and without going through the free suppurative stage, which in other cases would be expected. In exa- mining bodies after death operated on for this dis- ease in the testis, I have found that large masses of the disease in the lumbar glands have surrounded, but not pressed upon the vena cava, leaving the circulation of the blood in it quite free, and the tube of the vessel appeared to be deposited in a canal, without being at all interfered with by the pressure of the surrounding mass. This is not what we find to be the case in the growth of tumours gene- rally. I witnessed the same state of things in the A A 2

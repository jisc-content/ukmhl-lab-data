SURGICAL PRACTICE. 232 We rarely see of late the large indolent sores which were formerly very common in hospitals. These were not only large in surface, but abounding in a mass of insensible granulations, rising consider- ably above the surface of the adjacent sound parts. This sort of sores appeared to give the patient as little pain as if they did not exist; and the chief annoyance seemed to be, the necessary process of dressing them ; while the disease formed an excuse for idleness, and perhaps indulgence in drinking. I have been disposed to explain this state of leg in the following way. The sore having been treated in a way to promote its healing, while the pa- tient is allowed the free use of the limb, by which the processes for fully healing the ulcer are interrupted, while the continued exercise of the leg having called forth the powers of accommodation, these exercise their influence in depriving the sore of its sensibility, and thus the sore becomes adapted to the original economy of the member, the constitution shoA\dng no disturbance at a new local function being permanently brought into exercise. A very important feature in ulcers of the leg is, that increased injury Avhich attaches to them Avhen they have penetrated so deep as to involve the fascias. This structure is not only never reproduced, Avhen it has been destroyed, but no substitute is formed in its place; so that the inuscles have not that freedom of motion which is produced by the very delicate and extensile tissue Avhich connects them to the fasciae, but they are really tied down to the cicatrix. In consequence of this, Avhen the sore

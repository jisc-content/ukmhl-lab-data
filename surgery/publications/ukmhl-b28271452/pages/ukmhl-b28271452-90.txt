36 SURGICAL PRACTICE. not seem to be cause for exciting any undue action of muscles. The result of the treatment is not to leave any inequality in the union of the parts; and this is an injury that does not deteriorate the arm at all. I have never seen any of that imperfection arise that is commonly alluded to, as causing some unevenness in the way in which the bone unites. All the motions are ultimately restored. The other fracture, which has some- times the term given to it, of fracture of the ole- cranon, is, where the fracture takes place just at the root of the coronoid process. In this case there is very little displacement; both the external lateral ligament and the anconeus muscle being calculated to prevent the parts from separating much. This accident is accompanied with more pain than the other; it also leaves ultimately some imperfection in the joint. It always occurs from some force ap- plied to the part, as far as I have seen, by a sharp body, and I have often found the bone broken, -with a small piece loose, which may account for the imper- fection that has remained. Although the treatment is by keeping the arm extended, I am not fully impressed with the advantage of it over that of simply leaving the arm in a state of quietude, in the bent position. It might be supposed that little new can be offered respecting fractures of the bones of the fore-arm. I have, however, two observations to make; the one is, that I have seen the greatest mischief arise from using bandages in this injury particularly, as, in- deed, on very many other occasions. The broken parts of the two bones having been pressed together,

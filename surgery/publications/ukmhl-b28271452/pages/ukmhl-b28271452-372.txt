318 SURGICAL PRACTICE. a compa,ges of muscular structure, whose action is chiefly employed in keeping up a uniform pressure on the contents of the cavity. But whilst the walls are preserving the cylindrical form of the cavity, the diaphragm is transmitting its powers through the almost semifluid contents of the abdomen. And in the action of this large muscle we possibly may obtain those terms of a problem that shall explain the nature of the formation of hernia. It can hardly be doubted that before hernia is actually formed in persons advanced in life, and where the complaint slowly comes on, there is some change gradually going on by which the internal ring is gradually made to approximate to the ex- ternal. The figure of the diaphragm is that of an arched dome, but having a tendinous expansion in the middle, it is divided into two arches of muscular fibres. Now it is clear that if a muscular fibre take a curved form, every point in the curve will act in the direction of the versed sine to that point, or what comes to the same thing, to the perj^endicular of the tangent of the point. If the curves of the diaphragm were those of a sphere these perpendicu- lars would all concentrate in one point; but this not being the case, the perpendiculars will be directed more copiously on some directions than on others; that is, the action of the muscle will be transmitted with greater force to some parts of the boundaries of the abdomen than to others, and thus determine the seat of hernia. If the chest be narrow the di- rection of the accumulated impulses may fall low, as well as if the distance from the diaphragm to the

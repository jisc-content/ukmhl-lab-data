88 SURGICAL PRACTICE. not to set such a case doAvn as a fracture of the fibula onl}^, as I believe is often done; for other- Avise the injury may leave imperfections Avhich could have been avoided, had a correct view been taken of the case originally. If the tibia be ad- vanced forwards upon the astragalus, eA^en in a very slight degree, it prevents, Avhen the injured foot is behind the other, that free motion of the foot upon the leg, and the formation of an acute angle be- tAveen them, which is so necessary in progression, and thus a hobbling gait is produced. The surgeon should be accustomed to calculate all the bearings of the principal parts of the foot, and to measure distances between them. The conditions of this accident are, that the external malleolus does not lose its connections, the external ligament being entire, but the fibula is broken above; therefore the upper part of this bone advances with the tibia; the internal lateral ligament must give way to alloAv the tibia to come forward. This advance of the leg upon the foot is equal to throwing the axis of motion so far for- ward, that the foot is under a longer lever for the muscles behind to act upon ; and agreeably to the positions laid doAvn, the foot being extended upon the leg, the position in Avhich the gastrocnemius is used to act most powerfully, this muscle exerts all its force to draAV the heel upAvards, and con- tinue the displacement to the utmost. HoAvever well the surgeon may adapt the parts, yet a very slight movement of the patient Avill be enough to displace them; but perseverance Avill fully complete

I may safely say, that for many years that I have followed up these principles, I have never had a case of traumatic gangrene arising from severe injuries that has not stopped. Of all the subjects that come before the surgeon for prompt and decisive conduct, this is, I am convinced, one of the most important. It is an opportunity for science to step in and save life; it is a demonstra- tion of the ability to decide the agitated question of immediate amputation or not. It is the exercise of a convincing practice much beyond any proof derived from arguments. I am convinced that by adopting this course of watching the expressions which the constitution shows during the first three or four days of the first stage of very serious injuries, and by throwing in brandy, when the indications demand it, that there can be no occasion to amputate on account of traumatic gangrene.

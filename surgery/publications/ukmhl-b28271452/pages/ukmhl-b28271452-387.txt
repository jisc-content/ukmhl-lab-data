In the female I have not found that the sore, after the applieation of the acid, has ever j)ut on a chancrous character, or that any symptoms have ultimately appeared that could be referred to such a source. In the sloughing phagedasna the edges, which are everted, turgid, and inflamed to a cer- tain extent, immediately after the ajiplication of the acid, become turned down, smooth, and the inflam- mation of the adjoining parts nearly disajDjiears.

XXXV CLASSED AS A SCIENCE. that, on the score of humanity, it is not creditable to practise the profession uninstructed in this well-known scientific attainment. If surgeons felt fully the desire of throwing a scientific mantle over their profession, they would embrace with avidity every branch of science that could administer to its perfection. Sir John Her- schel has thus expressed himself: — “ Dynamics is placed at the head of all sciences, and, happily for human knowledge, it is one in which the highest certainty is attainable — a certainty in no way inferior to mathematical demonstration.” This philosopher displays, with lively animation, the prospects which mechanics offer of conferring the character of science on chemistry. Surgery may be supposed to be, as a science, buried in the icy fetters of the Arctic pole; and no noontide beam has yet thrown its horizontal ray across this frozen region, to intimate that the night of days, or of weeks, may be at an end. We have brilliant examples of great scientific discoveries made by intellectual minds, when strenuously sustained in carrying on the work. The great astronomer Kepler laboured incessantly for nearly fourteen years before he finally perfected the demonstration of his celebrated theorem, which expounded the laws of gravity in their application to the planetary system, by which astronomy was made a perfect science; the splendid discoveries of Newton con-

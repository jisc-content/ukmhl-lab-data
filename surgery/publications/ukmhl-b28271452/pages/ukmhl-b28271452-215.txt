161 SUEGICAL PEACTICE. and very insensible structure, from which it has acquired the name. As the previous abscess has a tendency to open as well into the rectum as outwardly near the anus, so there is a dilference in the kind of opening it may make. It does not open between these points, as matter will not pierce muscles if it can find any other way to advance. In the rectum the opening is usually small, but the finger can detect it by feeling a small papillary growth pro- jected into the bowel. The other place of opening is in the integuments, just outside the anus, and external to the sphincter; and very often there is besides the opening through the integuments, also an opening at the lower margin of the anus, having nothing to do with the muscle. To explain the necessity of the operation, I shall contrast these two cases. In that where the sphinc- ter hardly seems interested, we find that laying open the external parts is enough, and whatever, influence the constant action of the muscle may have over this wound, it still heals: it is true, this influence is not much. I apprehend that where there is a free exit of matter, and no depth of dis- eased structure, such is the natural endowment of incised skin, that it always is disposed to assume the function of healing over breaches of its struc- ture, and of associating in that office surrounding parts. The division of the integuments is the best excitement to call into action these powers; but in conformity with the indolence of these parts, this influence which the skin possesses does not extend to the deeper structures.

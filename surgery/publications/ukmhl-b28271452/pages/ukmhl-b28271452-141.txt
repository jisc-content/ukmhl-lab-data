SURGICAL PRACTICE. 87 has so far eiven wav as to allow the fibula to be broken without any mark of visible injury to it. But still the real type of these modifications is a very common accident; that in which the foot is turned with its plantar aspect looking outwards, and the fibula broken. But even this complete case may occur without the surgeon being at once aware of its character; the dis- placement is so easily reduced, that this may take place before he is called to the case. The treat- ment is to place the limb in a state in which the muscles generally may be in the greatest repose. We find in this case, that even the advocates for the inclined plane are ready to adopt the side posi- tion. The surgeon will find now the great difference of the state of the gastrocnemius, when the foot is extended, and Avhen it is bent: as he brings the foot from the former state to the latter, he will find this muscle relax to its utmost. By frequent adjustment this injury recovers quite; and we find the patient has the perfect use of the limb in a moderate time. The luxation of the tibia forwards is not an un- usual case : we find the end of the bone is brought in front of the astragalus, and in various degrees of displacement. This dislocation implies a frac- ture of the fibula, somewhat lower down than in the last case, which I have always found to be the case when tlie displacement was consider- able. 1 have said the tibia is advanced forward in various degrees; and therefore, as it is only slightly so on some occasions, it behoves surgeons G 4

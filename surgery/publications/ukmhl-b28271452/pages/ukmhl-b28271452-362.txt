308 SUEGICAL rRACTICE. tlie former ouglit to be broken in tlie least possible degree beyond the outer. I apprehend it is too readily assumed as a fact, that the inner table is ahvays broken to a far greater extent than the outer; but if it is the case, I con- ceive the explanation to be this : the two tables having a given, although minute, space between them, the impetus is broken into two distinct appli- cations. The first blow upon the outer table will necessarily break it to a slightly greater space than the instrument which produces it: after this is effected, then the inner table receives the renewed impetus, which is now imparted to it by the outer table, by which this table, allowing it to have the same frangibility, will be broken to a greater extent than that in which the outer was broken. Amongst the great varieties of wounds of the scalp which occur in hospital practice of the ordi- nary kind, we find very few that are attended by symptoms of concussion. The fact is, that the im- petus of the blow is expended on the mere spot in which the wound of the scalp takes place. We have, in the high state of organization of the scalp, the explanation of the favourable result Avhich usually attends them. It is true that most of these wounds are not large, but then they are contused, and this contusion produces a slight slough of but little appreciable extent, and for the first few days the Avounds are painful, and discharge perhaps much; but by means of the highly organized structure this very slight slough is quickly throAvn off, and Avhen the part is cleared ol it, the granulations

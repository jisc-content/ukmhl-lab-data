91 SURGICAL TRACTICE. injure the os coccygis. If the patient is of ad- vanced age, and the joints anchylosed, the bone is broken. This accident is said to occur more especially in females, because the ischia are mder apart, and thus the tuberosities do not protect this bone. If the tuberosities protect the male because they are nearer, so would they the female if the os coccygis projected no further. In the female, however, it takes a larger sweep, and stands beyond the line of the tuberosities, and thus is more obnoxious to injuries. This is a most painful accident, and the patient sutFers most distressingly whenever the bowels are acting. Quietude, and the gentlest means possible of easing the bowels, seem the only treatment permitted to the surgeon. The period of suffering is shortened by the patient keeping in bed ; when, after a short endurance of the pain, she becomes quite easy and well. I have said much in favour of treating fractures with the least possible restraint and without pressure of muscles; I must therefore set my face against that plan which has been suggested, of applying weights to keep up permanent extension. I have formerly seen this practice much used, and witnessed how fully it kept up constant irritation and action of muscles; causing them to contract, instead of inducing them to relax. The material out of which one part of j)atho- logical science is to be constructed is probably the knowledge of those new functions which living structures can set up under the influence of a power

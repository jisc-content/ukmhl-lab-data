SURGICAL RRACTICE. 61 tlie middle of the shaft. There is the appearance of great advantage in the inclined plane, as it is called, and its use is very commonly adopted. The position on it is liable to disturbance from any for- â– ward movement, as above remarked. The excess of weight of the outer part of the knee and thigh being on the outside the axis of the bone, causes the limb to fall outwards: to meet this derange- ment, the foot is bound to a foot- board; which very confinement excites all the muscles to exert an influence to relieve the irksomeness they are under, and the trunk is by an insensible muscular action imperceptibly brought to the leg, which is confined. Surgeons impute to the inclined plane circum- stances which do not belong to it. It does not entirely support the leg when it rests uj)on it, and this degree of support diminishes as the angle of elevation increases; and further, as the thickness of the calf of the leg prevents the whole of the lower part of the broken thigh resting upon the face of the plane, this part overhangs as a lever, and allows the leg to act as a weight, drawing down the knee and elevating the broken bone at the place where it is fractured. The action of the sartorius, which cannot be prevented in the po- sition on the back, must have also some influence in giving the form which the bone always assumes, when united under this management, of bowing outwards and forwards. By the treatment on the side position, these defects are in a great measure prevented. It is to be observed that to carry out effectually the advantages of this last method, the trochanter major, the external condyle, and the

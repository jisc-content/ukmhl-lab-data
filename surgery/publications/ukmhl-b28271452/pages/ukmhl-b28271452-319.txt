SUEGICAL PEACTICE. 265 are those who are liable to it. Of course rest is, in all of them, indispensable in the treatment. Although the prevalence of scrofula is so great, and the opportunities of observing the phenomena of the disease are so numerous, yet we have no suc- cinct exposition of the conditions under which it exists, or of the laws which regulate its progress ; it can hardly be said to have any laws assigned to its manifestations ; and, indeed, it is sometimes difficult to define in all cases what is scrofula and what is not. It can hardly be disputed that the essential character of its existence is that of an innate condition of the constitution. But we are not to infer from this peculiarity in the constitution, that the scrofulous manifestations will necessarily be made apparent, or that the individual may not pass through life without showing the least sign of the nature of his constitution. The evidence of the state may often depend upon contingencies, which we know to be not unfrequently the case. The absence of manifestation by no means proves that the individual has not the principle of scrofula im- planted in his constitution. A material point of the inquiry into the natural history of scrofula, must be that of estimating the influence of its manifestations on the system. I think the prosecution of such an inquiry will not lead to the conclusion, that this complaint so far encroaches upon the powers that sustain life as in- trinsically to be fatal. We frequently see persons who, when young, had suffered from scrofulous affections, and who, having passed over the impres-

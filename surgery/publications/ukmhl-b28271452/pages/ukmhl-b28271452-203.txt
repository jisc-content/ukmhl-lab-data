SUEGICAL PRACTICE. 149 The strong fascia embracing the muscles of the ^ extremities appears to differ widely in its vital powers from the periosteum. The latter seems to have the power of altering its conditions to a great degree, and in all its states retaining its properties. The fascia has, by far, less vital power, and in any excitement of an active character is readily destroyed. It is a membrane of important use in the muscular economy of a limb. It is, indeed, the integument of the muscles, and if it loses its healthy state, the flexibility and vigour of these moving powers are seriously impaired. It is that medium which is required to preserve structures that are formed for motion from being impeded by all the many in- juries and imperfections that may happen to the integuments. The loss of a small portion of it in the leg leaves an imperfection distressing to the patient, although the accompanying sore on the surface may have healed. The fascia seems to be a structure little capable, when injured, of rising into the process which may be termed the function of repair; this bespeaks the low degree of organisation it possesses. It is on this account, probably, that injuries of it so readily lead to a destructive progress, and therefore require the most delicate management to avert bad consequences. The slightest puncture of this structure will often be followed by inflammation and extensive formations of matter; its construc- tion being to give power to the muscles under it, so an injurious influence is exercised in its in- juries by their action.

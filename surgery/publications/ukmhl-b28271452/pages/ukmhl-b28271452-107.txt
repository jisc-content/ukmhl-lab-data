53 SURGICAL PRACTICE. in restoring' the powers of the limb than the plan usually adopted. The lateral position requires that the thigh should be bent on the trunk, and the leg on the thigh, as this is a position where the muscles are in the quietest state. The position of placing the patient half on the side and half on the back is doing little. The sound hip should be vertically over the injured one. However, the fact is, that the age of the subjects of this accident compels us to adopt the position on the back, and the inclined plane, as it is only in this way the functions of life, in the advanced stages, can be even tolerably well carried on. Moreover, as on the side the whole weight of the body is concentrated on the trochanter major, the chances of sloughing are much greater than when the pressure is spread over the large surface of the back. The cases where the fracture takes place at the root of the trochanter, so that this process is still attached to the shaft of the femur, and the neck remains with the head, are not so common. We have in this case actual crepitus; and in rotating the femur we find it move about its axis only, and not revolve in a circle, as when the neck and head form the radius : the pain is in the part, and not just below the joint, as in the fracture of the neck. Here we have decided shortening, and that occur- ring early. I consider this a case where the treat- ment of placing the patient on the side is the best, as it secures him from the jars and displacements that must occur when he is on his back ; and as the cases are usually in individuals of less advanced

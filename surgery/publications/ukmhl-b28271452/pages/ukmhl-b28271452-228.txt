That the wounds being simple when the membrane is restored to its proper place, there is the better chance of the adhesive process being so far carried out as ultimately to retain the membrane in its place, and prevent the continuation of the pro- trusion, if straining on the parts can be prevented lor three days. Indeed I have seen the prolapse quite cured by the excision. In either case the operation should be restricted to the mere pile, and not include any part of the membrane around it. I have occasionally, at the instance of patients, tied piles, but have found the pain more severe, and the swelling and soreness in the succeeding days after the operation have produced greater suf- fering, and the parts have seemed more readily to be protruded by the dejections than after the excision. Of late I have found such great advantage in employing the sulphate of iron in prolapsed bowel, that the oj^eration may very often be dis- pensed with, and the patient quite cured merely with the use of this remedy. Very lately I had in the hospital two cases of the worst sort, — the one of twenty years’ standing, with a great protrusion and abundance of bleeding piles, who in about three weeks left without any protrusion or bleed- ino-: declaring himself to be in a state of comfort O O that he had not known for so long a time. The other came from one of the institutions that offer great pretensions in the treatment of this class of cases. He was very bad, having both internal and external piles, and the bowel descending largely and most readily: he was completely relieved in about a

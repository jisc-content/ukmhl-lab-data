SURGICAL RRACTICE. 4 or other circumstances, may excite in the senso- rium, must have a centre, around which their exertions are to be employed. Indeed, every movement in the animal body engages a watchful sense for maintaining its equilibrium, as for pro- viding for the requisite precision of action. To preserve this unity of purpose amidst such a complexity of means, there must be a centre of motion, about which all the separate systems are to move. The centre of motion is the centre of gravity. In man the centre of gravity is a movable point, limited in the variation of its position, between the pubis and sacrum. To in- sure perfect uniformity and combination in the agents of motion in the animal body, there must be the fullest and the nicest intercommunication of the nervous influence, requiring much more complication of qualities than those of mere motion or sensation. The surgeon is so often called upon to conduct his treatment of cases in reference to muscular action, that it becomes necessary to dwell longer upon this subject. We see enough, wherever mus- cles are engaged, to know that they are continually varying in their condition as moving powers. We And them in states of transition, either advancing in increase of strength, or receding from their natural standard. They vary and enlarge their associations with other muscles, or they con- tract and simplify their combinations. Thus we find that old associations of muscular actions are continually being broken up, and that new

190 SURGICAL PRACTICE. produces this pain until it is well diluted with the pus. In this way the tumour increases and assumes the unequivocal character of an abscess. As this becomes larger and the quantity of pus greater, the effused urine produces less pain. The wall formed by the deposited lymph, as well as the barrier of the fascia, prevent a rapid increase, and convey the feel- ing to the touch of hardness, so that it is long be- fore anything like fluctuation is felt; and therefore, without waiting, the proper practice is promptly to plunge a scalpel into the tumour, and freely open a way not only to discharge all the fluid, but to prevent the possibility of its accumulating. The surgeon will have to contend with the arguments of the patient to get his permission to adopt this operation, as the latter regards it only as some trifling matter ; but the surgeon foresees the great mischief of delay. In the very beginning of the case the thicken- ing around the urethra is such that its pressure inwards causes an obstacle to the passage of an instrument, and the adopting of such a measure has an injurious tendency, as it only adds to the irritation already commenced, and besides can- not have any effect in diminishing the obstruction.

And when this abscess is opened, and the matter and urine, if any, have a free exit, the whole treatment should be that of soothing the structures. Of course the urethra should not be teazed with the

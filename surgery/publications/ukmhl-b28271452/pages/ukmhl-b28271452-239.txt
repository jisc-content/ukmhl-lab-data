SUllGICAL PRACTICE. 185 portion of the urethra resumed its usual calibre, so as to admit a full-sized catheter, although the stone remained. I have stated these things to show the strong conservative powers that exist in these parts to pre- serve the due ministration of functions. We must recollect that there must be a relation between the muscular coat of the bladder and the state of the urethra, and that a variety in the calibre of the urethra will cause a change in the state of the muscles of the bladder. The asso- ciation of functions moreover produces what most surgeons must have met with, that, CÂ£eteris paribus, an instrument passes easier at the time of a full bladder than when very little water is present. I once was unable to get a catheter into the bladder of a person who had suppression of urine, and there was no state of the parts discovered after death that could account for the difficulty. There was no water in the bladder. We have an accurate arrangement in the urinary organs, and we have also an ample provision by the endowment of adaptations, for the security of the regular exercise of the functions. And some slight infraction of the order of the associated actions is likely to give rise to great derangements. Supposing that the tube through which a fluid is to be forced be divided into two parts of different calibre: in order that the force should only be expended on the fluid, it will be necessary that the velocity of the fluid in the narrow part should move in the proportion to that of the larger

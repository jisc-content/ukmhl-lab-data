SURGICAL PRACTICE. 14 the state of extension of the limb. So we have only to flex the leg a little, and all this powerful opposition to restoring the patella ceases upon using the shghtest rotatory motion, and it readily falls into its place. This law of muscular action explains the great difference we find in the opposition offered to the manipulations we adopt in various disloca- tions. It does not enter into any part of the design of these observations, to discuss a question of nervous functions; but it must be apparent, that if we stop at the point at which it is declared that one set of nerves is appropriated to sensation, and another set to motion, we advance very little to settle many points in pathology. We cannot assign the laws of even one muscle without having some proof that a most intimate association and communication of nervous influence is called for, and to a degree that is beyond all conception in the promptitude and certainty of the power they exert. No part of the animal economy abounds with more evidence of the wonders of adaptation. I feel that it cannot be too much insisted upon, that muscles, the agents of motion, whilst they act under given associations, may even then fluctuate, or pass into transitional states, if not steadily called upon for the same exercise of their functions. They may increase in power, or they may fall off in strength; but if they have lost the association under which they have been accustomed to act, then they readily assume new associations, and combine to execute new actions under the new arrangement;

68 SURGICAL PRACTICE. will the muscles, on their part, yield in obedience to the associations of these functions exercised under the excitement of injury. The power of conservancy is as much called forth to remove all opposition to the completion of the integrity of a system, such as is the joint, as to restore the injury of a mere part. The formation of the me- dium, and the subsequent absorption of it, are but parts of an adventitious function set up for repairing the injury. I have spoken of the necessity of position, which is the obtaining and the preserving a state of repose for the muscles of the limb. I have omitted band- ages, as I conceive that they are not merely useless, but injurious. I have seen that the cases that are treated without them turn out better than those in which they are used. But I apprehend they are injurious, because, although bandages may restrain the power of muscles, yet they by no means tran- quillise their actions; indeed, they rather excite them. But the great injury a bandage may do in all hurts is, that its pressure may cause that inflam- mation or action which is set up for repair, to be the cause of connections being formed amongst all the surrounding parts, so that adhesions take place of muscles to their tissues about them, or of tendons to their sheaths, and that when the part origin- ally injured is repaired, the patient has to contend with the imperfections that pressure has left upon the limb. Thus he may be waiting months, and sometimes enduring much pain, before the use of it is restored to him. If the bandage is not tight, it

As this change more commonly occurs in the trochlea in which the patella is lodged, it is generally detected on moving this bone over that surface, at the same time bend- ing the knee considerably; the sensation which this loss of cartilage gives, is quite that of a rough surface, and different from the crepitation of altered synovia. If this state of cartilage be pre- sent, a very distressing symptom attacks the limb at night, which is an irresistible jarring of the bones, gi'sdng at the same time great pain. It has been proposed to prevent this occurrence of the painful concussion by encasing the limb in a re- sisting apparatus. I have tried this expedient, but always found that the patients suffered more on the application of it than they did without it. The muscles which the disease has excited to pro- duce these irritable actions appear as if they Avere impatient under the restraint that is opposed to them. In this condition of things, more relief may often be procured by keeping the knee quite in a bent form on the side, in Avhich position the parts of the joint are left most loose, and therefore press least on each other. In this state of the joint, the plan of keeping up the influence of issues in tlie most active way, is the only one that can suspend the XI 3

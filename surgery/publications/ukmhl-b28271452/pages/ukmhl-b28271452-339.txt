This contrivance must have the effâ€œect of causing the issue to become very readily indolent. I think the issue made by means of some destruc- tive agent better than that by incision, as a more elaborate train of healthy actions is called into oper- ation to engage the powers of the parts in the pro- cesses of reparation.

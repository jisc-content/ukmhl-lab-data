SURGICAL PRACTICE. 154 we recognise the connection of these organs with such states. I have found that if boils are large, the division answers; but if small, they are best left to themselves. The surgery of carbuncles has been a long while settled; and in it we have, as in some other cases, a most decidedly beneficial practice handed down to us, without knowing, I believe, to what benefactor we are indebted for it. In the explanation of the natural history of carbuncle, we must place in a prominent view the state of the stomach; but to fix the precise character of the affection of this organ has not been arrived at. If the disease is found more commonly in the class of persons who luxuriate in dainty living, yet it is often seen in the hospital amongst those who cannot command indulgences. It has been said that luxurious feed- ing tends to it more than drinking. I have found in those cases I have had in the hospital, that the patients have invariably been addicted to drinking. The stomach is repulsive to food, and unfitted for the assimilation of the aliment that is offered to it. And co-ordinate with the defection of the stomach in the association of vital functions, the pulse is small, weak, and irritable, and the nervous system very excitable. The secretions, of course, as a part of the series in the train of the other symp- toms, are vitiated; the whole machine is under excess of action, but with defect of power. That this is primarily the beginning of carbuncle is proved by the successive re-appearance of the local disease, which seems to imply a constitutional cause.

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 84 leg is often broken is by a force applied at right angles to the limb, when the patient is erect; this force presses the bones into a bow, as it were, and they are broken with spicula at each end. They are much like the fracture of a green stick, and must be adjusted in the same manner. The stick can be restored to straightness, first, by bending it, and then by modelling the parts with the fingers ; to which I have already alluded. A third mode of producing the broken leg is, when the patient falls from a height, and the leg is obliquely placed, in- stead of perpendicularly, as he comes to the ground. The fall produces the oblique fracture, very gene- rally compound, with the sharp point of the bone projecting through the integuments. The case where the leg is caught between the spokes of a ladder, wheel, &c. is of the second class, and re- quires the same manipulation for adjustment. It has occurred to me to see a few cases in which the tibia has been broken alone, and without showing the least irregularity in its form; so much so that they might readily have been overlooked as fractures. The subjects were mostly children, and the accidents happened on jumping off a low height. I conceive the explanation of the production of the injury is, that in the fall, which is upon the foot, whilst the bone has to sustain the weight of the body pressing in the line of gravity, a lateral force is exerted in the direction in which the boy jumps; and the force resulting from the two, acting on the bone, breaks it in the way alluded to. I need not repeat that the chief points to be at-

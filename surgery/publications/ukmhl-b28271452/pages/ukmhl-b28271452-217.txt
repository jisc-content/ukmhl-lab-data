SURGICAL PRACTICE. 163 M 2 muscle has a small line running through it, which is equal to a tendon. The whole of the processes which this com- plaint presents to the notice of the surgeon are, in my views, conformable to those principles that are founded on the influence of the power for pre- serving functions which is implanted in the ani- mal economy. It must be observed, that as soon as this process of consolidation is effected, the muscle being noAV in a condition to act as a sphinc- ter, the parts are no longer urged with the same activity to go on healing; and thus these cases are often lingering when reduced to a very small sore. I have already remarked upon the etficacy of inserting a small piece of lint, and of the proof of its utility when we find this lint thrown out from the sore. This is the evidence of the healthy powers at work in healing the wound. I believe this removal of the lint is effected by the mere action of the healing process, and not by any in- fluence of the fibres of the muscle. If the parts be- come unhealthy and irritable, the lint is no longer thrown off, but remains. If the muscle reject the lint, it would do so still more actively when its fibres were most irritated. As this kind of fistula in ano is the most simple, and probably least com- plicated with other affections of the body, so it is by treatment effectually relieved, and the patient is left with a healthy condition of the parts. There is an abscess terminating in a sinus, that leads up by the side of the rectum, of a perfectly different kind from the above, and which has been

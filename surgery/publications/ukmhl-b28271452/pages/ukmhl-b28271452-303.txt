SUllGICAL PRACTICE. 249 heated body, of course the greatest destructive effect must be produced on the surface of the living structures, whilst the subjacent parts may undergo changes not destructive, but yet important to the future progress of the case. Most injuries are produced by forces limited in the duration of their possible action; whilst heat may be unlimited in the degree, extent, and duration of its action. If an individual be burnt by means of his clothes taking fire, there must of course be a series of changes going on in the structures exposed to it until the burning material be removed ; and these changes will vary in degree according to the amount of heat to which the parts are respectively exposed. If we now view the whole of the parts subjected to the heat, we find that, instead of the natural extensile quality of the integument and of the delicate cel- lular tissue, there is now a mass of indurated struc- ture calculated to resist the approximation of the edges of the sore, and retard the consummation of the healing of it. Indeed, it is this peculiar con- dition of parts that baffles the intention, when operations are undertaken for relieving the de- formities that burns occasion. The characteristic quality of a sore from burn is, that there is not only the sore which the slough has left, but also that there is a dense structure of agglutinated tissue cemented together, forming a substratum under the sore; and this unyielding base produces a difficulty in the progress of its healing. If we make a slough with a piece of fused potass, until tlie substance of the cutis be destroyed, when

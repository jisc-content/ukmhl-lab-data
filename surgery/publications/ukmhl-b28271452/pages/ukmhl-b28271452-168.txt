SURGICAL PRACTICE. 114 the mass, and thus the size and tension are di- minished and all pain ceases, I have, in the course of treating these cases, after a certain time made an opening through the fascia, and scooped out an immense quantity of coagulum ; the cavity sup- purated, and after which, the parts soon healed; and the patient perfectly recovered. This elFused blood presses also on the artery, so that the arteries of the leg may not be felt to beat. But the marked changes that take place on the third day clearly prove that the blood is not from an artery; for an artery would go on bleeding, and the tension would not so completely go off. The patient suffers throughout very little constitutional disturbance. Very often we have in the hospital somewhat simi- lar cases, where a waggon has gone over the legs, and broken the bones, as well as ruptured a vein; but the test of the third day declares that the great tension has been owing to a rupture of a large vein. As the pain and tension subside, then this fracture goes on as well as other mere broken legs. I adduce this as an instance of that difference to which I have alluded, between a great injury with wound and one without, in reference to the influence on the general system. I do not include in this de- scription those very severe injuries of bones and deep parts, where the magnitude of the injury of them is very great, and where the degree of violence to the integuments is apparently little. Hospital practice affords a considerable number of cases occasioned by persons being knocked down by waggons, and the wheels afterwards passing over

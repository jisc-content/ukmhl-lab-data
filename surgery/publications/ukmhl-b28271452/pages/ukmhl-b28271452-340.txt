SURGICAL PRACTICE. 286 made, produces no pain nor more than the slightest inconvenience, carrying on, in tranquillity and unob- trusiveness, its constant beneficial influence. Those applications which irritate the surface are, perhaps, inferior to blisters, as they call forth in a less degree the exertion of healthy actions. I consider the seton inferior to the issue, and where it is really beneficial, it appears only to be so when it is cutting its way out. The utility of issues really depends upon the circum- stance of their inducing the living powers to relieve structures from deranged actions, and to restore and make perfect natural functions. In the caustic issue, all the requirements for such an exercise of neces- sary processes is obtained: the moment the destruc- tion is effected, the healthful actions are brought into operation, and patients have often informed me that the pain in the diseased part has improved from this point of time. When the slough is thrown off, then that process which is described as the gran- ulating stage is still carrying on its healthful influ- ence on the disease; and even when the ultimate state of cicatrization is concluding the adventitious energies, I have been enabled to distinguish the un- abated beneficial influence. There is a quality even in the pea or bean that is subservient to the utility of issues : they are deposited in the place once a day dry, and of course do not fill the cavity which the moist one, now removed, has left, and therefore for some hours there is an energy in the parts of the issue to close in upon the body; and afterwards, as the pea swells, there is then an energy acting to increase the slightly contracted size of the cavity.

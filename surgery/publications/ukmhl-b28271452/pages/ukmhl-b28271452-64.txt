10 SURGICAL PRACTICE. a more certain power to preserve the joint in its situation, which is, the influence of the association of its moving power. I may make a short remark here, which is, that in stating the way in which the triceps is inserted into the femur, and the in- sertions of the muscles about the head of the joint, we see that if it were otherwise, the course of the peroneus longus, and the setting on of the tendo Achillis in the way they are arranged, would not be required. The true economy of a part is only got by studying these sorts of relations. I must now impress upon the reader, that what has been explained as to muscular action, is very much with a view to guide the surgeon in adopting the best positions of the limbs, or of the entire body, in injuries and other states where it is necessary to guard against the interference of muscles, in the course that may be proposed for the line of treat- ment in any one case. Thus, as all muscles are, for the most part, exercised in the forward move- ments of the body, and as very few jieople have much use of the muscles that act in a sideway motion, so when any one muscle is used in this forward motion, there are, by reason of the asso- ciation of actions, many others called into action ; to the injury, probably, of the case. Whereas, when the patient is placed on his side, owing to the disuse of the muscles calculated for this kind of movement, the whole system of muscular actions is more likely to be in repose, and has less chance of being excited by the laws of association. There is yet another law of muscular action that

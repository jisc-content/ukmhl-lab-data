272 SURGICAL PRACTICE. under less security when the glands are slightly inflamed than when the peculiar scrofulous in- fluence is active and energetic. Indeed, it is con- sonant to what has been before noticed, that the mutability of its seat is most common when its local manifestations encroach but slightly on the natural structures of the parts in which it fixes. As we assume that all scrofulous complaints are but an expression of that state of constitution which we understand by the term scrofula, so it must of course be true that the condition of scrofula being supposed to exist, the manifestations of this state may be brought out by contingent circum- stances, as well as by spontaneous evolution. Thus I have had in the hospital many cases of slight injury in the hands, feet, and legs in young persons, which, instead of going steadily through with the reparative process, have, after a week or two, put on all the features of a perfect scrofulous affection, and then lingered for very long periods with all the specific character of this disease. It appears to be a law in pathology, that when injuries, instead of exciting the processes of repar- ation, are disposed to go into a disease of another character, that the probability of this change in the local symptoms will take place is inversely as the severity of the injury. When this is considerable, the energies for earring on the processes of health are more strenuously called forth, and the powers better sustained for completing the restoration. lJut hurts of a slight kind not calling forth any remarkable degree of healtliy action, leave the

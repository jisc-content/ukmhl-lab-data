158 SUEGICAL PRACTICE. may be secreted has a way to escape. The in- cisions rouse the powers of the part to more effec- tual exertions. That injury which a clean incision of the cutis makes is, for the most part, as seen in our daily practice, an appointed stimulus for the effusion of lymph, and therefore always indicates an effort for repair, however untoward contin- gencies may derange this course. When this effort is shown, we have the assurance of a step made for reparation. In the division made in a carbuncle, we have an instance where the patient, although writhing under the pain of a severe gash, yet confesses that he is very completely relieved from that painful burning which the disease causes. There must be some direct association between the sensi- bility of the cutis and the stimulus of a simple incision, and thus the instantaneous change from the pain of carbuncle to the mere smarting of a clean wound. It is really a fact that the incision converts the derangement leading to destruction into the function for reparation. Occasionally there occur small carbuncles in the limbs; they are never large, and get well, but they go on increasing, and equally require the incision. I have had very large carbuncles to treat, but never saw a patient die of the complaint, except when it has been in the head. There must in this, as in most complaints, be a reci- procity of actions between the local mischief and the general derangement of the system. The effect of the incision is most marked; it has the power of immediately tranquillising the part, but parti-

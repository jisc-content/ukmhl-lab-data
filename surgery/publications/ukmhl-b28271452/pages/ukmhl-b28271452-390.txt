336 SURGICAL PRACTICE. tliG natural structure of tlie part is (tuite dilferciit from that of the others; and although the thickening of the chancre may be of a spongy kind, it is still more condensed than the proper tissue of the part. These are circumstances that produce some slight varieties in chancres, even when left to their natural course. But the great dilferences in the appearances which chancres present depend upon the changes and checks which they sutfer by the interference of injudicious art. The venereal dis- ease is so much known and discussed by all classes, that every one fancies he knows something about it, and therefore the chancre that is presented to the surgeon is too often disguised to appear in its true light. Even the practitioner is too much dis- posed to apply nitrate of silver, by which he is often deprived of convincing proofs of the unequi- vocal nature of the disease during the course of treatment. There is no doubt that occasionally ex- ternal treatment may be instituted that will arrest the entire course of a chancre, but most commonly any local means for disturbing the true formation of it, will only lead to uncertainty in the future treatment, causing embarrassment to the sur- geon, and delaying the recovery of the patient; and, therefore, whatever course is then adopted, it is likely to be broken in upon, and not to be car- ried out with that steadiness which the complete recovery of the patient from, this disease requires. Notwithstanding the continual resort to some means for arresting the full development of a chancre, we still find that patients arc not saved from the attack of secondary symptoms

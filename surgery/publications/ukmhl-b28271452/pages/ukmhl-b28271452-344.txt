SUKGICAL PRACTICE. 29U which the admirable formation of the limb so well admits. He thus gets every protection for stepping without jarring the affected part, and in the disease of the knee he also escapes some of the effects which would arise from the strong pressure of the bones against each other. By this mode of stepping he escapes much of the suffering which he would have to endure if the limb were kept straight. The best way of examining a knee to ascertain the state of the disease, is, having the patient in bed, to place the knee in a slightly bent position, to move the patella so as to ascertain that the Cartilages are not affected, and then to bend the limb every way, by which any tenderness of the surfaces may be detected. I have already explained why the knee should be bent. The most tender spots are usually over the lateral ligaments. The most unequivocal sign of commencing disease is that sensation which the patella gives when the flat hand is gently pressed upon the lower part of this bone, for dis- covering which this bone must be loose, which is only the case when the knee is bent. The sensa- tion this pressure gives is more like a crepitation of effused air than any other that I am aware of. It is the result of the altered state of the synovial fluid. It is a sensation quite unlike that arising from loss of cartilage. There is also at this time a greater evolution of heat, which fact is sensible to the hand. In the very early accession of this complaint, it will often be perfectly relieved by the patient strictly adhering to keep the bed, and by cupping or leeching once or twice.

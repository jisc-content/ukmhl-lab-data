SURGICAL rRACTICE. 204 must be observed in the use of it. In very straightened strictures, the soft wax bougies do not offer sufficient firmness, and then the catgut presents a very convenient substitute. I fully be- lieve that a stricture can be cured if a fine catgut can be once got into the bladder. Much has been said about the curve best suited for an instrument to glide easily into the bladder, and each surgeon gets partial to one form. It im- plies ignorance of geometry to suppose that the curve of the instrument should be the same as that of the passage. The natural line of the urethra is an irregular curve. Now, except the straight line, it is only circles of the same diameter that can be adapted to move regularly in the same curve. The curve of the urethra is not a circle, but made up of various curves. The dimensions of the pelvis differ in men as well as in women, particularly from pubis to sacrum; and this circumstance should vary the curve of the instrument. I think the best form is a large segment of a circle of a large di- ameter ; but a surgeon should accustom himself to any form of the instrument, and to any position of the patient in passing it. The method of using it is of more consequence than the curve; and as the figure of the urethra is of an irregular curve, the great point is to turn it over the shortest turns with as much adaptation of the instrument to the curve as possible. It will be easily conceived that the operator can transfer his guidance either to the point of the instrument or to some part nearer the handle; if he presses the point, he will

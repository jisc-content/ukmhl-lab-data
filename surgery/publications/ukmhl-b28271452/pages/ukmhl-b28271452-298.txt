But I observe that surgeons are apt to confound this state Avith that of sphacelus or slough, which is merely the effect of the intensity of the violence inflicted upon a part, and where the injury is simply local, without the presence of any alteration in the pulse to indicate that the system is on the brink of sinking. It is of the utmost consequence that the surgeon should dis- criminate between these cases; for Avhere the death of parts is confined to the seat of injury, and the patient does not exhibit, by the cha- racter of the symptoms, that he is in a perilous state, there is time to see how far the effect of the violence has extended, and to Avatch the resources of nature in the course she takes for beginning reparation; in doing which, Ave not only do not submit the patient to an operation when he can least support it, but, what is very important, Ave can secure to the patient parts which through life may be of the utmost utility to him. It is, therefore, most desirable to have a clear AueAv of the features of the two cases. In the one description, it Avill be right not to inflict an ojieration where the consti- tution is already succumbing under an irresistible change produced by the violence done ; in the other, it will be Avrong to inflict an unnecessary injury, by operation, Avhere the system upholds the power of conservancy and gives other signs for lead- ing us to expect that useful parts may be preserved.

23 SURGICAL PRACTICE. c 4 arm and the new centre of motion for the muscles, when they do act, explain the reason of the appear- ances. The head, when the limb is moved, noAv is carried about a new centre, and therefore presses most painfully on the parts it encounters. The in- creased length of the arm should be borne in mind, as in fat subjects it may be the most unequivocal siffn of the nature of the accident. The next useful mark is the power of increasing the vacuity under the acromion, by raising the head of the bone. In the natural position, if the arm be elevated, the space between the acromion and humerus is les- sened; but if the head be in the axilla, it is in- creased. It might reasonably be supposed that the exi- gencies for reducing a dislocation would be those that resemble, only in a reversed order, the steps by which the injury was produced. But the surgeon has to encounter the most strenuous op- position from powers that may, Avithout manage- ment, baffle his strength to overcome them. It is a business in which muscles are both his opponents and his coadjutors. I wish to correct a notion which surgeons seem to have, that when a powerful traction is made upon a luxated limb, the direction of the traction may be changed by making some forcible pressure at right angles to it, so as to lift, as they call it, the head into the socket. The laAVS of mo- tion show that this cannot be done, except by a power little less than that laid upon the line of traction. I have often seen this lifting of the bone

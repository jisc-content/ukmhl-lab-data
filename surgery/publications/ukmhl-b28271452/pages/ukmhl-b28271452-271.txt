217 SURGICAL PRACTICE. with the injunction that no coagulum should be allowed to remain upon the part. I was on the point one day of leaving London for a few hours, when I was called upon to a case of bleeding fioin the socket from which a tooth had been extracted, and that in considerable quantity, the subject being a weakly middle-aged female. My confidence was such in the power of my means, that I left instruc- tions to clear away the coagulum, if any, and to apply turpentine to the part, and I ordered draughts of it to be taken, and went away without waiting to see the effect. I learnt afterwards that the bleeding had soon stopped, and the medicine in- ternally was not wanted. The most important step in managing aU cases of bleeding is, that the surgeon should be most careful to keep the bleeding vessel free from all coagulum. The smallest arteries will go on bleed- ing if they are covered with a clot, and many con- siderable hemorrhages will stop if the bleeding points are quite clear from all blood ; even rather large arteries will sometimes permanently cease to bleed, if kept uncovered and exposed to the air. This fact I have seen. It is known that if a divided artery be in eontact with a layer of fibrine, it has a strong affinity and aptitude to shoot into it, and it is possible that a clot of coagulum has a modified effect of this sort upon the orifice of an artery, so as to keep it from contracting and closing. It is, however, certain, that a coagulum over a bleeding arteiy keeps up hemorrhage. It is by this means that all styptics have generally failed, while for the

We must nevet forget that, in the animal economy, power necessarily follows tranquillity, and that without this state of tranquillity, we can never expect a return to health. If we can arrive at the possession of the means of restoring a disturbed state to an orderly and tranquil one, we have the means of employing aids for raising the power. In all cases where we have a tolerably temperate liver as a patient, we may assume that if we have in great injuries secured tranquillity in the exercise of the functions either original or contingent, we have placed our patient in comparative safety. But in estimating the qualities of injuries and the powers the surgeon can bring into action, he has opposed to his expectations a most formidable obstacle that may beset him, beyond all foresight, in his calculations; that to which I allude is the very common discovery that the patient has a lurking disease in some organ, which the disturb- ance the new injury has produced, rouses into the active exercise of its morbid tendencies; and both now combine to oppress the general health. The lungs, the liver, and the kidneys, in post mortem inspections, often prfeve the cause of the failure of our operations. AÂ¥hen we find a wound, either after an injury or an operation, looking reasonably healthy, and yet the patient lingers with an irritable quick pulse, &c., we know that, besides the external wound, there is another source for a fatal result.

304 SURGICAL PRACTICE. bed, to let the limb lie easily on the side, and merely bathe the part with warm water. The soreness and pain of the injured spot every day lessened, and in a fortnight they were almost gone. I then allowed her to sit upon a sofa ; in another week all pain had left, and before the month was over she was able to move about as usual. The unfettered way in which the limb was allowed to repose al- lowed full vigour to the exercise of the reparative powers. It is precisely in the same way I have suc- ceeded in completely and shortly setting to rights a rupture of the tendo-achilles. No contrivance is required to keep the ends of the ruptured parts in apposition. If the limb is left free and easy, the uniting medium will be the sure means of ap- proximating the parts to each other. I have adduced the circumstance of a wound of the tongue doing very well if let alone, as an instance of the great influence of the conservancy of function in producing the reparation of in- jured parts. I conceive that no mechanical con- trivance can be imagined on rational principles to facilitate the healing of this part when divided, yet the surgeon may most confidently rely, that there is a power beyond what he himself can exer- cise that will fully accomplish it. This influence which function has over structure is very much in proportion to the organization of parts. Thus the organization of the cutis in the back is by no means so perfect as that of the face and head ; and I have observed, that in the very great number of incisions that I have made

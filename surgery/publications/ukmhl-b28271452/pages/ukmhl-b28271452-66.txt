SURGICAL PRACTICE. 12 muscle. We find, in the first days of this kind of fracture, that owing to the disturbance which the absence of the integrity of the bone gives to all the muscles engaged in moving it, the deltoid ^vill raise the upper portion, and give great appearance of deformity to the limb, and apparently baffle the aim of the surgeon to get a straight union. And this will be the case if he brings the lower portion away from the side of the body to meet in apposition the upper projecting part. Instead of doing this, he has only to take measures that the lower end should hang easily by the side of the patient, and he will find the upper jiortion fall into the straightest position he could possibly desire. When the upper arm is hanging quietly by the side of the body, then the deltoid is in a state of the least possible action. In this way of reasoning it is that I find this fracture unite in a remarkably straight form. Upon the principle of relaxing muscles by approxi- mating their attachments, the very reverse practice to this would be adopted, which is, the raising the arm to the level of the acromion; this I have seen done in such cases, but most fruitlessly. There is another law of conditions under which muscles act, which is of the utmost consequence to the surgeon. It is this which explains in my mind the difference in the characters of luxations, in reference to the facility or difficulty of reduction. This law is, perhaps, a corollary following that prin- ciple which requires the necessity of association in the actions of muscles. What I allude to is, the overpowering strength which a muscle is brought

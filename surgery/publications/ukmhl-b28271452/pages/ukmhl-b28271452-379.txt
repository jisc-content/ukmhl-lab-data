The power of a gentle inhuence, acting con- tinuously, cannot be better proved than in the reduction of long-standing irreducible hernia. The adhesion to the sac does not prevent the return of the protrusion, as this membrane will be carried with it. We have, in the csecal hernia, evidence of what the constant influence of some force, acting imj)erceptibly, may do by protruding not only a portion of the bowel, but also the structures to which it is connected behind, the peritoneum being only in front. The bowel moves with its own attachments, and appears, as it were, growing to the part where it presents, and therefore it is irreducible by manipulation. I do not recollect that any case that I have seen of ciecal hernia operated upon has recovered; and I believe this may have arisen, from the great handling of the parts, in order to push the part into the abdomen, which I have never seen done; and therefore I consider the attempt most objectionable: and when the nature of the case is clear, I think it should be left untouched. I have seen a protrusion of bowel continue some days with- out very urgent symptoms; but the operation having- been resorted to afterwards, there has appeared but little strangulation of the vessels of the part, yet the bowel was found ulcerated at the place of stricture, particularly in femoral hernia, where the bowel turns upon Gimbernatâ€™s ligament. It ]wo- bably happened that a slight adhesion liad taken

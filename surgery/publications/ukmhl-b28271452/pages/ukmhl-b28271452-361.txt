SURGICAL PRACTICE. 307 may vary very considerably. A velocity may be given to a common liammer that may make the momentum equal to a heavy mass moving slowly. Upon these principles it is that great varieties oc- cur from the impetus with which blows on the head are inflicted. If the mass be small, and the velocity great, it must happen that the bone 'will be frac- tured and driven in at the part struck; on the other hand, if the mass be great but slowly moved, the impetus acts in a way that allows it to be dif- fused over the whole head. And in this way great violence may be done without fracturing the bone ; which is usually the state in cases of severe con- cussion. Or the force may be ex23ended at the base of the skull, producing fracture there, and not at the vertex, the 2)RTt in which the blow may 2>ro- bably have been given; and it still further often ha2)pens, that in the severe injuries of this kind, where there is evidence of so much internal violence having been produced, that there is no mark of in- jury in the scalp. A misconception seems to 2>revail res2>ecting the appearance of the inner table of the skull breaking to a greater extent than the outer. The breadth in which a stricken will break, must vary in proportion to the velocity of the striking body, and also to the cohesion or stickage of the matter struck, and the breadth Avill always be, under any circumstances, some slight degree greater than the imi^inging body. If the fragility of the inner table be really greater than the outer.

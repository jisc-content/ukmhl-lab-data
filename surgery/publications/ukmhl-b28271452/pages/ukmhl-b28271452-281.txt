227 SURGICAL PRACTICE. ficial influence of placing the veins in a situation by which they may exercise their functions in the order most according with their natural state. Without adverting to the usual way of accounting for varicocele, I shall only notice that I have inva- riably found that the condition necessary for its production is a very relaxed scrotum, which is a state by which the veins are placed out of those limits included in their original endowment. If a system of vessels be ordained to exercise certain functions in a given extent of surface, and by some supervening cause this is increased, then this alter- ation becomes the excitement to the vessels of the part to accommodate their size and elongation to the changes thus produced. In this way I conceive the elongated scrotum causes the variation in the structure of the veins to meet the altered con- dition of it. It is only to place the patient in a state where these vessels exercise their function without being oppressed by inordinate exertion, and they become healthy and restored to their natural state. I have seen this often take place. It is the relaxed, or perhaps the superabundant quantity of scrotum, that presents itself to the surgeon as the cause, and it has been proposed to cut away a portion of this structure, that the testes may be braced up to the pubis. This is by no means a mild operation ; for if the tunica vaginalis be only very slightly cut, it will be followed by all the excessive disturbance in the system that the suppuration or inflammation of this part induces.

44 SURGICAL PRACTICE. sure on the parotid gland is also calculated to increase the quantity of saliva. Many cases of fracture of the lower jaw occur in hospital practice. We must bear in mind, in refer- ence to this bone, that it is highly organised, and therefore its powers of reparation are very great. We find, on this account, that it unites quickly, and that the deformities left are often completely removed ; also, in necrosis, the part readily exfoliates. That part of the lower jaw which is most commonly broken (where the force is applied so as not necessarily to cause it to break in one particular spot) is usually at one of the cuspidati teeth, as the jaw is weaker at this part than elsewhere, owing to the tooth sinking deeper into it. As the muscles for closing the jaw are inserted into the posterior part, and those for opening it into the anterior part, so if the head is kept up and the jaws closed, there is a constant effort made in swallowing to separate the j)ortions of the fracture. I have seen many contrivances for keeping the parts in coaptation, some having all the merit of the thumb-screws for producing pain, but they were perfectly worthless for the purpose for which they were designed. In short, I have seen but little done in this way by any bandage. The obvious method is to keep the jiatientâ€™s chin upon his chest, when the muscles will get quite passive, and will then in the least possible way dis- place the bones. The bed is the proper place to carry out this measure. The only muscular derangement in the neck tliat

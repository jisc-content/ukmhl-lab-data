It is not only to the vascular system, but to the sympathetic associations, that we must refer the changes that are produced in the distant part. The power which artificial actions instituted in one part can exert over other parts in a state of disease, is not only to moderate the activity, but actually to change the form from depraved to healthy action, and to ex- cite them to commence the process of reparation.

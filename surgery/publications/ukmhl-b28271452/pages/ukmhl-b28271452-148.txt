94 SURGICAL PRACTICE. all effort to expectorate, and very soon, I have no doubt, the body would easily pass off. I have fur- ther to notice, that in this case we have evidence that the functions of life often oppose the principles of statics ; for I infer that the foreign body would be less likely to pass out if the patient was placed with his heels upwards than when he Avas sitting up, be- cause the process of expectoration is a function most easily carried on in the erect position of the body. I have said as a condition it is necessary that the body be moveable; of course a pointed body, such as a pin, does not offer the probability of being under the same favourable circumstances for ejection. Both children and adults are in the habit of swalloAving pins and needles. As these, of course, may produce the most serious mischief, it is right to remove them, if possible, up, which I have done sometimes by means of a hook: if this can be got beloAv the body, and the hook includes the body in it, this happy event may result. On the common principle of bodies in motion, Avhen a pin or even a needle is free, it must move Avith the blunter extremity forwards ; and therefore in the present case, if the hook acts to move the body, it must bring the head of it toAvards the pharynx, and it Avill, perhaps, be discharged. If the same body be pushed doAVUAvards, it is the head which will be moved in that direction. It is in this Avay that needles pass to various parts of the body, and also that the SAvalloAving of them is attended, for the most part, Avith so much less evil than

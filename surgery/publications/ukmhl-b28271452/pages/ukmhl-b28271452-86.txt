SURGICAL PRACTICE. 32 I have already explained the way in which frac- tures of the shaft of the humerus are to be treated. By letting the upper arm lie quietly by the side of the trunk, and allowing it to take this position as free as possible from all encumbrances, it will unite perfectly straight, and soundly. This bone, as in the case of all fractures, should be relieved of all apparatus the moment it is firm in its union. We have many cases of that injury in which the epiphysis of the lower part of the humerus is separated from the shaft. This accident simulates, at first view, dislocation, but is easily discriminated by keeping the attention fixed to the radial joint with the humerus. These cases occur, of course, in children, and in very young ones as far as I have noticed, and therefore give trouble in the treatment, as more restraint over muscles is necessary at very early ages. The attention is required to secure the union to take place in a straight line. The treatment must be conducted upon the principles I have laid down, as far as the necessary restraint will permit. I have had many cases in children also, but of rather greater ages, of separation of the condyles. It seems that the one condyle indifferently may be detached from the shaft of the bone to which the other remains duly attached. It is here also that the radial part of the joint will detect which con- dyle is broken from the shaft. In either case the treatment is the same; it is to procure quietness. The best apparatus is that of only two splints on either side of the forearm, to prevent this part of

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 194 ally to yield and give way only in a small point, but suddenly by a rent of some size; and the urine, unrestrained by that barrier which the thickening has formed around the place, is pro- pelled into the cellular structure about the mem- branous part of the urethra, and thence pos- sibly in every direction that the neighbouring fascia will allow it to take. Of course it is re- strained from going backwards, but it may pass forwards in all directions to the scrotum, penis, groins, and abdomen: I have even seen it urged almost to the arm-pits. It is thus a very grave case, both from the character of the health of the individual, and from the wide extent to which the urine may carry its deadly influence. This de- structive fluid is propelled more largely, and more widely, on every elfort the patient makes to empty his bladder. It is necessary to make a large open- ing into the perineum, not only to discharge the effused fluid, but to secure the most open and the shortest passage of the water from the bladder on micturition. It has been supposed that it would be necessary to make an opening also into the urethra, but j\Ir. Abernethy has long ago explained the useless- ness of such a proceeding. The opening into the tube is already made by the rent, and is equal to all the occasions for it. The etfusion of the urine has really dissected the urethra, and often the issue of the water through the aperture may be seen to be freely going on. This is the great point of practice, to insure the free discharge by the sliortest course in the perineum. Other openings

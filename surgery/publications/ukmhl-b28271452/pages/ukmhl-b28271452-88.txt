S4 SURGICAL PRACTICE. be easily restored to their proper place. The triceps, only slightly disturbed by losing its ordinary course of action, keeps the arm somewhat extended, and poised between it and the brachiaeus and biceps ; but as the arm is being bent, its action becomes lessened to the least degree, and the two other muscles increase their power upon the bones, so as to draw them into their position. The brachiaeus may be ruptured in the backward luxation. If the oper- ator attends to what is going on, he will distinctly feel the effort of the triceps to diminish, and that of the biceps to increase, as he bends the arm. These cases exemplify the position I have laid down, that the resistance of muscles in dislocations is in proportion to the distance at which they are removed when acting, from their appointed centre of action. In these three dislocations their direc- tion of action is but little different from that of the sound joint, and therefore they offer comparatively little resistance. The most so, when they are forced backwards, as the triceps is then drawn out of its proper direction; but as this muscle becomes qui- escent in proportion as the arm is bent, so it yields readily then, instead of acting more forcibly, as is the usual opinion. Occasionally, but yet rarely, we have had cases of that luxation of the radius where this bone is thrown up on the humerus, or luxation forwards, as it is called. This is an accident in the pro- duction of which the muscles have but little influ- ence ; they are therefore as little concerned in the method of conducting the reduction. The most

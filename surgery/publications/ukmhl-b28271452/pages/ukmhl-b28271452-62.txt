8 SURGICAL PRACTICE. actions, must be best likely to insure health to the internal organs. In the carriage of a person may be seen the nature of his disease, and in his carriage may consist one source of health. Pecu- liar labours thus give character of diseases to those engaged in them, and transmission will perpetuate the deterioration already begun. A result of this association of muscles in their actions, is, as far as I conceive, a circumstance of a peculiar interest ; at least, it is a fact directly opposed to the usual reasoning pursued in these cases. It is this,â€”that as they are combined to act in a given way, so they will not exceed the limits which is set to them by this arrangement of asso- ciation. Thus in the hip-joint, where there is a complexity of muscles about it, and where there are some that may be supposed to be calculated to draw the femur up, the moment the opposition to this movement may be taken away, yet I believe this retraction would not be the case ; but that it is, on the contrary, an abiding quahty to go on acting about their centre of motion, without deviating from that arrangement of action which is implanted in them; so that, if it were possible to remove the acetabulum without any undue excitement to the muscles, (which excitement indeed happens in dis- locations, to be explained in another manner,) then none of the muscles which by their insertions might be thought ready to draw the head of the bone away, would really do so, but that the part would be kept in its ordinary situation under the influence of this combination of active powers.

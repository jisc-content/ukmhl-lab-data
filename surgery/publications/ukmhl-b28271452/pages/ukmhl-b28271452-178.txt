124 SURGICAL PRACTICE. limb, and the preservation of the life of the patient, are of infinitely more importance than his having an unsightly limb, and every less evil must yield to the best means of preservation. But whilst he urges the absolute necessity of insisting upon the quietude of the limb, he has other demands upon his attention and anxieties. He must keep the closest watch upon the pulse, and promptly throw in stimuli, if, as the hours advance, the circulation does not rise to what we call sympathetic fever. But whether the respon- sive powers induce this state of fever, or we force them up to the point, we are to bring the secre- tions to as perfect a state as possible: the dis- ordered state of them is the great index of the change that has for the time been efifected on the system; and the restoration of them is the first notice of the approach of the orderly progress of all the functions, and of the establishment of suppuration. When the suppurative stage is established, then the limb may be safely looked at, and re-adjusted with comparative impunity; but still with careful observation of the effects of the changes that have been going on.

We find that if a compound fracture be put up in one position, and it be soon changed to another, the alteration produces pain and distur- bance, both local and general.

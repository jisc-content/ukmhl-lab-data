6 SURGICAL PRACTICE. one affected, it is only to put into action strongly, the flexor pollicis longus, by pressing the toe against some substance, when all cramp at once ceases. These two muscles are associated by reci- procity of action, and as the one motion is strongly called forth, the other gives way to the minimum of action, and thus the cramp is removed by the law of consentaneity existing between all muscles of one joint. The biceps flexor cruris is also a muscle very liable to cramp; by bending the leg on the thigh, and rotating the tibia inwards by means of the inner ham strings, the foot being pressed against some resistance, at once the cramp goes. Rubbing a cramped muscle rather adds to the suffering, and the approximating the attachments, or what is called relaxing the muscle, has no effect at all. The centre of gravity of the animal body en- gages the whole muscular system in its service, and directs all its powers for preservation, when the body may be endangered by the force of gravi- tation, the centre of that system in which we exist. It is probable that, if all the muscles of the body were developed to the utmost powers and associations they are capable of assuming, the body would be most accurately balanced in every possible position; and that even in any slight de- clension from the due equipoise of the whole, the limbs would be thrown out with accuracy and precision to protect the frame from injury. In such an order of things, not only would the many falls not happen, which are so frequent now, but if

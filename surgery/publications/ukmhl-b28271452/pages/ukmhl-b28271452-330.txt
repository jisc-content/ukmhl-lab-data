Cases are continually presented to him of this truth from friction about the foot. Therefore no irritating application should be applied to the parts over an inflamed gland ; and if such substances are ever justifiable, they are only to be tolerated when the part is perfectly free of tenderness, and decidedly indolent; mere friction is equally objectionable. The application of leeches to inflamed glands is so gene- rally accepted as a point of practice that they are never omitted as a reputed remedy.

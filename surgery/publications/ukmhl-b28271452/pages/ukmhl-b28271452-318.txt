SUllGICAL PRACTICE- 2U I have seen a fearful amount of constitutional disturbance ensue from opening bursa3 when they have been in a quiet state, although this prac- tice may be sometimes pursued without showing any ill results. When large and very much thick- ened, I have removed them, but in doing this have nearly lost a patient, and I have seen another actually die from this operation. In the case under my care, erysipelas took place, the inflammation extended to the fascia of the thigh, which sloughed, and this placed the patient in the utmost danger. Where the loss of life may be so imminent, I conceive that no judicious surgeon would urge an operation for a complaint that may be carried through life without much annoyance. These bursae are structures of low organisation, and are so intimately connected with the fascia, that any injury of the one will lead to the inflammation of the other structure. I do not know of any advantages that can accrue from the removal of these bursae that can be placed in competition mth the serious event that may be the consequence of the operation. There is another case of inflammation and thick- ening of that bursa which is placed between the ligament of the patella and the head of the tibia, which may also be called the housemaidâ€™s knee, as it arises from kneeling. This case is accom- panied by much pain, and is more difiicult to set to rights than that which forms upon the patella. The bursa between the semimembranosus and the tibia now and then presents itself enlarged. I have usually found that persons who take long walks

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 156 course the secretions become vitiated, and there- fore the nervous system is deranged. In the lan- guage of Hunter, it is a state of excess of action without power. It is a state which we find to be accompanied by very weak powers of action, parti- cularly in the subcutaneous tissues, and where the power being unable to support this excess of action, the part either dies, or goes into ulceration. And it is quite possible that a cause so slight as not to be recorded in the memory of the patient may fix the disease in that very part in which it occurs. As in boils, so in carbuncle, the occurrence of the local affection is generally seated in the back. In the incisions to be made in carbuncle, two con- ditions are to be observed: the one is, that they should go to the bottom of the slough of the sub- cutaneous tissue; the other is, that they should include the full extent of the inflamed skin; for if these directions are not attended to, the inflamma- tion will still go on extending, and a repetition of incisions will be required. After this operation the usual advice has been, to apply strong stimu- lating applications to the part at once, but I re- gard this as injudicious treatment: the part has laboured under considerable action with weak power, and as soon as the incisions have been made, by which the pain is immediately relieved, the parts should be soothed into tranquillity by mild applications. It follows, that as the parts have been under great action with low power, when the action has subsided, the power is still of the lowest kind, and the reparative function

There is a very considerable variation arising from the affection and aptitudes of different minds, in giving the direction and exciting the energies to one class of intellectual exercises rather than to others. As the compliance with this partiality is always accompanied by more earnestness than when the mental energies are otherwise employed, so the greatest powers of the mind are then most likely to be developed. There is an inherent difference in the quality of the intellect, which produces a marked distinc- tion in the capability and power which the mind possesses. The very acute and perspicuous Pascal* has described the minds of men to be readily divided into two classes ; the one that of “ I’esprit de finesse,” the other “ I’esprit de geometrie.” The character of “ I’esprit de finesse ” indicates that when the mind is satisfied with the acuteness of its penetration, and the clearness and correct- ness of its perceptions, it has sufficient for con- vincing the understanding. And therefore this kind of mind forms its judgment upon such principles only; being unaccustomed to the laborious pro- cesses of the geometrical mind. “ L’esprit fin, on, de finesse,” may be turned into English by tlie word perceptuous, as the conception of it has arisen * Pascal, Pensees, &c.

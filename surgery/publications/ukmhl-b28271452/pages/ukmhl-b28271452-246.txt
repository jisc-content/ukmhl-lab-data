192 SURGICAL PRACTICE. for conducting it out of the very orifice. If the principle of hydraulics were allowed to have their full agency, the water would be scattered through all wounds in the urethra in a way very different from what we observe to be the case. In insisting upon the propriety of laying this tu- mour or small collection of matter open as soon as possible, it must be evident that a great advantage will result by having thereby a less extent of altered structure to deal with, and consequently a more favourable state for the ultimate healing. But Avhat is very important, we prevent the interruption of the natural economy of the part, and preserve the powerful influence which the conservancy of func- tion exercises over structures. Thus if, with the exception of a few drops, the urine is conducted in the usual way through the urethra, there is a strong disposition in the parts to repair this little defect, and to sustain in perfection the integrity of the function. On the contrary, if the tumour be al- lowed to increase, and the o23ening in the tube to enlarge, together with a greater extent and degree of induration throughout, when the opening after- wards is made, a large quantity of fluid passes through, and probably with little uneasiness, offer- ing a new channel which really supersedes the office of the urethra, and diminishes those energies that arise out of that influence which the preservation of function has established. Upon these principles it is that I object to the keeping an instrument in the urethra in case of fistulas, inasmuch as it in- terferes with the appointed economy of the part.

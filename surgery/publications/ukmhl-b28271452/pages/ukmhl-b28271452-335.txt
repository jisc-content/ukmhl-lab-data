281 SUEGICAL PRACTICE. at all unusual to find the disease altogether kept in abeyance during those years that childbearing is going on, while at the close of this period it bursts forth with increased activity, often speedily pro- ducing a fatal termination. A man labouring under disease of the lungs was brought to the hospital on account of a wound of the brachial artery in venaa- section. I secured the artery, but the quantity of efiused blood had so distended the part that a large cavity was formed, and of course considerable sup- puration ensued. The wound did exceedingly well, so that in about three or four weeks it was quite healed. During the time the wound was discharging he had no pain in the chest, no expectoration, nor any cough; but as soon as the wound was nearly closed, the cough returned. He then left the hospital, and I heard afterwards that he died in a month, the disease of the lungs having rapidly carried him off. In about a twelvemonth afterwards I had another case precisely similar in all respects, and where the patient also died in about a month after the wound in the arm got well. When the energies of the conservative principle are fully called into exercise for the reparation of great injuries, other diseased organs are left quiescent in their progress, or they are altogether relieved of the diseased state. The conservative influence which excites the healthy actions ordained for restoring injured parts can impart to adjacent structures a disposition, as it were, to convert a disease into health ; and it is thus even scrofulous affections may be controlled and cured. We have, in physiology, a state of actions

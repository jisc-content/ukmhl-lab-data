But if he directs the force Avhich is to move the catheter to another spot on the instrument, then it Avill pass smoothly on parallel with the sides and in the course of the canal, and he will be least likely to do harm. It has been a wrong instruction to direct that AAdien the instrument is passed with the convexity to the abdomen, as it gets under the arch of the pubis, it should be turned, making then the point fixed as a pivot, so as to bring by this one movement the concavity to the abdomen. This aaqII probably make a fold in the membrane, and impede its easy course. Any turn that may be required should not stop its onward progress, as it Avill then glide forward Avithout ruffling the urethra. The operator may commence the introduction of the instrument as he pleases, but it should be kept gently moving on, and Avhen the point gets to the arch of the pubis the handle should at the same time be kept close to the groin, and as the point moves forwards the handle should be brought round in front of the abdomen, and then brought forward, by Avhich moAnment the point Avill readily take the upward direction that leads into the bladder. But in all difficulties, although slight, the finger should be passed into the rectum to guide the instrument. The surgeon should ahvays bear in mind that in young children the bladder lies very high in the pelvis, and that there is a long track of the mem- branous part of th(i urethra Avhere the textures arc very thin, and the pelvis being very narrow.

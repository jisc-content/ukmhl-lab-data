141 SURGICAL PRACTICE. But the persisting powers of reparation do not terminate in detaching the sequestrum from the living parts; they carry on the work to eject it from its case. In speaking of the cloacie, I might have said that it would be expected that these should be found at those parts where the muscles are not attached. The same provision is observed in the skull, if matter form slowly upon the dura mater; in venereal necrosis especially, the bone is perforated by many openings, so that the patient suffers none of those evils that occur in accidents of this part, where the matter is more quickly de- posited. In furtherance, then, of relieving the limb from the sequestrum, I have seen cases in which, when this has been quite detached, and one end of it has been near an opening, at the same time that the opening has increased in size, the end of the dead bone has protruded into it, and gradually started out, and becoming ultimately completely dislodged. I have often watched a sequestrum in its advance, and been able to appre- ciate its daily alteration in position, so quickly has it taken place; still more, with equal rapidity the new bone has subsided into its diminished and proper size, as the sequestrum was discharged. These are beautiful examples of the jiowers of nature. Why then may not the surgeon leave some operations to her better workmanship ? These cases also prove that there is a power, besides muscular action, which can put in motion parts of the animal structure. I have very often seen, as I before said, the necrosed bone, day by

SUliGICAL PKACTICE. 195 may be necessary to give vent either to matter or to dead cellular tissue. If the etfusion has existed a few days before the opening is made, there is also an accumulation of matter mixed with the urine. As in the former case it was unwise to irritate the urethra by instruments, it must be more so in the present state of things, where there is much more weakness of parts, and more general want of power. The further treatment will consist in restoring the best state of health to the patient, and of tran- quillizing the parts. Besides the employing mea- sures for improving an impaired constitution, there are additional means demanded for increasing the vital powers, in order to set free the various sloughs which the irritation of the urine may have'pro- duced, and to sustain the suppurative process. There is in this case no reason for interfering with the stricture, because the free opening made in the membranous part of the urethra prevents the im- petus of the current which arises from the ditferen- tial force of the fluid in its narrower stream through O tlie stricture, from affecting the tube, the whole force being expended on the fluid that escapes. I have known in these cases that the stricture some- times gets well without the adoption of the usual means for its cure. It is no unusual thing for a patient to find that after a week or two the water passes more easily and more fully through the orifice of the urethra than it had done a very long time before the effusion, although no bougie has been used.

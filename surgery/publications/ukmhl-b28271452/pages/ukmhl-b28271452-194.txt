140 SURGICAL PRACTICE. tion is proved by the almost sudden shifting of the attachment of the muscles. The bulky muscles of the limb, which at one moment are attached to the old bone, are at another connected with the new structure, and not the smallest interval is knomi to pass of their being unattached to either. The muscles suffer no moment to elapse in which they cannot move and support the limb. All their in- sertions remain in perfect order and integrity. This is that state of necrosis where every pro- vision is made for the ultimate state of perfection of the limb. The wall is quickly strong enough to sustain the weight of the body. In its con- struction, in order to guard against that very overcoming pain, which only one drop of matter pent up in bone produces, openings are left in the walls, and also in the integuments, for the escajie of it. With the aid of such effectual powers of â€¢ reparation, the sequestrum goes on to be detached. All this may require a lengthened time to be per- fected. Notwithstanding the vigorous proceedings going on for the safety of the limb, injudicious surgery will often spoil the happy work that is advancing. I have often seen an operation executed which has done nothing but give the greatest pain to the devoted patient, and loss of blood produced in cutting through the periosteum. I am clear that it is quite futile to attempt any operation, except the sequestrum be quite detached ; for if the least part be still connected with the living bone, this keeps up nearly as much irritation as the wliole sequestrum.

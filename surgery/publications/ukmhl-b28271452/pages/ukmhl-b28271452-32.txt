XXVI CLAIMS OF SURGERY TO BE vantage of the intellectual faculties of the mind, that those who have of late years put themselves forward as the best prescribers for medical education, have conceived that in huddling together all sorts of in- gredients for the students to swallow, they formed the surest way of perfecting the qualification of those dedicated to the healing art. The folly of such pro- positions must be apparent, even upon the principle that they could not be carried out in a way to be perfect. But the remarkable folly is that they should be so ignorant of the real nature of science. Science is a system of demonstrations, and a de- monstration must engage the mind in deliberations: deliberation is the employment of the intellect upon one or a series of inquiries into the relations of things. It must be, therefore, incompatible in a scientific mind to suppose that education can go on without periods of reflection. There must be resting stations for the repose of thought, that all the conditions and relations of each part of the subject, may be deliberately viewed, and brought into their proper positions and assigned relations. So far from giving the profession the real cha- racter of science, by making no distinctions in its branches, such a step must inevitably destroy the little pretensions it has for being classed as such. The suggestion entirely avoids all the material advantage of forming the mind to ex- ercise its powers, and of adopting a beneficial Avay of making use of what is really known. At

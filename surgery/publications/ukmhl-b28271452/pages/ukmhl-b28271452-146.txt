SUllGICAL PRACTICE. 92 which may be regarded as conservative, and which we find developed by the very disturbance which some natural function has received. I have already alluded to the sanative effect which the stimulus of a particle of dust excites when under the eyelid. (When I allude to this fact, I only mean to show the resources of nature, and not to inter- fere with the proper practice of removing the particle as soon as possible by art.) The surgeon, seeing this resource of nature, is to adopt only those measures that will conduce to her carrying out her own operations, and to avoid every inter- ference of officious practice. The mucous passages offer many cases to illustrate this position. I have seen a portion of the ear of barley slip into the nostril with the stalk-end foremost. Of course the least touch of a body so formed, in such a situation, must add to its further intrusion. It produced considerable irritation for a day or two, which then went off, and quickly after it came quietly away, coated with thick mucus, without any effort. This short history explains the prac- tice to be enjoined, which is, indeed, negative, as in the case of the particle under the eye-lid. The irritation it set up was to establish a new con- servative function, it was to clothe it with a thick adhesive mucus, more substantial than the common secretion of the part; yet still it was mucus, that it might exist as a secretion to which the structure is adapted, and on which it might act simply as a stimulus for its expulsion, the excitement being just sufficient for the purpose. It passes out in the

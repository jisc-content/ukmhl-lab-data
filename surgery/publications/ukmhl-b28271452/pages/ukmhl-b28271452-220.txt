166 SURGICAL PRACTICE. fill, and prevents the patient by its pressure from relieving his bowels. It is to be quickly opened; and in doing this there is a gush of very offensive matter, with coagula of blood mixed with it. The patient is at once relieved; and there is no opening into the rectum required, therefore it heals very quickly, as it would be supposed to do from the degree of activity with which it was produced; for generally, in proportion to the excitement by which the degree of inflammation is raised, is the aptitude of parts to take on the reparative functions. There seem to me to be two sources of excitement producing this sort of abscesses; the one, that of injury to the rectum by a hard substance swallowed, and puncturing the bowel, as has in some cases evidently been the case. The other the consequence of the inflammation and sup- puration of a pile. From hence the coagulum is derived, which the opening allows to escape. But I have often seen sinuses about the rectum which have been the result of matter forming from inflammation of the prostate gland. These, of course, are of a most enduring character, and offer to our endeavours slight chance of effecting a cure in con- sidering the sinus only. They must be left to the means the surgeon may have of subduing the diseased condition of this gland. If this gets quiet, the sinus Avill heal, and not before; so that all injections, divi- sions, &c. do little. A probe, by its direction, and by its detecting the peculiar hardness of the part with which it is in contact, decides the nature of the complaint.

If it seems going on to increase it may be let out safely, and will then soon get well, but if it has stopped increasing this need not be done, as it will then be absorbed, and do well without any ill consequence.

This, as well as the slight effusions between the conjunctiva and sclerotica, seem to act simply as a stimulus for relief, and the blood is very soon absorbed.

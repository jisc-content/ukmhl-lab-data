SURGICAL PRACTICE. 85 G 8 tended to in the treatment of simple fractures of the leg is to keep the patient on his side, the two hips being in a vertical line, and the whole limb so rest- ing that the external ankle, the external condyle, and the trochanter major may be in the same plane, to avoid bandages, to place one splint under and one over, sufficiently broad, so that the strap (not of leather) should not touch the leg. I need not say that, in the Aveakly subjects we often have in hos- pitals, it is quite necessary to watch that no pres- sure may be unduly applied. Most commonly, in three weeks, or even less time, I dismiss the splints, and often, in less than six weeks, the patient can walk out of the hospital. I shall here mention, that I have several times ^ had women, when pregnant, with broken legs, but found no difference in the progress of union. Most commonly the fracture of the fibula only requires little restraint in the limb after the first fortnight. There are few accidents more numerous than the various injuries to the ankle joint: they admit both the terms of luxation and fracture in reference to the construction of the joint. The mere inspection of the bones shows, that whilst the tibia rests ver- tically over the astragalus in the erect position, the fibula bears on the outer side of the astragalus, on its oblique plane, and supports the weight in that very slight degree which the laws of this part of mechanics explain ; and thus if such a state of things take place as to remove the support of the tibia, the fibula is left with so little bearing on the astragalus that it gives way and breaks. Thus if a

80 SURGICAL PRACTICE. course, is to take measures for tlie adaptation of the broken parts. For restoring the whole economy of the limb this is necessary, as well as in reference to the bone only; for we are aware that in proportion as this is etfected, so is the perfection of the union, and the shortness of time required for effecting it. To accomplish this coaptation, surgeons have been wont to conceive a high notion of extension. I believe it is rarely required. If the bones are broken with inequalities, it wiU not answer; if they are merely snapped asunder, it is not much wanted, as the bones will then lie quietly in fair position. It is astonishing how strenuously and how per- severingly I have seen some surgeons try to get the bones of the leg in coaptation, and all in vain. It is the surgeonâ€™s duty to ascertain the way in which the injury has been effected, and then he can adopt that way which is appropriate to the nature of the injury. If the force which effected the injury was applied at right angles to the leg, as when a wall falls whilst an individual is standing near it, and the leg is broken by a lateral force appbed against it, all power by extension in the manipulation will not reduce it; but if he bends it to the form in which the injury was produced, and then gradually, and with the hands applied to the fracture, brings it to a straight line, it may be most accurately adjusted. We are to take the example of the green stick, when partially broken. This adjustment, which is understood by the word coaptation, being effected, the cliief part of the treatment of a broken leg will be accomjdished ; if

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 70 state, lies with its upper part hollow, and the centre is therefore supported, as it were, upon a fulcrum; and in the action of the muscular system, to preserve the line of gravity of the body in its proper direction, the rectus femoris of course is deeply engaged, as arising from the trunk, and probably the crureus, by consentaneity of action : these are called into full power, and thus the upper part of the bone is broken otf. It sometimes has occurred in the cases I have had, that only a scale, or the mere part to which the rectus is attached, has been broken off. When this occurs, this scale is often carried high up; because the rectus, being free of the bone, can alone remove it so far. Such I conceive was the case which procured Mr. Hunter the credit of restoring the use of a limb after this accident. But if it be only a small scale, it must be remembered that the lower part is left in its original power of action, and therefore the pa- tient can move the leg on the thigh, but has lost the assistance of an useful aid in balancing. If the fracture be low down, near the ligament of the patella, there wiU then be less separation of the parts. In the above case of a scale, separated and high up, the same treatment is calculated to draw it down. No force can do it, but repose, and the approximating quality of new media, will effect it. But an accident essentially the same in its conditions sometimes comes under treatment. It is the separation of the attachment of the rectus and crureus from the patella, without a particle of bone being carried with them. A gentleman was

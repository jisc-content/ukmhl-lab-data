SUEGICAL PRACTICE. 346 sense of smell. This peculiar fetor is immediately removed at the very time the mercurial action is made apparent in the system. This effect of the me- dicine is quite incompatible with the supposition that it produces the disease. Another peculiarity of this disease of bone is the very slow advance of the processes engaged in producing exfoliation. We for a long while have to look in vain for the esta- blishment of that sulcus which we are in the habit of seeing in ordinary cases, when exfoliation has commenced. I have known the greatest misery result from the want of discrimination in cases of venereal necrosis. A gentleman had venereal necrosis of the parietal bone, he was put under the influence of mercury so far as to stay the progress of the disease but no further, and then the surgeon proposed and was allowed to adopt, the removal of the diseased part; but afterwards the adjoining bone became similarly necrosed, and the fetor re- turned ; in this state of things a second operation of removing more bone was resorted to, but the disease still went on, and the only result was, that the patient was doomed to pass the rest of his exist- ence in disgust with himself, and terminated a short life in misery. We find that a provision is made for the safety of the brain in necrosis of bones of the cranium in this disease, as we find on other occasions before the death is complete in both tables, a process is set up for forming openings or cloacae throughout the substance of the bone, so that no injurious eftect may arise from the collection of matter on the dura mater; but if the outer table only is affected.

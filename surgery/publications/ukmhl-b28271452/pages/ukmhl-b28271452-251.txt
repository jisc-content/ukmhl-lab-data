The subsequent treat- ment will be that of following the principles al- ready laid down. I regret to add that these cases often lead to permanent imperfections : the rent does not heal, perhaps, because there is some loss of the structure, and the stricture Avhich is formed does not yield to ordinary treatment. In adverting to the diseases of the prostate gland I have remarked that I am impressed with the opinion that this organ is very much more com- monly the subject of derangement than surgeons are willing to impute to it.

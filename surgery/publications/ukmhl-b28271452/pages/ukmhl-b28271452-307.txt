This is analogous to what we observe in all great lesions: there is a struggle in the constitution at this time to exert the first steps of the reparative processes, and if the powers of the patient are unequal to it, he will probably die, even if he has rallied from the first shock, which is rarely the case in very severe burns. And as in all cases where large sores remain to be healed, the patient has always the possible mischief to fear in an attack of erysipelas; a circumstance not to be forgotten in our prognosis. I am by no means disposed to regard erysipelas as infectious. There are conditions in the state of the body which readily lay it open to the influences of the atmosphere, in deranging the functions of the economy, and in establishing disease. This condition for establishing erythe- matous erysipelas, I have reason to feel assured, is the disturbed state of the secretions generally; and when the economy of the system is deranged in this way, the atmosphere becomes the exciting cause. We have many analogies in the influence of the atmosphere on the body for considering it as likely to produce the complaint, under certain states of the system. We attribute to this cause changes in the state of the mucous membrane of the nose, of the fauces, and of the air passages ; and the surface of the body is, in pathological circum- stances, closely allied to these structures. When we discover errors in the secretions, we may anti-

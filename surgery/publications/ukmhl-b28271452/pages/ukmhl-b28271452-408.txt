354 SURGICAL PRACTICE. progress of the complaint has gone so far as to pro- duce a large mass of diseased structure in a state of ulceration, pouring forth a great deal of offen- sive discharge. It is possible the patient may wish to be saved from this great annoyance, at least for some short time, at the expense of an operation. There is a form of cancer doubtlessly well known to surgeons where the scirrhus has commenced in the mammary gland, but very soon afterwards the integuments, instead of remaining smooth and de- licate as in the other parts of the body of the indi- vidual, become stiff and then hard, and afterwards become more like brawn than any thing else. The disease spreads in all directions, generally accom- panied with tubercles of the skin, and by means of its hardness and extent so presses on the mamma, that this part becomes shrunk up to a very small body. I have seen this change of structure continued round the body so that the patient was quite hide-bound, producing the greatest pain. I have more than once seen a modification of this description of case in which ulceration took place, and where the entire gland seemed to be removed, leaving the parts appa- rently in a healing state. However, the disease soon resumed its real character, and destroyed the pa- tient. In these cases the axillary glands have been early affected, and the same change in the integument has taken place over them, and in the arm, causing the most excruciating pain. Indeed, when the disease springs up in the axillary glands, after the removal of the breast, the patient has to go through the greatest suffering from the enormous uedema of the arm.

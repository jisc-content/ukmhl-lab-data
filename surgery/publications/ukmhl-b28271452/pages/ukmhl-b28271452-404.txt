350 SUEGICAL PRACTICE. proviDg. I have many times seen this disease retrograding, by a chancre becoming worse, whilst the patient was suffering much in his mouth, which, when bad, requires a long time to heal, and this may be long after the mercurial effect on the system is over. It appears that with those j)ersons who are remarkably susceptible to the influence of mer- cury, there is also an equal readiness for throwing off the mercurial action. I have found that in the administration of mercury for a chancre in females, as soon as the mouth is affected the sore will get well, and the hardness will be quickly removed; so that a short continuance of the medicine is usually sufficient in this sex to complete the cure. We find that a chancre on the fnenum is longer in being acted upon by the mercurial influence, than when its seat is on the glans penis or prepuce. I apprehend that the circumstance of the situation of these parts in respect of the circulation may explain both these facts. I may mention here that although we so invariably find buboes accompanying gonor- rhTca in the female sex, yet I observe that they are rarely attendant on chancres which occur in them. I have reason to speak in the highest terms of the cinnabar fumigation, which I have never found to fail in arresting the ravages of the rapid ulcera- tion, that we often find so formidable in the throat, and also in the penis; usually only one or two applications are required to change entirely the character of the sores, and to convert the destruc- tive state to a process of healing.

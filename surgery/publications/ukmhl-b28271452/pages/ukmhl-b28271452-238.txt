184 SURGICAL PRACTICE. quite healed. The power of conservancy of function is dominant here, and the fluid will pass through the urethra entirely, notwithstanding there is an opening through which it might escape. If he were to keep an instrument in the urethra, he would do worse than an useless thing; he would weaken those powers which result from the natural efforts of conservancy. When a stone in the bladder has been removed, it is quite possible that as this organ is relieved from the irritation of it, all the powers of restoration are elevated to an increased degree of energy. A stone is impacted in the urethra, it is cut upon, and an incision fully equal for its removal is made; afterwards surgical aid is little wanting, for the wound heals without trouble. I had a patient in the hospital whose glans penis had by deep ulcers been reduced to shreds; these shreds were ulcerated particularly at the base, and it seemed that the passage of the urine over them kept them from healing; seeing this, I made an opening through the spongy structure into the urethra just between the scrotum and the bulb: this fully accomplished the purpose I had in view; the ulceration of the ragged glans healed now it was not exposed to the irritation of the urine. But I had really difficulty in keeping the opening into the urethra from closing; and this took place rapidly when left uninterrupted. I have seen a stone about the size of a kernel of a nut lodged in the membranous portion of the urethra; and very soon after it arrived in this place the tube dilated so as to form a pouch for its lodgment, and this

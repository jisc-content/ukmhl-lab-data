SURGICAL PRACTICE. ones are as often being formed. As almost all muscular actions are performed in reference to a centre, so, when this centre is lost to muscles, as a bond of union of consentaneity, they, if they can find a new centre readily, go into a new combina- tion of action, as conformably as can be with this new centre. This ability to adopt states of transi- tion is, of course, the ability to be educated. There are professors of this class of educations; and if there is one period of life in which mankind sub- mit to it, there is also another period when indo- lence leaves the human body in the bad habits of awkwardness. Every joint is evidence, in the ordinary motions that are effected in it by the muscles for this pur- pose, that these motions can only take place by a combination of the moving powers. It can only be by an association of muscles in their actions, that we can carry food to our mouths, or, that which is much more difficult, can manage to drink. A proof of this association may (as I think) be exhibited in that affection which we call cramp. This is usually a state of muscle arising from either excess or diminution of the quantity of exer- cise that it is usualljT- accustomed to. Thus, those who take inordinately long walks, or those who by fits take no walks, are subject to it. If cramp occur in one muscle, as in the extensor of a joint,'and the flexor of the same joint be put into strong action, the cramp ceases immediately. If the ex- tensor pollicis proprius of the foot (a very com- mon muscle for the occurrence of cramp) be the

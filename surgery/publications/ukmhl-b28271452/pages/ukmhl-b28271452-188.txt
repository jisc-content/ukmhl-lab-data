134 SURGICAL PRACTICE. had a very good limb. This case must incite us to meditate on those circumstances in which the safety of such a case may differ from those miser- able results which mere punctures particularly pro- duce in the same part. Compound fractures of the arm are by no means infrequent. I have had very many under treat- ment, and they have turned out well, usually giving not much anxiety on account of the little general disturbance they produce on the consti- tution. The upper arm is not much bedded in muscles, and therefore there is in such cases less local derangement. This limb being nearer the centre of circulation than the thigh, it is better circumstanced to keep in a state of quietude than the other. I may here state that I have never seen a case of compound fracture of this bone that did not unite, nor indeed of the femur, under the same injury. Many cases occur in the hospital of compound fractures into the elbow-joint. I have always found these cases less formidable than the same injuries in the lower extremities. I have had lately a very severe case, in a gentleman who was thrown from his cab, while driving. A vast deal of injury was produced by the violence, and his state was for some time imminent. He, however, quite recovered, with the joint stiff, but with a very useful hand. I have had a vast variety of compound injuries of the fore-arm, and of the most formidable kind. Tlie numerous occupations which are carried on by means of machinery afford a large class of severe

49 SURGICAL riiACTICE. what we see going on in aneurism, where we find that when the middle coat, or that which has the character of muscle appropriated to it, has given way, the outer or fibrous one, however apparently strong, is unable to resist the impelling power of the circulation, and dilates to form the aneurismal sac. Many cases of injuries to the pelvis occur in hospital practice. One very common is where the anterior superior spinous process is broken off, or a portion of the crest of the ilium. These, like those analogous accidents of the scapula, are very painful. I have observed that a blow inflicted on the insertion of a muscle, or still more of a tendon, is always exceedingly painful: but this painful state, in this case, soon ceases, and the bones unite with simple rest, as the parts are retained in apposition by ojiposing muscles. All bandages are useless, and only add to the distress. Frac- tures of the pubis and ischium, or separation of the sacro-iliac symphysis, are of the gravest kind, and bring with them excruciating sufferings; as, in addition to the injury of the bones, we find perhaps rupture of the bladder, laceration of the urethra, â€™ or other injury to the soft parts. It is rare to see recovery take jjlace when the pelvis is so largely broken. It has been assigned as a reason why the neck of the femur should most readily break in old age, that this part: assumes with the shaft of the bone an angle less oblique than in earlier age. The least knowledge of mechanics falsifies such a notion, in- asmuch as the force effecting the injury, when the

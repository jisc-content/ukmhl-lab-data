SURGICAL PRACTICE. 142 day protrude with such surprising rapidity, that each dayâ€™s work was quite apparent. I have seen the greater part of a tibia, which when once started into the opening, has been quickly and completely extruded. I had a child in the hospital, not long since, about four years of age, in whom the whole femur, from the condyles to the head, came clear away. It is gratifying to see, that as the dead bone jirojects outwards from its case at the one end, so, at the other end, the new bone at once, and ra- pidly, resumes the lessened bulk and form of its proper dimensions. This child, very quickly after the sequestrum was quite discharged, was able to run about the ward. There can be no doubt that there are powerful agents, which can relieve the animal structures, and expel offending bodies without the intervention of muscular motion. We have several analogies in the course of pathological observations that carry with them the truth of this principle. Even in many of the mere exfoliations of bone, where it is well buried in deep parts, the exfoliated portion will rise and appear at the sur- face of the wound. Its presence becomes the sti- mulus for its extrusion, just as the particle of dust from under the eyelid. It is an example of the simple stimulus for rehef. In all the varieties of necrosis, the surgeon is called npon to treat with caution and reserve the case, if he weighs duly his responsibility to the patient. There is a form which sometimes occurs of a te- dious and intractable nature. It is that in which the bone appears outwardly diseased to no great

169 SURGICAL PRACTICE. he is to advert to the construction, and order of the actions, of the rectum. The lower part of this tube is enlarged in a capacious form, which is capable of containing a large quantity of matter, and its capacity seems to increase with age. The presence of the contents is, of course, the stimulus adapted to excite the structure to their expulsion. But the upper part of the rectum is not amenable to this influence for exciting the expulsion of the matter, nor is the sigmoid flexure of the colon; although a stimulus acting on the small intes- tines only, will excite the whole of the large ones to discharge their contents long before the actual exciting substance can reach the lower bowels. The influence of sympathy is probably the cause of this. We find saline purgatives soon after taken will do this, as will the increased flow of bile from the liver. I am convinced that the sigmoid flexure of the colon and the upper part of the rectum may be distended, and yet no effort for the evacuation of the faeces, be made in the lower part. The con- sequence of this is, that these parts being loaded, and subject to the action of the abdominal muscles, have to sustain constant force pressing upon them, so that there is always a tendency in the mem- brane of the rectum to descend in folds, and become loose. This seems the first step that leads to all the annoyances of what are called in- ternal piles. The effect arising from this loose state of the membrane is, that after the efibrt of getting relief of solid dejections, a fold is pro-

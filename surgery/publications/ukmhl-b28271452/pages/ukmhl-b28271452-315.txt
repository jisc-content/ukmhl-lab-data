SURGICAL PRACTICE. 2G1 letting out the contents of chronic abscesses by means of a trocar, and have found a very striking facility take place in healing the aperture, when this in- strument has been employed. We see every day the ready way in which the wounds heal that are made in the linea alba in the operation of paracen- tesis, although the structure is not highly organised. The use of this instrument also causes a stretching of the part of the integument that is punctured, which is favourable for healing. Further, by leaving the fluid to pass through the canula, no flakes nor particles of fat can be interposed in the wound to interfere with the healing. One caution is required in adopting the trocar, which is, that the collection should be large enough to secure the point, when pushed in, from endangering the deep parts. Many cases present themselves at the hospital of small abscesses in the axilla, occurring most com- monly in young females, but occasionally in males. They are circumscribed in form and connection, being bounded by the tough fascia of the part; and on this account are exceedingly painful. They are distinct from those which are the result of inflamed glands, and have no connection with any source of irritation on the fingers. They are from time to time frequently of periodical occurrence, reappear- ing during the course of a few years. They should be opened early, and will do well. A case which often presents itself in the hospital, is a true phlegmonous abscess around the knee. The subjects of it arc always young female servants, who have had to kneel much: yet it is quite dis-

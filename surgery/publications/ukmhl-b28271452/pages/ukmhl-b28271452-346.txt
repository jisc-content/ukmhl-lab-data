SURGICAL PRACTICE. 292 place during the night, the patient finding in the morning his knee very painful and very much en- larged by a rapid secretion from the synovial mem- brane, which is very tense and painful. In this case local bleeding is very advantageous; and, by the ap- propriate treatment for rheumatism, the case usually gets quite well. If the inflammation of serous or synovial membranes is so moderate as only to secrete their proper fluid, the derangement rarely goes so far as to impair the parts seriously. There is also a frequent case where the membrane is largely distended by synovia, which is owing to the presence of an adventitious cartilage or body in the joint; this, although it may be lodged in a steady posi- tion, will, on using the joint much, excite the membrane to secrete largely. A strain of the liga- ments of the joints will also sometimes lead to a large accumulation in the cavity of a joint. If the pain on moving this joint has not been great, and the advance of the complaint has been slow, there will be swelling arising from thicken- ing of the soft parts about it. In this stage the adoption of issues is still, if possible, more called upon, as local bleeding has no influence in acting upon this condition of parts. It is necessary to make one observation on this occasion, which is, that these issues should be successively planted around the joint, as the sphere of the influence of any one does not seem to radiate to the whole extent of the altered parts. The mere thickening is probably not a part of the diseased state of the membrane, but a useful provision for preserving this part from the injury which freedom of motion may impnrt j

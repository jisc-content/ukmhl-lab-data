SURGICAL PRACTICE. 7 B 4 they even did occur, the limbs would suffer but little. In animals that move in the atmosphere, there is little doubt but that the centre of gravity in its bearings is equal to a sense in exciting the muscles for instant action. A very little practice would enable a person to calculate the turnings and the risings and declivities of the road in which he travelled, if he were well exercised in the ba- lancing motions, although he might not see the way; so watchful are the muscles in that system of actions for which they are associated, to meet every contingency of change of position in reference to the centre of gravity. The problem which would assign the influence of health of a person from the conditions of his muscular system, has an extended range for the investigation. The muscular system was con- structed for actions and moving powers more nu- merous and vastly greater than those which are actually presented to us. We never see a man run round a corner at the utmost of his speed, yet his muscular frame is capable of arriving at this power, as weU as that of walking in a straight line. And every internal part must be formed to go on in unison with these varieties, in all the exertions and movements that may possibly occur. Every func- tion of life must be influenced by the full and perfect development of muscular motion. Diseased organs, when present, give a character to the move- ments of the individual in whom they exist. And the converse must be true, that the adoption and perseverance in the exercise and agility of muscular

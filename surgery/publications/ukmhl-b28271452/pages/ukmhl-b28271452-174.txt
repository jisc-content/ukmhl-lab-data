SURGICAL PRACTICE. 120 may heal, as I have once seen it do. When the bone is powerfully forced out through the wound, then so large a laceration of the parts is made, that it is vain to suppose an union any where can be formed in the interior of the wound. In such cases suppuration will ensue, and it is for the benefit of the patient that this process should come on as quickly as possible. In these cases all the contrivances of varnishing the wound are idle, and perhaps worse than useless, as it is a step that may delay the accession of the best process we should hope forâ€”^suppuration. It is then in proportion to the laceration of muscles and by the implication of other structures by the application of the force, that the magnitude of the injury is, in a great degree, to be measured. And if these be many and great, it is quite fruitless to waste ingenuity or time, in contriving means for procuring primary adhesion. In the amputations of limbs I have performed, I have often succeeded, by nice adaptation of the wound, in procuring adhesion; but have not infrequently been disap- pointed by one part of the union soon giving way. There has been that disturbance or violence im- pressed upon the deeper structures, that, whilst union has been going on at the surface, the suppurative process has been established below; and this event will take place in spite of the gentlest offices of careful surgery. It must be much more so, where the great violence inflicted upon the part is ca- pable of breaking a strong bone. And on this account I have said that a large external wound

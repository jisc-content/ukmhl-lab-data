SUKGICAL PKACTICE. 300 tation in the motion of the joint, although produced in the same way, and probably for the same sanatory purpose as in other joints, is not readily made appa- rent, on account of the great capability which the muscles moving the scapula have of compensating for the movements which properly belong to the joint itself.. The first sensation it causes in the joint is a desire to support the arm; and we have in the wast- ing of the deltoid muscle the same flattening of the prominent part of the shoulder which is so striking in the hip. In the latter case we do not find the adduc- tor muscles of the thigh wasted, and likewise in the disease of the shoulder we discover no alteration in the pectoralis and latissimus dorsi, while those muscles connected with the capsule become thin; thus, as it appears to me, showing a provision for pre- serving the articulating surfaces from being rubbed on each other. The great necessity for maintaining the limb in a most perfect state of rest is most ob- vious, by which, and the equally advantageous use of issues, this diseased joint is capable of being restored. I have observed that this affection of the shoulder often occurs at a later epoch in the scrofulous period than that of the hip, or even than the knee. The occurrence of the disease in the elbow joint is more frequent than that of the shoulder; this also presents itself with the same analogies, par- ticularly as to the early setting up of that pro- cess which produces some thickening, by which the limitation- of motion is insured. I have found that the part of this joint which is formed by the radius is more frequently tlie seat of disease than that of

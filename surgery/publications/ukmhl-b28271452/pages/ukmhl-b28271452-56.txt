SURGICAL PRACTICE. 2 part, and also every centre of motion of each in- dividual system, are under the influence of gravi- tation, so no laws can be enunciated respecting the motions of the parts or of the whole, in which the centre of gravity of the animal body is not an essential and primary element. We have in the animal body as many combina- tions of movements, at least, as there are parts fitted for motion. But it is not enough that such a number of parts are formed for motion. Every one motion exercises its power for motion over all the other motions, and therefore every motion adds the sway which it exercises over its own dominions, to the quality of the whole. The subject of association, required in the actions of muscles, has been so little adverted to by phy- siologists, that some further considerations must be dwelt upon for explaining the aids this doc- trine will aflbrd to practical surgery. And it will appear that these aids arise as often from the negation of action, as from the combination of movements. The human frame is constructed as a self-moving machine. But it is not only gifted with the faculty of moving itself, but also with that of preserving its balance under every contingency, by which the force of gravitation can bring danger to it. It has the faculty of varying its movements in every possible way. If we suppose that a body of the figure of a cube be placed on the earth, that point through which a line from the centre of the earth passes to the centre of gravity of the cube, is a point

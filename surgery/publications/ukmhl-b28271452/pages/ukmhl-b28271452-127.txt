73 SURGICAL PRACTICE. influence of the vastus internus, owing to its in- sertions, probably is the best agent to keep the patella in its proper place. But there is a dislocation of the patella of a very different kind. It is when the patella rests in its trochlea, but is turned on its edge; the inner edge is applied to the femur, the outer of course standing out at right angles to it; the upper surface faces the other knee, and the articular surface looks outwards. It might, on first consider- ation, be supposed that a replacement could be readily eflocted; but practically it is a very for- midable undertaking, if the surgeon has not entered into those views I now otfer to the pro- fession, in connection â– with the association under which muscles act. Some years ago, I was called suddenly by a surgeon to assist in reducing a dislocation of this sort; for effecting which, the medical man had resorted to all the various expedients he could contrive for effecting the purpose. I found the patient to be a gentle- man who some years before had, in the common way, dislocated. the patella whilst shooting; and that he had subsequently had the same accident often occur; but now it had become the disloca- tion of the above kind. The surgeon had exhausted his ingenuity: however, we resumed the series of contrivances with all the powers we could exert of lateral pressure on the bone in all directions; but nothing availed; and it seemed to me as firmly fixed in ])osition, as if three or four long screws had been driven through its tliickness, and bound

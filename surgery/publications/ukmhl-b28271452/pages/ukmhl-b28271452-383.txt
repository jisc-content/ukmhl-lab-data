329 SUllGICAL rEACTICE. the female the marked characters discriminating the gonorrhoeal from all other discharges in the beginning of the complaint, is the viscid quality of it, causing the parts to adhere to the clothes. But as this character is soon lost, and the painful sensa- tions subside, it becomes difficult in the latter stage of the complaint in women, to decide when the in- fectious quality of the secretions has ceased to exist. I have known instances, in both sexes, where the quality of infection remained, although the dis- charge was reduced to the least possible quantity. There seems to be, as I have seen reason for sup- posing, in both sexes a state of the structures of some persons that is favourable for keeping up gonorrhoea. In the female wards I have invariably found that women of loose cellular tissues will have the com- plaint linger very long. And in subjects with sandy hair the gonorrhoea is not only more persist- ing, but the affections of the glands more readily run into extensive ulcerations. I may repeat that I have seen cases where the discharge has proceeded uninterruptedly diminishing, and become reduced to the smallest possible cpiantity, and intercourse has communicated the disease.

But if the course of the discharge has ceased, and after an intermission of some days has re-appeared, I am disposed to believe that this renewed secretion will not communicate the disease. The treatment of this complaint seems to rest

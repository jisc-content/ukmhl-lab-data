104 SURGICAL PRACTICE. upon the surgeon ; lie has to detect, if possible, the character of the constitution ; he has to scrutinise the patientâ€™s pulse, not only on the first moment of the injury, but almost every hour, at least at short intervals, to decide its state, and then to decide whe- ther there is action sufficient for the purposes of the coming demands. What he has to wish for and to expect is, that there should be some expression of what is called sympathetic fever. This is really a state that we know indicates a vigorous consti- tution, and one which will, when subdued into tranquillity, best throw out its power for repairing an injury : and so far from being that fever which has been placed as a fearful object in the scene, it is really a hopeful event in the first three days of an injury ; because it assures us of the powerful coadjutor we shall have in all the processes that are to ensue for the benefit of the patient. It is the absence of this excited state in the cir- culation that should alarm the surgeon; it is the weak, the fluttering, unsteady pulse that should impress him with danger, and raise in him the fear that he may expect gangrene or other miseries that may afflict his patient. In all serious injuries the constitution is invaded in proportion to the magnitude of the injury; but the way in which the constitution may meet this invasion is widely different according to its state. The one presents a ready front and encourages a liopeful result 5 another displays its weakness, and calls for the most watchful care. The circum- stances tliat imply health in a general sense arc

74 SURGICAL PRACTICE. it most closely to the femur. All this time we were acting in the falsely received notion of re- laxing muscles by merely keeping their attachments as much as possible approximated to each other, and the leg was most carefully kept extended on the thigh. After a long course of trials in this way, it occurred to me, that I might effect some change by giving the bones a sort of shake; for this purpose I slightly bent the leg, and gave a little rotatory motion to the tibia, when the patella quietly returned to its proper situation, as if a charm had released it from its fixed state. The hand of an infant might now have deposited it in its trochlea. The result of the manipulation in this case led to reflections which opened to my view principles very different from those I had formerly held. It offered a forcible example, that any muscle disturbed in its arrangement is under great excitement to act. The disturbed arrangement here was the elevation of the centre of action of the extensors above the ordinary position ; and as these muscles, in the straight position of the whole limb, are called upon to support a great pro- portion of the weight of the body, so when in that position they are naturally impelled to exert a vast force. But in obedience to the associated action of combined muscles, when the leg is bent, and another order of motions in this complicated joint is brought into play, then these extensor muscles immediately relax; they would otherwise by their action prevent the rotatory motion of the leg upon

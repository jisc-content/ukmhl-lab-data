262 SURGICAL PRACTICE. tinct from inflamed bursa. It spreads around the knee on either side, goes through its stages very quickly, so as to present a fair state of suppura- tion in a few days. It is extremely painful, being under the fascia of the thigh, and requires to be opened as soon as the case is fairly made out. The abscess very quickly heals, and the patient is at once relieved from pain and fever after the evacuation of the pus. I have not been able to connect these cases with any uterine irritation. The inflammation in this case comes on suddenly, and runs its course actively and rapidly ; affording in this instance a proof that the processes of reparation bear a pro- portion in their energy to the activity of the disturbance which has called forth the reparative power. This kind of abscess also points out the fact, that when matter is once produced, even in the most minute quantity, leeches are harmful, as I have very often witnessed, in these cases especially. I have seen their employment in this way cause a dimi- nution of the intensity of the inflammation, and so retard the full development of the abscess, yet not prevent its course, thus robbing the parts of their energies, so that when the matter has been evacuated, the further progress of the abscess has been languid, and very tardy in finally healing. I have invariably noticed the same effect from leech- ing absorbent glands. This .remedy never absolutely stops the formation of matter: it only converts the active into a chronic form of inflammation, and the suppuration lingers in a tedious Torm.^ But there is another objection to leeches applied to

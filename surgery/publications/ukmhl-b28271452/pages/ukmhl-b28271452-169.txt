115 SURGICAL PRACTICE. their feet or hands. In such I have often found that, whilst the surface shows but little appearance of being injured, the deeper parts are most severely suffering. This may well deceive the surgeon. The external marks will of course vary, as the intensity of the injury of the deeper structures; but the strildng symptom is, the degree of pain being so much beyond what might be inferred from the external appearance, more particularly the increase of this pain after the third day. Among the first signs is that which always accom- panies the inflammation of the tarsal and meta- tarsal, or the carpal and metacarpal bones, which is the puffy swelling both above and below, but particularly on the under part, and on those sur- faces where the injury was applied. In these parts we have not only the bones, but a vast collection of fibrous structures of a low organisation; and when these structures are injured, we invariably find this puffy swelling in the part over them. But owing to the circumstance of the low organisation of the parts, we of course find that the advance of the inflammatory action is slower than those of more perfect organisation. Thus we often find in these cases not much to discourage the surgeonâ€™s hopes until the third or fourth day, when the inflammation advances with aggravated pain to the patient, until the powers of the part are over- come, and slough of the surface and destruction of the deeper parts relieve him of these sufferings. I have adduced these cases not only to show that we may be often deceived in the estimate we make

SURGICAL RRACTICE. 66 trochlea, the upper part lying hollow, and thus it gives way to the effort of the muscles. In selecting the best position for the recovery of the injury, of course we should adopt that which can most com- pletely secure the inaction of the muscles inserted into the bone. I believe this object might be very well effected by placing the patient on the side; but as the time required for the treatment is long, and as the position on the back is sufficiently effective, the latter plan is usually adopted. But that the patient may be secured from the injurious effects of forward movements, the whole extremity should be made to form the least possible angle with the trunk; in which position the extensor muscles can only act with great fatigue, and therefore will remain passive. I must observe that I always find that when the fracture is produced by the agency of tlie muscles, it is never in any part lower than the middle line, generally above, and even so much so that a scale only is sometimes broken from the upper edge. But if it is effected by a blow on the part, then it is in the middle, or in the lower half. I have found that short lusty persons are those who more commonly suffer frac- tures of this bone from muscular efforts. In speaking of the position and the security for the repose of all the muscles engaged in the mo- tions of the patella, I have detailed the chief re- quirements, I believe, that the surgeon is called upon to execute. This is an injury of the joint, with consequent effusion into its cavity, the ab- sorption of which forms therefore the first step in

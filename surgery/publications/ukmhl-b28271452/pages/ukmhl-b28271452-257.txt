SURGICAL RRACTICE. 203 also a probe, and transmits to the fingers all the tangible circumstances that may occur in the pas- sage of it. Thus we know best by this the situ- ation and the degree of induration of a stricture, the hardness of the prostate gland, and all the peculiarities that may exist in the entrance of it into the bladder. Therefore at first examinations we are made more familiar with the circumstances of the obstructions when we use the metal instru- ment. The elastic tube, when it has a stitF wire, is inferior by far to the other, for it does not transmit fully the sensations given by the parts to the fingers, and yet it has a degree of rigidity that may readily do mischief without using it with great caution. When, in the case of enlarged prostate, the manipulator is familiar with the course of the passage, then the elastic tube, which retains its curva- ture without the wire, is an admirable instrument, as it may be employed with great ease to the patient. In disease of the prostate, an instrument of as large a diameter as the urethra will admit is best adapted to the case. It is laid down that for this purpose a longer length of instrument is required. This is so far true, because the gland lies higher in the pelvis, as the lateral ligaments of the bladder implicating its structure prevent its descent; and therefore when it is enlarged it must carry the bladder up- wards with it. In irregular stricture the elastic catheter is often best suited for passing, as the evenness of the canal being broken in upon, the fiexibility of its structure alloAvs it to be insinuated in spite of the obstacles ; but the greatest delicacy

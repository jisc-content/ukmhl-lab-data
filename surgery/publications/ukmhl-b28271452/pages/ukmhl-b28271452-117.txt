63 SURGICAL PRACTICE. that accident apply to this. The straight position is to be adopted ; and the parts are to be preserved in all possible quietude. A very careful adjust- ment must be made of the parts, but on no account must pressure be made on the patella. The least irregularity in the relations of parts when united must produce imperfection in the functions of the joint. I believe generally that getting the parts in as nearly correct position as possible, and leaving them in repose, there is a better chance of useful union than by all the contrivances that the sur- geonâ€™s ingenuity can invent. The natural action of the living structures has not only the power of re- storing parts injured, but also of retrieving the impaired functions of them. I do not think that the surgeon can impart any relief to a joint by taking upon himself to be the agent of its motion. Nature does not stamp her assent to this kind of proceeding. In injuries of joints, such as fractures into them, the surgeon is often directed, after a week or so, to adopt passive motion; this he does, and the patient complains of the pain it has left. He repeats the movements, and more pain is inflicted: he now finds less lati- tude of motion in the part. No motion should be allowed until the union is perfect, and not until it can be done Avithout the least pain. There is always a tendency in the conservative process to restore the perfection of a joint; and the efiicacy of this agent can always be relied on Avithout the con- trivance of artificial means. The muscles that move, and the construction of a joint they are de- signed to move, form an integral system; and if

SUUGICAL rKACTICE, 6U fore it is bent, the more their exertions are required : and thus they follow the course appointed for the discharge of their ordinary functions. I believe the position best for the coaptation and quietude of the bones would be for the patient to lie on his abdomen, this being a position in which they are never called upon to act. But the placing the limb on the side prevents it from being unduly acted on by these two muscles. The lying upon the back seems to me the most objectionable, as on the slightest move- ment of any part of the trunk, these muscles are called forth to act. Any one with a sound limb may find this out, as he cannot move even slightly forward, but these muscles are necessary to balance his trunk. In this position on the back also, the sartorius is called into action in'the movement forwards, giving a twist to the lower portion out- wards, in which form the fracture usually unites. As these muscles are engaged in balancing both in the erect and recumbent position, they will be called upon in every change of position to disturb the bones when the patient is on his back. They are not called upon in the lateral movements; at least so few individuals make use of their lateral powers of balancing, that in this posture they are usually inert. In this lateral position the parts are left in quiet repose, and in the best way to help forward the process of union. On the back the least move- ment transmits its impulse to the bones, deranging the adaptation that has been procured. All that has been said in favour of the reasons for preferring the position on the side in the cases considered above, applies equally to fractures of

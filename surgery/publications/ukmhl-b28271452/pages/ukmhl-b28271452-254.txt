Except in children, all the cases of incontinence of urine that I have seen have occurred in persons who have enlarged prostate, and arising, as I con- ceive, in the way explained. They have really been the effect of overflowing of the fluid, when the in- difference to the presence of the urine has reached that degree of distension at which the accustomed quantity has been equal to excite the muscles to expel the fluid. I except cases of paralysis. The treatment of this case of course includes the use of the catheter, as well as in that of retention. In the latter case, by the regular employment of the catheter, Ave find that the muscular structure of the bladder will gradually recover its suscepti- bility to the stimulus of the urine. We find that very soon small quantities of urine begin to be voluntarily expelled, and as the quantity thus evacuated is increased, so the residuum to be drawn off by the instrument lessens. At last if the patient be de- sired to expel the urine before the catheter is intro- duced, there Avill be only a few drops left for that conveyance out. The incontinence of urine offers the same expectation of success from this treat- ment. When the prostate is enlarged, and it becomes inflamed, it usually lasts a certain period before it gets into a quiet state, and as this fit of irritation subsides the patient begins to pass his urine, gra- dually increasing the quantity tliat he expels.

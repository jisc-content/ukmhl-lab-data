The periosteum is, as I have before said, that struc- ture to which we mainly owe the power of repairing the injury of broken bone; and in compound frac- ture, we have the opportunity not only of witnessing the change in its condition, but also the happy re- sults of such changes. All that is admirable in the series of changes in the gravid uterus, or, what is more to the j)urpose, those of that order of things which is so striking in the formation and the shed- ding of the deciduous horns in the deer kind, is, if any thing, still more remarkable in the series of changes and succession of functions which the peri- osteum can take on. The film-like membrane, the periosteum in its natural state, appearing to be of low organisation — so low in sensation that it hardly shows signs of feeling in amputation, when the stimulus for repair is brought into full opera- tion by the subsiding of all derangements into the orderly course of new functions—is then en- dowed with the power of passing into one of the most exquisitely organised structures of the body. It is then highly vascular, and acutely sensitive, and fleshy in its substance. It is now abounding with life, and full of activity for the purpose for which it has passed into this state. When the surgeon is thus aided by this astonishing machi- nery, he is imperatively called upon to do all he can to keep up its productive energy, and he is to do

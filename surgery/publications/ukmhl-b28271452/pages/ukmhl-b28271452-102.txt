SURGICAL PRACTICE. 48 more harm than use, if applied over the fracture, as it presses on the injured parts, without having any support from other parts. If applied over the upper ribs only, it may have good etfect. I have had several cases of fracture of the sternum : occasionally it has been broken in a way to leave no depression of any amount, and without fracture of the ribs. These cases have done well; but where they have presented a considerable de- pression, and one or more ribs have been broken, the cases have been fatal. A correct mechanical investigation of the power of muscular structure to resist the sudden appli- cation of violence, might prove that the resistance of a muscle in action is little less than that of hard matter. In the passage of shot we know how readily this structure deflects balls; and I have been called upon to reflect on the impunity often displayed in the way the wheels of carts, &c., have passed over the abdomen of both children and adults. These (often certain, and sometimes only reputed, cases) are continually occurring in the hospital, and they generally excite no anxiety after the first few days, if no viscus appears to be ruptured, nor hemor- rhage produced. In connection with the subject of the qualities of muscles, I have to observe, that in wounds of the walls of the abdomen, where the three layers of muscles have been divided, I have always found that a ventral hernia has followed ; at least, the structure which supplies the place of the loss of muscular fibre was unable to resist the pressure from within. lArhaps in this result, we have an analogy in

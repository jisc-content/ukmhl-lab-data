81 SURGICAL PRACTICE. the limb were an isolated part of the body, that is, if it were under no influences external to itself, it probably would suffer no disturbance in the pro- gressive advance to ossification. Any tendency to displacement by the muscles of the limb only would soon be adjusted by the power of accommodation going on for the first few days; and the advantage in this case would be, that when the bones were united, the muscles would be in the best possible state to render the leg at once useful. But we must not regard the leg as a separate part, uninflu- enced by other agents. It is under the influence of the whole muscular system of the body, and every movement of any one part may derange the proper position of the limb. Therefore when the patient is on his side there is less of this associated influence to disturb the order of the position than on his back; though still on the side some assistance is required from mechanism to maintain the limb quiet. It is only in the very first period of the treatment that the muscles are disposed to disturb the adjustment of the bones. If the limb be kept in its natural ar- rangement, the muscles soon resume their original association, and leave the bones quite undisturbed. A necessary part of the treatment is, that for the first fortnight the limb should be daily inspected, and any little derangement rectified: however re- fractory the muscles may be at first, they soon relapse into quietude, and admit readily a right arrangement. I have formerly seen, in times when it was the usage of surgeons to keep their cases a very long time in bed, a patient with a broken leg, G

The process of healing went on in the stump, but the power of her stomach never came round : she had really never any appetite in spite of the usual administration of tonics and stimuli, with the trial of every kind of diet. She died with the stump covered with a delicate cicatrix. The tongue was not amiss, but the pulse gradually became weaker, until it could not be felt.

Great local injuries produce great general disturbances, and thus there arises a state of the constitution for the grave consideration of the surgeon. This has been called the power of the shock upon the nervous system. The death of infants occurs from teeth- ing sometimes. The surgeon knows that infants will sometimes die immediately after operations. The brain sulFers quickly from local irritation at this period of life ; and if the brain suffers, all the secretions at once are altered, and a fatal reci- procity of influences is established, so as to destroy life. In infancy there is the greatest development most actively going on, and therefore there must be the greatest injury sustained by any infractions of these powers. This is an age when the disturbance of the combination of the manner, of the order, and of the measure of functions, acts most power- fully on the integrity of the Avhole system. In children we have the means of keeping that irri- tation off which depends upon the disordered se-

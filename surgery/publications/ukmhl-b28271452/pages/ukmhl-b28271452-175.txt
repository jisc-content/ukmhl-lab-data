SURGICAL PRACTICE. 121 does not necessarily increase the difficulties of the case. An obvious element in estimating the powers of nature for repair, in cases of compound frac- ture, is the extent of injury done to the peri- osteum. It is this structure on which we repose our confidence for the restoration of the bone to its functions in the economy of the limb. If this is seriously injured, the reparative processes for placing the bone in a restored state are de- fective, perhaps lost. The extent and numbers of the future exfoliations wiU be probably regu- lated by the primary injury the bone receives. If we have an uninjured periosteum, with good surgery the recovery will go on well, when once the reparative processes have commenced, and if the constitution of the patient be moderately tranquil, and not absolutely depressed. In cal- culating the powers of the periosteum in this case, we view one of the most splendid endowments of the animal structures. We see that a colourless membrane, almost without feeling, may at another time, being the very same tissue, become most vascular, and therefore most acutely sensitive. It is converted from a thin transparent film into a fleshy substance of the highest order of vitality, throwing forth the most active powers for the formation of new bone. As in cases of necrosis, so in fractures we discover that this is the character it assumes. I have many times in comminuted fractures seen pieces of loose bone where the pe- riosteum was left sound, connecting them to each

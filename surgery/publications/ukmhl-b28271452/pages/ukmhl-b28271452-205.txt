151 SURGICAL PRACTICE. takes on a sloughing form when excited, imposes a serious responsibility on the surgeon whenever the fascia is interested in the operations he undertakes. I have seen a simple and small incision into it lead to a considerable loss of it; and have known cases where a long, incision has been carried through it, in the management of phlegmonous erysipelas, cause the loss of it in the whole of one side of the leg. I was called upon, not long ago, to give an opinion in such a case, in which the tendons of the peronei muscles and the extensars of the toes Avere laid quite bare. These structures preserved their vi- tality, and would have been efficient for their in- tended motions, if they had the covering of fascia; but without this, they, in the healing of the sore, formed one mass with the uniting medium, and Avere of course fettered by the cicatrix. Cases occasionally occur of a chronic form of diseased fascia, which is generally seen about the upper jDart of the thigh on the outer side. The cha- racter they present is that of thickening not only of the fascia, but of the integument over it, with ulceration, to a small extent, of the cutis, in which there are sinuses leading ^doAvn to the diseased structure, Avhich is felt by a probe to be thickened and rough, and offering no sign of bleeding, how- ever roughly the exploration may be carried on, and the sinuses themselves secrete hardly any thing, and what they may do is not pus. These are ob- stinate cases: of course the sinuses Avill not heal Avhilst there is disease at the bottom. The really efficacious treatment is the division of the thickened I. 4

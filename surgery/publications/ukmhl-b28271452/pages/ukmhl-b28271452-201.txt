SURGICAL PRACTICE. 147 riencecl the great relief from the preceding inci- sions, he begged to have these divided. This was done, and they all quickly healed; and in less than a fortnight he left the hospital quite well. This is essentially an alteration in the structure of the periosteum only, the bone merely suffering by implication. When theâ€™ extent of the altered periosteum is of large breadth, then the bone loses, in some parts, its vitality. If, on the one hand, the general feature of the injury is not to injure the bone j)rimarily, so, on the other, I have not seen these cases occur when blows were accom- panied by wounds; so that the force which effects the mischief seems to expend its power upon the periostemn. We have frequent instances of ob- serving that, in the infliction of injuries on the body, the impetus of the force may be expended on different structures lying in the line of the direction of the force, and not necessarily on all, or any one especially. The state of a living structure lying loosely over dead or inactive subjacent parts, as it occurs in practice, always gives rise to great pain; and as it is a pain not arising from actions calculated for relief, and for the restoration of the part, so it is a pain remarkably oj>pressive and injurious to the whole system. I have often seen living cutis vera lying loose over inert sores, very painful; by dividing this isthmus of skin passing over and stretched across, the pain instantly has ceased. So a piece of skin merely lying over a part of necrosed tibia, has been relieved from all pain by

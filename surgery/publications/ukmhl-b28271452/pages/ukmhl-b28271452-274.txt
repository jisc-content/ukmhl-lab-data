SURGICAL PRACTICE. 220 sure ; but even this pressure should be confined as much as possible to the bleeding orifice. An extension of this principle has enabled me to carry out the plan so as to arrest the bleeding from arteries of tolerable size, such as the superficialis vola3 and the superficial palmar arch. The practice I adopt is to use a hard boss of lint, larger than that for leech bites, but yet not more so than to cover fully the bleeding artery, to clear all coagu- lum away, and then press this boss upon the artery. As we are to get the elastic power of the integu- ments to keep up unremitted pressure, it will be necessary that this boss should have other pads placed over it, when it lies below the level of the surrounding parts, in order that the pressure may take effect. But in this instance there is no other application to be made, except upon this very spot over the artery; the rest of the wound ought not to be closed in, and no other covering except a piece of lint laid loosely on it; the lips of the wound are , not to be brought together, nor is the j^ressure of bandages to be used. When suppuration has fairly taken place no further bleeding will ensue, and the pressure may be taken off. Security has so certainly followed this plan of treatment, that I have the fullest confidence in it. Allowing the object to be fully obtained, it is a striking advantage over other methods that are usually had recourse to. All sur- geons must have had the opportunity of seeing the clifficulty and tediousness of securing the cut ends of the superficial palmer arch, and we know of the ex- traordinary propositions that have been followed

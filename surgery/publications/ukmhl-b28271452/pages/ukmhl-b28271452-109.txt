SUEGIGAL PEACTICE. 5b outer part of the thigh laterally, the bone is then driven into the obturator foramen. This happens to excavators who, when digging, have had the earth fall in upon them. As far as I have been able to observe, the dislocation which leaves the head of the bone on the pubis is the result of some force, which acts by rotating the bone upon its axis outwards, turning the head inwards with force enough to rupture the capsular ligament on the inner side. When we view the variety and the complications of the motions of the hip-joint, and calculate the pressure of the weight of the body, under which these delicate movements are to take place, and particularly the strength of the adductor muscles, which is required for preserving the trunk in the line of gravity, we see that a larger range of mus- cular associations is broken up in this dislocation than in the same injury of other joints. It is by the resistance muscles exert in opposing the means used in reduction of dislocations, that we may infer the immense power they possess when acting in combination about a joint. I have seen, in the employment of the extension for reduction, the force continued long and power- fully after the bone was restored ; yet this did not re-dislocate the bone, nor at all draw it from the socket. But I fully think it true that the muscles will not offer an effectual obstacle to the bringing the bone down to a proper position for the purpose of reduction, and that the difficulty occurring in luxations does not arise from want of

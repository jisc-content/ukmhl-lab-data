218 SURGICAL PRACTICE. most part they have only done what bare exposure will generally effect; if the blood be carefully re- moved, and the styptic be applied, it has the credit of supporting its character, but generally, if the blood be removed and kept from forming a coagulum, the vessels will cease bleeding, as the effect of the mere exposure of the part. The doctrine explaining the use of plugs of coagulum about an artery, to re- strain its bleeding, was never to me very con- vincing. I know practically that arteries of a con- siderable size, such as those about the hand, of the size even of the radial, will cease to bleed if left quite exposed, and kept freed from the formation of coagulum taking place about them ; so, when the socket of a tooth bleeds, if it be kept quite clear of coagulum, and the oil of turpentine be applied, it will succeed in quickly arresting the bleeding. I have every reason to feel assured, from what I have tried in these cases, that the bleeding may be stopped in epistaxis upon these principles, by which the patient may be saved from the annoyance of what is called plugging. The plan of the proceed- ing that I have adopted is to keep the parts which are bleeding freed from all coagulum, and this should be done in this case by syringing the nostrils, so as to wash the blood out. Now if a styptic be used, such as the sulphate of zinc, it co- agulates the blood as it issues from the vessels, and so far stops the bleeding; but there is a process going on, by which this clot is loosened from its adhesion, and, perhaps, on the second day the bleeding is renewed. This will happen repeatedly;

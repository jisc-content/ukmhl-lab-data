83 SURGICAL PRACTICE. G 2 be sufficiently broad, so that the straps should not at all press upon the soft structures. The straps should be strong, of good web, and the buckles well made. Two are all that are wanted in the leg, as such an apparatus as I have described keeps the whole limb in the most perfect state. As for the purpose of inspection the upper splint has often to be removed, and as it cannot be done too gently, the employment of buckles will jar the part much less than any other contrivance. The causes of the various and numerous fractures of the leg brought into St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital may be arranged under a few distinct heads in re- gard to the mode of the infliction of the injury. First, a considerable force may be applied directly to the part fractured, as in the passage of a vehicle over the limb. This mode of inflicting the injury is attended by one circumstance, which is, that owing to the contusion of the muscles the bones are less liable to displacement by muscular action, but the process of union is sometimes tardy. The examina- tion of the limb does not give the sensation of cre- pitus. The kind and degree of injury of the bone must vary according to the place where the force is applied. Thus in the upper part of the limb, where the bones are more covered with muscles, they sustain less violence than nearer the foot, where the bones by lying hollow when on the ground are more liable to be splintered and shattered by the incumbent pressure. In tliis part of the limb these injuries are commonly compound fractures. Another mode in which tlie

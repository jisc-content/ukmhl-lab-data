90 SURGICAL PRACTICE. produced by a crushing of the parts, and therefore come under another division of injuries. Occasionally we have simple fractures of the tibia which extend into the joint: in these cases the bone is, as it Avere, slit upwards, separating the internal malleolus from its shaft. These re- quire no other treatment than that of the above case; but it is right to enjoin the young surgeon that the utmost care should be taken that the foot be retained in a perfect state of repose, which can be hardly done upon an inclined plane; and therefore the lateral position is the only one that should be adopted in these cases. Many cases occur Avhere the metatarsal bones are broken. A Aveight falling on the upper part of the foot is the common cause: it is detected by a nice tracing of the bones. The patient of course must suffer greatly, as it is only a great force that can break bones so constructed to resist injuries, and consequently the contusion is great. No apparatus is required, as the bones are readily retained in position, and the pressure only adds to pain. The phalanges of the toes are occasionally dis- located : and the manipulation for reducing them is not by poAverfully pulling on the displaced bone, but by bending it, and adroitly turning it into its place. In short, the same management that I have proposed for the reduction of the phalanges of the fingers is to be folioAved for the reduction of the bones of the toes. Females are very apt, in falling backAvards, to

SUKGICAL PRACTICE. 57 In old, if not even in recent luxations, tlie traction should not be from one fixed point, but in such a way that the direction may be changed, so that if the joint be taken as a centre, the extremity of the drawing power may move in all directions. In old cases it will be proper that the traction should be changeable in its direction, and that whilst the bone is being drawn down, it should be carried across the body, and a gentle eversion given to the limb, by which the reduction will probably be completed. There are grounds for inferring that this might effect the intention, from the success that has fol- lowed the plan in old luxations of the shoulder, where the great force used in recent accidents is not necessary. But I have not had the opportunity of putting the plan in execution in an old luxation of the femur. It has been attempted to define clearly the period beyond which attempts for reduction of the femur should not be resorted to. I think there is fallacy in these calculations. There are, no doubt, limits for these trials. But I have no doubt that if at any reasonable time a replacement can be made, the patient will have a chance of recovering a very useful joint, and will be much better off than if the bone had been left displaced. What are called luxations of the head of the femur into the ischiatic notch are rare. I am apt to think they should be described merely as a variety of the displacement of the head of the bone upon the dorsum ilii. They present less marked features to assist in the diagnosis, and offer more impediments in the facility of reduction than tlie

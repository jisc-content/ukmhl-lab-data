SUEGICAL PRACTICE, 11 is to be constantly attended to in practical surgery. It is, that tbe relaxation of muscles is to be effected by attending to their position when they are re- quired to throw out their strongest exertions; and not, as usually is supposed, by approximating their attachments. It is a fact we might almost expect, as the result of the powerful influence of association under which they act, and which, whilst this combination exists, regulates the exercise of their forces. Thus the powerful gastrocnemius muscle exerts its greatest strength when, in pro- gression, it is acting to advance the body forward, by throwing its weight upon the toes or metatarsal part of the foot. To do this the foot is extended, which is the same thing as approximating the at- tachments of the muscle. Now, that case which is called dislocation of the foot backwards, and in which the tibia is presenting in front of the astra- galus, offers an exemplification of this position. Of course the gastrocnemius has its lever of action increased in power as the foot lies extended, by the heel projecting so much behind, which advan- tage, joined to that of its habitual exertion when in this direction, forms very great opposition to the foot being brought to a flexed position ; but yet this is not ditficult, and the surgeon will sensibly feel the cessation of its action, the moment it is brought to a right angle with the axis of the tibia. This is omng to its being then in a state of least action, in the usual exercise of its powers. An- other exemplification is that of the fracture of the humerus just below the attachment of the deltoid

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 248 deed produce death to the part it touches, but its consequences otherwise are of a less magnitude: it falls upon the part, but its weighty quality prevents its dwelling more than an instant on it; the contact, is momentary, and the de- structive matter only touches the living parts to start away. It does enough to produce a slough of the surface, but its deadly influence goes no deeper. Thus this sort of burns does not leave the evil consequences which arise from the altered condition of the tissues beneath the skin. When the slough is cleared away, they heal with a small cicatrix, and leave no obstruction to the use of the parts. Another kind of burns that present themselves are those occasioned by persons subject to fits, or who are idiots, falling upon the fire. I have had many of these cases, and not unfrequently a repetition of the same accident in the same individual. This mode of application of the heat here produces a greater degree of mischief than the last, since the contact of the heated body with the parts is of longer duration, although the heat may be below that of melted metal. These burns produce that altered state of the parts beneath the integuments, which I shall now allude to, as giving to the injury a character that we do not observe in many other large sores. The great peculiarity, in the large sores produced by burns, will be found to arise from the radiating property of heat. The intensity of the radiating lieat being in proportion to the distance from the

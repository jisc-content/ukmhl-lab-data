250 SURGICAL PRACTICE. the slough has come away, as the subjacent parts do not participate in the irritation of the caustic, so as to produce thickening, the sore gapes and opens to the extent which the elastic quality of the integu- ments will allow; and if it were permitted at once to heal, as the skin is not bound down by any thick- ened structure under it, it would contract into the most trifling scar; the medium that closes the wound is absorbed almost as fast as the cicatrix is formed. I have had many immensely large phage- daanic sores forming about the groins and thighs, arising from that state of diseased skin which so often takes place after buboes. This disease does not seem to involve the tissues under the skin ; and although the sores themselves may have been very extensive, yet on healing they leave but a com- paratively small cicatrix. The fact is, that when the dead part of the integument is thrown ofl*, we find no thickened or altered state of the parts un- derneath, by which the edges are left, as it were, free to yield to the extensile quality of the skin, and thus is produced a greater breadth of sore than the mere loss of integument would indicate; and, on the other hand, when the medium of granula- tions is formed by the progressive and rapid con- traction of the healing, the edges are made to approximate so as to leave a very small scar. Some years ago I had a gentleman under my care with most extensive mischief of this sort. The sore was of an immense size, extending from the groin round the inner part of the thigh to the nates, in such a way as to incline one to suppose

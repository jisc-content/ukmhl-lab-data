3 SURGICAL PRACTICE. in the base, which, of all points, is really that alone which can support it, if every other part of the base were removed. This small portion might support the cube, whilst the body was kept quiet and equably poised. But it could not resist shocks, nor the least impression made on it to disturb its equilibrium. The least deviation would make it totter, and overthrow it. But, for the purposes of existence, we must sup- pose even a living mass of this shape to be accom- modated with muscles, not only to poise itself on the small point, but also to be able to contend with every impulse from without. It is obvious, from this limited view of the con- ditions required, that in the multiplicity of changes such a body is exposed to in its movements, the intention cannot be effected by one, or even several agents. Not only are numerous muscles called upon to act, but they are to act by a perfect as- sociation and consentaneity of action, in order that the movement may be effected with electrical cele- rity and undeviating precision. It must be re- membered, that in the combination of the moving parts of the machine, the variations that may take place in the least part will vary the whole. The change in the movement of a finger has really and strictly an influence upon the whole body. The most profound wisdom could alone adjust all the complications of the associations required in the movements of the animal machine. These combined forces, associated for consen- taneous action, alive to the impulse which danger, B 2

113 SURGICAL PRACTICE. where the parts suiter immensely, but the system is not powerfully assailed, and called upon to ex- hibit the condition of its powers. In the very many severe contusions which occur at St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital, when the integuments are entire, I have found the influence upon the constitution to be very much less than where there are wounds, although the extent and the violence inflicted are the same. Thus I have seen a limb severely contused, and all the muscles exceedingly bruised, yet the system has been but little disturbed, and rest has been sufficient, with very little other treatment, to restore not only the part, but the general state. Every now and then, I have had cases where the wheel of a vehicle has gone over the thigh, and produced immense swelling, the fascia lata being distended to the utmost; of course the pain has been excessive, and the whole aspect of the limb has been most formidable. I have concluded that these were cases where veins had been ruptured, upon observing the progress of the first three days. The patient suffers much pain, but yet the pulse is neither indicative of great loss of blood, nor of any great excitement. Often, on the second day he has some relief; and on the third day he is decidedly better, the pain is much less, the pulse quiet, he has slept, and the state of the limb is relieved of the great tension. The ruptured veins having poured out blood enough to distend the fascia, the pressure thus produced is sufficient to close their openings permanently; and as no more blood is effused, the absorbents soon diminish the bulk of I

EXPLANATION OF THE DIAGRAMS, 859 Fig. 5. is intended to give some notion, although a very im- perfect one, of the different effects of the diaphragm arising from its iDeculiar arched form. The difference in the curva- ture of its fibres in various parts, must necessarily propagate very different forces to some of its parts than it does to others. Where the perpendiculars to tangents are directed most thickly, at that spot the action of the muscle will be exerted most powerfully.

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 159 cularly of diverting the actions from the diseased to the sanatory state, and of thus relieving the system of its embarrassed condition. I have had many opportunities of treating those previous abscesses from which fistulas in ano are formed. In that mass of adipose substance filling up the ischio-coccygeal space, the patientâ€™s notice is perhaps drawn to a deep tumor, just differ- ing in substance enough to be clearly distinguish- able from the surrounding structure, of a doughy consistence, little sensible, and not at all rising to the level of the surface. This is, I apprehend, the first abscess in its earliest state, whieh, if allowed to go on, will end in the genuine fistula in ano. I have had such cases in the hospital, and have no doubt that this is the fact, as I have compared these sort of swellings with other presentations in a more advanced stage in the formation of fistulas. The practice to be adopted is unhesitatingly pointed out: this lumpy mass is to be transfixed; and this I have done the very first moment the case has been presented to me. I plunge a knife down to the very centre of the mass, and then I have found a small quantity of pus come out; and upon pass- ing my finger down (and the opening should always be large enough to admit this part), I have found in the centre of the mass a small cavity, of the peculiar pulpy feel that is familiar to surgeons as the interior of an abscess. This prompt measure stops all further progress of the abscess, which otherwise would lead its way either to the rectum or to the surface, and terminate in fistula. The

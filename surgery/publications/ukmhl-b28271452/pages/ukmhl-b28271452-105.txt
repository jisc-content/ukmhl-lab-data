SUEGICAL rEACTICE. 51 break liis thigh ; on the same principle the elderly female breaks some part of the femur. The first efi'ect of this injury is the inability of moving the limb, particularly in the forward move- ment, the most practised one. The necessary asso- ciation of the action of muscles is broken up, and their power over the joint has ceased. The second efiâ€™ect is its dropping outwards, owing to the Avhole weight of the limb being outside the axis of the bone as the patient lies in bed. But how does it happen, that, as all the powerful muscles are calcu- lated to draw the limb upwards, there is at first hardly any appreciable shortening ? If muscles were always disposed to draw up parts when all resistance is removed, we ought to see more marked shortening. The limb is not shortened to the full extent of which the muscles are capable, and it often happens that this symptom is not appa- rent at first, but only after the expiration of some days. I am speaking of the case where the injury is actually at the neck. It is not usual to detect what is called crepitus in this case ; the displace- ment is little, and on moving the limb, the head, although severed from the shaft, yet moves on its own centre. In order to state clearly my views of the proper treatment of this injury, I must observe, that, if we were to rest on those methods that would result from the appreciation of all the conditions of the case, we should be l)affled by that state which age usually brings with it, the defect in the poAvers to support long and continued pressure We have a weighty

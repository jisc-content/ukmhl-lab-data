65 SURGICAL PRACTICE. usually require little treatment otlierwise than the observance of position; which should be on the side, as in this state the ligaments are under no restraint, it then is in a position in which the tibia can rotate on its axis. I consider it a principle in treating injuries of joints, where there is fracture into them, that in general, the best position is that in which the appropriate actions can be exercised if neces- sary, which motions may often be used without damage; indeed this little interference with ["the quiet state of the parts is very likely to call forth the powers for preserving the function of the structure. In most of the cases I have had, the restoration of the ligaments has been imperfect, and therefore the limb has been disabled by its inability to become a firm pillar when straight. I had a patient in the hospital, who had only the internal lateral ligament ruptured. It produced great deformity on the first appearance, with a tucking in of the integuments over the joint: this seemed to arise from the pressure of the atmosphere. Of course the deficiency of the ligament allowed great latitude in rotating the tibia on its axis, The joint was readily restored to its proper re- lations by flexing the leg on the thigh, and keeping it quiet on the side. No apparatus was used; and the case did quite well. The greater number of fractures of the patella are produced by the sudden effort of the muscles to preserve the balance of the body, when it is in danger of falling backwards. In this po- sition the patella is not Avholly supported in its r

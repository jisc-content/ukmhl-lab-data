180 SURGICAL PRACTICE. on the other hand, the mere act of distending a stricture really excites an irritation in the part that adds to the mischief. Even if no other than a fine bougie be daily passed, the patient will continue to improve, although the size be not increased. It is, indeed, upon the principle of the associations of actions in certain parts of the urethra that these sort of strictures are cured. Moreover, I have ob- served, that when it has seemed proper to increase the size of the bougie, that on the first use of this larger one, the patient has not felt so well as be- fore ; but again feels his improvement go on as long as the same size is continued. By these gentle means I have no doubt, from what I have seen, that this class of strictures is best, most safely, and most permanently cured; that irritation, which has called into action associated derangements, being thus removed. But the influence goes beyond the first stricture I have now spoken of; for if this has existed some time, and advanced so far as to have formed a per- fect contraction, there is then another formed in a part anterior to the other, as is well known to sur- geons; and if a bougie larger than that which would be used for the posterior stricture be taken, the tube is found obstructed at about four inches down. Now as this is the sequence of tlie other stricture, and as both are formed in unvarying- places in the urethra, and botli relieved by passing the bougie to the utmost extremity of the tube, they both must arise from some peculiar state arising out of the endowment implanted in the part near the

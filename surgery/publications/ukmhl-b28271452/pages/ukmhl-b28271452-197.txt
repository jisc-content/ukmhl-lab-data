The disease will go on in this course for years, and present none of the salutary processes for re- storation to health. As the pain continues unin- terrupted the patientâ€™s constitution suffers after some time. Cases occur where the effect of periostitis has been to leave the necrosed bone under a different condition to that of a complete incasing of the dead portion. The cases I allude to are when the disease has its seat in a considerable portion of the pos- terior aspect of the femur or tibia, which are dis- covered by the probe completely deprived of perios- teum ; this membrane not seeming to take on the processes necessary for the formation of the bony case, but remaining unchanged and inactive in its powers. The provision of leaving openings for the escape of matter is maintained by the formation of sinuses through the fascia and integuments. The front aspect of the bone, or the opposite one to the diseased, is thickened and increased in bulk, in order to keep up the strength of its structure. As the dead bone does not become encased by a new formation, so the excitement to throw off this part is probably less: the period at which it is got rid of, is, as far as I have observed, very uncertain. I believe that

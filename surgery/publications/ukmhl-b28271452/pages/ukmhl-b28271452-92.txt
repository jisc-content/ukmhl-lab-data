38 SURGICAL PRACTICE. of the bone. They are involved in the slight inflain- mation and effusion of lymph consequent to this injury, and only require the injurious influence of pressure to become adherent to the surrounding parts, and then they are made useless in their func- tions ; and probably the nerves going to the hand have the same cause for being affected. The appa- ratus that maybe employed in this fracture should be so adjusted as to make no pressure over the broken parts of the radius. After a long time the hand is restored to its uses. I have observed a great proportion of women amongst those who apply with this injury. Occasionally luxations at the wrist-joint present themselves. I believe the most common form to be that in which the carpal bones are thrown backwards. The carpal flexors are put into strong action in falling, as naturally must be the case, when the palm is downwards, so that any force coming upon the carpal bones nearer the joint than the insertion of the flexor muscles, would force this part of the joint backwards. The displacement is not great, and there is very little derangement in the way the muscles are associated, so that they offer no obstacle to reduction. This is so easily done, that the parts often fall into their position before the surgeon sees the case. The importance of the case rests upon the necessity of keeping, for a long time, the joint motionless. This luxation may occur, and the lateral ligaments not be ruptured; in which case there will be more difficulty in reducing the parts. This is to be

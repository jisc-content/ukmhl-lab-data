A striking feature in this case is the mobility of the limb, which can be rotated easily on its axis. It lies parallel to the other limb, and is little varying from it in length. The position of the head is not so easily detected as it might be suspected would be the case. AVe have in this dislocation but little derangement of the asso- ciation of the muscles that move the bone from that which occurs when they act on the natural centre of motion; therefore but little manipulation is neces- sary. It is only necessary in reducing it to draw the head a little from the pubis, and to direct it to the situation of the acetabulum, when it will be restored. I had not long ago a child of five years of age with this luxation, in whom the head pressed upon the bone just below the inferior spinous process of the ilium: a short and easy manipulation readily reduced the luxation. The dislocation of the head of the femur into the obturator foramen is rare; but I have seen such cases. The straggling posture it gives to the bmb marks the case. In this luxation the limb is fixed. The same principle obtains in the reduction of this displacement as in all the others, that of drawing out the bone, and then directing the head to the centre of the acetabulum. To fulfil the directions given in these cases, of course the traction should not be fixed in one point, but in a way that the direction of it may be varied. As in this case the head of the bone is more removed from the centre, around which

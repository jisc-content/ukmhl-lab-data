SURGICAL PRACTICE. 277 T 3 taken. I think I may say that I have hardly ever seen a case of inflamed gland where suppuration did not ultimately take place after leeches had been applied. They relieve the pain and, perhaps, the swelling for a few days, when both the surgeon and the patient rejoice in this apparent benefit, which it is concluded has been produced by them ; but in a very short time the progress of the case shows that it is pertinaciously advancing to suppu- ration. The fact is, the leeches serve to lower the intensity of the action, and to slacken the pro- gress the case is making; but they have no power to stop the work of nature. When the efforts of living parts have been roused to fulfil well and speedily the perfection of a process, it must probably be injurious to the success of the case to have such useful activity checked or disturbed, and thus cause the further stages to progress only with languor. The local treatment of glands when inflamed should be most carefully to avoid every thing that can irritate the surface. The soothing influence of warm water is most likely to prevent the establishment of the suppurative stage, and nothing but soothing means are required. I have before alluded to the fact that inflammation of scrofulous glands does not seem to make the great impression on the general health that other similar aflections do. This is probably on account of the scrofulous mani- festations being associated with the functions of life, of which association we have strong evidence in the existence of serious scrofulous diseases of

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 150 in the first stage, like that of all deep fibrous struc- tures, produces a blush on the surface; and when this occurs, although no other symptom presents itself, the formation of matter under it may be calculated upon. In the slightest injuries of this part, the strongest injunction should be given that the limb should be preserved perfectly motionless. I have seen the point of a penknife, by falling out of the hand of the patient and puncturing the fascia in so slight a way that he was careless about it, and walked as usual, afterwards lead to a lengthened confinement to the bed. It has occurred to myself, after the removal of a bursa from over the patella, that the fascia of the thigh was invaded by the most violent inflammation, terminating in sloughing and extensive suppurations, with the most intense pain; altogether producing a state that endangered the life of the patient. I have been witness to a case in which death did follow the removal of an old bursa, the operation having been quickly followed by the inflammation of the fascia. In the most moderate form of inflammation of the fascia, the suppurative process is always likely to follow; and as this inflammation always takes place on its internal surface, there may follow ad- hesions which will cause imperfections in the motions of the limb. But these will not last long, for the pro- vision for securing the functions of structures pro- vides a still delicate tissue to alloAV the muscles free play. The knowledge of the fact, that so important a part in the economy of muscular action readily

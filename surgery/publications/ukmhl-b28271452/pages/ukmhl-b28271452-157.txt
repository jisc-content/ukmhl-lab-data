103 SURGICAL RRACTICE. cretions. No operation slioulcl be performed on them without immediately emptying the bowels. If two children, the one weakly and the other robust, are both vaccinated, we find, casteris paribus, that the development of the disease, which is, in fact, the measure of the powers that respond to stimuli, bears a close analogy with the consti- tutional vigor of each; thus the inflammatory appearances of the areola and the fever in this stage being much greater in the robust than in the other. These analogies are so obvious and 'SO consonant with our notions, that in aU injuries, taking along with us the quality of the injury, we may assume that the vivacity of the excitement caused by the local disturbance is a measure of the vigor of the constitution. But in proportion to the vigor of the constitution, so is the power of resisting the changes which local disturbances can effect upon the whole. The vigorous system will be excited into more active exertions, because it has a quicker and a steadier power for effecting re-ad- justment. But if, on the other hand, the constitution does not respond with vigor, the vital energy being too low to exert necessary action, and to resist the first invasion, it will probably be powerless to fulfil all the purposes of restoration. These are principles in surgical practice to be borne in mind in settling the points whether a patient with com- pound fracture is or is not to be bled; whether cases of veiy great injuries to the limbs do or do not require amputation upon the instant, &c. In these grave cases an imperative duty devolves II 4

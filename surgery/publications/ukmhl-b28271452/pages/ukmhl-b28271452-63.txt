9 SURGICAL PRACTICE. As a striking instance of the importance of keep- ing in view the power of the centre of gravity over the muscular mechanism of the human body, and also of the value of investigating the qualities of the associations of muscles, I shall allude to the muscular structure of the lower extremity in a very slight way. The situation of the centre of gravity is placed at a point, the vertical line of which falls between the two lower extremities, and as the whole weight of the body is concentrated in this point, so to prevent its pressing downwards, and forcing its way between the thighs, it is required that there should be powerful muscles, not only to keep the limbs together, but that in progression this weight might be thrown to each side, as the steps are made in advancing. The adductors keep the legs from flying asunder, and preserve the centre of gravity in its changing position. But these are always sufficiently engaged in these great exertions; and there are many and delicate mo- tions required in progression which demand other agents; these are the many small muscles about the joint. But even these would be useless if the inser- tion of the triceps were carried up close to the joint, as is obvious on inspection. I have drawn the readerâ€™s attention to this joint, as he must see, that from the power of these muscles, the constant state of exertion, and from the direction in which these powers are exerted, they must exercise a peiq^etual force, calculated to throw the femur upwards and outwards, and, in short, to luxate it; the round liga- ment will hardly serve to prevent this. But there is

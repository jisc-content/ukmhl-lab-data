SURGICAL PRACTICE. 239 ossification of arteries must weaken a part, there can be little doubt; but still the circulation of the blood will go on undisturbed in its passage in this state of the vessels; and this will take place, although the artery be completely ossified, so as to give no sensation of pulsation. I once had a patient with a celebrated anatomist, who conceived that the radial artery did not exist, because he could not feel it pul- sating: it was ossified. The slightest hurt on a limb, the arteries of which are ossified, may produce as destructive effects as the greatest violence in a sound state of parts : thus a slight hurt in a part, the vessels of which are in this state, will produce inflammation of parts which are supplied by ossified arteries ; and this kind of excitement of the diseased vessels is really the cause of gangrene. We have here the excitement to action where there is no power to sustain the process; parts unfit for active life are destroyed by an overpowering stimulus. When arteries are diseased by the deposit of bone, the part is unable to bear any undue action, and the most simple cause is sutficient excitement to produce gangrene: thus the cutting of a corn has been the source of gangrene and death. The first deposit of bone in the coats of an artery is not always readily disclosed to the sense of touch. It is only by passing the finger up and down tiie artery that the sensation is given of the rings of ossification. Before a part has really become gangrenous, there are often premonitory indications that such a

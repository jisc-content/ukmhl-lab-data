247 SURGICAL PRACTICE. R 4 is only water, the effect stops at raising the cuticle into vesications; but if the subject is weakly, even boiling water will produce a slough, or death of the whole or of a layer of the cutis vera. I have seen extensive sloughs formed in delicate children under these circumstances. But scalds produced by boil- ing fat, coffee, beer, &c., have produced, even in strong healthy men, considerable sloughs. I have lately had a case of a vigorous youth who was scalded by boiling beer, where the whole cutis of the leg was reduced to a slough. In the results of bad scalds, there are two circumstances that seem to prove, that the worst scalds are not produced by so intense a heat as even the mildest burns. They often do not destroy the life of the whole stratum of the cutis, so that when the process of cicatriza- tion commences, the sores will be seen to heal from small points in the centre, and not wholly from the circumference ; and, further, there is not that state of the tissues under the sore which pro- duces those strong bands that distort the neigh- bouring parts, when the whole has been healed. The usual course of scalds is, therefore, to heal ra- pidly, when they are brought into a quiet condition favourable for the process of cicatrization. I have often had cases brought from neighbouring iron foundries where burns have been caused by melted metal falling out of the pans in which it is conveyed to the moulds, upon the upper part of the feet of the Avorkmen. Here the matter is heated to such intensity, that the most fearful consequences might be anticipated from its etFccts. It does in-

Strictures of the cesophagus have been described as like those of the urethra. Those that I have seen have been of two sorts ; the one, scirrhus of some part of the tube, for which the affectation of treat- ment may do more harm than good ; the other, oc- curring in females, has been so generally co-existing with hysterical symptoms, that I refer them to that course of treatment.

SUEGICAL PRACTICE. 171 out of the anus, consisting of membrane and piles, giving that condition which surgeons have decided should be submitted to operations to give relief. It may now be observed, that these large masses of internal piles do not give great pain when down, and often none at all; so that the degree of pain is widely different from that case where only a small fold is slipped into the grasp of the sphinc- ter. I apprehend this is explained by the relation- ship that exists in the functions of the parts. The stimulus for relaxing the sphincter is the distension of the boAvel; and when any mass is present low in the rectum, there is a readiness in the sphincter to relax, and therefore there is non^ of that strong and irritable action of this muscle as there is when a small part is within its grasp. In this latter state of things there is no mass low in the rectum to excite either the muscular structure of the bowel to propel its contents, or of the sphincter to relax, which now acts most powerfully on the small fold of membrane, in keeping up a condition of con- stant pain and irritation until it is relieved of the presence of the fold. This is exactly what we recognise in muscles generally. A muscle has only to be placed in an unnatural condition in respect of its sympathies and relations, Avhen it revolts at the derangements it is under, and uses the most powerful exertions, showing the greatest impatience to be relieved from its unnatural state. It is in this Avay that as the internal piles increase, and the permanent mass in the rectum becomes larger, the power, or rather

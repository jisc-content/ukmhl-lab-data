31 SURGICAL PRACTICE. sitioii. The pain soon goes off, and the patient then finds himself well: recumbency in bed is ab- solutely necessary. The fracture of the acromium is a more rare accident than that of the other parts of the scapula, but equally painful; no bandage is required; repose in bed with the arm to the side, by which all the muscles will be in the greatest state of quietude, is all that is required. Every noAV and then I have had cases of fractures of the anatomical neck of the humerus. They have always been in young subjects, and I believe they are cases of separation of the epiphysis. When the arm is quietly reposing at the side of the patient, the only 'muscles hkely to be in moderate action are the four muscles inserted into the tuberosities of the humerus, and they probably cause the alter- ation which takes place on union of the fracture, which is, that these processes are brought higher, and a little more forward than usual. This causes very slight shortening of the arm; but the limb is restored to as useful a state as the other arm. I have lately had a case under my care, where the appearances, after twenty-one Aveeks from the acci- dent, Avere apparently fracture of the clavicle near the acromion, the head of the humerus being pushed back, and placed in a position Avith the upper end pressed on that part of the spine Avhere it terminates in the acromion, and the posterior part on the external side of the inferior costa. This case seemed to simulate, at first vieAv, a luxa- tion of the head of the bone on the dorsum of the scapula.

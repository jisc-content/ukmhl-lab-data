214 SURGICAL PRACTICE. cause of great pain, which, however, quickly subsides on the use of local bleeding and rest; and this re- lief occurs so soon that I have often seen the swel- ling considerably subdued on the day follomng the accident. This is consonant with the course that I have before alluded to, when speaking of the state of the limb where a large vein has been rup- tured. The synovial membrane seems to be capable of quickly absorbing blood, a fact we also observe in the fracture of the patella. I have never dis- covered that any ulterior derangement of the joint has followed these accidents. In the large masses of elFused blood that are often the consequence of severe hurts, the serous portion will sometimes soon become absorbed, but the coagulum will often remain a long time; this will occasionally excite considerable irritation with the formation of abscess. These cases terminate favourably. The removal of these effusions takes place in the best and readiest way when the struc- tures in which they occur are most organised ; a result which might be inferred. It has been noticed by observers, that an occur- rence happens to young children in falls upon the head that may puzzle surgeons. After the fall a considerable effusion is produced under the scalp, hardly rising above the surface, but the boundaries of this appearance are hard, giving the feel of a ridge formed in the aponeurosis, and just that softness which a moderate effusion might offer; it may readily present itself to the observer as a fracture with depression. There are probably no

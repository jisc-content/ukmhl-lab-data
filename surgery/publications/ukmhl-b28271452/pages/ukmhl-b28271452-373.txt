319 SURGICAL PRACTICE. pelvis be but little, and so an increased impulse may be directed to the femoral ring, accounting for this seat of hernia in females. Fig. 6. The fact of the approximation of the two rings in hernia which are slowly formed, has led me to con- ceive that the change might take place under the in- fluence of that conservative power which is always acting for the preservation of the economy of parts, and to prevent the impairment of functions. Thus, if the force which the diaphragm is continually exert- ing be pressing upon that part of the spermatic cord which is lodged in the inguinal canal, by which the structure might be impaired, a process to coun- teract this injurious change will be begun, and a series of alterations will take place to set this struc- ture free from all pressure, or injurious influence, by which means the cord may be allowed to pass at once from the abdomen to the external parts. At all events it is quite common to find that in most people who have passed the middle period of life, the finger can be passed at once through the ex- ternal ring into the abdomen, if a hernia is begin- ning to protrude. It is by no means uncommon to see an immense bulging above Poupart’s ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique appears to be extenuated in these cases, and to yield prodigiously so as to put on the appearance of a ventral rupture, the part being powerfully forced out on the patient’s coughing. This is clearly the efiect of the action of the diaphragm, by which the accumulated forces are directed to this spot, 1 had a patient in the hospital

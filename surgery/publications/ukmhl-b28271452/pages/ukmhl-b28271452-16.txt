X CLAIMS OF SURGERY TO BE The existence of bodies, being a thing of no reasonable doubt, nor to be seriously questioned by any sober understanding, yet as to their nature they admit of no strict and rigorous demonstration upon the principle of sensation. No truth can be demonstrated but what has a dependence upon its principles, otherwise that by which the proof is to be made will want proof itself, and therefore is no demonstration. But where is the necessary con- nection between a sensation within, and the exist- ence of bodies without?* “ Sensus enim fallunt utique. Testimonium et informatio sensus semper sunt ex analogia hominis non ex analogia universi; atque prorsus magno errore asseritur, sensum esse mensuram rerum ; sensus enim per se res infima est et aberrans.” f Science being a series of demonstrations de- rivable from absolute truths, the senses cannot afford that sort of intelligence of things upon which the principles of science may be founded. “ The senses may be adequate and sufficient for the end which nature designed, to give advertise- ment of corporeal things without us, yet sense is not intellection. Sense is fixed in the material form, and not able to ascend to an abstract uni- versal notion.” J Sense is not science or intellection, * An Essay on the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World, by J.

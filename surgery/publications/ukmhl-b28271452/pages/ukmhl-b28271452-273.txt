219 SURGICAL PRACTICE. SO that these cases have ended by being plugged. But what I contend for is, that if the syringing be carried on until the bleeding ceases, it will not only stop, but not recur. It is generally con- sidered of importance, that the water used in cases of bleeding should be cold; but from what I have observed, arteries will contract under the use of warm water, which has a better effect in clearing away the clots, and keeping the parts clean from the blood. I have already alluded to the influence of a coagulum in keeping up bleeding, when speak- ing of the necessity of squeezing out the coagulum in a pile Avhen it is opened. It is a frequent embarrassment to the practitioner to find, that after he has applied leeches they will go on bleeding beyond all expectation, and soon place children in danger of life. I have often been called in upon such emergencies, and never found the following expedient to fail, simple as it is. I wind a very small piece of lint into a hard knot, so as to be less than a pea, and Aviping the orifice quite clean of blood, and placing this little pad upon the bleeding point, then taking advantage of the elasticity of the integument, I draw a strip of adhe- sive plaster tight over it. This has been quite enough to stop it perfectly, and on the third day there is an end of the wound. The point to be observed particularly in this application is, that the strip of plaster may be long enough to ensure a steady pressure of the pad by drawing up the integuments from a distance, by which the elastic quality of this structure gives a permanent pres-

282 SURGICAL PRACTICE. which may be taken as analogous. We find that those organs that pursue an unbroken course of appointed actions are but seldom the seat of disease, as is the case with the lachrymal and salivary glands, which are always pouring out their neces- sary fluids. The energies of healthy actions when fully sustained, are opposed to the encroachments of disease. One considerable part of the practice of surgery is that of employing, and properly adapting the several alterative applications we may have the command of. If we have to treat a sore that is irritable, painful on pressure, and discharging not pus, but viscid matter, forming a mask over the surface of the living structure, we know that healthy gra- nulations are not underneath; that there is a perverted instead of a natural action going on in the part, and which art ought to be able to change. We apply that useful alterative, the nitrico-oxyde of mercury, and almost in a feiv hours this will have changed the sore so far that it now secretes healthy pus, and can easily bear a gentle pressure without bringing on any irritation; we have indeed in this effect the best evidence of the value of an alterative application. We have overcome the deranged action by instituting a healthy one, and the change thus produced is permanent. But it is not only on the part itself that the in- fluence of an alterative remedy may be exerted, for we know that, by means of those sympathies or associations that exist between distant parts, we can act favourably on a diseased part, by means

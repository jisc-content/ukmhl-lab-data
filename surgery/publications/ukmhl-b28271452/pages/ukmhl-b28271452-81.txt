27 SUEGICAL PEACTICE. which to act; but the moment they lose this cen- tre, the association of actions is broken up, and new associations are begun to be formed, under new conditions. Thus in luxations of six weeksâ€™ standing we find nothing of that assistance which the muscles combine (in recent cases) to place in the service of the operator : in vain he makes his extension day after day, and fails if he conducts the traction from a fixed point. He must now make his extension from a moveable point, that may be capable of changing its place in a circuit of considerable amplitude. A case presented itself to me in which the hu- merus had been luxated seven weeks, extension was conducted in the usual way for a long time, and with the fullest force, and no reduction resulted. I then drew the limb across the chest obliquely, and by this means returned the head of the bone into the glenoid cavity with very little effort. A maid-servant fell down stairs and injured her shoulder; a practitioner living near was sent for, who was not aware it was a luxation. The mistress sent her to me at the end of six weeks; I saw the nature of the case, and took her to the hospital. I first tried the usual plan in vain; I then placed a thick body just in front of the axilla; and by first drawing the arm down, and then carrying it across the chest over the body, the bone slipped easily into its place. The perfect use of the limb was ultimately recovered. Thus it is not by the force of extension, but by the adaptation of appropriate manipulation, that old cases are to be reduced.

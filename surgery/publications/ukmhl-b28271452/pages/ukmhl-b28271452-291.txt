SURGICAL PRACTICE. 237 OAvn pains. I have seen the most benefit done to warts by applying opium in powder to them, by which their irritability is removed, and then per- haps they will disappear. A slight influence, that ordinarily passes off by a single impression, will of course, by its continual presence, effect a complete alteration in the vital powers of parts. The fleeting impression of se- vere cold may, as a stimulus, animate the func- tions of life to improved state of health; but the same impressioDS going on continuously for some time, may reduce the strength of the powers of resistance or of accommodation, both which are indications of the vigour of the actions of life. This reduced state of vital power renders parts unable to sustain the stimulus of those excitements which, in the full vigour of the body, should carry on the functions of life to healthful reactions. Thus we see, as in a weakly sore, the stimulus which, Avhen applied to a healthy one, Avould add impetus to the processes of reparation, will cause this sore to ulcerate and increase; so the frost-bitten part is likely to pass into gangrene if the stimulus of heat be abruptly applied. There are many who, in the usual cold of our Avinters, suffer from chilblains. This com- plaint appears to me to be the result of an abiding in- fluence of cold depressing the vital energies of parts so much as to lessen their poAver to sustain moderate excitements, Avhich usually only raise the processes of reparation. Thus it happens that chilblains arc commonly produced by some slight hurt on parts Avhich have lost the poAver of preserving their

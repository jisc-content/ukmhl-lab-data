119 SURGICAL PRACTICE. tures, explained my views on the best method to be adopted for reducing bones, when broken, to the proper state of co-aptation. In regard to the mea- sures to be employed for the purpose of adjusting the bones in apposite and proper position, I firmly believe that it is more to the ultimate advantage of the patient that the bones should be left in an irre- gular form, than that the limb should be stretched and pulled about for any length of time, to give it an appearance adequate to the surgeonâ€™s views of accuracy or neatness. Many lives, and still more many limbs, have been lost, by carrying on perse- vering eflbrts in opposition to the action of muscles, which, without effecting any good purpose, have added to the derangement, and suspended the operation of the powers of accommodation from adapting structures to circumstances. It is to be borne in mind that the wound pro- duced with the fracture is not a simple wound through the integument. It is really, for the most part, a very large wound, much deeper than the integuments; all the parts around the bone are torn and detached, and therefore even if the in- tegument heals, there is, out of sight, much to be done. As an abstract question, it is of little con- sequence if the external wound be large; as by being so we get a freer way for the discharge of the pus, know what is going on, and have more in- sight of what is required for the treatment. But yet, if the wound in the integument be very small, then the bones have not been much detached from their adjoining soft parts, and the external wound

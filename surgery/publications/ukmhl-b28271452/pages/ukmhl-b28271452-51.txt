xlv CLASSED AS A SCIENCE. Psalms. t Pascal. pansion. It is the very quality of science that every step that is made in it must be inceptive of other advances. By the globus intellectualis of Bacon, we may conceive that he imputes to it the power of expanding in every direction. Science begins every- where, and it ends nowhere. We know that the ho- rizon of the mathematician has no boundaries. The omnipotent Author of the creation has declared that all the works of his hands are verity and judgment*; and this is a postulatum which must be accepted, before any scientific principles can be formed. When nature opens her lap of rich stores to the scrutiny of the philosopher, he finds that there is not a spot to which he can point his stile, in which a truth does not lie concealed, to bring which to light is a germ of science, which will not fail to go on to its full growth under the cultivation of an intel- lectual mind. AU the parts of nature are made one whole by association. “ Toutes choses etant causes et causantes, aidees et aidantes, mediatement et im- mediatement, et toutes s’entretenant par un lien naturel et invisible, qui lie les plus dloigndes et les plus difibrentes.” f If all these relations were fully displayed, we should probably be surprised at the most unaccountable connection in which very dif- ferent parts are held in correlation. Man is placed in the midst of infinity. lie is placed in infinite space — he exists in infinite time.

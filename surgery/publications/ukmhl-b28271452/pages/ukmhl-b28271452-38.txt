CLAIMS OF SURGERY TO BE XXXll occur, because as truth is the very essence of science, what was taught as a science would carry with it all the powers of its influence, and maintain the certainty of its results. It may be again repeated that surgery is both taught and practised by prescription. And although it may, without doubt, be made to assume all the characters and the improved value of a scientific profession, it hardly yet presents itself with claims to be called a science, in the just and legitimate accept- ation of this word. It is a fact admitted by all observers, that great and persisting processes of nature are carried on by an under current. It is not by looking on the swell- ing and impetuous wave, beating against breakers, but in observing what is going on in the gentle ripplings of the ebb tide, that the philosopher is best enabled to institute his inquiries, and to draw his safest conclusions. It is so in medical practice: whilst the practitioner, relying upon the etficiency of his remedies, is confidently expecting to prove their curative powers, he is obliged to acknow- ledge that disease unalterably advances to a de- structive end. And, on the other hand, the attendant may sometimes find, that when he de- spairs of his means, the processes of nature, quietly working under a concealed influence, slowly perfect the unlooked-for cure. The medical man tasks his memory to the suggestion of some expedient to meet the various changes that occur in disease.

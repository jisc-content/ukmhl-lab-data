SUKGICAL PRACTICE. M 4 1G7 It is not unusual to have other sinuses about the anus that have no connection with the rectum. I have occasionally had patients who, either from falling from a height, or having been rough riders, contusing the parts about the ischium, have had disease and altered states produced either in the tuberosity of this bone, or in the fibrous structures ' about it, and also in the ramus of the same bone. These are intractable cases, as the powers for set- ting up the reparative process are very difficult to rouse. I have had a long attendance on a gen- tleman who suffered from most extensive and very various sinuses and abscesses within the pelvis, about the ischium, where the most probable cause was hard cavalry exercise and wet clothes. I have often had sinuses about the anus, where they seemed to arise from a diseased state either of the os coccygis itself, or of the structures connected with it. These also are secondary affections; and as they depend upon the state of these parts, so they are very intractable: they occur in structures of languid action, and are long in getting into a healthy state. If they depend upon necrosis, the release of the bone determines the case. External piles are very generally of a periodical occurrence. I have noticed that they occur where the secretions are sparing, and therefore, perhaps, in the cold seasons rather than in the warm ones. They have apparently their periods; that is, they have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This is the case with many complaints, particularly in those for which the greatest number of remedies are pro-

SUKGICAL PRACTICE. 287 Thus there is kept up as it were an oscillation of varying energies, all useful for the design with which the remedy is employed; and this beneficial efiect, the employment of such things as glass beads cannot produce. As the efficacy of the remedy arises so much . from the active state of it, if I find an issue indo- lent, I at once make another, and this perhaps is often repeated : I find that they frequently lose their lively state in a month or six weeks, and this may require that the issue should be re- newed. I never find that patients who have once had an issue, and experienced the benefit of it, object to submit to have others made. To know the full value of issues in cases requiring them, this care to keep up effective ones must be invariably followed. The issue is indeed a most effective remedy in diseases of all kinds in the joints, in dis- eases of the vertebro3 and of the long bones, and even in diseases of the periosteum, or fascia; in short, in all diseases of deep parts it is available.

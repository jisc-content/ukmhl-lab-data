It is a very considerable time before the discharge of the abscess begins to lessen, and it often con- tinues so long that the patient sinks into that state which is called hectic fever, a condition quite diflerent from that of irritative fever. Those abscesses which are attributed to phlebitis and the absorption of pus, are well marked as to character, but we occasionally meet with others similar to what were formerly common in severe cases of small-pox.

SUEGICAL PRACTICE. 2G3 glands: they are structures that are intimately connected with the surface, and therefore the bites often add to the irritation of the gland. There are various conditions of the disease of the bursa over the patella, usually called the house- maidâ€™s knee. I have rarely seen them get well except when rest has been strictly followed. In the most common case, if it be recent, and the cyst not thickened, a few applications of leeches will eifect a cure: but rest is still indispensable. AVhen they are of longer duration the leeching is not enough, but something in the way of counter- irritation mil be necessary, by which they mil get well. I include all stimulating applications in this term. The thickening of the cyst does not bear any precise relation to the duration of the complaint. When the cyst is hard and large, I think I have observed most good derived from blistering. If the bursm are very tender and pain- ful, the synovial membrane' then often becomes simultaneously atfected. Occasionally they are presented to us in a state of suppuration, when they really give little disturbance to the consti- tution, and usually get quite well if the cyst has opened of itself, but if the surgeon opens these cysts when they are highly inflamed, and before pus is formed, they then produce a fearful disturbance of the system, and bring the patient to a condition of imminent danger ; the parts around are also en- gaged in the active inflammation. This is another case to prove the beneficial influence which the secretion of pus has upon inflammatory action.

But besides this indolent chancre there are conditions of chancre of the most active kind, so that its progress speedily runs into extensive ulceration, and even into death of some of the structures. It is not at all uncommon to see cases where a chancre has been established on the inside of the prepuce, and by the patient committing a series of excesses, or by sulFering considerable irritation, by friction or othenvise of the part, a slough has been produced, which has destroyed a considerable portion of the foreskin; and in such cases in the course of a little time, after this slough has been thrown otf, the sore has assumed clearly the character of a chancre ; and I have often seen this state of the local affection followed by secondary symptoms.

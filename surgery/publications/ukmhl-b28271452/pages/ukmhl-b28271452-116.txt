62 SUIiGICAL PRACTICE. external malleolus, should be accurately placed in the same plane, and the hips should be kept the one vertically over the other, {jig. 2.) When the femur is broken just above the con- dyle, the straight position is adopted, which I consider to be the proper one. In the straight position the extensor muscles will combine their action to keep the bone in a line. But if the leg be bent, these muscles cease to act so favourably; and the hamstring muscles being now in that state in which their actions are usually called forth, combine to derange the broken parts. The power of their action is also then increased by the ad- vantage of an increased lever for their action. Some surgeons adopt a plan of treating frac- tures of the femur by means of a long splint, and binding up the limb tightly over it. Occasionally a favourable case has turned out in this way. The success of this treatment rests upon the making the trunk and the limb one whole, so that the limb is protected from all disturbances from collateral actions. The patient is to keep on his back per- fectly recumbent. The objection to this plan is the great use of bandages, and consequently hin- drance of examining the limb from time to time, owing to which circumstance I have seen very bad unions follow. Occasionally there are fractures which are carried from the trochlea of the patella, between the con- dyles, to one side or to the other of the shaft of the femurâ€”an analogous case to what has been referred to in the humerus.

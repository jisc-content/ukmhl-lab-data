223 SURGICAL PRACTICE, other contrivance, to strengthen and restore veins. Females rather lusty, who have borne children, and in whom the saphena vein in the thigh is apt to become prodigiously enlarged, are very subject to these ruptures of veins. The very great proportion of ulcers of the legs that I have to treat in the hospital are the result of disease of the veins. The varicose ulcer is by far the most common, so that bating the specific sores, injuries of the leg, and some from amenorr- haea in the female, nearly all sore legs present this character. This ulcer is singular in appear- ance, and has well-marked features. The incon- venience and pain caused to the patient are much beyond the apparent amount of excitement. Its situation is almost always just above the inner ankle, if the large saphena is the vein diseased, and the same place on the opposite side, in case it is the smaller saphena. It presents a breadth of irritation of some size, but having no defined regular boundary, of the diffused orange colour, unequally extended round. It gives great pain, and rather of a dis- tressing kind than intense; this is often the case, even without an actual sore: but generally the surgeon is not called upon to advise upon the case, till at least a sore is produced. This sore occupies but a small part of the disease of the skin, and above all, if it be seen early it has not assumed the character of an ulcer, it is shallow, and may be described as an abrasion. The unvarying pain, with the absence of active inflammation, and the slight sore, are the characters of this complaint.

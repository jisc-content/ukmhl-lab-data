SUKGICAL PRACTICE. 152 fascia; but the little apparent external disease, and the depth to be cut through, are obstacles to get- ting the consent of the patient for such a step. The division of this thickened fascia seems at once to be the excitement for that process which is really the effort for reparation. There are other cases of some disease about the fascia which equally causes induration of the tissues over it; which, probably, is an early stage of the preceding. I have adopted, in many of these cases, a division of the diseased part, and often, I believe, with suc- cess. A slight thickening often gives rise to a small collection of pus, which, of course, calls for an opening. Many cases occur of a form of disease which seems an equally altered state of the subcutaneous tissues, and of the cutis with it. It is a painful affection, very slow in its advances, and very ir- regular in the changes that take place, and it does not always observe any continuous course. I have generally tried incisions, but not with such success as I anticipated; yet that step is useful. The sur- face always in some parts ulcerates, and in doing this, the ulcer extends .very often through the cutis to the structure beneath. This tissue is often thrown off in the form of a slough, or of a core, as the patient describes it. These cases almost always occur about the knee, sometimes about the elbows. The subjects are usually females. I have not collected any proofs that this disease has a constitutional cause, although it often occurs on both sides of the body. I have found that the

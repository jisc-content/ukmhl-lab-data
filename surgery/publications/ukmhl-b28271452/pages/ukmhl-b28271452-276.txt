222 SURGICAL PRACTICE. The immediate stoppage of the bleeding, by placing the patient in a horizontal position, should always be borne in mind. We recognise here the power of gravitation on the fluid in the vein in the erect position, yet there must be an influence in oppo- sition to the principles of hydraulics, to carry the blood onwards, for if there were not, the bleeding would not so quickly nor so completely stop on the patient lying down. There is also reason to infer from this fact, that the circulation is carried on much more tranquilly in the horizontal position of the limb than when the body is erect; which we acknowledge as a principle in selecting our mode of treating affections of the lower extremity. So much influence as gravitation can exert must be met by a proportionate increase in the powers of the circulation, in order to keep up the due current of circulation in the veins. These cases do not always occur in those who have that thickening of the valves of the veins which commonly accompanies varicose sores, but in those whose cutis is of a delicate texture, and whose veins are enlarged but not thickened. Veins in this condition often give way without the pre- vious existence of an ulcer, but the rupture is com- monly the cause of its formation. Of course the treatment is rest, and pursuing the proper mode of healing the sore. The sore should be well healed before the patient moves upon the leg. I am so fully impressed with the efficacy of fric- for procuring the healthy state of veins, that all persons who have varix should not omit the flesh- brush, which will do more than bandages, oi any

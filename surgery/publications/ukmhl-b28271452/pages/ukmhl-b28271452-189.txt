135 SURGICAL PRACTICE. injuries that are brought to the hospital. These cases, besides presenting an extensive laceration of the integuments, are often attended by fracture of the bones of the fore arm, crushing of the carpal and metacarpal bones, and wounds into the wrist joint: the fingers are particularly subject to the same sort of injuries. These are cases requiring great consideration, on the subject of sa^dng the limb, or not, or of saving some part of it. One of the great points in the injuries of this limb, that should guide our prognosis, is the situa- tion of the chief injury. Thus, if the back of the fore-arm be torn up, and even if the bones be shat- tered, the limb may often be saved, and the patient ultimately enjoy the comfort of a useful member. The vessels and nerves lie on the front of the arm, and if these be but little injured, the whole power of vital energy is preserved to the limb. Moreover, the muscles at the back are of less power, and there- fore of less importance, if the limb be deprived of their use ultimately. But even if the chief injury be in the front of the fore-arm, provided the whole series of muscles and the bones be not entirely smashed, and the surgeon finds that the thumb and one finger can be saved, and the muscles, that is, of the thumb only, exist in a state to be capable of acting when the wound is healed, then so much of the hand should be saved. I have often secured to a patient a very useful hand in such severe injuries. A vast number of cases present themselves at the hospital of accidents and diseases of the fingers ; and these are particularly interesting, inasmuch as

SUIIGICAL rEACTICE. 40 As explained on other occasions, the giving a rotatory motion to the hone will be the best way of overcoming this kind of opposition. The first phalanx has not a strictly gingly- moid connection with the metacarpal bones. All the other joints of the phalanges are strictly so formed. Some years ago, a patient was brought to the hospital with a luxation of the first phalanx of the second toe upon the metatarsal bone ; a very long and powerful extension had been made, and without any imiiression upon the displaced bone. I bent this phalanx at right angles to the other bone, and with one finger pressed the projecting end downwards, and then made the other end revolve, so as to make a straight line with the fixed bone. Thus, without any pain, and with the utmost facility, the reduc- tion was effected. I was standing in the quadran- gle of the hospital, when I saw a student fall upon one hand. I immediately examined it, and found the last phalanx of the thumb was dislocated, the bone lying on the dorsum of the other phalanx. I brought the luxated bone doâ€™vvn at right angles over the other, and pushing it towards the palm at the same time that I extended it lengthwise, re- duced it with perfect ease, and without pain. But a phalanx may be dislocated backwards by a force in another direction, that is, where it is applied, at right angles, to the bone that is luxated, and in this way displace it backwards, still allowing it to be parallel with the upper bone. This kind of luxation requires a different method for reducing

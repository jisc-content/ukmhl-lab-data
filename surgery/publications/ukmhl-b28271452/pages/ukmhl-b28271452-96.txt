42 SURGICAL PRACTICE. adopted, is that of keeping the muscles in their natural order, and power of acting. Fractures of the clavicle occasionally occur so near the acromial joint, that it is difficult to determine whether they are not luxations; as the corocoid ligaments keep the parts from separating. I treat all the fractures of the clavicle by merely placing the patients on flat beds; by which the parts assume and preserve their natural position. Bandages seem to do little good commonly, and are not required if the patient keep his bed. This is a bone that quickly unites, and therefore the patients are soon relieved from this awkward position. A cabman was brought to the hospital, who had been jerked from his seat in turning a corner, and had both his clavicles broken in about the middle part of them. I merely placed him on a flat bed, and in three weeks both bones were perfectly united, and without deformity, although there had been con- siderable displacement at first. Infants are frequently brought to us, in whom, by some accident, the clavicle has been only bent, and not completely separated by fracture. This bone suffers in very young children readily, when they fall from small heights, as from the motherâ€™s lap ; and the injury is very often not adverted to, being only discovered after a few days, as the mother is dressing the child. The best bandage is a hand- kerchief bound round in a figure of eight form, and a sling : the deformity, if any, soon disappears. The construction of the joint of the lower jaw is peculiar, as the motion of the bone is not about a

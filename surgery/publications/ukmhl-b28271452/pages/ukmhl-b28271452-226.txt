172 SURGICAL PRACTICE. the energy, of the sphincter to retain its contents lessens, and that on any impulse directed to the part, particularly the effort of relieving the bowel, pro- lapse takes place, as the increasing loose state of the bowel, and defective power of the sphincter, neces- sarily promote both the facility for protruding, and for enlarging the mass. The influence of habit will leave the bowel, when unaided by its muscular structure to propel the con- tents, to enlarge and form a pouch of considerable dimensions. By very gradual steps the muscular fibres will bear the residence of immense masses of indurated stuff without being excited to the effort of dejecting it; and thus the medical man is some- times called upon to dig out, as it were, a bulk of hardened clay. We must remember that structures whose func- tions are impaired have, when not impeded by agents from without, a tendency to revert to that healthy state in which their functions can best be exercised. In this case the first object would be to prevent the accumulation of fmcal matter in the sigmoid flexure and upper part of the rectum. The descent of a fold of the membrane must place the veins that run in it most favourably for becoming haemorrhoids; and the daily course of this condition of the membrane must encourage the increase. These piles, when the bowel is projected outwards, are full, hard, and bleed; but when the part is returned, they are felt only as small soft protuberances in the walls of the tube, which, of course, derive their distended state from

That period of life at which the men- struating process ceases, certainly gives greater activity to the ravages of the complaint. If I confine my observations to those cases which I have had the opportunity of watching during the continuance of the patientâ€™s existence, I should come to the conclusion that the removal of unequivocal cancerous disease does not prolong life. Many cases are known to have been operated upon a second time, in consequence of a recurrence of the disease in the same part. This at once proves the fallacy of the proposition for operating at all in such cases. There are also contingencies of fre- quent occurrence that should have their due weight in the question of operating for this disease.

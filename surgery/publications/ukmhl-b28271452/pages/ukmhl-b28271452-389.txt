335 SURGICAL RRACTICE. soiiouB matter is secreted on the surface of a spot of a part of which the structure is completely altered in its condition, so as to give to the touch a feeling of induration not unlike cartilage. This kind of change in structure seems to form the essential character of chancre. We know that it is an organ formed of such a character to complete those series of symp- toms that are understood to display the full course of the venereal disease, for although a chancre may heal, yet, if the hardness continues, constitutional symptoms will follow. It seems to me quite gratuitous to suppose that there are varieties of chancres, there being no ana- logy of such a latitude of states in small-pox or the vaccine vesicle; yet there are varieties in the conditions of chancres depending upon adventitious circumstances, in some measure necessarily arising out of the differences of the structures on Avhich they are formed. Thus it is that a chancre on the inside of the prepuce, or on the glans penis, will have greater thickening than when it occurs on the outside, on the surface of the integument of the penis, in which situation, owing to the thin- ness of the cutis and delicacy of the subjacent tissue, there occurs little depth of induration. On the inner side, where there is a greater scope for thickening, the sore but slowly enlarges its dimen- sions ; but if the sore is on the outer integument, it then enlarges comparatively quickly, and some- times we have very large chancres in this situation, wliere they generally look very florid. On the labium pudendorum the chancre assumes a tuber- cular form, as it docs also on the scrotum; in both

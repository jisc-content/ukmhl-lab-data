After this, I allow him to get up, and rest upon the side of the bed for a portion of the day; he has now all his muscles free from adhesions or contractions; and by following the steps I shall have to allude to, -will, without crutches, soon be able to walk across the room. About two years ago, I attended a lady with a broken patella on one side, who had had the same accident on the other knee some years before. She spoke in high terms of the great advantages of this plan, by which she was so soon enabled to get about.

16 SURGICAL PRACTICE. their water without a drop passing through, which is contrary to the laws of hydraulics. We have constantly, after the operation of lithotomy, the opportunity of seeing the water ceasing to pass through the wound long before this has healed. But the most satisfactory evidence will be found in the way which a patient gets rid of a body that has jiassed into the trachea; it is not by hanging with his head downwards, but by sitting up, as all people, I believe, do, when they have to expectorate mucus. If the body is movable, it may certainly be placed in that condition for a speedy relief of it, without the occasion of opening into the patientâ€™s trachea. By health we understand the orderly and com- plete manner in which the animal functions are carried on. But health is not an aggregation of the same terms of existence in all, so that even health has its individuality in each being. Yet, in all the varieties of robust or weak structure, when parts are injured or deranged, we see the power of conservancy engaged in setting ujd the actions for repair. It seems to be received in physiology as a fact, that there is a continual mutation going on in the animal body. That there is a removal of one set of particles, and a deposition of another set of par- ticles, and yet that the true model of the original remains perfectly unchanged; and this mutation is effected by no obvious alteration; but is steady in its course, undeviating in fulfilling its purpose, and defined clearly in its limits. All this implies a conservative principle that preserves the whole.

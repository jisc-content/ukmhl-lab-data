From this observation I am led to suppose that in all successful cases of this kind, that will happen which, we know takes place in wounds into the cavity of the peritoneum, which is, that adhesions are formed between the edges of the wound in the synovial membrane, and the part upon which it lies, and thus, as in the case of the peritoneum, the inflam- mation is circumscribed to the mere wound and therefore checked from spreading. The ankle is a joint not so often the subject of disease as the knee. The early state of this complaint is also evidenced by the impaired motion of the bones, which is best seen when the foot is attempted to be bent to the utmost, as it cannot be made to rise to the same acute angle with the leg as it ought to do. It is stiff and uncomfortable on movinsr O about, and is also very uneasy at night; there is more swelling about it than in the disease of the knee. I think it is disposed to make greater advance in the progress of disease than the other joints, as sinuses leading to the bones are sooner formed. This joint is not so generally relieved from disease as the others; but still the real success must depend on rest and issues. The joints between the tarsal and carpal bones are frequently affected in the same way as the other joints, and are equally capable of being restored by the same kind of treatment. The diseases of the joints of the fingers arc recoverable beyond all expectation; the loss of cartilage can be supplied,

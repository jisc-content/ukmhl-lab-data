SURGICAL PRACTICK. J75 month. Other cases of a slighter kind have been set to rights in not much more than a week. The patient should be kept in bed of course, so that there should be every facility for repose of the bowel; and after it is cleansed out, a small quantity of the injection should be daily thrown up, and retained. If the stomach can take balsams, they seem well adapted for the treatment of this disease.

When this part is dis- eased, these veins may be felt plainly as enlarged bodies, and they are usually harder than the mere pile: they of course are fixed, and they occasionally bleed â€” an event generally salutary to the disease of the gland. Many cases occur of what are called stricture of the rectum. They may be divided into those that are annular, and into those that are tubercular. The tubercular have often condylomata around the anus: they occur chiefly in the female sex. These condylomata seem not oidy to spring up out- wardly, but a little way up the rectum.

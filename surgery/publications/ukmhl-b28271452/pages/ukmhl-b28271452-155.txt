If this organ does not favourably respond to the aids which a generous diet can supply, cases of severe injuries are generally fatal. If the patient survives to the period of the suppurative stage, stimuli will help to carry on the processes adapted for restoration ; but they will not sustain the poAvers engaged in this work to the end. There is no direct relation between the progress of the local reparative process, and the improvement of the tone of the constitution ; the former may ap- pear very slowly to advance, while the general powers of the patient are even declining.

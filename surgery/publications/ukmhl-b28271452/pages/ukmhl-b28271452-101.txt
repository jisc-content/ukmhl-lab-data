SURGICAL PRACTICE. 47 which the eiFusion of air into the cellular tissue under the integuments, is stopped. The air passing from the wounded lung is now confined to the cavity of the pleura, with which it is tilled, and com- pressing the lung. By this means the wound which was made while the lung was dilated, is more com- pletely closed than could have been done by any contrivance of art. This wound is usually healed on the third day; at that period the breathing greatly improves, as air can no longer be effused into the pleura, the wound of the lung having healed. I cannot conceive that it can be neces- sary to make punctures in the integuments to let out the air in emphysema. The air, of all things is most readily absorbed, and almost instantly dis- appears the moment effusion ceases. I usually find that on the third day these cases are reduced to the state of a simple fracture of a rib. In these injuries we find that a fracture of one rib is generally a case giving the surgeon little trouble ; but fractures of two, three, or more ribs, offer a difference in a most marked degree. When more than one rib are broken, we have a case of importance ; and if the fracture extends to several, there generally follows a fatal termination as the result. The two last, or floating ribs, are often the sub- ject of injuries that are more painful, and slower in recovering, than a broken rib. Most commonly they are violently driven inwards without being fractured. The diaphragm then suffers; and if they are broken, still the same parts suffer, and the pain is very great. In this case a bandage is of

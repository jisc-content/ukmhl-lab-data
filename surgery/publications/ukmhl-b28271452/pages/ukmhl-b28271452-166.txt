112 SURGICAL PRACTICU. such parts of a limb as may be of the most valuable service to the patient. I have reason for thinking, that very often limbs have been unnecessarily talen olf under the impression that the cases were trau- matic gangrene, when the real case was only slough- ing of integuments, or other parts, arising from the exceeding violence locally inflicted, where there was a state of good and regular health. I shall again add, that a new function for re- paration having been once set up, the whole system readily associates this function to the others, when occasion requires. Many years ago, I had a patient in the hospital with compound fracture of the leg. He suffered much, and was long in a precarious state, but he ultimately went out quite well. In no long time, perhaps in two or three years, he met with an accident, by which he had a compound fracture, in very nearly the same place, of the same leg. I recollected the circumstance of his former precarious state, and was then fearful of the event. But he had hardly any general dis- turbance, and the result was, that the bones united, and the wound healed, with not any more derange- ment, either locally or generally, than a common sore on the leg. He soon left the hospital quite well. Analogous instances often occur, and the surgeon should bear in mind this view of the prin- ciples upon which they rest. There is a series of very severe injuries that do not present, in full features, that remarkable power over the constitution which I have attributed to injuries attended with wounds. They are injuries

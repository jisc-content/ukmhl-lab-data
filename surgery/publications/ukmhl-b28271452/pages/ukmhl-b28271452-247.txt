SUEGICAL rRACTICE. ld‘d and supersedes tlic appropriate function, the influ- ence of which is a dominant power for restoring the mischief. I must repeat what I have so often enjoined, that the practice should consist in soothing the parts and keeping them in as natural a state as possible by avoiding any unnecessary interference. The patient should be kept in bed, and his state of health of course strictly attended to. This form of abscess or fistula is usually met with in robust patients, or those who are not advanced in life. I have occasionally seen a small collection of pus in the tissue under the skin of the perineum, and seeming almost pendulous; this has occurred in those who have had an irritable urethra ; the abscess, nevertheless, having no connection with it. I have, however, seen this formation occur more than once, and get well, when afterwards an abscess communi- cating with this canal took place. I think they arise from some associations of sympathy in the urinary organs. Sometimes this small collection has been absorbed ; and when opened it has soon healed. The other case of the escape of urine, or rather the case of actual effusion of the fluid, is of a much more formidable character. The subjects in whom it occurs are usually of a different class; being gene- I’ally advanced in age, or, at all events, with the general health impaired by previous disease. The causes leading to this complaint are, as in the other, a long-existing stricture, and tlie unceasing pressure upon the tube beyond it.

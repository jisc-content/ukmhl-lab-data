310 SURGICAL PRACTICE. tage it olFers of speedy union, saves a great an- noyance to which such a wound is often subject. If there is a large flap, and no union has taken place either in the edges or otherwise, this part is very apt to coil inwards, and make an awkward contraction of the aponeurosis, and with it of the whole scalp. At a greater age than childhood the detached scalp Avill sometimes adhere to denuded bone without the intervention of suppuration, but of course the probability is that death of the bone and exfoliation will follow. This probability is increased in proportion to the age of the patient. In children exfoliation will rarely happen; and in adults it will often be not deeper than the external table, and commonly only a thin scale. There is a circumstance, arising from the way in which an injury is produced on the head, being simply on account of the direction in which the blow is given, which alters altogether the effects that are produced on the brain. To explain this, it must be remembered that the skull makes, in all its sections, some sort of curve; and also that the con- tents so nearly approach to the quality of fluid, that every impetus impinged on one part will be trans- mitted through it in the direction in which the blow is given. If every blow was given at right angles to the tangent of any part of these curves, the effects would be transmitted to the base of the brain. But as this is not always the way they are directed, there are great differences in the efl*ects of fractures, and also concussions, on the sensorial powers. If the blow is in sucli a direction that it

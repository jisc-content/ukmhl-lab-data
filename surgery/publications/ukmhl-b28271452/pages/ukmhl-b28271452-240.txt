186 SURGICAL PRACTICE. as the square of the diameter of the greater to the square of the diameter of the lesser ; and so much of the momentum impressed upon the fluid which is not expended upon this increased velocity, is lost upon the sides of the wider part of the tube. Thus in strictures there is always a considerable force lost upon the side of the posterior part of the urethra, because so far from the urine passing through the stricture with increased velocity, it is with great straining squeezed out very slowly. It is likely, then, that some changes should take place in the urethra posterior to the stricture. We must advert to the influence that this ob- struction to the free passage of the urine may have upon the bladder; and I believe it will be found that there are two results, probably depending upon the diflerence in the irritability of the bladder, that may ensue. The one is that in which the muscular structure is greatly increased, and the cavity much diminished. The other is where the capacity of the viscus is increased, and the muscu- lar coat but slightly thickened. In the former state we may also probably look to the irritable state of the prostatic part of the urethra as a further cause. In the consideration of this disease there is an element to be taken into the account which, I think, is not ordinarily brought under view. I am convinced, from a long attention to the course of gonorrhea and other circumstances, that the pros- tate gland is a very common source of the derange- ments in the urethra; and that under an altered state of this gland, the associations between tlie

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 238 healtliy state, from having suffered the depressive influence of cold. I have very generally been able to trace the complaint to some contingent cause besides cold. The influence of cold east wind on the surface of the body, and on the mucous mem- brane, is so Avell known as to lead me to attribute some of these diseases to similar causes. I have found that opium has the most beneficial effect, when used as an application to chilblains. As cold depresses the powers of the structures to a degree which diminishes the ability of parts to resist the derangements that slight injuries may inflict, so that state of the arteries which we call ossification will do the same, but in a greater degree, by having a more unabating influence; as the influence of cold is temporary, that of diseased arteries is permanent. I have always been able to trace the state of senile gangrene to a slight injury, previous to its taking place. The state of ossification often exists without gangrene ever being produced; but if this state of arteries does exist, the merest trivial hurt leads to the disease. I have however often seen slight bruises occur in such subjects, and where, by good management, approaching gangrene has been warded off: that is, the vigour of the part, when assisted by art, may be just equal to resist the destructive influence, and to restore parts to healthy action. We accept as a law in pathology, that any given injury of a part must vary in its results in proportion to the condition of the circulation of that part. That the

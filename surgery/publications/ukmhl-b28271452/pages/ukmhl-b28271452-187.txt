The period before suppuration is esta- blished, is most momentous in these cases, and the closest observation is required to meet every change. But this period being over, if we find that all the combined functions have subsided into a steady course of action, then we have the advan- tage of the seat of injury being nearer the centre of circulation, by which the powers of the system are greater for sustaining the demands that are required. But the injury is nearer the centre of gravity of the individual; therefore there is not the same security against the communication of move- ments to the broken bones. We must bear in mind, in forming a prognosis of cases of severe injuries of joints, that the result is by no means proportionate to the extent and degree of the mischief produced. A carpenter, at work on the roof of a house, fell to the ground, on his knee chiefly. He was brought to the hospital, and I found that the integuments of the knee were torn off, and the patella was broken in several pieces, of which some were removed, so that the joint was completely laid open.

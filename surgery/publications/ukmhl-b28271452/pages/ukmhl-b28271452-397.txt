SUEGICAL PEACTICE. 343 are included the syphilitic affections of bones and periosteum; and to this class I refer the ulceration which forms at the back of the pharynx. In the third stage we include diseases of the bony structure of the nose; but when these bones are diseased, we never find an ulcer of the tonsils or of the velum; and on the other hand, I have hardly ever seen ulcer- ation at the back of the pharynx without disease of the nasal bones. I have seen these venereal ulcers at the back of the pharynx go on to such a depth, as to interest the bodies of the vertebrm, and end in syphi- litic necrosis of them. In this class I am inclined to place those sores which form in the scalp, rather than in the second, for when allowed to take their course they involve the pericranium and the bone. There are sores presenting themselves in the limbs, which, as I have also found them occurring after the patient has been treated for secondary symptoms, I think should be included mth those of the third stage. I allude to such ulcers as take the figure of a horse-shoe. But a more formidable de- scription of sores than these are those which assume a circular form. Each of these ulcers differs in the appearance of the various parts of the sore it- self ; the centre being of a more healthy character than the circumference, where the edges are everted and irritable. When these sores are nu- merous, and spread with rapidity, they present a form of disease of the most serious kind, and place the patient in the greatest danger. If this form of the disease be not rapid in its progress, it may be readily controlled by a steady

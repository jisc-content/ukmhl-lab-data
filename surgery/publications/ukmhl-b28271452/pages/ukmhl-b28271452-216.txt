162 SURGICAL PRACTICE. When the fistula runs up to the upper edge of the sphincter, it is said that, in order that the part may heal, it is necessary that the muscle should be completely divided, as it is the constant action of its fibres that obstructs this process. With my views, I conceive the explanation of the effect of the division of the sphincter to be in the following way. Although some one part of the muscle is detached from its connections by the abscess, yet, as its action is towards the centre of its arrangement, it goes on to exercise its office as a sphincter, and therefore there is not that influence which the main- tenance of function imparts to structure, to excite the healing process, in order that the detached part may regain its adjoining connections. But when the muscle is divided, it has lost its central direction of action, and that power which the preservation of a function exercises over parts springs up to unite the loose edges to the adjoining parts, by which means the utility of the sphincter can only be restored. Before the division, the muscle, although detached on one side, can perform its office; but after the division it cannot act towards the centre so as to close the bowel, the loose edges having no points of connection. Surgeons must have noticed how very soon the edges of the divided fibres become connected with the surrounding parts, and the consolidation of the parts takes place, and how very soon the me- dium assumes all the firmness of a small tendon. Thus the muscle is restored to its original function, and the only alteration that remains is, that the

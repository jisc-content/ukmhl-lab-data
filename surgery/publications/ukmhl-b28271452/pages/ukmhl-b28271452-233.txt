179 SURGICAL PRACTICE. pendent of violence done to the urethra. There are old and very indurated ones, of long standing, and occurring in various and uncertain parts of the urethra, which are benefited by the use of metallic bougies, and by the pressure they make upon the parts : but in the irritable stricture, I am confi- dent that it is not cured in the best way by dis- tention and pressure. I find, if I can once get into the bladder the finest instrument of the catgut kind, I have never been baifled in setting the tube to rights; but this confidence rests upon the fact that the bougie should pass absolutely through the whole urethra, and clearly into the bladder. This accomplished, the patient passes a slender stream, with less straining and more comfort than he did be- fore. On the contrary, I have generally found that when I have passed an instrument only just into the stricture, and even forced it through as far as pos- sible without injuring the membrane, but not into the bladder, that so far from the patient passing his urine better after the operation, he has had much more ditficulty, and sometimes altogether a stoppage. These facts prove that the effect that bougies have on the parts is not that strictures of the ordinary kind are cured by pressure, al- though pressure may for a time dilate the mere contraction, but that there is an influence arising out of the sympathies of the tube which presents itself as a cause, by which a striking and permanent relief is produced in the stricture by a small bougie gently gliding through the prostatic portion of the urethra and fairly entering the bladder ; whilst,

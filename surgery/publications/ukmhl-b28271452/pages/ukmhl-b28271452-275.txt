221 SURGICAL PRACTICE. out of tying both the radial and ulnar artery, for the purpose of stopping bleeding from the arch. Now the long time employed in seeking for the divided artery in this part occasions great disturbance in the parts, and particularly as the tendons of the muscles are so obnoxious in the search, that even if the arteries are secured, yet the disturbance must very likely lead to the formation of extended sup- purations, and ultimately to adhesions between the tendons and the adjacent parts; and this will certainly haj)]3en if the injurious effect of pressure of bandages be added to such a wound. Where the bleeding from these arteries is-stopped by what is usually understood by the force of pressure, I conceive that serious inconvenience will arise from the use of it by the production of adhesions be- tween the adjacent tendons and the other parts, thus impairing the use of the hand for a long while, if not permanently. I have seen this hap- pen, but on the plan I advocate there is no pressure beyond the point of the bleeding vessel, and the rest of the wound being left free and relieved from all compression, heals even better than in the other case, and without producing any agglutinations of the structures. With this simple and certain ex- pedient at hand, how preposterous must it be to tie the radial and ulnar arteries to arrest the hiemorrhage from arteries in the hand. ihe rupture of a superficial vein of the lower ex- tremity is not unfrequently a case offering itself at the hospital. The large quantity of blood often lost in this way makes them very important cases.

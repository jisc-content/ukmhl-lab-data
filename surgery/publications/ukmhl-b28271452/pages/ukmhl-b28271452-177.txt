1 SUliGICAL PRACTICE. 123 severe shock. Thus, besides the degree and the quality of the local injury, we have need, in order to exercise a sound judgment, to know the habits of the indhddual. I have already adverted to the position, when speaking of simple fractures; and when the wound will alloAV us to place the limb on the side, I am convinced of the advantages of this way of placing it. The bent position seems to be that which is most in the order of nature for the economy of the limb as a whole, to leave undisturbed those influences which the preservation of functions may have over the reparation of parts. The limb lies in a greater staf^ of repose — the bearing is diffused more equably — it is kept in a state of quietude by less apparatus or restraint, which are always most injurious in interfering with the freedom of the circulation in the parts, than in any other position; and in addition to what I have stated before, the limb in this way is less influenced by the movements of the body. The limb being placed in the best posi- tion the surgeon can obtain, it is then, unlike the simple fracture which may be daily rectified from any errors of position with impunity, to remain most perfectly undisturbed until the suppurative stage has commenced. No circumstance should induce the surgeon to disturb it at all, till then. Such a step will often be equal to a deadly blow, carrying with it destruction of life. The surgeon is not to busy himself about the unsatisfactory arrangement of the bones, whether in the crooked- ness or the twisting of them. The safety of the

The formation of this abscess does not take place, and present in the adipose structure surrounding the rectum, but along the membranous connections of the tube itself. It usu- ally opens without causing pain to the patient; and when explored it is found that the probe passes not into the fatty substance in the neigh- bourhood, but into the tissue between the sphincter and the membrane of the rectum. It occasionally passes on the outside of the sphincter, and some- times it opens into the rectum, although but sel- dom. The pus discharged from it has not the character of healthy discharge. This complaint is almost always accompanied, and I believe produced, by diseased lungs. I have rarely found that the primary disease was in the liver. The probe may be passed up for a long way, and the finger in the rectum feels it with only the membrane of the bowel between it and the metal. The surgeon has only to take care that the opening is sufficient to allow the discharge to have a ready exit. Any attempt to cure this complaint by the means of an operation is fruitless, and is merely tormenting the patient, whose life is already in imminent danger. I should have said, that, in the other case, when the state of the parts is healthy, the stimulus of the fieces, when they get into the svound, by no means prevents the healing process. If the wound be irritable, they of course add much to the degree of uneasiness. But an abscess of a more formidable character is that where not only on one side but around the

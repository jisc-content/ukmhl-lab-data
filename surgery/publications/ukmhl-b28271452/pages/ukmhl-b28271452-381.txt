327 SURGICAL PRACTICE. day her mouth became affected; the symptoms altogether then changed, and not many hours after quite left her. The wound healed very quickly for such a case, as she was very soon free from the artificial anus. In another more recent case of operation for femoral hernia, the symptoms of peritonitis were severe, although there was no slough of the bowel. I put her upon mercury in an active form, and on the third day the tension and the pain of the abdomen began to subside, almost at the instant that the mouth began to get sore; and she did quite well. These cases are in conformity with the influence of this metal upon serous membranes, and the safety of the patients arose out of their sus- ceptibility to the influence of it. But, in many cases, perhaps, this influence may not be set up in time to avert death, by moderating the peritonitis early enough, which event I have observed happens for the most part about the fifth day. I have, of late, always administered mercury after every operation for hernia. It might be an advantageous step to have recourse to mercury at the earliest moment, and before even the operation may be decided upon, as by this proceeding the inflammation may be kept doAvn to the lowest scale of activity, at the earliest possible period. It might even happen that the difficulty of the return may be so far dimi- nished by preserving the parts from inflammation, that the protrusion may be got up by the ordinary means. If this practice were to be adopted by using the mercurial unction, the stomach and bowels would not lie interfered with.

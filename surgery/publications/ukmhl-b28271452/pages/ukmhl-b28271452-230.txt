SURGICAL PRACTICE. 17G volving the bladder, so that there was at length a communication between the two receptacles. The annular stricture is also of uncertain issue. I have divided this contraction, but not with the advantage I calculated upon. Of course one great point in all strictures of this part is that of repose of the bowel, and removal of all stimulus from it in the form of faeces. The washing out of the tube is one of the chief points in the management of the case.

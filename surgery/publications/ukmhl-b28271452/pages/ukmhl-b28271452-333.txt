279 SURGICAL PRACTICE. T 4 ing parts, supposing that this would facilitate the healing; but in advising this practice it was overlooked that the difficulty arises from the quality of the parts, the one being in a healthy, and the other in a diseased state, and therefore incapable of entering into the necessary associated actions. This state of disease, whether the fungus be re- moved or not, is followed by the wasting of the glandular structure of the organ. In seeking some of the conditions, which the series of local affections of scrofula seem to point out, I have insisted that one of these is the liability to change of seat; and it may well be suggested by an inquirer, whether this change of locality may be effected by artificial means, and the local disease be removed from one affected part to another of less importance. An investigation that could lead to an affirmative result on this point must be of interest to the surgeon. We have instances of the translation from a greater to a less state of disease in some of the joints, par- ticularly in the hip. In the management of these cases we often find that after a slow progress of im- provement the joint mil more rapidly advance than before, and we then find that a formation of matter has commenced just below it, usually on the outer side of the thigh, but sometimes on the inner part near the adductor muscles. And as this formation becomes fairly developed the joint aj^pears quite relieved, no pain nor tenderness remains, and the limb can be freely moved in every direction. This relief of the joint by translation most commonly

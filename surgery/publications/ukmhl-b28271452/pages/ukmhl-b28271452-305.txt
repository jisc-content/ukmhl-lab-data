251 SURGICAL PRACTICE. that when healed he would not be able to stand upright. However, this extensive ulcer did heal, leaving but little scar and no contraction, and he has regained perfect freedom of motion of the limb in every direction. This substratum of thickened tissue, by binding to itself the edges of the sore, is most adverse to the ready healing of burns, when large and deep. We often find that these sores will close up to a certain point, and then fairly stand still, although all the varieties of stimulating applications and other resources of surgery have been resorted to. Still, in the course of time, I have often seen these large unpromising sores heal: probably, by slow absorp- tion, the edges get freed from their close connection and are allowed to approximate. In lean subjects, in whom the integuments are very thin, the influence of the heat in altering the condition of the struc- tures will extend through all the layers of the integumental covering, and therefore the sore will be impeded in contracting. On the contrary, in those who are fat, there will be some strata little, if at all, acted upon, thus more readily allowing the ordinary healing process to take place. I have observed that, in children, if the subject be fat, the process of healing in burns goes on particu- larly favourably, even in very large burns, so as to close up without diminution in the rate of healing. Of course these fat subjects generally are more robust than the lean, and this circumstance must have its weight in the view of the subject. A few years ago a young man presented himself

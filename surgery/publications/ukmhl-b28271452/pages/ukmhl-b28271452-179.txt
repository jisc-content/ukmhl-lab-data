SURGICAL PRACTICE. 125 leolus became denuded, and necrosed, from tbe loss of its periosteum. A suggestion adopted was to saw off this portion; this local jarring produced great disturbance generally, and the patient died. The case had previously been doing exceedingly well. By closely watching and arresting with stimuli the failing powers, the period of suppuration ar- rives ; but here we sometimes find that, instead of the free and healthy formation of granulation, the wound puts forth no sign of vigor, but looks inert, and covered with an orange-coloured deposit. Con- current with this state of the local derangement, we find that the secretions are bad, and that the pa- tient has no appetite; that he is sleepless, and un- comfortable in his feelings; he is really in the very first onset of erysipelas. The surgeon has time for arresting the advance of such an attack; but this is only to be done by promptly directing his atten- tion to securing a return of the healthy state of the secretions: every other intention should give way to this one. If this be effected, he will see a free secretion of healthy pus from the wound, and a return to comparative comfort of feelings, to appetite, and to vigor.

This active state is usually transitory, and is only a step towards the

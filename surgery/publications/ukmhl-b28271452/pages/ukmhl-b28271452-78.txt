24 SUEGICAL PEACTICE. attempted, but only to prove the impossibility of accomplishing it. But what these irregular me- chanical means are powerless to effect, the muscles of the part most readily accomplish. The fact is, that the surgeon does not complete the reduction of recent luxations. The bone is kept in the dis- placed position by the inordinate action of muscles, excited by the derangement in their associated mode of action. If the surgeon can, by his mani- pulation, bring the displaced head so near the socket, that a proximity to the wonted centre of action is obtained, not only do the opposing forces cease, but all the muscles that remain unhurt con- spire consentaneously and violently to draw the bone to its place. The final act in the reduc- tion into the joint is to restore the length of the limb to its proper state, that is, to shorten it; so the last effort for reduction is a motion contrary to that which the surgeon is making in his trac- tion ; and he is made sensible of this sudden retreat of the bone, although he is keeping up the full force of his traction. His efforts are limited to that of drawing the bone so near to the glenoid cavity, as to bring the muscles into a situation to resume that association in which all their actions have been accustomed to take place. This explanation of the combination in the ac- tion of the muscles, by which the completion of the reduction is efiPected, accounts for the distinc- tion between the recent and the old dislocation. In the former, the muscles finally accomplish the purpose which the operator cannot fully complete;

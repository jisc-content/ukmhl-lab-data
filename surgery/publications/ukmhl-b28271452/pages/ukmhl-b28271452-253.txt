SURGICAL PRACTICE. 19il means the least irritating, and by passing the instrument when it is wanted, and not by keep- ing it constantly in the bladder, which, in the tender state of the gland, must be a source of great irritation. In reverting to the progress of this affection, it may be probably explained by the fact that the power of the bladder for evacuating the whole of the urine soon becomes Aveakened as the prostate gland is enlarging ; so that after mic- turition, there is a certain quantity of urine still left, which abides there without exacting the mus- cular fibres of the jiart to contract upon it. It is also probable that at all ages there is a point of distention to which the bladder must be subject before the organ is excited to detrude the fluid. If we suppose that the point at which the quantity of fluid excites the bladder to act, remains the same, and the residuum goes on increasing, then the dif- ference betAveen the residuum and the excitins: quantity must go on lessening. Thus if the blad- der has generally been impatient Avhen distended by eight ounces of fluid, and it has a residuum left of six ounces, then it becomes uneasy when only tAVO ounces are added to that Avhich is left; this Avill account for the frequent desire of making water as life advances. And if this residuum is further increased, and the difference so lessoned, that the constant contents coincide Avith that quan- tity Avhich has been the habitual excitement to the bladder to relieve itself, then another order of things takes place. Every drop that noAV falls into the cavity is at the same time producing a o 4

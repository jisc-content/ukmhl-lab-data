183 SURGICAL PRACTICE. N 4 on the slightest touch. This is generally obedient to treatment, and is relieved when a wax bougie can be got into the bladder. In the observations I am about to make on those important cases which are the consequences of strictures of the urethra in adjacent parts, I must advert to one point, that this canal being one part of a system adapted for collecting and expel- ling the urine, the whole economy of this system must have a mutual partici]3ation in their several functions; and as these functions are associated, their order and arrangement may be altogether changed by any infraction that occurs in one.

If a surgeon deems it advisable to keep in the bladder a catheter, that the urine may flow through it, he, in a very few days, finds that the urine not only passes through the instrument, but also by the side of it, so that the urethra does not forego its functions.

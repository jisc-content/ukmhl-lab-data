This is, indeed, a manifestation of the scrofulous condition of the con- stitution ; but it is so far a better state of things, as it is a change from a more important to a less evil. The same change of the seat of the affection takes place in the psoas abscess.

When the patient says that he has had lumbago previously, great feeling of weakness in the loins, and indisposition to move about, upon the formation of the matter all these sensations are relieved, if they do not entirely cease. The abscess is a derivation from the disease of the bones which had been taking place, and which is now converted in a new form to another situation. This is so far an improved change, that if the abscess can be saved from a permanent opening, the patient will get well with less serious injury to structures than if the disease had gone on continuously in the bones.

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 153 best local treatment consists in the application to the part of alteratives; merely soothing the parts does little. Of course, rest is absolutely required. Furuncle, or boil, is pathologically an important subject for investigation, as it certainly advances a step towards the inquiry into the conditions of carbuncle. I have often seen carbuncle and boils accompanying each other; the essential quality of each is the slough, however small in the boil, of the cellular tissue. In the boil we have this core surrounded by textures of vigorous life, and there- fore it terminates in an abscess of a slight character, and the surface of the cutis opens to discharge the slough. When this is removed, the sore quickly heals. Boils run out into a consecutive series, and go on following each other to a lengthened period; and during this time of their prevalence, we find that the least stimulus will bring them out at the place irritated. Thus, if a piece of adhesive plaster be applied to keep some dressing over one boil, it is followed by others at the part the plaster covers. The seat of boils, as of carbuncles, is most com- monly on the back. Furuncle then, as well as carbuncle, seem the result of some atfection in which the skin particularly is the subject, and that part of this organ which may be considered to have the lowest degree of vitality, Avhich is the case in the back. It is most probable, that in the phy- siology of the system of digestion and the elimin- ation of the urine, may be found the origin of this affection. In urticara, and various other affections.

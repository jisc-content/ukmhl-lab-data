206 SURGICAL PRACTICE. in any state of the parts, the instrument may readily pass into the reetum. This I have seen very often done by those who do not attend to the points I have laid down. Therefore in young sub- jects the operator ought always to pass his finger into the rectum to guide the instrument through the sharp turn, which the narrow pelvis causes, when it has arrived under the pubis. Now this happens commonly without the surgeon being aware of it, because it is reallv an accident followed by no inconvenience ; the puncture into the rectum closes very quickty. This is another instance of the influence of the power of conservancy for pre- serving functions. AVe find in children a readiness for calculi to pass into the urethra from the bladder, and to change their situation from time to time, as we often find in the bladder a large calicaulus with a projecting part that has laid in the urethra. In this age also there are often found calculi of some size fairly advanced in the urethra: I have removed by incision several, and although in one case the stone was as large as a full-sized filbert, and of course required rather a large cut, yet the part, in conformity with the power of conservancy, most readily healed. The removal of them by incision is far preferable to the teazing, and often ineffectual attempts, of withdrawing them by means of the forceps. AVhen the calculi lodge in the urethra of children there is generally a free channel left open by their sides, for the passage of the urine. I shall add that in sounding children with stone in the

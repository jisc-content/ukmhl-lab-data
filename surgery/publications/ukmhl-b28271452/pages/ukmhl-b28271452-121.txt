SURGICAL TRACTICE. 67 the curative process. This being done, we find the next step that is carried on is that the rough edges of the broken parts are absorbed and bevelled olF, After this, these edges are gradually brought to- wards each other, by means of that medium which is begun to be formed by which the fracture is to be united. Here we see, quietly going on, an example of a process which, in surgical pathology, is often brought under our observation. It is, that the medium of union, in parts separated, is the means also of apf>roximating the original parts that are removed from each other. In cases of loss of cutis, the sore is not so much closed by the breadth of the granulations, as that these, in their forma- tion, are gifted with the power of bringing the edges of the original parts of the cutis close to each other. In the fracture of the patella, the muscles will not offer the least obstacle to the approximation of the broken parts. Every system of parts seems to be protected by an influence which is to insure the welfare of their functions; and as we know of no parts which may not deve- lope themselves into a system if scientifically in- vestigated, so we cannot conceive that the con- servative power can fail to re-establish all the deficiencies in structures that are essential to the functions of parts. In the fracture of the patella there is a provision for the preservation of the functions of the knee-joint. The medium that is formed to connect the broken bones is really the mechanism that will draw the parts together; and as this medium is formed for this purpose, then F 2

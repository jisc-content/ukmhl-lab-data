45 SUEGICAL PEACTICE. I have seen as strictly causing wry-neck, is, when the strong sheath formed by the deep cervical fascim, to enclose the sterno-cleido-inastoid muscle has been defective so as to allow the muscle, when in action, to draw the mastoid process over the sterno-clavicular joint. All other cases have usually been those of some thickening about the vertebrae. The very numerous cases of broken ribs which a large hospital produces, of course alford means of drawing inferences of a practical advantage in those cases. The frequency of the injury, and the readiness with which the union takes place, make surgeons leave these cases to a matter-of-course treatment, and do not view them as of imjDortance, where the bone is simply broken. The occurrence of the fracture at or near the angle is not so com- mon as in a more anterior situation; but this seat of injury at the angle gives more pain, and is less obscure to discover than the latter. In the front, by means of the cartilages, there is more elasticity, and therefore a compensating power for saving the motion between the two portions ; but behind the ribs have a greater latitude of mo- tion in the dilatation of the chest, and therefore there is more pain. When emphysema occurs, it is usually in fractures of the upper ribs. In ex- piration, when the atmosphere presses equably on the whole chest, no displacement takes j)lace ; but in inspiration, when the whole ribs are drawn upwards and pressed outwards, the parts of the rib are displaced, and then this fracture is most

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 29G and tliat loose state of the ligaments, which takes place when the cartilages are destroyed, and con- tinues until the articulating surfaces become smooth, will, as the improvement goes on, be changed to the reduced length which is necessary to brace the bones for all the purposes of a perfect ginglymoid joint. These cases, in the success of their recovery, fully display the great advantages of constant quietude and immobility in all affections of joints. We find the greatest number of cases of disease of the hip-joint occurring in very young children, not but that the affection occasionally presents itself in both sexes, in a more advanced period of the scrofulous era. The attention of the parent of the child is first drawn to the way in which it is observed to limp a little in walking, and it is also noticed that the child is more than usually restless at night. The surgeon at once infers from this limj), that some disturbance is going on either in the knee or hip. The nature of the complaint may be unequivocally determined, by placing the patient on his face, and then com- paring the latitude of motion of the femur on both sides, first bringing the thighs as far back as they will each go, and then by rotating each on its axis. On the diseased side the surgeon will find each of these motions limited. There will be pain probably on pressing over the joint in the groin, and also behind the trochanter major. This dimi- nution in the latitude of motion probably arises from some thickening set up for the purpose of protecting the synovial membrane, as we see

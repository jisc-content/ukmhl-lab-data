SUEGICAL J^EACTICE. 334 it might be inferred that there are varieties of chancres. From the observations I have made I do not recognise this supposed variety, and I can- not conceive that it should be found in the natural course of things. We find that the character of the variolous pustule and of the vaccine vesicle is peculiar as well as uniform, each kind differing in the alteration ]3roduced in the structure of the cutis Avhere they occur. When completely formed, these become adventitious organs, calculated for the development of a series of constitutional affec- tions, each preserving its structural individuality, and each calculated for the production of its own peculiar manifestations. Thus a chancre is the organ in which the poison when inserted is kept up, and which if left unaltered, establishes a re- gular train of symptoms invading other parts in succession. The establishment of the organ in the vaccine disease consists in a process which unfolds the cellular arrangement of the structure of the cutis, and the peculiar secretion which has the property of communicating the disease is depo- sited in the cells. In the same way, analogous changes may be described of the variolous pustule, although the construction of the organ is different. These local changes in them seem to be limited in their duration to the formation of the organ for con- tinuing the disease, for the local machinery disap- pears after the secretion has fully acquired the com- municating principle. We have in the chancre also a peculiar con- struction of an organ, differing indeed from those which are alluded to above, inasmuch as the poi-

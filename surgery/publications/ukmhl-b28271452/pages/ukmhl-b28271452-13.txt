CLASSED AS A SCIENCE. vii A 4 fording increased benefit to the public, by infusing into their practice the powerful aids that real sci- ence must necessarily impart to it. In centralising those glimmerings which are emitted from menâ€™s minds, when they speak of science, we discover that they evidently calculate upon some intellectual elaboration for educing its principles; and in this way allusion is made to the abstract sciences, as indicating some intel- lectual processes, independent of, or abstracted from matter, and not that intelligence of it, derived merely from the way it acts upon the senses. Surgeons, in making this kind of reference, often speak in a way, indicating that they felt that their branch of natural knowledge could never reach to the perfect state of real science; but that it might partake of some of its invaluable qualities, derived to it by a sort of collateral connection. Science is absolute, and its stream flows unalterably, retained in its secure banks, which admit no oozings of impure waters to sully its pellucid stream. Whenever the question of science is discussed, there is always an allusion made to the mathe- matics, which is represented as a branch of intel- ligence pre-eminently scientific, but of an order so superior and distinct, that the understand- ing cannot be supposed to attain to an equal degree of scientific perfection in any branch of natural knowledge. The whole bearings of the question have not been sufiiciently entered upon to

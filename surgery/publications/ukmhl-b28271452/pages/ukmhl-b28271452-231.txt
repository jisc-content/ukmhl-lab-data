177 SURGICAL PRACTICE. Thus to take a case not uncommon : a patient has a certain amount of irritation, both in the fre- quency and in the sensation, on passing water; and his attendant passes a bougie, and finds it stopped at the common seat of stricture: he rests a minute, and the instrument passes freely into the bladder, producing at the same time an acute fiery pain ; the patient finds a certain amount of relief, and readily repeats the visit for the operation; but the surgeon finds after a few trials that the bougie meets with an obstacle about four inches down the 2iassage: this gives the same pain as was 2>roduced in the further j)art on the first introduction; the s]3asm ceases, and the instrument jDasses on to the bladder without meeting with the least delay at the usual seat of stricture, and without giving 2)ain there. This j^roves that there is a mutual reci- procity of excitement between these two 2>arts of the urethra, by which the irritation of one 2>art may alternate with another. It has often occurred that patients have come to me with retention of urine without stricture: I have ]3assed a bougie, and on withdrawing it the water has readily flowed, and for the time the jiatient has been cured ; but the condition of this success is, that the bougie should be passed fairly into the bladder. The ternjDorary stricture has given way, not because the instrument has passed through the part at Avhich it stopj)cd, but because it has j^assed over, and diminished the excitability of that 2>RTt near the Idadder, with which the membrane at the usual seat of stricture symjiathises.

SURGICAL TRACTTCE. 234 passed off, the pressure of a bandage often brings up the power of the circulation in the limb to the healthy standard. In the list of sores of the leg I wish to place a very annoying one, both to the patient and to the surgeon; and the more so, as it is one for which the patient is apt to think the origin too trifling to be followed by any trouble. It has its origin in a blow upon the shin, probably so slight as hardly to make the patient aware of injury; but the integu- ment has been much bruised between the bone and the obnoxious hard body; and this quantity of vio- lence has really produced a small gangrene of the cutis, perhaps no larger than a sixpence ; and in a few days this becomes very painful, particularly on hanging the limb down, and in walking; which always occurs when a dead part hangs, as it were, upon a living one.

It becomes so quietly associated with the whole collections of systems that it subsides into the condition of an ordinary function. When disturbances are pro- duced, and extraordinary functions are called into action, these will become associated with the natural functions, sinking into an equal tenour with them, so that the character of the whole system becomes that of health. But when the injury is restored, the whole system imperceptibly relieves itself of the extraordinary functions that have been brought into operation. There is necessity, in ordinary states, for the observance of repose, in order that the full and equable powers of reparation may be developed; and as this often necessarily infers the repose of the whole body, I must advert to what is the consequence of this state being implicitly com- plied with.

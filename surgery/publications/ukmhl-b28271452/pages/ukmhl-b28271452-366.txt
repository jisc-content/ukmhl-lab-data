312 SURGICAL PRACTICE. was foinicl to be a malignant tumor of the dura mater; and, besides projecting outwards through the bone, had also pressed the brain inwards, so as to form quite a hollow for its reception. The whole of the pressure was from before backwards, in a line at right angles to the vertical line. To this I attribute the absence of cerebral symptoms. His death seemed to depend upon exhaustion, as he suffered from nothing like the usual effects of pressure on the brain. If a blow be made upon the vertex of the skull, whether by the patient falling upon this ]3art, or by the impetus of a moving body, the force may be expended upon, and lost, in the elastic quality of the bones by which a vibration is produced. The effect of this is to cause a serious concussion of the brain. But if the violence is very great, so that it does not expend its force in this way, then the arched form of the parietal bones which form a cupola, and which is preserved compact by the temporal bones, transmits the impetus to the base of the cranium. In this way it is, that fractures at the base of the cranium are produced ; and it must be remembered that fractures often occur at the base without the least appearance of contusion or injury to the scalp. Fractures of the skull form a small part of the injuries of the head; but amongst fractures those of the base make a considerable proportion of those which we have the opportunity of ex- amining after death. But I feel strongly that many of such fractures do recover. I have seen patients

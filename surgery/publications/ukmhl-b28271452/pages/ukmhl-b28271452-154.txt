As the practice of surgerj^, in a great degree, is made up of the cognizance of disturbances, and of the new functions required for their reparation, so it presents to the surgeonâ€™s notice the different qualities of endowed life. We see in the influence of stimuli, and in the exercise of the functions for relief, varieties which can be only referable to these differences ; so in the multitude of children burnt or scalded, we find a vast difference in the effects produced by the same power of heat. Of course in scalds with boiling water, where there is a limi- tation in the intensity of the heat that produces the mischief, there is less variety in the degrees of in- jury, and this usually does not go beyond the pro- duction of vesications, still sometimes a thin slough is produced even in adults, and more often in chil- dren ; but in denser fluids, such as boiling beer, coffee, soap-lees, this kind of distinction almost always follows. I must here remark that the practitioner is to distinguish between the naturally weak constitu- tion and that which has been impaired by excesses in living. The former will never rise into a state of vigor, yet it will carry on the processes of re- paration quietly and steadily, and will respond to the influence of the aids for improved action. But the impaired constitution, the result of continued irreo-ularity, renounces the full influence of the powers of medicine and diet. We often see patients with such a state of constitution suffering from great injuries, who for some weeks are kept alive by brandy and other stimulants, but who ultimately

But the great point in practice is to reduce to a state of tranquillity all the functions, whether of parts or of the whole s}^s- tem, before we call into action our auxiliaries for increasing power, otherwise these last only add to disturbance and the waste of strength. Bearing in mind these few and simple principles, the surgeon may place himself in a commanding position to meet the circumstances under which a large class of diseases exist. When an excitement is set up that is inordinate for the purposes of reparation, this is to be brought down to the utmost degree of tran- quillity, and then we have the power of raising the curative process, by adjusting the stimulus to the due and responsive evidence of its influence.

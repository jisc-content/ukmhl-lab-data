I have observed that sleep seems one of the most auspicious signs after the operation for hernia. The accession of peritonitis throws over the whole sys- tem of functions a very disturbing influence, pro- ducing anxiety, and therefore sleeplessness, and giving to the complaint its phj'siognomy of danger. When peritonitis sets uj), it seems invariably per- sisting; but yet its fatality does not seem to be regulated by its intensity, as we often have death ensuing where the degree of inflammation is by no means great. It has sometimes seemed to me, that in peritonitis of a low degree of action, the mem- brane may be relieved of this inflammation by merely secreting in a large quantity the usual serous fluid. I have often seen, during an opera- tion, a large quantity of serum pouring out from the abdomen, on which occasions the cases have generally done well, the peritonitis afterwards ap- parently subsiding into a more healthy function. I have no reason to think, from my experience, that peritonitis has been removed by bleeding or by blisters : it seems a disease not to be arrested by any other remedy than mercury, to which I feel assured it will yield. I had a female patient in the hospital a few years ago with femoral hernia, on whom I operated: the bowel was sphacelated, and an arti- ficial opening was left; she had peritonitis to a great degree. I put her upon mercury, and on the third

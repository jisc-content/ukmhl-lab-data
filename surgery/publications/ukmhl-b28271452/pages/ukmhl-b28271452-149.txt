95 SURGICAL PRACTICE. might be anticipated. I had lately a child of five years old, who had swallowed a needle about two inches in length, but the point was fixed into some hard berry. In a few days it passed away very quietly in a motion ; of course, the globular body at one end hastened the passage of it. The practice of surgery presents to us the re- sources of nature of ridding parts of the presence of extraneous bodies by the means of the stimulus of relief. In cases of hemorrhage the surgeon plugs the nostrils. The efiicacy of the operation depends upon the lint he uses being tightly pressed into the posterior nostrils. So it remains for a few days, and then if the surgeon withdraws it, he finds it free from all stricture ; indeed, so loose, that it ’will, perhaps, discharge itself into the pharynx. The bulk of the wadding is the same as when tightly introduced; and so far from having lost any of its parts, it has acquired an addition in the thick mucus with which it is saturated. The fact is, that under the influence of the stimulus of relief, the internal nares have been quietly en- larged. A child was brought to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital with a pebble in the meatus of the ear. I found it of an oblong form, and firmly wedged in. I could get the blades of a small pair of forceps to grasp it when passed over the short diameter, but I could not make it stir. Having the fear before me of doing mischief by using force, I di- rected the mother to bring the child in a fortnight. She did so, and I found the pebble quite loose, so that it might be removed by only a shake of the

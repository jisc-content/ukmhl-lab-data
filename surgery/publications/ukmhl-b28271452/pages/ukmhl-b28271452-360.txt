306 SURGICAL PRACTICE. to the lachrymal sac. It must have been often brought to the observation of surgeons that frac- tures of the nasal bones readily unite; and also, that deformities of the lower jaw produced by in- juries undergo changes by which all irregularities are removed; and, by the assistance of some com- pensating alteration, the imperfection in mastication that otherwise would ensue, has been quite re- moved. In the changes connected with the teeth, all these advantageous adaptations are continually in progress. In transferring the field of observation of the effects of injuries from the face to the scalp, we shall find that the circumstances will accord with the same views. The mechanical principles on which many cir- cumstances connected with wounds of the head depend, do not appear to be attended to by sur- geons. It does not follow that the impetus with which a blow is inflicted, should be expended upon the part stricken. The head, as a mass, is made up of structures of various mechanical qualities; some are soft, some elastic, and some hard with the least degree of elasticity. And in receiving the percussion, the various structures may receive the effects of the blow independent of each other. We also find a difference of the injury in the same struc- ture, arising out of the difference in the way in which any given momentum striking upon the part, is com- pounded. Thus, in two blows, the momentum of each may be the same, although the velocity and quantity of matter may differ, if these powers are reciprocal to each other, and then the efiects of the impetus

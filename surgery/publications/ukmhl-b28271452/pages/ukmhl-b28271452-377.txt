323 SURGICAL PRACTICE. The different effect of the erect position and the reclining is most marked in this complaint. I be- lieve there are many irreducible herniie that may be made to return by a long course of lying in bed. I had one case of a patient who had an irreducible hernia for twenty years, which seemed to be omentum adhering to the sac; it completely went up, sac and all, by lying on his back several weeks, and he was enabled to wear a truss, and by this rendered capable of any manual labour. When the patient lies on his back, the powers of restoration are assisted by the slight influence of gravity which is incessantly promoting an un- observed movement to effect the adjustment, and even the ring will, as I think I have found, en- large itself, on the principle of conservation of the function of the intestinal canal. There appears to be much to learn in the con- siderations that call for the operations in hernia. All surgeons have seen patients who have been operated on very early, lost; and others operated on very late, recover.

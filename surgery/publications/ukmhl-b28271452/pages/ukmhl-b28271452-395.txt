It is not unusual to see a chancre that has quite healed, but owing to the remedy having been left off before the hardness was removed, the sore has broke out again upon the surface of this hard spot. I think it must be allowed on consideration of all the points to which 1 have alluded, that there may follow at least uncertainty and embarrassment in setting about to cure a chancre by caustics or other local means; and in this way incurring a great probability of placing the patient in a dis- tressing position.

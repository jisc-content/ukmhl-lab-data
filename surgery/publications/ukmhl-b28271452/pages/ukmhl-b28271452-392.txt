SURGICAL PRACTICE. 338 to support the presumption that the malignity of the disease is developed by means of the peculiar construction of this hardness. It is not at all unusual to find that as the sore heals the hardness increases ; and I have often noticed that the hard- ness has been greater after the sore has quite healed than at the time when the treatment was begun. But this is not the case if the remedy be pushed on to a powerful degree of action. We also find that the progress of a chancre is slow in pro- portion to the degree of thickening which is esta- blished ; and further, that the sensibility of the sore is less in the same degree: by which it often happens that patients present themselves who have had the disease for many weeks before they are aware of it. In these cases a most vexatious state of things will often take place, which Mr. Hunter has noticed. It is that, however judiciously and steadily the remedy may have been administered ; yet when the chancre is apparently perfectly cured, very quickly after the remedy is suspended, secon- dary symptoms will nevertheless present themselves. It is so much a received opinion in the profes- sion that what are called buboes arise from the ab- sorption of the poison from a chancre, that I may surprise most surgeons by rejecting this supposition. I have observed that the glands are never affected in the insensible kind of chancre, where there is the great hardness, which is admitted to be the charac- teristic of the complaint, and where there is no irri- tation at tlie same time upon the penis. For when the glands are affected in the male, there may always be found an irritable spot in some part of the organ.

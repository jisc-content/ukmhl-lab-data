71 SURGICAL PRACTICE. walking up some steps, when he found he was falling backwards. The muscles most interested in preserving the balance of the body made a sudden exertion, and he felt something give way at one knee, and he fell. He contrived to get upon his legs, and in making an exertion to ba- lance himself, he felt the same sort of snap in the other knee, and he again fell. He was brought home, and sent for me. I readily assured myself that the rectus and crureus were detached from each patella. The bone was entire, and there was a vacuity above the upper edge of the patella, which might lodge m the depression two fingers by breadth. There was a good deal of swelling around the joint. I treated it precisely in the way I have above described for the fracture of the patella, avoiding all bandaging, and relying upon the efficacy of the power of conservancy for carrying on the reparation. In a very short time, a medium was formed, filling u]i the vacuity, and simultaneously the muscles became approximated to the patella: in the course of about six weeks the attachments seemed to have become as perfect as they would have been in the unhurt state, as far as the examination could make outâ€”a result gratifying both to the patient and the surgeon. He was very soon able to walk across his room, and when I saw him a few months after, he told me he could walk nearly as well as ever, with- out the aid of a stick. In this case I presume no surgeon would have put on a bandage, as this could only serve to tilt up the patella, and obstruct the coming down of the muscles to their proper

132 SURGICAL PRACTICE. cesses to go on without inflicting any violence, or deranging their course. In removing a piece of dead bone, we cannot always succeed in taking away every particle; any part, however small, may keep up the same irritation by its presence; and thus no relief wiU be obtained by the operation, but positive injury may be produced. All the bone that is in- jured will, in due time, duly and quietly exfoliate. The compound dislocations of the ankle-joint may be classed with compound fractures. I have already spoken of the great points of treatment in enlarging on the compound fracture of the leg. We have here an instance of the benefit of placing the leg on the side: we see the relief aflbrded by placing muscles in that position in which their actions are least called upon. The way in which the integuments are ruptured causes them to grasp the protruded bone ; a very slight enlargement of the wound allows the bone to be replaced. The wound heals altogether better than in other cases of compound injuries, being made by the bone first stretching the integuments to the utmost before it is pushed through, and thus no contusion has been produced. These injuries have often the most satisfactory termination, even beyond the expecta- tion of the surgeon. Compound fracture of the thigh is by no means so common as that of the leg. As this part of the limb is more enveloped by muscles, so we must have a larger amount of torn and contused soft parts. Thus a greater mischief is produced, requiring more energy in the power of the con-

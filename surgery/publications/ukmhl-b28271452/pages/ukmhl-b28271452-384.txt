SUEGICi\X PRACTICE. 330 very much, in the female, on local measures; but in the male the safe and most effectual way is, to conduct the case upon general principles, and by moderating the symptoms mthout disturbing their course, and not resorting to the specific remedies until a proper time, we shall then rarely fail to cure the disease kindly and without delay. I have constantly seen that if those remedies which are regarded as specific, be thrown in at the earliest period of gonorrhoea, they not only have not had any influence in arresting its course, but that they have afterwards, when resorted to again at a more suitable period, been quite devoid of showing any power of stopping the complaint. Their full efficacy is never so strikingly marked as when administered on the decline of the symptoms; and the success of the treatment is displayed most fully by keeping the active stage stationary in the seat which it first takes possession of, by avoiding every circumstance that can tend to cause a change in its locality. Both sexes are liable to complaints that very closely simulate the gonorrhoeal disease. This occurs to men who have an irritable stricture, or at least an irritable urethra, who find on some excite- ment a sudden appearance of copious discharge; and if it appears after intercourse, it may be so soon as twelve hours, and at once of a purulent cha- racter. It is accompanied with the slightest sensa- tion on passing water, but no distressing pain in case of erection, and the orifice of the urethra is only slightly more red than in the natural state.

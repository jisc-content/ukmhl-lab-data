EXPLAl^ATION OF THE DIAGEAAIS. Fig. 1. — This figure is intended to show not only the way in which the ordinary dislocation of the humerus takes place, but also the circumstances that result from the displacement. A person finding himself falling, and at the same time throw- out his arm to save the fall, places the greater part of the weight of his body upon the hand, and simultaneously the muscles designed for bringing the'arm to the trunk, particu- larly the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, are spontane- ously called into strong action : thus the points of motion of the limb are altogether changed. The centre of motion is now removed from the centre of the head of the humerus to the place of insertion of these two muscles; by which the whole limb becomes a lever of the first kind, the weight of the body resting upon the hand being the moving power. The centre of motion is now transferred below the head, which part is carried downwards, and forcibly pressed into the axilla. In this way all those muscles which are employed by their as- sociated actions to preserve the head in the socket, and to move the limb around its appointed centre of motion, are so deranged and diverted from the order of their proper com- bined actions, that they are excited by this derangement to make a powerful resistance to all the efforts that may be made with a view to the reduction of the bone. Fig. 2. — When the phalanges of the fingers or toes are dislo- cated, the lateral ligaments being entire, the displaced bone is clasped close to the other in a parallel direction ; and there-

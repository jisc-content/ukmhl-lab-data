342 SURGICAL PRACTICE. appeared to me that one kind of eruption is inva- riably accompanied with its peculiar kind of sore in the fauces. But I have observed that the ulcer- ation of the fauces does not accompany the eruption when the iris is inflamed. The influence of mer- cury seems to be more readily apparent in cases of secondary symptoms than in the chancre, and therefore as this medicine is so often given par- tially, irregularly, or inadequately, the secondary symptoms must very often be seen in a way to obscure the real features of the disease. In examining patients with this disease it is not uncommon to find the velum palati inflamed, and no appearance of a sore upon it; in such a state of things the progress of the case will soon present a complete perforation of the part, the inflammation having been hierely the expression of an ulcer which had commenced on the posterior surface of this membrane. There is one circumstance that could not be unexpected, knowing as we do how very pain- fully and distressingly patients swallow who have the membrane of the fauces inflamed, which is, that venereal sores either on the tonsils or on the velum, even if they be large and inflamed, produce little inconvenience of this kind.

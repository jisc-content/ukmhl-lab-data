260 SUKGICAL PRACTICE. usually does well. In the enumeration of chronic abscesses I have not mentioned scrofulous collec- tions of matter; but there is no doubt that many cases of this description may be so classed. The series of grave events that follow in the se- quence of inflammation of the cysts of abscesses, and the increase of liability to danger, when the opening is left unclosed, give importance to the means of ensuring the proper healing of these wounds. It has been proposed, as an ingenious way of evacuating the fluid, to adopt what is called a valvular opening, by which it was supposed that the two edges would have an adaptation of larger breadth of living structure to insure the healing. It was also suggested that by this method there was less liability of air getting into the cavity. These advantages are not found practically to fol- low this method. Flakes of coagulated lymph, or, what often has happened, a piece of fat, are often interposed, and defeat the intention of obtaining speedy union ; but, what is still more likely, in squeezing out the matter in the usual way, the edges of the wound are excited to a state of irri- tation, and, perhaps, secrete serum instead of lymph. At all events, this method does not appear to have any advantage over those previously em- ployed, and the proj^osed improvement has turned out to be fallacious. The state of the patient in irritative fever is, however, so serious, that it is the duty of the surgeon to seek some plan that shall save him from the impending danger of such a con- dition. I have of late years adopted the plan of

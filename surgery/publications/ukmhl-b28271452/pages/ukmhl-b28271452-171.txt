117 SURGICAL PRACTICE. such circumstances, generally exercises its elastic property so much as to grasp tightly the projecting hone. This quality of elasticity is a power which helps exceedingly the process of union, by closing the wound in a Avay that no art can equal. When we let out the fluid of a hydrocele, the scrotum is distended; when the fluid is evacuated, then the corrugation of this structure closes the wound incomparably beyond any contrivance we can apply; and it heals without attracting our observ- ation. In wounds of the lungs the air in the cavity of the pleura produces by its elasticity, better than by any means we could adopt, an effec- tive pressure upon the collapsed lung. I have seen cases of children where nearly half the scalp has been torn off by a force, not first inflicting a contused wound on the lacerated part, but stretch- ing and rending the flap from the other parts, where, Avhen it has been cleansed and laid accu- rately in its place, the edges have ahnost all healed by the first intention. I have seen the tarsal bones violently separated, and the astragalus pushed through the sldn, when the wound has healed readily, and Avith the least possible general disturbance. In short, this way of causing a Avound in the integuments, seems to inflict upon the part only the first degree of disturbance ; that is, to induce the simple action of immediate relief. Of course, in stating these cases, I assume that the conditions are not exceeded; that is, that there are no violent contusions also added to the rent. In stating that there is a marked difference

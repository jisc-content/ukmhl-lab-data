SURGICAL PRACTICE. 297 that at the same time there is a wasting of the muscles that immediately surround the joint, which is another provision for keeping the joint as free as possible from the irritation of motion, by Avhich the disease may possibly be prevented from advancing so fast as it otherwise might do. AVhen the proper treatment is early adopted, the patient will often quite recover, and have the full and perfect use of the joint. And, further, there is occa- sionally a translation, by which the pain and stilF- ness quite leave the joint, and an abscess makes its appearance in some of the neighbouring structures, which event is a real derivation of the complaint. If the disease advances so far that a destructive process commences in the essential structures of the joint, then the ligaments become so far altered that the head of the femur will be displaced from its natural position, and the limb will also assume the appearance which is seen on the ordinary dislocation of the femur when the head is on the ilium, the thigh of the diseased side will cross the other, and the toes be turned to the tarsus of the other foot. Before or at least whilst this change is going on, the pain and general irritation increase ; but after the displacement has taken place, then both the pain diminishes, and the general state of the constitution becomes comparatively quiet; and in the usual farther course of these complaints the pa- tient recovers, with this sort of dislocation remain- ing through life. This displacement is, indeed, an improved state of things as to the effects of the disease, and calcidated to give ease to the patient,

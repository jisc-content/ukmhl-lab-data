77 SURGICAL PRACTICE. may have accustomed liis muscles to act. Thus the leg of a soldier requires a straighter posture than that of a waterman, for repose. I am far from thinldng that pressure over muscles is calculated to quiet them, I think it really irritates and makes them fidgety; inasmuch as in a limb the muscles and the bones in their functions form a system of their own, and have a principle of conservancy between each mutually established; and for the duly carrying out the processes of reparation, the work of nature requires repose, as the first step to allow her efforts a due course of action. In healthy patients, where injury is to be repaired, the business of surgery is solely to guard against those disturb- ances that may interfere with the necessary pro- cesses. The common expression of relaxation of muscles, on the occasions in which it is usually used, should mean the placing the limb in such a position that the whole association of relations should be quiescent. If a broken leg be put up in any given way, and after a fortnight, more or less, the surgeon wishes to change this way, as for instance, from the position on the back to that on the side, he submits his patient to disquietude, and perhaps torment. The Avork of reparation has begun in one way, under the position imposed upon the limb, and any change of the arrangement under Avhich the power began to operate, interferes with those series of actions, by which they Avere com- menced, and thus inflicts a disturbance calculated to impede the healthy process.

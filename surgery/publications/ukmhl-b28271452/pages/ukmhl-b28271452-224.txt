170 SURGICAL PRACTICE. jected downwards within the grasp of the sphincter, which produces one of the most tormenting affections that the surgeon has to deal with. This fold, being nipped by the sphincter, gives a most distressing pain, which lasts until it gets released; and the patient often is obliged to throw himself upon a bed, and rest in torture a certain time before he is relieved by the fold being drawn up. When this is effected, he usually feels not the least of his previous sufferings. Of course the treatment is chiefly the replacing the part by means of a wax bougie, &c. In this case, the part projected down- wards is often the membrane only, and not an internal pile, although occasionally this is also pre- sent. This state of derangement is generally more completely cured than that in which piles form a portion of the prolapsed part, and also leaves the bowel more completely recovered. If there be an enlarged vein in this descending part, then, of course, the formation of internal piles will commence. These increase in size, and, the coats becoming thinner, give way, and bleed, each time they are strangled by the action of the sphinc- ter ; but they still continue as piles when the part is drawn up, and set free from the pressure of this muscle, I believe that all internal piles are the consequence of a loose state of the mucous mem- brane of the rectum. These piles, existing even when the membrane is replaced in its position, offer an obstacle to the passage of formed dejec- tions, which then press the piles forward in their downward course, and thus a large mass is forced

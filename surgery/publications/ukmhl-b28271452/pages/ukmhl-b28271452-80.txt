26 SURGICAL PRACTICE. the outward pressure greater, few dislocations would resist this way of reduction. This observation leads to the subject of long- standing luxations. Some years ago, a patient was brought from the country into St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, who had a dislocation of the thigh of some weeks’ duration. The first surgeon who saw him had not detected the luxation. After some weeks a second surgeon saw him, and at once knew what had happened. He adopted the usual means for reduction without success. The patient was then, at the end of six weeks, sent to London. I adopted the usual plan of extension from a fixed point, and readily brought the head to the natural range of the joint; but no contrivance could shoot the head of the femur into the acetabulum. I was not contented with one trial; I failed in at least three. This occurrence led me to reflect on the principles on which the treatment of dislocations rest. I am now convinced, that in recent luxations there is a power independent of the operator, which can, in spite of the force he employs, and in opposition to the direction of it, thrust the bone into its place; so that it is really the absence of this power of muscles, that is the reason why old luxations of this sort are not reduced in the way the operation is usually conducted. I have said much of the system of motions that arise out of the combinations of muscles acting by consent, in relation to a centre of motion. This consentaneity of action is not only persistant and complete, Avhilst the muscles have this centre about

SURGICAL RRACTICE, 22 break the fall, and to save his body from injury ; it is necessary for this end, that those muscles which usually draw the arm to the side should be put into powerful action, which has the effect of changing the centre of motion from the joint, to the axis of motion at the point where these muscles, chiefly the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi are inserted, which is a place below the joint. Thus the limb forms a lever of the first kind, the weight of the body coming upon the hand is the moving power, the point of insertion of these two muscles is the axis, and the power of retaining the head of the bone is the obstacle to be overcome. The head is in this manner tilted out of the socket. The direction in which the head of the bone is throvm will vary as the arm is forward or backward, in reference to the lateral line of the trunk at the time Avhen the person falls. {Fig. 1.) The derangement in which the parts of the joint are now placed, clearly shows the features of the case. The head being removed into the axilla, the distance between the acromion and the external condyle is increased. The deltoid muscle has lost its usual centre of motion, and is therefore strongly excited to inordinate action. The same altered state of the centre of motion and derangement of the asso- ciated actions influence the other muscles, and thus there is a combination of powers calculated to resist the restoration of the head. The arm is poised in its position, with the centre of motion removed from its proper place ; so that we readily recognise, in the condition of tlie parts, tlic clia- racter of the dislocation : the elongation of the

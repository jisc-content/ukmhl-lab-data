118 SURGICAL PRACTICE. between severe injuries in the first period when the integuments are comparatively but little af- fected, and in those Avhere they are much injured, I approach to the consideration of that difference which we find between simple and compound frac- tures. Amongst the many cases of broken legs continually occurring, there are those of both these classes in which the degree of the violence and the mode of its application are so nearly equal, that the presence of an external wound must be regarded as the essential characteristic of the compound frac- ture. This injury has not of late years been so formidable to the surgeon as formerly; and I can safely say, that it has been very rare, for many years, that I have had occasion to amputate for such injuries after I have judged the case one for preserving the limb. I have already said that it is necessary that the surgeon should acquaint himself as much as possible with the manner in which the injury has been produced, not only that he may form some estimation of the force emjiloyed, but also of the direction in which it was applied. Thus I need hardly say that the force may be applied to the part broken, or to the extremities. Thus, if a carriage pass over the leg, Ave have a vast contusion of the parts, and perhaps a crushing of the bones, but no displacement to any amount; yet Ave have a comj)lexity of derangements, and a protracted process for recovery. If the force be applied laterally, then Ave have to refer to this in reducing the bones to their places. I have already, when speaking of simple frac-

In the first part of the treatment, soothing applications are best suited for relieving the pain, and bringing the surface to a healthy aspect; after which the alterative dressings, such as hydrarg., nitrico-oxyd., most generally answer best. As veins anastomose even in their primitive trunks, a freedom of space always exists for the blood to move into. We find further, that, from their structure, they are more endowed with the power of varying their size than arteries, for the sake of accommodating themselves to their contents. In phlebotomy, and the ordinary injuries of veins, the wounds readil}^ heal, unlike those of arteries. There seems to be, on this account, no difficulty in believing that diseased veins may be restored to their original healthy state, if placed under favour- able circumstances for such a change; that is, if no external cause impedes their functions, or interferes with that legitimate influence which these always exert in restoring the perfection of a part; and thus the veins of the leg, when diseased, will, if the limb is maintained iu the horizontal position, and in perfect repose, gradually recover from the state of thickening, and induration of the valves. This fact I have observed ; but we have practically a difficulty in effecting a perfect cure, as the time for fully producing the benefit must be consider- able. Varicocele is a case especially marking the bene-

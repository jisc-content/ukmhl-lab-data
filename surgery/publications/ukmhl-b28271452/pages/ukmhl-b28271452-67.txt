SURGICAL PRACTICE. 13 to exert, when its usual direction of action about a centre is forcibly changed. I think the best ex- emplification of this is, in that case of rare occur- rence, the dislocation of the patella on its edge. ^Vlien the j>atella is displaced in this way, it sets into action of the most violent kind, those muscles which are the extensors of the leg. Their force is the effect, first, of that irritation which all muscles get when they are thromi out of their ordinary line of action, particularly when they are disturbed in moving round their ordinary axis or centre of motion; but still further, because, when these muscles are called upon, they act most power- fully, or, in other words, they are in the strongest action when the limb is to be straightened, as they are then to balance and support the whole weight of the body, by making a firm pillar of the extremity. Thus in this condition these muscles act with a power that defies all the force that human aid can call into its service. I haA^e seen the utmost exer- tion quite feeble in changing, in the slightest degree, the state the bone was in. Yet we knoAv that in instances where one individual puts forth his whole power in muscular action, he cannot resist the strength of two or more to overcome this power, as is often seen in trials of a clenched fist, &c. The power of many men is not equal to the force of muscles in dislocations. But, nevertheless, the purpose is readily effected, if we avail ourselves of the fact that these muscles only act so poAverfully Avhen in this position, which is that they have Avhen they usually exert their greatest efforts, that is, in

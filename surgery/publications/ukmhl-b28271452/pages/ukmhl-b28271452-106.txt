SURGICAL PRACTICE. 52 limb thrown off, as it were, from the trunk ; and the object is to impose an obstacle to the disturbance of this detached member in the course of the treat- ment. Any apparatus of splints or bandages must rather promote the derangement than otherwise, as the weight already keeps the limb removed from its connection with the trunk. The injury is so close to the centre of gravity of the whole body, that every slight movement must act so as to create motion between the broken parts. But these motions are only likely to take place in those actions where there is a movement forwards. The movements of the head, and of the limbs, are nearly all forward and backward, and all likely to affect the parts broken. In the slightest elevation of the trunk this must happen. While therefore the patient is on the back there is a continual interruption to the steady curative process; but on the side, even in young persons, there are so few lateral move- ments to which he is accustomed, and perhaps not one in which the movement is about the centre of gravity, that in this position there is the least pos- sible interruption to the uniting process. It cer- tainly is a painful position for the first few days, but the uneasiness soon goes off. In this position, as the centre of gravity is directly over the injury, so the whole weight of the body presses on the bones, and keeps them in coaptation ; and even if there Avere any displace- ment, the stimulus of uneasiness is enough to bring the parts into order.

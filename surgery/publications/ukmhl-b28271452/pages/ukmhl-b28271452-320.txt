The fact is, that great mani- festations of the scrofulous constitution may go on, and yet the ordinary processes of health be little disturbed, the powers but little impaired, and the functions of life very little interfered with. As the local affections are found in such a variety of situations, we are not aware that the mere disease, when seated in parts not essential to the main- tenance of the vital functions, ever is destructive to the actual existence of life ; or at least it must go on to derange the structures on which it is im- planted to such a degree, that from any other cause the same series of affections would place the consti- tution, by the great disturbance they create, in im- minent peril. Tubercles, if not in such number or degree as seriously to interfere with the functions of the lungs, do not necessarily endanger life; and we find that scrofulous disease of joints does not influence the system so injuriously as to derange the functions of life, until it has pro- ceeded so far as to destroy the essential structures of the part. It is a fact of daily observation, that the local affections of scrofula do comparatively little affect the general system of the animal functions. I con- tinually see cases in which a joint is diseased, to a degree which in other kinds of complaint would be regarded as of a most fearful extent, where the pa- tient has a tranquil and firm pulse, good tongue, sleeping well and enjoying his meals ; and these patients, with good air and proper nourishment, will,

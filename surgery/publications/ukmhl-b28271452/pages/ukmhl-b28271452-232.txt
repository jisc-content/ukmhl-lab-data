SURGICAL PRACTICE. 178 In recognising the delicacy of the membrane of the urethra, and the association of its parts in their reciprocity of actions, we have data on which to found something like principles, which may explain its derangements. In reference to the first point, the delicacy of the membrane, I am convinced of this fact, from observing the results of the various me- thods that are often adopted in the treatment of the complaint. If in the simple spasmodic stricture a metallic instrument be employed, it must, by its motion, in a degree force its way in the passage of it; and thus the impetus it imparts to the membrane causes it to bleed, making a wound of the urethra; which violence, I conceive, may lay the foundation of a stricture. This stricture does not follow imme- diately the violence, but succeeds in the course of some distant time. I have watched over pa- tients who have had spasmodic stricture for many years, and by the gentle treatment originally adopted I have known them pass through life per- fectly free from annoyance. The metallic instrument bears all down before it, and more surely gets into the bladder than the softer one. The surgeon boasts of his success, and the patient rejoices in the striking evidence of the passage of the instrument into the bladder, and, in his view of the case, this strengthens his best expectations that he will have a speedy cure. And he is perhaps told that the stream of blood that is flowing from the urethra will be only a salutary relief. I am aware that strictures will form quite inde-

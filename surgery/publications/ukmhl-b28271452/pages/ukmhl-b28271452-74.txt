SURGICAL PRACTICE. 20 instances of the stimulus, acting with a little differ- ence, as stimuli for relief. The practice of surgery is much exercised in the full consideration of stimuli, in reference to the powers they excite for the relief of the disturb- ance they produce, either in the simplest degree, or in the most complicate order. The influence of stimuli is for the most part conservative. If the hand be exposed to labour, the cuticle hardens; the conservative influence is seen in the simplest degree. But if this be carried on with increased intensity, or in longer duration, a greater derangement follows; blisters are formed. But even this degree of stimulus brings with it the conservative action, if left quietly to carry on the necessary process. The part stimulated must have a power of responding conformably to the strength of the stimulus, other- wise the stimulus is destructive. In a paralytic subject the stimulus of pressure is beyond the power of the integuments to resist by any action of relief. The surgeon is continually called ujion to calculate those forces by which injuries are produced ; but he is also required to estimate with precision the degree of influence of the stimuli he employs, by the application of which he intends to call forth those living functions, which are to carry on the processes of repair. Having sketched this short outline of some j)ro- positions which may be regarded as preliminaries to practical surgery, I shall now offer my views on the treatment of several cases. It is proper that some definite meaning should be applied to the acceptation of the term dislocation,

25 SURGICAL PRACTICE. in the latter, the operator must adopt measures which are to supply this defect in the assistance of muscular action. There are many opinions respecting the direction in which the traction should be carried on. It may be assumed that luxations generally should be treated in a way that would seem to reverse the steps by which they were produced. With this view the bone should be drawn in the direc- tion in which, when displaced, it lies. But it must be remembered, that the resistance is really owing to the loss of that combination of action which is required in the muscles, arising from their being deprived of that centre around which they act; and the object to be aimed at, is to bring, as p^erfectly as can be, the head into that situation in which they can all, with one consentaneous act, draw the bone into its place in the socket. I believe that even in recent luxations, the traction should be not from one fixed point, but from a moveable one, so as to allow of change of direction. The numerous cases of this kind that are brought to St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital are for the most part reduced by means of the heel in the axilla; which, in fact, applies the traction in the best direction, outwards and downwards; inasmuch as whilst the limb is drawn downwards, the foot pushes the head outwards, and thus the traction is oblique in its direction; it has this advantage, that the foot, by pressing on the inferior costa of the scapula, fixes this bone tolerably well. Probably by increasing the width of the foot, and so making

IX GLASSED AS A SCIENCE. subjects presented to the mind, founded upon self- evident principles, with consequential and clearly connected demonstrations, which collectively amount to a body of demonstrated truths. But this train of operations can be only carried on by the intel- lect, fully and brilliantly shown in mathematical inquiries, so fuUy acknowledged by all; although men, and particularly medical men, continually understand by science that comprehension of things which is obtained by means only* of the senses, but such sources are not admissible in science. The most vague conception of what mathematical science is, must show that all the intelligence* of things which the mere senses can convey will never form a system of demonstrated truths. The most perspicacious representation, derived from the senses, can never implant in the mind a single intellectual truth, which is to become the starting point of science. The anatomist prosecutes with zeal and ability the knowledge of the forms of the animal structure, and by such labours various observers have given different accounts of the muscular fibre, just as new and improved mi- croscopes have come into use. The fact is, that this sort of discovery amounts to nothing, until the mind can elicit all the relations existing between objects, and then it really becomes a scientific enunciation. * Intelligence is meant to imply the degree of the under- standing the mind has of any thing, however imperfect.

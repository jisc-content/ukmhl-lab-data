Where I have had the opportunity of watching patients who have had scrofulous joints removed, they have for the most part lost their lives by phthisis. I have no hesitation in saying that the removal of scrofulous limbs, when the patient has appetite and sleeps well, is far from maintaining the scientific character of the profes- sion. I have been impressed with the greatest regret at so often being unable to persuade mothers who have consulted me for inflamed cer- vical glands in the persons of their daughters, that if an evil is to be attached to them in some form of this complaint, they should be contented that a daughter may be preserved to them at the expense of some disfigurement in the neck of the young lady. And I regard it as a fact, that by the complaint fixing in these parts there is a reasonable assurance that the lungs may continue free from disease.

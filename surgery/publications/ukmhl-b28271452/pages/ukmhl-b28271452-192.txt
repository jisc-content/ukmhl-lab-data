How many cases are spoiled by restless interference! The cases of diseased bone which present at the hospital are very numerous. It is possible to as- sign conditions in the state of the parts that may lead to a clear distinction into classes. But, pro- bably, necrosis is essentially an affection of the periosteum in its various changes, and in the result of those changes upon the bones.

A gentleman built for himself a large house, and constructed a bath next to his study. His delight was to bathe, even in cold weather. The room was not secured from drafts; and one day, in cold weather, he sensibly felt, whilst uncovered and wet, the blast pass over his right shoulder.

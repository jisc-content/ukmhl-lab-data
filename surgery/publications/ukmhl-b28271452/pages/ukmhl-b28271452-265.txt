But this operation, even when happily accomplished, has neither the facility nor the subsequent advantages of the one above the pubes. The cases of fistula lachrymalis that have come under my notice might be divided into two classes. The one depends upon disease of the superior maxillary bone, which arises for the most part in consequence of venereal infections, so that when the specific disease is removed, this form is cured without any further treatment. The other divi- sion is that which depends upon an altered con- dition of the mucous membrane of the nose, by which the nasal ducts, being a continuation of the same membrane, become thickened and blocked up. This membrane varies much in being more or less loose in its connection, and also in the turgid state it may assume, so that it may readily be in a condition to close the nasal duct without there being actual disease in the canal, and thus prevent the passage of the tears downwards. In this way there is an undue pressure on the sac, and thus the first step is established of a series of future stages forming fistula lachrymalis, if not averted. I knew a young lady who was subject to an impetiginous eruption about her lips on one side; this would leave her, and then the mucous membrane of the nostril on that side would become vascular, turgid, and dry, and the sac would become distended, so that she had the tears flowing down the cheek, a

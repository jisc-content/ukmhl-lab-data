SURGICAL PRACTICE. 72 attachments. Long before this case occurred, I had another of the same kind in one knee, in which bandages were used. The recovery Avas slow and imperfect, as the patient could not do without a stick for some years, and the limb re- mained always weak. I have had cases in the hospital where the pa- tella has been crushed into many parts; the integuments torn, and the joint exposed; yet they have got well, leaving the bones of course anchy- losed. It is not unusual for violent injuries to joints to give rise to less disturbing processes in regard to the system, than those of mere puncture, &c. The patella is often luxated, and all the cases that I have seen have been outwards. As the leg in all persons, but particularly in some in a greater degree, makes an angle inwards Avith the thigh, so the attachments of the extensor muscles and the ligament of the patella make an obtuse angle Avith the base of the triangle outwards; and therefore if any part of the connections of the two bones give way, owing to the influence of these muscles, the bone must be carried outwards, as I have always found it. It so readily resumes its place on the limb being placed in repose, that the surgeon does not ahvays witness the displacement; of course there is no difficulty in adjusting this derangement. But there is little prospect of preventing the repe- tition of the luxation, as the restraining structures of the patella laterally are not restored to their proper state. The adaptation of a bandage when the patient gets about, is by no means easy. The

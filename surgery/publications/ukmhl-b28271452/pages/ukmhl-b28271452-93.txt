SURGICAL PRACTICE. 39 D 4 elFected by bending the carpus, and applying the power at right angles to the axis of the radius. There is much similitude in the luxations of the wiâ€™ist to those of the phalanges of the fingers and the toes. In falls the flexor tendons of the fingers are in strong action, and give a direction to the force applied to the extremities of the bones. The chief obstacle to reduction is in the lateral ligaments, as these usually remain entire; but, of course, are changed in their direction. Thus, as the muscles then offer next to no resistance, no effort is required to meet their opposition; and as the direction of the lateral ligaments is changed, extension in the axis of the bones is of no use. If the lateral ligaments are entire, the phalanx that is dislocated lies over and parallel to the other, and the lateral ligaments are now at right angles, instead of being in the same line as the bones, and, therefore, by the laws established in the resolution of forces, any power to draw the bone in the line of its axis must only press the bones more closely together. The phalanx must be first drawn at right angles over the upper bone, and then pressed laterally, so that the end may be placed over the fixed bone, and then turned upon this point into its place. This first cross-position must sometimes be made in the direction contrary to that of placing it over the end of the other, and then brought into the straight line. In these joints the muscles will occasionally, when they are moved out of their proper direction, also cause a powerful opposition.

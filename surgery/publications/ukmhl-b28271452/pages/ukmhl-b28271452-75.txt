SURGICAL PRACTICE. 21 c 3 in the following observations. I do not mean by this word that violence by which the bones of a joint are forcibly driven out of their proper posi- tion. This case includes a crushing of the bones, or complication of violent impressions on the part, that clearly endanger the continuance of the struc- ture, as a joint. What I do mean, is that injury which results from some force so applied, as by giving an irregular centre or axis of motion to the bone luxated, to turn it out of the socket; and which usually permits of its being returned, and of its resuming the functions that it previously had of a joint. In this class of cases the muscles have generally the great share in the occurrence of the luxation, and they have a proportionate influence in the processes calculated to efi'ect the reduction. The dislocation of the humerus being one of the most common, the consideration of it otFers the best means of a clear exposition of those conditions under which luxations usually take place. In this joint, which is what is called ball and socket, all the movements of the limb are regulated around a centre, which is nearly the centre of the head of the bone. Whilst the muscles can direct all their actions around this centre, no ordinary force can displace the bone; but if a force changes this or- derly course of action by another power, acting upon the bone under another axis of motion, then the head is thrown out of its socket. The bone is dislocated. In the situation in which a person is when falling, the first impulse involuntarily impels liim to throw out his arm in an extended state to

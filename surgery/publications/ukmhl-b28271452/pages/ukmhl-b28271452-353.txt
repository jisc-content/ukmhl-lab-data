SURGICAL PRACTICE. 299 when the abscess which relieves the joint, forms in the adjoining parts, and includes in its formation some alteration in the state of the shaft of the femur, so that it becomes carious, and terminates in small exfoliations; in which case I have observed that this bone does not develop its growth in equal increments with the other bones, so that the indi- vidual grows up with a shorter thigh-bone on the one side than on the other. The same course of events I liave often seen in the humerus, where there has been scrofulous disease in the bone. It has left the arm shorter on the one side than on the other. In conducting the treatment of this disease of the hip-joint, I have never seen local bleeding do any good, except in the very earliest stage of the com- plaint, and therefore I at once usually establish an issue which never fails to influence beneficially the complaint. The best place for this application is just between the trochanter major and the tuberosity of the ischium, where it is neither exposed to undue pressure nor disturbed by the action of muscles. Of course perfect rest must be enjoined. The disease in the shoulder-joint presents all the features and analogies of that of the hip. It is often allowed to go on some time before the patient is aware of the seizure, inasmuch as it may advance to some extent before the pain calls the attention of the individual to the case. The joint has not the weight of the body to support as in the hip, and the arm has only light movements to undergo by which there is comparatively the sliglitest pressure on the diseased parts ; but, furthermore, the limi-

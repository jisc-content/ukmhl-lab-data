SURGICAL PRACTICE. 54 age as in the fracture of the actual neck, it can in general be adopted. In this injury the fracture unites well as to strength, but usually leaving the limb shortened ; and if treated on the back, without great care, with the foot much turned out. When we look at the strength of the muscular structures that brace up the hip-joint, we are sur- prised that the femur can be so readily dislocated as we know to be the case. The joint is so near the centre of gravity, that every impetus not directed towards this point is expended upon the limb, on which it impinges with very great etfect; so much so as to disjoin the head of the femur from the trunk, inasmuch as it is expended upon the limb before it can be transmitted to the trunk. In the same way, if the person be bearing his whole weight upon his lower extremities, the impetus may im- pinge on the trunk and impel it in the line of its direction before the motion can be transmitted to the limb, and thus cause a displacement of the bone from the joint. In jumping or falling from a height, the whole weight is collected in the centre of gravity of the body; and thus, if the limb that comes to the ground first be placed ob- liquely inwards, the strong adductors being called upon to exert a powerful action, ivill place the head of the femur in a way to be projected obliquely up- wards, over the upper part of the acetabulum, and throw it upon the dorsum of the ilium. If, when a patient is firmly placed upon his lower extremities, which are supporting the whole weight of the trunk, and any force be applied to the upper and

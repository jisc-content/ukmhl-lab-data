This little operation expresses, in fact, the great relief alForded by the division of the integument of carbuncle; but another principle is involved in the efficacy of the treatment of that case. There is yet another state of the periosteum that I think proper to allude to. I have very often had to treat a chronic form of periostitis, which is hardly noticeable in its accession, and slow in its progress. I think the most common seat of this is in the femur just above the condyles, and also above the same processes in the humerus. These affections may be mistaken for disease of the neigh- bouring joints, particularly that of the femur, which is often set down as disease of the knee. I have no reason to suspect them to be of venereal origin ; very often I have been convinced they are not. They affect the patientâ€™s health much beyond the import- ance that might be affixed to the local malady. They rarely fail to yield to the administration of iodine and a moderate quantity of blue pill. The ad- vantage I have observed to be great in the use of the latter medicine; before the adoption of iodine, I have generally seen the cases yield to mercury; I therefore give it a place in this treatment. It is not unusual to have the integuments about the lower end of the fibula diseased, accompanied by an ulcer, and also by a thickening of the periosteum under it. This state is probably the effect of slight injuries having been received on the periosteum, and unnoticed at the time. Tlie sore is apt to be tedious in healing, but the whole disease has appeared to me to be favourably influenced by iodine.

59 SURGICAL PRACTICE. all the muscles act, so there Avill be more strength required in draAving it out, than in the last case. In order to explain some of the conditions of the muscles interested in fractures of bones, I shall observe one circumstance that is really con- firmatory of the position I have taken, that of the complete association by Avhich muscles act in the movements of joints. It is Avhen this consentaneity is broken up in fractures, that the parts of the broken bone are left under the influence of those muscles that have, by their insertion, the greatest lever to act Avith. This is greater, in proportion as the broken portions are more displaced. The fracture of the shaft of the femur olfers ana- logies to that of the humerus. When the fracture occurs just beloAV the trochanter minor, Ave have to contend Avith the functions of tAvo of the most in- fluential muscles of this part of the body, the psoas and iliacus. These are in constant exercise in all the balancing motions, Avhether it be in the erect or sitting posture, and even Avhen lying along; and therefore it is not easy to find such a position as shall alloAv of their being in the greatest repose. My attention has been draAvn to the fact, that in the treatment of fractures of this part of the thigh, the patient being placed on the inclined plane, and the upper portion of the bone huAung risen above the required level, Avhen the loAver portion has been elevated to meet the line of the upper, the latter has started up still higher. I explain this by the fact, that Avhen the limb is bent, it is supported almost entirely by these muscles; and the more there-

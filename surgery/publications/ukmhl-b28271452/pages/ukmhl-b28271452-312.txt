258 SURGICAL PRACTICE. blush which the skin exhibits when deep structures are inflamed. Chronic abscesses, when opened, will often appear to be doing well for the first few days, after which the cyst will become inflamed, and this blush makes its appearance, defining correctly the limits of the abscess. Often in inflammation of the synovial membrane of a joint, the surface over it will give the same expression. In those injuries from violence, in which the deeper parts suffer more than the superficial, the same appearance of blush will nresent itself. X In making mention of chronic abscess, it must be evident that there is a great variety in the con- ditions under which this term may be applied. In this class of complaints we are rarely able to attri- bute any one simply to the result of inflammation of the part in which they occur. They are not those abscesses which Mr. Hunter described as of the part, but rather those he mentions as in the part. They are, I conceive, always depending upon some previous change in a neighbouring structure, and as far as really local treatment can have effect, it must be directed to the primary disease. We usually find some contiguous bone, ligament, or fascia to be the part at fault. These abscesses are of course formed under the fascia, and involve parts of low organisation, and therefore when the inflammation is excited in them, the constitution may be disturbed in a way to endanger life. It is not unusual to find, after opening a chronic abscess, Avhether the aperture be closed or not, that the case appears to be going on for a few

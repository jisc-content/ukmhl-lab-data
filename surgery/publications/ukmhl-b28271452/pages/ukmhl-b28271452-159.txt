105 SURGICAL PRACTICE. tranquillity of the nervous and of the circulating systems. To produce this state, the secretions must be natural : these functions being deranged, the digestive powers are impaired, and nourish- ment does not go on. If the vigor of the con- stitution is so defective as not to be roused to an excited movement, in order to sustain, and then to raise and adjust, its forces for bring- ing out the new functions of reparation, it must sink under the derangement. It is thus that the surgeon has imposed upon him the greatest re- sponsibility in watching his patient for the first three days after serious injuries, where wounds are inflicted. If in twelve hours, or earlier, the pulse does not indicate increased action, if it becomes fluttering and unequal, when the surface does not seem to evolve heat; when the countenance is listless, and perhaps when the patient reports him- self better than it might be expected; and par- ticularly if he is not clear in his answers, but is wavering, then that best of all stimuli, brandy, is to be thrown in, and if there be delirium, opium. The necessity of actual nutriment must not be forgotten. This method must be pursued, and moderated, as the indications point out, until that period arrives, Avhich is the great proof that tranquillity and orderly processes are commencing â€” suppuration. This process is the striking index that the functions are assuming an appropriate arrangement for reparation, and that the system is resuming that tranquillity by which the restoration will be carried on to completion.

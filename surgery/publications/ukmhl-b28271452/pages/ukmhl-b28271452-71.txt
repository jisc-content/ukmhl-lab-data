17 SURGICAL TRACTICE. and keeps in orderly action all the parts of the entire system. As this transitional state is going on, while the whole system apparently remains the same, so must all the parts of the system concur in the influence that is to regulate the whole, and there must be a principle of conservancy pecuhar to every part, as well as to the system at large; a principle not only maintaining the body in its original condition, but giving it the power of rectifying derangements in its state. A local dis- turbance will thus impart a disturbance to the whole. The whole, when perfect, is the orderly proceedings of all the parts; and for this there must be an association in all the parts, to act in unity with the whole. This power of conservancy is equable and un- obtrusive in the influence it exerts, and imper- ceptibly carries on the preservation of our exist- ence. But the operations of external agencies are continually interfering with the orderly proceeding of this power, and invade the integrity of parts, and eventually of the whole system. The dis- turbance which an injury has produced becomes, by the principle of accommodation, an excitement to set up those actions which are required for the repair of the injured part. We call the agent that acts on living struc- tures, so as to induce some change, stimulus; and it implies a quality in them responsive to its influence. The injuries that are produced upon the living structures become often the stimulus for exciting those actions which are calculated to c

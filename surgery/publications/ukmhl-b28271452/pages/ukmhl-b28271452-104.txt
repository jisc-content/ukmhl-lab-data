SUEGICAL PRACTICE. 50 neck is at right angles to the shaft, must then, as in this case, be met by the resistance of a greater part of the bone than when the neck is more oblique. The fact is, that the explanation â– will be found in the want of that preserving power, which arises from the combined and associated action of those muscles that surround the joint. In age an individual be- comes infirm even in those movements which he has all his life been accustomed to, particularly in the power of balancing. He has no longer the freedom of acting with rapidity and with the as- surance of safety, when the aberration of the centre of gravity requires a combination of actions to save him from a fall. But if there is this want of ability to save him- self from falling in the forward movements, how impossible is it for a feeble person to throw out any muscular assistance in case of falling sideways, and he thus comes to the ground upon the trochanter major: as the centre of gravity is in this region, he falls with the force of the whole weight of his body upon this part, and the cervix gives way. I have seen the force expended in crushing the bottom of the acetabulum. The fall is like a dead weight, or as a block of marble, and the pro- jecting trochanter receives the impetus. The prin- ciples of mechanics have solved the problem, which decides that if a system of unequal bodies connected together be projected, so as to come to the ground indifferently as to the manner they may fall, the mo- mentum will be expended on the largest body. The boy who falls frightened from the cherry tree will

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 37 and so united, that the limb has been made almost useless. All that is required are two splints, one on the inner and one on the outer side; but then, the chief thing to be observed, and which is very important, is, that the thumb should be kept quite vertical to the little finger: by this means the two bones are preserved in a parallel position, and the muscles in the interosseous space, both before and behind, have the best position for repose, and for the avoidance of pressure. There is one sort of fracture of the radius that requires particular notice. In falls the hand is jmt out naturally to receive the shock: as this is done in relation to its position with the body, so the injury may be transmitted either to the shoulder, or to other parts. But it often happens that the impetus is impressed on the ball of the thumb or extremity of the radius: this pro- duces a fracture of the lower end of the radius in an oblique direction, commencing just about the styloid process, and extending inwards to the joint. This is a very painful injury, and not rea- dily to be detected by any thing like a crepitus. In general, the hand drops downward, in respect of the natural state of the fore-arm. This frac- ture unites as readily as others, but it leaves great want of power to use the hand, and very often much pain. Now I attribute these untoward states to the mischief so commonly produced where ban- daging is adopted. If pressure be made use of, it is on that part of the radius where both the flexor and extensor tendons pass in grooves, in the lower end

SUKGICAL PRACTICE. 228 I had in the hospital a young man Avith a scrotum, so much enlarged, that it extended half Avay down his thigh. On the left side there Avas a very large varicocele, the veins being much enlarged, and tlieir valves thickened. I kept the patient in bed for about three or four Aveeks, and the veins resumed their usual state of health ; there was not the least indication of varicocele now remaining. He left the hospital apparently Avell, but before long he returned Avith a relapse of the disease. I then removed a portion of the scrotum, Avhich Avas folloAved by considerable inflammation and great disturbance of the constitution. He ultimately left the hospital Avell; but I had no opportunity of seeing him after- Avards, and therefore of knoAving Avhether the vari- cocele Avas permanently cured, T have not seen the A'aricose sore often in those cases where the patient has a delicate integument, and the parietes of the veins are apparently so much extenuated that they become largely dilated Avhen the subject is erect, and immediately subside Avhen the recumbent position is resumed. This is a state of varix in Avhich the vein is apt to give Avay, and subject the patient to very serious hemorrliage; and in this case, it often leaves a superficial sore, of the varicose character. When the diseased vein lies in a bed of indurated cel- lular tissue, Avhich sometimes occui-s, I have seen, if tlie vein gets slightly inflamed, small collections of matter form in this thickened structure. T have no doubt, that if patients Avould submit to the confinement, that by means of continued rest

99 SURGICAL TRACTICE. light. If health mean the mere muscular power in the usual exercises of the body when free to move, then some countenance may be allowed to this opinion. Certainly the muscular subject cannot vault into his saddle, or throw the quoit, after being kept to his bed, as otherwise he would have been able to do. But if health mean the orderly exercise and equable succession of those functions of which life is made up, then I have reason for thinking that with some precautions health is very well maintained in bed. I have often known jiatients to have been in bed not only months, but even years, and I have observed that all those processes which present themselves as marks of health are present. I have seen patients, after having been in bed some time, enjoy their food with an appetite to which they had been un- accustomed, sleep unaided by sedatives in a more than usually composed manner, the natural relief of the bowels being regular, and the skin performing its functions uninterruptedly. In short, these patients have been in the very best state for the agencies to repair imperceptibly the disturbances from injuries, and other causes. Without the re- pose of bed, the surgeon often would idle aAvay his time, waste his resources, and inflict suffering upon his patient in the greater number of his cases. The prejudice against this treatment has arisen from the fact, that patients are generally sent to bed with a wasting disease upon them; and when the period of convalescence approaches, they attribute to bed that weakness and debility which is the con- sequence of the complaint for which tliey were con- signed to it. n

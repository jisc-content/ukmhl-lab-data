There is an endowed power that always assists Avith its etficacy the tendency to natural arrangement; and this influence being maintained by continual readjustment, distortion is preA^ented. The sim- j)lest apparatus is necessary; and all coercion of the muscles is to be shunned. It is this case, both in reference to the ditficulties I have had to contend Avith, and the facilities atforded by adopting the correct vieAv under which muscles act, Avhich has convinced me that there is a doc- trine applicable to muscular action that has not hitherto been alluded to.

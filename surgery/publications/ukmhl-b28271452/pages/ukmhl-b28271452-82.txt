SURGICAL PRACTICE. 28 The bone is easily replaced, and as easily put out again, so that a long observance of immobility must be insisted upon after the reduction, before the limb will become quite restored. Of course there is a limitation to the period of the propriety of trying reduction in old cases, as the power of ac- commodation is so unfailing, that changes too great may occur, after much time, to justify the interfer- ing with this settled order of things. I consider that it is highly proper for the secu- rity of the joint, that the limb, after a luxation, should be kept at rest some weeks. A brewer’s man was brought to St. Bartholomew’s Hosj)ital, with a luxation at one hip, and at one shoulder. He was kept in bed a month after the reduction, but allowed to move his arm. When he left, he felt nothing of the hip, but he suffered pain in his shoulder. A female, of the order of tish-women, was brought to the hospital with dislocation of the shoulder; the bone was reduced ; and she chose to go out, and immediately resume her occuj)ation of carrying a basket on her head. The dislocation very soon recurred, and again and again she applied at the hospital for the same purpose, it slipped out so readily. But as the old method of mere traction was employed it became more difficult to effect the reduction, so much so that at last she had to stay in the hospital some days before it could be accom- plished. In forming a diagnosis of luxation at the shoulder, the increase of length between the acro- mion and the external condyle of the humerus

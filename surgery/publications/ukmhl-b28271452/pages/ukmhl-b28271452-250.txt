As the integuments are disposed to heal long before the urethra is closed, there is much atten- tion and ingenuity required in carrying on the treatment, for the urine is, by the narrowing of the external artificial opening, pressed into the ad- joining parts, where it burrows. The bougie is now required to improve the stricture, and so to diminish the quantity that may be forced out of the tube, and thus to avoid those fluctuations which attach themselves to this case. The keeping instruments in the bladder is more injurious here than in the other descriptions of cases. As there is a state of things that offers less power for con- tending with those obstacles that are calculated to impede the restoration of functions in the urethra. Of course the elements to form a prognosis are to be found in the age and debility of constitution of the patient. These cases will often do well. There is by no means an unusual accident, occurring from the patient having fallen on a hard substance ina stradling position, by which he receives a hard bloAV between his legs, so that the urethra is crushed between the hard body and the pubis; this often happens to boys walking on a rail, by which the urethra is ruptured.

213 SURGICAL PRACTICE. the ankle joint or of the tendons of the peronei muscles, the brevis usually. In the case of the ligaments being injured there is usually no elfusion of blood, and a considerable time is required for getting rid of the pain on moving, particularly if the parts are put on the stretch by using the limb too early : but when a tendon is sprained, there is generally a little blood thrown out into its sheath, and the pain may perhaps be greater than that of the ligaments at first, but by rest it is sooner re- moved. In this sort of cases, however slight, it is of the utmost importance that the injured parts should be kept in perfect quietude for the first few days, without which they will often linger and cause a lameness for months. Those bruises which occur to the parts of ten- dons or ligaments just at their insertion into bones produce long and considerable pain, and are of such a character as may lead to the suspicion that a very serious injury has been produced to the bone or to a neighbouring joint. The insertion of the deltoid muscle into the acromion, and of the ligament of the patella into this bone, when patients in falling strike these parts, ofier the most common cases of this description. These injuries cause the greatest pain and difficulty when the muscles are put in action, and the parts are often very long before they recover. Many cases occur of contusion of the knee joint without fracture or other injury, in which the synovial membrane becomes suddenly distended with etfusecl blood. This distension of course is the

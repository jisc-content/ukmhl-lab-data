SURGICAL PRACTICE. 33 the limb dragging on the broken part, and to keep the radius parallel, and above the ulna; of course, a sling is proper. I regard one caution very neces- sary in this case, and that is, not to allow any motion in the joint until the bones are perfectly united. I consider what is called passive motion, worse than useless. If motion is adopted too early, it excites a process to be set up of thickening about the joint, which increases the limitation of motion. The arm should be kept quiet, until it can be moved without the least uneasiness. The cases of luxation of the elbow-joint are, for the most part, those where both bones are thrown either backwards, internally, or externally. But in these three luxations of the elbow, the joint being hinge-like, and the mode of action being on an axis, this derangement produced by the luxation hardly amounts to a disturbance of the associated action of the muscles about the axis. If the luxation is outwards or inwards, they still are left to act upon the same axis, only a little more laterally than before: if backwards, still the axis is only a little more forwards than usual; thus the muscles offer only a very slight hinderance to reduction. The principles before insisted upon, are borne out practically by the manipulation required for reduction. The limb usually presents itself with the fore-arm semiflexed upon the upper arm. The principal point is to fix firmly the upper arm, and the operator has only to draw gently the fore- arm forwards, and bend it, at the same time pressing laterally on the parts dislocated, and the bones will D

SUEGICAL PKACTICE. 243 in the horizontal position, the arteries are best dis- posed to return to regulated action. The cessation of pain, and the appearance of moderate suppu- ration, are the signs of a disposition to do well. So far from the accession of gangrene necessarily leading to sphacelus, many cases get well, parti- cularly on the first attack, and the patients will often live some years afterwards. It is right to bear in mind, that as a very slight cause can set up this state of gangrene, although the parts are entire, so when the sore that may supersede the gangrene is doing well, a stimulus of undue strength applied to the part may, by calling upon the powers beyond their vigour, throw the sore into a renewed state of gangrene: which fact I have seen happen. As in chilblains, so in this complaint, opium has a happy effect as a local remedy to the part. I had in the hospital a young woman, in whom the artery of the upper extremity became obli- terated, and gangrene took place at the extre- mities of the fingers. It was not at all apparent how the artery had become thus impervious. The heart was weak in its action, although the patient was only nineteen years old. No pulsation could be felt in any artery of the left upper extremity, up to the scaleni muscles, and yet no parts were mortified higher than the fingers and thumb; which fact probably shows that the anastomosing system was equal to the support of the whole of the limb, with the exception of these extreme parts. I have already alluded to traumatic gangrene as

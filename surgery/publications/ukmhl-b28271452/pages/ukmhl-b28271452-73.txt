19 SURGICAL PRACTICE, c 2 structure of parts which is necessary for the exer- cise of functions. We see such exquisite adaptation in the lachrymal appendages, that the exercise of their functions is carried on without exciting the least sensation. If a particle of dust be blown upon the eye, which particle is of form and size to give the sensation of its presence under the lid, and the eyelids be not rubbed, then, although it may give pain, this soon goes off, and the patient is no longer aware of its presence. The particle has lodged under the tarsal edge, and becoming quickly enveloped with the se- cretion of the glands there, is no longer an irritant, nor does it excite any feeling. It is, indeed, in the condition of the natural secretions of the part, and, therefore, it may be present without impressing the sensations. But, nevertheless, it is a stimulus, although insensibly so to the part, to excite that process which quietly removes the particle from under the lid, and completely ejects it. But in the same case, if the eye be rubbed, then the particle, instead of remaining at the edge of the lid and getting a coat of mucus quickly, so as to be quietly removed, is, by the act of rubbing, which excites the orbicularis to retain it, carried further under the lid, where it not only excites a painful sensation, but keeps up the irritation it produces, a considerable time; indeed, until it is clothed with mucus, which is now a longer process to go through than in the other case. But here again, when the particle is so coated all pain ceases, and it remains unfelt till it is expelled. These cases are both

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 182 ready to believe that there are no strictures of that kind, which have their origin in mere irri- tation, that are not perfectly curable by this line of treatment. Another order of stricture is that in which the urethra is beset with hard projecting bodies through- out its spongy portion, arising from an altered state of the lacunas, which are changed into an almost cartilaginous structure. These are numerous; and as each fills nearly the calibre of the tube, they oifer a great obstacle to the introduction of an in- strument ; and this they do in a way that should be borne in mind. The space in the first stricture, through which it may be possible to pass an instru- ment, does not necessarily correspond in direction Avith the opening of the second, consequently the instrument by passing through one is not led to the opening of the second, but is then carried against the projecting part, wdiich offers a direct obstacle. Thus a firm instrument is less likely to arrive at the successive openings owing to the de- viations which the first bodies cause; and a soft instrument has hardly power enough to encounter the resistance of these indurated projections. But even here the catgut and perseverance Avill restore the parts. As the excitability of the prostatic portion is but little in this sort of urethra, the prin- ciple of dilation may have a place in the treatment. I have regarded this state to have been the conse- quence of the free use of injections. There is another variety of disease of the urethra, which conveys to the feeling when an instrument is passed of a small spongy substance, Avhich bleeds

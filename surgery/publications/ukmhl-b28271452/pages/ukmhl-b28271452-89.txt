35 SURGICAL PRACTICE. D 2 obvious metliod seems to be to apply pressure on the head of the bone in the proper direction, whilst the joint is kept under the three ordinary w^ays of move- ment, for which its structure is adapted. Although I am not aware of having ever had to treat a case of recent luxation of the head of the radius back- wards, yet I have occasionally had old cases of this sort at the hospital. I suspect that the nature of the injury is overlooked at the time of occurrence. The bone is thrown behind, and rather beneath the external condyle, not entirely, but suthciently so for the surgeon to feel its arti- culating end, and to be able to rotate the arm upon it. The limitations of extension, flexion, and ro- tation are not great, and become by time ranch less, so that the arm is ultimately not very defec- tive. It behoves the surgeon to be most scrutin- ising in examining injuries of the elbow-joint, lest this derangement should escape detection. I con- ceive the method of reduction to be the same as alluded to in the last luxation spoken of. There are two cases of what are called fracture of the olecranon. The one, where the fracture takes place about the middle of the semilunar notch: usually this offers a complete separation of tlie part, to be clearly felt. I always treat this case by perfect extension, which places the olecranon completely in its fossa. In this position the broken parts of the bone are made to press closely and strongly on each other, and to assume the most perfect adaptation; at the same time, as the arm is in one of its natural states, there does

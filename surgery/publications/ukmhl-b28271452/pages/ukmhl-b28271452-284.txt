I have already alluded to the circumstance of the fre- quent anastomose of large veins with each other, a fact quite enough to prove that their functions, to be rightly exercised, require the greatest freedom of space; and therefore, in estimating that power for repairing disease which the conservancy of function exercises over structures, this provision for preserving the channels free and numerous, must form an essential element in the treatment of the disease of veins. I have insisted much on the beneficial effects of of long-continued recumbency of the limb in cases of varix, which is indeed very frequently an incipient form of phlebitis. This latter complaint affords the opportunity of seeing the value of recumbency and rest, and that they are of the utmost importance. The most common cases that occur, are those that arise after the operation of phlebotomy, which, with the observance of keeping the limb perfectly at rest in bed, and the application of leeches, usually termi- nate well; but if the arm is allowed to dangle in a sling, this slight affection may be roused to display symptoms of the most fearful character. I think the slightest injury of this sort should induce the surgeon to enjoin the strongest commands that the patient should keep his bed.

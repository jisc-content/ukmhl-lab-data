If the wound and the contusion be deeper and greater than that above described, the structures underneath suffer, as the tendinous ex- pansion of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and then suppuration will almost always follow to some ex- tent under this aponeurosis. As the collections are formed under the fibrous structure of the aponeurosis, they of course should be very early opened. It is owing to this form- ation of pus that erysipelas does not so generally supervene in these scalp wounds as might be ex- pected to take place. The structures of relatively inferior organisation will suffer in their vitality, so that we often have sloughs to some extent. I have seen many cases where the scalp for a great part of the skull has been stripped off, particularly in young children, which have notwithstanding very often done extremely well. I have seen a large portion of the scalp in a child, nearly that of one side of the head, turned back, and yet the whole adhered to the pericranium, and healed, with the slightest exception, by adhesive union. In these cases the scalp is, as it were, torn off, and the deli- cate tissue between the fibrous structure and the pericranium readily alloivs its reflection. This sort of wound is really a rent, as a piece of paper may be torn, the edges being in the slightest way con- tused. This ready union, besides the very great advan- X 3

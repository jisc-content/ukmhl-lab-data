SURGICAL PRACTICE. 82 who was able to throw himself into a variety of attitudes and actions, while the limb lay as quiet as if it had been glued to the bed. As far as mus- cular action was concerned, the limb was dissociated from the rest of the body, participating in none of the movements that were taking place. But when the time came that the patient was to get about, he had to educate all the muscles of the limb in their natural associations, and also to implant the necessary vigour into them for the purposes of restoring motion. Thus Aveeks, and even months, were uselessly wasted before perfect recovery. I was thus convinced that one chief point in the treatment of fractures, more particularly of the lower limb, is to release the muscles from restraint the moment the broken bones are ascertained to be tolerably firm. It occasionally happens that on leaving off the apparatus, although the bones seem to be united, yet pain comes on in the fractured part: this points out the propriety of re-applying the apparatus. In general a week longer is all that is required. I have invariably observed that Avhen a bone is broken, and the limb is left subjected to all the little changes of motion, by the omission of the apparatus the first day, about the third the pain becomes \"ery considerable, and is immediately relieved by the adaptation of means for preventing motion betAveen the broken parts. The mechanism should be of the simplest kind, and interfere as little as possible Avith the muscles. The splints should be adapted for the bearing upon the extremities of the bones, and they should

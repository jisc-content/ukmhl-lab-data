SUHGICAL PEACTICE. 316 the degrees of the injury. The points I have al- ready alluded to, of the variety of ways in which the impetus of a blow may be communicated to the head, is continually exemplified in these cases. We find that most of these cases present no external mark of the blow, even when severe symptoms are present. Very many of them are so slight as not to require bleeding at any time. The complete evacu- ation of the bowels, and the daily action of them, with low diet, often include all the necessary treat- ment, not omitting the especial benefit of mercury when there are any lingering pains. This remedy alone removes the wearing pains and giddiness that will often continue, in spite of bleeding either locally or generally. I think opium should be avoided, and it is quite as well that the mercury, whatever the preparation may be, should act on the bowels, as it then also fulfils the purpose of deriva- tion from the head. It is of the utmost importance that cases of concussion, however slight, should be watched at least ten days or a fortnight; and that the bowels and diet should be rightly managed for a longer time.

The simplest case may be that, in which a boy gets a slight fall, and, after a momentâ€™s hesitation, shakes olf the effects, and re- turns to his amusements; and the extreme case on the opposite side is, when the impression on the elas- tic cranium is such that the effect of the blow on it is to alter the figure so mucli as to lacerate the

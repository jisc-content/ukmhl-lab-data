SURGICAL PRACTICE. 208 now, and there were at one time many more cases that required an operation for relief. The practice then pursued was to puncture the bladder above the pubis, if the catheter could not be passed. It appeared to be a very successful practice; and I have done it often, and very rarely lost a patient by it. Where the patient Avas not very old, and tolerably healthy, it has never failed of restoring him to ]iealth. I have never seen any infiltration of urine folloAV this operation that was of consequence enough to retard the cure; and the wound has readily healed, because the urine soon found a passage through the urethra. The advantage of this step has been that as the urethra is not for a time called upon to sustain the force of the propelled fluid, and has been kept in a state of quietude, it readily has returned to a state fit for carrying on its function. It is left to the power of conservancy Avhen it has been freed from the irri- tation of the undue mechanical forces of straining, Avhich have been the cause of the daily increase in the obstruction. And this is in my view a very poAverful reason for adopting this operation over that one of opening into the urethra at the mem- branous portion. The latter operation presents itself Avith more imposing anatomical circumstances; but it has been folloAved under my observation Avith very inferior success. I have seen several patients die after this has been performed from the effusion of the urine Avithin the pelvis. This last operation is more difficult than by the description it is made to appear, and therefore it is long and exhausting to the patient; Avhereas the opening above the

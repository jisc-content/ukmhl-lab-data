SURGICAL PRACTICE. 256 the greatest care is required in the management of the diet, and too much attention cannot be paid to secure a regular state of the bowels; if any accu- mulation is allowed to take place in the lower ones, this will readily cause some signs of the revival of the disease. Erysipelas leaves the patient exceedingly weak, and restoration to the usual state of health is often very slow. The frequent revival of mild attacks seems to depress the powers of the constitution even more than one of a severer kind. It will happen, that if erysipelas attacks a person who has besides some previous organic disease, it will often continue, not- withstanding the best treatment, shifting its seat, and assuming changes in appearance. If the pink or orange tint gives way to the bluish or brown appearance, then the prompt administration of stimuli is strongly indicated. The pulse will then give full indication of the sinking powers of the constitution. I consider that in all those slight hurts that so often lead to phlegmonous erysipelas, it is of the ut- most importance that the most perfect repose should be given to the part, and even the slightest cases of the sort occurring in the hand require that the patient should be kept in bed; by doing which he will preserve his hand unimpaired, when otherwise, if the limb is not so secured from motion, the fingers or the whole part may be lost to him. In this form of the disease it is often necessary to make incisions, both to diminish tension when great, and more particularly to let out matter.

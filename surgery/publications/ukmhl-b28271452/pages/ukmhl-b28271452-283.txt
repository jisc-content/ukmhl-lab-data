229 SURGICAL PRACTICE. and leecMiig, Avhen this step is required, all cases of varix may be fully relieved. I have not seen much benefit accrue from pressure or bandaging. But there is an application that I have found of the greatest benefit, particularly in varicocele, which is, the daily use of a hard flesh-brush. The etfect of this friction seems to be very marked in diminish- ing the enlargement of the veins, and also in giving tone and elasticity to the scrotum. 1 think it has an influence on the veins especially, as I have seen it answer so well in varix of the leg. Of course the condition of the integument must be such as to allow the employment of rather a harsh remedy. I have always been at a loss to understand the reasoning which has led to the adoption of the practice of obliterating a vein in a varicose limb. Yarix is not a mere disease of a part of a vein, which the tying ^of the tube, or the removal of the part, can get rid of. It is the derangement of a sys- tem of tubes designed for conveying the blood to the centre of circulation; and one condition for properly carrying this on is, that the space in which the fluid is to move should be duly capacious. The breaking up of one channel must throw more fluid into those that are left open ; and as the relief of all tubes under disease is just in proportion to the undisturbed course which the contents of the tube are allowed to take, so I apprehend this practice is really calculated to keep up the varicose state of the limb. I have seen cases where varicose veins of the leg have been tied, or divided, and where portions

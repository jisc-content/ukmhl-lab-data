SURGICAL PRACTICE. 9G lieacl. The body was coated with cerumen, and of course interstitial absorption had been going on under the influence of the power of relief set- ting it free. The analogy of the terms of the proposition I have laid down is seen in the usual treatment of a common ulcer in a healthy state. The surgeon wipes away the pus from the part, and places upon the sore a piece of dry lint. This gives uneasiness for a short time; it then becomes lined with healthy pus, and its presence is no longer felt; it acts only now as a layer of pus, the usual covering of the sore: but it has called forth an excited action to increase the energy of the process of reparation; for the stimulus has only amounted to that of relief. Thus the slight action of this piece of lint is an agent for promoting the healing process. If the pus were not wiped off from the sore, the application of lint would hardly amount to the stimulus for relief, which sets up the best means for carrying on the steps necessary for healing healthy ulcers. In the case of fistula in ano, after the operation the surgeon inserts a piece of lint to prevent the parts divided from healing by adhesion, as the edges of the cut are compressed together. This is quite right. He goes on inserting the lint, which produces a very slight irritation, and he soon finds that the lint does not remain in the gap, but comes out and lies upon the external parts. He may doubt whether, as the lint does not remain, it really does any good. But he should regard this as a proof that there is a powerful exertion for healing

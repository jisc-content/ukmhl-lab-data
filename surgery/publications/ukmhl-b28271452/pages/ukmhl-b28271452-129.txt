75 SURGICAL PRACTICE. its axis. Thus the moment the leg was bent, the extensors returned into a comparative state of repose, and left the patella quietly to resume its appointed position. Not very long after the oc- currence of the above case, I was called one night to the hospital to a similar one. The house surgeon had adopted all the means of ingenuity and of force, but had not succeeded in reducing it. I bent the leg, and rotating it in the axis of the tibia, the patella quietly returned, and thus was accomplished the reduction. In the category of luxations about this part, I must place that of the semilunar cartilages. I have had several of these cases under my manage- ment. I think I may say that they have always been, as might be expected, of the internal one. The case is marked by the joint becoming, on some quick motion of the trunk about the axis on one leg, locked. Often there is great pain, and a slight projection of the anterior edge of the cartilage beyond the margin of the head of the tibia. It is a fact, that the pain is sometimes excruciating, and â€¢will continue, yet the moment the cartilage is reduced, no pain or even tenderness will remain. I have seen much force, and varieties of positions given to the knee by powerful means; but all, on principle, must be worse than useless. I have only seen one case in my practice ever reduced thing like force, and that was in a man who had frequently suffered the same, when by carrying the leg as far back as could be clone, the cartilage slipped into its place.

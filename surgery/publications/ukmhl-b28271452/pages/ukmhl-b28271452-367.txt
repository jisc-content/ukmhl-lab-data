313 SURGICAL PRACTICE. do well wlieii there was bleeding from, the ears and mouth, and other severe symptoms. A gentleman who was travelling on the back seat of a stage coach stood up whilst the vehicle stopped for an instant; the coach started on fast without his being aware of it, by which he was projected head- foremost over the back of the seat, and making a somerset, fell on the vertex of the head: he was stunned, and had bleeding from the nose and ear. He had to endure a long period of pain and extreme sensibility to the impression of light, as it was only slowly that he became better; he ultimately sot well, but was left with both the sense of taste and smell very much impaired; which, however, after several years, he recovered. Fractures at the base seem to begin with symp- toms very much like those of bad cases of con- cussion. But when these first symptoms begin to moderate in a few days, if fracture has been pro- duced, the patient, then, instead of getting tranquil, has the pulse becoming small, unequal, and frequent; and he becomes delirious, having very generally twitches of the face and limbs ; indicating another order of things different from mere concussion. I have no reason to infer, from what I have seen, that a case of fracture of the skull is ever made worse by dividing the scalp over it, where there is not already a wound. I suspect the long-en- during pains that continue after blows, are often cases of that kind of diseased periosteum which I have before spoken of, as cases which are cured by an incision.

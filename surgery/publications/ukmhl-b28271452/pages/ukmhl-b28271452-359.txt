But, on the other hand, surgeons know, owing to the greater organization of the face, that, in the operation for hare-lip, if the edges are found not to be united on removing the ligatures, yet, the child being healthy, in a little time the part Avill begin to heal from the nose downwards, and finally close the wound ; the case thus proving to be finally a successful one.

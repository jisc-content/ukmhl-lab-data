324 SURGICAL PRACTICE. operation should be performed early. The surgeon begins the operation with the uncertainty of what the state of things may turn out to be, and what steps he may be called on to pursue, in order to complete it properly. The condition of the operation seems to be only perfectly answered when the bowel is so completely returned, that it is freely floating in the abdomen. On this account I have always regarded a mass of omentum in the sac as a circumstance of consider- able apprehension. As this state of omentum only occurs in old hernia, where the part has been long protruded, the part within the cavity has be- come elongated, and does not drag much on the stomach. If it be cut off, and the vessels tied, and then replaced in the abdomen, I have not only seen ha3morrhage take place into the cavity, but I have seen peritonitis apparently set up by the irritation of the ligatures, or else beginning from the cut edges, and spread from thence. Moreover, it has happened, that the divided edges have adhered to the parts in their neighbourhood, and in this way there has been formed, as it were, a belt pressing on the convolutions of intestine under it; so that, if the part that has been protruded should happen to lie under this belt, this pressure, although it may be slight, will entirely prevent the bowel recover- ing its function; in short, in this way the symp- toms of strangulation will be kept up. I am in- clined to think the best way is to leave the omentum in the sac; for if the patient should get over the immediate consequences of the operation, it will

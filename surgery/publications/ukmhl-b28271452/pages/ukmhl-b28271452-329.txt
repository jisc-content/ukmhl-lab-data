275 SURGICAL PRACTICE. T 2 of health, and that it has a singular efficacy when employed in scrofula. The scrofulous affection which indicates most decidedly the limitations under which the manifes- tations of the complaint exist, is the enlargement of the tonsils. These cases are more common in the female than in the other sex, and are rarely found after thirty years of age of any troublesome size, however large and embarrassing they may have been at more early periods, particularly in that of childhood. I have seen very many exceedingly enlarged tonsils producing the greatest annoyance in patients at fifteen or twenty years of age, which have gradually shrunk or assumed the natural size by the time that the subject had arrived at the age of thirty. If we consider the great utility of these glands in secreting a mucus of a peculiarly lubri- cating kind, so valuable in the economy of degluti- tion, I cannot regard it as good practice to remove these parts so unsparingly as I have known to be often done.

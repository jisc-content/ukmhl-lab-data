SURGICAL RRACTICE. 116 of the degree of viol&nce that has been done; but also that in these injuries we may not find all the relief we hoped for after the lapse of the first few days, at which period, in cases of severe wounds of soft parts only, the patient is often placed in comparative safety. These are cases of the most anxious kind, and which call for the exercise of the best judgment. There is in the occurrence of severe injuries a state of things actually very different, yet perhaps apparently not so, to the kind of cases above de- scribed. It is that of injuries where the integuments are not wounded from without, but are really lace- rated or torn from within outwards. Thus, suppose a blunt portion of bone, either by means of frac- ture or of rupture of ligaments, is so far displaced that it is pushed from within outwards, and that, by first stretching the integuments as far as their elasticity will allow, it then makes a rent; I say that this wound made by overcoming the elasticity of this structure, is perhaps even more disposed to heal than the cleanest incised wound. The fact has been virtually acknowledged in the case of the compound dislocation of the foot outwards at the ankle joint. It has been remarked, that these cases do well beyond the expectation of the surgeon, bearing in mind the struggles he often has to con- tend -with in other wounds, and in mischiefs of deep parts. This kind of wound is effected at the ankle joint when the deltoid ligament has given way by the internal malleolus first stretching, and then bursting through, the integument; which, in

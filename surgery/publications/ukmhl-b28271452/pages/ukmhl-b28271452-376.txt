SUKGICAL PRACTICE. 322 less pain, by which the abdominal muscles are not excited to act against the efforts which are neces- sary for pressing the parts inwards. There is, in short, so much less resistance in the muscles on applying the manipulation, that there is by far a greater prospect of succeeding than without the bath. The form in which the body is to be placed to facilitate the taxis, is of much importance. I had a youth with a strangulated inguinal hernia; after trying the taxis, and jierhaps some other measures which failed, I resolved to operate. In order to be conveyed to the theatre the beadle carried him in his arins, his head and shoulders resting on one arm, and his hams on the other, so that his body was bent forwards considerably. I was close to him when he was placed in this position, and saw the hernia suddenly slip up. This posture pro- bably offers two advantages; it throws the root of the mesentery farther from the opening, and so allows this structure to draw the bowel inwards; it also brings the passage through which the parts come, whether femoral or inguinal, in a line more directly leading to the cavity. These passages, owing to the oblique position of the pelvis, being at an oblique angle with the axis of the abdomen, are less free and smaller in the straight position of the body than when bent, as they then are made to open directly inwards. Many cases of strangulated hernia may be got up in the bath, which could not be reduced other- wise without operation; and in any circumstance the incurvated form of the back will facilitate the return of the protrusion.

SURGICAL PRACTICE. 255 dicines as are adapted to promote all tlie secretions. The impaired state of the stomach restricts the administration of nutriment to diet of the mildest quality, and the character of the pulse will not allow the excitement of the usual stimuli. I have invariably observed, that the quickness of the pulse bears a close relation with the state of erysipelas on the skin; and that when the complaint has appeared to be fading off, and the pulse getting slow, on the administration of wine, and more particularly of ammonia, the erysipelas has sprung up with renewed vigour. As the general treat- ment, in my opinion, consists in tranquillising the increased, although feeble, action of the circulation, and in restoring the impaired functions of secretion, so also the local treatment should be that which can best soothe the parts, and restore the healthy secretions of the surface; for which warmth and moisture seem by far the best adapted. The essential nature of the complaint seems to be a state opposed to the exercise of the suppurative pro- cess, and when sores affected with erysipelas show any indication of producing pus, the inflammation of the part then ceases. If the attack has been on the face, one of the presages of a happy termination will be the formation of a small abscess in the fine tissue of the eyelids ; this quickly forms, and should be speedily let out by a small puncture. As soon as this pus is formed the redness of the face begins to fade away, the pulse and tongue improve, the skin becomes moist, and the stomach is not so intolerant of food.

246 SURGICAL PRACTICE. the mildest cases are of a fearful character. From the way in which, with this injury, the patients swallow- I have conceived that the oesophagus is not usually much affected. By the application of a leech or two, according to the age, and the ad- ministration of calomel and antimony, in most of the cases the symptoms have subsided in twenty- four hours; often the breathing has become free immediately after the application of the leeches. It may not be altogether impossible to form a tolerable scale for measuring the destructive power of hea.t at various temperatures, but there are many circumstances to be nicely estimated before we can arrive at a satisfactory result. With respect to scalds, we do not, in the first place, know the degree of heat of the fluid. If it be applied through the clothes, we do not know the reduction of temper- ature that the transmission through them produces. The duration of the presence of the heated body upon the part is also an element in the calculation. The quality of the fluid in scalds is a most material point to be kept in view. However, in any circum- stances, we have a most material condition that in- fluences widely the character of this injury; it is the vigour or weakness of the individual scalded or burnt. We may assume, that under all circum- stances, there is a more limited range in the in- tensity of the heat applied in the former than in burns. It cannot in mere water exceed the boiling point, and may be several degrees below it: thus, in the ordinary run of cases, where the health of the subject is tolerably good, and the heated fluid

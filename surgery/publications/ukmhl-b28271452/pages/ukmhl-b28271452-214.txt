SURGICAL PRACTICE. 160 course of these abscesses, when opened, is to close and finally heal; but the surgeon must not expect that they will heal with the readiness of ordinary active abscesses. He must recollect that they are seated in a structure particularly indolent, and little assailable by ordinary stimuli; and these, when used, must be applied to the bottom of the cavity. The stimulus of the division of the cutis does not extend to the deep parts, so that the external portion of the wound is inclined to heal long before the deeper structure is disposed to commence this function. This abscess, if left alone, does not exclusively lead either to the surface or to the rectum, but advances simultaneously in both directions. When the fistula is complete, the sinus, being relieved from all irritation, makes no exer- tion to set up a process for repairing the imper- fection. Where'there is an indispostion in parts to respond to stimuli, there is equally a power of endurance in submitting to the derangement ; thus, when the abscess has opened in the one or the other direction, but more particularly in both, there being a free exit of all secretion formed, there remains no re-acting power to throw forth any curative function for fully restoring the natural condition of the parts. Thus the fistulse remain for a long while inert and uninfluenced by all the usual stimulating applications, and the pro- cesses for restoration seem to have terminated by accommodating the parts to their unnatural con- dition, so that the sinus is converted into a hard

Stimulus is so much an element in surgical pathology, that every investigation that can settle any of its laws, must be exceedingly desirable. The simplest action that a stimulus may excite on a part is that of producing a process for immediate relief. This of course implies a con- formity in the part acted upon to receive an im- pression that will not go further than to effect this relief. But even a stimulus that would induce only processes for relief, may require more elaborate actions for this purpose, owing to the want of this conformity; and further, the stimulus may cause destruction, without exciting any series of actions for repairing the mischief. The influence of conservancy seems to be a power always acting upon structures to preserve their functions; and the importance of functions gives the degree of energy in the reparation of structures. Surgeons have puzzled their brains as to the best means of keeping the parts of a wound of the tongue together, whether by stitches, &c. The fact is,'all meddling does harm. If the pa- tient will keep the tongue quiet at the bottom of his mouth, the wound will heal, as I have seen, better than any thing his busy hand can do to effect it.

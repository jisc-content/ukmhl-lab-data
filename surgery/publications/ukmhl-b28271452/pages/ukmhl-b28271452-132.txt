78 SURGICAL PRACTICE. say that fractures, and particularly of the leg, should not have any more apparatus applied than just enough to guard the limb from those dis- turbances that may by chance be made. The em- ployment of bandages is not only useless but in- jurious ; in the first place, they produce an unne- cessary derangement of parts in their application and daily adjustment, interfering much in the pro- cesses going on to efiect the union of the bone; they also have the effect, every day they are continued, of lessening the tone and power of the muscles. The object should be to have the muscles as little deteriorated in power and freedom of action as possible, so that when the bones are firm, the patient may have these organs in the very best state of usefulness; by which the patient saves not only weeks, but months, in acquiring the full use of his limb. I have very often discharged men with broken legs, both bones being broken, at the end of a month, who could walk very fairly, and in less than six weeks were capable of any labour. I allow most of my cases to get a little about in three weeks. It occasionally will happen that the bones are tardy in uniting; sometimes the fibula will be the first to unite ; and the tibia is left un- united, but more commonly the tibia is united first and the fibula left un-united. If this state of want of firmness, or un-united condition, continues beyond the full time of usual recovery, I allow the patient to get up and try the powers of the limb. Mr. Hunter recommended this course, and accounted for the success that generally follows, by saying that it

SURGICAL rilACTlCE, power to bring' down the bone, but from the failure of those means by which the limb is ultimately to be reduced, the process of extension being only a previous stej). The ordinary manipulation of the surgeon goes no further than that of bringing the displaced bone into a position in which the muscles around the joint may resume their associated actions, and then they start, with velo- city and power, the bone into its socket. This power which they exert is thus employed, as in the shoulder joint, considerably in opposition to the line of traction, and proves to be a force greater than that used in the extension. It is properly directed to conduct the traction slowly and steadily, not by jerks; this is quite reasonable. The extra-position of the bone is the excitement to the muscles to oppose, and just in proportion as the bone is brought back to the position in which their natural association becomes perfect, so do they cease to act in opposition. In placing a finger on the trochanter, I have found that the rate at Avhich it moves increases as it descends. The facility with which the associated muscles may take on this ofiice of assisting the reduction, must of course vary with the integrity of the muscles themselves, for some may be torn from their attachments. I have already stated a case of old dislocation, which I think I should have reduced, had I at the time of treating it been aware of principles I now under- stand ; and even in recent cases surgeons should know that they have more expedients than merely making extension, such as the changing occasionally the line of direction of the extending power.

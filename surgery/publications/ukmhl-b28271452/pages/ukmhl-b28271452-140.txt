SURGICAL PRACTICE. 86 person jump from a carriage going at a great speed, if it be on the right side of the vehicle, and his right leg come to the ground, his centre of gravity moves with a velocity and in a direction com- pounded of these two forces, — that of gravita- tion and of the forward motion; the whole force would be expended on the inner ankle, and of course the deltoid ligament would be ruptured, or, what very often happens, the extremity of the malleolus broken off. The moment this has hap- pened, the whole weight of the person comes upon the fibula. This, of course, is unable to sup- port so much force, being now placed out of its usual bearings, and the weight acting on the fibula obliquely to its axis breaks the bone about two or three inches above its connection with the tibia, this connection being too firm to give way. We have presented to us in the hospitals very many modifications of this accident — from that attended with great displacement to that of a strain only; and I believe that when the fibula is broken, not from violence applied at once to the bone, but by some slip of the leg, it is effected upon this principle—that of too’ much bearing on the fibula without rupture of the deltoid ligament. The causes of these injuries are, we find, in women, by getting a twist whilst walking in pat- tens, persons slipping off the curb, porters carrying loads, and taking a false step. Sometimes the del- toid ligament seems only strained; sometimes the small end of the malleolus is only broken olF, and the fibula broken ; sometimes the ligament

SUEGICAL PRACTICE. 139 sinus, and at the bottom a small piece of necrosed bone of the ischium, I have been able to trace the attack very often, in the children of the peasantry, to their lying about in wet grass. The attack is always that of acute inflammation, but varying much in degree; and the constitutional symptoms are often very severeâ€”so much so as often to make the nature of the complaint doubtful. The course of the very acute form, is to pass on to suppuration, and the pus may be formed under the periosteum, but also sometimes in the interspaces of the muscles, and of course always under the fascia. I am not able to decide whether the very acute attack is that which terminates most readily in the healthy functions of reparation. At all events, there are two states of periostitis changing the condition of the bone in two ways: the one where the whole energy of the periosteum is called forth, where the increased action subsides into a transi- tional state of the membrane, so that it assumes the greatest display of formative capabilities, by which it executes, unerringly and promptly, its conservative protection to the limb. The beauty and the efficacy of its accomplishment must strike all with admiration. This is that state which has the name of necrosis properly applied to it. The original bone is dead, and the periosteum com- mences its new function of supplying an equivalent by enclosing the dead with a living case, which is to be at once a new and perfect bone as well as an immediate substitute. The rapidity of this forma-

SUEGICAL ERACTICE. 210 appears to me to lead to a difficulty. It is said that a staff is to be passed down to the stricture, an open- ing is to be made behind it, and then the stricture is to be laid open. This is described as a proceeding much more easy than is practically the case. The staff is calculated to impede rather than to assist in the course of such an incision ; the instrument can- not be got to that part where it is wanted, and the slightest deviation laterally must direct the incision on the one or other side of the urethra. In short, it does nothing in pointing out to the operator the line of his incision, and thus the attempts to find the stricture, only lead to many unnecessary divi- sions of parts in the neighbourhood, by which more opportunity is given for the urine to burrow ; and with every care, and perfect acquaintance with the anatomy of the parts, the knife opens further into the pelvis than is required, by which effusions may take place about the bladder, and perhaps the patient may sink from this cause. I am of course now speaking of those cases where no fistulous opening exists, for if so, a probe passed through this sinus will be a guide for enlarging the aper- tures. The mode of opening into the membranous part of the urethra for the purpose of relieving retention of urine is precisely that, which is the chief step to be adopted in the operation of lithotomy. The operator, by passing his finger round the arch and rami of the j)ubes, can gain a sufficiently accurate knowledge of that circle of which the point where the urethra passes through the triangular ligament is the centre. To this point he directs his knife.

30 SURGICAL PRACTICE, reduction of the luxation ; and I have also known the administration of full doses of tartar emetic without exciting nausea, and not at all administer- ing aid to reduction. The warm bath likewise has been valueless in my experience. I need not say that in old dislocations these expedients are quite nugatory. In those falls which old people are exposed to, so that the whole force of the violence is received laterally upon the upper part of the humerus, the blow is expended upon the glenoid cavity of the scapula, or on its neck. The latter fracture has been denied by some surgeons who have been in- quisitive to detect it. In this way, however, cer- tainly some fractures may take place at this part of the scapula, presenting the sign of a falhng of the limb, and of crepitus on placing the thumb on the corocoid process. These cases occur generally in old persons, and usually do well; leaving the powers of the joint but little impaired. The treat- ment is simply preserving rest, and proper position. I have had several cases of fracture of different parts of the scapula: the most common is that of the inferior angle, and of some part of the spine of the bone. All these fractures are exceedingly painful for the first week or ten days. This may be accounted for by the injury being produced by direct violence, with consequent contusion of mus- cular fibres, which is always attended by great pain. These cases require no bandages, indeed a bandage only adds to the pain. The parts have nothing to prevent their remaining in quiet appo-

257 SURGICAL PRACTICE. when the surgeon is assured that it is formed. In doing this, I know it mil be sufficient often only to divide the skin and superficial fascia, leaving the deep fascia of the limb untouched. This is important to bear in mind, as it is hardly possible to divide the deep fascia without its going into slough to some extent; and thus in healing, the structures, particularly the muscles, are seriously injured in their functions, and the cicatrix is liable to break open on the muscular exertion, or any violence to the part. All cases do not require incision, and none very large or deep ones. Many cases present themselves at the hospital of this complaint at the elbow, arising from blows or falls upon the ancon of the ulnar, which pro- duce inflammation of the bursa over this part, and suppuration of it, the integument also participating in the mischief. These cases prove to be instances of the decided benefit of keeping the patient in bed, as they generally do AveU, although they often ex- hibit a formidable appearance. The inflammation of the bursa soon resolves itself into an abscess requiring a speedy opening; after which the wound quickly heals. I have often noticed, that when erysipelas has attacked a patient who has had a long standing disease of the skin, on the cessation of the inflam- mation, he has become quite cured of the chronic disease. There is an appearance on the surface which is often regarded as erysipelas, but which is of a different character. 1 allude to that erythematous s

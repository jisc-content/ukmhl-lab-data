The excited state being over, the- convalescent stage is that of great comparative depression ; and a nice management is required to guide the patient into perfect health. But the parts locally suffer so much that their condition is rendered very much worse than they were before the attack, since all the weak structures, having a vitality unable to resist the active excitement, suffer: thus the cellular tissue and fascia are sacrificed, the loss of which, in the ultimate healing of the wound, is attended by the worst consequences to the use of the limb, and therefore to the comfort of the patient, as then all the structures, particularly the muscles, become in- volved in the cicatrix; a condition of things pro- ductive of continual annoyance. I need hardly allude to the observance of all those cautions that I have insisted upon, regarding the rest of the limb, in the first stage of injury. It was formerly a favourite practice in the treat- ment of compound fractures, but a most pernicious one, for surgeons to seize any portion of bone that might project, and saw it off. Happily, a better scheme of treatment has been enterecl upon, al- though I have lately seen much mischief resulting from so unnecessary a step.

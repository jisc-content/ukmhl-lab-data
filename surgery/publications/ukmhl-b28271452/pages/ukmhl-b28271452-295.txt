As the leg is nearer the centre of circulation, so this complaint more commonly gets well when it occurs on this part than on the toes, without showing any indication of gangrene. I had under my care a gentleman with a sore on his leg that could not be traced to a recent hurt, but occurring in a part that many years before had been the seat of injury in hunting.

SURGICAL rKACTICE. 43 centre or axis in the joint; but the axis of motion is in a line passing through either ramus, so that the condyles are allowed to move forwards or back- wards upon this axis by means of the interarticular cartilage. The luxation is produced by muscular action, and in the open state of the mouth the external pterygoid muscle may start the condyles more forward, and thus place them under the zygoma. The indication is the finding the con- dyles anterior to their proper position. Almost every face lessens in breadth from the ear for- wards ; therefore the condyles are found projecting in a position anterior to that they have properly. The circumstance of the displacement acts upon the strong muscles of the temporal and the mas- seter to excite them to act inordinately, and sometimes very powerfully. The important point to be observed in the process for reduction is, to insure a steady and fixed position of the head; for want of this precaution, I have seen a patient drawn about a room in the manasâ€™ement of the O manipulation. The head should be placed firmly against the wall, and the direction of the force should be to move the bone about its own regular axis; that is, to press the condyle downwards and backwards, at the same time that the angle is brought forwards. I think these cases occur more usually when both sides are dislocated, than when only one is displaced. Of course, the necessary association of the muscles of deglutition is broken up, and thus swallowing is prevented. The pres-

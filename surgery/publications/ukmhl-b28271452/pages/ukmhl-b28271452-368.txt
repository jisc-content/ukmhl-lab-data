314 SURGICAL PRACTICE. I am not clear that any advantage arises from making an opening through the dura mater when there has been, or supposed to have been, blood. I have seen the longitudinal sinus of the dura mater opened; but no evil result followed; by a little pressure on it, it healed as well as the veins of the arm do in phlebotomy. I am unable to discover the reason of the propo- sition that has been made, for slicing off protrusion of the brain. The cavity of the skull is fitted for the natural bulk of the brain, and if the bulk of the organ is so enlarged that it presses out at any opening that will allow it to do so, the state which produces this enlargement will not be relieved by diminish- ing the mass. The rational view of the case is to cure the state, which is in fact hydrocephalic, and the influence of mercury is the means of cure. I believe all the cases in which 1 ever saw this pro- trusion happen have been quite young people. A boy was brought to the hospital not long since who had received a blow on the parietal bone, evi- dently produced by a force acting on the brain laterally: there was apparently a depression, but no wound. The symptoms were mild, and in a few days all pain in the head had passed off. But in about ten days there appeared over the spot where the depression was, a soft tumor which had quickly formed, and this in a day or two pulsated very obviously; as it seemed to increase, I made an opening into it, and out came a small quantity of brain. The tumor subsided, and the wound of the lancet healed. I put him upon mercurial treat-

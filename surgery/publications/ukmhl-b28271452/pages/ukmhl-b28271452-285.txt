SURGICAL PRACTICE. 231 most serious clanger. We find that veins, when injured, heal; and after phlebotomy this not only readily takes place, but leaves the tube perfect. This is mainly the result of the free and undis- turbed exercise of its function when the limb is in perfect repose: but if to the irritation of the ori- ginal wound, the injurious influence of constant motion be added, then all the dangers of active phle- bitis of the part may be called forth. As far as I have observed, the treatment of this formidable complaint, in its most active form, is included in the full action of the bowels until good secretions are obtained; the application of leeches where they can be applied; and as the course of this inflamma- tion is that which we find in other serous mem- branes, in obtaining the specific influence of mer- cury. Although we may trace the greater number of sore legs to the presence of varix, yet we have in females another source for the origin and en- durance of them, arising out of the ainenorrhoeal state, in whom, if a slight rub or hurt occurs, this trivial cause will readily originate a most trou- blesome sore, which becomes the field of action for the fitful influences of a perverted function, which at all times is prone to call forth its sympathies. It often happens that each leg is in these cases the subject of these revulsions; and if an ulcer exists, it most commonly establishes the vicarious men- struation once a month. Of course the first step in these cases is to restore the healthy function of the uterus.

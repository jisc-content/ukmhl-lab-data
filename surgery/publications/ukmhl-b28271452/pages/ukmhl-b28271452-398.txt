In the more moderate state, the discharge being viscid, and concreting on the least exposure to the atmosphere, produces an accumulated succession of hardened scabs, that successively form over the sore, as it goes on increasing in size, which crust has acquired the name of rupia from the form it takes, but this is a mere contingency, and not an essential character in the disease. If the sores be numerous, and advancing with rapidity under the peculiar ulcer- ative process that is taking place, the constitution then suffers so much, that it will not always bear the powerful exhibition of mercury, which active treatment can alone arrest the progress of the complaint; under this aggravated condition of the complaint, I have occasionally seen patients die of the venereal disease. The action of mercury is capable of curing this as well as that of the other forms, but it must be a full and steady impression of the remedy that can alone effect the purpose. The activity and rapidity of the sores, and their injurious influence on the system, sometimes in- terfere with the due administration of it, but where it can be made to have its full operation it is quite sufficient for the cure. I have seen instances of patients, in this state of disease, although suffering all the annoyances of a full salivation, declare themselves quite strong to what they were before the mercury was used, having their appetite restored and their nights good, and feeling altogether renovated. The state of relief they thus experience is a proof that the influence of syphilis produces the greatest constitutional disturbance.

LIVING VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL CELLS. 21 loped animals, is found in the circumstance that the impulse to formative development in the former seems to act almost without limit, and that the formative irritability in their growing parts persists, as from every young twig a young tree may be raised, whilst the growth in the most highly organised animals stops at a certain limit, and no multiplication from single parts (with the exception of the fertilised ovum), no genuine vegetative multipli- cation is known. If a tree always remains under the same conditions of nutrition, moisture, and climate, if it neither be- comes diseased nor is in any other way injured, we might imagine that it would eternally continue to live and grow. Even if we were to saw it off above its main root, new buds would spring up between the wood and the bark, or from the roots, which again would grow into branches; branches would strike new roots, and whilst the stem and the majority of the roots of the former giant tree had barely decayed, several young saplings would have already sprung up, of which the most vigorous, the iftost rapidly growing, would overwhelm the others, secure for itself light and air, and after a thousand years a new giant tree would replace the old one. Thus this plant, provided that it has not been exterminated by root and branch, cannot be annihilated; it does not require organs of fructification to produce never so many generations; it persists through countless ages by its own inherent formative force. Nutrition and formation are here one and the same; the nutritive sap, the temperature, the conditions of moisture, are at the same time both nutritive and formative stimulus. The tree is (with the exception of the wood) continu- ally growing in all its parts, ever young, ever able to reproduce from itself, without the act of fertilisation, new individuals. If we fully take in the conception of this immense formative vegetative energy and persistency, and then compare with it the very limited measure of vegetative life, and the necessity of the connection of two sexes for the reproduction of new individuals, which is always moi-e or less liable to the casualties of contact; and if we consider the rapidity with which the growth may be arrested in the most highly organised animals, then the forma- tion of animals will no longer appear as the result of the highest, but rather of an already diminished generative force. After having recognised persistent growth, unimpeded forma- tion, as the most important manifestation of life, as the essential

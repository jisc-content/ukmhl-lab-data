AND ITS TREATMENT. 57 asthenia originated and received its name from Beard. Very significant is it that Beard terms it an American disease," ivhich is never absent from a house whose inhabitants are intel- lectaally active:' Of course it occurs in all other civilised countries, but with far from the same enormous frequency as m the United States. The fact is not surprising to any one at all â– acquainted with the social relations which prevail in that country. Intensity and hurry of daily work, restlessness during the^ time devoted to recreation, short and troubled sleep, the strife of competition, chance, and circumstances impart a peculiar charac- ter to the social relations of North America, at least in manufac- turing and commercial circles.

In the evening when the business is over we young fellows go at once to the restaurant, where we eat and drink and amuse ourselves till two or three in the morning. Of course I do not get enough sleep, as I have to get up at seven. When I travel for the business, I always do so at night, so as to utilise the day for work."

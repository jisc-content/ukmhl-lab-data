SALZER ON THE HEALING-IN OF FOREIGN BODIES. 137 rounded, until finally immediately at the surface tliey are less densely packed together, and show quite irregular conditions of growth and multiplication. Frequently the increase in size of the cell is associated with so considerable a decrease of the fibril- lary intercellular substance that a whole layer of cells appears to be in direct contact with it, or at least only separated from it by a very minute amount of intercellular substance, structureless, or consisting of extremely delicate fibres. A sharp boundary-line towards the interior is frequently absent, in many instances there may be seen a granular mass, which perhaps may have been produced by the disintegration of the cells and intercellular substance, in which here and there a larger nucleus may still remain visible. Moreover, if the cells have no endothelioid arrangement, and if between them there are still visible distinct connective-tissue fibres (not arranged concentrically, but rather radially), then the more or less smooth inner surface may also be formed by such a layer of most delicate fibres. In closely-adjacent delicately-walled connective tissue capsules around quiescent smooth foreign bodies, the layer of the enlarged connective-tissue corpuscles and their increase in number are very inconsiderable; the delicate fibre-bands are concentrically arranged almost up to the inner surface. In the examination of older cases, a condition which might indicate cellular infiltration of the walls could never be de- monstrated ; it is only a question of increasing growth of the connective-tissue cells and final proliferation of these (and degeneration of the protoplasm), and in the same succession of retrogressive metamorphoses of the intercellular substance from the gradual indistinctness to the complete disappearance of the fibrillary structure. I never succeeded in finding a genuine endothelial layer in a cyst formed around foreign bodies, as had been demonstrated by Landzert, Soli, Bruecke, Reichert, KoelliJcer, Heineke, and especially by Tillmanns, for the inner surface of articulations, in contradiction to Albert, Hueter, Gerlach, and others. It barely needs mentioning that the same beautiful appearances which Tillmanns and others of the afore-named authors have seen in articulations, had likewise repeatedly been produced and observed in favourable preparations. In the case of cysts around foreign bodies, even if they contained the clearest serum, and if

136 SALZER ON THE HEALING-IN OF FOREIGN BODIES. As in older preparations, the gradual transitions from the endothelioid-cells of the inner layer to the delicate connective- tissue corpuscles of the external fibrous layers are perceptible; moreover, as in the more recent preparations of cysts enclosing foreign bodies, as also in the case of healed-in glass-wool, the endothelioid cells have been observed at the same time with the development of a very rich vascular network, I have no reason to doubt the origin of endothelioid-cells for the connective-tissue cells, by proliferation of the latter. The older preparations are distinguished from the more recent by their relative poverty in vessels. I have further to remark, as regards the formation of giant- cells, that I have never found genuine tubercle giant-cells in the innermost layer of cysts enclosing foreign bodies, but I have ob- served larger multinuclear endothelioid cells. The innermost layer at any rate does not so very regularly present the formation of giant-cells, as Weiss supposes. At the utmost, such formations might be spoken of in some isolated places. Appearances of a sharply-circumscribed mass of protoplasm, with a few spherical cells, were several times observed in the endothelioid layer, in places where the vascularisation was becoming indistinct. The explanation of these as sections through the not yet canalised sprouts of vessels, may not be discarded without further con- sideration. The microscopical examination of the cyst-wall around foreign bodies demonstrated mostly large endothelioid-cells, and in many instances also an arrangement of the bands of the con- nective tissue of the inner layer, which materially differed from that of the external layers of the capsule. As a rule, in each of such cysts, around concentrically arranged tracts of fibres of connective tissue (which in the case of objects which produce very little irritation by their weight or irregular surface, or in quiet animals, e.g., rabbits, are moderately poor in cells; but in the case of heavy rough foreign bodies, and when there is much movement, as, e.g., in an artisan's hand, are moderately rich m nuclei), and also on the inner aspect of these layers of connective tissue in which the concentric arrangement of the fibrillfe is lost, and the fibrillfo themselves become irregular, the lumen of num- erous vessels is observed, while at the same time the cells around the connective-tissue nuclei become more distinct and more

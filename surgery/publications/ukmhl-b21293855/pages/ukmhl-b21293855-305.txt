DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 291 been persistently profuse, which she attributed to the change of life. As she had been undergoing treatment for a considerable period without any result, and the lungs were quite healthy, with the exception of slight emphysema, I proposed a vaginal exami- nation, which, however, was declined. A year later, one of my colleagues informed me that she con- sulted him, and was then vaginally examined. A fibroid about the size of the fist was found protruding into the vagina. This was removed ; the menorrhagia and the asthma ceased. Other writers have reported cases where displacement and catarrh of the uterus, leucorrhoea, &c., were at the bottom of the attacks of asthma they sufiered from. That form of asthma, due to spasm of the diaphragm, seems to me to be particularly frequent in women.

Unable to breathe properly she became almost maniacal, springing out of bed and knocking everything about her. In the intervals she was confused and melancholy. No remedies did her any good. About this time she became pregnant by her lover, and her symptoms completely disappeared. She married and bore a

229 ZIEMSSEN ON SYPHILIS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. It remains for me to say a little about tlie treatment of syphilis of the nervous system. After a pretty extensive personal expe- rience, which agrees with that of other physicians who have paid attention to this question, I advise you as follows: in those affections of the nervous system I have mentioned, as well as in several others running a severe course, if there is a syphilitic history, and if the affection is not too far advanced, make at least an attempt with antisyphilitic treatment, and if you have any success go on with it most energetically. I can only repeat what has been often said, the harm that can follow such an attempt is in any case trifling, while the benefits may be the greatest possible, namely, the preservation of life. Iodide of potassium is generally sufficient in this kind of tentative course, but if the experiment is attended with success it will not do to remain content with that; energetic treatment with mercury must be added. You will also along with those two drugs employ the other therapeutic methods which experience has proved efiectual in inveterate syphilis, in particular the use of the hot springs of Aix-la-Chapelle and Wiesbaden, hydropathy, sarsaparilla, &c. In a case of this kind requiring specific treatment to be continued over a long period, I agree with Fournier, Neisser, and Rumpf, who advise alternate courses of mercury and the iodide. Only in this way can we be certain of guarding against a continuance or a return of the syphilis in the brain or spinal cord.

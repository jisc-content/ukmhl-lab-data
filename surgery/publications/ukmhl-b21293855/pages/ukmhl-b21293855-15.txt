ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF LIVING- VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL CELLS. A BIOLOGICAL STUDY. By TH. Billroth. —♦— Those who have followed with earnest interest the great develop- ment of the medical and surgical sciences during recent times certainly will hail with genuine satisfaction the elucidation of so many hazy speculative opinions which, especially on the causes of disease, have been handed down to us by our predecessors. It is scarcely twenty years since what was called "the genius epidemicus and endemicus " of disease, the different character of the healing tendency of wounds during this or that state of the weather, the causation of pyeemia by the emanations of patients affected with suppuration, and of pneumonia by chills, the indi- vidual predisposition to this or that disease, had been maintained as undoubted facts. And now, that all this should no longer be true! Now the general shibboleth is: " Microbes !" The cause of suppuration in general: " Microbes!" The cause of pyaemia: " Microbes!" The cause of pneumonia: " Microbes !" The cause of the formation of tubercles: " Microbes !" Indeed, the modern pathological anatomy of the present day propounds the theorem, Acute and c\ronic inflammations are almost in every case -produced by Microbes."" Only a few poisons when repeatedly and for a longer period introduced into the body may cause chronic inflammatory processes—e.g., alcohol (cirrhosis of the liver, chronic gastritis), phosphorus (maxillary osteitis). Several substances—viz., cantharides, mustard-oil, petroleum, the oils of turpentine and of croton, and ammonia— call forth to the extent to which they come into contact with tissues acute suppurative inflammations, but without ever pro- ducing progressive phlegmonous processes. Cases of accidental application of the last-mentioned substances are so extremely rare that on the whole they may be entirely omitted from the

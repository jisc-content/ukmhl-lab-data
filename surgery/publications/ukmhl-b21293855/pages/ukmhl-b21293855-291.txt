DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 277 Case II.â€”Temporary Aspermatismti.s, foUoiued hy imiootence. Spermatmrhcea. Neurasthenia. Severe Asthma. In July, 1880, Mr. R., a miller, consulted me on account of severe asthma and a distressing feeling of depression. Patient was 48, medium height, well built, muscles well developed, and body well covered. He had five children, the youngest being ten years old; no symptoms of hereditary disease. He was accompanied by his wife, a very intelligent woman, who volunteered the following statement: " Doctor, I shall just tell you the cause of his illness; my husband has been completely impotent since he was 38 years old, and even before he was never quite right in this respect."

After repeated intra-vaginal friction the penis lost erectile power without ejaculation occurring. In fact, under no conditions did ejaculation follow connection. He, therefore, aided the process by withdrawing the penis after more or less vaginal friction and then manually excited it until ejaculation was imminent, whereupon he quickly reintroduced the organ. In this way Mr. R. begat five exceptionally vigor- ous and mentally and bodily healthy children. When 38, in spite of great bodily strength, he completely lost sexual power, and from that time his present illness first began to assume a definite character. His wife mentioned this when he first consulted a doctor, and added she drew the attention of the different medical men he saw to this circumstance, none of whom, however, attached any importance to it. The above-mentioned attacks of dread and depression, which had never quite left him since his 18th year, became frequenter

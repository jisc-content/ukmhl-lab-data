BILLROTH ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF 46 cause of these gall formations, a second alleged cause seems to me likewise of but doubtful importance. It is asserted by many that the gall formation is caused, and especialUj its enlm-cjement is brought about, by the suction of the sap, by mites, lice, and larvce (maggots). Irrespectively of the fact that galls frequently are already developing before tbe animals have escaped from their eggs, and of the fact that, e.g., perfectly abnormal gall-hair formations of leaves which are entirely different from the normal hairs of the leaves, may not possibly be produced by the suction of the plant-juice, also in this supposition the production of specifically organised new formations as the galls, remained abso- lutely unexplained. If there occur, e.g., in the lime leaves, according to the action of different kinds of mites, either hair- formations, or pocket-galls, or leaf-rolls, and if we are informed that, e.g., of certain kinds of Goccidce {Brachyscelis pileata, ovicida, and duplex) on the Eucalyptus species in Australia, the males form tubular or trumpet-shaped galls with an opening at the apex, the females on the contrary produce thick utricular galls closing with a lid, we can scarcely understand that this is brought about by suction of the juices alone, if at all. If, once more, we inquire into the said mechanical causes, we may have to admit that certain excesses of supply (" jjberschwem- mung") of nutritive material have to be considered of more importance as a cause of irritation for the production of hyper- plasia in vegetable than in animal cells, and that the vegetable cell in general possesses a greater hereditary disposition for it. Still we ought to suppose that in this case at the most only a hypertrophic and hyperplastic process analogous to the formation of callus could be brought about which ought to show the type common to all the new formations which form after injuries in plants. We may imagine the suction-apparatus with its bite never so different, the suction-movement in its intensity and rhythm never so varied, still we could not always understand why so many different forms of galls are thus produced. I will only briefly mention that ,the suction-action does not all come into consideration in the formation of Mycocecidia.*^ *By the suction of the apple aphis or American blight (" Blutlaiis," Schizoneura lanigera) conditions may be produced which are known by the name of canker of the apple-tree; from this formation, however, to the organisation of complicated galls there is a long step.

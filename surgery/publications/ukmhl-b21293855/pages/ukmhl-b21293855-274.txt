260 EKB ON PROGRESSIVE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, Made by combining four different sections from as many different cases. A. From the hypertrophied deltoid of a tyincal juveiiile case ; showing' almost everywhere very much enlarged fibres with increase in the nuclei, slitting (s), and vacuolation {v); slight increase in connective tissue with abundant nuclei. B. From the atrophied biceps of an indeterminate case (juvenile ? pseudo- hyperbrophic ?) showing muscle-fibres of very different sizes, with great proliferation of the nuclei, abundant slitting (s), and here and there vacuolation (y); connective tissue very much overgrown and with nume- rous niiclei; no fat deposit. C. From the enlarged serratus magnus of a pseudo-hypertrophic case (our third case). Muscle-fibres mostly atrophied, here and there enlarged and slit (s) ; abundant firm connective tissue ; large deposits of fat cells. D. From the very atrophied biceps of a juvenile case, showing little else than adipose tissue lying among stout bands of connective tissue, the vessels of the latter very much thickened {g); small insulated patches of muscle-fibre in some places still ver/ much enlarged {h) with numerous nuclei.

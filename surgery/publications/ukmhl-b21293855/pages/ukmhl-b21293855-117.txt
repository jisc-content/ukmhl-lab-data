ON THE HEALING-IN OF FOREIGN BODIES. —♦— Foreign bodies which have gained an entrance into the human organism call forth disturbances and alterations which, in the first place, depend essentially on the locality, that is, the organ concerned, or in other words, on the kind of injury ; in the second place, on the nature of the foreign body. ^ As in the following we shall especially consider the reaction of the organism against these foreign bodies with regard to their physical condition, but without reference to the danger of the injury itself, we shall have, in a more restricted sense, to dis- tinguish between the effects of unclean foreign bodies (as we call, for the sake of brevity, those which do not carry with them pathogenic germs), and of clean foreign bodies acting either mechanically or chemically. The former, i.e., the unclean foreign bodies, have been considered from the oldest times as the deplorable cause of the interest and the treatment in every kind of retention of foreign bodies. The belief in the danger from foreign bodies is mostly based on the experience of the injurious consequences of this first-mentioned kind. At present, however, both the estimate of the case and its treatment begin more and more to agree that these represent merely a fraction of the foreign bodies which come under obser- vation, although already in former times, ever since Ambroise Pare, and especially since the time of the great John Hunter, the expectant treatment has found observant and thoughtful advocates. The reaction of the organism, apart from the traumatic inflam- mation, which is eventually due to the specific pathogenic germs, as a rule does not lead to healing-in, and will therefore not come within the scope of this paper. The reaction in the case of clean foreign bodies, so far as they act in an essentially chemical or toxic manner, experimental pathology has elucidated as regards the effect on the general organism. The knowledge of the local alterations, as a rule,

8G NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT. Weir-Mitcliell's work, " Fat and Blood," and also Beard's on Nenrastlienia—both have appeared in German dress—as being really most interesting books. I am not thereby prevented from warning you most urgently against the straitlaced systematic methods of treatment which are flourishing just now and doing much damage in the world. Could we but compute how many people have had their lives sacrificed to irrational fat-reducing treatment and its accompaniments, you would assuredly be astonished at the high mortality. Systematic methods of treatment constitute a great danger in the hands of a physician who does not individualise, and especially in those of a layman.

PEYER ON ENURESIS NOCTURNA IN MALES. 344 Instead of bougies, Winternitz's psyclirophor may be used, especially when micturition is accompanied by slight smarting, or seminal emissions occur with the penis flaccid. The application of astringents, e.g., instillation of 1 per cent, or more of a solution of tannin or alum is at times useful. Nitrate of silver I also use, but never stronger than 1 per mille. Oberlander has obtained excellent results in several cases by means of his dilator. In Case VII. I used this instrument twice with a favourable issue. I have, however, not sufficient experience as yet to enable â€¢ me to judge whether it yields better results than the treatment I have described above. Under local treatment I include the application of electricity. The cathode is introduced into the urethra or bladder, and the anode placed over the lumbar spinal cord, or inserted into the rectum. In such a case the cathode acts not only electrically but also as a bougie, by the frequent application of which Sir Henry Thompson has often effected a cure.

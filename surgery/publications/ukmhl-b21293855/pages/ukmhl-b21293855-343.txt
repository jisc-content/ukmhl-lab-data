329 THE CAUSES AND TEEATMENT OF SEVERE AND OBSTINATE CASES OF ENURESIS NOCTURNA IN MALES. When Oberlander in his "current communications on the aetiology and treatment of enuresis nocturna in boys" begins with the following sentence, " the results which the present treatment of enuresis nocturna have to show are certainly of not such a nature that new and fuller views of the subject will not be welcomed," every medical man who has had to deal with obstinate cases of nocturnal incontinence will agree with him. From this standpoint I should like to contribute something to our know- ledge of the causes and treatment of this affection. I emphasise the word muse, because this complaint, like the irritable bladder, is not a disease in itself, but only a symptom which may represent quite different pathological conditions. Moreover, Leopold Oasper states in his translation of Sn- H. Thompson's work on "Diseases of the Urinary Passages," "nothing certain is known of the production and etiology of enuresis nocturna—deep sleep, taking too much liquid, &c., can no longer claim our assent"—and yet the majority of publica- tions deal only with the treatment of the affection. A number of different methods and drugs have been recommended, their influence being extolled in one case or another. Very frequently, however, the cause is not taken into consideration at all, i.e., the pathological basis which lies at the bottom of the symptom of incontinence. If we are ignorant of the cause every line of treatment is haphazard in action, and its publication has but little value in the eyes of another medical man, as it affords him no guide as to how he should proceed in any other case where the incontinence may depend on a diametrically opposite cause. It is far from my object in maintaining that henceforth in all, or even in the majority of cases, it will be possible, even after thp

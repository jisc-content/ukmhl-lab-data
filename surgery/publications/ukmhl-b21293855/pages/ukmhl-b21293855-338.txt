STUUMPELL ON TRAUMATIC NEUllOSES. S2i action into the motor paths, the symptoms generally disappear in a very short time. All other kinds of treatment (electricity, massage, hydrotherapeutics, &c.) must be looked upon merely as mental aids to this—though no doubt often very valuable aids. In other cases, however, local traumatic neurosis proves itself to be a very obstinate trouble, and may last for months, or longer. But even in these we must not give up hopes of ultimate recovery. AVith your permission I shall conclude with a brief resume :— 1. After a severe general concussion of the central nervous system there is often produced a complicated but very characteristic set of nervous symptoms, the best name for which is "general traumatic neurosis." In its features this affection has a strong resemblance partly to neurasthenia, partly to hysteria, and partly to certain of the psychoses (melancholia and hypo- chondriasis). In its causation purely psychical elements predominate, but very probably we should also allow for a continued influence of the psychical shock, though this does not take the form of coarse anatomical changes. In the individual cases we must pay attention some- times more to the one set of influences, sometimes raore to the other, so that we cannot analyse all ot them in the same way. , 2 In certain cases where the injury acts locally-and generally, though not exclusively, in these cases it affects one of the limbs-we may have severe nervous disturbances in the affected part. These are produced in all probability, through the influence of the menta emotions associated with the receipt of the uijury and maybe looked upon as "hysterical" in their nature. Every nervous affection may be called "hysterical (the name is certainly not a suitable one, but is in common use) which depends on a derangement^ the normal connection between the psychical and the, in the nan-ower sense of the word, physical processes.

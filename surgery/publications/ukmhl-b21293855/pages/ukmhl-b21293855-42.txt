BILLROTH ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF 32 pensations in ijatliological processes " (" Veber Anpassungen und Ausgleicliungen hei jMthologischen Ztistanden "), favour the supposi- tion that increased function principally acts as a " nutritive" stimulus, i.e., that the increase in mass, with the increased action of muscles and glands, is principally brought about by enlarge- ment of the functional tissue elements (hypertrophy), but scarcely traceable to multiplication of these (hyperplasia). To this the arteries of medium size apparently are an exception, which immensely thicken and elongate for the establishment of the collateral circulation, This interstitial hyperplasia of the walls of the vessels, however, is not the immediate consequence of the increased muscular action above the ligature, it does not occur even in the ligatured arteries above the ligature, and therefore could not be compared with the hypertrophy of the left ventricle in consequence of stenosis of the aorta. On the contrary, it occurs in those arteries which, branching off above the ligature, establish the collateral circulation. I am unable to decide whether Nothnagel's hypothesis be correct, that tlie increased velocity of the blood current in these small arteries, which ai*e devoid of vasa vasorum, causes the nutrition, and thereby the hypertrophy and hyperplasia, of the elements of the vascular walls. At any rate, it does not conform with this view if we consider the lessened velocity of the current and the increased pressure in the veins as formative stimulus as the cause of the development of varicosities, a view which, as I have already stated, I do not share, though I am unable to substitute for it a more feasible explanation.* I shall now treat of the formative stimuli which are called forth by a groiving vegetable cell upon the cells of the animal organism. I have no personal experience on Lepra, but Michdiczs re- searches on Bhinoscleroma had been carried out under my eyes at a time when the bacterial etiology which had been propounded by von Frisch at a much later period had not even been thought of. A kind of firm granulation tissue is produced, of which we at present know that it must have emanated from the fixed elements of the connective tissue by formation of cells of epithelial (or * The latest experiments of Ponfick on the immense capability of regeneration of the liver after excision of even very large portions of it are of particular great interest. This process is so powerful that it probably can only be brought about by a genuine " hyperplasia:' It is the most considerable instance of regeneration hitherto known of in warm-blooded animals.

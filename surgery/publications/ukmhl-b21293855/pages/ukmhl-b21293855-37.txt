LIVING VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL CELLS, 27 gravitates (iron, lead), and thereby continually, but very slowly, causes new slight solutions of continuity, which again will call forth new -slight formative stimuli; behind it the tissue closes with the most minute formation of cicatrix, whilst before it new young tissue, though in the most minute quantity, continues to form. The mechanical irritation also by sharp-pointed edges (glass) comes into consideration; by these longer and more inten- sive formative stimuli are kept up ; the capsules which form around such bodies become thick and callous, their inner surface becomes permanently organised and commences to exude serum into the interior ; thus a cyst forms around the foreign body. The formation of new bursES mucosEC under callosities, which have been considered as effects of pressure, may likewise be ex- plained as the effect of frequently repeated minute interruptions of continuity of tissue, as the single effects of pressure may be imagined to be divided. Or we might likewise regard as forma- tive stimuli the continuous effects of pressure which do not materially disturb the tissue and the circulation. That would also represent a new cause of formative stimulus, against which no objection could well be raised. We cannot dismiss the problem of the formative stimulus produced by the presence of foreign bodies without mentioning a phenomenon in which this stimulus probably acts with its highest power, namely, the effect of a large sequestrum enclosed luithin cm osseous capsule on the continuously increasing, though not unHmited, thickening of this osseous capsule, as long as the sequestrum remains in it. Circumscribed accumulations of pus in the medulla, and large yellow tubercles, may likewise call forth a formative stimulus on the cambium layer at the surface of the bone. Such a stimulus may occasionally also produce extensive stalactite-like formations of osteophytes in tuberculous articular epiphyses. But such new formations of bone will not under any other circumstances take place with the same regu- larity as around the sequestrum. That this really is pre- eminently a mechanical stimulus—the chemical stimulus in this case is probably of minor importance—that it is brought on by the dead bone is evident from the fact that after the removal of the sequestrum all further thickening of the tony shell ceases, and that after the extraction of the sequestrum the filling up of the remaining empty cavity as a rule takes place very slowly, and

SALZER ON THE HEALING-IN OF FOREIGN BODIES. 140 advantage of this kind of experience of healing-in of foreign bodies for therapeutic purposes. The successful experiments in the healing-in of foreign bodies have been ever since the introduction of the antiseptic method, and evidently only through this, on the increase, whilst formerly foreign bodies were exclusively employed only as unfailing exciters of suppuration (setons), or, at the most, in order to produce a cicatricial canal (lead-wire in webbing of the fingers). Now-a-days silk, catgut, decalcified bone, elastic ligatures, wire, steel nails, iodoform gauze (Winiwarter), and even fluids, as blood and jodo- form-glycerine and other substances, are employed for healing-in. The healing-in of these substances has only partly in view their persistent action as ligature, suture {Lister's silver-wire suture of the patella), local irritation (ivory-pegs in the broken ends of the bone), tampon, &c. The healing-in is here only a more or less unpleasant necessity in order to bring about in deep-seated injuries, in spite of the introduced foreign body, a definite, complete union by first intention of the skin or soft parts, and thus to shorten the duration of the cure. The experience that heavy foreign bodies, leaden bullets, in moving parts of the body, and in soft tissues, are found in cystic spaces, in capsules of connective tissue, moreover, older and personal observations on the mode of healing-in of smooth (pointed, sharp-edged) pieces of glass, lead to the conviction that by a similar process of healing-in, artificial cavities might be produced which would be of great importance for securing a cavity after resection in the joints, especially for the establish- ment of artificial joints, and which, moreover, would probably be of value in regions of the body in which, according to experience, cicatricial traction is fraught with danger, as in serous cavities, in articulations, in the sheath of tendons, and in the meningeal space. For the latter especially the employ- ment of glass-plates for the protection of the adherent brain- cicatrices seems to be not a hopeless proceeding. We have succeeded in producing in animals the wished-for result of the formation of pseudo-arthroses. In man a similar effect was attempted in a case of resection of the elbow; several layers of gutta-percha tissue were placed between the smoothly sawn-off" surfaces of the bones, with the view of preventing, by the temporary insertion of a smooth foreign body, the primary

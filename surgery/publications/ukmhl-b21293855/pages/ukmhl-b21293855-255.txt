I should except the face: there is iiotliing abnormal in respect either of function or of size in the muscles of expression, the muscles of mastication, of the tongue, and of the throat. On the other hand, in the trunk and in the upper extremities the muscles affected are almost the same as in the two previous cases, only that in this case a larger number of the muscles appear to be hj'-pertrophied while they nevertheless show motor weakness.

133 SALZER ON THE HEALING-IN OF FOREIGN BODIES. their walls appeared perfectly smootli and shining, the most varied preparations, also those produced by the very unreliable silver-process {'^ Silherhilder"), never yielded similar results, as, e.g., in surface preparations {"Abstreif2yraepartiten"), including the transition from articular cartilage to synovial capsule. It seems that there is never a cellular-investment layer strictly differentiated from the other kinds of connective tissue. As little can an endothelial investment of the kind be observed, as has been found in hygroma of the sheaths of the tendons (in tenosynovitis). In these, by an injection of a solution of ^ per cent, of silver, an endothelial layer of two to three strata of large pear-shaped, also of spherical cells with large distinct nuclei, can be demonstrated in glycerine preparations, a condition which cannot be found in secondary hygromas, so-called " bursaB .mucosa," or accessory bursee, the inner wall of which rather reminds one of the afore-described capsules around foreign bodies, as the large, irregular, densely-arranged cells of their inner wall, the trabeculi and septa, possess in every respect the character of the connective-tissue cells. In the case of foreign bodies partially lodged in physiological cavities with epithelial or endothelial investment, an advance of this epithelium or endothelium to the remainder of the wound —a genuine epithelial investment of walls being thus formed— is, from a theoretical standpoint, certainly admissible. I myself have no experience of this occurrence. If the injury be considerable, the inner wall presents the appearance of wearing away of the connective tissue with persistent irritation and disintegration of the innermost layer; if the injury, however, be but slight, there will be signs of a lesser degree of irritation (of cell proliferation) in the fibrillary tissue. The distribution of the vessels is highly remarkable. There is in every case a poverty of vessels in the external layers of the capsule, and an extraordinary richness in the inner layers; but there are also varieties of termination and distribution of the vessels in the richly vascularised inner layer, and whilst m some cases the ends of the vessels evidently do not advance to the surface, where, on the contrary, they are wanting between the most superficial endothelioid cells, the particularly^ rich vascular network is in other cases of more recent origin so

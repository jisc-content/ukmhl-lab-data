ASTHMA AND DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. (Asthma sexuale.) —♦— As we all know, the pathology of asthma has already undergone various-modifications. For some time past two forms have been recognised: Bronchial Asthma and Nervous Asthma. Under the first we comprehend those cases where an excess of bronchial secretion is present. This forms the well-known three layers of expectoration in the spit-jar: purulent, ropy, and frothy mucus. Examination of the lungs reveals the signs of chronic bronchial catarrh, which is constantly kept up by acute attacks. According to Boeker (German medical weekly journal. No 26 and 27, 1888), asthma is generally caused by the state of the bronchial mucosa. No proper anatomical idea was connected with the expression "nervous asthma"; there was only a vague impression that nervous processes had something to do with its causation. This view was often questioned by the representatives of the anatomical school of this century. It was held that asthma was no nervous affection at all, but always connected with emjohysema and bronchitis, and even Laennec was of the opinion that the chief cause of asthma was catarrhe sec and emphysema. On the other hand, several authorities on asthma, asRamadge, Berg son, &c., maintained that asthma cannot be explained without assuming a nervous element. In later times, however, we know definitely that asthma is a pure neurosis which has just as much a substantive existence as many other nervous affections, e.g., megrim, epilepsy, &c. Hence, in the light of this knowledge we must regard every case as a symptom of some underlying disease, and must direct our attention, as regards aetiology, to the nervous processes, however obscure. The onset of an attack of asthma is explained by irritation of the central nervous system, wherever the path lies the

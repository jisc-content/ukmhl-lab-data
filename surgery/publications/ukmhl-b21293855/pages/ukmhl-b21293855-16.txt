6 BILLROTH ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF etiology of inflammatory processes. The inflammations and sup- imrations, inclucUng the common suppitration of tuounds, ivhich we meet in medical and surgical practice, are the effects of Microbes. It is a hard strain on men of the older and middle-aged generations now to throw overboard all their former convictions, and with these at the same time the enormous lumber of thera- peutics suggested by these now discarded views. They must have some misgivings that their medical craft will prove too light, and will drift without helm and compass, as the shipping of the new freight can neither be easily nor speedily enough effected. I still vividly bear in mind how I myself, though I was in the midst of the movement, and perhaps in some degree its origi- nator, frequently apprehended that it might prove too rapid and one-sided. Certainly surgery has, as regards the therapeutics, carried off the lion's share. I also have very cautiously followed the movement, testing every step and weighing every detail, until I felt fully convinced and became a zealous advocate of the new doctrine, and enthusiastically pursued the new direction. What in the beginning I sadly missed, principles strictly based upon natural science for the methods of the antiseptic operations and treatment, and what I in vain aimed at in my finally aban- doned researches on the coccobacteria septica, had afterwards been advised by others in such a successful manner that the anatomico-physiological details of these investigations, as well as the enormous painstaking work enhanced by these researches and its ingenious execution, have evoked in me wondering admiration. I have already demonstrated in earlier papers on traumatic fever and accidental traumatic affections—at a time when trau- matic and inflammatory fevers were still considered as so-called irritative fevers due to nervous action, and when pyaamia was believed to be a miasmatic disease entirely independent of those with which the injured patient may suddenly be seized in a similar manner as with acute traumatic fever—that inflammation, suppuration, and gangrene are intimately connected with trau- matic fever, inflammatory fever, pyasmia, and septicemia, and that they represent analogous processes in a progressive ratio of danger. - j • a This homogeneous arrangement of the traumatic and intlam- matdrv fevers was much more in accordance with the actual

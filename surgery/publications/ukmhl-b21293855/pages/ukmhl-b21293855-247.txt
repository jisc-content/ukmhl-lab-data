PROGRESSIVE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. ♦ Gentlemen,— We owe the notion of progressive muscular atrophy to the descriptions of Aran^ and Cruveilhier^ and above all to the incomparable clinical powers of Duchenne^. The disease they introduced us to under that name—^a chronic, insidious, slow, general muscular wasting—has in its various forms ke]3t up its interest for pathologists to this day. Nor has the conflict of opinion about these forms come to a halt. In our own day, in the last ten years, this interest has shown itself in the most lively way in a series of recorded cases and publications. New ways of looking at the facts have been proposed, new opinions have been formulated and actively discussed. These discussions appear to have essentially advanced our knowledge, clearing up, and in part reconciling the various mutually hostile views. To begin with, there were considerable differences of opinion abcat the nature and proper seat of the disease. One party .(Aran, Duchenne, Friedberg) explained it as a primary mnscular lesion, while another (Cruveilhier, L. Clarke, R. Remak, Eulenburg and Guttmann, and others) held that it was a disease taking origin in the nervous system—spinal cord or sympathetic. Gradually, however, under the influence of the French school, aided by a happy series of clinical and anatomical observations (Luys, Hayem, Charcot and Joffroy, Duchenne and Joffi-oy, Charcot and Gombault, &c.), the theory of the spinal. origin gained ground. By Charcot* in particular the theory, was developed in an attractive and convincing way, and chronic degeneration of the anterior horns of grey matter with dis- appearance of the large multipolar nerve-cells was laid down as its primary cause. But this view did not remain uncontradicted. It was very energetically opposed by Friedreich, who in his well 'known

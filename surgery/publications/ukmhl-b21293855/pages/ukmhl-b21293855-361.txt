347 RECENT ADVANCES IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE OF THE SPINAL CORD. INTRODUCTION. Up to the close of the first half of the present century the affec- tions of the spinal cord form, as is well known, one of the saddest chapters in the history of medicine. The scanty character of the knowledge of this subject possessed by physicians was equalled by the miserable success of their treatment, and we can understand only too well how it was that, for the great mass of the public, to say that one was suffering from affection of the spinal cord was precisely the same as saying that he was sinking under a chronic incurable disease. This state of matters has undoubtedly changed for the better during the last twenty or thirty years. The astonishing advance which has taken place in our knowledge of these diseases during that time has been accompanied by distinct progress in their therapeutics also, and though the latter has not been quite so marked as in the case of the former, we may nevertheless comfort ourselves to-day with the thought that the prognosis in a number of these affections is distinctly more favourable than it was wont to be. It would, however, be wrong to suppose that this encouraging change for the better is essentially or even mainly due to the acquirement of new remedies (i.e., previously unknown or unappreciated) against disease of the spinal cord. In the first place, progress in diagnosis has proved of pregnant value. We are now, through a more accurate knowledge of the various forms of spinal disease, and through the improvement in our methods of examination, placed in a position to recognise the most of these forms in a comparatively early stage, and at a period in which they are very much more amenable to treatment than they are later. Further, large. additions have been made to our knowledge of the effects

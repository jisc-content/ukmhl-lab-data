SALZER ON THE HEALING-IN OF FOREIGN HODIES. 121 perceytihle reaction, as, e.g., the sewing-needle, for which there is no histological evidence (this has been ascertained for steel m cartilages bv Bemeivtiew, and for jodoform-powder in the cavities of the body by Marchand); or 2nd, that they are encapsuled. The latter is brought about in that manner, viz., that the newly-formed con- nectiveÂ°tissue encompasses the foreign body, or that a larger amount of serous fluid is found between the capsule formed of connective tissue and the foreign body, in which case we have to speak either of the healmg-in in a more or less massy cicatrice, or of cyst formation. It is remarkable that at one side the nature of the healing-in of similar foreign bodies in difierent animals experimented on, as well as in the same individual in different organs, may differ; but that also, on the other hand, certain foreign bodies are found with special frequency in cysts, others again in wheals, which not only lead to the conclusion that the varieties of the injured organisms and organs decide the question, but also that the physical, or as far as the foreign bodies are somewhat soluble, as well as the chemical properties may be of decisive importance. It must here be pointed out, that very probably a third cause may be of importance for the manner of healing-in, as the organism under different mechanical conditions also differently reacts against the irritation from one and the same external mjury. Whilst stiff bandages, which are equally applied in a larger extent to the surface of the body, even if they fit very tightly, call forth no inflammatory reaction of the skin, the latter will very soon react against the never so slight unequal pressure of a hard foreign body. The effect of that will be materially assisted if the part of the body in question is moved, and thereby at one side the eroding effect of the foreign body, and on the other hand the increased hydrodynamic factors in the body tissues act injuriously. The pressure on the skin is particularly dangerous in portions of the body in which a thin layer of soft parts immediately lies on the skeleton, as in this case even the slightest effect of pressure can barely be counteracted by the elasticity of the thin layers of soft tissue, as from daily experience every coachman knows. Under the stated conditions, as is well known, either erosions or necrosis of the tissue, or formation of wheals, takes place, or that peculiar reaction of the organism consisting in the development of a cystic tumour in the depth between the soft and the hard layers, which we know by the name of bursa mucosa (hygroma).

FEMORAL OR CRURAL HERNIA. 132 g 6 caused by stricture of Pouparfs ligament itself, or the fascia running under it, or by the neck of the sac. The operation for dividing the part which occasions strangu- lation, is directed by Giinbernat to be performed as follows : After the preparatory steps have been taken, and the hernial sac divided, acanulated or grooved sound is to be introduced along the internal side of the intestine, until it enter the crural ring, when it is to be held with the left hand, firmly resting on the branch of the pubes, so that its back shall be turned towards the intestine, and its canal towards the symphysis pubis. A bistoury, with a narrow blade and blunt end, is then to be passed along the groove, until it enter the ring; after which both instruments are to be cautiously carried in- wards, along the branch, to the body of the pubes, drawing them out at the same time.—The internal edge of the cru- ral arch being thus divided, the parts will be reduced with the greatest ease.; and the danger of wounding the Fallopian liga- ment, and the spermatic and gastric vessels, will by this mode of operating be avoided. Under certain circumstances, however, the above means may be inadequate to the liberation of the displaced parts; in which case the following seems the preferable mode of proceeding. " Make a small incision between the fibres of the external oblique muscle, about half an inch above the ligament; and a director being passed carefully, and immediately under the liga- ment, and over the artery (which adheres to the ligament), cut into the groove of the director."—If, when this is done, the stricture be found at the mouth of the sac, it 7nust be divided inwards, to the pubes, inclining Pott's knife a little obliquely downwards.

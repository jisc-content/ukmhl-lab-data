58 ISSUES. Issues are artificial ulcers, made with the design of producing a permanent discharge of purulent matter.—Three different kinds are now in common use;—the blister-issue,—the pea- issue,— and the seton. The situations chosen for their formation will depend upon the p-.rticdlar morbid state of the system for which they are em- ployed.—The most frequent are, the nape of the neck; the middle of the humerus, or hollow of the deltoid muscle ; be- tween the shoulders, or ribs, and in the inside above or below the knee. Objectionable parts are, wherever there is not a sufficiency of cellular substance for the protection of the parts beneath;—im- mediately over the belly of a muscle ;— over a tendon, or thinly- tovered bone;—near any large blood-vessel. THE BLISTER-ISSUE. This is formed by the continued application of a small blister, or vesicant, to the part, until the scarf-skin is destroyed ; when being removed, the discharge is to be promoted by milder appli- cations of the same nature with the vesicant, alternately with sjme mild liniment, according to the degree of the discharge required. THE PEA-ISSUE Is formed by making an incision with a lancet, or by the ap- plication of caustic.

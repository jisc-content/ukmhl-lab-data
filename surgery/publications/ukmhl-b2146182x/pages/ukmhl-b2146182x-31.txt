The means of effecting the second indication, now almost sole- ly employed by modern surgeons, is an incision made with a common or abscess lancet. If the tumor be small, the opening • may be free, and the contained matter may at once be evacuated; but if it be of large size, and the constitutional irritation be considerable, the opening should be small, and, the matter eva- cuated very gradually, or at several successive times.—The pro- per period for performing the operation is, as soon as a fluctua- tion can be distinctly perceived, and the tumor shows a tendency to point to a particular place.—The place most advantageous, for the incision is the depending part of the swelling. MORTIFICATION. SYMPTOMS. Excessive, acute, and constant pain; great anxiety; often delirium, followed by a sudden cessation of every inflammatory symptom.—The part before tense now becomes flaccid, of a livid colour, and loses its heat and sensibility.—Vesications are formed, under which are perceived spots of a brownish hue.—The parts acquire a fetid smell, and become black.—If the event prove favourable, the mortified portion becomes completely circum- scribed; a process of ulceration is set up in the contiguous living substance, by which the dead matter is separated, and at length cast off in sloughs.—If, on the contrary, the termination be fatal, the mortification rapidly extends, great constitutional irri- tation arises, the pulse becomes small, rapid, and irregular, 2

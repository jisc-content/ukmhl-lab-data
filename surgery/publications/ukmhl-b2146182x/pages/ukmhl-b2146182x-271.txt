FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. 239 OF THE PATELLA. The patella may be fractured in two directions; longitude P a'ld tr—rselv.-In the lntter case> l|pper ^ drawn up several inches among the muscles of the thigh. treatment. rn the longitudinal fracture, continued extension of the limb : and the application of a bandage to the knee, will be sufficient ■ to effect a speedy union. In cases of transverse fracture of the patella, owing to the Sreat separation of the divided portions, it is extremely difficult, M nearly impracticable, to effect an union by bone, the parts be.ng more frequently connected to each other by the interposi- tion of a ligamentous structurc.-The fractured portions may be «nade to approach each other as nearly as appears desirable, by :the apphcation of the proper bandage.-See Plate XII. Fir 6 - The middle of a roller of considerable length is to be applied over the upper or ascending part 0f the patella; and being mrned round the thigh just above the joint, it is to be crossed under ,he ham, and again on the upper part of the tibia; an J !>av,ng thus described the figure 8 around the joint, it is to be >rope,ly secured, and daily increased in tightness. In order to maintain a perfect extension of the limb, a splint veil lined with wool, may be applied under the ham. Where the transverse fracture of the patella has united by the Wific process, the bone ha, in some instances fully recovered it, •»tural strength; but in those cases where the union is of a li- gamentous nature, the firmness and safety of the limb always emain permanently defective.

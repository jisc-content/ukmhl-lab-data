250 CALCULUS. EXPLANATION OF PLATE VIII. a. a. Erector penis. A small delicate muscle arising from the tuber ischii, and spreading its fibres over the lower part of the penis. The tendinous fibres of this muscle gra- dually blend themselves with the sheath of the crus penis. b. b. Accelerator urina;. From a middle tendinous line the fibres diverge and run obliquely upwards on each side, embracing the bulb and lower part of the corpus spon- giosum urethra?. From the muscular fibres arise tendi- nous slips, which are inserted into the crura penis. c. c. Sphincter ani, the fibres of which run in circles round the mouth of the intestine. It takes hold on the os coccygis behind, and is attached to the accelerator urinse before. d. d. The transvcrsalis perinei, which arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, and is inserted into the central point where the sphincter ani touches the accelerator urinze. c. The external hoemorrhoidal artery, which, branching upon the extremity of the rectum, and enveloped in the muscular fibres, surrounds the anus. f. The external pudical, or perineal artery, passing along the side of the bulb of the urethra, and giving twigs to the erector muscle and crus penis. g. The transvcrsalis perinei, a branch from the last-mentioned artery, is distributed to the cellular membrane, and sphincter ani muscle. h. The corpus spongiosum urethra: dissected,

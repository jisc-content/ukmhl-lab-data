CANCER OF THE BREAST. 204 —The integuments of the lower portion of the breast are now in like manner to be separated from their connexions, as is after- wards the gland itself from the subjacent pectoral muscle.— When the whole glandular part has been thus completely re- moved, the arteries are to be secured by ligature, the integu- ments brought together, and their divided edges retained in con- tact by means of the interrupted suture, or by straps of adhesive plaster; the part covered with a compress of soft linen or lint, and the dressings secured in their situation by the napkin and scapulary bandage: with which a moderate pressure should be made.—Should there be any cicatrices of the skin, that part of the integument in which they are seated should, during the ope- ration, be removed. If «a gland on the axilla has become en- larged, this, together with all the intermediate substance, ought to be extirpated. And as the arteries entering these glands are from large trunks near the heart, it is right to pass a double ligature through the mass and secure it, before they are divided, which will prevent the inconvenience and embarrassment to the operator, which their sudden retraction and consequent haemor- rhage would cause.

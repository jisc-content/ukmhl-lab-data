218 DISLOCATION OF THE SPINE. THE SPINE. DIAGNOSIS. The symptoms vary as the luxation happens to be high up, or at the inferior part of the vertebral column.—There is a total paralysis of all the parts beneath the place where the accident has happened;—there is either a suppression of mine and faxes, or they are discharged involuntarily. TREATMENT. ' The attempts for reduction will vary with the direction of the dislocation.—It is recommended to lay the patient on his face over a cylindrical body of a proper size, and in this position to endea- vour to reduce the bones to their proper situation, by slowly bending the body forwards or to one side. THE CLAVICLE. The clavicle may be dislocated either at its junction with the scapula or with the sternum. DIAGNOSIS, It is discerned by the unnatural tumor of the part;—by the shoulder falling forwards;—by the want of mobility, and by tricing the bone along its extent. TREATMENT. The arms and shoulders of the patient arc to be firmly drawn backwards, by an assistant, whilst the operator replaces the protruded end of the bone;—the stellate bandage (vide Fracture of the Clavicle) is now to be applied, and tbc arm supported by a sling.

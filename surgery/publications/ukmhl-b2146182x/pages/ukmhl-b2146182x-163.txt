EXOMPHALOS. 13S lion, by too free an exposure of the cavity. The stricture being removed, it is advised by some eminent surgeons, that no more should be done: the hernial contents freed from strangulation are not to be returned, as this disease is almost always connected with some other. Other surgeons, equally experienced, recom- mend that the intestine be returned into the abdomen, if possible, as soon as the sac is laid open, without any further dilatation of the parts, which is not to be executed till such an attempt has failed. The other species of Hernia, viz. the ventral, the obturator, the ischiatic, the labial, the cystic, and the diaphragmatic, are extremely rare in their occurrence.â€”Their treatment may be de- duced from what has been already said of Inguinal and Femoral Hernia. In books treating of hernia it is usual to mention the radi- cal cure. Several different methods have been recommended for this : they consist of obliterating the hernial sac, or that part of the orifice through which the hernia proceeds. Caustic and ligature have been tried ; and the French surgeons once propo- sed to cure hernia radically by the operation, in cases in which it was not strangulated. So far, however, as the science at present goes, no mode of radically curing this disease has been discovered, which could be adopted with propriety. The only chance of it is from the constant use of a truss.

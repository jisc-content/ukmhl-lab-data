9 TERMINATIONS OF INFLAMMATION. RESOLUTION. By resolution is meant a gradual subsidence, or going off, of all the inflammatory symptoms; the state and texture of the part remaining entire. ADHESION. Adhesion is when coagulable lymph has been thrown out from the orifices of the inflamed vessels; and by its agglutinating qualities has cemented as it were membranes, or other contiguous parts, together. When adhesion is completed, vessels shoot from the opposite surfaces, through the coagulable lymph, and anastomose, so as to completely organize the lymph, form it into cellular membrane, and at length change its properties till it assimilates with the parts which it unites. EFFUSION. This termination is peculiar to cavities lined with smooth diaphanous membranes.—The fluid effused is various, and de- pends upon the nature of the inflammation, the strength of the inrfamed vessels, and the structure of the part.—It may possess all the intermediate degrees or properties between serum, coagu- lable lymph, and pus. SCIRRHUS. Scirrhus or induration is when the inflammation leaves the part hard and swollen. ' It is a termination of inflammation more peculiar to glandular parts, which lime and stimulating applica- tions will commonly remove. SUPPURATION AND ABSCESS. SYMPTOMS. Suppuration is the process of the formation of pus.—When the suppuration is deep seated, its accession is marked by rigors, if the inflammation be considerable;—dull heavy weight of the Ii 5 i

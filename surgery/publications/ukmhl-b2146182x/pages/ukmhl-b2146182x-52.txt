34f WOUNDS OF TENDONS. TREATMENT.* The wound should be united by suture superficially inserted, as directed for wounds of the abdomen, &c.; and care should be taken, in afterwards applying adhesive straps, to leave small openings between each for the escape of air, otherwise general emphysema will ensue. Where there is great hemorrhage, immediate union by suture becomes improper.—The receding vessel should, if possible, be secured : if that be impossible, the same treatment should be adopted as to keeping open the wound, and to the posture of the patient, as in wounds of the abdomen. WOUNDS OF TENDONS. DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS. The immediate effect of a wounded or ruptured tendon, is a retraction of the divided ends to a very considerable distance frgm each other; which, when the tendon is superficial, is ge- nerally discoverable to the touch.—The rupture of a tendon is accompanied with a sudden pain or shock, similar to that pro- duced by external violence.—This is more remarkably the case in ruptures of the tendo Achillis. PROGNOSIS. When a tendon has been completely divided, the injury is seldom productive of serious consequences ; when partially so, the contrary is sometimes the case.—See Punctured Wounds, and the Consequences of Bleeding. TREATMENT, The external wound is to be united by suture ; and the di- vided portions of the tendon afterwards made to approximate. The latter is to be effected by applying compression upon the body of the .muscle, to prevent further retraction, and by so

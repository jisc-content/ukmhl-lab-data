DISLOCATION OF THE PATELLA. 224) THE PATELLA. The patella may be luxated either sideways or upwards; in which latter case, the ligament with which it is connected is torn through, and the bone is drawn up several inches among the muscles of the thigh.—The nature of the case can be distinctly ascertained, both by the sight and by manual examination. TREATMENT. In the dislocation sideways, the limb must be firmly extended ; ■when pressure being made upon the protruding edge, either directly inwards, or rather downwards, it immediately regains its former situation. The dislocation upwards is to be treated precisely as a trans- Terse fracture of the bone; which see. THE TIBIA;. The tibia may be dislocated partially, either inwards, outwards, or backwards. DIAGNOSIS. The situation of the dislocated bone is obvious to the sight. TREATMENT. Extension is to be made upwards by the femur, and down- wards by the fore-leg, while the bones arc replaced by pressure with the hand.

Internally.—The medicine almost universally employed for the cure of this disease is burnt sponge.—The mode of administering this remedy employed uy Dr. Bate of Coventry, as given by Mr. Wilmar, is as follows : The day after the moon hath been at the full, the patient is to take a vomit, and on the succeeding day a purge; on the third night, a bolus, composed of ten grains of calcined sponge ; and the like quantity of calcined cork and burnt pumice-stone is to be placed under the tongue, and being allowed to dissolve very gradually, is to be swallowed. This is to be repeated for seven successive nights, and in the forenoon of each day a powder is to be given, consisting of flowers of chamomile, gentian-root, and seeds of lesser centaury, each in powder five grains. On the eighth day the purge is to be repeated; and on the wane of the succeeding moon the same process is directed to be recom- menced, unless the disease is cured before. The vomit is only to precede the first course of the medicine. Dr. Cheston has found the following plan, which is an im- provement upon the Coventry receipt, successful in numerous cases before the structure of the part has been too morbidly de- ranged.—A dose of submuriate of mercury, one or two grains, must be given for three successive nights ; and on the following morning a purge. Every night afterwards, for three weeks, half a drachm of calcined sponge, formed into a troche with muci- lage of gum acacia, is to be put under the tongue, and allowed to dissolve gradually; when the solution is to be swallowed. At the expiration of this time the whole is to be repeated. By Mr. Prosser the following powder is recommended to be taken an hour before breakfast, for a fortnight or three weeks

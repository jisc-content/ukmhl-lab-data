51 GENERAL BLEEDING. The operation of blood-letting, so as to take blood from the System generally, is performed either by opening a vein or an artery: the former is termed Phlebotomy, the latter Arteriotomy. The situations usually chosen for a general discharge of blood from the system are four :—the fore-arm,—the neck,—the temple,—and the foot or ancle. I. IN THE FORE-ARM. The operator and patient being placed in proper relative si- tuations, which it will be needless to describe, a ligature is to be made to encircle the arm just above the elbow, so as to com- press the vein about two inches above the part from which the blood is to be drawn ; and having been suffered to remain some minutes, in order that a distention may take place from the ac- cumulated blood, the thumb of the left hand should be pressed tipon the vein made choice of (the basilic or cephalic median arc preferable—see a and f in Plate I.), about two inches below the point where the orifice is to be made. The surgeon is now to take the lancet, previously bent nearly to a right angle, between the finger ami thumb of his right hand, leaving at least half of the blade uncovered. He is then to rest, his hand on the three re- maining lingers, while he pushes the point of the instrument cautiously through the integuments into the vein; when, having thus pierced its coats, he is to carry it forwards in a direction rather oblique until an orifice of sufficient size be made, and then to withdraw it in the name cautious manner in which it entered.

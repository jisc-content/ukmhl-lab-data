THE INCISED WOUND. 21 kaanorrliage is stopped. The vessel is then cither obliterated, of the wound completely heals, according to the extent and direc- tion of the injury done to it. A haanorrhage may be stopped by simple pressure with the finger, compress, or bandage, if the Wound be slight, or the hseniorrhage trifling; hut when a considerable artery has been divided, and the effusion of blood is copious, by the application of tiie tourniquet, in situations where its use is admissible, and by afterwards securing the divided vessel with a ligature. In the application of the tourniquet, a small linen compress or cushion is to be placed over the course of the bleeding vessel, in the most eligible situation above the wound (see Amputation, where the proper positions for its application are pointed outV and secured by means of a roller passed two or three times around the limb.â€”The instrument is now to be applied with its handle in a position opposite to the compress upon the vessel, and rendered firm by the strap to which it is affixed; after which, by turning the handle, and thereby tightening tlve couipress, the hemorrhage will be restrained. The strap of the tourniquet is eommonly fastened by a buckle; which in some instances has broken, and endangered and even sacrificed the life of the patient: so melancholy an event ought not to be left to chance : the strap is more safely secured by being tied; and is recommended to be done so by some of the most eminent surgeons. The next, object is to secure the bleeding vessel j for which purpose two modes are practised : 1. by means of the tenaculum 2. by means of the crooked needle. The former is now generally preferred. The tenaculum is a curved hook, the point of which is to be passed through the coats of the divided vessel, which being pulled out beyond the surface of the wound, a ligature, com- posed of threads proportioned in number to the sine of the artery,

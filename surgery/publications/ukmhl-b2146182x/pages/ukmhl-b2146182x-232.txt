CANCER OF THE BREAST. 202 CAUSES. The usual exciting causes are, injury of the part from external violence,—inflammation, however induced. PROGNOSIS. The circumstances which lead to a prediction of the favourable event of an operation are, unimpaired constitution of the patient; —the tumor still remaining moveable beneath the integuments; —the glands of the axilla as yet unaffected;—there being no cicatrices on the skin. TREATMENT. It is recommended by Mr. Fearon, upon the supposition of cancer being induced by a previous state of inflammation, to have immediate recourse to local bleeding, gentle laxatives, and the antiphlogistic regimen, upon the first appearance of a disease of the breast after a suppression of the menses. The use of conium, as a remedy for cancer, has been perhaps too highly extolled.—The extract is usually employed, begin- ning with two grains three times a day, and gradually increasing the dose until it arrive at ten grains or more, unless it disagree. Mercury, in the early stage of the disease, has in some instances been successful—Plummer's pill, or hydrargyrus oxy-muriatus united with decoctum sarsaparilla; compositum. Arsenic;—from the concurrent testimony of many respectable authorities, no doubt can be entertained of its having been, in some instances, successful. Vide Justamond on Cancer; Rush, in American Transactions ; Simm07is, Medical Journal.—Fow- ler's arsenical solution will be the most proper form for its admi- nistration ; the dose is from four to six drops three times a day. Dr. Crawford recommends the use of a saturated solution of avuriated barytes, from four to ten drops twice a day.

MATTER IN THE STNUSES. 178 CANCER OF THE ANTRUM. This is supposed to originate in a polypus of a nature similar to that already described as occurring in the nose. It may be suspected to exist, by the chronic enlargement of the part, and by the peculiar and charasteristic cancerous pain;^-the true nature of the disease is, however, seldom ascertained, until 't has extended its ravages to the nose and neighbouring parts, and produced the most horrid deformity.—It at length terminates fatally. COLLECTIONS OF MATTER IN THE FRONTAL AND SPHENOIDAL SINUSES. SYMPTOMS. Tain and considerable swelling of the brow,—tenderness to the touch,—alteration of voice,—frequent How of tears:—after some continuance of these symptoms, a sudden gush of matter issues from the nose, and the symptoms are relieved. TREATMENT. Little can be done; the disease being out of the reach of the usual remedies.—A blister applied to the temple or forehead, and kept open with the ceratum lyttse, has been employed with sueerss.—The pain may be relieved by opium.

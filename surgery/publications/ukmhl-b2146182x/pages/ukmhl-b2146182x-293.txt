ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 26] CAUSES. It is generally the consequence of rupture of the urethra, pro- duced by obstruction of whatever nature; most frequently by str.cture.-It sometimes arises from an, abscess forming in one of the lacun* of the urethra, in consequence of gonorrhceal in- rl animation. TREATMENT. The first object will be to remove the cause of the obstruction ; without which the sinus cannot be made to fill uP.-The means of doing this are enumerated under the heads Stricture, &c. &c. Should the cause already have been removed, a staff should be introduced into the bladder, and a probe or small director be- ing passed through the external opening until it reaches the groove of the instrument, the sinus is to be dilated;- and if more than one, a communication is to be made between them. A preferable mode is, to introduce the bougie or flexible £um catheter, or common catheter invented by Mr. Smith, and to suffer it to remain in the urethra, occasionally taking it out to be cleaned; and afterwards to scarify the edges of the ulcer throughout its whole extent:—stimulating substances are to be applied to the wound, as the unguentum hydrargyri nitrico- oxydi, by which means gran dations will be formed, and the dribbling of urine soon cease. ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROSTATE GLAND Is met with only in old people; and is constituted in general, by an increase of the posterior lobe of the gland, lately de- scribed by Sir Everard Home, and which is found lying in the space separating the bladder from the vesical* seminales, ami between the two lateral lobes.

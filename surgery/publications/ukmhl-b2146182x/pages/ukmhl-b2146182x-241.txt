211 CARTILAGINOUS AND FUNGOUS SUBSTANCES WITHIN THE CAPSULAR LIGAMENTS. Small bodies arc not ^frequently formed beneath the capsular hgunenta of joints, which impede their motion, and often occa, sion much pain.—They are of two kinds. 1. Hard and cartilaginous, and loose in ti« cavity of the joint. 2. Soft, and similar to bursa; mucoie, and generally attach- ed to the cartilages. They vary in size, being sometimes as large as horse-beans, and at others there are several contained in the same joint. The first species occasion sudden and violent attach of pain, upon any motion of the limb, or upon change of posture, which go off as suddenly upon a repetition of the same cause that in- duced them.—The pain, arising from the second is constant, but less acutei CAUSES. Mr. Hunter attributed the origin of these substances to a por- tion of blood, effused by some injury which the joint might have sustained, and becoming organized by the action of contiguous parts. Mr. Russel, on Diseases of the Joints, supposes them to arise from an inspissation of synovia. TREATMENT. Many cases are related by Mr. Hey, i„ his Observations in Sundry, which were successfully treated hy the application of bandages, and by the constant use of a tight-laced knee-cap. Should this mode prove ineffectual, the body, if loose, may be amoved by an operation. This is directed by Sir Everard Home, *e Transactions of the Society for the Improvement of Mediae

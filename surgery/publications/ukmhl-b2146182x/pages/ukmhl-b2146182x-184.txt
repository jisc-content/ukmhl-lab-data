151. CATARACT* should be seated in a low chair; the operator should also be in i sitting position, but more elevated, his elhow resting upon his knee properly raised, his ring and little fingers supported upon the cheek or temple of the patient.—The upper eyelid is to be elevated by an assistant, and the lower depressed by the right hand of the surgeon; or the eye is to be fixed by means of a speculum invented for the purpose.—The couching-needle (the best construction of this instrument is that recommended by Mr. Hey—see his Observations in Surgery) is now to be en- tered, in an horizontal direction, through the sclerotic coat, a little below the axis of the eye, and about a quarter of a line beyond the transparent co'-nea, so as to get entirely behind the iris ; taking care not to wound this, by opposing to it the flat side of the instrument, if a needle of this form has been made choice of. Its point is then to be pushed forward, in a direction towards the centre of the eye (Mr. Hey) ; and, when dis- cernible through the pupil, it is to be fixed in the body of the lens, when, by elevating the handle, and thereby depressing the point, the lens, if solid, is to be pushed down by one, if fluid, by several movements, to the bottom of the vitreous ' humour.—The needle is then to be withdrawn, the eyelids closed, and covered with a soft compress moistened with a saturnine solution, or (as is recommended by Mr. Tellier) eovered with a linen bag, half filled .with fine wool, applied dry, and fixed to a circular bandage passed around the forehead. This should not be removed before the eighth day, during which time the antiphlogistic regimen should he strictly enforced. Should the lens, before absorption takes place, regain its former situation, a repetition of the operation may become ne- cessary; and may even be performed many times successively,

138 COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN. of injury to exist, it may be concluded that the symptoms arise from an extravasation of blood; the almost certain criterion of which is, in Mr. Abernethy's opinion, no blood issuing from the bone upon the removal of the pericranium;—or the bone having lost its natural appearance, and become of a whitish or dusky yellow hue.—In such casethe antiphlogistic treatment recom- mended for concussion may first be practised; and if, after a fair trial, the symptoms still continue, recourse should be had to the operation without further delay. THE OPERATION. The first step to be taken (the incision being previously made), is to remove as much of the pericranium as will be sufficient to admit the application of the trephine, at the same time endea- vouring to preserve enough to cover the perforation. This it performed by means of an instrument called the engine. The trephine, with its annexed perforator, is then to be applied, including within its circle a larger portion of the depressed than of the sound bone, and, after having made a few turns to se- cure it in its situation, the central pin or perforator* should be removed, as no longer useful, and the operator is to proceed, with great caution, to saw through the bone; using a semirotary motion with the instrument backwards and forwards, occasion- tdly brushing the accumulated particles of bone from its teeth, and often, with a probe, examining the sulcus which has been made, to ascertain if any part be already perforated. This is a part of the operation which requires great nicety;—for as the * The instrument is here, described in it$ improved state, as now actually constructed.

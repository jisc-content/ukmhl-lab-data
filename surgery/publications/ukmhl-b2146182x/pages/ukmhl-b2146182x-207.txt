COLLECTIONS OF MATTER IN THE ANTRUM OF H1GHMORE. SYMPTOMS. Pain extending upwards to the eyes, nose, and ears;—swell- ing and redness of the integuments over the part;—frequently on a sudden, and especially upon rising from bed, a discharge of matter issues from the nose, which affords a relief to the symp- toms until the cavity becomes again distended. TREATMENT. The extraction of the first molar tooth is recommended, and evacuating the matter by means of a puncture made, through the alveolus, with a stilette or sharp-pointed instrument ; and after the contents of the cavity have thus been emptied, prevent- ing the sides of the opening from closing, by means of a plug or bougie; and occasionally injecting tincture of myrrh, or some astringent Uuid. > .■)•

287 HEMATOCELE. CAUSE. Mechanical injury;—puncture;—a rupture of vessels after the sudden removal of the water in the operation for hydroceles —an atonic or relaxed state of the vessels themselves. DIAGNOSIS. The sudden appearance of the tumor;—when arising from external injury, the effect immediately following the cause;—the livid discolouration of the scrotum;—the swelling increasing' from the bottom. TREATMENT. Upon the first appearance of the tumor, astringents may b<i employed to effect an absorption of the fluid ;—should these be unsuccessful, recourse must be had to an operation, which is performed as for hydrocele by incision ;—after which, should an oozing of blood continue, tonics and astringents may be em- ployed both internally and topically ;-bark with sulphuric acid, os recommended by medical writers for the cure of passive hae- morrhages;—locally, tincture of myrrh, &c—Vide Incised ffounds. If the effusion of blood be into the body of the testicle, cas- sation will be necessary.—See Scirrhtu of the Testicle.

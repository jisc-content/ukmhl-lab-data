*1 TOISOXED WOUNDS, After the bites of rabid animals.—In order to effect this indica- tion, the first step should be the application of a tight ligature above the wound j secondly, the speedy and complete excision of the wounded part, in situations where such practice is admis- sible; and thirdly, the long-continued affusion of an alkaliue solution over the excised parts. The wound should afterwards be dressed with the unguentum cantharidis, or other stimulating ointment, in order that a discharge may be kept up for a consi- derable length of time. When, from the timidity of the patient, or from the wounded ! part being so situated as to render extirpation inadmissible, other means are obliged to be adopted; ablution with a very dilute • solution of pure potass, or the application of the nitrate of silver or pure potass, are most likely to be attended with success. Nitric acid is applied by some as the safest means of preventing the evil consequences arising from the bite of rabid animals, and destroying the poison, as it not only acts upon the parts conti- guous to the bite, but decomposes any saliva which may have been infused in the wound. It is, however, apt to spread itself 'too far over the surrounding surface. After the bite of serpents, S(c.—The most effectual means of securing the patient from future consequences, is the excision of the part, as above recommended. Where this is not prac- tised, a ligature should be instantly applied above the wounded part, and retained there while the latter is washed with the aqua kali prasparati, volatile alkali, or the spiritus ammo- nia- succinatus ;—kali purum is perhaps the best topical appli- cation. The long-continued affusion of cold water has been recom- »ended,-as also the fat of vipers;-the warm liver of a fowl

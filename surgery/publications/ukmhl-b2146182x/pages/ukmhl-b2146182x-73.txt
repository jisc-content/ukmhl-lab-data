GENERAL BLEEDING. II. IN THE NECK. The external jugular is the vein to be selected for the purpose, slid the most eligible place for performing the operation is about midway between the clavicle and the angle of the jaw. In order I to produce an accumulation of blood, it is necessary to compress the vessel on each side of the neck; and this is more conveniently done by the thumb and finger of the left hand, than by ligature and compress.—The pressure should be made about two inches below the part fixed upon for the incision.—The remaining steps in the operation are precisely similar to those above described, which need not be repeated. III. IN THE TEMPORAL ARTERY. The first step in the operation is to expose the vessel clearly to the view of the operator, by an incision made through the in,- i teguments in the direction of its course. A partial division of I the artery is then to be made transversely, or rather obliquely, when the blood will begin to flow -with great rapidity; and after a sufficient quantity has been drawn, the haemorrhage is to be slopped, either by means of a compress, secured by a bandage passed around the head, or, as is a more effectual mode, by a complete division of the vessel; the haemorrhage ceasing upon the consequent retraction of its extremities. IV. IN THE FOOT. The operation is seldom required to be performed in this situation. When it becomes necessary, the sapluena vein is to be chosen, and the same compression of the veins is requisite as above directed. To promote an accumulation and consequent flow of blood, it is usual to immerse the foot in warm water before and after the opening has been made. Adhesive plaster . will in general be sufficient to put a stop to the haemorrhage, u J

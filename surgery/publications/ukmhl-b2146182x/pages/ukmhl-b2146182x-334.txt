296 IMPERFORATE ANUS. IMPERFORATE ANUS. The anus is not unfroquently found, at birth, quite imperfo- rate, and in some instances closed simply by a thin membrane, in which case the meconium may be distinctly felt a day or two after birth, and in a manner seen shining through it. A slight puncture with a lancet, and the subsequent introduction of a bougie, will in every case be proper: but, more commonly, the imperforate anus is a melancholy occurrence, and seldom admits of remedy; the gut often terminating iii a cul-de-sac, so high up as not to be reached. In other instauces, however, it may be relieved by an OPERATION. This consists in first making a longitudinal incision in the na- tural situation of the anus (the operation being postponed as long as it safely can, that the depending part of the bowel may be distended, and pushed as low down as possible), and afterwards passing up a small trochar, in the usual direction of the bowel, until it shall have entered the extremity of the gut, and the me- conium flow from the canula. A piece of bougie is afterwards necessary to be daily introduced, until the edges of the sore be- come sufficiently callous to prevent a re-union taking place.

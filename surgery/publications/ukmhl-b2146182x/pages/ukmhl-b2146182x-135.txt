VARICOSE ANEURISM. TREATMENT. In the incipient state, compression.—In the more advanced periods of the disease, the operation just described.—Vide Aneurism. A case is related in the Medical and Physical Journal, by Dr. Adams, of an aneurism of this nature cured by pressure upon the artery above the injured part. VARICOSE ANEURISM. The varicose or venous aneurism may be considered as a combination of the two former species ; being a tumor consisting in an effusion of blood from an artery into an adjacent vein ; arising from a wound of the former, inflicted through the latter vessel.—After having attained a certain size, it frequently re- mains stationary, without alteration or increase, for years; sometimes for the remainder oi life. DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS. It is marked by a sort of tremulous motion in the vein, and by a peculiar hissing sound, occasioned by the passage of blood through a small opening,-—by the tumor being unaffected by compression of the vein below;—by its diminution or disappear- ance upon compressing the artery ; —by a more feeble-pulsation in the under part of that, than in the under part of the number of the opposite side. TREATMENT. Compression, as recommended for the incipient state of true aneurism.—Should an operation become unavoidable, it is t» he performed in the manner already described.

INGUINAL HERNIA. 126 Having thus removed the stricture, the state of the lacerated parts is to he carefully examined.—When the intestine remains sound, it is sound to the touch; the brown colour, invariably acquired under strangulation, soon lessens, or entirely disap- pears ; and the blood, when pressed from a vein, speedily re- turns. If thus free from injury, it should be immediately returned into the abdomen, carefully dissecting any adhesions that may have formed between it and the sac. If, on the con- trary, the injury it has sustained by strangulation has been so great as to have induced mortification, it will be found of a deep brown or chocolate colour, covered with a layer of brown coagu- lable lymph, fetid, and interspersed with purple or leaden- coloured spots, which readily break down under the impression of the finger. In such cases the following treatment is recom- mended : If a small portion only of the cylinder be diseased, a ligature is to be passed through the attached mesentery, at right angles with the intestine, and then through the mouth of the hernial sac ; when by this means the intestine becomes confined to the aperture, adhesions form, and an artificial anus is pro- duced. The opening has, however, in some instances, after a time, closed ; and the faces have resumed their natural course } but when the whole cylinder is mortified, the diseased part should be cut away; the divided ends brought together, and united by means of four ligatures, inserted around the intestine. Vide Wounds of the Intestines.—If the intestine has mortified, it will occasionally happen that the wind above the stricture will, .on the intestine being liberated, rush forth and force along with it a foot or more of gut, which it will be impossible at the mo- ment to return. For this purpose no exertion should be imme- diately made, fomentations should be applied to the parts, which, being supported in the hand, will very soon return.

188 ENLARGEMENT OF THE UVULA* or an instrument invented for the purpose, with a ring at its ex- tremity.—When the form of the tonsil happens to be conical, the needle invented by Mr. Chesselden will become necessary.— A double ligature being put into the eye near its point, it is to be pushed through the centre of the base of the tumor; after which the ligature should be laid hold of by a hook, pulled for- wards, and divided. -The instrument is then to be withdrawn, and the ligatures so tied, that each part may surround one half of the tumor.—To render the operation more distinct, one half of the thread may be coloured, the other suffered to remain white.—When both tonsils are affected, in general one only need be extirpated.—Should it become necessary to extirpate both, the inflammatory symptoms ensuing from the first opera- tion should be allowed to subside, before an attempt is made t» remove the remaining one. ENLARGEMENT OF THE UVULA. An enlargement of the uvula sometimes takes place, and be* comes so considerable as to give great uneasiness, by impeding deglutition, irritating the throat, and thereby causing cough, retching, and vomiting. TREATMENT. When the enlargementiis considerable, strong astringent gar- gles ; as, a solution of alum in decoction of bark. If it continue to increase in size, and become troublesome, extirpation by ligature, applied , s ..bovc mentioned; or by exci- sion, performed by means of a curved bistoury, while the tumor is held by the tenaculum.

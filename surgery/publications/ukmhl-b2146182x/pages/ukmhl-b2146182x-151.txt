125 INGUINAL HERNIA. is at the abdominal ling, it is not necessary to lay open the sac : in these cases, which must be determined by the judgment of the surgeon, the incision should be made down upon the ring, the tendon should be punctured a little above it, and a probe passed downwards through it; the tendon should then be divided by cutting out the probe.—If the tumor happen to be so turned over the ring as to make it difficult to get at it, a probe must be passed down between it and the tumor, and the finger being passed after it, the ring must be divided by a scalpel. Nothing more than this is necessary where the stricture is formed by the ring; but where the symptoms are such as to render it necessary to examine the state of the hernial contents, or where the con- striction is in the sac itself, &c. other measures are necessary, and the sac must be opened, as above directed.—In order to ascertain the seat of the stricture, the finger is to be insinuated between the intestine and the sac, and carried up to the mouth of the tumor.—It will be found in one of these situations; either at the opening into the abdomen, an inch and a half to the outer and upper side of the abdominal ring,—at the external or abdo- minal ring,—or in the sac itself, rendered preternaturally thick by the previous pressure of a truss, or constricting the contained parts by means of a septum which has been formed across it in consequence of inflammation.—In order to dilate the strictured part, the finger must now be mailt' the guide to a blunt-pointed bistoury, which is to be carefully passed up on the outside of the sac, if the stricture be in either of the two first-mentioned situa- tions, but on the inside if in the last; and having readied the desired part, an incision is to be made through the tendon, or other resisting substance, in a line directly upwards, of sufficient extent to admit of the return of the protruded parts.-See Plate* [V. and V.

25 WOUNDS OF THE CHEST. PROGNOSIS. Ill all wounds of the chest the prognosis will be unfavourable. The first species, however, is not to be esteemed a very dan- gerous wound, as numerous instances have occurred in which recovery was speedy and perfect.—The great sources of danger are, inflammation attacking contiguous vital parts, and matter or blood collecting in the cavity of the thorax. In the second species it will be extremely unfavourable; and generally fatal.—Circumstances especially indicating danger are supervening inflammation;—abscess and hectic fever; marked by rigors, colliquative sweats, diarrhoea, &c—Wounds inflicted in the perieardium, the large vessels, or the heart itself, will always be fatal.—Excessive haemorrhage ;— the patient being the subject of visceral disease, more especially of the organ wounded. —The habit otherwise depraved. TREATMENT. Of the Jir.it species.—Should the hamiorrhage be considerable, it is most likely to proceed from a divided intercostal artery ; to secure which, Mr. Latta recommends a free dilatation of the wound, and the application of a ligature. Long-continued pres- sure with the finger upon the bleeding orifice has often been suf- ficient. The wound is afterwards to be united by sutuvc ; in making which, care is to be taken that the ligatures pass through the in- teguments and muscular substance only, without penetrating the pleura. Should inflammation supervene, or blood be accumulated ii' the cavity of the chest, the treatment will be that applicable to the second species.

©UN-SHOT WOUNDS. i. If the situation of the ball, or othe^ extraneous body, can be ascertained by examination with the probe, or with the finger, recourse may be had to the forceps in order to extract it; and if these prove ineffectual, the wound should be dilated. Should the ball have run superficially beneath the integuments, it may be felt by the finger; its course may sometimes be detected by a red line in the cuticle extending from the external wound, and in this situation a simple incision will often be sufficient for its extraction. If its situation cannot be readily ascertained, little trouble need be taken upon the occasion, as numerous instances prove that balls may remain imbedded in the animal solid with- out producing injurious consequences. It has been customary to dilate all gun-shot wounds in which extraneous bodies are still lodged. Mr. Hunter objects to this indiscriminate dilatation, and lays down the following rules concerning the propriety of dilating, and the period at which the dilatation ought to be made. If the wound be slight, and extraneous bodies are lodged in it that may increase consequent irritation, it should be immediately dilated ; as also where an artery is to be secured ; where there has been a fracture, and it becomes necessary to remove detached pieces of bone, or wher- a protruded part is to be replaced :—but if the injury be severe, the dilatation should be deferred until after the first inflamma- tion is over, as by adding an incised to the contused wound, two sources of irritation would exist instead of one.

262 ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. SYMPTOMS. Sense of weight and bearing down in the perineum ;—fre- quent inclination to make water, with difficulty and pain in void- ing it;—great costiveness;—the evacuation of faeces is attended with much pain, and is in general accompanied with a discharge of urine;—micturition and dysuria increase, and at length a totaj suppression takes place. DIAGNOSIS. The urine and fsces discharged at the same time ;—the patient in making water is observed to kneel and separate his legs from each other, in order to effect a relaxation of the muscles;—an examination per rectum, when a large irregular tumor will be discovered in the situation of the prostate gland. TREATMENT. Recourse should be had to all those means which allay irri- tation in the urinary organs. Vide Calculus.—The internal use of opium,—conium,—oxymurias hydrargyri ;-the occa- sional or constant use of a catheter; which is the only effective means of giving permanent relief: it should be med from the first appearance of the disease, never suffering the bladder to be distended, as it is the pressure of the m ine upon the enlarged gland, which increases the mischiefby attention to this in the early period of the disease, it will frequently be removed. It is often very difficult to introduce the catheter, es- pecially where the enlargement is considerable; it will be neces- sary to give a curve to the instrument, sometimes till it forms nearly a semicircle, before it can pass over the tumor; which presses in upon the coats of the urethra, and lies over the nock »f the bladder almost like a valve.

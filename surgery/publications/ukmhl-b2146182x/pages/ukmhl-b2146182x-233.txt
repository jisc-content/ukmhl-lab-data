CAKCER OF THE BREAST. £03 The internal use of the plant called galium aperine, or goose- grass, is proposed by Dr. Saunders, and some cases of apparent cancer have given way to its use. ■ The ferrum ammoniacale was successfully employed by Mr. Justamond . as also the external use of a lotion, in which the tinctura ferri muriatis, and spirit of wine, were the chief ingre- dients.-From three to ten grains of the ferrum ammoniacale are to be given twice or three times a day. After a short continuance of the use of internal remedies w.thout success, it will always be advisable to have recourse to the only effectual mode of cure; i. e. extirpation of the tumor. -For this purpose, corrosive plasters of different kinds have been sometimes employed with the desired effect. Mr. Justamond used a plaster formed from yellow orpiment, previously causing ulceration of the integuments by .the applica- tion of lunar caustic; and by Dr, Moseley, an adhesive plaster, strewed with corrosive sublimate, was employed with success id several cases. From the injurious effects of such applications upon the con- stitution, it will be prudent to avoid this mode of treatment; and, while the disease is yet in its early state, to perform the fol- lowing operation : THE OPERATION. "She necessary preparations being adjusted, a semicircular in- cision is to be made across the upper portion of the breast, above the nipple ; after which the integuments are to be cautiously dis- sected away from the diseased mamma, beginning at the upper side of the wound, and proceeding to detach the tumor until the - mammary artery has been divided ; when this should be secured by ligature, before any further progress is made in the operation.

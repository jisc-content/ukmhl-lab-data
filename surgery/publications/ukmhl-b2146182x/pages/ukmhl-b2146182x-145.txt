INGUINAL HERNIA. 119 DIAGNOSIS. The distinctive marks which characterize a hernial tumor are *—distention upon coughing;—the capability, when in an hori- eontal posture, of being returned into the abdomen;—its again appearing upon resuming an erect position;—and, in scrotal hernia, its first appearing in the groin, and thence descending into the scrotum. From hydrocele.—By the latter beginning to form at tiie lower part of the scrotum, and thence gradually ascending to the ab- dominal ring:—by its.fluctuation and transparency in the one; by th j absence ot these symptoms in the other disease.—In hernia the testicle may generally be distinctly felt below the tumor; in hydrocele it is involved in the substance of the swelling, and can with difficulty be felt.—Hydrocele, until it has increased to a great size, is not dilated upon coughing. From enlarged testicle. —Vide Diseases of the Testicle. Front hematocele.—Vide Hcematocele. From varicocele.—All the marks of reducible hernia are pre- sent in varicocele.—The two diseases may thus be distinguished : "When in a recumbent position, after having returned the tumor into the abdomen, firm pressure is to be made upon the abdo- minal ring, and carefully preserved while the patient rises to an erect position, when,-if the tumor be hernia, it cannot reappear until the compressing cause is removed.—»On the- contrary, if it he varicocele, it soon returns with increased size.—The tumor in the latter disease has also an irregular ropy feel, which is not ob- .-served in hernia. TREATMENT. Sites a reduction of the tumor (which in this state t an readily be effected by the patient himself], the universal mode of pre- venting its return, is the application of a (ruts.—This is, usually, formed of steel properly covered with soft leather, and so tcm-

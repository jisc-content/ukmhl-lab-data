rHLEGMONOUS INFLAMMATION. s I. The first indication will be fulfilled by attending to the man- ner in which the inflammation was excited. To eflect the re- moval of some causes, an incision will, under certain circum- stances, become necessary; as when the inflammation has pro- ceeded from the presence of any extraneous body. ii. Tht second indication will be answered. 1. By the antiphlogistic diet. S. By rest and a relaxed position. 3. By local bleeding. The applicaton of leeches, cupping, and scarification of the part. The inflamed part itself must not however be wounded by the cupping instrument or leeches; they must be applied on the sound parts as near as convenient to it. 4. By general bleeding:—when the inflammation is so great, or in a part so important, as the eye or testicle, for instance, to render it necessary to check the arterial action in it by lowering that of the whole system, even when there is no fever. 5. By sedative and refrigerant lotions, kept constantly on the part; as the liquor acetatis plumbi dilutus, and the following :— R. Liquoris ammonia? acetatis, Spiritus camphora, aa partes aequalcs. Or, R. Acidi acetici O. j. Spiritus tenuioris O. fs. Misce. Or, R. Ammoniac muriatis §j. Acidi acetici impuri Jir. Aquae pura; § \j. Misce. a «

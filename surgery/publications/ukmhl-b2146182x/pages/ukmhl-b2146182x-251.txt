DISLOCATION OF THE WRIST. 221 the rotary motion of the arm is destroyed;—the fore-arm is so bent as to form a considerable angle with the os humeri;—and the patient is incapable of extending it. TREATMENT. Extension is to be made by assistants upwards by the humerus, and in a contrary direction downwards by the fore-arm; while the operator guides the protruded bone into its cavity.—Reduc- tion is sometimes more easily effected by making the knee the fulcrum of a lever, by which (in the dislocation backwards) the eoronoid process of the ulna may be lifted out of the cavity formed for receiving the olecranon. When the dislocation happens to be either inwards or outwards, simple extension in the directions above mentioned, with pressure of the extremity of the bone, will in general alone be sufficient. THE WRIST, The wrist may be dislocated cither inwards, outwards, or backwards. DIAGNOSIS. The sight alone is sufficient to ascertain the nature of the injury.—In the dislocation backwards, where there is generally much swelling and tension, by tracing the bones of the fore-arm, the unusual projection formed by the carpus may readily be dis- covered. TREATMENT. As the preceding dislocation. I. 3

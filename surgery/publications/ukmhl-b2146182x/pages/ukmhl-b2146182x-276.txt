COMPOUND FRACTURE. 242 COMPOUND FRACTURES. A fracture is called compound when it is accompanied with a wound in the. integuments, by which the extremities of the di- vided bone are exposed.—There is'much swelling and inflam- mation of the part; extensive suppuration ensues, with great constitutional irritation. rilOGN'OSIS Will be drawn from the extent of the injury, and from the constitution of the patient. Unfavourable circumstances are, the bone being much splin- tered;—supervening erysipelatous inflammation;—delirium;— the division of large arteries;—disposition to sloughing from ex- tensive contusion of the soft parts;—the constitution of the pa- licnt imparled by inebriety;—or by concomitant disease of the lungs, or any other important organ. TREATMENT. Any extraneous bodies which may have got into the wound, or small detached portions of bone, which, if suffered to remain, would increase the supervening inflammation, are first to be cau- tiously removed by means of a soft sponge moistened with warm water, or by the forceps.—Should there be any haemorrhage, this is to be suppressed by pressure, by the application of dossil? of lint, or bits of compressed sponge; rarely will there, be occa- sion for the use of the needle.—If the fractured extremity of the bone protrude through the wound in the integuments, it ought, if possible, to be reduced to its proper situation by manual exer- tions; but sometimes this is impracticable; in which case there will be a necessity, either for dilating the wound, or removing the protruding portion with the saw.—If the fracture be trans- verse, and the injury to the soft parts of no great extent, the former is to be preferred; but if the bone be broken obliquely

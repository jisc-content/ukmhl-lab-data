57 TOPICAL BLEEDING. The means employed for drawing bloody more immediately from particular parts consist either in the application of leeches,— in slight incisions with a lancet,—or in the use of the scarificator. THE .APPLICATION OF LEECHES. The manner in which leeches are usually applied, is so well known as not to require description.—Success is rendered more certain by previously drying them, or allowing them to crc-p over a dry cloth ; the part also, to attract them, may be moist- ened with cream, sugar, or blood; and if still not fastening, it may be cooled with a cloth dipped in cold water.—Their escape should be prevented by covering them with a small glass. SCARIFICATION AND CUPPING. This is performed, where the part will admit, by means of an instrument called the scarificator, in which a number of lancets are placed in such a manner, that when it is applied upon the affected part, the whole are, by means of a spring, pushed sud- denly into it, to a depth at which the instrument has been pre- viously regulated. A fin- scarification has been performed in the above manner', bleeding is promoted by means of glasses, from which the air has been exhausted by heat, or by an exhausting syringe.—The usual mode of applying the heat is by holding the glass over 1 lie flame of a lamp.—Another but not so neat a way is, to moisten a small piece "f tow, lint, or cotton, with spirit of wine, to set it on (ire in the bottom of the glass, and on the flame being Dearly extinguished, instantly to apply it. over the scarified part. —The glasses are to be occasionally removed, and again applied, until a sufficient quantityof blood has been drawn. n 5

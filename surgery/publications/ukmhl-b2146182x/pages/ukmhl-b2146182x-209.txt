A fissure generally in the upper lip, and sometimes extending- to the bony palate, which, by causing a preternatural projection, creates some resemblance to the lip of a hare. THE OPERATION. The deformity may in great.measure be removed by an opera- tion.—In performing it, the first step is the separation of the adhesions to the gum which usually exist at the fissured part; after which, by means of a scalpel or scissars, the edges of the opening are to be successively pierced at the upper part, and by carrying the instrument forwards along their whole extent, a thin portion of the edge is to be cut off, so that an entirely raw surface may remain, to be united by the first intention. The cheeks of the patient being brought forward by an assistant, the sides of the wound are to be accurately brought together, and rcr .taincd in their situation by means of small pins made of silver with steel points, which, when inserted, wit h their attached ligature,*, havcoblaincd the name of the twisted suture. See Plate XII. fig. 1 and 2. In the adult three pins will be required; the first should be inserted as near as possible to the red part of the lip,—the se- cond should he passed near to the upper angle of the fissure,—the. third should occupy a middle space between the two. In passing them' from one side of the fissure to the other, care should be taken that they do not completely penetrate the substance of the hi-.—In children one may be sufficient.—After the insertion of the pins, a waxed ligature is to be applied upon each, by being

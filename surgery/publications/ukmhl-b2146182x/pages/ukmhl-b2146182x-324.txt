The same ligature may be suffered to remain upon the cord, or it may be slackened, and the artery secured alone. Some surgeons cut down upon the cord, and secure it, by passing a li- gature round it before they lay bare the testicle, in order to pre- Tent their patients feeling the rest of the operation; but this . practice is dangerous, as instances have occurred of the tumor, on being opened, proving to be a rupture; and of the occur- fence of hemorrhage on the subsequent division of the cord for the removal of the testicle, from the artery being imperfectly compressed. Others dissect out the testicle from its attachments, and then examining where the cord is healthy, pass a double lb guture between the spermatic vessels and the vas deferens, and inclose the former very tightly in the one part, and the latter in the other.—The ligatures will generally come away in nine or ten days. The ligatures used for this operation should be made with great attention to their shape and neatness, that they raa* he applied with the greatest nicety and drawn very tight. After the operation, the edges of the wound are to be brought together by means of the interrupted suture, and the part being covered with a soft compress, is to be supported by the suspen- sory bag, or T bandage. HEMATOCELE. A tumor formed by an extravasation of blood in the tunica vaginalis of the testicle, or of the spermatic cord ; in the body of the testicle itself, or in the cellular membrane of the 6«rotuur. a

ANEURISM. An aneurism is a tumor formed by the yielding of the coats of on artery ; containing blood, and having a pulsatory motion.— The observations and experiments of Mr. Hunter and SirEverard Home have proved the fallacy of Haller's doctrine, who ascribed <his yielding solely to a weakness of that particular portion of the vessel which formed the tumor; they have shown that aneurism arises from a diseased state of the coats of an artery inducing a preternatural dilatation : this diseased state is most probably a tendency to form bone, as the iuterual coat of the artery is al- ways thickened and opaque, and frequently ossified, and as the disease is most commonly met with in elderly people. It may occur in any part of the arterial system; but it is most fre- quently met with in the ham, the thigh, about half way between the bifurcation of the aorta and the renal vessels, at the curvature of the same vessel in the chest, in the neck, sometimes in the arm, and in the groin.

CATARACT. 155 H 6 not only with impunity, bat with ultimate success.—Vide Hey'u Observations in Surgery. EXTRACTION. The patient and operator being placed, and the eye fixed, as for couching, the point of the cornea knife (the blade of this is formed like a spear-pointed lancet,—on one edge it is sharp throughout its whole extent, on the other only for a short *pace from its point), with the cutting edge downwards, is to be passed into the transparent cornea, at about one twelfth of an inch from the opaque, and as high as the centre of the pupil; it is then to be carried forwards to the point opposite to that at which it entered ; this being pierced, it should be again pushed cn, until, by its increasing breadth, the outer angle of the transparent cornea has been completely divided, and a semi- lunar flap has been consequently formed. A small needle, in- vented for the purpose, with a book at its extremity, is now to be introduced beneath the flap, to be passed cautiously through the pupil, and with it an opening Is to be formed in the capsule of the lens, by gentle and repeated scratches, with its curved point. This being done, the eye is to be shaded, to allow the pupil to dilate as much as possible; after which, upon gentle pressure being made upon the eyeball, at either the upper or under edge of the orbit, the crystalline lens will pass out through the opening made in the cornea. When the cataract does not come out entire, or where it is found to adhere to contiguous paiLs, the small scoop should be introduced, to remove any detached pieces, or adhesions, that may be present. When the opacity is solely in the capsule, some practitioners Itttempt to extract first the lens, and then the capsule, by the forceps or tenaculum; others the lens and capsule entire; de--

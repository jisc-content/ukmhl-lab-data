DISTORTIONS. Distortions cither in the form or position of parts occasionally arise; they may depend on one or other of the following cir- cumstances : i. Congenital deformity in the figure of a bone. II. Permanent muscular contraction. in. Disease, connected with caries and destruction of bone., iv. Mollities ossium. The bones are very rarely found changed from their proper shape in the foetal state. By far the most frequent kind of dis- tortion is that In which one or both feet are defective, generally turning inward and upward; and even in these cases the com- plaint is derived only from the muscular parts having been set and adapted to the peculiar position of the limbs in utero. Distortion from caries is generally observed to take place in the bones of the spine, and occurs most commonly in early youth; whereas mollities ossium is an affection of bone peculiar to the adult age. â€¢treatment. When in infancy the bones of the limbs have any unnatural iurvature, very little can be expected from the aid of instru- ments ; for the surrounding parts are yet too soft to admit of any material degree of pressure being made, and even the operation of such pressure, were it established, might prove injurious du- ring the incipient advances of ossification. Where tlie tarsal or metatarsal cartilages are malformed, the event will tit generally unfortunate, notwithstanding every me- shanical assistance that can be afforded. The most frequent

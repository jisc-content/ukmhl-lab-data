STRICTURE IN THE URETHRA. 271 N 4 thizcs, nausea, frequent retching, rigors, considerable exacer- bations of fever, and a long train of miseries afflict him. The stricture then sometimes inflames, or mortifies, or ulcerates, or suppurating, causes abscess in the corpus spongiosum, or pe- rineum, &c. Occasionally the bladder partakes of the inflam- mation ; coagulable lymph may then be thrown out, which, fill- ing up its cavity, destroys the patient by the most dreadful sufferings. ** Stricture never occurs after fifty years of age. It is a disease of youth, as the disease of the prostate gland is of old age. CAUSE. Preceding inflammation or ulceration, by whatever cause induced. TREATMENT. The cure of strictures is to be effected either by the dilatation or the destruction of the diseased parts. The first is to be at- tempted by a common bougie, the second may be accomplished by the assistance of caustic. When the stricture does not obli- terate more than half the circumference of the urethra, whilst the parts are contracted, aiid their structure unaltered, the former indication may be fulfilled; but in more advanced cases the at- tempt cannot succeed. A bougie, of the full size of the canal, should first be tried, as it will often pass into the bladder, when' a smaller would be prevented, either by the stricture being the result of spasm and irritability of the membrane, or by the smaller one getting entangled in the laennre on the lower surface of the urethra. The bougie may be passed daily, unless particu- lar circumstance, prevent. Some surgeons prefer the metallic bougies, made by Mr. $Ml&, and recommend that they should be retained half afl hour and upwards in the urethra; whilst others, Sir Evcrard Home especially, deprecate the use of the metallic

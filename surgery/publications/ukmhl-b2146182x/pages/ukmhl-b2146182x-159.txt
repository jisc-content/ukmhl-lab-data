129 FEMORAL OR CRURAL HERNIA. HERNIA CONGENITA. Hernia congenita is a protrusion of some of the contents of the abdomen into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis of the testis ; owing to the want of the customary adhesion between its sides, after the descent of the testicle in early life.—It is more frequent- ly seen in children, soon after birth.— It is distinguished from bubonocele by the testicle not being distinctly felt at the bottom of this tumor;—and from hydrocele of the spermatic cord, for which it is often mistaken, by pressure made upon the abdo- minal ring, after the swelling has receded in the recumbent posture, preventing its return, upon rising to the erect position. Vide Diagnosis of Bubonocele. In hernia congenita, previous to the application of a truss, it will be expedient carefully to ascertain, by examination, if the testes have already descended into the scrotum.—Should this not be the case, a truss ought never to be applied, as it would en- tirely prevent the descent of the testicle, which yet remains in the abdomen. FEMORAL OR CRURAL HERNIA. The seat of femoral hernia is the upper and fore part of tho thigh, the protruded bowels passing out at the same opening though which the large blood-vessels arc transmitted to the thigh; and consequently under the crural arch, or Fallopius's ligament. It is most commonly met with in women. The tumor, though sometimes situated immediately over the femoral vessels, is very generally on their inner side; for in the internal and lateral parts of the sheath in which they are en- closed, and close to the branch of the os pubis, " precisely where G 5

gjQ VERRUCA, Should there be great pain or irritation, the loeal application of opium, in form of lotion, or added to the unguentum hvdrar- gyri, maybe useful; but the ulcers do best with dressing* of the solutions of nitrate of silver, of Bate's water, &c. Unctuous applications arc very seldom advisable. Eruptions require from ten to fourteen ounces of ointment; they are frequently very obstinate :-the best proof of their beurg effectually cured is the site of them becoming white aad de- pressed. VERRUC7E Are small hard tumors of the skin, covered with a thiclv jagged cuticle, and of different shapes; they appear on the pre- puce and glans penis in men, and on the labia pudendi, and upper and inside of the thigh in women. They are frequently venereal. Condylomata are excrescences, also often venereal, ansmg ahoutthe anus and perineum; they are sometimes very large, and discharge an offensive ichor. TREATMENT. Warts will not disappear on the internal use of mercury : con- dylomata sometimes will, without local applications â–  its use, 08 directed above, is requisite, howwer, when they arise from vene- teal taint. Warts, when pensile, are best removed by ligature; but they may be cut off with scissars, or destroyed by the nitrate of silver or caustic potass. Fumigations, mineral acids, unguentum sa- hiivje, &c. are used by some practitioners.

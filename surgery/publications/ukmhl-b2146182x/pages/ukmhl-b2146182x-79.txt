SETON". 59 When the lancet is chosen, the parts arc to be previously pinched up with the finger and thumb, and then cut through until an opening of sufficient size has been formed. The following is the best mode of applying caustic.—The part is first to be covered with a piece of adhesive plaster, in the centre of which a circular hole has been cut of the size of the intended issue;—in this hole the caustic, potassa fusa, made into a paste with soap, is to be placed : the whole is then to be covered with another plaster, secured by a bandage, and suffer- ed to remain for ten or twelve hours. In two or three days gene- rally an escar begins to separate, when the opening should be filled with the substance made choice of; this may either be a pea, a bean, small pieces of orris or gentian root, orange- peas, &c. THE SETON. The seton i» made by means of a needle invented for that purpose, with an attached skein of cotton or silk : in inserting it, tiie parts at which it is to enter and pass out are to be previously marked, and a small part of the skein smeared with some mild unguent. After which the needle is to be passed completely through, and then separated from the cord, which should be suffered to remain within the wound, its ends hanging from the edges. Small pieces of Indian rubber are now prepared for setons in- stead of ski-ins of silk or thread : they are bent at each end, to prevent them slipping out.—The seton should be dressed daily with a mild unguent; and if the discharge should cease, it may he st.niulated with the ceratum lyttic,— unguentum hydrargyri nitrico-oxydi—or unguentum sabime. d G

49 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. Locally.—The application of leeches.—The old practice of scarifying the contused edges of the wound has lately been re- newed on the continent, it is said, with success.—Turpentine,— dilute solution of nitric acid,—have also been advantageously employed.—Hot fomentations ; and, if the inflammation be §reat, fomentations of poppies and hemlock.—Warm cataplasms often repeated ; but in the greater number of cases the most simple applications are the best. After suppuration has taken place, Peruvian bark and other tonics ;—opium in large doses;—the local use of a dilute solu- tion of nitr ic acid. Where the injury has been so extensive as to require amputa- tion, much dispute has taken place concerning the period proper for performing it. A state of high health is by no means the most calculated to endure withtsuccess an important operation, and ex- perience teaches us to M^ve the performance of amputation till the first inflammation hasjjsubsidcd, unless, from the greatness of the injury, it may be exfected to destroy the patient. This oc- curs more frequently in Jvounds from gun-shot, than in those produced by other causifi. The proportion of those who re- cover, after suffering amputation on the field of battle, is small compared with those who die ; and this is a truth more espe- cially evinced in sieges, where wounds are mostly inflicted by shells or cannon-shot, and where the consequent and immediate necessity for removing the stricken limb is very frequent. Oa the contrary, there is a much better chance of I lie patient doing well, who has been previously lowered by inflammation and symptomatic fever. The circumstances instantly demanding the operation, are, greal injuries done to the larger joints;—such destruction of the soft parts as to destroy the circulation of the blood ; — the partial

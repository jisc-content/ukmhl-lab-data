CATARACT. 153 begins uniformly over the whole surface, the loss of visicn is more complete; — it is of a shining white colour, approaches nearer to the iris, and even presses forward into the pupil; the spots often change their position, and upon opening the cornea the pupil does not contract. The connate cataract is mostly in a dissolved state. The cataract produced by an opacity of the capsule of the lens is distinguished by its peculiar shining surface, and by the ap- pearance of silver-like lines, forming radii or stars. In fluid cataracts the capsule is also usually opaque. TREATMENT. In the incipient state—mercury, particularly the submuriaU, or oxy-muriate, in small doses. Electricity, in the form of aura, or weak sparks. Hj'oscyamus has been highly extolled. When any degree of inflammation is present, local bleeding, and the antiphlogistic regimen. After these remedies have been employed without success, the, cure must depend upon a surgical operation. For performing this, two methods are in general use, each of which has its ad- locates. The first of these is called couching; the second is termed extraction. COUCHING. To guard as much as possible against the effects of inflam- mation, the patient should be confined for several days previous to the operation to a low regimen;—if plethoric, lie should be. bled, and two or three doses of some cooling laxative should he administered after proper intervals.—These and other ncce< sary preparations being made, the patient should be so placed, that light may fall upon the eye in one direction only}—hfl H 5

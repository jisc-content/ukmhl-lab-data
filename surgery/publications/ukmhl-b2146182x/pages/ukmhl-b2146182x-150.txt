124 INGUINAL HERNIA. Fomentations arc inferior to cold applications; yet where tbe tumor is extremely tense, and the scrotum much inflamed, to- gether with leeches, they have been successfully employed. If these means fail, the only resource is in an operation for the liberation of the confined parts ; the success of which espe- cially depends upon its being performed early. When the in- flammatory symptoms are violent, and the above remedies have failed, it should be performed although the strangulation has only existed a few hours. There is more hazard in the delay than in the operation. THE OI-ERATION'. The patient being commodiously laid, the hair removed from the parts, and other necessary preparations made, the tumor is to be-firmly grasped with the left hand, while an incision is made (if it be not extremely large) through the integuments, along its whole extent. By this the skin and cellular substance will be divided, and a thin fascia exposed, which is given ofi' by the ex- ternal oblique muscle.—Through the middle of this a small opening is then to be made, for the introduction of a director, by the assistance of which it is to be dilated upward to within one inch of the abdominal ring, and in a similar manner down- wards to the bottom of the tumor.—The second covering of the sac, or the cremaster muscle, next comes in sight, and this being divided precisely as the preceding fascia, the sac itself is exposed to view.—The anterior and inferior portion of the sac is now to be pinched up between the fingers, and being thereby separated from its contents, a small bole is to be made into It. in on hori- zontal direction; after which it is to be carefully dilated in the same manner as the preceding tunics. The next step is to remove the stricture.—Where there is rea- son to believe that the intestine is butlittlc inflamed, where the symptoms are chiefly those of obstruction only, and the stricture

272 STRICTURE IN THE URETHRA. bougie, using the common ones, and also assert, that more rapid advances are made in the dilatation of the stricture by withdraw- ing the bougie in a few minutes, than by the other practice- Previous to the introduction of the bougie, it should be slightly curved, and covered with bland oil, or unguent, to prevent ir- ritation.—It ought to be worn at first about half an hour, gra- dually extending the time from day to day.—The size should be increased as the resistance to its passage becomes diminished.— In very bad strictures, catgut bougies are to be preferred. In those cases where a bougie, even of the smallest size, can- not be passed, as likewise in those which are of such long stand- ing as to preclude the hope of a recovery from its use, recourse is to be had to the application of caustics.—For this purpose a piece of lunar caustic is to be securely inserted into the extremity of a common bougie, and secured from irritating the urethra, by being so enclosed as not to project beyond the extremity of the instrument; being surrounded every where laterally by its sub- stance.—A common bougie is now to dilate the canal of the ure- thra, to ascertain the degree of the stricture, and to measure its exact distance from the external orifice : this distance being marked upon the armed bougie, it is to be immediately carried down to the contracted part, and its extremity suffered to remain there, with a slight degree of pressure, for the space of about half a minute, and then to be withdrawn.—This is to be repeated ..every second day; and if there be more than one stricture, they may thus be removed in succession.—It will always be proper to let the effects of one application of the caustic go off, before it is again passed to the stricture, even should it be a week or longer before the parts are tranquil. Care must be taken also, that the armed bougie be large enough entirely to destroy the whole faco

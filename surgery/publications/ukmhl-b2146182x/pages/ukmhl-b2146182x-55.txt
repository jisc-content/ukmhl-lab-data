PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 37 and in general the nearest gland becomes enlarged, great con- stitutional irritation ensues, the pulse is extremely quick and hard ; delirium, and in some instances death, has followed. The most frequent consequence, however, of bad punctured wounds, is deep-seated inflammation, followed by abscesses; which at all times produce considerable inconvenience, and sometimes even tremendous symptoms of irritation, especially when these collections of matter are confined by the fascia or aponeurotic expansion of muscles. Punctured wounds will sometimes unite by the first intention, without much pain, or concomitant inflammation; this there- fore in their treatment should always be remembered and at- tempted; the orifice of the stab should be closed by ships of plaster, over which cold should be applied. Quiet, and the an- tiphlogistic regimen, must also be strictly observed. TREATMENT. It has been recommended as the most effectual way of pre- venting ill consequences from stabs, to enlarge the opening with a lancet or scalpel, and thus convert the puncture into a simple incision, to be united by the first intention. This can only be practised in very superficial punctures, in which the infliction of such pain would generally be a very wanton and unnecessary procedure. When the inflammation is not considerable, compression by bandages should be had recourse to, in order to facilitate an union between the sides of the wound. When, however, the inflam- matory symptoms arc running high, and will not yield to the attempts to restrain them, suppuration must be promoted; and little more than this can be done, for the most part, in cases of deep stabs, as the local and general symptoms of irritation are

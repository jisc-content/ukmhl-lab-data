FRACTURE OF THE FIBULA. 241 EXPLANATION OF PLATE VII. Show s the mode of securing a fractured leg, by laying the limb in junks. In this method, two Ion:,' rolls of straw, or pieces of broom- stick, rolled up in the opposite ends of a sheet, until they nearly meet in the middle, are placed upon a large pillow; the fractured limb, previously secured in the usual way with its splints, being laid in the vacant space, and the whole apparatus brought toge- ther by long tapes, tied sufficiently tight to render the whole limb firm and steady, without creating any unpleasant sense of stricture; the support of a foot-board maybe added, if neces- sary. The pillows are to be secured by a proper application of tapes. THE FIBULA ALONE. A fracture of the fibula generally happens from two to three inches above the ancle-joint, which is always dislocated.—The foot is so much turned outwards as to form a considerable angle at the fractured part.—Upon moving the joint a crepitus is to b<r observed. TREATMENT. Splints are to be applied, and the limb treated as for a fracture of both bones; with the exception of a roller, which is to be sub- stituted in the place of the usual bandage.—It should at first be loosely applied, but afterwards gradually tightened and extended to the foot.

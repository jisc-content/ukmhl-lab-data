CALCULUS. 21/? m 4 Some calculi arc acted upon by alkalis, others by acids. For tlie composition of calculi consult Wbllastdn in Philosophical Transactions. Mr. Jesse Foot recommends lime-water by (he use of the vesica lotura.—Sec Foot on (he Petite Ledum. Seltzer, Uuxton, and Malvern waters. III. Previously to determining on an operation, the actual exist- ence of a calculus in the bladder is to be well ascertained by the introduction of an instrument called a sound.—This is perform- ed precisely as the introduction of the common catheter; and if no cause of deception be present, the percussion of the instru- ment against the stone will give a vibrating sensation to the fin- ger at once decisive: in general the sound is distinguishable also by the ear. There will frequently be a troublesome opposition to the passage of the sound cither at about five inches and a half up the urethra from the orifice, or at about one inch from the neck of the bladder, caused by a spasm of the inner coat of that canal.—This sometimes may confuse the surgeon, who may, from repeated failure, be led to ascribe the first to stricture, and the second to diseased prostate gland :—in such cases per- severance will mostly succeed. If the sound will not pass, a bougie, or, what is better, an elastic gum catheter, properly curved, is recommended: the latter should be introduced when flic bladder is distended with urifle, which flowing off, the Stone is pressed forward, and felt rasping its rough surface against the end of the instrument. The presence of the stone being ascertained, the patient, if of a plethoric habit, should, on the day preceding tliat determined upon for the operation, lose a moderate quantity of blood; an aperient

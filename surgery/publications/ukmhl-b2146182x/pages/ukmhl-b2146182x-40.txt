22 THE IKCISED WOUND. previously waxed, and loosely slipped over the instrument in w manner of a ring, is to be drawn by an assistant over its po.nl, until it encircle the extremity of the vessel, when its ends are to be gradually, yet firmly, drawn, so that the sides of the latter may be effectually compressed. It is then to be secured by • •econd knot, one thread of the ligature should be cut off, within a quarter of an inch of the vessel, and the other is to bo left hanging from the wound: when both the threads are left, too much irritation is frequently produced, especially where it is necessary to take up many vessels; and the ends being cut off at a proper distance, are to be suffered to hang from the wound. When, however, from the depth of the wound, or from the artery having retracted beyond the reach of the tenaculum, there is a necessity for using the crooked needle; this armed with a proportionate ligature is to be introduced at about a quarter of an inch from the situation of the vessel, to be carried under it, and brought out at the same distance on the opposite side ; and this being repeated, a knot is to be made as above directed. A constant oozing sometimes takes place from the surface of a wound, either owing to a relaxed state of the part, as indi- cated by a general relaxation and debility of habit, or from too plethoric* State of constitution.—Iu the former case astringents and balsamics have been successfully employed ; such asterebinthiua, —alkohol,—myrrh,—tinctura benzoes composita,—powdered myrrh,—galbanum,—gum acacia—In the latter—bleeding,— purging, &c. 11. The second indication is effected either by the forceps or probe, according to the size or situation of the extraneous bodies ; or more effectually by careful ablution with a sponge and warm water, or by the us« of the syringe.

STEATOMATOUS TUMORS. 98 pation : this consists simply in a cautious dissection of the tumor from the surrounding parts. Corns should be secured from pressure by means «f « piece of ■thick adhesive piaster, in the centre of which a hole has been made for the reception of the projecting part. This, with fre- quent immersion in warm water, and occasional paring, has ■often beeu found to remove them.—An effectual mode of extir- pation is by the application of a. ;small blister; the effect .of which will generally be to raise them with the cuticle. STEATOMATOUS TUMORS. These consist in a morbid growth of the adipose membrane: their first appearance is usually a Si_ all excrescence, soft and. cedematous; this gradually incieasing, often attains an enor- mous size.—They are free from pain and inflammation and dis- colouration of the cuticle, and occasion inconvenience to the patient only by their bulk ; sometimes, however, after they have' become extremely large, inflammation and ulceration take place. They are soft to the touch; feeling not unlike the omentum contained within a hernial sac. DIAGNOSIS. The characteristic marks are—the softness of'thcir texture;—- their great bulk;—the absence of pain and inflammation. TREATMENT. Removal, either by ligature, or by-excision : the latter mode is preferable, unless the tumor is extremely pendulous, and hangs -by a small pedicle.—The operation of excision is in general a , simple one, except in certain situations, as in the neck, where great delicacy and caution are required, to prevent doing injury to contiguout important parts ; — in performing it, sufficient in- tegument should be saved to effect a consequent union by th? first intention. 6

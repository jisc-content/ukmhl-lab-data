COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN. 139 bones of the cranium are formed by an inferior and superior table, divided by diploe, the fracture of the inferior may not correspond with that of the superior table; and if this is not held in mind, the trepan may be doing irremediable mischief as. • soon as it has penetrated the superior table; for although the dura mater may with impunity be wounded by a sharp instrument, or has recovered, when torn by a musket-ball, which has also entered the brain, it does not seem to have the same power, when it alone is lacerated by a blunt instrument, for such injury is invariably mortal.—When any part is sawn through, great and redoubled caution must be used, and the instrument should be made to bear upon the unperforated parts, until the bone he- comes sufficiently loose to be removed with the forceps or ele- vator. The parts beneath the cranium being now exposed to view, if the replacement of a depressed piece of bone be the object of the operation, it is to be effected by means of an instrument called the elevator. This acts as a lever, the fulcrum to which should be either the sound portion of bone, or the finger laid over it.—Should an accumulation of blood have given rise to the symptoms, the fluid will now, if situated between the dura mater "and the bone, have a free exit; if it be collected beneath the dura mater, that membrane will be found tense, dark- •oloured, or oven livid. In this case an opening becomes ne- cessary. This should be performed by making gentle scratches or incisions with a scalpel, until a director can be introduced} upon which the membrane should be sufficiently divided to, afford an outlet to the fluid. If, after the operation, any points of bone remain attached to the sides of the orifice, these should be carefully separated by the forceps or the elevator.

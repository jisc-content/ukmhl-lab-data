A wound inflicted by a cutting instrument; and in which there is a simple division of the part, without any, or any con- siderable, loss of substance.—The usual and immediate con- sequences are,—a greater or less retraction of the divided parts, according to the texture of the particular portion of the body which is the seat of the accident; and a discharge of blood pro. portioned in quantity to the size of the injured vessels. PROGRESS OF SPONTANEOUS UNION. By the first intention.—When the edges have separated only to a certain distance, or still remain in apposition, a portion of blood is thrown out from the incised orifices of the arteries, by which the chasm is filled.—The lips of the wound become, tumid and painful, a slight inflammation ensues, under which vessels shoot into the inorganized coagulum—This soon becomes endued with life, and thus a complete union is effected. By granulations.—When, however, from the nature of the part, or from other causes, the edges have retracted to a consider- able extent, union by the first intention is prevented from taking place; suppuration supervenes; pus is formed; granulations arise, and, increasing, fill up the cavity; and, having attained the surface, by a power inherent in them, they contract towards

THE GANGLION. 100 The cmplastrum cumini ;—the emplastrum ladani compositura, .and galbani compositura. Electricity;—dry cupping ;—salt brine j—diluted volatile spirit. It has also been customary to evacuate the matter by seton ; but the most effectual mode of removal, and that now usually practised, is extirpation with the knife.—In performing this, the cyst, still containing the matter, is to be carefully dissected from the surrounding muscular and cellular substance, and suf- ficient integument is to be saved to effect an union by the first intention. GANGLION. A ganglion is a tumor formed by a preternatural collection I of fluid within the vagina of a tendon or a bursa mucosa.—It is - situated under or between tendons, and generally near to a joint. —It begins with a small, moveable, elastic swelling, attended with little or no pain or discolouration of the cuticle.—It sel- dom attains a large size, and in general shows no sign of in- flammation ; yet sometimes an inflammation supervenes, when: adhesions not unfrequently take place among the tendons, by I which their uiot'ons are often impeded, and the joint rendered useless. TREATMENT. The removal of the tumor may first be attempted by means l of pressure; for this purpose the'application of sheet-lead has) most frequently proved effectual.—Stimulant applications also sometimes produce an absorption of the fluid; of these the best are—mercury, applied by friction, —blisters,—a solution i Of muriate Of ammonia,—electricity.—If these prove unsuccess- ful, the collected Quid may be evacuated by a small opening : made with the point of a lancet.—After the contents have been J thus let out, the orifice should be immediately closed, and |

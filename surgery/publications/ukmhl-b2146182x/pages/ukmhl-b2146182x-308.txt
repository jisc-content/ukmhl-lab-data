274- PARAPHIMOSIS. against the belly. Before inflammation has come on, injections of Bate's water, or weak solutions of caustics, are successful. In obstinate cases, injections of corrosive sublimate in lime-water, three or four times a day, or mercurial ointment introduced under the prepuce by a pencil-brush, will often cure where every thing else has failed. If, after inflammation has been by these means removed, reduction by manual efforts still continues impracticable, an ope- ration is to be performed for the removal of the disease. This is done by means of a sharp-pointed knife concealed in a grooved director, which should be insinuated between the prepuce and the glans, until it has reached the corona glandis, when the knife should be pushed forwards, and the prepuce divided at the dor- sum : the wound is afterwards to be dressed with simple dress- ings. Circumcision is now often preferred to the merely slit- ting the prepuce, particularly in cases which are connate.—In this, the elongated prepuce is to be drawn forward, and the glans penis being defended, a bistoury is to be passed through it, and it is to be cut off: the remaining part is then to be slit up with a pair of scissars, as far as the corona glandis, and the small flaps are to be turned behind the glans, where they will soon heal, and little or no skin will be left to annoy the patient. PARAPHIMOSIS. Paraphymosis is a retraction and swelling of the prepuce, so as to produce a stricture behind the glans penis.—It is generally accompanied with much swelling and inflammation of the penis, which has in many instances terminated in mortification. CAUSES. It is induced by the same causes as the preceding disease.

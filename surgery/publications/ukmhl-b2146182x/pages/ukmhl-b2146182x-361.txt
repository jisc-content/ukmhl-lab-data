AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. 321 AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. The best method for performing this operation is the fol- lowing. The patient being placed in a good light, and conve- niently for the operator, the subclavian artery is to be secured where it passes over the first rib, by the pressure of a firm com- press in the hands of an assistant. The first incision is brought from the point of the acromion process forwards and downwards, and is carried deep down, through the flesh, the muscular arteries of which must be im- mediately secured by ligature. (See Plate XII. fig. 6.) The second incision is a counterpart to the first; it is earned backwards round the limb, and terminates by the dividing the tendon of the pectoral muscle : here again the large arteries that occur must be taken up. The capsule of the joint is next to be divided, and the head of the humerus turned out from its socket. The limb is then to be entirely removed; and the axillary artery somewhat separated from the surrounding nerves, brought forward with a tena- culum, and securely tied with a strong ligature; when the flaps being brought together, and supported by the proper band- ages, the operation is finished. r ft

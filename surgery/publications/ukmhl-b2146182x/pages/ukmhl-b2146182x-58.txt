In the greater number of cases the bad symptoms come on in fourteen or sixteen hours after the bite, which in this country seldom proves fatal. Its fatality is said to be proportioned to the smallness of the animal bitten. Of the bite of the rattlesnake.—Rapid depression of strength, rigors, nausea,—swelling of the part, livid spots appearing on the course of the absorbents, increasing to sphacelation of the cellular membrane, and integuments of the whole limb.—A full, strong, agitated pulse,—swelling of the whole body,—the eyes much diffused with blood,—sometimes copious bloody sweats,— and often haemorrhages from the eyes, nose, and ears.—The teeth chatter, and the pains and groans of the sufferer indicate his approaching dissolution. The bite of the adder is attended with symptoms of a similar nature, but they are much less violent; neither does it often prove fatal. Of smaller reptiles, and of insects.—These in general produce local inflammation only; which, however, is often very severe : in some instances the bite is productive of the same consequences as punctured wounds; inducing inflammation of the absorbents, and convulsions from their action on the nerves. The effects of the bite of musquittos, are small tumors, at- tended with so high a degree of itching and inflammation, that the patient cannot refrain from scratching; by a frequent re- petition of which he not uncommonly occasions them to ul- cerate.

Excrescences are sometimes formed about the anus, which, from their figure, obtain the name of fici, aristee, &c. They sometimes grow within the gut itself, but are oftener situated at the verge of the anus.—They vary in size, from that of ordinary warts to that of split garden-beans.—They are also various in colour, figure, and consistence.—Sometimes there is only one or two ; generally, however, all the skin around the anus becomes covered with them. TREATMENT. When they are soft, gentle escharotics will destroy them, as the muriate of ammonia or pulvis sabinse;—the application of tinctura ferri muriati, by means of a camel-hair pencil. The harder kinds are to be removed by nitrate of silver, by ligature, tir by excision.

INGUINAL HERNIA. 121 made upon the part, which not only prevents a further protru- sion, but has in some instances produced an absorption of the adipose substance, and ultimately a reduction of the tumor.—In some cases supposed to be irreducible, the application of ice— vide Treatment of Strangulated Hernia—by contracting the scrotum, has caused a return of the protruded parts. When the bulk of these parts has been increased by fat, which is often the case in the omentum, and sometimes in the intestines, the confining the patient to his bed, and keeping him on a spare diet for a fortnight or three weeks, will very probably succeed. If it be an irreducible epiplocelc, a steel truss may be applied; for al- though the intestines will suffer by the slightest pressure, the omentum will not. The spring of the truss not being very tight, * a moderate degree of pressure should be made on the omentum, by which adhesion will be produced between it and the sides of the sac, and thus a further protrusion will be prevented. Should sickness or colic come on, the truss should be immediately re- moved, as some fold of intestine is then contained in the sac, which may possibly be only occasionally down : the truss should, therefore, be again tried, and applied before the patient rises from bis bed. HI. In the strangulated state. In the strangulated state of hernia there is such a compression ol' the blood-vessels, as to excite inflammation, and interrupt the passage of the feces through the descended portion. SYMITOMS. Sense of stricture at the upper part of the abdomen, or at tin- navel ;—frequent eructations j— vomiting of a bilious, and some- times of a feculent matter; obstinate constipation ;—quick, hard pulse.—The tumor is red, painful, and cedematous ;—the

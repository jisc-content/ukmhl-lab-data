These preparatory steps having been taken, the patient is to be laid upon a table considerably higher than is usual for other operations;—his thighs are to be drawn up to the abdomen, and the ancles and wrists of each side firmly bound together, by means of a noose formed in a piece of strong tape.—The thighs, should then be separated from each other, and the nates being made to project a little over the edge of the table, the surgeon is to commence his operation. He is first to introduce a grooved staff of proportionable size into the urethra and bladder. This is generally the most diffi- cult part of the operation, in consequence of the irritation caused; by the sharp edges of the groove ; no force, however, must b» used; the surgeon must wait till the spasm has ceased, and then passing his finger into the rectum, endeavour to direct the instrument, and prevent its being entangled in the membranous- part of the canal. The staff having entered the bladder, he must now feel the stone before he proceeds j then inclining the groove of it to the perineum, deliver the handle to an assistant, who is carefully to preserve it in that position. An incision is now to be made on the left side of the raphe of the perineum with a common scalpel, beginning immediately below the symphysis pubis, and continuing it obliquely down- wards and outwards, to about opposite the middle of the sphinc- ter ani muscle. By this the muscles of the perineum will be ex- posed,—A second incision is to be made between the bulb of the urethra and cms of the penis, at the same time drawing

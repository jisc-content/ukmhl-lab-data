calculus. 249 M 5 aside the former with the fore-finger of the left hand. The transversa perinei, and a few fibres of the sphincter ani, will now have been divided, and the membranous part of the urethra and prostate gland will be exposed.—The third incision will be through the membranous part of the urethra into the groove of the staff.—See Plate VIII. The next step in the operation is the introduction of the gor- get; and the knife may serve as a guide to the passage of rts beak into the groove: after which the operator is to take the staff from the assistant, and drawing it gently towards him, the gnrgct is to be pushed forwards, in an horizontal direction, until it has entered the bladder; the criterion of which is, the flow of water which then takes place, and the necessary percus- sion of the one instrument against the other.—See Tlate IX. The staff is now to be withdrawn, and the forceps pa^rd along the groove of the gorget into the bladder; the gorget is to be taken away, and then the forceps must be cautiously moved about in different directions, until, by striking against the stone, the situation of this is discovered; when the blades are to be separated, and the stone grasped in the most favourable position, which may in great measure be ascertained by the greater or less degree of expansion of the handles.—It should then be extract- ed in a slow and cautious manner, directing part of the extract- ing force downwards on the perineum, that it may with greater facility pass under the arch of the pubes. Should the stone be too large to pass the angle formed by the rami of the ischia, it is to be broken down by a pair of strong forceps usually made for this purpose, and each portion carefully removed by means of an instrument called the scoop, and by tepid injections,

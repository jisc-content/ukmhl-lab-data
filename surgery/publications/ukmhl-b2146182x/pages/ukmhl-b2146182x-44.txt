26 SUPERFICIAL WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. Of tlie second species.—After the suppression of the haemor- rhage, the chief object is to prevent inflammation supervening, —by copions and repeated bleedings,—purging,—a strict anti- phlogistic regimen, and other means recommended for the treat- ment of inflammation.—See Inflammation. The union of the wound should not at first be attempted ; but being simply covered with a compress of lint, the patient should be laid in such a position that it may be in the most depend- ent part of the thorax.—Any blood which would otherwise be collected in the cavity of the chest will thus be evacuated at the external wound.—After the expiration of twelve hours it may be closed as above directed. Should an accumulation of blood or matter take place in a few days after the healing of the external wound, which is not an unfrequent circumstance, and is marked by—extreme diffi- culty of breathing,—sense of weight and immense oppression at the chest,—purple flush of the countenance,—difficulty of lying upon the opposite side,—the operation for empyema should be performed, and the collected fluid evacuated.—Sec Empyema. If emphysema be present, small punctures should be made at different places in the tumefied part. SUPERFICIAL WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. Wounds in which the integuments of the abdomen have been divided without injury to the contained viscera. They are dangerous, or not, in proportion to their extent;— small ones are seldom fatal, unless certain adverse circumstances of constitution be present.—See Incised Wounds.

INGUINAL HERNIA. The following account of Hernise is wholly tafcen from Mr. Astley Cooper's practical and valuable treatise on this subject; and the four accompanying plates are accurately reduced from his elegant and large engravings. i. In the reducible state. ' SYMPTOMS. This species of hernia is most common in men, as the femoral is in women, owing to the peculiar structure of the parts in the two sexes. Its first appearance is that of a small tumor, situated about, an inch and a half, on the outer side of the abdominal ring, in a line extending from the pubes to the anterior su- perior spinous process of the ilium. (The hernial sac first emerges from the abdomen at an opening formed in a fascia given off upwards from Poupart's ligament.—See p. Plate III. This aperture is bounded on its upper part by the tendon of the trans- versalis muscle; and is situated between the spinous process of the ilium and pubes ; about an inch and a half to the outer and upper side of the abdominal ring.—See Plate IL—Thus the mouth of the sac, in common cases of hernia, is always on the outside of the epigastric artery.)—It gradually protrudes ob- liquely downwards, and descending through the abdominal ring, I 10

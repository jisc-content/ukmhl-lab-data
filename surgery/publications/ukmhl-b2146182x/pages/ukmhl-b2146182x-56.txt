When abscesses form, they must be freely and boldly laid open, especially when under fascia;; when the swell- ing and hardness of the whole limb will cause some obscurity as to the exact site of the abscess, should the first incision fail, others must be made, till the collection of pus is set at liberty. Punctured wounds often become indolent and indisposed to heal: in this case stimulant injections, setons, dilatations, &c. should be employed, and the wound treated in every respect as a fistulous ulcer. Should inflammation of the absorbents be the consequence of a punctured wound, numerous leeches should be applied along its course;—cathartics, refrigerants, the saline medicine, and other remedies proper for inflammation, should be administered;—re- frigerant lotions should first be applied to the part, and if these are unsuccessful, emollient poultices and hot fomentations.—See the Treatment of Inflammation. POISONED WOUNDS. These are wounds inflicted by poisoned instruments; by the bites of rabid animals; or by the bite or sting of certain reptiles and insects.

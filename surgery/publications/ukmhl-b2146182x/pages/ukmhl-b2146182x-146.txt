INCUINAL HERNIA. 140 pered as with facility to adapt itself to the lower part of the body, which it embraces like a belt.—At its extremity is a pad of a conical form, which, when applied to the mouth of the hernial sac, occasions, by constant pressure, an adhesion to take place between its sides, in consequence of which the patient is cured.— In common hernia, the proper spot for Lhc application of the pad is midway between the symphysis pubis and the spine of the * ilium.—In very large hernhe, it should be brought nearer to the abdominal ring, but never completely upon the pubes.—It should be worn for two years, and during that time left off on no occasion. J I. In Oit: irreducible state. This is a state of hernia in which the tumor is^incapable of being returned into the abdomen by outward pressure. It often in these cases increases to an enormous size. CAUSES OF THE IRREDUCIBLE STATE. 1. The protruded tumor being long suffered to remain down, after having attained a considerable bulk; in which case the ab- domen accommodates itself to its contents, and is no longer able to receivethc protruded, and now extraneous parts. 2. Membranous bands, the consequence of inflammation, forming across the tumor, and thus entangling its contents. 3. An adhesion of the protruded parts to the sides of the sac. 4. Contract ions of the sac at its middle. 5. A scirrhous state of the omentum. TREATMENT. Support is to be afforded to the tumor, by means of an ap- paratus called a bag-truss—This consists in a simple bag, made of calico, connected by attached tapes to a girdle of the same materials, made to encircle the hips. A steady pressure is thus

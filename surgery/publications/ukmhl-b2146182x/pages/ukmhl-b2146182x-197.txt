FISTULA LACHRYMALI* 167 CAUSES. Remote.—Scrofulous inflammation of the membrane lining the nose ;—pustules arising in the duct, in consequence of exanthe-» matous diseases;—syphilitic ozrcna, or ulceration of the mucous membrane cf the nose from whatever cause. Proximate.—An obstruction of the lachrymal duct, from con- traction and thickening of its membrane. TREATMENT. In the early stage of the disease, attempts should be made, to remove the obstruction—by means of a small probe intro- duced at one of the puncta lachrymalia, and passed through the sac and duct into the nose;—by syringing aqueous fluids through the puncta—it has been proposed to inject quicksilver by the same manner;—by repeated and frequent, or constant pressure on the sac; the latter either by means of an instrument invented for the purpose, or by simple compress or bandage. In the inflamed state, local bleeding by leeches;—laxatives, —sedative and refrigerant lotions. See Ophthalmia. An incision into the tumor; and after the inflammation arising from it has subsided, the nasal duct should be searched for with a probe, and, when found, a piece of catgut bougie should be in- troduced and kept there, its edge being bent a little downwards, nil (lie -ides of the duct arc skinned over and healed. Mr. Ware recommends the following mode of treatment: — If an aperture into the lachrymal sac has not already been spon- taneously formed, or if it be formed in an improper situation, a puncture should be made into it, with a common spear-pointed lancet, at a small distance from the internal juncture of the palpebra, just under the tendon of the orbicularis muscle, and about one fourth of an inch within the ridge of the orbit* The

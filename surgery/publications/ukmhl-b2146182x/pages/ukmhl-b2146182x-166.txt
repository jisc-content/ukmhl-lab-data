If, during this period, pain in the head, nausea, loss of appetite and rest- lessness come on, all is not right within the cranium; the most powerful antiphlogistic means must then be adopted, and, if they fail, the operation of trepanning must be performed, espe- cially where the patient complains of fixed pain in a particular spot, where the scalp has been much injured, is detached from the bone, and looks unhealthy, and where the symptomatic fever is considerable; the state of the pulse in these cases, must never be considered diagnostic of the existing derangement, the head and stomach will point out the mischief. An operation will, in common cases, only serve to aggravate the affection; but where concussion is combined with fracture, after the above plan has been fairly practised without affording success, recourse may be had to the use of the trephine, as a possible mode of relief.

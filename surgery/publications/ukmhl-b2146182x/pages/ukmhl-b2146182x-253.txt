DISLOCATION OP THE HIP. 223 TREATMENT Differs from that recommended for the preceding, only in the .extension being required to be made in a direction directly out- wards i whilst the knee is elevated to a right angle with the body, in. Upwards and backwards an the ileum. DIAGNOSIS. The leg is considerably shortened, as may be easily discovered by comparing it with that of the sound sidej-thc foot is turned much inwards;—the limb will not admit of rotary motion, and the great trochanter, on that side, is felt considerably higher than on the opposite. TREATMENT. The belt must be passed around the pelvis, and secured, as directed for the first dislocation.—A second is to encircle the dislocated thigh, immediately above the knee, and with this ex- tension is to be made obliquely downwards, and towards the other leg. IV. Downwards and backwards into the foramen ischii, DIAGNOSIS. The leg is lengthened only in a slight and imperceptible de- gree;—the projection of the trochanter is lost,—the foot is turn- ed greatly inwards. TREATMENT. The body being secured in the usual manner, the thigh is to be drawn upwards towards the abdomen, and depressed against the other leg, when extension is to be made outwards and rather upwards, by means of a roller passed around the thigh above the knee, as before directed; but the utmost perseverance and skill will often be insufficient to effect reduction when the hip has been thus dislocated, l 4

SYPHILIS. 305 ilrargyri, in pills ot five grains, to be taken riignt and morning. Bysubmuriate of mercury, and oxy-miiiiate, Sec. In the use of mercury, under whatever form, it will be pru- dent to begin with a small quantity, and to increase it gradu- ally, until the patient perceive a copperish taste in his mouth, fetor of breath, and a more than ordinary secretion of saliva ; it should then be diminished, and the quantity should after- wards be so regulated as constantly to preserve a slight saliva- tion, without proceeding to any greater length. In administering mercury there are three things to be ob- served : 1. The quantity to be used. 2. The length of time wdiich the system must be kept under its influence. 3. The different effects it has on the constitution. 1st. Of the quantity, if we employ the ointment.—Unguentum, hydrargyri fortius, to which alone we can confide in secondary symptoms, and which should be, generally speaking, preferred to all: we must use five or six ounces for the most recent chancres;— for the first and milder sorts of secondary symptoms, eight or ten ounces will suffice;—and in cases in which the bones are affected, if will scarcely ever be necessary to exceed twelve or fourteen ounces : though in such cases it is almost impossible to draw a line: it must be left to the surgeon's judgment and experience. In local symptoms :—If the submuriate be used, from two to three grains must be given.—It is best exhibited in pills of two or three grains twice a day.—If the pilube hydrargyri are preferred, half a drachm or two scruples must be taken daily for the space of five or six weeks ; or .should the oxydum hydrargyri be chosen, From 'me to five grains for the same period will be necessary.

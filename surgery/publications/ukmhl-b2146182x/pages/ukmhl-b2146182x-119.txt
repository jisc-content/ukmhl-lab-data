.ENCYSTED TUMORS. 99 ENCYSTED TUMORS. The true encysted tumor is a collection of matter contained within a cyst formed by adhesions in the cellular membrane.—— From the nature of its contents, it has obtained different appel- lations, as atheromatous, meliceratous, &c.—Its seat is the cel- lular membrane of any part of the body ; its size usually that of an egg; and it seldom or never increases to a great bulk.—It- begins with a distinctly circumscribed swelling, hard to the feel, and unattended by pain.— It gradually gets larger and larger, until some slight inflammation takes place, when it becomes in a small degree painful, and a fluctuation is soon afterwards dis- tinctly perceived.—As it slowly enlarges, the vessels of the inte« guments become varicose, and in some instances, though nut often, slightly livid. DIAGNOSIS. It is distinguished from common abscess by the extreme slow- ness of its progress to maturation, and by the absence of pain and inflammation. TREATMENT.

In children the operation should be deferred until they have been weaned.—Should there be a fissure on both sides, the second operation should not be performed until a twelvemonth after the first cure has been effected.—In cases where the bony palate is also defective, the dentists have invented an artificial one of silrer* CANCER.

TREATMENT. The most certain mnde of obtaining a cure is the excision of the part.—This, when the disease is not far advanced, may be veadily done by an incision on each side of the diseased portion, made in a direction sufficiently oblique, as that the union of the two may form an angle at the inferior part of the tumor; and after the extirpation of which, that the sides of the wound may be brought together, and united either by the twisted or by the interrupted suture.

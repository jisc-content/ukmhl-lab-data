In a few days the discharge from the urethra is much in- creased, and assumes a greenish or yellowish hue;—a consider- able degree of pain and scalding heat also is experienced on every attempt to make water, called ardor urvia.—Thls is a very general symptom of the complaint; Mr. Pearson, however, affirms that it is not an invariable attendant on it.—If the in- flammation ran high, a chordre is a very frequent consequence; —this is a painful and involuntary erection, accompanied with an incurvature of the penis downwards, and exquisite pain.— The adjacent parts sympathizing with those already affected, the bladder becomes irritable and incapable of retaining its urine for any length of time;—this givos the patient a frequent in- clination to make water, and he feels an uneasiness about the scrotum, perineum, and fundament.—Sometimes the discharge Is more copious from the external surface of the glans, or from the membrane of the prepuce, when phymosis or parapbymosis is nol unfrequently produced.

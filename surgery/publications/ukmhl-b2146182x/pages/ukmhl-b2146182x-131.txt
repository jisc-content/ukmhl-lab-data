109 ANEURISM. stance, along the whole course of the tumor.—On the latter being thus exposed to view, a small opening is to be made into it 'with a lancet, of sufficient size for the admission of the finger; when the whole cavity is to be fairly laid open, from one extre- mity to the other, by running a blunt-pointed bistoury from be- low upwards, and afterwards from above downwards. The next step is to clear the cavity of its contents, by means of the finger, assisted by a sponge. This being done, the tourniquet is to be . slackened in order to discover the opening into the artery; when this is perceived, after renewing the compression, a probe is to be introduced so as to raise the vessel, or it may be taken hold of by a pair of small forceps, and being thus exposed, it is to be secured by a strong ligature passed around it, by means of a blunt curved needle, about half an inch above the opening into the tumor.—The inferior portion of the aitery is next to be tied in like manner, and the ends of the ligatures being brought over the edges of the wound, the latter is to be covered with soft lint, and a pledget of emollient ointment. A compress of linen is then to be applied over the whole, and secured by a roller lightly passed around the limb ; after which the patient is to be conveyed to bed, the limb supported by a soft pillow, laid in a relaxed posture, and covered with warm flannel.—As in all other operations of a similar nature, it will be prudent to allow the tourniquet to remain upon the limb, without any degree of pres- sure, till the danger of haemorrhage is over. It is recommended by surgeons of the present day, in every case where such a mode of practice can be admissible, to expose the artery in a convenient situation above the tumor, and to se- cure it by ligature, in the manner we shall now direct for aneu- rism of the popliteal artery. The ligature should be ■applied to the vessel at some distance above the tumor, as the disease fie-

PARACENTESIS OP THE ABDOMEN, 200 purpose of drawing it off, a small incision is to be made with a common lancet, about an inch below the umbilicus, after which a lancet-pointed trochar is to be pushed forwards, till, from no longer meeting with resistance to its passage, it is ascertained to be within the cavity of the abdomen;â€”the stilette is then to be withdrawn; and as the fluid is evacuated, the bandage, previously fixed around the abdomen, is to be drawn tighter and tighter, to prevent the effects of a sudden removal of the accustomed pressure. After the whole of the water has thus escaped, the wound is to be closed by adhesive plaster, and the body to be encircled with a roller of flannel, which should be suffered to remain for some days after the operation. It is recommended by Dr. Sims, in the Memoirs of the Lon- don Medical Society, to introduce the trochar at the umbilicus, \n this case the first incision will be unnecessary.

WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES. c a PROGNOSIS. These, like wounds of the stomach, generally, though not universally, terminate fatally.—The event will, in great measure, dfpend upon the possibility of uniting the opening in the in- testine. TREATMENT. When the intestine has receded into the abdomen beyond the reach of the surgeon, the same observations will apply to this as to a wound of the stomach. When the divided portion protrudes through the external wound, as is not unfrequently the case, attempts should be mads to procure an union of the parts by suture. If the wound be longitudinal, the uninterrupted suture will be preferable.—The mode of making this consists in inserting stitches, with a common needle, at a moderate distance from each other, in an oblique spiral direction, along the course of the wound, without however dividing the thread, as in other spe- cies. The intestine is then to be returned into the abdomen, and being confined close to the external wound by the ligatures, suffered to hang out, an adhesion generally takes place to the pei itomeum: when an union has been effected, the threads may be withdrawn. To unite circular or transverse wounds of'the intestines, va- rious plans have been recommended.—Mr. J. Bell proposes a su- ture to be made entirely round.—Cylinders of isinglass, or of pasteboard,—rolls of tallow, &c—have been advised to be in- serted within the divided portion.—The insertion of one extre- mity of the wounded intestine within the other, and various other modes of attempting union, have also been suggested.— The interrupted suture appears most likely to be attended with, success.—Four stitches will be necessary; one of winch should

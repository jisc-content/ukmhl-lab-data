FRACTURE OF THE OS FEMORIS. 237 Clined in the contrary direction, the toe being remarkably turned -vards, and almost backwards.-By the greater or less facility mth winch the limb may be moved;_i„ dislocation it can on, b. bent mto a small angle with the body ;-in fracture it admit, of bang drawn up to nearly a right nngle.-By the accident in queshon most frequently happening in old pcople.-By the cre- pitus which takes place upon a forcible extension of the limb. TREATMENT. To retain the divided portions of bone in apposition, various Weans have been proposed, Ead many complicated instrument, have been invented for the purpose; but all attempts hitherto nu, e have been attended with nearly equally unsuccessful results. I -A permanent shortening and disunion, with loss of motion in ■ the Lmb, has mostly beeQ ^ q{ ^ lecident. 1 Union may, however, be attempted in the following manner. -The hmb being forcib.y extended, large and firm compresses fcre to be aid upon the trochanter, and strongly bound by means U a bandage rolled round the hip, and between the thighs of he pat.ent.-A strong deal splint is next to be prepared, of sufii- nent length to reach some way up the side, and this is to be ecurely confined by means of bandages passed round the pelvis m above the knee. t. In the middle. DIAGNOSIS. The presence of a fracture in this part is to be discovered by irefully feeling along the upper side of the bone, when a pro- ving point will generally be discovered; and if at the same me the joint be rotated, a crepitus and preternatural motion at ic fractured part will be observable.

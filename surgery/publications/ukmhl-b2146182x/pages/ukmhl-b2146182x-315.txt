HYDROCELE. 277 shape j—there is no pain nor discolouration of the integuments ; and upon viewing the parts near to a strong light, a transparency is observable. The testicle may generally be felt on the posterior part of the tumor; it is discovered with difficulty when the parts are tensely swoln, as it is then so pushed forward as to be en- tirely surrounded. CAUSES. Violence done to the testicle ;—inflammation;—hot climates; —strictures of the urethra ;—hydatids. DIAGNOSIS. 1 It is distinguished from other diseases by its shape, which is constantly pyramidal, except where the patient has had a hernia, or where the disease has been taken for hernia, and a truss has been worn, when it acquires an obleng shape,—by its transpa- rency; yet this criterion is rendered fallacious when the invest- ing membranes have previously undergone inflammation, in which case they become thickened and impermeable to light;— by the fluctuation of the contained fluid ;-by the tumor having first commenced at the bottom of the scrotum. From hemia.-By the tumor not dilating when the patient coughs;-by the tumor in the one disease commencing at the top of the scrotum, in the other at the bottom;—by the facility of returning the protruded intestine, in reducible hernia, into the abdomen;—and when there is any fluid in an hernial sac, the testicle may always be found and moved on the outside of it' which never is the case in true hydrocele. From disease of the testicle—^ the want of discolouration and hardness; and the abse.ee of that irregularity to the touch pos- scsscd by scirrhus.

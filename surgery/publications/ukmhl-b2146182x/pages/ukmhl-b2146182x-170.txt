140 COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN. For the treatment of the wound, the following rules are ne-. cessary: If the operation has been performed for fracture or depression, unless pieces of bone are expected still to come away, union should be effected by the first intention;—if for the evacuation of blood or matter (sec Inflammation of the Brain), the sore is to be dressed in the lightest and easiest manner, and a speedy suppuration invited by emollient cata- plasms. Certain objectionable parts of tlie head are usually pointed out, lind considered as improper to become the subjects of the above operation.—These are—the course of longitudinal sinuses,— the crucial ridge of the occipital bone,—the anterior and inferior angle of each parietal bone,—and the part immediately covering the frontal sinuses; but in cases of extreme danger these rules should be disregarded.—Perhaps there is no part really objection- able but the last mentioned. There has been much differencs in opinion as to the instruments best adapted to this operation, and a variety have been used. Sir Everard Home recommends the saw whose circle is divided by grooves into three portions, as it per- forms its operation with greater expedition and neatness, and the divisions allow the freer escape of the sawdust:—this is the saw most commonly used. A saw has been invented by Mr. Hey (see his Observations in Surgery), with which protruding points may be removed, so as to admit the elevator, with the loss of a very small portion of uninjured bone.—This, wherever it may be admissible, should be substituted for the trephine. Besides concussion and frac- ture, there are other causes, producing such derangement within the cranium as to require this operation ; such are ossification of the membranes of the brain, partial thickening of the bones of

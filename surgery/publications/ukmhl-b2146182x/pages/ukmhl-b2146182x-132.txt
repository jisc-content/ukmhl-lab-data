ANEURISM. 110 quently extends a considerable way from it; if the ligature be not placed on a sound portion, the operation will not succeed. For Popliteal Aneurism.—Sir Everard Home gives the follow- ing directions for the improved mode of operating for popliteal aneurism, in Transactions of the Society for the Improvement of Medicine and Surgery. An incision is to be made, about three inches in length, on the anterior and inner part of the thigh, at or below its middle,) in a direction obliquely across the inner edge of the sartorius muscle.—This, after being exposed, is to be drawn to the ouUido of the thigh, when the fascia covering the femoral vessels will immediately be seen, lying under and beneath the sartorius and triceps muscles.—A slight incision is then to be made with ex- treme caution through this fascia ; and the artery, thus laid open to view, is to be separated from its lateral connexions with the knife, or by the help of a thin spatula. A double ligature is now to be passed behind it, by means of an eyed probe properly curved, talcing care not to include the contiguous femorttl vein, which is situated on the inside, and the nerve which is situated to the outside of the artery.—The doubling of the ligature is then to be divided, and the two thus formed are to be separated, and securely tied at about the distance of half an inch from each other. After which the intermediate portion of artery is to be cautiously divided, and the coats of the ligatures brought out of the wound, the sides of which are to be kept in apposition by straps of adhesive plaster, in order to effect an union by the first intention. The tumor is not to be opened ; it never will com- pletely subside, but will diminish so much as to produce very slight inconvenience.—The subsequent treatment will be, in every respect, similar to that above described.—The ligatures moj bo removed with safety in about twelve days.

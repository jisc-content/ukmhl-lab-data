240 FRACTURE OF THE OLECRANON. OLECRANON. When the olecranon has been separated from the ulna, the same retraction takes place as in a fracture of the patella; and precisely the same treatment is required. TIBIA AND FIBULA. DIAGNOSIS. Fractures of these bones may be known to have taken place by the irregularity discovered upon carefully feeling along their prominent edge;-by the unnatural motion at the fractured part; —and by the crepitus created by pressure, or au attempt to rotate the leg. TREATMENT. The same refrigerant wash, or soap plaster, will be proper,* as in fracture of the femur; and over one of these the many tailed bandage.—Two splints arc then to be applied, the one on the outside, the other on the inside of the leg:-thc best fox this purpose are Martin's whalebone splints.—In applying tl.em: care should be taken that the outside splint be long enough tc reach completely from the knee to the toes.-The limb may the. be either laid straight out, and still further secured by the aPr > cation of junks and a foot-board, in the way represented » W annexed plate, or it may be laid on its side upon soft PiU«* with the knee a little bent.—See Plate VII.

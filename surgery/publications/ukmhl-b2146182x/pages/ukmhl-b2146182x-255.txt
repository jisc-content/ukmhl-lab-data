DISLOCATION OP THE ANCLE. 225 THE ANCLE. A dislocation of this joint may take place either inwards, out- wards, or forwards. DIAGNOSIS. The two former cases may be ascertained by the inclination of the foot, and by the unnatural protuberance on one side, and deficiency on the other. When the tibia is forced forwards on the tarsus, the foot is considerably shortened j-there is a great and unusual projection of the heel. TREATMENT. Reduction is to be effected by extension, made in the same manner as in a dislocation of the knee. Â«. S

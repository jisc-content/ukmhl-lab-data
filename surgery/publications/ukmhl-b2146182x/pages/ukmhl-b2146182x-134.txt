FALSE OR DIFFUSED ANEURISM. 112 FALSE OR DIFFUSED ANEURISM. This is a tumor produced by an effusion of blood, from a wounded or ruptured artery, into the cellular membrane.— Scarpa maintained that this was the character of all, of the true as well as the false aneurism. He denied the dilatation of the coats of arteries, and endeavoured to prove, by dissection and ancient authorities, that the artery was invariably ruptured, and that the aneurismal sac was formed by the cellular sheath of the vessel. He asserted that all aneurisms, whether internal or ex- ternal, whether circumscribed or diffused, were produced by effusion.—These are opinions which still have their partisans, but are commonly considered to have been satisfactorily re- futed. DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS. It appears in the form of a small compressible swelling, having a strong pulsatory motion.—The progress of its increase varies in different cases; sometimes the enlargement proceeds verr rapidly, at others it is months or years in arriving at any consi- derable size.—It is much more diffused than the true aneurism, and cannot, like that, be made to disappear upon pressure.— The integuments, sooner or later, lose (heir natural appear- ance, ulcerate, and allow a rupture of the internal sac; though sometimes not until the tumor has attained an enormous size. I'alse or diffused aneurisms acquire a livid or marbled appear- ance, the veins become varicose, ulceration ensues, and blood is evacuated. CAUSES. An opening made into an artery, by whatever cause ;—rup- ture from external violence; — puncture in venesection;— erosion from ulcers.

222 DISLOCATION OV THE HI¥: THE HIP. The os fernoris may be dislocated in four different directions. I. Downwards into the foramen ovale. In this case the leg is lengthened by an inch and an half;—the knees are forcibly separated from each other j—the foot is turned outwards ;—a vacancy is perceived in the parts which the head of the bone and the great trochanter usually occupy. TREATMENT. A strong belt or roller must be passed round the pelvis, and the ends carried over the hip of the sound side, where they are either to be firmly held by assistants, or confined to some im- moveable body.—A second roller is now to be passed between the thighs, and its extremities carried in a direction contraiy to he first applied ; i. e. over the dislocated hip—By the latter of these, extension is then to be made in a direction upwards and outwards; the former meanwhile being prevented from altering its position. The operator is at the same time to endeavour to elevate the head of the bone over the projecting acetabulum, by means of a sling passed over his own shoulder, and under the thigh of the patient.—Reduction will be effected with great faci- lity, if the knee be bent to a right angle with the body, and pushed inwards towards the opposite leg. ' n, Forwards on the pubes. DIAGNOSIS. The head of the bone is distinctly felt in the groin, while the projection of the hip, and the usual fulness surrounding it, are lost,—The foot is considerably turned outwards; but the length of the leg is not altered.

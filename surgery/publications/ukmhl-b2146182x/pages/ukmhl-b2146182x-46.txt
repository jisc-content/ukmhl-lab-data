WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES. £28 by which blood is brought tip ;—hiccup;—delirium.—Aliment- ary matter, mixed with blood, escapes at the external wound. PROGNOSIS. The prognosis will ever be unfavourable.—The wound gene- rally proves fatal, either from the sympathetic effect of an injury done to so important an organ; or from the escape of blood or food into the cavity of the peritonaeum. TREATMENT. The wound, like all others into large cavities, should not be closed before all haemorrhage has ceased, until which time the patient should be laid in a situation, in which any blood, already collected, may be evacuated.—It is afterwards to be united by the interrupted suture.—Inflammation should be obviated by a strict antiphlogistic regimen,—repeated bleed- ing,—warm fomentations,—and emollient enemas.—The patient should entirely abstain from food, and all aliment should be conveyed by clysters of broth, milk, and other nutritive ingre- dients;—the thirst should be allayed by a small portion of jelly, or other substance, held in the mouth. Provided the event be favourable, in eight days food may be laken by the mouth. WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES. DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS.

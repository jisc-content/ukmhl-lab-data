168 FISTULA LACHRYMAL I*. blunt end of a small silver pvobe U then to be introduced through the wound, and gently but steadily pushed on in the direction of the nasal duct, with a force sufficient to overcome the obstruction in this canal; it is then to be withdrawn, when a small silver stile., -with a fiat head like that of a nail, is to be in- troduced into the place it occupied, and to be left constantly in it; withdrawing it at first daily for about a week, afterwards every second or third day. Some warm water should each time be injected through the duct into the nose, and after this the instru- ment should be replaced in the same manner as before, and its head covered with a piece of diachylon or court plaster.—The length of time recpuired for the cure of the disease will be vari- ous ; after the expiration of a month or six weeks, the instrument may occasionally be discontinued, and again employed should the cure not have been effected.—Where the disease has been of long standing, and the duct and contiguous parts have become so dis- rased as not to admit the introduction of the probe or stilette, an artificial opening should be made through the os unguis into the nose, by means of a curved trochar, introduced in the direction above recommended for the puncture; after which the stile or bougie should be passed into the opening thus formed, and worn as already described. Other modes of treatment have been recommended, as the introduction of a canula into the nasal duet, Sic. ; but they have beon found liable to objections, from which the above jeenrs exempt.

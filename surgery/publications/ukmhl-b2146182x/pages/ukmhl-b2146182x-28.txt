10 TERMINATIONS OF INFLAMMATION. affected part;—by the pain becoming more lancinating, and ac- companied with a peculiar throbbing of the neighbouring arteries. If the suppuration be superficial, it is known:—by fluctua- tion ;—by the swelling becoming gradually more elevated above the surface of the surrounding cuticle ; acquiring a softness to the feel, and showing a tendency to point in one particular place.— If the process be suffered to go on without interruption, the in- teguments become more and more thin, and change to a -whitish or yellowish colour;—they at length lose their firmness, give way, and pus is discharged at the opening. Difference between Pus and Mucus. Pus is a fluid secretion—opaque, of the colour and consistence of cream,—is discovered by the microscope to consist of a num- her of dense globules, swimming in a transparent fluid:—it is heavier than water, with which it will not mix in the heat of the atmosphere ;—it is unirritating to the part which secretes it ; it differs when secerned by malignant ulcers, and takes the I name of sanies, or ichor. Mucus frequently resembles pus in appearance,—it however swims in water,—is more readily soluble by sulphuric acid : they j' are both soluble by caustic alkali j but when water is added to \ the solution, the pus will separate, whilst, on the contrary, mu- j cus will remain.

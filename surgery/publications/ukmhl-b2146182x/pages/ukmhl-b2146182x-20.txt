2 PHLEGMONOUS INFLAMMATION. CAUSES. Stimuli, either mechanical, chemical, or nervous; as ex- ternal injuries by bruises, wounds, compression, &c.—irrita- tion produced by the presence of extraneous bodies, of what- ever kind;—the application of cold ;—any cause that determine* an increased or irregular impetus of blood to the part; as violent exercise, certain diseases, an inordinate influx of nervous energy. PROGNOSIS. The prognosis in inflammation is to be drawn from the vio- lence of the symptoms; and from the seat of the inflam- mation. Favourable.—The pain, heat, redness, and other inflamma- tory symptoms, gradually diminishing, and at length altogether ceasing; see the Terminations of Inflammation ;—or the swell- in°- becoming more circumscribed j prominent in the centre j soft and fluctuating; see Suppuration; the constitution at the same time being little affected. Unfavourable.—Violent fever with delirium ;—the inflamma- tory appearances suddenly ceasing; followed by the formation of blisters, discharging a thin ichorous matter; the part be- coming of a livid colour, and losing its sensibility. See Mortifi- .cation- TREATMENT. f I. To remove causes that are obvious and continue to operate. II. To niduce the morbid action of the ves- sels of the part, in. To mitigate the-concomitant fever, should the system have become affected. Indicatimts. ,

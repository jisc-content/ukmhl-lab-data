COMPOUND FRACTURE. 243 M 2 and the protruded extremity be so sharp-pointed, as to endanger the production of great irritation were it to be reduced in that state, it will be advisable either entirely to remove it, or, having cut oft' its pointed end, only to reduce the remainder by dilating the wound. The fractured portions of bone being brought in apposition, union, if possible, is to be effected by the first intention; but if the injury to the soft parts has been so extensive as to render the attempt useless, a pledget of lint is to be applied to the wound, the limb is to be encircled with cloths wet with some refrigerant lotion, and afterwards the many-tailed bandage is to be lightly applied ; all pressure being avoided, as likely to increase the attendant inflammation. The limb is either to be supported on pillows, and placed in that position in which the wound may be got at with the greatest facility, or it should be laid in an appropriate fracture-box. If the inflammation run high, recourse must be had to gene- ral or local bleeding,—refrigerants,—opium in large doses. In many instances an operation will become necessary for Uic removal of the limb. The circumstances requiring amputation arc : — 1. Vrery extensive laceration or contusion of the soft part* 0. An opening communicating with a large joint. 3. The division of large arteries. 4. Hectic fever from an extensive suppurating surface. 5. Mortification. 6. The bone greatly splintered. Should the operation be required to be performed immediately after the accident, it will be advisable to draw- blood, in consi- derable quantity, from the incised arteries of the stump, or iYcw the arui.

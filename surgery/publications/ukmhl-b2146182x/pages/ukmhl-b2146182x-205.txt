I'OLYPI IN THE NOSE. 175 CHARACTER* Of the common polypus.—It is pendulous, and hangs by a small pedicle; —it is moveable within the nose; its size is in- fluenced by the state of the weather, the protrusion being lat- est when hazy and damp;—it is of the natural colour of thesUin, 01 of a faint red, in some degree transparent, and free from pain i -^it sometimes projects from the anterior, sometimes from the posterior, aperture into the nose. Of the cancerous polypus.—This is much harder in its texture than the preceding;—it is of a livid colour;—its surface is irre- gular;—it is attended with a peculiarly pungent and lancinating pain j-^it-ulcerates, discharges a fetid matter, and, if not exth> pated, goes on to the destruction of the nose and contiguous parts, and ultimately the life of the patient. TREATMENT. Of the first species.—The topical use of astringents; as alum,, eak-baik, vinegar, ardent spirits.—i-If these prove ineffectual, removal by excision, by means of scissars; or ligature, applied by means of the tonsil instrument.—It may be sometimes suc- cessfully drawn forcibly away with the forceps. Of the second species.—Excision, or forcible extraction, practicable;—the internal and external use of opium and conium —an injection of tinctura ferri muriatis, and the oxygenated muriatic acid diluted.

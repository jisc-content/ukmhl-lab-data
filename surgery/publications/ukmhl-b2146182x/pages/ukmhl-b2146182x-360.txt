AMPUTATION OP THE LE<5< 320 OF THE LEG. The toumeqnet being properly applied, and the leg sup- ported as before directed, an incision is to be made through the integuments, about six inches below the knee; and when the adhesions which connect them to the fore part of the tibia and fibula have been separated, they are to be drawn up by an as- sistant. The muscles of the leg are next to be completely divided by a circular incision, close to the retracted integuments. The object is now to divide all that connecting substance be- tween the two bones: this is to be done by means of a sharp- pointed double-edged knife made for this purpose.—After which both the bones are to be sawn through, by the same action of the saw, at a distance from the knee equal to the breadth of the "hand.—The remaining part of the operation will be exactly simi- lar to the before described. OF THE HUMERUS. in amputations of the superior extremity, the most convenient part for the application of the tournequet is about midway be- tween the shoulder and the elbow joint; where it is to be adjusted 46 before described, with the pad over the principal artery. The first incision is to be begun about an inch above the joint, and the operation concluded precisely as in the thigh. OF THE FORE-ARM. As in the leg before the knee,

Sudorifics; the pulvis ipecacuanhas compositus.-antimony umted with opium.-submuriate of mercury with antimony {-a* the same time using decoctions of mezereon.-sarsapwill.,- guaiacum. The warm bath;—the occasional use of opium. NODE. A swelling most frequently in the periosteum or cylindrical bones ; and on the bones of the cranium. SYMPTOMS. After deep-seated, obtuse, and di.stres.ing pain, attended with a nightly exacerbation, a prominent rising upon the surface of » bone;—hard to the touch,—sometimes insensible, and unat- tended by discolouration of the integuments; at others consi- derably inflamed and sore.

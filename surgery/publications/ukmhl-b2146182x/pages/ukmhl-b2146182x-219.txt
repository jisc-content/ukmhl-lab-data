The disease usually commences with a slight difficulty of de- glutition, especially in swallowing solid food;-this continues to increase for some months, during which the patient is obliged to mince the solid food which he takes—At length the passage becomes so narrow, that not the smallest particle can pass; but after being for a short time detained at the contracted part, it is rejected with a peculiar hollow noise, and with the appearance of convuWon.-If preventive means are not taken, the stric- ture becomes more and more contracted, and at length so much so, as not even to admit the passage of fluids—Emaciation en- sues, and the patient is eventually starved.-Ulceration some- times takes place, attended with severe lancinating pain and hec- tic fever, CAUSES. A niorhid thickening of the mucous membrane of the eso- phagus, induced by a previous state of inflammation, or abra- sion, from whatever cause;-from the swal lowing of hot fluids, or from a wound inflicted by an extraneous body accidentally lodged in the part.

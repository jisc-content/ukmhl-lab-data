In the present disease the parts are more tense to the feel; the joints, particularly the ancles, possess considerable rigidity, by which the feet are often pointed downwards;—added to these, the affection of the loins sufficiently points out the na- ture of the disease. TREATMENT. A caustic issue, such as directed for the disease of the hip, to he made on each side of the protuberant portion of the spine, and suffered to remain open until the patient recover the use of his limbs; at the same time employing- tonics, and other remedies recommended for the cure of scrofula, and occasionally sprinkling the sore with a small quantity of finely powdered blistering-fly. EXOSTOSIS Is a morbid growth of bone, forming a circumscribed tumor of great hardness; which sometimes acquires an immense size; it is most frequently met with upon cylindrical bones:-it is sometimes firmly osseous; at. others of a cretaceous consistence, and often partly cartilaginous. CAUSE. A diseased actionof the bone from an uncertain cause. TREATMENT. If formed upon a part little essential to life, and when of no very considerable size, it may be removed with perfect safety.— In performing the operation, the integuments should be saved, that they may afterwards be united by the first intention; and the tumor, if perfectly osseous, requires the use of a small saw for its removal.

CONSEQUENCES OF BLOOD-LETTING. 54> The morhtd Consequences of Blood-letting, I. INFLAMMATION OF THE INTEGUMENTS. This will be either phlegmonous or erysipelatous, according as certain local or constitutional circumstances may happen to be present.—The symptoms and cure have been already de- scribed when treating of inflammation in general. II. INFLAMMATION OF THE VEIN. SYMPTOMS. The vein swells, and becomes capable of being distinctly traced in its course along the limb, by an unusual hardness to the feel, and by an erysipelatous inflammation which runs over it.—Much pain and stiffness of the arm is occasioned.—Sup- puration often shortly takes place ; most violent rigors come on, accompanied with much fever and irritation.—It has proved fatal, from the admixture of pus with the circulating fluids. TREATMENT. In order to prevent the extension of the inflammation along the course of the vessel, a compress should be tightly applied upon the vein, at some distance above the punctured part, in order to effect an union between its sides.— Should this be in- effectual, a complete division of the tube is recommended.—Fo- mentations and other local remedies should be assiduously em- ployed.

ERYSIPELATOUS INFLAMMATION. 6 ments.—The heat is peculiarly acrid and mordent. If the in- flammation be extensive, the patient becomes affected with fever; the pulse is usually small, hard, and frequent; the tongue at first white, afterwards becoming brown.—After a shorter or longer continuance of the inflammatory symptoms, the redness diminishes, the part becomes yellow, the cuticle falls off in scales ; or vesicles are formed containing a limpid, in some esses a yellowish, fluid. CAUSES. Erysipelatous inflammation may arise from the same causes as the phlegmonous;—it is more liable to attack women and children, and those of an irritable habit, than the plethoric and robust.—Some people are so peculiarly predisposed, that no ac- cident, however slight, fails to induce it; and every inflamma- tory affeetion puts on the erysipelatous form. PROGNOSIS. Favourable.—The inflammation of a vivid red colour, and not extending over a large surface;—the fever, when the con- stitution has become affected, assuming the inflammatory form; the pulse being full, and not rapid ; the tongue white; the strength little impaired. Unfavourable.—The inflamed parts becoming of a dark red or rose colour, brown, or livid;—the inflammation rapidly ex- tending ;— the fever assuming the typhoid form;—the pulse small, hard, and rapid;—the tongue covered with a brown fur;—coma ; -—delirium ;—great prostr ation of strength ;—sudden depression c-f the swelling, succeeded by livid vesications.

20 THE INCISED WOUND. it >to coagula formed in the surrounding cellular membrane, which stopped the flow of blood, till the vessel closed by adhe- sive inflammation. A new theory has been proposed by Dr. Jones, and supported by him with a series of experiments : it is as follows: It appears that an artery, when divided, instantly pours out its contents, and, contracting a little, forcibly retracts itself within its investing sheath, from which it tears itself, leaving the inner surface of it rough and jagged, by lacerating or stretching the cellular fibres which united them together Through this canal of sheath, left by the retracted artery, thÂ« blood escapes, entangling itself in its torn and uneven surface, and, adhering to it, lays the foundation of. a coagulum at the mouth of the artery, and in the sheath, which, gradually in- creasing, fills up its circumference and stops the bleeding. This process is of course assisted by any languor of the circulation, induced by the loss of blood. The mouth of the vessel thus obstructed, the blood within it ceases to flow, and forms also a slight conical coagulum, which adheres by its base to the internal coat of the vessel, and is quite distinct from the external coagu- lum above mentioned. The vasa vasorum of the divided sur- face becoming slightly inflamed, now pour out coagulable lymph, which fills up the mouth of the vessel, and closely uniting with its internal, adheres to both the internal and external coagula, and thus firmly and permanently closes the wound. The coagula are quickly absorbed, and the vessel itself degenerates into a li- gamentous substance. When an artery is only wounded, the blood rushes into the cel- lular membrane and into the sheath, which it distends, and forces the opening in it from its relative situation with that of the artery, which slips under it. The blood tl.cn coagulating within the- sheath, is thus bound over the wound in the artery, and tha

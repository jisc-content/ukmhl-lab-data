24 WOUHpS OF THE CHEST. Should pain, tension, and inflammation, succeed the applies* tion of ligatures, recourse must be had to emollient poultice? and fomentations,—topical bleeding, or refrigerant applications, as the dilute liquor of acetate of lead ;—and if these be ineffec- tual, the ligatures should be removed. Few wounds, in the improved practice of surgery, require to be united by suture; the adhesive straps are generally found equally effectual, and have the advantage of not creating irrita- tion. To these, bandages and compresses properly applied yield a very essential assistance, and must not be omitted. When union by the first intention is impracticable, suppura- tion must be promoted by appropriate means.—See Contused Wounds, and Abscess. WOUNDS OF THE CHEST. Some authors divide wounds of the chest into four species :— a'division into two will, however, be quite sufficient. {1. Where the wound penetrates the cavity wiUi- out injuring the viscera. ii. Where the viscera are wounded. DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS. Of the first specks.—Extreme anxiety and difficulty of breath- ing;—at each inspiration the lung protrudes through the wound- ed part;—great irritation at the larynx;—cough;—and the pa- tient, upon attempting to lie down, feels a sense of suffocation. Of the second species.—Blood is coughed up of a liorid red colour, frothy and mixed with air;—great difficulty of breathing; —in inspiration, air is heard to issue from the external wound with a hissing noise, and to rush in with a similar sound during expiration;—emphysema very generally takes place, first begin- ning in the cellular membrane of the thorax, and often spread - ing to a great extent.

161- PROTRUSION OF THE EYE. DROrSY OF THE EYE Consists in a preternatural accumulation of the aqtiemi* humour.—It is attended by a sense of fulness in the eyeball ;— the motions of the eyelids, by degrees, become impeded;— vision gradually becomes more and more imperfect, till at last the patient can only distinguish light from darkness. The ball of the eye becomes gradually enlarged 5—the cornea begins to protrude, and, if suffered to proceed, at length bursts, and the fluid is discharged. TREATMENT. 1 A puncture or incision made at the under edge of the cornea, into the anterior chamber of the eye, or through the sclerotic coat, into the posterior, of sufficient extent to admit ef the evacuation of the fluid. PROTRUSION OF THE EYE. The protrusion of the eyeball beyond its socket is not an un- frequent effect of external violence;—it may also be produced by tumors fanning behind it, by a dropsical affection of the eye it-elf, or by an enlargement of the lachrymal gland. TREATMENT. When the consequence of external injury, if the eyeball be not entirely separated from the neighbouring parts, it should be carefully {rce^ from extraneous matter, and returned to it* situation; when the faculty of sight will often be recovered, should the optic nerve remain uninjured.—When it arises from collections within the.eyc itself, these are to he evacuated. See J)rapsy and Abscess.—Other cnuics are to be removed by the means proper for each.

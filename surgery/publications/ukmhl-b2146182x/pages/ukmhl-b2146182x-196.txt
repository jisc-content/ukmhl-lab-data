FISTULA- LACHRYMALIS. FISTULA LACHRYMALIS. Fistula lachrymalis is a sinuous or fistulous ulcer of the la- chrymal sac or duct—Its progress to this state may be divided into three stages. SYMriOMS. Of the first stage.—A small tumor between the inner corner; •f the eye and side of the nose, which disappears upon pressure, but soon returns after the compressing cause is removed—The eye is constantly moistened with tears mixed with mucus, which also frequently flow over the cheek—Sometimes a slight opln thalmia, or inflammation of the eyelids, succeeds, and the latter are often found glued together upon awaking from sleep—The disease in this state has been called the watery eve, or dropsy ot the lachrymal sac. Of the sccoud stage—The swelling enlarges in size, inflames, and suppurates--there is considerable pain and discolouration, and, upon pressure, pus is discharged from the puncta lachry- malia. Of the third stage.—At length the abscess bursts ;-if the aperture be small, it frequently heals and burst, alternately, until the opening becomes sufficiently large to p.,vent any further collection—The disease in this state exhibits the appear- ance of a sinuous ulcer, with callous, sometimes with retortefl, edges, and now forms what is properly the fistula lachrymalis— The passage from the sac into the tu.se is completely obstructed and tears, mucus, and purulent matter, are abundantly d„ charged, and flow down the cheek-In some instances the con J t.jguous bone becomes carious.

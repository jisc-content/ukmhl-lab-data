82 BURNS AND SCALDS. TREATMENT. Two different and opposite modes have of late been proposed for the treatment of burns, each of which has numerous advo- cates. Sir James Earle recommends the use of cold applications, and the antiphlogistic treatment: he directs the parts to be immediately immersed in cold water; in water cooled by ice; or that ice or snow, if either can be procured, should be applied to them. Mr. Kentish, on (he contrary, advises the topical and inter- nal administration of powerful stimuli.—His plan of treatment is as follows : The parrs are lirst to be bathed two or three times with spirit of wine, with camphorated spirit, or oil of turpentine made warm by standing in hot water; — after which a liniment is to be applied, composed of the ceratum resin* liavae softened with turpentine. P<. Cerati resinae fBj. Oloi terebinthinaa O. fs. Add the oil of turpentine to the cerate previously melted, and mix. This first dressing need not in general remain on more than twenty-four hours, and will very seldom be required a second time. The burnt surface should be as little as possible exposed to the air between the dressings. The second application, ablution with proof spirit ; and thus successively milder applications, till the cure is effected. Internally; xthcr, brandy, opium; afterwards wine, ale, &c. until suppuration takes place, when the most bland applica- tions arc to be substituted fur the stimulating.

83 BURNS AND SCALDS. Mr. Cleghora, a brewer at Edinburgh (see Medical Facts and Observations, vol. ii.), has treated burns with success, by ap- plying, in the first place, vinegar, until the pain abates; — secondly, an emollient poultice;—and thirdly, as soon as any secretion appears, by covering the sore with powdered chalk. Lime-water, with linseed oil, has been often used :— LIXIMEXTVM OLE1 CUM CALCE Ph. Guy. R. Olei Hni Jjfs. Liquoris calcis Jiij. Misce. Fiat linimentum partibus affectis applicandum. Some surgeons are very partial to the application of lime- w*ter and spirit immediately after the accident, if the cuticle be entire. R. Spiritfts tenuioris Jiij. Liquoris calcis Jvj. Misce. T'nis should be used cold, and the parts kept constantly covered with it by means of fine linen cloths. Dr. Underwood advises the application of liquefied soap. Many experienced surgeons apply a mixture of calamine cerate and acetate of lead : — CERATUM CALAMINE CUM ACETATE PLUMRI. R. Cerati calaininae trjj. Liquoris plumbi acetatis Ji.j. Misce. Raw potatoes pounded or FcrapeJ to a proper degree of fineness, may be advantageously employed. E G

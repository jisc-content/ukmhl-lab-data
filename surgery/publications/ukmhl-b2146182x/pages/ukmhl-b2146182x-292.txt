260 FISTULA IN PEHINEO. CAUSES. External violence;—stricture, preventing the free passage of the uriue, hence producing a morbid accumulation and a burst- ing of the urethra;—stone impacted in the urethra operating in the same manner. TREATMENT. To evacuate the effused urine. To remove the cause which induced the dis- ease, if it still Temains and becomes an obstacle to the cure. For this purpo»e- a free incision is to be made into the tumor, and the collected urine being evacuated, the wound should be kept open, by the application of appropriate dressings, until granulations arise, and the communication with the urethra is. nearly closed, when a bougie should be daily passed, to prevent a consequent contraction of the canal of the urethra. Mr Should the disease have arisen from an obstruction in tha urethra, either by stricture, ov by the presenee of calculus, it will become necessary, after having evacuated the urine, to re- move the obstructing cause. Vide Calculus in the Urethra, and Stricture.—The stricture may in some cases be advantageously dilated with the knife, at the time the incision is made for let- tiajr out the effused fluid. FISTULA IN PERINEO Is a sinuous or fistulous ulcer in the perineum, communicat- ing witli the bladder, or with the urethra.

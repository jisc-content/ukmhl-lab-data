POISONED WOUNDS. THE CAR\rATIC SNAKE PILLS. Take of White arsenic, Roots of velli-navi, — neri-visham, Kernels of nervalam, Pepper, Quicksilver; of each an equal quantity. The quicksilver is to be rubbed with the juice of the wild cotton till the globules become invisible. The arsenic being first levigated, and the other ingredients reduced to powder, are then to be added, and the whole beaten up together, with the juice of the wild cotton, to a consistence lit to be divided into pills of six grains. Dr. Russel gives the following directions for using these pills : If a person be bitten by a cobra de capello, mix one of the pills with a little warm water, and give it. to the patient. After wait- ing a quarter of an hour, should the symptoms of infection in- crease, give two pills more; should these not sufficiently coun- teract the poison, another pill must be given an hour after. This is generally found sufficient. For the bite of all kinds of vipers give two pills; and if the poison be not, counteracted within half an hour give two pills more : but if the life of the patient be in great danger, four pills may be given. For the bite of all other less poisonous snakes one pill, every morning for three days, is sufficient. The juice of the ruta graveolens or rue. Barton. Spiritus ammonias aromaticus,—sulphuric icther,—Venice treacle. Dr. Temple recommends the caustic volatile alkali, or spiritus ammonias succinates, to be administered every five minutes.

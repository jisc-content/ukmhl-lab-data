85 PARONYCHIA, OR WHITLOW. The paronychia is a phlegmonous tumor, occupying the extremity of the finger—From its different seat, it has been elassed into four species. The Jim species is situated around the nail, immediately under the cuticle.—It appears in the form of a small welling, at- tended with a degree of redness and some pain, at the root or at one corner of the nail ;-the skin is very little discoloured;- it quickly advances to suppuration, when the cuticle appears almost transparent—After the contents of this little abscess have been evacuated, the ulcer soon spontaneously heals—The. loss of the nail is however in some instances, through improper treatment, the consequence of the disease. TREATMENT. Lotions of camphorated spirit, or a solution of the muriate •f ammonia, to resolve the inflammation. R. Ammonia; niuriatis Jj. Acidi acetic: impuri Jij. Spiritus tenuioris Jj. Aquae distillate txii. Fiat lotio.

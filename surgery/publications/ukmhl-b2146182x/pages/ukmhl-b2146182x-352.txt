314- NODE. Suppuration sometimes takes place within the bone;—aper- tures are formed by the ulcerative process, through which the fluid escapes;—the tumor, before hard, is now soft to the touch, and increased in size, and the fluctuation of a fluid be- tween the periosteum and the bone is perceptible.—The integu- ments at length burst, when, upon examination, holes are often found communicating with the interior part of the enlarged por- tion of the bone, which is hollow, and surrounded with a thick deposit of ossific matter, or exostosis. TREATMENT. If there be much inflammation and pain, occasiotaal' bleed- ing by leeches, and blisters, will be useful—See Inflammation of Bone. , If it be insensible to the touch, the emplastrum hydrargyri. Should suppuration ensue, a free incision,—and afterwards the tise of topical mercurial remedies. Mercury is to be gradually introduced into the system by fric- tion, and the mercurial action kept up for some time after the total disappearance of the symptoms, as before directed; at the same time the patient must constantly take the decoctum sarsa- parillas, or the decoctum sarsaparilhe compositum. Nodes generally disappear gradually as the course proceeds :— when they are very painful, it is advised to divide down to the bone, separate the periosteum a little from it, and dress the wound with dry lint till suppuration comes on. If the bone be not pre- viously injured, this will not excite exfoliation. When the pa- tient can bear pressure without pain, there is not much fear ot a relapse, although the node remains,

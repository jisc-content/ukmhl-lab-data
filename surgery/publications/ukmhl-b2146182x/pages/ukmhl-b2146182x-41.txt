THE INCISED WOUND. in. Union by the first intention is to be effected by drawing the divided parts closely into contact; and retaining them in that situ- ation by means adapted to the extent and situation of the wound. If the wound be small, or however extensive it may be, pro- vided it be superficial only,—adhesive straps are the most proper application for this purpose.—Their number should be in pro- portion to the extent of the wound ; their breadth about an inch and an half; and in applying them, one end is to be fastened at a moderate distance from the edge on one side, and while the union of the parts is preserved by an assistant, the other is to be conducted over to the opposite, and being drawn tight, is to be affixed to the integuments by pressure with the warm hand.—A small aperture should be left between the straps, in the most de- pending part of the wound, for the evacuation of any matter which may happen to form. Where the wound is of considerable depth, or where the edges have much retracted, as also more especially in wounds into cavitks,-into the joints,-in wounds of the face and neck, -in all triangular wounds,-alld in transverse wounds of mus- cles,-the use of the interrupted suture may sometimes be ne- cessary.-In making this, the fewer the number of stitches, in general, the more speedy and effectual the union—Each needle with an appropriate ligature attached to it, is to be introduced a! advance from the edge, equal to half the depth of the wound • and being carried to near the bottom, should be drawn out at a corresponding point on the opposite side.-The threads of each needle are to be cut successively of an equal and moderate length j but not secured until the whole have been passed—Adhesive •traps should now be applied between the stitches, in the man- ner above described ; and the whole covered with a compress of bnt, and a loose roller.

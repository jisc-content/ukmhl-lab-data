AMPUTATION OF THE THIGH. 317 above the vessel, and firmly secured in its situation by tighten- ing the screw on the other side of the limb. Should the limb be at all cedematous, it will be necessary, after the tournequet has been on a minute or two, to tighten it again ; as, by the pressure, the fluid underneath it'passing into the surrounding cellular sub- stance, will loosen the instrument. Care must be taken in such an instance, that it be not again slackened after the first inci- sion, from the escape of the fluids. The assistant to whom the management of the tournequet is intrusted should be one, on whom thorough dependence can be placed. After this has been adjusted, the limb being supported by an assistant, a circular incision should be made through the inte- guments, immediately above the knee-joint (see Plate XI. fig. l); and any adhesions that may impede their retraction having been separated, they are to be drawn up as high as possible (see fig. 2), when a second incision should sever either the whole of the mus- ■cles of the thigh, or the loose muscles only; leaving those at- tached to the bone to be divided by a third. The quantity of integuments dissected should be fully sufficient to cover the face of the stump, as it is better to save too much than too little. The bone now exposed, is to be cleared of its periosteum, and any portions of muscle that may still adhere. The muscles and integuments are next to be drawn up by the assistant, and se- cured by some folded linen (see fig. 3). The bone is then to be di- vided with the saw, at that part where it is connected with the retracted integuments : should any spiculse or projecting points remain, these are to be removed. The next step is to secure the arteries; and this should be carefully done by means of the tenaculum and ligature.—A flan- nel or linen roller is then to be passed around the thigh, to pre- y 3

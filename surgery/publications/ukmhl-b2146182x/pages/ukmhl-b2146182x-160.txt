ISO FEMORAL OR CRURAX HERNIA. the insertion of the diiplicature of the arch ends (vide New Method of operating for Femoral Hernia, translated from the Spanish of Don Antonio de Gimhernat), and on the inside of the great secondary iliac vein, there is left a foramen sufficiently distinct and almost round, at which many lymphatics enter.—A lymphatic gland is sometimes fitted into this foramen, and the parts which form the crural hernia always pass through it; con- sequently we may properly call it the crural ring."—" A single gland, placed in this ring, would prevent the issue of the parts contained in the abdomen; but if a portion of the intestine should slide behind, so as to get out of the cavity, it would be very difficult to distinguish the hernia at first." DIAGNOSIS. It is distinguished from bubonocele by the tumor being seated deeper and more laterally; and the ring of the abdominal muscles, which lies entirely above the tumor, in femoral her- nia, completely surrounding the parts in the inguinal kind;— from bubo, in the reducible state, by the capability of reduc- tion ; in the strangulated state, by the symptoms of strangula- tion ;—from psoas abscess, by the fluctuation of the tumor in the latter disease; and by the preceding long-continued and deep-seated pain in the loins. TREATMENT. The treatment laid down for inguinal hernia will, for the most part, be applicable to the species now under consideration. In the manual attempts at reduction, the tumor should be pressed in a direction upwards, and inwards towards the abdo- men ; and at the same time, downwards towards the pubes. In strangulated femoral hernia, it will always be necessary to lay bare the contents of the hernial sac. The strangulation may be 4

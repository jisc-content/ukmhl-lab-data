19 THE INCISED WOUND. the centre of the wound, cicatrization commences, processes of skin shoot from the surrounding edges, and extending, at length completely enclose the newly-formed parts. The new skin differs from the old skin in some measure, both in its pro- perties and durability. PROGNOSIS. The prognosis will chiefly depend upon the situation (see wounds of the different parts of the body), and the extent of the wound. Unfavourable circumstances are—great irritability of constitu- tion ;—the constitution of the patient impaired by age, or in- ebriety;—debility, however induced;—the division of large ar- teries, or of numerous absorbent vessels;—the firm texture of the part favouring a considerable retraction of the edges;—the presence of certain extraneous bodies, which cannot be readily removed;—too great inflammation, when sphacelus is likely to ensue;—deficient inflammation, when the progress of union is retarded, or entirely suspended. TREATMENT. I. To put a stop to the haemorrhage, li. To remove any extraneous bodies that may happen to be present, in. To effect an union by the first intention; or, if that be impracticable, to pro- mote the formation of pus. i- A haemorrhage from a small vessel will often spontaneous- ly stop, and various theories have been started to account for this. .Some have supposed that it was effected solely by the contraction of the divided vessel, whilst others have attributed

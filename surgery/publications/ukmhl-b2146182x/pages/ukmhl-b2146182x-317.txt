HYDROCELE. 275 there is any doubt about the nature of the disease; when it is with a suspensory bag, or the T bandage. The common lancet is by some very good surgeons preferred to the trochar, as be- ing the safest instrument: when it is used, it should be plunged >nto the most prominent part of the tumor, till the water issues out; a probe or director should then be introduced, to prevent the sides of the wound collapsing, and the consequent effusion of water into the cellular membrane. No exercise nor exertion should be used by the patient for some time after this operation.

It is to be injected by means of an elastic bottle and stop-cock, pre- viously adapted to the canula of the trochar; and when the tu- mor has by this means been made to regain its original size, the cock ,s to be turned, and the lower part of the syringe un- screwed from its neck, which should be suffered to remain within the canuia.-The patient will soon begin to complain of pain in the part, and colic pains across the abdomen; when these occur, and not until then, the neck of the instrument is to be with- drawn from the canula, the wine or injected liquor discharged, and the patient should be conveyed to bed.

There arc many other means of exciting the necessary inflamma- tion, but the above is the most successful : when, however

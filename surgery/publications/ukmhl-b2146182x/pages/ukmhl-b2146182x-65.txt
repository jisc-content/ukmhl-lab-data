There is seldom any hemorrhage; the inflammation Wh.ch constantly attends contused wounds comes on in this spe- eds much later than usual—About the second day the parts commonly become tumid, and the wound pours forth a gela- Itmous lymph, when symptoms of constitutional irritation arise ■which are generally severe; in extensive wounds not unfre- quently mducing spasm, convulsions, and even death -A dis- charge truly purulent seldom comes on before the eighth or tenth day ; when sloughs begin to separate, and the wound assumes a healthy appearance. PROGNOSIS. This will depend upon the extent of the injury, the importance Of the part in which it has been inflicted, and the degree of con- shtutmnal irritation supervening.-It will also be drawn from he disposition to gangrene ;_from the peculiarity of constitu- tion by which consequent symptoms are likely to be aggravated- as the patient being the subject of organic disease, or having •ted an .nebrious, dissipated life; in this case t)le prognosis will ever be unfavourable. In general the danger cannot at first be -ertamed; parts will afterwards often slough away and pro- duce a fatal hemorrhage, or other consequences, which were not at first suspected to be injured.

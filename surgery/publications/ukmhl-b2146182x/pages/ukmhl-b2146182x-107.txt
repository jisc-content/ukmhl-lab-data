There is great inflammation of the parts; much restlessness; a considerable degree of fever, and more or less delirium, accord- ing to the greater or less violence of the complaint. TREATMENT.

The fourth species is where the matter is formed beneath the periosteum, or where the bone itself is diseased.—In this, the pain is much more deeply seated, ami, though not so acute, is more distressing than in the former species; in some cases, so much so, as early to induce fever and delirium.—The disease is more local than (he preceding! the arm and hand being little affected, and the swelling of f!,e part much-less considerablej —the finger frequently becomes livid, is covered with little blisters containing a bloody scrum, and threatens mortification.

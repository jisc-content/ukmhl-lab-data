27 WOUNDS OF THE STOMACH. TREATMENT. After suppression of the liEernorrhage by the usual means, union by the first intention should be always attempted, and where there is not much laceration this will frequently take place; the hamiorrhage is seldom troublesome, unless the epigastric ar- tery be divided; it must be suppressed by the usual means ; the patient's position should be such as to relax the abdominal mus- cles, and the applications should be as simple as possible. For incised wounds, the adhesive plaster and a bandage; and for punc- tured wounds, a pledget of unguentum cera, with moderate pres- sure, are the best applications : spare diet, mild purgatives, and general bleeding, must be adopted against the chance of perito- neal inflammation. It is sometimes, though very rarely, neces- sary to have recourse to suture; and where large cavities are laid open, those who are in the habit of using sutures, prefer the quilted suture. The quilted suture is simply the interrupted suture with a double ligature, and supported by small cylindrical bodies (pieces of quilt or bougie) placed on each side of the wound, by which its edges are more effectually compressed.—The double of the li- gature is made to inclose the one, and the knot to press directly upoji the other; by this means the sides of the wound ar» made closely to approximate.

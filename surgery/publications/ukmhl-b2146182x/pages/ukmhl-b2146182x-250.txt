- £20 DISLOCATION OF T*HE JIADIUS AND ULKA. elbow of the dislocated arm.—By the letter of these a gradual extension must now be made, in a direction obliquely downwards and outwards; the body being at the same time kept irnmovc- ably fixed, by assistants drawing the former belt in an opposite direction.—After this extension has been kept up for a short time, duriDg which it should be gradually increased in force, the operator is with one hand to draw or push back the scapula, with the other to direct the bone into its cavity. When the luxation has been of long standing, or in cases where the head of the bone is protruded fur forwards under the pectoral muscle, extension can seldom be made, by the hands of assistants, with sufficient force.—In such cases it will be neces- sary to employ the pullies invented for this purpose.—Reduction may also be facilitated by bleeding,—the warm bath,—by the use of opium,—and by the administration of a tobacco clyster. THE RADIUS AND ULNA. The radius, with 1 he ulna, maybe dislocated either upwards and backwards, or partially inwards and outwards.—The radius may be dislocated forwards. DIAGNOSIS. When the dislocation is upwards and backwards, the fore-arm is shortened, the olecranon of the ulna projects, and is higher than usual; the extremity of the humerus cannot be felt in the bend of the elbow. When inward, the sight alone will be sufficient to ascertain the displacement of the bone. When the radius is dislocated alone, it is generally thrown forwards on the external condyle of the humerus,—In this case

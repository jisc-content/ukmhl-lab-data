10i ENLARGEMENTS OP ABSORBENT GLANDS. a long train of scrofulous affections. The gland continues f enlarge, but its progress to maturation is extremely slow j there is seldom any considerable pain, neither is that degree of in- flammation present which is common to abscess in general; anil it often increases to a large size before fluctuation is perceptible; —the skin acquires a brown or livid colour.—At length, and if preventive means are not duly taken, ulceration of the integu- ments ensues, and a thick curd-like matter, or white coagulum floating in a thin fluid, is discharged. An inflammation of the absorbent glands of the neck, by causing an irritation of the surrounding cellular substance, sometimes gives rise to the formation of a steatomatous or sar- comatous tumor, which often enlarges to a considerable size. This generally becomes pendulous, and sometimes so huge as to extend to the shoulder.—It is more vascular than the common steatoma, and from the constitution of the patient does not ap- pear to originate in a scrofulous affection. CAUSES. When the tumor assumes the above character, it may be uni* yersally deemed a scrofulous affection.—Enlargements of the glands from other causes almost universally terminate by resolu- tion ; or, if suppuration supervene, the progress is rapid, as im the common phlegmon. TREATMENT. Locally.—la the incipient state, discussion should be at- tempted by the application of leeches and cold lotions ; as, the solution of sulphate of zinc,—a solution of alum,—or the liquor plumbi acetatis dilulus, with the addition of about a quarter part of vinegar or camphorated spirit.—If the inflam- mation be trilling, a weak solution of hydrargyruj owmuriH- Vus in lime-water;

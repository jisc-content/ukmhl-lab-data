PREFACE. The writer of this small volume, containing a com- pendium of Surgery, was induced to present it to the public, as a companion to the Anatomist'^ and Physician's Vade-Mecum, and it is accord- ingly conducted on the same plan. The arrangement of the diseases is such as is most generally adopted in works on Surgery:—the definition of every disease is first given:—the va- rious causes by which it is produced immediately follow:—the diagnostic and prognostic symptoms precede the cure, which contains the modern and most approved methods of operating, and the best remedies. Throughout the whole, the author has aimed at brevity and perspicuity ; and he trusts the student and young practitioner, for whom it is principally intended, will find he has not been inattentive in selecting the opinions of the most eminent surgeons in Europe. The present edition is considerably enlarged, and Plates are added to illustrate the mode of perform- ing the most important operations.

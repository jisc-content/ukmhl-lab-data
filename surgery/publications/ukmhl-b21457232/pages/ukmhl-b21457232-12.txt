AINSLIE HOLLIS. interpretation of their function is a true one, it follows that we have here to deal with little masses of protoplasm, formerly endowed with independent powers of locomotion. To some writers who doubt the presence of vagrant corpuscles among the arterial tissues, except as rare, and hence uninteresting, strangers, this suggestion will not be acceptable; yet the existence of' free nuclei' in such situations is admitted by many pathologists. If we grant these independent bodies the power of locomotion Fig. 3.â€”Transverse section of an oesophageal branch of an atheromatous aorta. Early stage of endarteritis proliferens.

We can then account for their dissimilarity in the inner and the outer layers of the endothelium. The newly formed cellular lining of the vessel, less cohesive than the older basement cells, permits freer movements among nuclear bodies embedded within it; hence their spheroidal or broadly pyriform shapes when compared with the slender spindle-like corpuscles of the deeper layers, for the latter are laterally compressed in their

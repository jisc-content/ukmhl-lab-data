Reprinted from the " Olasgoio Medical Journal" for December, 1896.1 WESTERN INFIRMARY: NOTES OF CASES IN PROFESSOR BUCHANAN'S WARDS. By J. CRAWFORD RENTON, M.D. The following cases of interest have come under observation . and treatment from time to time in Prof. Buchanan's absence, and with his kind permission I record them:â€” Excision of Half the Tongue, A. B., admitted with a well-marked epithelial ulcer on the left lateral aspect of the tongue. Half the tongue removed by Whitehead's method. A silk ligature was passed round 1 the lingual artery before division, and the patient lost very 1 little blood. Whitehead's varnish was applied to the cut ; surface, and the wound healed well. The patient lived a year, ! and was killed when at his work by a fly-wheel. He was t quite well up to his death. C. D. was sent to the Infirmary by Dr. Easton, of Stranraer. ' The left half of his tongue was removed for the same cause as tthe above case, and he continued well for eighteen months. In another case the employment of Mr. Scott Riddell's t tongue-clamp enabled us to cut away the tongue with very 1 little bleeding, and I can recommend the use of it. Cranial Accidents. M. A., set. 4, was admitted, having fallen one storey, sus- jtainmg^a compound comminuted fracture of right parietal bone. The child was unconscious, the left eye being drawn inwards. Slight consciousness returned in two hours, but : patient remained with paralysis of left arm and leg and left ^ side of face. Ten hours after admission chloroform was given

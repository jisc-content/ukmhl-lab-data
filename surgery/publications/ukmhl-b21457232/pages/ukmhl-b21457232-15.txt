Whilst a certain number of them apparently force their way outwards between the cells of old endothelium at the bottom of the filled-in furrows, others, starting from the areolar bed, which separates the intima and the media, move inwards, passing, for the most part, through the alternate folds of endothelium dividing the furrows (fig. 3).

This brush-like top is, T consider, due first to the escape of the nucleus from an apical cell into the newly formed tissue beyond; secondly, to the subsequent passage of inward bound motile corpuscles along the same route.''

157 ENDARTERITIS PROLIFERENS. thrown by the contraction of its muscular coat were first filled and subsequently obliterated by the young cell formation. This is well shown in figure 4, where we can trace the original boundary-line of the renal arteriole as it appai-ently dives into the new tissues. The nuclei were unfortunately not stained in this section. We can, however, observe them in figure 3. Their arrangement is peculiar. Whilst those in the inner lining of the vessel are fortuitously dotted through the new Fig. 2b.-Transverse section of an cesophageal branch of aorta. Case of carci- noma of cardiac end of stomach. Zeiss B. tissues, a large number of the spindle-shaped nuclei in the outer endothelial layers are arranged with their long axes radially. From one or the other pole of the nuclear body we may, not rarely, see thread-like extensions, which pass oftentimes between two adjacent cells. In the inner and more irregularly shaped cells I have occasionally found two nuclear prolongations from one corpuscle. These highly stained filaments. I presume are merely pseudopodial extensions of the nuclear plasm. If' this

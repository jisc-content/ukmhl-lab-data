A catgut dram was inserted, bone partially replaced, and the wound closed. Convalescence was uninterrupted except for some slight twitchings of the mouth some days after operation, and three months after operation she continued well. Acute Intussusception. M W., set. 3 months, was sent to the Western Infirmary by Dr. Paterson, of Berkeley Terrace, with symptoms of intussus- ception which had existed for twenty-four hours. On examination under chloroform a distinct fulness and some swelling was found along the line of the transverse and descending colon, and per rectum a well-marked protrusion was telt. No influence was produced on this swelling by manipulation or injection, so the abdomen was opened; and with some difficulty 18 inches of intussuscepted bowel were drawn out and returned into the abdomen, and the wound closed. I he bowels acted six hours after, and recovery was uninterrupted. Removal of C^cum with Successful use of Murphy's Button. J. M., set. 30, had suffered for five years from fistula into the csecum with subsequent contraction. After various attempts at closure the csecum was removed and the ileum joined to the colon with Murphy's button. The patient did well, passing the button on the sixteenth day and is now quite well. I have pleasure in thanking Drs. Beatson, Burnside Buchanan, Walker, and Carstairs for much valuable help in the conduct of these cases. ^ OLASOOW : miNTKD BV ALB!?. MACDODOALL.

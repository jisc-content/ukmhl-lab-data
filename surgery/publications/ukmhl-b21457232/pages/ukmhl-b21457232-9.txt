ENDAKTEKITIS PROLIFEEENS. 155 through the circulation with others which have been admittedly exposed to contamination. I shall not tire the readers of the Joiornal with a description of the figure. It speaks for itself. (See fig. 1.) I shall, however, refer to it hereafter. The next illustration (fig. 2) represents a transverse section of an upper oesophageal branch of the aorta from a woman aged 69 years, who died of cancer, involving the cardiac end of the stomach. The portion shown in the figure was situated a few millimetres only from a very atheromatous aorta. There is no doubt about the extent or nature of the disease affecting the arterial coats in this figure. We can see the lumen of the L'ransverse section of popliteal artery, fcetus 6 months. The intima only is shown. Zeiss F. x 532-9. vessel is much diminished by endothelial cell proHferation, occur- ring mostly in the shape of rounded projections. These are separated from one another by deep indentations, which appear to extend almost to the muscular coat, and probably represent the longitudinal furrows, into which the intima is 'thrown by the contraction of its muscular ring. As, however, it will be more convenient to consider the histology of this disease with regard especially to the early stages of its growth and develop- ment, I pass on to the next illustration (fig. 3). This also depicts a cross-section of an oesophageal branch of the aorta.

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE 1G been given to them for that purpose. This important privi- lege, however, was unfortunately of no long continuance; and about four hundred and fifty years afterwards, we find the great Galen reduced to the old system of dissecting apes, and other animals as like to the human race as he could find, and felicitating himself on the amazing opportunity he once enjoyed of examining two human skeletons preserved at Alexandria. Then, further on, came the darkest of the dark ages, and the languishing days of feeble surgery; and it was not till about the middle of the sixteenth century, that Vesalius, giving birth to anatomy, properly so called, placed surgery on a solid basis; and at the same time rendering it a pursuit worthy of men of talents and education, gave our profession an impetus which has ever since been on the increase. What, then, history has proved to be most conducive, nay, essentially necessary, to the healthful and prosperous existence of surgery, and what the concurrent testimony of all authors and teachers of the present time declares to be still the only true foundation on which it call either rest or advance, let not the student dare to neglect. Let him be diligent in his ana- tomical research; and above all things, let him be much in the dissecting room. There he will become familiarly con- versant with the parts in a state of health, which he will afterwards have to heal and protect, when injured by violence or attacked by disease. It is not enough that he knows that such and such parts are; he must know, of his personal observation, where they are, and how they look, and how they feel, and what is their relative position one to the other. There, too, he will acquire “ the education of his fingers,” as it is called, necessary to surgical dexterity; for, as has been well remarked by Mr Liston, it is only when we have acquired dexterity on the dead subject, that we can be justified in interfering with the living. Whence, continues he, have arisen the doubts and uncertainties—the sleepless nights—the gene- ral failing of self-confidence, in those whom John Bell has described as “ agitated, miserable, trembling,” — whence but from unacquaintance with anatomy—practical anatomy ? And

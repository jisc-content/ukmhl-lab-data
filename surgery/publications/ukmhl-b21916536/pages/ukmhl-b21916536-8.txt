INTRODUCTORY LECTURE () none are so closely, so indissolubly allied, as surgery and medicine. It is necessary for us, however, in commencing an inquiry into one of these departments in particular, to separate them by an imaginary line of distinction ; simply because — however true it is, that you and I, in endeavouring to obtain a thorough knowledge of either, must study both with equal care and assiduity,—yet here it is proposed to teach surgery alone. Surgery, or Chirurgery, literally interpreting its definition, means handiwork, applied to the practice of the healing art: in other words, “ the manual procedure, by means of instru- ments or not, directed towards the repair of injury and the cure of disease; in contradistinction to the practice of medicine, denoting the treatment of disease by the administration of drugs, and other substances supposed to be of a sanative ten- dency.” Such a definition, doubtless, applied very justly to surgery in its infancy; and but too fully comprehended the duties of the surgeon, when his profession was sunk in the lowest depth of degradation during the dark ages. When, in the twelfth century, the Council of Tours forbade the priesthood to contaminate themselves with its practice, and denounced it as totally beneath the attention of any man of station or learn- ing— when, in consequence, it was left entirely in the hands of the ignorant and designing — when, at its expense, the learned physician had exalted himself into a proud philosopher, and his calling to a dignified branch of general science—when the uninformed surgeon was nothing better than a mechanic, and the abject servant of this proud man, — theti, indeed, poverty-stricken surgery could not complain that the strictest interpretation of the term, according to its definition, did not fully comprehend the details of the art. Itvvas a sad falling off from the better times that had gone before. The surgeon had not always been the degraded creature that the wiles of priestcraft and the shackles of ignorance had reduced him to. About two thousand and four hundred years before that famous, or rather infamous edict from Tours, flung shame and calumny on his head, the

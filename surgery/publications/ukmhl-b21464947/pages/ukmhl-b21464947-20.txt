18 INAUGURAL ADDRESS. one man and the devotion of one mind to its accomplishment. Some time before Jenner tiu-ned his attention to the subject, the learned and accomplished DrMead —the first London physician of his day—wrote of the utter hopelessness of the very idea of battling with and vanquishing such a formidable enemy to human life and happiness, as small-pox. He speaks of the possibility of a "specific antidote being found against the contagious poison" of smaU-pox—that is, an antidote "by which it may be so thoroughly destroyed, that though it had been received into the body, it may not produce the disease," as an idea as wild and chimerical as that of alchemy; and one, in his opinion, outragmg "the principles and elements of things that are so certain and so well estabUshed by the permanent laws of nature." ^ These disheartening opinions of Dr Mead regarding the hopelessness of ever gaining a prophylactic for smaU-pox, were pubHshed in 1747. Before, however, fifty years had elapsed, Jenner had both discovered, and successliilly adapted to practice, the great prophylactic measure that has rendered his name imperishable in the annals of the human race And thus the happy results of Jenner's labours,-besides their own mtrmsic and inestimable worth,-descend to us stamped with a precious lesson from lum ot hope and perseverance under alleged impossibilities; for these results preach loudly to the profession in all time to come, that we should never permit any apparent improbabiUties to prevent us from going always onwards m earnest search for possible means of conquering and curing diseases even of the most formidable and fatal kind. In conclusion, let me add one word more. I have hitherto spoken of asso- ciations of the profession, Uke that of the Medico-Chinn-gical Society, as principally calculated to advance medical observation amongst us, and to pro- mote the general extension of medical science. There is, however, another high and important advantage belonging to such associations as those formed by this Society,-another benefit flowing from their construction. _ For such associations are' not only destined to spread profes.onal -^1 and -foma among their constituent members; they are destined also to promote pro ferional goodwill and genuine brotherhood amongst them. They are in ended o cXva e the heart, as well as to cultivate the head;-to increase and deepen ■ our feeling of professional fraternity and kindness, as well as increase and Ind our^tores of professional acquirements knowledge. And d^^^^^^ time that I may have the pleasure and the honour of occupymg the Chair to Teh y u have^lect^^ shall ever en-avoi. to use my influence m^^^^^^^ That while every freedom is given to professional debate, there shall, ^Po^^^e te L l^g uttered that shalf unnecessarily hurt the feehngs of prSion, present or absent.

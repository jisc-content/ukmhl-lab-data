124 ON INJUUIES OF THE HEAD. portion of sense and volition will remain ; for example, when you are called to the bed-side of a person thus situated, you find him to be what is termed comatose. If you speak sharply to him, he becomes roused for the moment, mumbles some brief answer to you, again lays down, and relapses into his former sleepy state ; thus you observe partial mental faculties and voli- tion still remain. This state you should minutely note, as it will greatly assist you in your after diagnosis: and you must be upon your guard that you are not deceived here j for a man in this condition very much resembles one in a state of intoxication j and this similitude often proves exceedingly harassing to the surgeon. He is probably sent for to a person who, it is stated, has received a severe injury of the head. He finds him with a very severe laceration of the scalp, together with stupor, and sometimes even stertorous breathing. Not knowing that the individual was in- toxicated at the time of receiving the injury, the surgeon attri- butes the above symptoms to concussion or compression, -when, after a few hours, the person recovers from his drunken fit, and it becomes apparent that he has received no other mischief than a wound in the scalp. In addition to loss of sense and motion, the fsces involuntarily pass off, from the sphincter ani losing is retentive power through the sympathetic influence of the great sympathetic nerve—the voluntary power of the bladder becomes for the time extinct—the urine is retained, and you are obliged to pass a catheter for its removal at the very time when the escape of the feces cannot be controlled. But the involuntary functions of no organ are so soon affected by injuries of the brain as those of the stomach ; this arises from the connexion before explained to you : vomiting, therefore, is one of the first symptoms, though the feces pass in- voluntarily, yet there is such torpor of the intestinal canal, that purgatives will not easily excite action, and there will be found considerable difficulty in procuring evacuations; the pulse is said to beat laboriously; for the heart being affected, it cannot readily get rid of its contents. The pulse, however, is not slow, unless the body be at rest: for upon the slightest exertion it be- comes exceedingly quick ; the pupils are dilated, and there is sometimes bleeding from the nose, which, when the patient has been kept lying on his back, often occasions vomiting of blood ; when the injnry has extended to the basis of the skull, producing fracture there, it is generally attended with bleeding from the

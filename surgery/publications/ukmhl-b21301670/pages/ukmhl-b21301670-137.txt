125 ON INJUUIES OF THE HEAD. ears. These cases are very dangerous, and persons usually fall victims to them. It adition to the symptoms already enumerated^ there is often partial paralysis, or hemiplegia ; squinting is occa- sionally produced; the natural direction of one or both eyes be- coming changed; permanent, partial, or total aberration of the mental faculties may also be added to the consequences already enumerated, arising from injuries of the brain. When asked to explain the difference betvreen concussion and compression, you answer, concussion is simply a shock which the brain has received, more or less severe, attended with lacer- ation or not: and compression arises from either a depressed portion of bone, the extravasation of blood, or the formation of matter : and from whichever of these it springs, the symptoms will be the same. In describing the symptoms and treatment of these diseases more particularly, I will first begin with Concussion.' When called to a person whom you find in a state of stupefaction, but not to a great degree ; regular pulse, tranquil and regular breath- ing ; and the accident has existed some hours, you will generally be justified in pronouncing that the injury has been trifling ; but when the individual has been first seized with vomiting, is inca- pable of using any muscular power, from loss of nervous in- fluence ; a total aberration of the mental faculties, with intermit- tent pulse and breathing, these will be found the diagnostic symp- toms of severe injury, and the case a dangerous one. In simple concussion, where the derangement is not so extensive as that just described, and where the patient upon being spoken to, raises himself, as if awoke from a sound sleep, and where some power of vohtion still remains, you will find one of the best diagnostic symptoms to be the accelerated action of the pulse upon the pa- tient exerting himself; a man in this state with a pulse at 70, on being raised, or attempting to walk, will have it inordinately quickened, it will instantly beat 130 in a minute ; this is a never- failing symptom, and where the patient can be made to exert himself at all, will be found a sure characteristic of the disease. TTiere is also in these cases a greater action of the carotids than in health; they beat more violently, though not more quickly, if the patient be at rest; if asked what are the best marked symp- toms of concussion, I should say this increased motion of the carotids; the apparent tranquil sleep; the instantaneous relapse to that state after having been roused; the remarkable excitement

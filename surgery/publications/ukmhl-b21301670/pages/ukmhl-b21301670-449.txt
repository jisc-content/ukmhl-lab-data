ox THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. 437 latter, where the constitution becomes affected from some acci- dental circumstance. With respect to diseases of tlie ankle and knee joints, amputa- tion for such complaints will occasionally be necessary both of the leg and thigh j indeed, chronic affections of the ankle and knee give rise to amputation as frequently as diseases in any part of the body. For compound fractures we seldom amputate di- rectly ; they are seldom so severe as to require immediate am- putation, and it is not until gangrene or disease of the bone has taken place, that it is deemed necessary to amputate j compound fractures, however, from the superior manner in which they are now treated, do much better than formerly, and very severe in- juries of this description will often terminate inost favourably ; therefore, upon the whole, amputations are much less frequently performed at the present epoch than in the days of our ancestors. Now, gentlemen, before you amputate, it is necessary that you should apply, in such situations where it can be accomplished, the tourniquet, an instrument whicli consists of a strong band, capable of completely surrounding the thigh, two brass bridges, a long screw, a pad, and two small rollers. The rollers are situa- ted one at each end of the under bridge. The bridges lie in im- mediate contact with each other, the concave part of the upper bridge completely fitting the convex surface of the under. The pad is placed in the arch of tlie under bridge, and which pad is to be placed immediately upon the vessel whose circulation is to be stopped ; after having thus applied the pad, you are to bring the band around the limb, and secure it tightly upon the upper bridge, then, turning the screw by which the two bridges are connected, you can produce upon the vessel any degree of pres- sure that may be required, for the screw separatesone bridge from the other, thus raising the upper bridge, pressing upon the lower one, at the same time tightening the band, and forcing the pad upon the vessel, you effectually control the circulation of the blood in the limb to which the instrument is applied ; this is the tourniquet at present in general use ; another has lately been in- vented having small spikes at one extremity of the bridge, and these perforate the band after it has been tightly applied round the limb, when, upon turning the screw of this instrument, the same effect is produced as by the other. The tourniquet, in operations where it can be used, will be found of very great service; I mean, will be of considerable

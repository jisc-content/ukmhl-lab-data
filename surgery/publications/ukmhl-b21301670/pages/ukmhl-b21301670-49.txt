LOCAL treatment OT lA FLAMMATION, 37 table, that he had a few more remarks to make, hut these would he on another subject: viz., the occasional retraction of the skin of a stump after amputation.] A surgeon at Worthing took off a boy’s arm pretty near the shoulder joint; the stump healed kindly, and all was thought to he doing well: some months after, however, lie complained of pain, and the skin retracted to such an extent, that the bone projected through it at least an inch; in this state he came to town, and, upon examining the part near the arm-pit, I put my finger upon a small tumour; this occasioned the boy to jump as though he had been electrified. I'then performed the operation of amputation at the shoulder joint, and, upon examination, it was found that the tumour, which had been touched before the operation, and produced the electric shock, was a large ganglion of nerves, and it had given rise to the excessive irritability of the stump, and the retraction of the skin. Previously to the above case, a boy was sent to me with a stump similar to the one I have just described, but in the leg; the ends of the bones were cut off, and the boy left the hospital apparently well; but soon after the arm case from Worthing had been ope- rated upon, and the nature of the disease ascertained, this boy again returned, having his stump in a painful, irritable state, and •he skin evidently retracted. Knowing now the cause of the mischief, I cut down upon, and took out the end of the posterior tibial nerve : the bad symptoms consequently disappeared, and the lad eventually recovered. Going round the hospital the other day, I met with another case resembling the above, but, in point of irritability, much worse. At the particular request of the woman, I amputated : the nerves appeared to be enlarged, and formed a ganglion par- tially resting on the extremity of the bone; this had produced such a degree of irritation, that no part of the stump could be touched without exciting a kind of electric shock ; in fact, the woman appeared very much to resemble a sensitive plant. How the nerves become longer than the bones in these cases does not admit of easy explanation.

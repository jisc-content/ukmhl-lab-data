439 ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. pleasantly with the motion of the remaining fingers; do not there- fore, amputate a finger at the second or third joint, unless you are particularly requested to do so by the patient himself ; and as this request may be made, I will show you the mode of per- forming the operation. Amputation of the Pingeh at the Second on Third Joint. Having felt for the joint, you make a circular incision a little below it, through the integuments; this is the first step ; you then make a cut through these at each side of the joint; you then turn up and back the flaps thus produced, when, upon dividing the ligament with the scalpel at one side of the joint, you imme- diately open it, carry the knife through and div>ide the ligament on the opposite side ; in this way the finger may be removed ; the flaps you see are now laid over the bone, and form a good stump. The French perform this operation in a different mode, and in a way, I must say, not very anatomical; for you know the construction of the phalanges, is such that the upper portion of the lower bone projects over the articulating surface of the up- per; this happens both inside and outside the joint, so that if you attempt to cut directly into the joint, you cannot do so in those parti, for the point of your knife will rest upon the processes I have just mentioned to you : their mode is to bend the finger, and then make a cut into the joint behind the process, and this in a finger that is not diseased may be done ; but, generally speak- mg, in diseased fingers, the joints cannot be bent; it likewise often happens that the joints themselves are diseased, when, cf course, flexion would be exceedingly difficult, if not impos- sible. On Amfutation op the Finger at the Third Joint. Mow, gentlemen, in this amputation the finger is drawn aside; you then make an incision obliquely through the web situated be- tween them, and carry your cut just beyond the knuckle ; the knife is then carried through the joint from side to side, leaving a flap of integument sufficient to cover the end of the bone ; to say the truth, this is not the best mode of amputating the finger ; It is better to make your oblique cut through the web longer than I have just described to you, so as to carry it beyond the joint some way up the metacarpal bone ; you make a similar incision on the other side of the joint, and having cleared the bone from

ON DISEASES OF THE BREAST. 889 of even two years the Jisease often will not have reached any re- markable size. 1 have seen the skin covering fungus h.-cmatodes of a livid colour as early as the thirteenth week from the commence- ment of the disease, and ui five months I have known it destroy life; therefore I am fully justified in saying tiiat it is much more rapid in its progress than scirrhous tubercle ; for we find that it becomes in the course of a few months, of considerable bulk, having a livid surface, and afluctuating feel; this sense of fluctuation does in re- ality arise from a fluid; and which fluid, when discharged, has the appearance of coffee. It is composed of serum, the red particles of the blood, and bile ; that it is true serum is known by a portion of it coagulating on its admixture with the alkalis, muriatic and nitric acids, and from the application of heat; that there is bile in it is known by the yellow tint which it gives to white paper. I have at this time, in a bottle, some paper which was written upon with this fluid some years since, and the yellowness is per- fectly distinct up to the present period. Although the fluid contained in the cyst of fungus harmatodes is of so dark a colour, yet it is not of a malignant nature ; it sometimes is perfectly transparent, being much more clear than the serum of hydrocele, having in it less albumen, and more water; but most frequently the fluid is of a dark colour, resembling coffee, as 1 before stated to you, and composed of the red particles cf the blood, serum, and bile. Well, as the diseased action goes on, inflammation is ex- cited, and at length the cyst bursts ; nature attempts to relieve by exciting, in the parietes of the cyst, the adhesive process ■ but failing in this attempt, owing to a peculiarity of constitution, a fungus sprouts forth. Here (holding up a preparation) you see it shooting out in the manner described ; the edges of the cyst being everted, or turned away from the fungus. In a short time it becomes a considerable size, and the discharge from it cf really enormous; so great, indeed, tluit it will as completely wet a handkerchief, in the space of half an hour, as if it had been dipped in water ; and the smell of the discharge is often so disa- greeable, that the surgeon who has seen much of this disease will be acquainted with its character the moment he enters the patient’s room. Xow, gentlemen, this disease has a continued disposition to slough, and from that circumstance it occasionally receives a natural cure ; for instances have been known, where the entire tumour has sloughed, and the wound healed kindly, to the per-

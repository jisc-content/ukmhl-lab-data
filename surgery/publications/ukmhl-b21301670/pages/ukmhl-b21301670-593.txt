ox SYPHILIS AND THE USE OF MERCURY. 5Sl for example, excoriations may exist on the glans, to which syphi- litic matter may have been applied, and the poison may have entered into the constitution through the medium of those broken surfaces, without having time to produce in the sores themselves the true syphilitic character ; if, therefore, a patient were to come to you under such circumstances, and after having^had connexion with a suspicious person, if he were to inquire of you whether the sores were syphilitic or not, you had better explain to him what I have just stated to you; and likewise tell him, that although the ulcers have not then the syphilitic aspect, yet that he may in reality be infected, but that there has not been suffi- cient time for the parts to assume their peculiarly marked syphi- litic character ; tell him to make his mind easy, watch the ap- pearance of the parts, let him wait and see the result, without subjecting himself at all hazards to a course of mercury, for the cure of a disease which never required its employment. Mer- cury, itself, unfortunately produces diseases very similar, both in appearance and effect, to syphilis. I recollect, at the com- mencement of my studies at these hospitals, one day, on going round the wards with a surgeon, having been very much sur- prised to see mercury so indiscriminately employed, and at seeing every poor emaciated wretch continually rubbing in; there was one individual, I remember, in a dreadful state, who had been using mercury for a great length of time, and under which treat- ment he continued to get rather worse than better; in this case 1 took the liberty of suggesting the propriety of discontinuing the mercury, when, in a short time, the patient became completely cured. Mercury, in reality, when given injudiciously, or to excess, will sometimes produce ulcers, which a man of little ex- perience would say were venereal. Again, in ulcerated sore throats, a careless observer might mistake common ulcers for venereal ones; the former, however, are known to be superficial and may generally be removed by ordinary purgatives, whereas the latter are deep, with elevated edges, having the same appear- ance as chancres on the penis, I recollect a gentleman once coming to me, and standing before me as well as he could • "Pray, sir," said he. “what do you think is the matter with me?’ " What’’’ said I, “ why, you are poxed up to the eyes;’’ seeing him in such a state, this was my involuntary reply, not the most elegant, certainly. I told him that he was not then la a fit state to Ukc mercury, being emaciated, and in a stale

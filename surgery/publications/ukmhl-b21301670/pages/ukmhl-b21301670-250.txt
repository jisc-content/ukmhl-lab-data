238 ON HERNIA. nia; in umbilical hernia its action is most considerable : in in- guinal next. What I would do if I had strangulated hernia would be this : I would have the taxis employed steadily for ten or fifteen mi- nutes ; if this did not succeed, I would be bled to syncope, and then have the reduction by the hand attempted again; if this also proved unsucces^ul, I would have the tobacco injection, and wait a short time ; and then if necessary have the operation per- formed ; it is the most egregious ignorance possible to delay the opm^tion so long as is often done, thereby wasting those precious moments which, if properly used, might have been spent in saving the life of the patient; ask those about our hospitab, who are the persons who die from strangulated hernia 1 and they will tell you those who have the operation delayed three or four days after the hernia has been strangulated, and then, if operated on, they often die; the delay is the cause of the danger, and not the ope- ration. I have had a little personal experience of this complaint and have devoted no small share of my attention to it, and I would not wait more than twelve hours, if the tobacco enema and other means had been employed. Now let me allude to the case of a late illustrious nobleman— I am now almost afraid to mention names—who died of this dis- ease ; he was in the country, and during his stay there, had stran- gulated hernia; he was attended by a person of strong mind, and who had studied his profession with industry; he offered to per- form the operation, but it was delayed, on the ground that Lon- don skill and advice should be obtained; but before this could be had, the nobleman died: I do not mean to under-value Lon- don skill, but it certainly is great folly to delay in this complaint. I would propose the operation, and perform it readily if it was agreed to ; but if not, I would wash my hands of the affair, and be freed from its consequences. LECTURE XXVIII. Direct Inguinal Hernia. Our principal object, in this evening’s lecture, will be to describe to you the operation for strangulated inguinal hernia, and to show you on the dead subject, the manner of performing tliat ope- ration. Before I state to you, however, the best method of per-

ON CUANCllE. 513 LECTURE LXr. CflANâ€™CnE. There are two poisons, as I mentioned to you before, communi- cated by venereal intercourse ; one the poison of gonorrhoea, which, falling on a mucous surface, produces from that surface a discharge of matter which is infectious ; the other, the poison of syphilis, which, applied to the skin, or, as far as is known at present, to any surface, produces inflammaUon and ulceration, forming a sore called chancre ; which, being received into tne glands of the groin, occasions bubo, and being conveyed into the system, circulates with the blood, produces ulceration on differ- ent parts of the body, on the mucous membrane of the throat, the skin, the periosteum, and bones. The time at which the effect of the poison that produces chancre, makes its appearance, is uncertain ; the chancre, how- ever, generally appears three or four days after connexion, and from four to seven days is the average time. The poison first produces inflammation, then ulceration ; the inflammation is at- tended by a pimple arising from the surface affected, which is like a common pimple, excepting that it is of a deeper colour; in- stead of being quite florid, it is of a darker hue. The pimple is surrounded by a kind of erysipelatous inflammation ; an ulcer forms in the centre, and then a pit forms in the body of the sore, which is often of considerable magnitude, and extends beneath the skin. The surrounding edges of the sore are hard and rag- ged, its surface is yellow, and the margin red ; and, if you were asked if a sore was a chancre or not, you would answer, I must feel it first, and not decide merely by looking at it. You would then lift up the part between your fingers; and, if you found a hardness beneath, this would be a very good criterion of its being a syphilitic sore ; for it is neither in the ulceration, nor in the yellowness of the surface, nor the raggedness of the edges, but in the colour and hardness of the sore, that the characteristic marks of the chancre manifest themselves ; from the presence of these, you form an opinion, and are enabled to say positively if the sore be a chancre. But, gentlemen, if you ask me whether it is pos- sible to determine that a sore on the penis is not chancre, I should tell you, that I believe it impossible for any man positively to say that it is not; chancre varies exceedingly in its appearance In

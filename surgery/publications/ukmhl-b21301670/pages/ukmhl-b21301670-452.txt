ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. 440 itB muscular and ligamentous attachments, you saw through the metacarpal bone itself. The two fingers which were next the diseased one, now ap- proximate, and if kept in this situation until adhesion of the in- teguments has taken place, very little deformity of the hand will be produced : if, on the other hand, a portion of the finger be left projecting, the inconvenience of the stump will not only be felt in the motion of the fingers, but a disagreeable deformity be obvious to every spectator; in the opieration I have just shewn you, neither one nor the other will exist, comparatively speaking; there cannot be, of course, any annoyance from a stump, and the deformity will be scarcely observable: well then, we seldom amputate the finger at the second or third joint, unless at the par- ticular desire of the patient: neither do we recommend the ope- ration at the first joint, but rather the one which I have just men- tioned, to you, that of sawing through the metacarpal bone a little way above the knuckle. The next operation that I shall describe to you is the Amputation of the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb. To accomplish this operation, yon must begin your incision by cutting through the integuments at the inside of the thumb, near- ly opposite the first joint; you carry this incision backwards to the union of the metacarpal with the carpal bones; this incision will form a flap, consisting of integuments and the abductor mus- cles, quite sufficient to cover the wound that will be occasioned by the operation. After having completed this flap, the knife is then to be passed backward from between the index finger and thumb as far as the trapezium, to which bone the head of the me- tacarpal bone is articulated ; when you arrive at this position, you are to turn the knife so as to make its blade form a right angle with the incision just made; you are then to carry its edge through the joint, by which the ligaments will be divided, and the bone is thus removed : the flap, you observe, that I first left, and which is formed principally of the abductor pollicis and the integuments is quite sufficient to cover the wound. The meta- carpal bone of the little finger is removed by nearly a similar operation. You begin your incision at the web between it and the ring finger ; carry down to the articulation with the unci- forme bone, pass it through the joint, and then let it terminate Upon the outside of the metaearpal bone, opposite the part where

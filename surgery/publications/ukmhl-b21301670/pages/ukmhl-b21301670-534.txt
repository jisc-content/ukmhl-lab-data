522 inflammation of the prostate gland. pain, he will tell you that he can ; such doings and replies as Ihese you will not obtain from a patient having stone. At length the enlargement of the prostate, in many cases, will proceed until it occasions complete retention of urine; this, however, may be the effect of retaining more urine in the blad- der, and for a longer period, than it ought; or it may have been the result of checked perspiration, either from cold weather, or from having imprudently laid aside some flannel covering ; when the retention has been brought about by either of these latter mentioned causes, in conjunction with an enlarged prostate, ex- citing on such persons a copious perspiration, will often afford relief. When you inti oduce a catheter into the bladder of a patient having chronic enlargement of the prostate, you will find the urine of a very high colour, and of an exceedingly offensive smell. Well, then, such are the symptoms which accompany this kind of enlargement of the prostate gland ; at least, they are such as I witness. Upon dissection of those who have died of this disease (and, without dissection, we know nothing at aH of the matter), the prostate is found enlai'ged sometimes laterally, but most frequently the enlargement is in the posterior part, si- tuated in the middle, or third lobe. Well, as the prostate enlarges, it is pushed forward; in consequence of which the urethra be- comes curved immediately before the apex of the prostate; indeed, the coming forward of the prostate causes the urethra almost to double upon itself; the curve thus formed, is at the symphysis pubis ; and it is in this situation that the difficulty on passing the catheter in diseased prostate is found. Tracing on the course of the urethra behind the curved part, that canal is seen much en- larged ; the next thing we notice is, that the urethra itself is considerably elongated, that is, from an inch and a half to two inches ; which increase of length is behind the pubes, and it is owing to this circumstance that you are under the necessity of carrying on the catheter so great a distance after its point has passed the arch of the pubes. W ell, then, as to the prostate itself, we find that it may increase to a most enormous size late- rally, without giving rise to retention of urine. But that enlarge- ment which occurs posteriorly in the third lobe (and which you have an opportunity of observing in the preparation now pas>ing round the theatre), frequently occasions retention of urine, for the enlargemen is situated immediately behind the orifice of the

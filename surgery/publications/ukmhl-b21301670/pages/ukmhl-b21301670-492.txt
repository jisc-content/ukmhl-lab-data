ON POISONS. 480 fever had been sown more than two months before the symptoms were apparent. Those persons who have had ague, and who are subsequently assailed by fevers, or even the slight fever attending a cold, will have it assume a typhoid character ; what I mean is, that fevers in those individuals who have had ague will generally be of a typhoid nature. I will now speak more particularly of Animal Poisons. The Wasp and the Hornet.—The sting of the wasp and the hornet gives rise in many cases, to very great pain and severe inflammation. The best application to mitigate the effects of those stings, is composed of one drachm of opium rubbed down in an ounce of oil: p-it some of this on lint, and lay it over the wound, occasionally changing it; at the same time you should keep the bowels open by apparientmedicines. The poison com- municated by The Bite of the Viper not unfrequcnily proves destructive to life ; it has both a nervous and arterial influence. A gentleman who was once in company with me on a shooting excursion, upon seeing a viper on the side of a bank, struck it with the butt-end of his gun, and supposing that he had killed it, put his hand towards it, for the purpose of taking it up ; the reptile, however, was not dead, but had merely formed itself into a coil, and sprang upon the gentleman’s finger ; he instantly sucked the wound, and shortly afterwards his tongue became paralyzed, and for a time the faculty of speech was entirely lost; this clearly shews that the poison of the viper has a direct influence upon the nerves, and that it affects the vascular system is also equally evident, for, in the case of this gentleman, the inflammation of the finger was very great, and extended up the arm even to the shoulder : by taking aperient medicines, and the application of poultices, this gentleman ultimately recovered. There was a man some time since admitted into this hospital in consequence of the bite of a viper ; the power of speech in this patient had but imperfectly returned; after a lapse of six months from the infliction of the injury. When I was formerly trying some e.\periments in comparative anatomy, I was anxious to see what effects were produced upon living structure by the poison of vipers; and, with a view of ascertaining, I confined

ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. 438 Utility to the operator in point of facilitating the operation, and at the same time rendering it more safe. As an auxiliary, however, its convenience will be much more felt in private than in hospital practice, for in the former there is commonly a deficiency of those able assistants, whom we so generally meet with in the latter; yet the tourniquet, when it can be ap- plied, will more effectually control the circulation than pressure by the hand. I will now show you where the tourniquet should "be applied when we operate on the upper extremity : for example, if you amputate the arm above the elbow it should be fixed as near as possible to the axilla, this will afford you room for dissecting back the integuments, and, at the same time, will allow of the retraction of the muscles. If you amputate below the elbow, the instrument should be applied about the middle of the arm, and this is the best place for putting it, on account of the pressure acting more immediately upon the vessel in this situation than when applied higher up, for here nothing but integuments and cellular membrane at the inner edge of the biceps muscle covers the artery; therefore, if you operate below the elbow, let the tourniquet be applied on the middle of the arm ; if above the elbow, not lower than one-third of the length of the arm down- wards. . When you amputate below the knee you should fix the instru- ment on the middle of the thigh, with the pad on the femoral artery, at the inner side of the sartorius muscle ; if you amputate above the knee, you must then fix it one-third the length of the limb downwards; the reason of your applying it so high up is, to allow of the retraction of the muscles, as I before stated to you with regard to the arm, but its necessity is much greater here, as I shall hereafter explain to you. Well, then, in ampu- tation of the upper extremity, the pad is placed at the in- side of the biceps, and in amputation of the lower extremity, if below the knee, near the middle of the thigh, at the inner edge of the sartorius muscle. The first amputations I shall show you will be those of the fingers ; we now very rarely amputate at either the second or third joint of the finger, because we find that it is better to remove the entire finger, either at the first joint, or even at the metacarpal bone behind the first joint, than to leave a small portion of the finger before it; for the stump is found to be extremely inconvenient, and to interfere most un-

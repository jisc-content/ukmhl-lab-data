353 OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. the most lamentable and fatal consequences ensued ; for the ope- rator lays hold of the stone, bladder and all, the forceps slip, ho lays hold of the stone again enclosed in the bladder in the same manner, and thus continues to pull, bruise, and draw the bladder, till at length the patient is carried back to his bed without the extraction of the stone. Violent inflammation supervenes from the violent bruising which the bladder receives, and in a few day* the person is no more. This untoward circumstance may be easily avoided, if you will be always sufficiently guarded to cut with your knife into the groove of theslafT, then put your index finger nail into the groove, and keep it there until you feel its situation occupied by the beak of the gor- get ; be sure not to withdraw your finger until you are satisfied of this fact. Well, having placed the beak of the gorget in the groove, take hold of the handle of the staff in your left hand, and bring it towards you ; at the same time depress the staff so as to keep it decidedly within the bladder; when you bring forward and de- press the handle of the staff, that is the moment for thrusting in the gorget, and this should be done in a direction upwards. Hav- ing satisfied yourselves ihat the gorget is in the bladder, with- draw the staff, and then along the hollow of the gorget introduca the forceps ; be particularly cautious when you are introduc- ing the forceps not to let the gorget recede, and so get out of the bladder; this frequently happens, and 1 will presently tell in what manner : it is a very awkward accident, and often leads to a gre.at deal of difficulty in completing the latter part of the operation. I will now explain the mode in which it takes place. When the gorget is in the bladder, and you attempt to pass the forceps a- long its concave surface, their point becomes opposed by the pros- tate gland, and in using a little requisite force to get them into the bladder, if you are not very careful, the gorget will be with- drawn ; the forceps, consequently, will not enter the bladder, and the stone, together with the bladder, will be embraced by the blades of the forceps in the distressing manner just now explained to you. If, upon introducing the gorget, considerable hemorrhage should arise, after the stone has been extracted, it may be checked, and entirely stopped, by keeping the patient cool, and by plugging the wound with sponge or lint; while there is any bleeding it would be highly impolitic to place the person in a warm bed, as the increased temperature would necessarily aug- 2 A

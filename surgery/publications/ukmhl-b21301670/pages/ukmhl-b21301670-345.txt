ON CALCULI IN THE URETER. 333 lyermatic plexus, the cremaster will be spasmodically con- tacted, and there will be felt severe paiu in the testicle ; the stomach will likewise be particularly irritable, and continually eject its contents ; the skin covered with cold sweats, with a death-like paleness of the countenance j the pain is not constant, but comes on at intervals ; after continuing for some minutes, a complete remission occurs, aud you therefore suspect that the stone has passed j after a lapse, however, of ten or fifteen minutes, it returns with as much severity as before. I have known an instance in which the violence of the pain was so great from a calculus in the ureter, that the patient absolutely laid down on the ground, and rolled about, so intense was the agony, and though not more than a quarter of a mile from his residence, he was under the necessity of bqing carried to his house by the servants.

OV DISEASES OF THE BREAST. S93 should be rendered wretched in consequence of the existance of such a tumour, an incision will instantly enable you to remove it, and thereby'allay all mental irritation : but as far as the tumour is itself concerned, and as regards the health or safety of the pa- tient, the operation is by no means necessary ; the size of the tumour is generally from that of a filbert or walnut to that of a billiard ball. Here are some pieparations (giving them to the students) in which you can see their general size and character ; here, however, is one of very considerable magnitude ; it ap- peared that the general health of the woman from whom this tumour was taken, was very little affected ; she felt pain in the tumour at the menstruating period, but there was no broken state of constitution, or general debility. The causes of these are usually obscure; it is difficult to say what gives rise to them, but I believe a frequent cause may be traced to the pressure produced by the whalebone and steel busks usually worn in stays. Treatment.—I do not find that medical treatment has any in- fluence upon these tumours ; you may, however, for the pur- pose of correcting the state of the constitution, should any thing amiss exist in it, give the hydrargyrus cum creta, or Plummer’s pill, together with soda and rhubarb ; these medicines, what- ever they may accomplish towards preventing the growth of the tumour, certainly will not disperse it when once formed ; at all events, if you do not try medicines, you cannot relieve by them : in the use of mercury, however, be particularly careful not to push it too far, for should you do so, the remedy will prove much more dangerous than the disease ; and it is likewise a hazardous experiment to administer mercury to young people who are ex- posed to the vicissitudes of our climate. The worst that can hap. pen is the removal of the tumour by the knife ; an operation which is not attended with the least danger, and always succeeds in affording permanent relief, for the disease does not return. The vessels which supply these tumours are by no means large. I re- collect on one occasion, however, when a surgeon was removing one of them from a woman’s breast in the other hospital, that upon separating the base of the tumour from its attachment, so violent a gush of blood took place, as for the moment com- pletely to appal the surgeon, and induce him to believe the knife had penetrated the patient’s heart; subsequently it was disco- vered that one unusually large vessel, which supplied the tumour

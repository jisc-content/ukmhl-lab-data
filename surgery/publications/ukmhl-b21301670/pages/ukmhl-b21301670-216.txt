ON TIlE CUKE OF HYDROCELE. 204 absorption ; 2dly, adhesion; 3dly, granulation. Now I ob- served to you in the last lecture that when hydrocele is pro- duct d in the common way, medicine or local applications have hardly any influence on it j when it arises from a relaxed state of the vessels, stimulating medicines and blisters have no ef- fect on the complaint. But I also stated on a former evening that hydrocele is produced by an inflammatory state of the parts, and that in these cases absorption by stimulating lotions should be promoted. I will now further add, that in young persons and children, who are not unfrequently subject to this affection, cure by absorption alone is effected, that is, by giving the hydrargyri submurias, scammony, rhubarb, and other medicines, so as to dispose the constitution to absorb. The liquor ammonias acetatis and ammonias murias are the local applications generally made use of to promote absorption in the parts, and what we do to facilitate the operation of these remedies is, to have a bag or suspensory truss to hold the scrotum, and this is fastened by two tapes round the abdomen, just below the umbilicus, and kept constantly wet with those fluids, in order to stimulate the absor- bents ; therefore be on your guard about performing an opera- tion for hydrocele in young persons, as the cure can be effected by absorption alone ; there are a few exceptions, however, to this rule, but they are exceedingly rare, as in almost every case of hydrocele in young persons or children, the water will be absorbed. With respect to the adhesion of the tunica vaginalis in the cure of hydrocele, this is effected in three ways ; by injection, seton, or incision; but the use of injections does not always produce adhesion of the tunica vaginalis; here is a specimen (pointing to one on the table), which was taken from a captain of a shin one morning, on whom I performed the operation for hydrocele by injection, by which he was relieved of every symptom of the complaint; several years after this he was taken extremely ill, and I was consulted by his attendant surgeon ; he was dying of some organic affection ; I desired the surgeon to remove the testicle and tunica vaginalis from the side on which the operation had been performed, as soon as the patient was dead, which was done ; on examination it was found that the tunica vaginalis did not adhere completely, there were a few adhesions in some parts but not generally ; the injection did

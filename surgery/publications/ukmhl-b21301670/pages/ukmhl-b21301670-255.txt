ON IIEUNIA. 243 part which you are so anxious to see distinctly. The better plan is, to take a tenaculum, and secure the two ends of the artery, by which means you will be able to have a good view of the different parts during the remaiuder of the operation. Having secured the vessel, you scratch through the fascia of the cord, just befow the ring, with considerable care, sepa- rating It from the cremaster muscle ; a small opening being made, you introduce a director upwards to the abdominal ring, and in- feriorly to the lower part of the swelling, and divide the fascia more or less, as may be required ; the next parts that will be brought into view are the fibres of the cremaster muscle, passing obliquely from above downwards; this covering is of consider- able density, and must be opened with care ; a director is to be introduced under it, in the same way as the fascia of the cord, and then it is to be divided ; as soon as this is done the hernial sac becomes exposed; it is of a blue appearance, and semi-trans- parent, from the fluid it contains ; so the character of the sac is quite different from that, of the coverings, and the one may be easily distinguished from the other. Having laid bare the sac, you pinch-it between your fingers, and feel distinctly the intestine and omentum within it; in rubbing the hernial sac between the fingers, do not use any force, as this is exceedingly dangerous ; well, when you have raised the sac so as to separate it from its contents, take the knife and make a small cut into it, not down- wards, but in a lateral direction ; place the instrument horizontal- ly, so as to avoid the danger of wounding the intestine, a danger to which you would be exposed if you cut downwaids. As soon as an opening is made, water generally escapes, if intestine be in- cluded in the sac, and there are no adhesions. Having opened the hernial sac, a director is to be introduced as far as the abdominal ring, and then it is to be divided up to that extent; the director is then to be carried to the lower part of the sac in the same way. When both omentum and intestine are in the sac, the omentum will be found before and the intestine behind ; there will also be a small portion of omentum at the upper part. After having opened the hernial sac the great difficulty commences ; you are next to feel for the stricture ; put your finger (and the little one is best for the purpose) into the hernial sac, and ascertain if the stricture is situated in the abdominal ring â€¢ and if it is, what you have to do is, to spread the omentum on the fore part of the intestine, like an apron, so as to cover it entirely ; bv n

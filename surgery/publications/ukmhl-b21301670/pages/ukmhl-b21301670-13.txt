LECTURES ON SURGERY. Introductory Lecture. Gentlemen.â€”While it is the province of the physician to attend ?o internal diseases, it is the duty of the surgeon to attend to those that are external; to perform operations for the removal of dis- eased parts; and to know how to regulate the system by the use of meicine, when local diseases are produced by constitutional derangement. Surgery is usually divided into the principles and practice. The first are learned from observations on the living when diseased, by dissection of the dead, and by experiments on living animals. Our deductions from these sources furnish us with the means of knowing a malady by its symptoms, the alter- ation of structure in a part when diseased, and the various ways in which Nature attempts the reparative process, both in external and internal parts. A man who has seen much of morbid pre- parations possesses great advantages ; but his anatomical know- ledge cannot be perfect unless he has frequently seen and assisted in the dissection of the human body. In the surgical science, hypothesis should be entirely discarded, and sound theory, de- rived from actual observation and experience, alone encouraged. The first is an ignus fatuus, which is sure to mislead ; the last a polar star, a never-failing guide. Experiments on living animals have been found of the greatest utility in directing us to a know- ledge-of the means by which Nature acts in the reparation of injuries, and in the restoration of lost parks. Thus the method she would adopt in uniting a fracture in the bone of a dog, will show you the manner in which union of a fractured bone would be effected in man ; the secretion of ossific matter by the blood- vessels being in each case precisrdy the same. ^ In the practice of surgery, also, many essential qualities are u

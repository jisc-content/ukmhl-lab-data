ON POISOVS. 476 these poisons, have been said, upon examination after death, to have had inflammation of the inner coat of the stomach, because in some instances the vessels have been found larger and more filled with blood than in others. These appearances, however, are common in cases of sudden death, where there has been merely congestion of the vessels of the stomach. These appearances are not the effect of inflammation, they have nothing of the character of inflamed mucous membranes, and are en- tirely destitute of that vivid redness wliich ever accompanies the latter. No; the influence of vegetable poisons is directly on the nerves ; and, in the next lecture, 1 will shew you a curious ex- periment with one of these poisons, when you will have an op- portunity of seeing an animal taking food almost at the very moment of its death ; the dissolution of the animal will occur in a very few minutes after the introduction of the poison under the skin ; so that the shortness of the time in which the effect is pro- duced, will shew the impossibility of its having been the result of inflammation. Thus, gentlemen, will vegetable poisons destroy life by direct influence on the nervous system, without giving rise to the slightest inflammation. Mineral poisons destroy, some by arterial, and some by nervous influence; but those which are most commonly taken, are arsenic, muriate of barytes, and oxy- muriate of mercury, and each of these produces violent inflam- mation. With regard to arsenic, it has a direct influence on the nerves as well; and all of you must have seen it produce the most powerful convulsions immediately after it has been taken. In those who have been destroyed by lead, no appearance of in- flammation has been found in any part of the body, no such mark either in the stomach, or any portion of the intestinal canal; the inner coat of the stomach in many of these cases appearing less vascular than usual, which evidently proves that death is not produced by inflammation in this part, but that it is the result of a direct influence of the poison upon the nerves. The action of morbid poisons are various, some being on the arteries, some on the nerves; in typhus fever, more commonly called gaol fever, (which arises from the number of persons crowded together rendering the air impure, and unfit to sustain the vigorous actions of life,) the first effects manifest themselves in the nervous system, producing great depression of the mental and bodily powers, through which, ulUmately, the persons are

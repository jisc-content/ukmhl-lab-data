526 INFUVMMATION OF THE niOHTATE CLAMi. ing an elastic gum catheter, the removal of the stilotte will some- times cauee it to enter with ease, when it would not previously pass at all. If it be deemed reiiuisite to leave the catheter in the bladder, 1 sliould prefer one of pewter rather than elastic gum, for it can bo curved down before the scrotum, and, by plugging up the end, the patient may move about as he likes, and, at any time he wishes, can expel his unne. Thus the in- strument becomes productive of great comfort. Let me observe to you, that if you employ a pewter catheter, it should be quite new, and ought not to be worn for a longer period than a fort- night, for the urine acts upon the metal, renders it brittle, and may probably cause the instrument to snap, if the time be extend- ed beyond what I have staled. I just now mentioned to you, in reference to young persons having enlarged prostate, that a boy was admitted into the other hospital, having symptoms of Slone, in consequence of which he was sounded, and the operation of lithotomy was about to be performed : the sounding, however, brought on inflammation of the bladder, which terminated in the boy's death ; upon dissection, it was found that the symptoms for which he had been sounded, were produced by an enlarged prostate gland. 1 have one other observation to make: persons will come to you for some supposed complaint in the bladder, and, upon inquiry, they will tell you, that they can pass their urine; now, if the di-ease consists of enlarged prostate, some urine will still remain ; desire them, tlrerefore, to make water, and then introduce the catheter : if the case bo one of enlarged prostate, you will be able to draw off from half a pint to a pint of urine, having a strong ammoniacal smell. A gentleman, about six weeks since, called upon me, whose case was similar to what 1 have just stated :â€”on inquiry as to whether he had passed his urine, he told me he had just done so; upon introducing the ca- theter, I drew from his bladder a pint of urine, having a highly offensive ammoniacal smell. You have only to teach a patient who is thus circumstanced howto introduce the catheter for him- self, and his danger will be at an end. The last circumstance connected with tne prostate which I have to mention to you, is that you will sometimes find Fungous Polypi growing from its base Here is a preinu'alion, in which you have

ON TIC DOULOUREUX. 473 » hen the pain absolntely was so severe, that it caused the person to roll out of bed, and fall on the floor at the time of our being in the room. It is in general like the pain of electricity—patients will ex- clami, “ Oh! I had a shock at that moment.” It produces a kind of flickering tiu-ough the nerves ; its motions are like sum- mer lightning, and the pain cannot be compared to any thing more appropriate than to the horrid sensations created by elec- tric shocks. Treatment of Tic Douloureux.—The principal relief has hitherto been derived from operations, and these operations have con- sisted in dividing some of the nerves of the face ; 'the division of the diseased branch will, at least genera lly, succeed in keeping off the pain for the space of three or four months, about which time it appears that the nerve either re-unites, or that its branches anastomose with others. If you ask patients if they will submit to an operation, they answer, ‘ ‘most certainly—to any thing that will rid us of our present suffering.” If they enquire of you whether the operation will be attended with permanent be- nefit, yon should say that it is doubtful, but you rather think noL Indeed, the result of the operation is doubtful enough, for the pam will sometimes return almost immediately, but whether by the same nerve is questionable, A person came several times from Bury to undergo the operation, and the pain used to return be- fore sensation ; that is, a numbness of a part of the cheek and upper lip would still continue, notwithstanding the pain was as severe as ever; the divided nerve in this case was th6 sub-orbitar ; well then, the division of the nerve does not always succeed in giving relief so long as one might have expected. If it should be deemed requisite to divide the sub-orbitar nerve, it should be done a quarter of an inch below the orbit; the nerve passes out of the foramen half an inch below, so that you are to divide it mid-way between the foramen and the edge of the orbit—if you divide it lower than this, you will leave some branches which will still continue the disease; the proper mode to adopt for dividing it is to introduce a sharp-pointed bistoury at the distance from the orbit already stated, and, carrying the point of the instrument close upon the bone, you hook up the nerve on its edge, then press upon the skin over the edge with your finger, and at tlie same time withdraw the knife through the opening by which it entered ; in this way a' you take out the knife the nerve will he

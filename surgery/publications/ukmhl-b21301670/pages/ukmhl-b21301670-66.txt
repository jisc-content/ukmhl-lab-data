ON SUPPUUATION 54 Wounds made into joints are always dangerous; this has been said to arise from the admission of air. No name can be given to such a declaration but ignorant nonsense; for air has no power whatever of producing inflammation in these cavities, and he who says otherwise knows nothing about it; the synovial membrane lining joints is a mucous membrane, and, therefore, quickly passes into the suppurative inflamma- tion, which circumstance renders an injury done to these parts exceedingly difficult to cure ; besides, the internal surfaces of joints are much more extensive than you would imagine; you would be astonished, if you saw the internal surface of the knee-joint spread out on this table. Joints are also composed of materials having in themselves very little restorative power, being formed of ligament, cartilage, and bone, parts that soon inflame, suppurate, and become absorbed. Whenever, there- fore, you are called to accidents of joints, and where openings have been made into them, these you should endeavour to close as speedily as possible. Likewise, when you have to re- move from these cavities extraneous bodies, you should draw the skin forcibly on one side, and then cut through it down upon the substance. If the operation be performed in this manner, the skin being left to itself will return to its natural situation ; consequently the cut in the integuments and that in the capsular ligament will not be opposite each other, and union by the first intention will be much more likely to ensue. In the treatment of wounds of the thecae as much caution is necessary as in those of the joints; their structure, in fact, nearly resembles the capsular ligament and synovial mem- brane : an injury here causes, in a very short time, great pain and inflammation, and much constitutional irritation and fever. If matter form, it becomes deposited, or locked up, as it were, in a tendinous bag; and so great is the irritation which it some- times occasions, that it has been known to destroy life in sixty hours. Case.—A young gentleman from the \\ est Indies, of great professional merit, of the name of Alcock, informed me one Monday night, after a surgical lecture, that he had, in the course of that day, punctured the theca in some part of his hand—as he was living at the time in the house of the late Dr. Haighton, I advised him to show it to the Doctor (who was an exceedingly clever man); he did so;—on the follow- ing day he suffered greatly from constitutional irritation, and on the Wednesday morning he died : his system was certainly a

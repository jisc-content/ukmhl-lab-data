When necessary, the supra-orbitar branch is to be di- vided in a similar manner, by introducing the knife under the integuments of the superciliary ridge, and cut through the nerve immediately as it emerges from the supra-orbitar foramen, carry the point of the knife from the nose outwards. When the submental nerve requires division, you need not make any incision through the integuments, but may perform the operation by placing the knife within the mouth, and directing its point downwards, to the mental foramen, where the nerve passes out, and by gliding the knife along the bone at that part, the nerve is sure to be divided ; in performing this operation, you may direct your knife by the bicuspidati teeth the anterior maxillary foramina being just below them.

I may here remark, it is much to be regretted that country practitioners do not more frequently publish the result of their observations and experience; much valuable knowledge is lost to the world from their neglect of this important duty. In speaking of the carbonate of iron, and of medicine in general, when given for the cure of tic douloureux, it cannot, of course, succeed, should the disease be otherwise than func- tional ; if it should be caused, as in the case of Dr. Pemberton, for example, (who suffered more, probably, than any other human being from this malady,) by a piece of bone projecting into the brain, medicines will prove utterly unavailing as regards cure ; and temporary ease Is all that can be afforded. five minutes more, gentlemen, and I have done.

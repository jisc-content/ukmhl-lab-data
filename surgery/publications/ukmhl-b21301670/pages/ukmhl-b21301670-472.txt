GELATINOUS POLYPUS. <i60 age of puberty, I shall proceed with the subject of polypi in the ensuing lecture. LECTURE LIT. first subject for our consideration this evening will be PoLYPr OF THE NoSE. There are four different species of nasal polypi, the first and most common of which is the Gelaiinous Poi.ypus. Polypi of this description grow from a narrow peduncle, are composed of a very soft substance, resembling jelly (hence their name), and are veiy slightly vascular; the second kind is the Hydatid Polypi. Tliese are formed by a collection of hydatids, and have the ap- pearance of bags or bladders of water ; with these there is gene- rally a copious serous discharge ^ the third are the Carcinomatous Polypi. These have similar symptoms and appearances to scirrhous tu- mours in other parts of the body, are painful at intervals, ulcer- ate, and,, during this stage, occasionally bleed; the fourth and last kind is the Fungoid Polypus. These are the four different species of polypi of the nose. Now, gentlemen, I shall first describe to you the Gelatinous Polypus. It is yellow and semi-transparent, very thinly streaked with vessels which are never sufficient to give it a red appearance. It hangs from the schneiderean membrane by a small peduncle, therefore loose in the nose, and if you stand opposite the pa- tient, and he draws in and forces out his breath through the nostrils, you will then be enabled to see it advance, and again retreat to the posterior nares. The large size of the polypus, however, will often prevent this free motion. It generally has its origin in the middle chamber of the nose, between the supe- rior and inferior turbinated bones. Here is a preparation (show- ing it to the class) in which you see it growing from the side of the antrum. Polypi of the nose of this description often acquire a very

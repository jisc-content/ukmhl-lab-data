ON BLEEDING OE THE URETHRA. 531 f night, when the patient is warm in bed ; and one ingenious gen- tleman, with a view to keep the parts cool, invented a tube to pass between the legs, under the clothes, to the outside of the bed, for the purpose of admitting a cunent of cold air. The Treatment consists in the application of poultices, fomentations, and leeches. During the night the penis may be enveloped with linen, wetted with the lotion plumb, subacet. Evaporating lotions may also be employed; the best medicine that you can give is thus formed : R. Liquor, potass, m. xx. ' Extr. conii. gr. iij. Mist, camph. 5x.

It sometimes occurs from iJie rup- ture of a vessel during inflammation : at other times, and more frequently so, it is caused by the introduction of a catheter or bougie.

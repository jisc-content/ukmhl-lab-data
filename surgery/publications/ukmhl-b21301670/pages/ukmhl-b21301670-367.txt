355 OPERATIOK OF LITHOTOMY is said to have improved this instrument by making its blade longer and more narrow ; it may be an alteration for the better, for aught I know to the contrary, for I am never so wedded to any thing of my own as not to be fully aware that other people's productions may be far superior. Now, that young people may be readily and successfully cut with a kntfe, I can fully testify ; for, without vanity, I may say that my experience in the operation has been considerable : I have myself cut twenty-four individuals for the stone in the course of one year, partly in private, and partly in hospital practice ; have used both the knife and gorget pretty extensively, and I should hold myself exceedingly culpable if I did not fairly and • candidly communicate to you the unalloyed opinions which I now entertain. Well then, gentlemen, I can tpll you that the knife may be advantageously employed in children—in fact, you may cut a child with any thing, but not so old persons, in whom the prostate and bladder are often diseased, and all the parts extremely rigid : thus, upon such a prostate and bladder the knife makes scarcely any impression, and the opening through the prostate is exceedingly small; while, on the contrary, the ex- ternal wound will be of considerable size, which may be account- ed for from the obvious fact, that the foice is greater near to the hand than at the point of the instrument, which is much farther from the moving power ; you will consequently find, when you are performing the operation of lithotomy with the knife in old persons having diseased prostate and rigid bladder, that you will not be enabled to make an opening sufficient to admit of the cal- culus being extracted with that freedom which every scientific surgeon knows to be prudent. The danger in the operation con- sists in bruising the parts, and not in cutting them. Again, in deep perinei, when operating with the knife, you often think that the instrument has completely entered the bladder, when, proba- bly, its point has scarcely reached the verumontanum ; you are at a It^s—are quite at sea—and cannot tell whether it has entered the bladder or not. Well, gentlemen, the result of my experience has convinced me that, in old persons, the knife is not so good an instrument as either the gorget or the bUtourie cachee ; but in young people it may be used with perfect safety. 1 speak from what I have ob- served, and therefore speak confidently. 1 relinquished the use of the knife in the adult and old persons, because it did not suc- 2a2

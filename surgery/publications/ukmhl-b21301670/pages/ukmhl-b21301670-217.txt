ON THE CURE OF HYDROCELE. 205 fl)t produce adhesion, but a new series of actions was set up, a ufeposit was secreted, and the ends of the arteries were sealed, so that any further secretion was prevented. The process of granulation is set up when an incision is made in the scrotum, and extraneous bodies introduced, but this re- quires considerable caution ; some surgeons use one mode of cure, some another ; various are the operations which have been proposed, but most have now yielded to that of injection. In the operation by incision, you divide the scrotum and tunica vaginalis, on the front part, so as to allow the water to escape ; but it was soon found that this was not sufficient to effect a cure, and it was then recommended, that after the incision had been made, a portion of the tunica vaginalis should be cut out: but this operation is followed by high constitutioqal irritation ; it is true that it sometimes effects a cure by preventing the return of the hydrocele, but it also does it by killing the patient; in fact, the very last time that I saw this operation perforiried, a violent inflammation and sloughing of the scrotum ensued; why, gen- tlemen, any one rather than undergo such an operation, would submit to have a hydrocele all his life; the mode of relief is too cruel for so trifling an inconvenience. The next mode is that of introducing a tent into the tunica vaginalis ; a small incision is made through the tunica vaginalis and scrotum, and a piece of lint or sponge is introduced, so as to prevent the sudden escape of the water ; the water gradually issues out, during which time adhesion and granulation often take place ; but this sometimes faib. Caustic and setons were formerly very much used, two remedies, about which there was as much bandying and quarrel- ling among the members of the profession as if the world were at stake on the issueâ€”two remedies now which are not only generally abandoned, but which I should be ashamed to own ever having used ; such is the folly of quarrelling in our pro- fession ; as for arguments on subjects which are only to be settled by observation, they are of no use; and persons who argue thus a priori, without a knowledge of facts, which alone ought to form the basis of argument in our profession, want that judg- ment which conducts a man best through life ; but many were the advocates of caustic as a cure for hydrocele; and the way it was used was by taking the potassa fusa, and applying it to the fore part of the scrotum, till an eschar of the size of a sixpence, is formed, which produces an irritation to the extent

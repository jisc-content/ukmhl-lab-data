ON HERNIA. 2IG banish it from your minds; the epigastric is the only one in dan- ger, and that only if you cut inwards. After the hernia has protruded through the fascia transversalis, it is situated in the inguinal canal; the next place where it reaches is just under the arch formed by the tendon of the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles ; and here it receives a covering from the cre- master : above the sac then are the internal oblique and transver- salis, and beneath it the fascia transversalis; well, after having passed through the inguinal canal, which may be two inches or from that to two and a half long, it reaches the lower abdominal ring; and at this part the hernial sac will have two coverings, one from the cremaster, and another called the fascia sper- matica ; in this specimen (exhibiting one to the class) you see a hernia with all its coverings ; with respect to the- spermatic cord, it is behind the hernia, and the testicle below it; the in- ternal oblique and transversalis above it, and the fascia transver- salis beneath it. Were you to dissect a hernia below the abdominal ring, you would find the fascia of the cord applied tightly over the hernial sac, which has the appearance of being the sac itself; there is a fibrous covering derived from the cremaster muscle; then cut through these and you see the hernial sac, having the character of peritoneum; you pinch it up with your fingers and divide it, when water immediately escapes. The epigastric artery is si- tuated very close to the hernia, but a little to the pubic side. Well, it is generally thought that the hernial sac is an elonga- tion of the peritoneum; but in the oblique inguinal hernia it is not an elongation, but only a real growth of that part. When you look at the lower part, you will often see a dark-coloured spot, having a blue appearance in the dead body ; and this point is studded with numerous vessels, and in it the ulcerative process has commenced. Some persons say, I mean speculative persons and those who have never observed, â€œ Return the hernial sac into the cavity of the abdomenbut how is it to be returned ? do those persons think it has no attachments 1 It is bound hy firm adhesions, and cannot be returned except in an incipient state, unless by a pain- ful and dangerous process of dissection, which it would not be justifiable to perform. Hernia is subject ta several varieties ; 1st, it is subject to a variety in site; this necessarily happens from the difference of

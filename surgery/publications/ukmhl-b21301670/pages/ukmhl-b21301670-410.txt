398 ON RETENTION OF URINE. nearly as possible, like the natural curve of the urethra. The catheter is not only used for the purpose of drawing off the water, but it is often employed as a btougie; indeed I com- monly use the common catheter, as 1 shall hereafter have oc- casion to state to you, for the purpose of dilating strictures in the urethra, and, consequently, rendering any other operation unnecessary. When you are called upon to introduce a cathe- ter, place yourself upon the right side of the patient, pass it down under the arch of the pubes perpendicularly, until you reach the membranous part of the urethra; and then do not continue to pass the instrument in that direction, for if you do, you will push it towards the rectum instead of entering the bladder; but having reached the membranous part of the urethra, you have only to move your hand thus (showing the motion), and the instrument will immediately enter the bladder. Thus is the whole secret o.‘‘ passing a catheter; you have only to bear in mind the two motions which are neces- sary to effect your purpose, for if you continue to press the catheter onwards, when you have reached the membranous portion of the urethra, you will press the point of the inslju- ment upon the rectum instead of introducing it into the blad- der. In cases of enlargement of the prostate gland, there will be some difference in the mode of passing the catheter; and it is a difference which it is somewhat difficult to explain. When the prostate is enlarged, the urethra is pushed forward so as to be doubled on the point of the instrument. You must, in this case, pass the catheter down to the apex of the prostate gland, then carry the instrument towards the abdo- men, so as to push the urethra as much as you can towards the perinseum, and then having brought the urethra into a straight line again, depress the point of the instrument, and you will be enabled to pass it into the bladder. (The learned professor pro- ceeded to show the method of passing the catheter on the dead subject.) I certainly do hold that it is the fault of the surgeon, if tlie bladder is ever tapped for enlargement of the prostate gland : whenever such an operation is performed for this disease, it arises entirely from the surgeon’s want of knowledge and ad- roitness ; for any man may readily pass an instrument into the bladder in these cases, if he understands the formation of the parts, and has been in the habit of introducing instruments into the bladder, 1 have now for many years been engaged in the

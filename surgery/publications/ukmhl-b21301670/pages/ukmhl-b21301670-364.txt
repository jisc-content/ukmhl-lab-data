OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. 352 learned lecturer touched his forehead)—[a laugh] ; such indi- viduals appear to me, rather to be surgical instrument-makers, thao scientific surgeons ■, and in their ridiculous inventions betray a littleness of mind, which proves them to be totally incapable of achieving any thing that is important—any thing that can add to our store of useful knowledge. The less complicated your in- struments are, and the fewer you employ, so much the better: your operations will be executed with greater ease and expertness, and will prove much more successful in their issue. Sir Casar Hawkins added to the blunt gorget its cutting edge; this was certainly an improvement; but if the instrument be too wide at the part where the prostate and bladder are divided, the Internal pudendal artery will be in great danger of being divided, and this is an accident which you cannot too sedulously avoid.

The gentleman who performed that operation was ever most anxious to discharge his duty with ardour and with zeal; his honourable conduct and gentlemanly deportment, caused him to be sincerely esteemed and respected by his col- leagues, and his resignation, from ill health, to be deeply regretted by his brother surgeons. If I were to be asked how many times I had known the acci- dent of the gorget’s slipping and passing between the bladder and rectum happen, I should say at least a dozen, and ir> each case

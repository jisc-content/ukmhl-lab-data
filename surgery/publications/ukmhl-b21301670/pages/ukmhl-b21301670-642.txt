DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. eso Bge, or the bone will again slip forwards against the coracoid pro- cess. An injury of great violence may occasion the head of the bone to be forced through the integuments in the dislocation forwards. The reduction should be immediately effected, as was before recommended in the dislocation forwards. A suture should be introduced, and lint, dipped in blood, applied to the wound, and adhesive plaster, to retain the apposition of the wound; the limb should be kept close to the side, by a roller including the arm, and thus the least motion prevented. By this treatment, the suppurative inflammation will be prevented, and thepatientâ€™s life not endangered. Accidents about the shoulder joint, with which dislocations ar liable to be confounded, are, first, fracture of the acromion. Here the roundness of the shoulder is, in some measure, lost, and the head of the bone drops towards the axilla. It may be readily distinguished by the shoulder regaining its proper shape on suppotting the arm, and by its again sinking when that support is removed. If you trace the spine of the scapula forwards to the clavicle, on reaching that part the finger sinks into a depres- sion ; then raise the arm, and place one hand firmly on the acromion, and rotate the elbow with the other, and you will dis- tinctly perceive a crepitus. In the treatment of this accident, you are to make the head of the os humeri act as a splint, to support the detached portion of bone: with this view, then, you support the elbow in a short sling, and bend the fore-arm across the chest; put a thick pad between the elbow and the side, so as to separate it widely from it, in order to relax the deltoid. Let the motion of the arm be perfectly prevented, by binding it firmly to the chest by a roller: the elbow should be carried a little backwards. The arm should be kept firmly fixed for three weeks; it will unite by bone, if motion be perfectly prevented; but, as this is very difficult to accomplish, the union is generally ligamentous. The second accident is more likely to be mistaken for dislocation than any other; and this is the fracture through the neck of the scapula. It is impossible, by mere inspection, to distinguish this from dislocation into the axilla. It is to be known by carrying the hand over the shoulder, and resting the finger on the coracoid process ; then, by rotating the arm, a cre- pitus will be felt. Let the surgeon place his arm under the arm of the patient, and, by raising it a little, he restores the natural appearance of the joint; but, by taking away that support, the shoulder again sinks. The treatment of this fracture is, to place

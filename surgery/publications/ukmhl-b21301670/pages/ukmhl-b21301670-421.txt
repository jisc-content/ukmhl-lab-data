ASCITES OH I'EIUTONEAI. DKOl’SY. 409 tions ; the two last mentioned causes are favourable ones, and ascites is frequently cured when occasioned by them. A young man had the operation of paracentesis performed for ascites which had been produced by mercury; three quarts of water were evacuated : this young man recovered. 1 do not mention it as an extraordinary case, either to show that mercury will produce dropsy, or that his recovery from ascites was extra- ordinary; but to point out to you.the impropriety of tapping a person at so early a period of the disease, when the operation is attended with hazard, from the danger you run of wounding the viscera ; 1 do not consider a surgeon justified in performing the operation of paracentesis, when the collection of water is so small, as in this case and more especially as ascites, ^hen caused by debility arising either from fever or mercury, is so generally and readily remediable by medical treatment. Diseases of the heart, lungs, and other organs, will likewise produce ascites, but wlien it results from affections of the two first-mentioned organs, the disease is scarcely ever ascites alone, but is generally combined with hydrothorax ; it is very, very rare to see ascites as the effect of disease of the heart or lungs, without its being at the same time accompanied by hydro- thorax. Treatmint.—Now gentlemen, medical treatment, when judi- ciously pursued, is very often successful in the cure of ascites : in the use of medicines, however, you must take care to direct their influence against the cause of ascites; therefore, if the liver is the defective organ, you should endeavour to restore its healthy functions, and in this attempt your efforts will be frequently crowned with success, unless the disease has existed so long a time as completely to have broken up the constitution. When the disease is occasioned by local irritation, arising, fijr example, from enlargement of the spleen, you will then find great difficulty in performing a cure ; but, gentlemen, it is not so in dropsy, arising from debility, independent of disorganization. I again repeat to you, that ascites thus occasioned can be easily cured by medical means. Those who indulge in the use of ardent spirits are likewise often affected with dropsy of the abdomen; the spirits heat and stimulate the stomach, liver, duodenum, and neighbouring parts, and act upon the same principle, and produce the same result, as the irritation arising from an enlarged spleen ; they occasion

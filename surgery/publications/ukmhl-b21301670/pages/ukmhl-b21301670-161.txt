ON WOUNDS OF THE BRAIN, 14.9 Inflammation following Wounds op the Brain. I shall now speak more particularly of the inflammation which follows wounds of the brain, wherein their chief danger consists j which danger is much increased, if the dura mater be the part attacked. Upon the first approach of inflammation, the person complains of a great pain in the head; very quickly falLs into a comatose state; and when roused from this condition, the pain is excessive ; the scalp round the external wound, becomes oede- matous, for, if you press upon it, the impression of the finger is retained; the edges of the wound have a shining glossy appearance, and from the wound itself therfe is discharged a fluid, composed of blood and serum; sometimes the parts about the wound have a sloughy appearance ; the countenance is very much flushed, and the carotid arteries beat with very great force ; so much so, that if his shirt-collar be open, you can see the pulsation of the carotids, at some distance from the bed ; this circumstance, of itself, would be quite sufficient to convince you that there was a great determination of blood to the brain. The next thing which you observe is, that the patient is seized with rigors, and these follow in very quick succession ; hemi- plegia likewise often attends, and is generally situated on that side of the body opposite to the wound; the patient remains in a comatose state, but, when roused, will give you (until towards the very last) rational answers to such questions as may be put to him. These, tlien, are the ordinary symptoms of inflamma- tion of the brain, arising from wounds of that organ. If the inflammation should terminate in suppuration, I have already shown you in a fonner lecture where the matter would be situated, viz., between tlie dura mater and skull (this rarely happens), pia mater and tunica arachnoides, pia mater and surface of the brain, and lastly in the substance of the brain itself. When pus is situated between the dura mater and skull, trephining for its removal would be attended with complete success; but the chances of finding it there are against you, as it is generally situated be- tween the pia mater and surface of the brain, for which an operation would prove worse than u.seless. Another situation in the head where matter has been found, is in the longitudinal smus of the dura mater. This woman (holding up a preparation) seventeen months before she died, fell down stairs, and her head went in violent contact against a chest, by which she became stunned ; for sometime after the fall, matter was discharged from one of her ears; this at length ceased, and to all appear-

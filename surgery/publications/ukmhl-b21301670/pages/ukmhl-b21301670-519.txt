ON VIRULENT GONORRHCEA. 507 hesive matter between the corpus spongiosum and surface of the urethra. At the commencement of the formation of every permanei» stricture, you are made acquainted with the real nature of the complaint by the following symptoms :—The first is, the reten- tion of a few drops of nrine in the urethra, after the whole ap- pears to have been discharged ; so that when the penis has been returned into the small clothes, the linen becomes slightly wetted, and if you press on the under side of the urethra, a few drops more will be voided, which had collected between the neck of the bladder and that part of the urethra where the stricture is situated. The next circumstance you notice is an irritable state of the bladder; this is evinced by the person not being enabled to sleep so long as usual without discharging his urine. A man in health, will sleep for seven, eight, or nine hours, without being obliged to empty his bladder; but when he has stricture, he cannot continue for a longer period than four or five hours, and frequently much less even than this. The next circumstance observable is the division of the stream ; the reason of which is that the urethra is in an uneven state from the irregular swelling wh'ch surrounds it, and consequently the urine is thrown with an inerjuality of force against its different sides ; sometimes the stream splits into two, becoming forked; sometimes it is spiral ; at other times it forms, as it were, a thin sheath. Occasionally the stream rises perpendicularly, its long axis being at right angles to the long axis of the penis; thus, then, the retention of a few drops of urine after the whole appears to have been dis- charged, a more frequent propensity to make water than when in health, and the peculiar characters of the stream, as just de- scritied to you, will be conclusive evidence of the existence of stricture. In addition, there will sometimes be a discharge from the urethra, which renders the linen of a bluish-white, similar to the appearances produced by nocturnal emissions: if the in- dividual rides much on horseback the urine will be high-coloured, depending upon the degree of excitement existing in the urethra. The next thing which the patient notices is, that he discharges his urine by drops; and, from the irritable state of the bladder, the water is constantly dropping or distilling away from the ori- fice of the urethra. An individual, then, having permanent stricture, first observes a few drops of the water remain after the whole seems to have been discharged, then notices a fine spiral

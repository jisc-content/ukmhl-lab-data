407 ASCITES OR EERITOXEAL DROPSY. Ascites, on Pehitonf.al Dhopby. The 6rst symptom wliich a person feels who is affected with ascites, is pain on the abdomen being pressed ; every day this symptom becomes more and more severe, until even the clothes, ever so loosely worn, will feel too tight on the body, and the person will feel desirous of having them removed. Well, the body goes on gradually enlarging, until, at length, the person applies for medical advice. Upon examination, it will be found that the intestines are floating in a fluid, the abdomen enlarged, (in proportion, of course, to the quantity of fluid within) and upon loosening the clothes, applying a hand to each side of the body, and gently using pressure with one hand, and slightly tapping the abdomen with the other, or giving the bpdy a gentle jerk from side to side, fluctuation will be readily perceived. As the secretion of water increases, the abdomen becomes more tense, pressure is produced on the diaphragm, which occasions a diffi- culty of breathing, wliich is more especially felt in the hurry of exercise, so that dyspnoea at length becomes a very distressing symptom, arising from the accumulation of water in the abdo- men, until it reaches the lower port of the diaphragm, in conse- quence of w hich the contraction of that muscle becomes neces- sarily impeded, and the difficulty of breathing thereby produced. As the abdomen increases, fluctuation may, as I before stated â€¢o you, be easily distinguished by applying your hand to one side of the body, and by gently tapping the opposite side with the other, the undulations of the water will be readily felt by the fingers which are pressing on the abdomen ; thus, then, the fluid being so readily felt, and the symptoms so mani- fest, viz.: The difficulty of breathing, the great increase of that quick- ness, on taking exercise, the inconvenience arising from the slightest pressure by the clothes, and the gradual enlargement of the abdomen, so strongly pointing out the true character of the disease, it is hardly possible you can form an incorrect opinion respecting it. The quantity of water usually drawn from individuals affected with ascites, is from twenty-five to thirty pints ; in this respect, liowever, as you may suppose, there is considerable variation, but the quantity a surgeon expects who has performed the opera- tion of tapping on many persons, is what 1 have just stated to you ; and from twenty-five to thirty pints, the first time the ope-

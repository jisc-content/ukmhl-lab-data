These are the three situations in which extravasated blood is principally found. 1 do not find any difference of symptoms produced by the diflcrent situations of the blood ; the compression is produced by the pressure of the blood, and the quantity of blood effused will depend on the size of the vessel of the dura mater that is divided ; whatever is the situation then of the blood, the symptoms of compression are the same : if there should be any blood resting on the origin of a nerve, their will be partial paralysis of the part which that nerve supplies. In the treatment of these cases there is little to be done* If extravasation of blood occurs with fracture trephining may be of use. You should deplete freely, for the purpose of preventing mflammation : irritation is to be lessened, the bowels are to be opened, and the patient kept very quiet. If there is a bruise near the fracture, indicating the spot where the effused blood is, you may trephine, that is, before symptoms of excitement come on: when they take place, you must deplete only, and not dream of performing the operation ; to do it under such circumstances would be highly absurd, and the height of madness.

Fractures of the skull are not of themselves dangerous, nor are they injurious to the brain ; therefore these fractures do not call for any alarm, if care be taken to prevent the inflammation ; the danger in these cases is to be apprehended from disturbance in some distant part, irritation of the system, or extravasation; it is not then, I repeat, from the fracture itself that the danger is to be apprehended, but from compression of the brain, extravasation of blood, or irritation in some distant part; therefore, when called to a case of fracture of the skull, do not operate, but consider the symptoms that are present, endeavour to ascertain from what they arise, and then regulate your treatment accordingly; if the symptoms are those of concussion, the treatment must be di- rected to it; if those of extravasation of blood, and there is not much excitement, it will be necessary to remove a portion of bone ; but if there be fracture only, without any of the symptoms above mentioned, there will be no occasion to operate. When a fracture occurs at the base of the skull, it is much more dangerous than at any other part, because extravasation is much more likely to take place, or if not, inflammation of the brain, from the violence of the injury received, very often super-

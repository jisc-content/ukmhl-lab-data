ON POISONS, 4-86 times injected without any bad consequences, but this is in cases where the patient has considerable strength of constitu* tion. When the constitution is delicate and weakly, even a drachm of tobacco used in an injection will sometimes prove destructive to life. I shall now mention to you another circumstance respecting the external application of tobacco. The mother of a boy, who was the subject of tinea capitis, having heard that tobacco was the best remedy for this complaint, went to a tobacco dealer, and bought some tobacco juice, which, as I afterwards learnt, is pre- pared in the following way : A quantity of moist tobacco is placed between two rollers, and very strongly pressed, so that the juice exudes ; and, in thus way, an extract of tobacco is produce 1 of the very strongest kind. It is used for the purpose of destroying insects, and it is also em- ployed in eruptive complaints of sheep and other animals.

He had had a copious evacuation into his clothes ; he was carried up stairs, put to bed, and, at four in the afternoon he died. A surgeon in the neighbourhood hearing of these circumstances, communicated them to me. I attended for the purpose of examining the body, and did not find any appearance of disease. There was a little effusion of fluid between the scalp and the bone, but none in the membranes or ventricles of the brain. If tobacco be introduced in any quan- tity into the stomach of animals, it kills them very quickly, by putting a stop to the action of the heart. 'J'he oil produced from tobacco, by burning it, is highly poisonous; it destroys if admi- nistered in very small quantities. With respect to its introduction by smoking, f have never known ah instance of death being pro- duced by it in this way. Opium, administered in considerable quantities, destroys life by producing apoplectic symptoms. I'he first case of the destruc- tion of human life by opium, which I had an opportunity of witnessing, was one in which the person was suspected of having committed a murder. He was seen at a great distance from the

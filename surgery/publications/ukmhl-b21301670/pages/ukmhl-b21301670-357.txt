OPERATION OT LITHOTOMY. 345 the lateral operation, together with the high operation, and shall also show j’ou a forceps for removing calculi from the bladder, when they are small, without having recourse to any cutting oper- ation. And first I shall describe the lateral operation; I shall not perform it this evening, for I don’t know whether there is a subject or not, but I shall state to you the circumstances to be attended to before the operation, give you a description of the in- struments required, and perform the operation on the next even- ing- 'I'he first circumstance to consider before you operate for litho- tomy, is whether the constitution of the patient is in a sound state or his general health good. He who practises surgery must know that if an operation were performed as soon as the symp- toms of stone arise, without first enquiring into the state of the patient’s constitution, the surgeon would lose a great number of his patients, and soon injure his character ; there is no operation in which an attention to the constitution is more necessary before it is performed than that for the stone. The person should be in good general health at the time, for unless he is, there will be bttle chance of success. Those who have been exposed to the vicissitudes of life and to poverty, and have been obliged to labour for their bread, generally bear the operation for stone well, and in those persons the chance of success is considerably greater than in the higher ranks of society, and those you generally meet with in private practice. Let any man be honest, and he must acknowledge that in hospital practice there is infinitely more success than in private practice ; for those who have been rear- ed in the lap of luxury, and have drunk freely, if submitted to an operation for stone frequently die from it. Therefore with respect to the higher orders of society, unless a surgeon previous- ly study the constitution, and require his patients to live differently from what they have been accustomed, he will injure his reputa- tion, and lose his patients. Great advantage will be derived from putting a patient, who is to be operated on for stone, on vegeta- ble food, a short time beforehand ; it is not right that he should be on full, or animal diet. It is also improper to operate on a patient as soon as he is admitted into the hospital; the surgeon should wait, and have the patient prepared by giving him vege- table food, and also sounding him frequently, the introduction of the sound accustoms the bladder to irritation, and when it has been done pretty often before the operation is performed, the pa-

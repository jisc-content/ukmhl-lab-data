ox VIRULENT GONORRIICEA. 511 the purpose of rendering them soft, when, if they are introduced into the urethra, and pass througli the stricture, you will ascer- tain the distance at which it is situated from the orifice, and the form and size of the stricture will be modelled on the bougie. You then pass another bougie, a little larger than the first; and, directly that is withdrawn, another size, still larger. On the fol- lowing day you again introduce two bougies, that is, if there be no existing inflammation to prevent it; the first bougie you then use, is to be of the same size as the one with which you con- cluded on the previous day ; after this has been withdrawn, you again pass another, a size larger than the first; thus using on every occasion two bougies, always beginning with one of the same size as that with which you had concluded on each preceding occa- sion. By adopting this plan, strictures may be cured in a quar- ter of the time that they usually are, and the strictured part of the urethra speedily made to regain its natural size. Bougies have been numbered from one to sixteen, so that surgeons may on each occasion know the size they are using, and the size they last used : number sixteen is large enough for a walking stick, and evidently too big to be safely passed into any urethra ; and number fourteen is of quite sufficient magnitude to establish the natural passage of any urethra. It is not necessary to leave in the bougie any length of time ; for, when the bougie has passed the stricture, the effect of dilatation has been produced. Mever attempt to pass a bougie in its straight state ; for, if you do, it will be obstructed in its passage, whether, there be stricture or not; you should invariably give it, before its introduction, the curve of the catheter; with regard to elastic gum bougies, they are not employed. Every surgeon, I believe, has a mode of practice peculiar to himself; the bougie I use is made of silver; it is of tlie form of the catheter, but at the point, and running back for some distance towards the handle, it is conical ; and the way I use it is this ; I first pass down, in the manner described to you, a wax bougie, for the purpose of ascertaining the form, size, and distance of the stricture. Having obtained a knowledge of these, I then in- troduce my conical silver bougie, the point of which having eiitered the stricture the further it passes the greater is the dila- tation produced, in consequence of the form of the instrument This bougie I have found extremely serviceable, and is the best

408 ASCITES OR PERITONEAL DROPST. ration 13 performed, will be the quantity generally drawn off. The fluid secreted in ascites is serous, but does not contain so much albumen as serum in general: when ascites is present, and inflammation of the abdomen follows, it will occasionally hap- pen that so large a quantity of adhesive matter will escape from the vessels as W mix with the serum, and cause it readily to coa- gulate, by the addition of the mineral acids or alcohol ; but such a quantity of adhesive matter as produces this effect is not often met with. The fluid, therefore, found in ascites, is more of a watery nature, having in its composition less albumen than serum in general. The Causes of Ascites. The most common cause of ascites is disease of the liver; at this period of our session it would be impertinent in me to de- scribe to you the anatomy of this part; you will, therefore, readily understand me when I say, that diseases of the liver, by impeding the circulation of the blood through that organ, by obstructing Its free passage, must, of necessity occasion a congestion of blood in the vessels of the mententery, stomach, spleen, pancreas, and neighbouring parts; and for the relief of this congestion, na- ture is under the necessity of effusing, from the filled vessels, the serum which we subsequently find, in the bag of the perito- neum. But besides this common cause of ascites, arising from the mechanical obstruction of return of the blood, there is another cause which very frequently produces the disease, viz., enlarge- ment of the abdominal viscera; say the spleen, for example ; from its enlargement, it presses upon and irritates the peritoneum ; a greater quantity of blood than usual is then determined to the part with a view of getting rid of the irritation, which, however, still continuing, the serum becomes secreted so profusely as to produce the disease of which I am now speaking ; so that although the two causes T have mentioned are widely different in princi- ple, yet in effect they are precisely similar. In the first it is produced through mechanical obstruction ; whereas in the last it is the result of local irritation ; besides the causes just named, there are others which produce it; the most common is the debility arising from fever. Mercury likewise will give rise to it, if administered in such quantities ns to ex- ceed or overcome the powers of the body in debilitated constitu-

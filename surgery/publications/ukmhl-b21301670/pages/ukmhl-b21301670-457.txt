ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS, 445 of ilie stump ; straps of adhesive plaister are then to be applied over tlie integuments, some longitudinally, and others perpen- dicularly, for the purpose of making it circular. These longitu- dinal and perpendicular straps should be secured in their situa- tion by a strap applied over them, and around the limb, so as to retain the first straps that were applied in their proper situa- tion. 'J'he cooler the stump is kept after the operation the better j there will be less danger from hemorrhage, and less chance of the suppurative inflammation taking place; the adhesive is what we want, and this you will be most likely to obtain by keeping the stump in as cool a state as possible. No rollers are applied to stumps by surgeons of the present day—no tow, no flannel caps, as there were formerly. ' Now, as to the time for removing the dressings: On the sixth day you may take away one strap, for the purpose of permitting any pus that may have collected to escape; and on the eighth day you may remove the whole of the straps, substituting for each, as soon as taken off, a fresh strap of the same kind of plaister: it would be the height of impropriety to take oft’ at the same time the whole of the plaister at so early a period, as it would probably destroy the whole of the adhesions which had formed ; therefore, on the eighth day, when you remove each strap of plaister, put another in its place before you Like oft’ a second. Op Amputation of the Thigh. To amputate above the knee requires but little art or anatomi- cal knowledge ; some degree of skill, however, must be practised in the operation, if the surgeon wishes to have a good stump after it; the whole art of the operation consists in making the incisions through the muscles in such a manner as to prevent the stump from becoming of a conical shape at a subsequent period. It is not always desirable to perform this operation very near the knee-joint; in fact, in many instances it is a great fault to do so, but more especially when the knee is affected with fungoid or scrofulous disease ; and I will tell you why. Under the tendon of the rectus muscle, for an inch and a half at least above the pa- tella, are situated a quantity of burs® mucos®, and if these be cut into under any circumstances, when amputating, it is bad enough, because generally, most extensive suppuration will fol- Inw, which will protract most materially the healing of the Rump, and if you operate in consequence of a fungoid or scrofu- .ous disease of the knee, and then should cut into burs®, tl)e

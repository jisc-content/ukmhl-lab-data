520 INFLAMMATION OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. InniTAiii.E State op the Urethra. If attended with inflammation, it, is of the chronic kind. Per- sons having this complaint have a frequent desire to make water. This disorder may be cured by giving, three times a day, an eighth part of a grain of the oxymuriate of mercury, and a drachm of the nitrous spirit of sether ; these may be taken in any convenient vehicle, should be continued for a little time, and the complaint will disappear.

200 ON THE CURE OF HYDRO of half an inch, or three quarters of an inch around, and then the eschar so produced destroys the skin and tunica vaginalis; as soon as the inflammation arises, the water escapes, then the parts sometimes become glued together, and granulations arise. Well, gentlemen, this remedy soon fell into disrepute ; 1st, on account of its uncertainty : 2dly, because it was dangerous to life; here is a specimen (pointing to one on the table), taken from a person who died from the application of caustic, and this gives me an opportunity of showing you the state of the parts after the use of this application. The operation with caustic is dangerous to life, and ought not to be performed. Operations at present used for the cure of Hydrocele. There are but three operations I know of, which are occa- sionally had recourse to in the cure of hydrocele : 1st, setons ; 2dly, incision : 3dly, injection, Setons are very rarely used, but I tell you, that they may now and then be, advantageously. The seton should be made in the following way : you should take a curved needle, and carry it into the tunica vaginalis and scrotum, just at the point where the trocar had been previously introduced, and include two inches above the point where the needle enters, and bring it out sufficiently long; the result is, inflammation generally ensues, water gradually escapes, and as this takes place, adhesion of the tunica vaginalis comes on; this operation for adults has been generally abandoned, because better means have been employed; it is in those young persons whose hy- droceles do not give way to the absorbent plan before-mentioned; then, if children about two or three years old have hydroceles, rather than inject, use the needle and thread; the thread should be allowed to remain for ten or fburteen days, till inflammation and the adhesive process be set up; this plan is much better for children than that of injection, because there is no diffi- culty in doing the former, and there is considerable in the ratter: for the operation of putting a ligature through the scrotum and tunica vaginalis is effected before the child knows any thing about it; in fact, after it is done, the child may run about, the knot being allowed to remain ; the water escapes by the side of the seton : for children, then, I believe this to be the best mode. The second plan is by Incision. There is a difference in per- forming this operation now to what was done by Mr. flunter, who had recourse to it in preference to that of caustic or seton;

350 OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. gative, your reputation may receive unmerited injury, Tlie rea- son why you sliould be thus cautious, after what I stated to you in my last must be sufficiently obvious, viz., from the well-known fact, that a calculus may be detected by the sound at one time and not at another; so that if, after an examination, you were posi- tively to tell a person that he had not a stone in his bladder, and upon being sounded the following day by another surgeon he was as positively assured to the contrary, if it should prove in the sequel that you were wrong, the patient would lose all confidence in you, entertain opinions unfavourable to your professional talents, and report you to his friends accordingly. Be therefore on your guard. In the lateral operation of lithotomy, you are to begin your in- cision a little on the left side of the raphe, immediat.ly below the symphysis pubis, and carry it obliquely downwards and outwards to midway between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium, and the termination of the incision should be opposite the centre of the anus. Before you commence the incision, you should draw aside the raphe towards the ramus of the ischium on the right side. Never begin an operation without having first reflected well on what you are going to do; and in making incisions through the skin, you should, before you apply the knife, mark out with your eye the course which such incisions should take, and the precise point where they should terminate. Well then, the first cut through the skin, made in the direction just men- tioned, penetrates the skin and cellular substance, and lays bare the accelerator urinae ; you then, with the fingers of your left hand, push or draw the bulb of the penis under the ramus of the ischium on the right side, so that the next incision will pass be- between the bulb and crus penis of the left side ; there is no ne- cessity in reality for cutting the bulb, and it should therefore be avoided ; well, carrying your knife forward between the bulb and crus, you divide the accelerator urinae, and this you should do completely, for if you permit any portion of its fibres to remain undivided, particularly at the upper part, if the stone should be at all large, you would find that their contractions would very much increase the difficulty of withdrawing the stone ; as soon as the accelerator urinÂ® has been cut through, you expose the traasverse perinei; you are then to feel for the groove of the staff with the nail of the index finger of the left hand, and having fully satisfied yourself of its situation, you are to cut into it through

Chap. IX. Of Aneurifms. 2q6 From what has been fald, therefore, it mufl: appear, that when an anenrifm is fo fituated, natomy in Glafgow. And what rendered this cafe more remarkable, was, that after the trunk of the large artery was fecured with ligatures, it was neceffary to perform the operation again upon a fmall branch of an artery which had been wounded, even farther up than the prin- cipal trunk. For fome time after the operation, the limb remained colder than the other, and it was upwards of a week be- fore any pulfation could be felt in the artery at the ankle. In two months from the operation, the wound was com- pletely [healed, and the circulation and heat returned; and in a fhort time thereafter, the patient had fo far re- covered the ufe of his limb, as to be able to take very violent exercife. Thefe particulars I thought it right to communicate, as the cafe of this patient is one of a few well authenticated inftances, of this operation having been attempted on the femoral artery fo near to its origin â€¢, and the fuccefs at- tending it furely points out the propriety of the meafure, in every aneurifm, even of thefe parts, not evidently arifing from general debility of the coats of the artery. In Vol. HI, Article XII. of the London Medical Ob- fervations, another inftance is related of the operation for the aneurifm having been performed on the trunk of the femoral artery, by Mr Burchal, furgeon in Manchefter ^ the patient recovered, and the limb became nearly as flrong and as ferviceable as the other.

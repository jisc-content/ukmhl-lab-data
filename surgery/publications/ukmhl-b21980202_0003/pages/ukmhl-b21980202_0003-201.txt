203 Of Aneurifms. Sed. I, When aji aneurifm is fo fituated, that no ligature or" efFedual compreffion can be applied for putting a flop to ,^the circu- lation, if the artery is large, there would be the utmoft hazard in opening it; as the as related in the 3d Volume of the London Medical Ob- fervations, remains nearly in the fame ftate as at the time that account of it was made out, which was at leaft twen- ty years ago; only that the veins are rather more enlar- ged, The patient recovered, and the limb became nearly as flrong and ferviceable as the other. The man has all along continued his bufinefs as flioemaker, and has lately recovered from a fprain in the affefted arm, which he re- ceived in lifting a heavy burden. In a letter from Mr Pott, whofe opportunities for ob- fervation were great, he fays, â€œ That he has met with three different inftahces of this fpecies of aneurifm, and that^the operation never became necelfary in any of them. Among other inftances of varicofe aneurifm which have appeared here, a young man from Paifley, who had the misfortune to meet with it feveral years ago, was examined by different furgeons of this place. The dif- eafe was clearly marked, and no operation was advifed. In a letter from Mr Hamilton, Profeffor of Anatomy in Glafgow, I am informed, that this man was lately ferving in the Navy, where he undergoes great fatigue without any inconvenience from the aneurifm, although it was fhen of thirteen years continuance.

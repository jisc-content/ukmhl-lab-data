Of Blood-letting. 11 Sea. I. but every praditioner of charader will acknowledge, that, in order to perform it properly, the great^ft nicety, fteadinefs, and exadnefs, are required. Every o~ ther operation in furgery I have frequent- ly feen well performed i, but I have fel- dom feen blood-letting with the lancet corredly done. When properly perform- ed, it is a neat operation 3 but when not dpne with exadnefs, it is the very re- verfe. I do not here mean to confider the vari- ous caufes which in different circumftan- ces point out the propriety of abftrading blood from the fyftem ^ nor do I intend to enter upon a particular difcufGon of the different effeds of general and topi- cal blood-letting: Thefe confiderations, as being highly important, would of them- felves extend to a great length, fo that they will not be looked for in a fyftem of furgery. All that is here intended, is to defcribe as clearly as poflible the various modes of performing the operation of blood-letting. la

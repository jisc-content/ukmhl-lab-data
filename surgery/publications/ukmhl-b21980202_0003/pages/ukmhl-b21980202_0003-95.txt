97 Sea. L Of Blood-letting. The fize of the orifice in bloodletting fhould at all times be determined by the nature of the difeafe for which the eva- cuation is preforibed. When it is meant to difcharge a large quantity of blood fuddenly, either with a view to excite fainting, or for any other reafon, the ori- fice muft neceflarily be large 5 but in ordinary praaice, no neceflity occurs for this. In ufing a fpear-pointed lancet, an ori- fice of an eighth part of an inch in length will in general anfwer every purpofe; but when a broad-fhouldered lancet is ufed, an opening of twice that fize becomes ne- celTary, for with this inltrument the ori- fice in the vein will feldom be more than half the extent of that in the fkin. After withdrawing the lancet, I have defired that the thumb of the left-hand fliould be removed from the fpot on which it was placed : It may perhaps appear that fome circumftances are here pointed out, with unneceflary minuteiiefs, and this a- mong others may poJflibly be confidered VoL.

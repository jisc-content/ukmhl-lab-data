VI. can no necellity for carrying the liga- tures three inches from the edges of the fore y and again, in very fuperficial cuts, it fometimes happens that the ligatures ought to be pafled out at a diftance from the edges of the wound greater than its breadth. It ought not, in almoft any cafe, to be lefs than half an inch from the edge of the fore; and it will feldom happen, even in the largeft wounds, that the di- ftance of an inch is not found to be fuf- ficient. It will be readily underftood, that the flrength of the ligatures and fize of the iieedles ought always to be proportioned to the depth of the fores and retradion of parts. The feyeral fizes of needles reprefented in Plate III. are fuch as are found to anfwer bell; and the ligatures to be ufed along with them ought to be fuch as nearly, though not entirely, fill the-eyes of the needles.

SecS, II. from external Violence. . 253 although the upper part of the fkull is commonly fmooth^, almoft the vfhole un- der part of it is rugged and unequal. This inequality on the outfide feems to be calculated for the better attachment of the different mufcles which move the head y and an the iiifide it ferves the pur- pofe of fupporting the different parts of the brain and cerebellum. Almofl the whole of the occipital bone is very unequal both in its external and internal fiirfaces ; this is likewife the cafe with all the inferior part of the temporal bones, and with the under part of the os frontis 3 and therefore it is obvious^ that none of thefe fituations are fo proper for the application of the trepan, as the more fmooth and,equal parts of the fl^ull. The fkull is externally covered with the common teguments of the body, the Ikin^, and cellular fubflance ; with the frontal,, occipital, and temporal mufcles:, and an aponeurotic expanfion formed by a com- bination of the tendinous fibres of all thefe ; and more immediately by the pe- ricanium.

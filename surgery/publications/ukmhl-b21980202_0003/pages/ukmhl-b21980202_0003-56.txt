58 Of the Ligature Chap. VII. riik of this is avoided, as the ligatures generally drop of their own accord, in the courfe of the third or fourth drelGng of the fore. I fliall, therefore, confider it as a prac- tice that fliould be eftablilhed, that inform- ing the ligature of arteries, the nerves and other contiguous parts ought to be a- voided. For the purpofe of performing this with eafe and fafety, various kinds of Forceps have been invented, with which the di- vided arteries are laid hold of and pulled out, fo as to admit of the application of ligatures.

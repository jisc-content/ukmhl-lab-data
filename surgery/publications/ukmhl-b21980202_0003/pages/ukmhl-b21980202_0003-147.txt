Se6t. VI. Of Blood-letting, 149 K3 SEC- fhould make an orifice fufEcIently large for the Intended evacuation. It may be proper to obferve, that a larger opening is neceflary in the neck than In the* arm, otherwife the quantity of blood Is procu- red with difficulty : And befides, there is not here the fame neceffity for caution on this point that there is, in the arm: for in the neck, we meet with no diffi- culty in putting a flop to the blood ; after removing the ligature, all that is com- monly. neceflary, even when the orifice is extenfive, is to clofe it with a flip of adhelive plafter. In order to bring the vein more clear- ly into view, fo as afterwards to be able to open it with more exadnefs, foine have direded, that the fkin, cellular fub- ftance, and mufcular fibres, covering the vein, fhould be prevloufly divided with a fcalpel. This, however, is uniieceflary ^ and it renders the operation both more painful and more tedious than when done wdth the lancet at once.

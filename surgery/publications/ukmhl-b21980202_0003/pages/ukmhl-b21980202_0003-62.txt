Thofe in common ufe are made with three edges, one on each fide, atid a third ori the concave part of the needle. There is no neceffity, however, for more than two : Indeed the needle enters more eafi- ly with two than with three edges; and as the third edge on the concave fide, renders them liable to injure arteries and other parts in the courfe of their intro- duction, it ought to be omitted. A needle of this fliape, armed with a ligature of a fize proportioned to itfelf and to the velTel to be taken up, is to be introduced at the diftance of a fixth or eighth part of an inch from the artery ; and being carried at lead: one half round the artery, at a depth fufficient for re- taining it, it miift now be drawn out; and being again pufiied forward, till it has completely encircled the artery, it is a- gain to be pulled out, atid a knot tied of

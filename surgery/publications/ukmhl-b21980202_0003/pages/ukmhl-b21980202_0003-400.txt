402 Affections of the Brain Chap^. X. view from this operation, is to remove prefliire from the brain: But in an infla- med flate of this organ, as no prefTure is fuppofed to exift, the remedy is of courfe unneceflary. If pradlitioners would allow themfelves to be directed by the effedls of thofe re- medies that prove ufeful in fimilar affec- tions of other parts of the body, inflam- mation of the brain would never be treat- fed in this manner: We would not furely exped: to derive advantage from perfora- ting the chefl in the firfl: flage of an in- flammatory alfedion of the pleura; nor would any furgeon advife it till the for- mation of matter was fully indicated. Befides this, however, I am decidedly of opinion, that the, trepan cannot be ap- plied in Inflammation of the brain, but with manifefl: hazard : It tends always to increafe the fymptoms of inflammation; and in almoft every inftance in which I have known it eniployed during this ftate of the difeafe, the dura mater has been foupd, after death, either in a flate of mortification.

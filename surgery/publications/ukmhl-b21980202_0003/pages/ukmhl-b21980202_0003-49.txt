Chap. VII. of Arteries, &c. D 2 Thus, ced, by the nerves and cohtlguous parts being at the fame time compreiTed with the arteries; and, in fome inftances, vio- lent convulfive aflecSions have arifen from this, not only of the part chiefly affedied, but of the whole fyftem. Spafmodic twitches frequently take place after the amputation of limbs, and are often the fource of much diftrefs. In fome inftances., this fymptom is no doubt the efFeÂ£l of other caufes; but in various ca- fes it has happened, that the cleareft proof has been obtained of its arifing from the ligatures of arteries applied in an Impro- per manner. When convulfive affedlons occur after amputations, and the ufual means of preventing them are found to fail, effedual relief may be frequently obtained by undoing the ligatures, fo as to remove the compreflion upon the nerves i care being taken at the fame time to re- new the ligatures upon the arteries alone, without comprehending any of the con- tiguous parts.

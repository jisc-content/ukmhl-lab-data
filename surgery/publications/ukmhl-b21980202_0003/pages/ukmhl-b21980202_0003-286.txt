X, ment of this inftrument: They have ra- ther Indeed hurt it materially by form- ing it fo as to render the operation of perforating the fkull with it both more difficult and more tedious than is necef- fary. The inftrument delineated in Plate VIII, cuts the bone not only more quickly, but with equal fafety. The timi- dity of fome operators however has made them imagine, that this inftrument cannot be ufed but with the hazard of pafling too fuddenly through the bone at the end of the operation, by which the brain would be unavoidably injured : They have ac- cordingly invented another, which di- vides the bone very flowly, and which they therefore fuppofe will perform the operation with more fafety. This Inftru- ment is termed a Trephine, and is deli- neated in Plate IX. fig. i. It is not however, pqfiefied of any advantage over the other, not even that of being more fafe for perforating the bone : For the fame degree of force muft be applied by the operator with each of them; and it has this very material defeft, that it re- quires

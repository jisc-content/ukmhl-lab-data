A needle being put upon each end of the fame thread, and each needle being inferred at the bottom of the fore, and pulhed outwardly, fo as to pafs out at a proper diftance from the edge of the wound, the needles are then to be taken off, and the threads allowed to re- tnain till all the ligatures are palled which the extent of the fore feems to require. The number of ligatures necellary for any wound, muft in a great meafure de- pend upon the extent of the divided parts.

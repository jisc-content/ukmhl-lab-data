104 Of Blood-letting. Chap. VIII SECTION II. Of a "thrombus, or Ecchymojis^ IHave already delired, that in blood- letting, the member fhouid be retain- ed in the fame pofture, till the whole quan- tity of blood intended to be taken is dif- charged. When this is negleded, a fmall tumor is apt to form immediately above the orifice in the vein, by the blood infi- nuating into the cellular fubftance' of the neighbouring parts.. This kind of tunior^ when round and fmall, is termed a Throm- bus y that every time a lancet is ufed, it mult be more or lefs injured; and as the prevention of pain is with moft pa- tients a point of no fmall importance, I think it ought to be laid down as a rule not to be departed from, never to ufe the fame lancet twice, without putting it into the hands of a cutler. This I have long been in the pradice of doing, not only with, lancets, but with every cutting inftrument; and the trouble and expence attending it is inconliderable, when compared with the advantage de- rived from it.

78 Of Blood-letting, Chap. VIII. In all inflammatory alFedions produ- cing difeafe of the fyftem, the method of taking away blood as eftablilhed by immemorial pradlige, is, by fuch means as difcharge the quantity to be taken, at an opening made with a lancet, either in an artery or a vein. Whether there is any real difference in the effeds produ- ced by thefe two modes of difcharging blood, it may be difficult, with precifion, to determine ^ but there is reafon to think, that, independent of the quantity taken, the difference is of lefs importance than is commonly imagined. The latter of thefe termed Phlebotomy, and the for- mer Arteriotomy, are the means employed for what we term general blood-letting ; the particular confideration of which we fhall prefently enter upon. . . But it often happens, in local inflam- mation, that general blood-letting has n6 great influence, while confiderable advan- tage is obtained from what we term Topi- cal or Local blood-letting, in which blood isdifcharged from the part immediately af- feded.

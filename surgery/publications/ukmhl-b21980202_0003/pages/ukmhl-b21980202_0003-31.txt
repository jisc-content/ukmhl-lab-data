SeA. V. 33 Of Sutures* from the edge of the fore that it Was made to enter at on the other. The diftance at which the needle ought to enter from the edge of the fore^ muft' be determined by the depth of the wound, and by the degree of retraction produced in the divided parts; but whatever the deepnefs of the wound may be, the pins ought to pafs within a very little of its bottom; otherwife the parts which lie deep will run a riik of not being uni- ted; a circumftance which will frequent- ly give rife to fores or colledions of mat- ter. In pafiing the pins through the fides of the wound, if the ikin and other tegu- ments are not more firm than ordinary, it may commonly be done with the fin- gers alone, and particularly if the pins are made with fmall heads or knobs for the fingers to prefs upon ; but when firm- nefs of parts and other circumftances ren- der the entrance of the pins difficult, the inftrument, termed by the French Porte- aiguille, very effedlually removes this in- VoL. IIL C convenience.

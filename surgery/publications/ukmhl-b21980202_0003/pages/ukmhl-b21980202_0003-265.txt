SeÂ£t. III. from external Violence^ 267 In cumftance alone, little or no dependence fhould be placed upon it. In the management of fradlures of the fkull attended with depreflion, the indi- cations are, 1. To difcover as exactly as poflibie the fite, the courfe, and the full extent of the fradlure. 2. To obviate the efiedls of the injury done to the brain, by elevating.or remo- ving all the deprefled parts of the bone. 3. To endeavour to complete the cure by the application of proper dreflings, and attention to the after-treatment. Thefe are the objefts which we ought to have in view. In many inftances, in- deed, we are prevented by the fituation of the fradture and other circumftances from effeding them ^ but in others, when thefe indications can be accompliflied, we are frequently able to afford more effec- tual relief to patients, than it is ever in our power to do in the treatment of any other malady.

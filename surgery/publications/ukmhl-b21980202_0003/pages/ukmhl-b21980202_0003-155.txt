Sedl. VIII. Of Blood-letting, 157 SEC- parts, for the moft part proves effedual. zdy When the patient does not confent to this, we have it always in our power to fecure the bleeding vefTel with a ligature, as would bedone with an artery accident- ally divided in any part q£ the body. And, laftly, when the patient will not confent to either of thefe, we may, by regular continued preflure, obliterate the catity of the artery at the point where the open- ing was made, and thus produce an accre-r tion of its fides. Different bandages have been contrived for comprefllng the tem- poral artery ^ but none of them anfwer the purpofe fo well as the one reprefented in Plate'V. fig. 2. As fome tim’e, however, is required to obliterate the cavity of an artery, this method is accordingly more tedious : but with timid patients It proves more accept- able than either of the other two. Having thus confidered the various means employed for evacuating blood from the larger arteries and veins, we now proceed to the confideration of topi- pal blood-letting.

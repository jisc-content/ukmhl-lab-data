64 sudden and eventual deaths which have been caused by chloroform^ that he considers a substitute for it unneces- sary, nor is it likely that the idea of its employment being less troublesome than that of congelation can have any weight with him. On ordinary occasions this may be so; but at other times, and particularly when the life of the pa- tient is suspended or lost by the proceeding, more trouble and anxiety are caused by chloroform in one case of the kind than by congelation in fifty. An assistant conversant with the freezing process may, indeed, be desirable in important operations; but, from his attention not being exclusively occupied in watching the anesthesia, as is generally the case in the administration of chloroform, his services would be available in other ways. To complete the comparison of chloroform with congela- tion, the objection may be noticed which has been made to the latter, that its application is painful. Though this may be often true as respects freezing by ether-spray, it does not apply to the slight and transient tingling produced by a freezing mixture. But the greatest pain from ether would be preferred by most patients to the choking sensation often produced by chloroform—to the prostrating, and sometimes fatal, sickness which frequently follows its administration— and to the feeling that their consciousness will be lost, per- haps not to be regained in this world. In illustration of the last of these accompaniments of the exhibition of chloroform and other general ansesthetics, re- ference may be made to a report in the Standard of the 22nd of last month, of an inquest on a death from me- thylene administered for the amputation of a finger. As the brain and every other organ were found on examina- tion 'post mortem to be in a state of perfect health^^, the smilingly ask, when the operation is over, " When are you going to begin"—to have a nail torn away^ and look on and laugh while that most painful operation is proceeding—these are marvels of which none have dreamed. No extravagance of fiction equals this reality'' (page 34),

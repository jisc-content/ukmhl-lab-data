62 into disrepute, but they have also, though most unreason- ably, thrown discredit on the principle itself of local anaes- thesia. Notwithstanding the obvious injustice of condemn- ing a therapeutical principle because one of the means of carrying it out—and probably the only means they have tried—is defective, some enthusiastic partisans of chloro- form have not scrupled to do so when comparing local with general anaesthesia. A conspicuous example of this is afforded in a recent edition of a popular French treatise on operative surgery. The author of this work states that local anaesthesia by congelation has not been generally adopted, first, because the means of refrigeration are com- plicate j and secondly, because their ana9sthetic effect is uncertain. Both of these assertions are most erroneous as respects congelation by freezing mixtures, and both are strikingly opposed to the opinion of his countryman Yel- peau, the highest modern surgical authority in France, who, after fifteen years' experience of their use, spoke of them as un moyen d^anaesthesie tres simple et tres efflcace^' {Union Medicale smd Gazette des HopitauXj March 27, 1866). A bit of ice dipped once or twice in salt, and slightly pressed on the skin for about a minute, congeals it, and answers perfectly in many small operations. This is the sim- plest proceeding in surgery, all the apparatus required for its convenient execution being a handkerchief or a glove. Nor, when required for more important operations, can a mixture of a sufficient quantity of pulverised ice and salt, applied by means of a thin gauze net; or, very neatly, when the part is in a vertical position, by means of a wide- mouthed bottle, be justly reckoned a complicate or trou- blesome measure. And, in regard to efficacy, a freezing mixture, properly prepared and applied, will as certainly produce complete insensibility in all operations, whether by the knife or caustic, not involving deep-seated parts, aS is produced by chloroform. It is true that, as in the deeper operations, it is only the pain from cutting the skin and

63 subcutaneous tissues which can be prevented by congelation^ it becomes a question whether the patient about to submit to such an operation should endure a slight and tolerable pain (which is all that is felt when the deep-seated parts are in a healthy condition), or_, in order to obtain perfect ease, should hazard his life by inhaling chloroform. In determin- ing this point, it would be well to recollect the inscription on the tomb of the Italian, who, not content with tolerably good health, had recourse to powerful drugs in order to render it perfect: I was well—I wished to be better—Here I am/^ When the pain from an operation can be certainly and entirely prevented by congelation, as in the forcible extrac- tion of the great toe-nail, it is difficult to account for its not being always employed in preference to chloroform. I have adduced this instance because, notwithstanding the publication, seventeen years ago, of the details of five cases of death from chloroform given for it (which are adverted to in one of my writings on local anaesthesia of that date); and, notwithstanding the numerous reports by various surgeons in the medical journals, about the same time, of the com- plete insensibility in this very painful operation always pro- duced by a freezing mixture, I find chloroform still recom- mended in a recent systematic treatise of great authority. Is not this evidence of the discredit into which local anaes- thesia has fallen from the defective method lately employed for producing it; the distinguished author of the work alluded to clearly showing, by his remarks on the subject, that he has had no practical acquaintance with the original method ?* It cannot be supposed, after the hundreds of * Sir William Jenner, in his lately published address on the Progress of Medical Science, illustrates Local Anaesthesia by the following graphic description of its use in this particular operation: "The electric tele- graph, the second greatest marvel of our time, was a thing which, in a rough way, scientific men had long thought possible ; but to be cut for stone, and know nothing of the agony—to have, a leg removed, and

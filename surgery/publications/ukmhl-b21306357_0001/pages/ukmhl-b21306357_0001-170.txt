There may, in a simple attack of inflammation from cold or other similar causes, be such obstacles to recovery, arising from the previous state of the constitution, as shall, if we suc- ceed, require all our skill. But the surgeon has peculiai difficulties to contend with, and these, I fear, are too much overlooked in treatises on inflammation. It is one thing to reason on this disease in the abstract, or lay down rules for the management of it in general, and anothei thing to understand and cure it when it succeeds to an wound or important injury. The part may instantly be disorganized and crushed; there may be much local concussion ; a great shock to the general system ; a complication of injuries dis- tant; as well as distinct from one another; and all rendering the accession of inflammation dangerous beyond the ordinary degree, and its removal difficult in proportion to its danger. It is in the treatment of these cases that the nicety , ol suigerj is required, and, that deep attention, sound science, and a o-ood judgment are essential to the preservation of the patient. And if I wished, as assuredly I do, to impress the mind ol a student with the importance and difficulty of Ins profession, would not set before him the delicacy of an operation, nor the pains and lingering sufferings of a hopeless and a helpless disease, but I would place him at once in the field of batt e, or in an hospital filled by some extensive'acadent at a public WOrk and there I would allow him to study the effects o, inflammation, and the power of the different means employee by the surgeons who attended. He would there discover, when the shock was not immediately and necessarily a a that inflammation was the grand agent of destruction; tha in the slighter cases, the rules he had learned in the schools, proved effectual in the theatre of practice, but that in moie

36 After all the consideration I have given to the subject, I am disposed to consider it as a general rule, that inflamma- tion originating in the cellular texture, and produced by a cause acting exclusively on it, is in general circumscribed within limits, not very greatly beyond the operation of that cause. When this texture is extensively affected, either the cause has been extensively applied, or the affection is in a great measure, if not entirely secondary, depending on spread- ing and extended disease of another texture, such as the subjacent fascia, or the venous or absorbent system of the limb, or it is connected with the state of the cutaneous nerves, induced either by direct injury, or dependant on the condi- tion of the system. When the cellular substance is extensively inflamed, there is general swelling of the limb, with tension, and considerable, sometimes severe pain, aggravated by very slight pressure. The surface is not necessarily discoloured, but from the distension it is shining or polished. The heat is increased sometimes to 104Â°. If an incision be made at this time, only blood and serum are discharged, and no diminu- tion of the swelling takes place, for the cells are filled with fibrin and albumen. In the course of time, the surface becomes redder, and sometimes one or more parts become harder, and more prominent than the rest, as if the disease were concentrating, and these end in suppuration. Often the limb which is universally swelled and tense, becomes at one part more elastic, as if matter were contained, but this is by no means a certain evidence of that: softening, with redness of the skin, and more decided feeling of fluctuation, or a mixture of that with elasticity, are better marks. We may perhaps best understand this extensive disease, by attending to some of the circumstances under which it appears. A very frequent cause, seems to be the wound or ligature of a vein, and therefore we would at once say, that it was dependant on inflammation of the vein; but this, though a very frequent attendant, is by no means always met with, and therefore it is not essential: inflammation ol the absorbents is sometimes distinctly seen, but neither is this necessary, and in a great many cases, the absorbent, when

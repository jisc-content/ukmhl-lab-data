420 Next day, when the body was to have been judicially exam- ined, some warmth was felt about the thorax, on which account the dissection was delayed some hours, during which the man fortunately revived, and got well without operation. Many other instances might be added to this of a natural cure; and we have even examples where a limb has been amputated, and no vessel has required to be tied. It is doubtful, how- ever, whether in such a case, the main artery may not have been either obliterated, or greatly contracted. It is familiar, also, to every surgeon, that division of arteries by gunshot wounds, or by violent laceration produced by machinery, pour out comparatively little blood, and are ol all otheis most susceptible of natural obliteration. CHAP. IX. OF ANEURISM, AND THE ARTIFICIAL MEANS OF RESTRAINING HEMORRHAGE. r When a natural cure cannot be obtained, and the external wound is small, immediate death is prevented by the closing of that wound either by a coagulum or by artificial means, and thus it often heals. But the wound in the artery does not heal, and it has already poured out blood into the sur- rounding cellular substance. This soon separates, to a greater or less extent, the muscles, and detaches the fascia more or less rapidly and extensively, according to its resistance. Where the fascia is thin and almost cellular, and affords little resist- ance! the blood insinuates itself extensively below it, and may form a very diffused tumour. But where the fascia is firm and efficient, the tumour is more circumscribed, and seldom acquires a great size; but whatever its size may be, it acquires it rapidly, and remains for a time stationary. Some portion of the blood may insinuate itself between the fascia and the skin, producing ecchymosis, but this is soon absorbed. he

142 condition of the vascular system is sometimes simple excite- ment, sometimes that species of it which may be called irrita- tion ; and it has been already noticed, that certain degrees of inflammation in particular organs, seem to produce a state of the system which cannot be called pure fever, or at least synocha, but a combination of fever and irritation, marked by more restless uneasiness of body, and teazing sensation, and irritability of mind, than we should expect from the degree of fever, or the severity of the local inflammation. This irritation, however, is very injurious, and soon occasions more fever, and in certain cases it is attended by shivering, although no suppuration be going on. When this state is not produced by bloodletting, but occurs early in the disease, it is generally greatly mitigated, and often almost instantly removed by the loss of blood. But when it comes on in the progress of the disease, and after depletion, we shall generally succeed best by removing all additional sources of irritation, such as indurated faeces, by preserving in a due state the action of the alimentary canal, and by the exhibition of opiates combined with diaphoretics, such as Doverâ€™s powder. Finally, with regard to bloodletting, let it be remembered that it can do very little good, so long as any exciting cause of inflammation or even any unnatural state exist, for these counteract its effects, or may often induce disease in other parts. Thus, if a portion of intestine be strangulated, or even incarcerated, in hernia, bleeding does not cure the inflam- mation produced by this local cause. So long as the imme- diate and exciting cause of inflammation is allowed to exist, it is not to be expected that any means can cuie the disease, and the intensity of the local disease has much influence on the state of the system. An opening was made in the abdomen of a rabbit, and a loop of intestine drawn out, and retained, but covered with the integuments. No material disorder was produced, but on turning off again the integuments, after twenty-four hours, and exposing the intestine, which had adhered to the surface of the parietes, and at the opposite sides of the loop, it was found red and inflamed; the inflam- mation increased, and the animal died in about thirty-six

422 could not obstruct the circulation in the upper end, so as to produce obliteration, may be sufficient to do so in the under one; and, in point of fact, we often find, if a false aneurismal sac be formed, that tying the artery above, whilst it obliterates the upper part, does also so restrain the retro- grade circulation, as to allow time for the obliteration of the under portion, through the medium of coagulation, more or less universal, within the sac. But in wounds of large arteries, this can only be depended on when the sac has become lined to a considerable degree, which may facili- tate the closing up of the inferior aperture with coagula, and the filling of the whole sac with solid blood. In open wounds, it is still less secure, for it must be known to all, that often when the upper end only has been tied, and the patient thereby thought safe, the under one has afterwards begun to bleed. Another circumstance to be attended to is, that if by any means the flow from the superior end of the divided aiteiy can be completely checked for a time, even gi anting that permanent obliteration did not take place, the collateral branches will enlarge faster, and to a greater degree, than if the artery be less obstructed and bleed frequently. In true aneurism, it has been thought, that it was useful to delay the operation that the vessels might enlarge. Whether this be correct, or under what circumstances dela) may be piopei 01 hurtful, shall hereafter be considered; but in the present case of false aneurism, no good can come of delay. Theie is, from the very nature of the injury, little, or but slow, piogiess making in the enlargement of the collaterals, whilst the size of the tumour is augmenting, which retards the effect on the collateral branches. The neighbouring parts are becoming more disordered, and a state is induced, in which we may say, that we have rather the misfortune of tying the artery in a limb now diseased, than the benefit to be expected from enlarged vessels. The earlier that an operation is performed the better, for the injury is less, and the anastomosing ves- sels are in all probability as large naturally as they should be two months after the accident. 1 he only case in w nc 1 t lei e

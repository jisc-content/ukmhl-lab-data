257 that such proposals are useless ; but I am nevertheless strongly inclined to believe, that where bark really is to do good, it will need no corrective. The dose may rather be diminished, lor it is quite a mistake to suppose that the beneficial effect of bark or of any medicine, is in the direct ratio of the quantity swallowed. A little sulphuric acid may advantageously be given with the sulphate of quinine. Another subject of the highest importance for our consider- ation is, the proposal of separating by the knife, the dead from the living parts. When the disease advanced in spite of the remedies that were employed, almost the whole of the older writers advised amputation, as a mean of stopping its pro- gless; and, with the exception of Franco, they uniformly describe this operation in their chapter on gangrene, rhe earliest writers advise that we should cut away some of he sound, rather than leave any of the diseased flesh. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Vigo, and, many years afterwards, Fabricius, with a view both of saving pain, and preventing hemorrhage, proposed to cut rather in the dead than in the living parts. It is quite clear, that on the princi- ple of amputation being a remedy for gangrene, this plan CO Id never be attended with success, inasmuch as there was still a diseased surface left; and, in point of fact, the only i eience was, that the quantity of gangrene was greater >c °ie than after the operation; but in no other respect was le case altered. Those who, in order to destroy more effectually all vestiges of the disease, as well as to check hemorrhage used the actual cautery after amputation, cer- ain y acted better up to the avowed principle. The general plan, however, was to cut at such a distance from the ganm-ene as to ensure, if possible, the division in a sound part.

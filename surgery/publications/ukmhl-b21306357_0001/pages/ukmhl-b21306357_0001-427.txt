411 along the tube, if it be partially emitted into the sac, or if the artery be imbedded at the bottom of the sac, pulsation may continue, but not always, in the same way. It blood be poured into the sac in any degree, or be in any degree trans- mitted through it, there will be pulsation in the sac as in a true aneurism. But if little or no blood enter the sac, but the artery at its bottom pulsate, that pulsation may be com- municated to the sac, as to any other tumour. There is motion or pulsation of the sac rather than in it. When, on the other hand, the sac is tense, and well lined with coagula, and the blood passes with scarcely any impetus along the tube within it, and rather oscillates than flows even in a small stream from the orifice, the pulsation stops, although the artery be not obliterated. It thus happens, that a false aneurism at fffst may pulsate strongly, and after a time may cease to pulsate at all, yet without any tendency to a natural cure. And farther, if, by the more defined connexion of the inferior aperture of a divided, or partially divided artery, which may take place by the coat of effused fibrin, any thing like a direct transmission be re-established, the pulsation may again return. Seventh, It follows, from the view I have given, that there are two obstacles to the natural cure or obliteration of the artery, namely, a partial transmission of blood from the sac into the inferior aperture, or along the tube, in a case of punc- ture, and the continuation of a little blood flowing even at intervals from the upper orifice into the dilatable sac; and were it not for this second cause, it is evident that a com- plete division, or entire and lacerated rupture of an arterial trunk, might often be cured spontaneously by the blood coagu- lating in the sac or cavity. The orifice or tube of the artery does not become very rapidly obliterated, and therefore, although we had the transmission along the upper end of either a punctured or divided artery suspended for many hours, yet the tube is not contracted, nor its sides in contact nor the process of adhesion or obliteration even begun. The first effort to displace the clot succeeds, and if even a spoonful of blood flow, the patient is no better than lie was a week before

we never have adhesion unless that be absorbed, but we find it sticking to one of the surfaces, whilst between it and the other, more or less serum, or watery fluid, is interposed. Adhe- sion, also, never takes place it any serous fluid be secieted in such quantity as to accumulate, or until it be absorbed. This is well illustrated in inflammation of the eye, which exhibits the changes produced on serous membrane. In this case we find, that if the inflammation be high, the whole surface of the conjunctiva becomes very vascular and tumid, and at last thick and soft like velvet, and here and there we find even some blood extravasated under the membrane, or into its layers, producing deeper coloured spots. Weie the tunica vaginalis of the testicle in this state, adhesion would quickly take place, for any interposed fluid would soon be absorbed, and being furnished by surfaces in a state of inflammation, and tending to union, if the secreting action became at all sus- pended, adhesion would immediately take place. But in the eye this is prevented, for the secretion of tears or fluid still goes on, and insinuates itself between the inflamed surfaces, from a gland which is not impeded in its secretion by the inflamma- tion which there exists, and which continues to act notwith- standing high inflammation of the surfaces. This circumstance of a serous fluid always preventing adhesion, as it must ever mechanically, independently of other ways do, when it con- tinues to be formed by the membrane, accounts for the occasional failure of the attempt to cure hydrocele by injection ; for unless the inflammation run so high as to check the secre- tion, and unless adhesion take place during this high stage, and before the inflammation subside so far as to allow, in any decree, the re establishment of serous secretion, we are sure to have, either over the whole sui'face, or at portions, a failure of adhesion, on which the cure depends. Another mode of effecting union, is by what has been called the second intention, that is by the formation of granulations, which has been already considered under the process of ulceration. I now only advert to it as a mean of closing apertures by a gradual contraction. The principle here is to prevent the introduction of any extraneous substance

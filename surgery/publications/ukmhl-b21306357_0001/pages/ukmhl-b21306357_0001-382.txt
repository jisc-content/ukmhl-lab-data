fished, that by the operation of certain local causes, a local disease having all the characters or appearances of scrofula, may be induced in those who have neither in their own per- sons, nor for time immemorial in their forefathers, exhibited indications of the diatheses; and such people, if they after- wards have children, may communicate to them a decided diathesis. Thus far goes the fact, but we are not yet compe- tent to decide whether the diathesis have in a slight degree existed, even for generations, and only been called into acti- vity by the peculiar and favourable circumstances for it, under which the individual was placed; or, whether, like cancer and some other tumours, it may not often arise directly in the part by the operation of certain causes, producing a local scrofula, ending either in cachexia, or diathesis, or both. In whatever way we dispose of the question, I am persuaded that there is no person in whom scrofulous disease may not take place. We must refer the peculiarity of hereditary constitution to that of the nervous system, and, if we refine, more especially to the condition of that portion, which is first developed in the foetus, and this we know to be the spinal cord. That this does itself often suffer from the effects of diathesis directly, or by the action of its vessels, or changes in its coats, &c. is w-ell known. But I would go farther, and although I cannot prove it, offer as a plausible conjecture that it is to the primary, or that essential part of the nervous system which is first deve- loped, and without which life cannot continue, or growth take place, that we are to look for the seat of the diathesis, or the immediate cause of hereditary disease. That excitement, and peculiar conditions of the origins of the nerves, should pro- duce changes at their extremities, is not only conceivable, but is founded on facts acknowledged in every system of physiology. That such excitement or peculiarity of action _ at the origin of nerves can produce increased secretion, inor- dinate muscular action, or inflammation with its consequences, cannot be denied by any who consider the history of cephalic disease, in which we have frequently, increased secretion of bile, harassing vomiting, inflammation and abscess of the liver.

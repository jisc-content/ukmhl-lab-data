The same remark holds true with regard to the tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle, when the scalp is affected. This is more dangerous, in proportion as it affects parts remote from the heart, and of languid circula- tion.

Bloodletting is seldom admissible. If ever, it is only in the very first stage, and to a moderate extent.

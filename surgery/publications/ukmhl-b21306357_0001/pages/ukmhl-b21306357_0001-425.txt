409 may exist, but it is soon displaced, and the smallest quantity of blood flowing from the orifice, even once a day, would pre- vent the cure. Fourth, But the hope of a natural cure is farther dimin- ished by a change which may take place in the condition of the under orifice. This is not shut up after the injury, but can transmit blood in a retrograde way, although its unfavour- able entanglement, in a mesh of lacerated substance and clots, may prevent it from receiving blood. But when, after a time, the cavity, formed by the effused blood, or the false aneurism, as it has been called, comes to be defined and lined by fibrin and layers of coagulum, the mouth of the infeiioL division of the artery becomes more regularly and smoothly connected with the sac, and now, if that be laid open, both oiâ€™ifices are found leading into a defined, though not regu- larly shaped sac, and are connected with it by a continu- ous surface, formed by fibrin and solid blood, and at this period, and under these circumstances, arterial blood may pass from the upper orifice through the sac, and thence by the under orifice down into the limb which thus is supplied not only by the enlarged collateral branches, as happened in the first stage, but also by a direct circulation, which will thus check the increase of the sac, and, likewise, the progressive enlargement of the collateral branches, in a degree propor- tioned to the renewal of the direct circulation, and put a com- plete stop to all hopes of a spontaneous cure. This circumstance of the extremity of an artery becoming continuous, with an expansion of fibrin, is of importance to be attended to in those cases where the sac is opened, for the purpose of tying the wounded vessel. If the ligature be applied around this fibrinous mouth of the vessel, or rather appendage to it, the substance is immediately torn, or if it were not, no adhesion being capable of taking place, the ligature would soon come off, and the bleeding be renewed. In all cases, therefore, where the mouth of the vessel is to be exposed, we must be sure that we really have removed the coating of fibrin, and have laid hold of, or insulated the tube or vessel itself. It also follows, that in all cases where we

407 the comparative size of the wounded artery, and it may be useful to inquire into the process by which an artery is obliterated. It is necessary to consider well the consequences of an wound of an artery; and there can be little hesitation in starting with the assertion, that all wounds do impair the circulation, and some of them prevent altogether the trans- mission of blood by the wounded trunk; and, according to the degree of interruption, will be the immediate effect of producing a cold and pulseless state of the limb. I offer the following observations for illustration of the case : First, The artery may be punctured, or partially wounded. In this case blood is immediately effused over the vessel which is covered, if not surrounded by blood, if the external wound be closed. The artery pours out into the sac thus formed by the extravasated blood more and more in proportion as the parts admit of distention, but it does not do so constantly and unremittingly. A coagulum forms in the orifice of the vessel, and over it, so that virtually the canal, though narrowed, is for a time rendered once more entire. If the circulation be languid, or the artery not powerfully acted on, it is ascertained that a very small coagulum may prevent the flow. Thus, even in the femoral artery, no haemorrhage may take place when the wound of the thigh is enlarged or the bloody sac opened, and this not from the calibre of the vessel being plugged with blood, for it is still transmitting blood, as we discover from the effect of applying a ligature below the wound or puncture, for then the blood spouts out; and this transmission of blood, and interruption of the flow into the sac, or by the wound, may be greatly assisted by the sheath of the artery coming to supply, in part, the deficiency of the proper coat of the artery by overlapping the orifice in the tube, or confining blood between itself and the artery and causing a clot. If, on the other hand, the inside have been filled with a clot, and the circulation interrupted at the time, no instant renewal follows the ligature. The same happens if the sides of the vessel have been so compressed by a coagulum externally, as not to have permitted, at the time, the circulation, even in a slight

456 merely undulated at each motion, backward and forward, going from the upper end of the artery, or its mouth, into the sac, and back again into the end of the vessel at the systole of the sac, a pulsation should be produced, the sac appearing to the finger to expand, or strike the finger by an expansive force acting within. This pulsation, or apparent distention, may be perceived either in any part of the sac, or only at the thinest part, according to the state of the coagula; and this leads me to observe, that when the cavity is thickly lined with a layer of coagulum, and becomes more solid and resisting, this kind of pulsation may cease, and a more dull general elevation of the mass, may take place at each pulsation, just as a solid large gland would rise and fall by the pulsation of the artery below it; or no such motion may take place, and the aneurismal tumour may remain as quiet and free from pulsa- tion, as a chronic abscess or solid tumour situated far from any large artery. This explains how we may have, in false aneurism, produced by the puncture or wound of a large artery, first strong and well marked pulsation, so as even to raise the bedclothes, then the pulsation may become obscure, and, next, we may have a general elevation of the tumour, rather than a pulsation of its parietes. We may also under- stand why, in certain cases of false aneurism,'there may be no distinct pulsation from first to last. The pulsation of true, is much more easily understood than of false aneurism, for there is a circumscribed sac, forming still a part of the artery, and if the blood move at all, it moves in what, virtually, may be considered as an enlargement of the artery, and the pulsation is of the same kind with that of an artery. It is of great importance to attend to this, for it assists, and often determines the diagnosis. If the finger be laid on the face of the tumour, it is perceived to pulsate, and the impulse seems to come from within. The pulsation is inherent in the tumour. If we apply the finger and thumb to the sides of the tumour, or at any distance we choose from one another laterally, we still feel the pulsation; the tumour appears to expand laterally at every arterial diastole. If we press on the course of the artery below the tumour, the pul-

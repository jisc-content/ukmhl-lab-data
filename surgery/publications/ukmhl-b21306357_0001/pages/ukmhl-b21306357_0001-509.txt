493 made with comparative impunity. The mere lopping off of the member, by the immediate abridgment of the quantity of living body, the instant loss of so large a portion, which was formerly acting along with'the system, is productive of serious evil to it, from the sympathy which universally prevails. But if the nervous system become in part torpid, so as to prevent this sympathy, or to be incapable of maintaining it, the loss of a member, or, what is in one respect the same, the loss of its connexion with the system, and its failure in power, and action, and sensibility, may not have the same bad effect. Hence a sudden paralysis, not only of a whole limb, but of one side, does not necessarily subject the patient to the same hazard with the amputation of a large extremity, for the cause is of sucl^ a nature as to prevent the operation of sym- pathy. If this kind of shock, supervene immediately on the other, and particularly by the performance of amputation during the period of sinking or failure, death may follow in less than an hour ; but in this case, it is rather from the first kind of shock or failure, than the second. When time is allowed for the second to appear, it is later after the injury or amputation, and it does not destroy by direct sink- ing, as in the former case, but by a species of reaction or excitement, sometimes universal, sometimes more directed against particular organs. It is marked by rapid pulse, rest- lessness, general uneasiness, sometimes vomiting, and much depression, or there may supervene organic alteration in the liver, lungs, &c. followed by dropsical effusion or other effects, but these I shall notice presently under a different head. Opiates, purges, and bleeding may be necessary, and the excitation is sometimes communicated to the stump, or por- tion of the member left, producing swelling, tension, and engorgement of blood, attended sometimes with heat, some- times rather with coldness, of the integuments. On this subject, I must also notice that complication which may arise from intoxication ; and here I observe, that however that may influence the degree of shock, it does not in this respect affect our decision ; for, from whatever cause, or com- plication of causes, the shock is produced, we must be guided

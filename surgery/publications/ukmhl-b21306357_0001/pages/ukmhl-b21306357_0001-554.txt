538 turgescence or excitement, &c. is to produce pain, for in some cases, where that is not the consequence, severe, and almost tetanic convulsions may take place; or in whatever way we may explain the fact, we find that a dreadful feeling of weight or distention is produced within the head, or in place of pain in an extremity, or referred to any viscus in the thorax or abdo- men, we have agonizing pain in the head, or a feeling as if melted lead were poured on the brain.

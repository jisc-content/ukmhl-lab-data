5 04 and means ihe power of shrinking or contracting by the appli- cation of a stimulus; and therefore the term, looking to etymo- logy, "is not very well applied figuratively, for the pheno- mena would rather indicate fear than resentment. Mr. Hunter gives no precise definition of irritability as a principle, but apparently confining himself to the state of irritability, says, it is “ overaction to the strength of the part,” that is, if the words have any meaning, it is action beyond the power of the part to perform and sustain; and speaking of an irritable habit, he says, it is “ an increased disposition to act, without the power to act with,” which, setting aside all verbal criticism and discus- sion as to phraseology» evidently confounds an irritable with a very susceptible habit, and makes the state of irritation to be synonymous with that of too high excitement. He, and along with him, more modern authors, have gone back to the doc- trine of Glisson, and make irritability and susceptibility syno- nymous terms, and irritation to consist in that state which is produced by an extraordinary excitement of the principle of irritability. That is, one and all of them would make it include the effects of dancing, scalding, drunkenness, and every species of excitation or stimulation. Hallei, "e have seen, made irritability and contractility synonymous; but if we confine ourselves to the legitimate meaning, we shall, as it is quite a trope, or figure of speech, be guided by the figuia- tive signification. To instate, means not merely to excite to anger, but also to vex or tease, and the effect pioduced on the mind may not be anger, but rather a state of teasing exas- peration or fretfulness. A state of bodily irritation is not a mere state of stimulation, for that may be very agreeable, but, if I may indulge in figurative language, a fretting, teasing, vexatious condition, a disagreeable, perhaps harassing modifi- cation of excitement, which, although it may sometimes be produced by a peculiarity of local pain, does not itself consist in pain, more than fretting or irritation of the mind consists in fury, and, least of all, can it be confounded with pleasurable excitement. If this be irritation of body, then an irritable habit, which we so often hear of, is not one merely peculiarly susceptible of all stimuli, or one which may simply be called

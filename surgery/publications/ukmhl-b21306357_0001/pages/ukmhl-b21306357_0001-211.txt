is considerable, the scars forbid the practice in parts which are to be seen, and I know the haemorrhage to be in some cases troublesome, and instances I see published where it has been fatal. 1 arther, such incisions and punctures cannot be otherwise than attended with irritation. Who should expect to cure a phlegmon by cutting it up ; and yet where is the great dissi- milarity of the two cases ? I apprehend that the practice will e united to hospitals, and there only with propriety used in extensive erysipelas-of the phlegmonoid kind, as it has been called, when of a high degree, and at an early period. Inci- sions made with a view of evacuating matter, or giving issue to slough of the cellular substance, stand on a different ground, and can seldom, if ever be wrong. When the erysipelas seems disposed to spread fast and far, it is a easible proposal to arrest its progress by destroying a narrow line of skin, and the narrower the better, around it by caustic, as it may be supposed that the cutaneous inflammation could not pass the line of circumvallation formed by the now dead eschar. Tins may be true in some cases, and should be true in every instance, if the inflammation could only travel alono- the cutis, and not along the subcutaneous texture, or if there existed no such condition of the cutaneous nerves as to induce disease 1.1 the neighbourhood, without actual propagation from atom to atom. Not exactly on this principle, but rather on that of inducing a modified inflammation in the boundary, it has oeen proposed to apply a blister on that boundary, but we have not yet had such experience of the effect as to establish the practice. Still less can we trust another modern practice, ar from harmless, of applying a firm bandage round the m amed limb, by way, J presume, of contracting the dis- tended and debilitated vessels.

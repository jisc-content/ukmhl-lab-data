176 merely on the action of the chylopoietic viscera. It was an ancient opinion, that erysipelas depended on the presence of bile, but this is quite disproved by the fact, that jaundice is not attended with erysipelas. It may from this alone be decided, that bile does not necessarily, or without other aid, produce this inflammation. Next, it may be inquired, whether excitement of the liver is peculiarly a cause, or whether the redundancy of bile, where it exists, and any alteration in the function of the liver, be not, as well as the erysipelas, mere effects of disorder in the alimentary canal; or whether, even in those cases where disease of the liver is known to exist, that does not act by influencing the stomach and duodenum. It is probable that the modus operandi is not always the same, and that sometimes the liver, and sometimes the bowels, are the primary cause; but generally, I believe, it is through the sympathy, direct or indirect, of the alimentary canal with the skin, that erysipelas, when it is dependant on gastric irritation, is produced, and the bilious symptoms, as they are called, are merely concomitant effects. In corroboration of this opinion, I observe, that certain kinds of aliment, and some irritating substances taken into the stomach, excite exanthemata; and again the uterus, as well as the liver, when diseased, is capable of producing the same effect, which is probably by influencing the stomach and bowels. If this view of cutaneous inflammation be correct, it may be deduced as a practical rule, that we may generally, by the co-operation of local remedies, safely endeavour to check that which arises from irritation in the immediate neighbourhood of the affection, or from any cause in general not internal; whilst that which proceeds from disorder of the alimentary canal, or any other internal cause, cannot be judiciously or safely attacked or repelled, as it is called, by local means alone, without the use of such remedies as shall contribute to the removal of that cause ; for till that be done, there is reason to fear that, even if driven from one part, it would be apt to appear in another, or, that diseased action might be thrown on a vital organ, with which both the skin and the alimentary

350 \ useless, and if given for any length of time, so as to affect the system, is sometimes productive of fatal debility. Mercury is still worse, for it never cures, and very often exasperates the disease. I object to all these specifics, as they are called, not merely because they, in one way or other, do positive mischief, but also because they prevent the patient from having recourse, in proper time, to an operation, which alone, in the present state of our knowledge, holds out any prospect of success. But if the patient will not submit to this, or if the time when it could have been performed, have been lost, what plan ought we to follow? I have already spoken of the means to be employed for promoting the absorption, or removal of a simple induration, and thus preventing a termination in cancer. But when scirrho-cancer is produced, if an operation be not performed, the only beneficial system we can follow is that which shall longest retard the progress of the disease. We cannot produce its absorption; we know nothing which can change its action; but we know well, that general stimu- lants, or local irritations, or whatever can impair the health and correctness of the system, or the action of particular sym- pathizing viscera, can accelerate the progress of the cancer. Our object, therefore, must be to improve, as far as we can, the general health, which I believe in the present instance, is chiefly to be done by moderate exercise, of such a kind as does not excite the part affected, by strict attention to diet, avoid- ing whatever is indigestible, acescent, oi stimulating, and promoting digestion, and the due action of the chylopoietic viscera, by mild laxatives, and perhaps sarsaparilla. This plan, when it branches out into the various dietetic direc- ctions which it may be necessary to give to different indivi- duals, and into the prescriptions which, though simple, may require occasionally to be changed, will surely be quite suffi- cient to obviate the objection, which I supposed to be started to my assertion, that we can prescribe nothing capable of curing a cancer, and that leaving the patient without prescrip- tion, and without advice, was leaving her without any thing which could afford a medical employment for the mind. I have made the unqualified assertion, that at present we know

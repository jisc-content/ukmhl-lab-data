110 already, in pointing out the effect of communication of action, illustrated this point, and have only two remarks to offer ; the first is, that there is no degree of debility compatible with life, which is ever found to prevent inflammation, if an exciting cause be applied. The second is, that whenever an organ is by any cause sunk in its power and action below the rest, it is not only liable, from the circumstance already pointed out, to inflammation, but it even is necessary to take positive pre- cautions to prevent its accession. It will immediately be started as an objection, that we ought to have a state of debi- lity predisposing to inflammation, or that the most debili- tated ought to be most liable to inflammation. This is not fairly brought. The proposition was not general, that the universally weak were, in consequence of this debility, prone to inflammation, but it was, that inequality of debility gave a predisposition ; that whilst a debilitated system did not exempt from inflammation, a debilitated part or organ in a system was peculiarly liable to it. Whilst I adopt the position that the feeble not only are not exempted from inflammation, but often are peculiarly liable to it, I would farther explain, that there is a complicated con- dition of debility, arising from loss of blood, which, in a spe- cial manner, is attended with a proneness to this disease. We have an unnatural and excited state of the arterial system, produced by the efforts made to contract and accommodate itself to its diminished contents, and the effect of this ought to be proportionate to the rapidity and extent of the diminu- tion, and, consequently, of the effort required. This does produce a state of general excitement, marked by heat of the skin, and frequency of the pulse, which is often small, always weak, easily compressed, and either sharp or throbbing. It is not difficult to comprehend how this condition of the system should render local disease easily produced, or predispose to inflammation ; and when inflammation does occur, we are very much curbed in the use of one of the most powerful remedies employed for the removal of that disease.

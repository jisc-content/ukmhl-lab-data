The eyelids sometimes participate in svvdl °mp aint’ and the glaUdS at the angle °f the Jaw Presently This is one of the most formidable diseases we are acquainted ’ no medicine, no regimen, no plan of treatment what- evei, has the smallest control over it. It is worse than folly to postpone for a single instant, an operation, after the nature of the complaint is ascertained. I grant that the diagnosis is not always easy at first; it may be mistaken for a deep sup- puration, or an encysted tumour, but if a puncture be made to let out the supposed fluid, only a few drops of bloody serum are discharged, and very soon an excrescence protrudes. When we are doubtful, then, as to the nature of the tumour, a small puncture should at once be made, and we ought m be prepared, if necessary, immediately to remove the disease. Nothing but an early and complete extirpation can afford the smallest hope of life. When the disease is seated on a limb we should rarely undertake its excision, but at once perform amputation. Cancer is a dreadful disease, but this is worse, for relapses are still more frequent. When we operate, we must always be careful to go completely beyond the seat of the disease. If we expose a muscle, and find it in any degree altered in its texture, we do nothing if we do not remove completely every thing which has the slightest appearance of disease. There are very few instances, I believe, of perma- nent success attending operations performed after excrescences had taken place. SECTION NINTH.

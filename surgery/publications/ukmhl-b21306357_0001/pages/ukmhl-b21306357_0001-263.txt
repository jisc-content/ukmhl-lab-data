24-7 slowly; or if somewhat more rapid in its progress, it gains giound chiefly by the mere influence of the moribund part on the part which is immediately beyond it; and were we to cut at a considerable distance from this, we should cut in parts comparatively healthy. Second, there may be keen constitu- tional sympathy, and no part either of the member or of the frame may be in a state capable of resisting a fresh injury. e have m this case the disease spreading, not simply by the s) mpat ly of moribund parts on those immediately adjacent, which they found, and acted on, in a state free from peculiar predisposition, but, on the contrary, they and the whole member are by the constitutional disorder ready prepared for the reception of the gangrene, and prone to assume the gan- grenous inflammation, on the application of any excitiim cause, w lether that consist in the propagation of action from ie parts below, or in the application of the knife of the surgeon. A practical inference from this is, that in the first case we might perform amputation, with a hope of success, at any period of the disease, provided there were mere strength enough m the system to sustain the shock of the operation, or ling m the condition of the arteries to prevent the ade- quate circulation of the blood near the stump. Whereas in the second, it is evident that an operation performed before the disease be checked, must be performed on parts in a tTchsease01 aCtUaliy dlSeaSed’ at leaSt of strong predisposition In the treatment of gangrene we must confine our views to the management of parts still living: it is on these alone, that we can exert any influence. There are two ways in 4ich ive may conduct our plan of treatment. The first is, to en- deavour to alter the nature of the gangrenous inflammation, by converting it into one of a safer kind, more disposed to end suppuration than in gangrene. The second is, to invi .orate the system, and thereby procure a greater power of resistance to the ravages of disease. These two plans mi., mutually assist each other.

512 the parts cannot assume or carry on those actions, which are necessary for their preservation and recovery, nor could the constitution exist under the effect of these actions. In this case, if amputation cannot be permitted, nothing can be hoped for; and this conviction, with a strong desire to free the system from a mortal evil, makes the surgeon more desir- ous to perform it, than a careful and dispassionate considera- tion of present debility, and future danger, can justify; and, from the best of motives, to rush upon a useless and fatal operation. Fever may follow an wound, without being dependant on inflammation, or proportioned to it; but merely arising from excitation of the origins of those nerves, influencing the action of the heart, and the secretion of heat. We have seen that fever is not a simple condition or disease, but is produced by the excitement communicated to the origins of nerves, and varies, according to the variations in the exciting cause. In- flammatory fever having been already considered, I shall chiefly make a few remarks on traumatic fever, which may neither be a state of mere irritation, or excitation, nor of actual synocha, but a middle condition. The effect of wounds, or of cuta- neous irritation on the chylopoietic viscera on the one hand, and of these upon wounds and local diseases on the other, has been long remarked. It is much to be questioned if these influences be direct, and be not rather exercised on the nerves supplying both parts. An external injury, for instance, affects, through the medium of its nerves, the state of the spinal chord, which gives off these nerves, and this again comes to influence the other nerves given off from it, or from the medulla oblongata which sympathizes with it, to distant organs, which thus become not only affected in their actions, but, by these affections, are capable of reacting on the common origin of the nerves, and thus on the external injury, produc- ing& changes on it. This opinion, which applies to an influ- ence commencing in the wound, is still more applicable to one arising, at first, from irritation of the stomach or bowels, by irregularities of diet, &c. In whatever way it originates, the ultimate effect is the same, and in both we must use means 4

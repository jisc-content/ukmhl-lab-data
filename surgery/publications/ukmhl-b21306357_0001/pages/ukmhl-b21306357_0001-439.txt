423 is any thing like the shadow of an argument in favour of delay, in expectation of enlargement of the collaterals, is that in which the tumour is stationary, and so firm as to show that there is much coagulum in it; and these two circum- stances taken together, although they cannot justify the expectation of a natural cure, may yet support the specula- tion that the circulation is so far subdued as to increase in a salutary degree the determination to the collaterals. If right in this view, it also follows, that the limb, not being as yet properly supplied by the anastomosing branches, and in no degree by the trunk, must waste, and it is to be considered how far the additional quantity of blood thrown, after the ligature, on the minute vessels, may not, considering the pre- vious state of the limb, be productive of an excitement greater than it is able to bear. The delay in operating which may or may not be allow- able in false aneurism, is positively and invariably injurious in aneurismal varix. In this species of injury, we should either operate instantly or not at all; and indeed, as we shall pre- sently see, il the how can be immediately restiâ€™ained, and the state of aneurismal varix induced, there can be no call for operation at any time. 1 he artery has been wounded through the vein: by means of pressure, these two tubes are still more firmly connected than heretofore, or, if the wound have been cleanly made, although of considerable size, the blood, even if the connexion were somewhat lax, would rea- dily find its way into the vein, whilst also by pressure, the external wound in the vein, with that in the skin, are healed. Lut the internal wound of the vein, the opening leading from it into the artery remains unclosed, and the blood flows from the artery into the vein, which is thus converted into a branch of the artery. Part of the blood passes down the artery to the branches below, but more or less, often no small quantity, enters the veins, and mixes with the venous blood, and flows with it in a direction retrograde to that in the artery. Two effects result from this; first, the trunk and branches below the wound in the artery being less fully supplied with blood, begin to contract and diminish in size, whereas, in true or t

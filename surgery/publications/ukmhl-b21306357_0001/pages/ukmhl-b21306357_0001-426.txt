410 open the cavity or sac which has been produced, or enlarge the wound at the moment, and before a false aneurism have formed, we must tie both ends of the artery, if we wish to be secure from haemorrhage. Fifth, It is not to be supposed that all wounds of an artery can run the same course. Some, sooner than others, may transmit blood directly, others do so partially from the first, and some never do so. The reason of this may be learned from what I have said; and I now particularly remark that the cellular sheath of the artery may, in certain cases of punc- tured and oblique wounds, have the aperture turned aside from that of the proper tube of the artery, and a coagulum forming between them in consequence of the detention of blood, produced by this want of correspondence, the flow of blood out of the sheath may be retarded, or for a time pre- vented, and more or less may pass down along and within the arterial canal. But, sooner or later, in all large arteries, this coagulum, which, at best, is but an uncertain and tempo- rary obstacle, is displaced to a greater or less extent, and blood is effused in a greater degree, under the aponeurosis of the limb, or flows from the external wound. If this dis- placement do not take place, and the orifice in the sheath be small, the sheath distends and forms a circumscribed sac, lined with coagulum, and, for a time, restoring, though imperfectly, the integrity of the tube and keeping up a circu- lation. In no case can we look for a cure so long as blood in any, even the smallest quantity, can flow from the superior aperture; and it can only do so either by a portion of the blood which is poured into the sac, finding its way out, or by the sac itself gradually enlarging, so as to prevent the aperture from ever being closed, there being, if not regularly, at least at short intervals, a little blood emitted from the orifice. Sixth, A false aneurism may or may not pulsate, according to circumstances. If the nature of the wound in the artery be such as to permit any thing like transmission of the blood along the punctured tube, or from one orifice to another of a divided, or partially divided artery, the pulsation must be strong and distinct. Even when blood does not find its way

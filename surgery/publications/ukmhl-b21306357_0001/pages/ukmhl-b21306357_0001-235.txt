A less intense degree of pain and excitement may produce! fatal exhaustion, without mortification, and quite independent of any inflammation which may have commenced. Inflam- mation preceded or accompanied with great pain, must there- fore soon be considered in the same light with that disease supervening in a part weakened by cold or mechanical injury, and it is evident then, that parts naturally of great sensibility, or which have acquired it, must perish sooner under inflam- mation than others less sensible; and if this be admitted, it follows, that much attention should practically be paid to pain, in all complaints which tend to kill the part, and in all oigans, whatevei the disease may be, which excite a powerful sympathy on the system, or are essential to it. The same degree of pain which may for a length of time be sustained in suppuiative and ulcerative disease, would soon destroy the same part, if complicated with inflammation. Adventitious circum- stances often increase pain, and exhaust the part; thus, in ente- ritis, part of the pain proceeds from irregular action of the muscular fibres, and this debilitates still more the inflamed part. We are not merely to attend to the greater sensibility which a part may naturally possess over others, but also to its suscepti- bility of impression from stimuli, which may be very important, although the part may not be delicately sensible. It is also of much consequence to attend to the acquired sensibility and susceptibility which may take place in the progress of disease, and which are sometimes augmented after haemorrhage, by the excited state of the vascular system this produces. Hence great loss of blood is very apt to be succeeded by inflamma- tion, if a very slight cause be applied, or sometimes from the mere irregularity of action induced, in an organ itself, by the loss of blood. J epression debilitates as well as pain, and not only in inflammation sinks the part itself, but prevents the system from communicating support to it in the same degree it would ot ei wise do. Organs which are depressed easily by inflam- lvutmn or which sympathetically depress the system, as the S Â°maC 1 or smali intestines, must hence be readily sunk,

190 the prompt use of the lancet is usually safe, whilst later evacuations are hurtful; and it is as much from the mistimed employment of the remedy, as from any harm that venesec- tion as a general practice has ever done, that a prejudice has arisen against the lancet. The direction must be taken from the degree of inflammation, and the violence of the fever, rather than from the temperament; yet that must not be overlooked, for, ceteris paribus, we could bleed with more advantage in a vigorous and plethoric habit than in an oppo- site state. When the disease attacks the former, and more especially when it succeeds to exposure to cold, blood ought to be taken ; but when it occurs in the very young, or the old, or extenuated, or is attended with much depression, then evacuation is not to be practised. When the pulse is frequent and throbbing, and the heat considerable, and the local disease high, more especially when it is of the phlegmonoid kind, and the cellular texture is participating in the action, bleeding does good, and not only moderates the fever, but mitigates the local inflammation ; but it must never be pushed beyond the point of necessary mitigation, for it cannot be expected in any extent to effect an immediate cure. We must also never forget, if we bleed freely, more especially in delicate habits, or where the system has been in a state of continued excitation barely compatible with appearance of health, and ready to give way under a moderate disease, that whilst we do not cure the disease, we weaken the system, and render it less able to sustain a protracted disease, especially it suppu- ration be expected. It is only, then, in so far as we hope by mitigating the present fever and the local inflammation, to lessen the future severity, and diminish the effort to be made by the system, that venesection is to be employed. When the fever is moderate, the inflammation more confined to the cutis, and not severe, it is not required ; and when there are great depression or languor, and small pulse, and dusky hue of the part, it is hurtful. The similarity between the state of the pulse in this case and enteritis, is no argument for evacuation ; and I am well convinced, that if a positive and invariable rule were to be laid down, either to bleed all or to bleed none, the

539 are all that can be offered here, and yet these, I hope, may form a useful conclusion to the details already given. It is a plain, but important truth, that every injury, not rapidly or immediately fatal by the suspension of the perform- ance of the vital functions, every diseased or disordered action of any organ or part, may prove detrimental, or destructive, either speedily by the shock which is given, or more slowly by ex- haustion, from the nature or violence of the action, or the severity of the sensation attending it. There are, then, as we have seen, different states, which may be produced by an accident, an operation, or a disease, which may prove inju- rious, or fatal, not by the communication to the system of an action similar to the local one, or of any special action what- soever, but directly by the effect of the injury, or local con- dition, on the action and power of the system considered abstractly. These states have been already considered, under the head of shock, exhaustion, &c., and the management of the constitution under them is, in general, pretty obvious. We promote rallying, either by a negative treatment, that is, by avoiding all exertion, and farther expenditure of power, or, by the positive exhibition of cordials, &c., so as to recruit on the one hand, without unduly exciting on the other. The rule, in the case of sudden and severe sinking, is to give cordials, and apply stimulants to an extent, and so frequently, as may be necessary, not only to prevent still farther sinking, but also to enable the system to go on with the performance of the vital functions, in such a degree, and with such per- fection, as shall procure rallying, and place it in that state of comparative security, which shall empower it to continue acting without the constant aid of artificial stimuli. If we cannot accomplish the first object, the patient dies, if we go beyond the limits of the second, we may have a dangerous excitation produced. This constitutes our management of shock and sinking. Exhaustion, is more slow in its operation, and is not merely the consequence of injuries, but the effect of all undue and disordered actions. These may, indeed, prove fatal by the disorganization they produce, and the interruption they afford to the performance of functions essential to life; but they

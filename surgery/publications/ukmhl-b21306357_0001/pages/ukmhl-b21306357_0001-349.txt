333 from its peculiar hardness; carcinoma, or cancer, from some fancied resemblance to a crab. There is perhaps no part of the body where it may not originate, but it is chiefly met with in secreting organs, and of these, oftenest in the breast, next to that in the cervix uteri, the under lip, and the male testicle. In the breast it begins with enlargement, and induration of one of the glands, which becomes harder and more irregular than formerly. At first the swelling is small, but if the disease have been preceded by some previous injury, such as a blow, or the new organization be consequent to a milk abscess, there may for a long time have been an indolent swelling, comparatively soft; and in such a case, when scirrhus does take place, it is large from its first appearance. In some cases the disease is for a long time, or altogether, confined to the gand originally affected; in other cases the neighbouring parts early suffer, and the disease ultimately affects the whole breast. There is at first, perhaps, little or no pain, and the disease is only recognized by induration and enlargement, n other instances there is very early a stinging pain, which becomes more frequent and severe as the disease continues. ie gland for a length of time is moveable, and does not adhere to the skin; it feels hard, heavy, and knobbed, and usually, but not uniformly, secretes a kind of lymph, varvino- from a pellucid fluid to one of a red or brownish colour which is discharged by the nipple. After some time the tumour seems to come nearer the surface, and the skin adheres to it, so that it no longer plays freely over it; then the skin c langes its texture somewhat, becomes more shining, whiter as well as denser; next it becomes puckered, and then when the n i egulanties of the tumour project considerably, it assumes enher a leaden or dull red colour. The nipple is usually very early retracted, and at length almost buried, under the skin bull only one tumour may be discernible externally, and that may be moveable; but in other instances it adheres to the uscle below, very soon after it has formed an adhesion with the S r r T SCTly ^ m°Ved- OT’ th0U§h this aclhesio,: that it all P 6’ " e b‘eaSt 1>aS beC0,ne 80 involved, “ a“ m°VeS as °ne solid The veins by this tin,; o m

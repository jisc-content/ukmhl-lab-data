547 than a physician. In all inflammatory diseases, a very mild diet is necessary, but even here we may run to an injurious extreme. It is now well known, that abstinence, particularly if there be an appetite, is productive of an excited or irritated state of the stomach, marked by redness of the mucous coat; and no good, I apprehend, can come from allowing any patient to feel very hungry. In all cases of excitement, particularly of inflammatory action, the diet should be mild and, generally, farinaceous. At the same time I do not consider that a little weak soup, with bread, is much more stimulating, and in the wane of the disease, it is perhaps preferable. In more chronic disorders, I maintain, that, generally speaking, that diet is best, which is found by the patient to be least troublesome afterwards, and, by his experience, to have the least injurious effect on the stomach, the pulse, the sleep, and the disease. That which is felt long in the stomach, and passes through, imper- fectly digested, is improper, and in many, though not in every case, the quantity should be more moderate than the appetite would incline to. As a proof that more importance, in chronic disease, is attached to the nature of the aliment than is necessary, provided we attend to the power of digestion, and the effect on the patient, I will, and do maintain, that if two patients, in consumption, be placed under the care of two different theorists, and the one restricted to milk and veget- ables, and the other allowed animal food, there shall, at the end of a given period, be little or no difference between them, if the function of digestion, and the state of the disease, have been the same in both. Whenever the aliment becomes acid, it proves hurtful, and therefore, in all diseases, of whatever kind, when this happens, we should avoid those articles which are, by experience, found to become readily acid, and ought also to give, along with the food, a small quantity of super- carbonate of soda, which is one of the best means of correcting this, for whilst it almost uniformly agrees well, it neutralizes the acid, and thereby removes a cause of farther injury to the function of the stomach. Dyspepsia is often attended with a peculiar susceptibility of the nerves of the stomach;

103 The essential condition of fever seems to be an excited state of that part of the nervous system which influences the action of the heart, and this part seems also to have an intimate connexion with the evolution of heat. But the two circum- stances of frequency of pulse and increased temperature, are not always proportioned to one another. The pulse may be affected by various sympathies, or by direct influence, so as to make it slower than natural, whilst the temperature is increased. The excitation of the portion of the nervous sys- tem alluded to may be counteracted by other states; and if these be of a varying nature, we may have alternately a fre- quent and a slow pulse, and this is well seen in some cases of hydrocephalus, &c. We also find, that in some cases of disease of the brain, when the pulse is gone, the patient insen- sible, and within an hour of death, the skin is still rather above than below the natural temperature, and also is be- dewed with moisture, showing the action of the capillary vessels. If I be correct in my view of fever, it will appear that it is only a criterion of the degree of excitement of the most important part of the nervous system, and that only when no sympathetic influence counteracts the manifestation, but that it never is a decided, far less infallible rule for esti- mating the degree of local inflammation. Observation leads me, I think, to a sure conclusion when I say, that the dano-er of any case cannot be estimated by the degree of fever alone, nor by the degree of local pain, but by both, connected with the general and particular injury of the various functions, and the steady tendency in the disease to increase. The fever and the local disease not being necessarily proportioned to one another, we may have even a fatal fever attended with local inflammation in no very high degree, and sometimes the reverse of this may take place. There is, however, always this connexion between the local and general disease, that if the alfected organ or part sink in its power, or change in its action, the fever also is modified â€¢ and therefore the state of the system is very different in the commencement and height of an inflammation, and when it is verging towards gangrene.

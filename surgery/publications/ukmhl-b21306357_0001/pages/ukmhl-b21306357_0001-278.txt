A small extent of mortification, with a broken bone or lacerated artery, whether suppuration have, or have not, had time to take place, in some of the neigh- bouring parts, will also form a case for operation.

So long, then, as the simple act of suppuration continues, no wound or inflamed part can ever heal, as it is an act of diseased secretion,â€”an act whereby the surface forms a new fluid, and nothing else. It has often been confounded with ulceration, or ulceration with it; but the two processes are very different, that of the latter being more complex, and involving the formation of granulations or organized matter, leading to the healing or filling up of an wound or a sore.

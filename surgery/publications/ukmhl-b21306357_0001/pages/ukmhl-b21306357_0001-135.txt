coat of the intestine, we see the preliminary appearances of inflammation very distinctly. Not only do the branches of arteries, already visible and filled with red blood, enlarge, but the numerous ramifli which shoot out from these, and were not formerly observed, become red and distinct, and that decidedly from having rapidly increased in capacity. The number of these is considerable, but not actually so great as the first inspection would lead one to believe., Presently, the interstices between these distinct ramuli appear to have a blush, and very soon ve find theie a still smaller order of vessels becoming dis- tinct, and a minute network is formed, so that now the number ol red vessels is much increased; and if the action proceed, we can find effusion of blood take place from some of these small arteries. The coats are thickened, and the substance inter- vening between the distinct vessels is quite red, partly from minute vessels, and partly from infiltration of red fibrin, and perhaps serum. The same appearances, nearly, are seen by inflaming the web of a frogâ€™s foot; and the next question is, V hat is the state of the blood in these vessels, and whether does it move faster or slower ? If we expose the web of the frogâ€™s foot to the microscope, we see branches both of arteries and veins carrying red blood, and connected with numerous smaller vessels, which are pale, and transmit globules, which in a bright light, have a brilliant appearance, and some- what a golden colour; but no red fluid or red globules are seen in them. If the web be kept moist, and the speculum be made to act so as to throw heat as well as light on it, we find that the rapidity of the circulation is increased, then red blood finds its way into the pale capillaries, and in the same proportion the velocity decreases, till at length the motion seems to cease, and the web is covered with a stationary arbo- rescence of red vessels. If we apply a solution of salt to another web, where the vessels are large, distinct, and the circulation brisk, we find that, first, the velocity is increased, then it becomes slow generally, but by no means uniformly, first in the large branches, and then in the capillaries, and generally sooner in the arteries than the veins; and last of a > it seems to cease. Before it cease in any set of vessels,

244 surface affected. There is, however, more or less suscepti- bility ol both the local and general influence at different times. A man may have putrid animal substance applied to a scratch to-day, with only the most trifling and temporary effect, but if done a month afterwards, the disease might be dangerous. I have inserted putrid animal matter under the skin of a rabbit, sometimes without producing much inflam- mation, at other times a superficial slough was speedily formed. Applied to the web of a frog, it is found to quicken the cir- culation. Experiments have been made by others to ascer- tain the effect of injecting putrid fluid into the veins, and the result has been the production of a febrile and depressed state. Having thus far explained the propagation of the low inflam- mation, and then of the gangrene along the limb, and the sympathetic effects on the constitution, even to the extinction of life, and having explicitly admitted the danger of gangren- ous inflammation in any part to the smallest extent, if the sympathy of communication have come into operation, it will naturally be asked, how any case of recovery can take place, or what resources I have left for stopping the ravages of disease: for if this spot be actually dead, and the line beyond that moribund and irrecoverable, and the portion beyond that again, although living under all the activity of inflammatory action, yet in a state so dangerous as to be pronounced almost irretrievable, and the successive limits beyond that again, pressing forward, if I may use the expression, to the same state of danger and exhaustion, it is clear that in succession the whole limb must come in successive portions to yield to the same influence and be involved in the same destruction, and that as a single spark may consume a whole building, so one spot of gangrene shall destroy the whole frame. That this â–  unfortunately is too often the case cannot be denied; but if it be not an invariable event, how does recovery take place? When speaking of inflammation I stated that it was a new action, substituted in place of the natural or healthy one, and that on the principle of the sympathy of communication, there was a tendency to extend, but with a gradually decreas- ing activity; that whilst the sympathy of communication

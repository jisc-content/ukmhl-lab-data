THE PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. CHAP. I. PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON ACTION. Life, may be defined to be the principle of preservation, for the moment it is lost, destruction begins. Respecting its nature, our knowledge is very limited and imperfect. We are taught that matter itself is inert, and yet we every where discover the operation of some active power, enabling it to continue its peculiar mode of existence. There is no such thing as dead matter. Particles may change their form and arrangement, but they still remain under the mighty spell of an invisible power, which, till it be itself annihilated by the Being who called it forth, must, without dispute, both pre- serve and control them, and render it impossible to say of the most minute atom, either that it is independent, or can cease to perform its part in the economy of the universe. There are two distinct principles in nature, the one active, the other passive. The one the agent or principle of activity, the other the material, to be acted on. We can form no idea of the existence of the latter, without the former, which may therefore be looked on as the very principle of existence, and is alike essential to the most insignificant atom, if such there be, and to the stupendous masses which roll through space.

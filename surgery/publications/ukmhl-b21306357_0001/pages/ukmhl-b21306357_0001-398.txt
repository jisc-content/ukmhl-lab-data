382 CHAP. VII. OF ADHESION. The process of adhesion is, perhaps, the most important which can come under the consideration of a surgeon. For the principles upon which it proceeds, must form in a great measure the foundation on which the success of his operations rests. When parts which have been divided, are laid together, so as to unite, we find, after the blood ceases to flow, that the vessels pour out a secretion, which has been considered as the coagulable lymph of the blood. As it cannot be de- cided, whether at first it be mere lymph, or lymph modified by the action of the vessels, it does not appear to be of prac- tical importance, to argue the question. By degrees, the intermedium, by successive absorptions and depositions, be- comes more and more analagous to the original texture, until at last no difference exists. This process of adhesion then is similar to, and of the exact nature of that of nutrition, or the constant deposition of particles, to supply those taken up by the absorbents. It is not, however, a simple process, consisting either of one step, or of a progressive series of steps, but several different actions or processes are going on at the same time. The depositing, or nutritive vessels, which formerly possessed and exercised a function, confoi tri- able to the texture to which they belonged, and necessary for its preservation or existence, reassume that action, and whilst at first every divided vessel poured out blood alone, and then a fibrinous substance, probably of the same nature, over every part of the surface, they now secrete or furnish a substance, more similar in its texture, and akin in its organi- zation, to the original state. Hence, the vasa vasorum, or depositing vessels, which formerly kept up the labile ot arteries veins, and absorbents, resuming their properties, depositâ€™in layers, what may truly be called, of microscopic extent, successive circles from the cut mouths of the minute

399 may give rise to special symptoms, and even lead to formi- dable topical disease. Very slight causes may thus occasion local inflammation ; and in the case of wounds, if great care be not taken to remove all local irritation or excitement, and promote adhesion, the part may inflame, mortify, or sup- purate extensively, or become very unhealthy, from the state of the system thus induced. The immediate effect of haemorrhage or the debility, is to be attributed to the loss of a natural stimulus, but it is one of a particular kind, not merely necessary as an agent of excitement, but it is also the very pabulum of vitality or ani- mal life, and nervous energy itself; every one part of the system suffers by the loss, but some more than others, and the very diminution of distention of the vessels is the abatement of a former excitement. In so far as mere excitation is con- cerned, we may,'within limits, find a substitute for that of the blood, but in other views there can be no supplying the place of the arterial fluid. Cordials may, within a certain extent, do good, by substituting one kind of stimulus for another, and thus preventing immediate and fatal exhaustion, but it is quite evident that if the loss be great, or the effect great, they cannot even for a short time suspend the sinking; still they constitute our chief remedy, and must be given with a free- dom and a frequency proportioned to necessity; wine and brandy ai*e the two best, and they may be given alone or mixed with warm water, according to the temperature-of the patient, and the failure of the stomach. They act first of all on the stomach, and through its nerves on the whole nervous sys- tem. rI heir effect, however, is fugacious, and that in propor- tion to the effect of the haemorrhage; and, therefore, they must be frequently repeated and persevered in, till the system have rallied and so far accommodated itself to the loss of blood, as to allow us to dispense with them. This we judge of by the pulse being more steady, the stomach more comfortable, the heat more natural. Opium is also a valuable cordial, for it really stimulates the system, and not only does so, but seems to promote the restoration of animal heat, and lessen the uncomfortable feelings produced by the unnatural state of

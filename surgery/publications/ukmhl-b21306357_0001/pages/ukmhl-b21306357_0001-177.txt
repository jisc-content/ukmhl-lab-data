lGl change of structure and inflammation are mutually connected together or identified ; that in other cases, where this does not obtain, and some new organization and mode of acting, neither inflammatory nor yet proper to the part exists, it more fre- quently has no effect whatever, especially in long continued disease; and that in numerous instances it has, when freely given, accelerated the death of the patient, either by producing languor and great debility, or actually exciting inflammation or suppuration; and considering the indiscriminate way in which it is given, I have great doubt, setting syphilis out of the ques- tion, whether more patients should not recover, or at least live longer, were a course of mercury prohibited by law. It is peculiarly noxious in scrofulous habits, and much more frequently hurries scrofulous tumours, wherever they are placed, whether m the liver, lungs, or external glands, on to suppuration than to absorption. Of muriate of lime and iodine, I can only admit, that in moderate doses, they are ' safer than mercury; but I am not warranted to say that they are more useful. The truth is, that when inflammation has entirely gone off, little confidence can be placed in any of t iese remedies. They may be employed so far, and only so Jong, as they do not exasperate the disease, an effect seldom produced by any of these but mercury, or weaken the patient. It will be said, that the disease is left to its own course, if we do not vigorously attack it by these remedies. My reply is, prove that these so frequently do good, and so seldom do harm, as to justify the practice; or to put the matter in another light, I join issue on the question, whether, if an induration or change of texture resist the early use of leeches, and the other primary means already spoken of, during the only period when they can do good, we have not a better chance of the patient living longer, and enjoying ns ealth, by what may be called a negative practice, than by the use of active means, which, if they fail to remove the t isease, as they usually do, must produce an effect decidedly injurious both on the system and the organ. Where we have no specific remedy for the removal of a tumour, as for instance, mercury in syphilis, we should never, in one of a

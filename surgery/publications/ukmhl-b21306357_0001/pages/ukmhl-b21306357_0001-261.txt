245 became the cause to a certain degree of the extension of disease, it was our only resource for the restoration of health, for the parts yet in a state of proper or comparatively natural action, would in their turn react on the diseased part v hen its activity had begun to flagâ€ž and restore it, if the oiganization were not irretrievably injured, gradually to a state of health. In the same way, in the present case, if the local disease and the sympathy it excites do not overpower the system, the reflux, if I may so speak, of the natural or healthy action of the system, will meet and give a check to the propa- gation ol the disease; and we may therefore, were it allowable to introduce fanciful imagery, say, that we had two contend- ing powers, warring in contrary directions, and as one or other gained the superiority so would the fate of the day be. That there is a power of resistance in the system, explain it in what way we choose, is evident from the consideration that were there none the disorder must inevitably spread, and in every instance overpower the constitution. On the other hand, were the means of resistance always adequate, disease should never advance beyond, or far beyond its original seat. There is then a contest as it were between health and disease, the dis- ordered action tending to establish itself in place of the healthy, or what may be called the natural action; and as one or other shall prevail so is the result, the victory or defeat of the constitution or system at large depending much on the intensity ol the cause, its obstinacy, and the power of resistance which can be offered. Gangrenous inflammation spreads, the pai t is predisposed to its reception by weakness, and the shades become indistinct, as we mark the state downward i om the trunk to the mortification. First, we find a condition o gieat debility, but not of simple weakness; for as the part w Inch has caused all the evil is not in a state of mere debility ut of gangrenous inflammation sinking towards death, so c oes it by sympathy modify the whole frame more or less, and pioi uce an universal state ol proneness toward a similar con- t ition. Then, we find as we approach nearer the focus of c lsease, an incipient, and next a confirmed low inflammation eepening into the moribund state, and thence into sphacelus;

Let all these be taken into consideration, and the case will appear sufficiently unpromising; yet even in these circum- stances, it is astonishing how soon, by counter-openings, ban- dages, poulticing the glands, and opening them when required, promoting digestion, and supporting the strength, the patient gets well, and that without any perceptible exfoliation. In other cases, doubtless, whether from negligence, or the still greater severity of the disease, or the influence of a scrofulous habit, the patient sinks under hectic, and the bones at death are found unusually rough, in many places appearing like worm-eaten wood, and perhaps here and there destroyed down to the dura mater. It remains still shortly to notice the speciality connected with exanthematous inflammation, or erysipelas, which may take place either without any obvious local exciting cause, or in consequence of external injury or irritation. Till we know more of the sympathetic effect of the alimentary organs on the skin, we cannot explain why in one case the head, and in another the foot, should be affected; but whether we adopt the notion of direct but inexplicable sympathies between one part and another, or proceed on the principle that it is through the medium of the state induced at the origin of the nerves we know it to be a fact, that one part of the canal may sym- pathise more with certain districts of the surface than the rest or perhaps even different action of the same part may influ- ence different districts. We know that one kind of irritation or disorder of one part of the canal, produces pain in or over t ie right eye; in other cases it is the left which is affected sometimes the back of the head, sometimes the front or the Vely top’ ol' tl,e jaws- If "'<■ soy that the origin of the nerves diiW8 thr T? ^ irritated> we mereIy “"ounce that paits of the sensorium commune may at different

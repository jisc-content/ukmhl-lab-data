424 false aneurism, they enlarge in proportion to the obstruction in the trunk. In the latter case, an operation delayed may be more directly successful in proportion to the obstruction in the trunk, and we have no cause, in operation, tending to contract the anastomosing branches. In the former, the con- tinuation of the trunk and the collateral branches have been regularly diminishing, and an operation, finds them in a state worse than that met with at the moment of the accident; a second effect is, that the blood, impinging against the side of the vein opposite to the arterial aperture, dilates it, and pro- duces a tumour to a certain extent, but the more that the vein enlarges, the more is the force diffused, and the less is its effect, until we come to the degree when it ceases to ope- rate or excite dilatation, which is sooner attained, perhaps, by an additional strength being imparted to the venous coat, and this ultimatum being reached, no farther augmentation takes place. But the blood flowing with force from the artery, impedes the passage of that which was proceeding from the extremities of the veins, and all the veins of the limb, from their connexion with one another, become en- larged, and the effects of a ligature are for a time produced. This, in the arm, is of less consequence, but when the jugu- lar vein is affected, very serious or fatal disease should be pro- duced, were blood not immediately abstracted. We have'just seen that in an aneurismal varix the blood passes partly along the continuation of the artery, and partly into the vein, and this prepares us for a state we find in slits, punctures, and oblique wounds of arteries. W e have seen that in quadrupeds, such wounds, if not beyond a certain extent, may unite, and the tube remain pervious. But it will be very difficult, I do not say impossible, to bring forward such cures in the human subject. False aneurism, is almost unavoidably produced, and there is, perhaps, even a smaller chance of a natural cure being effected, than in a case of complete division. The temporary cessation of discharge into the sac, or of haemorrhage, where there is an unhealed wound, is not necessarily produced by a coagulum within the vessel, but by a clot filling and covering exteriorly the slit in

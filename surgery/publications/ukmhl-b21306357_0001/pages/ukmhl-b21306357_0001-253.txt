If the parts become livid, either a yeast poultice, or cloths soaked in port wine may be used, according as the one or other shall prove comfortable. When all ol these fail to give relief, when the pain is of a burning and intolerable kind, strong camphorated spirit of wine is the best application. Under these circumstances also, suitable doses of opium must be administered, in order to relieve the pain, as nothing has a stronger tendency to increase the mis- chief than this high sensation. The farther treatment both of the constitution and of the part in more extreme cases of this inflammatio debilis, will be better introduced when treat- ing of mortification, which I am next to proceed to consider. CHAP. III. OF MORTIFICATION. Mortification, as the term implies, is the death of the part in whatever way that is produced; but it has been customary to divide it, absurdly enough, into two stages. The first is called gangrene, the second 'is sphacelus. The first derived from the Greek verb, signifying to feed upon; the second lrom that signifying to destroy. These appellations, how- ever, are a little fanciful. For practical writers explain the one merely as the beginning, and the other as the consumma- tl0n ° 1 6 eviL Hlldanus says, «gangrena est principium mortifications, sphacelus plena perfecta et absoluta.” So lono- as t e part possesses any degree of sensibility, heat or symptom of vuallty, it is said to be only gangrenous.

380 tion for an obliteration of the cyst. This is, to say the best of it, a very uncertain, and generally a very tedious prac- tice. If the orifice heal speedily, the cyst renews its secretion, and we presently are just where we were. On the other hand, if it do not heal, the secretion goes on, and although it may be altered in quality, and the cyst contracted in size, we have a long continued discharge, a thickening of the parts, and at the very best a sinus leading into these parts. I know well, that sometimes by steady pressure, sometimes by the injection of stimulating fluids, or the passage of a seton along the sinus, or the introduction of a tent smeared with an escha- rotic, a cure has ultimately been accomplished; but I also know, that very formidable effects have occasionally resulted from the use of these means, and although a patient have been cured after high constitutional irritation, and formidable ery- sipelas, yet life itself is brought into danger. In order to accelerate the cure, it has been proposed at once to pass a seton through an encysted tumour, and this, no doubt by its continued presence, might ultimately so far alter the action of the secreting surface, as at last to establish a species of sup- puration, so that, when afterwards withdrawn, the part heals; yet even where the most favourable change of secretion takes place, a cure cannot be relied on, and in many instances fatal effects rapidly are produced. Within a few hours after the introduction of the seton, the patient may be seized with shivering, sometimes amounting even to convulsive shaking; this is followed by heat, and sometimes by perspiration, and the pulse in all the stages is excessively frequent. 1 he tumour or the parts around it at the same time swell, or become more or less painful, and the skin sometimes erysipelatous. If these symptoms do not abate within three days, they generally prove fatal; they may do so even more rapidly. In the disserta- tions on inflammation which 1 published nearly thirty years ago, I noticed a curious case, where, soon after the insertion of a seton, the tumour began to secrete air, at the same time that extreme irritation ot the system was produced, and a similar tendency to secrete a gaseous fluid prevailed ovei the body, so that a general emphysema took place: the case

The part, if the abscess be small, may then be dressed with simple ointment: if arger, a compress and roller lightly applied should be used after t ie matter has been gently pressed out. Bad consequences seldom follow the opening of abscesses which have been pre- cecec even by slight inflammation, although chronic, and t" "^eie they are consequent to acute inflamma- ion. here are, however, collections of matter, which form 1 mut any appeaiance of previous inflammation, so that iey may e considered rather as constituting a species of encystec tumour, than as deserving the appellation usually bestowed upon them of chronic abscesses!* These cysts or f" “ ,°nS mC1'eaSe Sl°Wly’ a,’d often’ Particularly below a tascia, to an immense extent.

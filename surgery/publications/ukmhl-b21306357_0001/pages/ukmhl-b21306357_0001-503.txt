487 be trusted to nature, for it follows the course of aneurism; but it is very doubtful bow far the proposal of tying the artery above the tumour, can be trusted ; for, as there is a retrograde circulation, and an opening into the vein from the circumscribed sac, it is very uncertain if coagulation and obli- teration could take place. It is better to open the sac, and tie the artery. It has been supposed that there might be a double aneu- rismal varix, or that the state just described was really such, the superficial vein being first wounded, then one of the deep veins, and lastly the artery. The sac supposed to be formed under the fascia would, on this principle, really consist ol a dilated deep vein. But the whole of this rests for the present on mere speculation. Lastly, I must remark, that both the main artery of a limb, and its corresponding vein, may be wounded in such a way as that no connexion can take place between them, nor can we procure safely a union of the integuments over them. We have, in an open wound, two distinct and separate injuries, that of the artery, and that of the vein. The practice is to tie, if possible, both ends of the artery at the wounded part, and then, after bringing the surfaces of the external wound together, apply such moderate pressure as shall restrain the haemorrhage from the vein, without obliterating it, or injuring the circulation in the limb. It is also possible to cure this state by tying the artery higher than the wound, and then, by moderate pressure on the wound, to restrain the venous haemorrhage, and that from the retrograde arterial circula- tion ; in which case, we may have either a complete cure, or an aneurismal varix produced. To tie both the artery and the vein, I believe, should be certainly fatal, and in the present state of our knowledge, I would rather advise imme- diate amputation of the extremity. I

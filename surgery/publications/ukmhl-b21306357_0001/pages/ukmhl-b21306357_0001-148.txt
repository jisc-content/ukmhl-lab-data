132 therefore, even with the view of acting on it, must be content to act through the medium of the vascular system at large. Two powerful means of arresting inflammation, are general and topical bloodletting; and although there be cases where the latter is the most useful, yet, in a vast proportion, the former is most to be depended on, and the latter chiefly to be employed as a subsidiary measure. Before considering the modus operandi of loss of blood, or the circumstances which ought to regulate the extent of deple- tion, I will premise two remarks. First, That in the cure of most diseases it is nature that effects the restoration, and remedies only remove obstacles. It is by lessening or weak- ening the morbid action that we allow the healthy action to return, and this is often done by the sympathy of communi- cation, already explained, effecting a reflux, if I may use the expression, of natural action from the sound, or more slightly affected part of the body, to the diseased part, and re-estab- lishing a more healthy action in it. Merely diminishing action or excitement, which is all that some think necessary for the cure of inflammation, can only lessen, but not change the action, and therefore I repeat it, that our remedies only cure indirectly, by permitting and enabling nature to act; and even at the hazard of being taxed with repetition, I once more earnestly call on the student to reflect on the importance of early interference, and decided means, before the disease have taken too firm root, to be removed. It is evident, how- ever, that if, in our attempts to moderate or lessen the degree or intensity of the morbid action, we shall go so far as to sub- due the vigour of the system in general, and produce much debility, it will be nearly as impossible for this restoration to be effected, as for a person, enfeebled and exhausted by pro- longed efforts to prevent himself from drowning, to mount at last the cliff he has struggled to reach. Could we lessen the action of the inflamed part, and at a certain stage increase the vigour and natural action of the system, we should save many who are lost for want of this power. It necessarily follows from this remark, that whatever treatment we follow, must be preceded by the removal, as fin- as possible, of the

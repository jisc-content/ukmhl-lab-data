l.OG stitution of the patient, on the natural texture and function of the affected part, on the extent of the original derangement, and on the peculiar structure of the newly formed induration, not a little in those circumstances which check or encourage activity in the tumour. Some remain for a long course of years quiescent, others early become active, and end in ulceration. Some are principally hurtful by their mechanical irritation, others dangerous from the malignancy of their action. Some are chiefly to be dreaded from tbeir interfer- ence with the necessary function of the part where they are situated, others soon cause hectic fever, or wear out the system by pain and irritation, or seem to exhaust the constitution, without either fever or acute suffering. Look to all the formidable and often irrecoverable diseases which present themselves to the surgeon, to the various classes of tumours and indurations wherever situated, and however they may operate, whether seated in the stomach, or encircling the rectum, or occasioning stricture in the urethra, or thickening of the bladder, or swelling of the testicle, or ovarium, or internal glands, or in the brain, or the lungs, or the abdominal viscera, or joints, or any part of the whole cellular expansion, one common cause for all the varied evil may be traced, and will be found to have consisted in inflammation. We have only to look at this catalogue of evils, constituting the greatest number of human maladies, and then, without considering the acute effects of inflammation, we may well say, that if this process be the result of the wisdom of nature, the conse- quences of her folly must be still more marvellous and disas- trous, and may declare, as Van Helmont did on another occa- sion, that in this case the Archeus operateth imprudently. Tumours, whether resulting from acute and well marked, or from more obscure degrees of inflammation, may either continue in a state of action, approximating to inflammation, or may remain long dormant, by which I mean, without any tendency to excitement, or increase either of action or of d-rowth/ Organization and action are so connected, that an alteration of the one must affect the other; and as in the simplest tumour, wTe perceive if there be any action beyond

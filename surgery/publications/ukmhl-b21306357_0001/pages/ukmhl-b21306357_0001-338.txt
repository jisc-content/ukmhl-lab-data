322 the same principle of acting on the vessels, it has been pro- posed to tie the arterial trunk supplying the part, for example, when the disease occupied the orbit and eyelids, to tie the carotid artery; but as yet we have too few instances of success to authorize us in forming a decided opinion. When we consider the free anastomosis which exists between the vessels of both sides of the face, and with some of the branches of the internal carotid, we should not be very sanguine in our expectation of a cure by tying one great vessel. Still, there are cases where the trial must be made, or the patient must be left to die; as, for instance, when the tumour is seated extensively in the fauces, velum, and roof of the mouth. The most effectual plan, when it can be accomplished, is to dissect the tumour completely away. If we cut into any part of the texture, we are sure to have an ungovernable haemorrhage from a multitude of points, but if we cut completely beyond it, we have only the individual arteries, which supply the tumour, to attend to. It is clear, from the description given of the tumour, that unless when it is under a fascia, wTe can save no part of the integuments which cover it, and therefore must leave the wound to heal by granulation, unless in those cases where we can, without producing greater deformity, draw the lax skin together so as to produce a cure by adhesion. When many vessels feed the tumour and cannot easily be controlled, it might, in delicate patients, particularly in chil- dren, be dangerous' to attempt the extirpation by dissection ; and tying individual branches previous to the removal of the tumour, can have little influence on the general loss of blood to be sustained, and still less can the ligature of these vessels be trusted to as a mean of obliteration. In such cases, thrust- ing two long needles at right angles to one another, across the substratum of the tumour in sound substance, and then twisting a ligature tightly round the base, beyond these needles, may destroy it. But if such a tumour be situated on the cheek, it must be considered whether the needles must not be carried so deep as to leave little more than the membrane of the mouth beyond them, which in that case must inevitably slough, and leave a large opening. When deformity is not

251 topical bleeding might lessen the inflammation in a part not yet sinking. Assuredly there are such cases though rare; and the lancet even in those cases which I have alluded to, is to be used with caution, and always with attention to its effects on the pulse and strength; and I strongly protest against tesot ting to the use of this remedy in a case altogether t ii eient. When gangtene has taken place from constitu- tional causes, from erysipelas, in fact from any cause or under any circumstance besides that to which I have alluded, I hold t te ancet to be inadmissable. The question is not, whether at any stage bleeding might not have been proper, or whether m a particular instance brought before us, the early detrac- tion of blood might not have checked the inflammation or pre- vented it from ending in gangrene. Were this the point at issue, I should say, that in all doubtful cases it is safer to lean to the side of the lancet.

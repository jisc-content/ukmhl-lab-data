24 plications being in so far indescribable, that there are scarcely two specimens of the same disease exactly alike. We can do little more than confine our description to general and essential characters, for it would be as impossible to give an account of the varieties, as it would be to describe the arrangement of the motes which dance in the sunbeam ; and yet, on attention to these varieties, to the peculiarity of constitution, and the existing sympathies must depend, the rational treatment, perhaps, the preservation of the patient. CHAP. II. OF INFLAMMATION. SECTION FIRST. Whenever the natural preservative action of a part is increased or urged beyond a certain degree, it becomes alto- gether changed in its nature and phenomena, and the result is soon a new state called inflammation. This apparently bears no resemblance to the natural or healthy action, and yet, when analyzed, it is found to be made up of the different parts of the natural and proper action of the part, as certainly as the deep or almost black colour of one portion of a fluid, may be proved to depend merely on the concentration of those colouring particles, which in another portion, have produced the most delicate azure tint. Nosologists have considered the existence of inflammation to be marked by redness, heat, and pulsating pain of the part, and to these symptoms some add tumour. It would be by no means difficult to show, that these phenomena do not necessarily indicate the presence of actual inflammation, for they may exist without it, and on the other hand, it may be present without the whole of them. There are certain affections of the nerves of sensation, accom- panied both with heat and throbbing, and which yet are not inflammatory. If we redden such a part by friction, and

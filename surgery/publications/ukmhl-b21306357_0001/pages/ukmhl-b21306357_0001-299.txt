283 extends under the fascia, and spreads rapidly. It must be let out instantly, a compress lightly applied, and the strength supported. Another form of this is less apt to end in exten- sive suppuration. It begins, very soon after the puncture, with a febrile attack, headach and nausea, followed by most acute pain in the armpit, region of the clavicle or pectoral muscle and shoulder. The parts are extremely tender to the touch, swelled, generally tense, but sometimes doughy and the swelling usually pits on pressure. Erysipelatous redness is extended down the thorax, whilst the whole extremity swells more or less, and the punctured part vesicates. The swelling here is uniform, and no matter is evacuated by incision, for the fluid is interstitial, as we see in those swellings I have described as following puncture and irritation by other causes. Purulent matter may at last form in different parts, but the patient seldom lives long enough for that. Bleeding and other remedies have generally failed; and when recovery has taken place, it seems to have been more owing to nature than to art. Still we must endeavour to palliate symptoms, for instance by applying leeches instantly to the swollen part, and then either cold water, or tepid fomentations as the patient feels most useful. Gentle purges and saline julap may be given as slight assistants, and if any indication justify us, we may cut for matter and apply a poultice. We give nourish- ment and quinine. CHAP. V. OF ULCERATION. In common language, ulcer and sore, the former of Greek the latter of Saxon derivation, are used as synonimes. The term ulcer is to be traced to the Greek verb, signifying to diaw, because it was imagined that the humours were drawn or attracted to the ulcerated part.

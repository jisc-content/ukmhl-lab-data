Second, That we watch the effect; and if we find it to produce injurious excitement of the system, or of the organ, it must instantly be abandoned, and in no case is it to be pushed to a debilitating extent. I have been the more particular in my notice of the benefit to be expected from mercury, because I shall immediately speak of its useless and injurious exhibition. The different remedies I have now enumerated must be employed with a promptitude, vigour, and to an extent pro- portioned, not merelj' to the degree of inflammation mea- sured absolutely, but also considered l’elatively to the strength of the system, or ol the inflamed part, or the sensibility and habitudes ot that part, and its importance to life. But I should ill discharge my duty, did I stop here, and having described the disease and its treatment, I return to a position I have been obliged reluctantly to set out with, that often, under the most vigorous treatment, the disease, con- sisting as much in a new organization as a new action, obsti- nately resists all our remedies. Now, this very fact which at first appears so discouraging, I mean to lay hold of as a power- ful argument in favour of energetic practice. I am bound to ask of myself, and entitled to inquire of others, why one man dies, whilst another recovers. It is very easy to give some general answer to this momentous question, which may appear to exonerate both the practice and the practitioner; and we may talk learnedly of constitutions and irritabilities, and adventitious combinations, and after all, leave the matter as we found it, and our own principles no better than before. But if we look more strictly to the case, we must come to the alternative, either that in this fatal case there has been a mis- management, a procrastination in the use of some of the means, or there has been some state of the part or system, which rendered the use of these fruitless, such an enfeebled constitution, perhaps, as rendered it impossible for it to stand both the attack of the disorder and the remedy. But with tbe fact before us, we surely neglect our duty if we allow inflammation to exist a single hour, without the use of appro-

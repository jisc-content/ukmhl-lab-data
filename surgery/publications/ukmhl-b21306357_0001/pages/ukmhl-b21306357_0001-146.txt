130 new, and which as yet we have no means of directly destroy- ing. Indirectly, we may do some good by means which lessen action in general, and which obviate particular effects or manifestations; but beyond this, the present state of science, I regret to say, does not carry us. The second remark is almost a corollary from the first, namely, that no inflammation can, by any means whatever, be immediately cured; and some, as expe- rience unfortunately testifies, resist the early and judicious use of every means. I have already noticed a preliminary state leading to, but not constituting inflammation, which may last longer or shorter in different instances, and which often may speedily be checked by proper remedies. But if the action be once established, I can, whilst I admit that early and vigorous means may cuiâ€™e it, see no more reason, from the consideration of the case on its own ground, why the means should succeed, than why they should fail; and start- ling as the acknowledgment may be to those who place more reliance on a name than on the thing itself, or on a doctrine than on experience, I must say, that considering how little we know, the wonder is not that any patient dies, but that so many recover. It were to little purpose to express this opi- nion, if it did not lead others to inquire more carefully into the minute nature of different diseased actions, and particu- larly of inflammation, for the purpose of acquiring a better knowledge of the method of cure; and I only add, that till that be obtained, no man is exonerated from the prompt and diligent use of such means as he possesses. It is a question, of somewhat more than mere curiosity, to determine why, under the same treatment, and by the appli- cation of the same rules and principles, one man shall die, and another recover; and why one man shall be cured in twenty- four hours, and another not for as many days. If inflamma- tion be a mere increase of action, and depletion a certain mean of diminishing action, we shall be brought back to the old question of the panegyrist of sage, Cur monatur homo, cui salvia crescit in hortu f Surely, in both cases, the fault must either be in the doctor or the remedy. We may, by a gal- vanic battery, decompose and new arrange the most obdurate

117 i SECTION NINTH. Ihe proximate cause of inflammation is still involved in much obscurity. We have seen, from the short enumeration of exciting causes, that this disease may be produced even by the subduction of a stimulus, that of heat, for instance, if another, that of sensation, were at the same time in operation. From attentive consideration of facts, it seems evident, that what- ever can produce a certain disproportion between action and power, or even greatly derange action, may induce inflam- mation. This is neither a simple, nor perhaps an uniform process, for one part of action may, in particular cases, be moie affected than the rest, so as to cause a modification ; but in many instances a new texture is formed, and a new consti- tution or action given to the organ, and no increase or varia- tion of any part, or of every part of its action, can constitute inflammation without this change. An inflamed part is a new organ, which, therefore, in one sense, may be called a parasite. As a comet in the solar system can neither be considered as a portion subjected to the strict and well cal- culated rules of that system, nor altogether absolved from them, and incapable of acting, or being acted on by the less enatic oibs, so the inflamed part, though, to a certain extent, regulated by its own laws, and acting as a distinct organ, has a mighty power on the system on the one hand, whilst on the other, it is strongly influenced by it. This inflamed part, if acutely and severely affected, and particularly if, from its original Connexions and importance, it be much influenced by the new and diseased state of the system, to which it may itself have given rise, seldom lives long, unless the inflam- matory action be subdued. But in other circumstances, it may not die quickly or mortify, neither may it indirectly become destroyed by suppuration, nor return to a state of health ; but the inflammatory action may continue as a state now natural to the part itself. I am sure I do some'service to the student by impressing this fact on his mind, and endea- 'oming to satisfy him, that inflammation is not uniformly t tat acute process which he at first believes it to be, but that

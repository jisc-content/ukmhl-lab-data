I can afford no other explanation of the effect of suppuration, in exciting hectic fever or constitutional disorder; but I would attempt farther to account for the peculiar ten- dency to perspiration, often to oedema or dropsy, and the very marked emaciation which attends the complaint, even although t e appetite be not lost, by saying, that the general formative action of the system is deranged or impaired by sympathy with the local one, in which the action is totally changed. I would also observe, that this universal disorder seems to be communicated and kept up by the influence of the nervous system which is acted on by the state of the nerves of the affected part; and from this influence being exerted some- nmes more on one part than another of the medulla spinalis, Z fury oeZ7 y, ent effeCtS produ“d- Sometimes the y of he disorder is spent on the bowels, and inveterate diarrhoea takes place.

241 parts, but it never existed in the sphacelated portion. A part, therefore, it is evident, may mortify in different ways : it may PeiJSh horn want of nourishment, or it may be destroyed by o\eiaction. Ihe lower that the power of a part is, the less able is it to bear up under action, and the more numerous that the excitements are, the sooner must any part be destroyed. The consideration, then, of mortification is not so simple as might at first be supposed; for it involves an attention to many different points. We must attend to the healthy and natural condition of the part; to its previous state before the accession of disease; to the influence which the constitution lias over it; to the relative degree of inflammation compared to tie power of the part; to the complication of that inflam- mation with more or less sensation, with more or less impedi- ment to the circulation, with its connexion with textures more or less delicate, and its modification by those inexplica- cone itions, which for want of better language we call specific. When we examine into the state of a part on the rrlT°n’m COnse(luence of previous inflammation, / . exhlbltlng the appearances of a part inflamed, and a part dying. The previous symptoms of inflammation still in Pat t exist, there is still swelling, still an increased quantity of fluid, still numerous blood-vessels, still much pain; but t iere is more venous congestion, consequently more livklity • there is less secretion of heat ; the cuticle is more ejy separate ; isters filled with bloody serum appear; the part s dying but the appearances are not those of a part dyino- fiom debility, of apart dying without disorganization;' but they are those of an inflamed part dying; of a part dyino undei the existence of organic disease.

Mortifi cation then, following upon inflammation, is the death of an ■"flamed part, and if we could suppose s/nocha 6r Mall-

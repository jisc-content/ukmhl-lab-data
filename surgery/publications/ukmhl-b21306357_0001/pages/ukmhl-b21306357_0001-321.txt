305 stances, that of an insensible slough, or of an irritable and some- times exquisitely tender surface, it may be supposed that both plans may be alternately useful. Stimulants, I believe, can do little good through a slough, and they are seldom found to answer well in the inflammatory stage. We are therefore led to adopt the actual cautery or the mild dressings. The application, I believe, the most generally useful is a carrot or bread and milk poultice, with which charcoal may be some- times mixed, in order to diminish the smell. If stimulants are to be tried, the best, I believe, is a solution of nitrate of silver, or ot chloride of lime. I am more disposed, however, to attribute the cure oftener to the efforts of nature, than to the active influence of the remedies employed. When there is high action, bloodletting may be necessary to subdue it: more frequently we must endeavour to support the strength without giving undue excitement, obviate such causes as still tend to injure the constitution, and employ such dressings as may alone, or with opiates, best allay pain. We have no specific, no peremptory mean of cure; our only rational hope can be placed on that plan, which professes to put the system in the situation best calculated for overcoming the disease. CHAP. VI. OF TUMOURS. SECTION FIRST. If we could suppose that tumours were ever formed to any considerable extent, by mere augmentation of natural texture to a preternatural degree, we would divide them into two great classesâ€”the natural and the adventitious. We often read of cellular and fatty tumours, and no doubt, in certain parts of the body, accumulations of fat may take place. Put almost without exception, every tumour differs in some respects from any natural texture; and even those which \ X

413 an obliteration did not take place, we should, granting the sac to be made quite solid by coagulation, and afterwards diminished by absorption of the contents, still be insecure, for the blood would flow to the very confines of the diseased part, and there would be danger of an enlargement there. If in true aneurism we might, after this partial cure, have a renewal of the disease, we are still worse off in the false aneu- rism ; for even were the blood to be altogether coagulated in the sac, and for a little way within the arterial tube, still there is not the same distinct resistance afforded to the vis a tergo, the same firm support given to the coagulum in the artery, the same continued or prolonged cessation of all motion of the blood, and, therefore, obliteration cannot happen; and, on the other hand, we have, as already noticed, disease induced in all the parts connected with the bloody cavity, and in some instances, ultimately a mixture of aneurism and of suppuration, ending perhaps in gangrenous inflammation of the vicinity. Tenth, When the blood is prevented from passing along the main trunk, either by a ligature, a complete division, or any other cause, the anastomosing or collateral branches come, in consequence of this obstruction, to enlarge, and, presently, the lower part of the limb is fully supplied with blood. This circuitous renewal of circulation may, howevei', not take place so soon, or so effectually, as to prevent the limb from suffering, perhaps, from dying, especially if it have been previously diseased or weak in its nervous power; on the other hand, the enlargement of the collateral branches, imply- ing action in an increased degree, that may be more than the power of the limb can bear, and mortification takes place. But the parts die, not, as in the former case, by failure or direct sinking, dependant on mere want of nourishment, but from an excitement higher than the part can bear, or a degree of inflammation. In all cases where the circulation is to be carried on by the enlargement of anastomosing branches, the temperature rises, soon after the trunk is obstructed or divided; but, in favourable cases, the elevation is gradual and moderate, and not attended with pain, or redness, or lividity of the extreme parts of the limb. WThen an artery, then, is

543 that whether we have local or general disorder induced by any cause, that disorder must be influenced by the previous state of important organs, or by such conditions as may sub- sequently be induced in them. There can be as little doubt that such states of particular organs and functions, must have an influence on the system at all times, and previous to any injury or local disease ; but the consequences of this influence may not be manifest in the ordinary state of health. But no sooner does a fever take place, or a tumour appear, or a local injury be inflicted, than we find a most marked influence xcited; and, if we endeavour not, to correct the state of the organ or function thus in fault, we cannot cure our patient. It will also be evident, from what has in a former part of this work been stated, that disorder in one part, for instance in the abdominal viscera, may affect a distant part, and produce there an improper mode of acting, manifested by inflamma- tion, or some other disease, and only to be removed by removing the original cause. The means of improvement, must vary according to the organ affected, and the state of the function; but the principle to be remembered is, that if such derangements can produce distant disorder, or keep up general excitation, their removal must, if not effectual, be at least indispensable. We regulate the diet, giving only what is most easily digested; we promote digestion by antidys- peptic medicines; we restore and keep up the action of the intestines by laxatives; we use sarsaparilla, and other similar medicines, called, for want of a better term, alteratives; and we abstain from the use of stimulants, which, whilst they could do no good to the system, might excite farther the disorder of the organ in fault. . 4 here doubtless may be local diseases, apparently arising without evident exciting cause, and which are occasioned by distant organs acting sympathetically. Although it by no means follows that the removal of the disorder of such organs, even aided by topical applications, and other suitable means, shall remove the local disease, yet we are pretty sure, that so long as the remote cause exists, the disease, more immediately an object of attention, cannot be cured. Therefore, along with

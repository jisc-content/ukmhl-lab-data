most dangerous ; for, setting aside the evils arising from exten- sive suppuration, and great constitutional disorder, the very inflammation, which preceded the suppuration, could not be limited in its influence to the part itself, but must have power- fully affected the limb below, which was in a state ill calcu- lated to bear disease of any kind, and especially such as were attended with much excitement. Hence many were cut off by gangrene, instead of being destroyed by hectic fever, or constitutional excitement. But farther, even if those evils did not take place, the patient was in great danger of being killed by a sudden haemorrhage; for the artery was tied in an unsound part, and no dependance could be placed on adhe- sion, nay, on the contrary, it must have happened that he who unwittingly tied the artery farthest from the disease, or made, what must then have been considered, the most uncalled for dissection, should have succeeded best, whilst he who exposed no more than was barely necessary to secure the orifices, must have uniformly failed. All these evils led Mr. Pott, who was inferior to no surgeon of his time in this or any other country, decidedly to say, that amputation was preferable to the opera- tion for aneurism ; and when amputation could not be per- formed, we well know that surgeons at that time were not prepared to tie an artery. Mr. Hunter, who was among the first who seems to have thought it necessary to apply the principles of philosophy and science to his profession, and who indeed may be considered as the parent of modern sur- gery, explained one chief cause of failure, namely, the state of the artery as it enters the aneurism. I_Ie was a man of strong good sense, of an inquiring, and even speculative mind, united to great industry, and enthusiasm in his profession. Plis defi- ciency in many points of reasoning, his eccentricities and substitution of final for efficient causes, as well as his igno- rance of the literature, as it may be called, of his profession, and the consequences resulting therefrom, afford strong argu- ments in favour of a liberal education. But his lot was so cast, that with little preliminary education, he could, by his own powers, make a progress beyond other men: and, although he can be no example for those who have less talent, and not

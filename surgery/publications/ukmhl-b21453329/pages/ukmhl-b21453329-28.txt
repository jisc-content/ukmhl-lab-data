26 be taken of the double action of the levator palati, to get some of the air thus compressed, forced into the Eustachian tube, which might be of service in clearing away any temporary obstacle which was a cause of Eustachian deafness. Just at this time a young lady, in a family upon whom I was making a professional visit, asked me if I could do anything for deafness. I said I did not profess to practise aural surgery; but requested her, after I left, to swallow some water two or three times while she held her nostrils compressed between her finger and thumb. Judge of my surprise when I called next morning, to be told that after swallowing the third time, she experienced a sensation of crackling in her ear, and the deafness instantaneously disappeared and did not return. I recounted and explained the circum- cumstance to my students that day, and every year since, when demonstrating the structure of the palate, I have mentioned it in connection with the physiology of swallowing. In 1862, Politzer of Vienna published his newmethodof restoring Eustachian deafness, by the very means I have described, with the addition of the introduction of a stream of condensed air, admitted to the pharynx by a tube passed through one of the com- pressed nostrils. Politzerization, as it is now called, is one of the regular proceedings of aurists, and is an almost certain way of removing deafness caused by Eustachian obstruction. It is strange how long a time sometimes inter-

ADD R E S S. When a Professor in this University delivers liis inaugural address, it is customary for him to refer to the labours of his predecessors, to name some of the illustrious men who have occupied his place and added to the renown of the Medical School of Glasgow; to review the progress of the branch of science which he is called on to teach, during previous incumbencies, and in view of the responsibilities which now devolve upon him, to bespeak the good wishes of those who are to be his future hearers. By the practice and ex- perience of former professors, his path is to a great extent clearly defined, his duties are well understood, and his object is, profiting by what has gone before^ to emulate and, if possible, improve upon the success of his predecessors. But I am in a different position. I am called upon to occupy for the first time a chair which has been founded by the University to meet a deficiency in the completeness of the staff of its medical professors.

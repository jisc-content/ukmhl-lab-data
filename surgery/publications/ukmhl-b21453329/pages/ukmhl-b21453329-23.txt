In April, 1864, I performed the operation on a patient in the Infirmary, and I had the pleasure of placing on record the first successful case of Ovariotomy in Glasgow or the West of Scot- land. Since then it has been yearly performed with an amount of success equal to that of any capital operation. Cancer of the tongue is one of the most distressing of surgical afiections. The gnawing pain prevents sleep, and exhausts the sufferer, who is in great part deprived of the power of speech and swallowing. When only a small part is affected, it is easy to remove it; but when a large portion is invaded the operation is a serious matter.

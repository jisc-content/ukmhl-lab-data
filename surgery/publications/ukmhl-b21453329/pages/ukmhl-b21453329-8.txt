6 extensive^ and by whatever means of study acquired, is of no essential use unless it lias been put to the test of experienceâ€”an experience gained by the practice of surgery both in public and private. This double experience is, I think, important; for although the principles of treatment are the same, whether applied to a patient in the hospital or one in his own house, still the application of the principle must vary according to the means available for carrying it out. This remark is especially applicable to me- chanical surgery or the application of splints, bandages, and other apparatus, in the treatment of dislocations, fractures, and other casualties.

Besides this there are a number of surgical affections,

It is to be presumed that the future occupants of this chair will be men who have gained experience as practical surgeons, and naturally their services will be much in request, both by the public and their professional brethren. It follows, therefore, that only a limited portion of their time will be available for teachinof, and that will be concentrated on clinical work. In this respect clinical teaching differs from the syste- matic teaching of most of the fundamental branches of medical science. Anatomy, physiology, chemistry, botany, and zoology are best taught by men whose attention is not distracted by the anxieties of profes- sional practice, and who have time to work out, and think out, the problems which are constantly spring- ing up in the advancement of science. Their appropriate place is the laboratory and the study, and the facts which they deal with can be elucidated without any direct reference to the inroads of disease as seen in the living subject. Accordingly, for the professors of these branches to engage in medical practice, would seriously interfere with their useful- ness in investigating and teaching their several de- partments in science. But with clinical lecturers it is different. An extended practical experience in the treatment of disease, is necessary to make their instruc- tion of real value. Theoretical knowledge, however

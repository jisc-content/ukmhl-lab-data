27 venes, between tlie announcement of an undoubted improvement in surgical operations and its accep- tance by tlie profession. I bold in my band a little volume, published in 1806 by Dr. Jeffrey, at tbat time Professor of Anatomy in tbis University. It contains an account of several cases of excision of carious joints—two of the knee, by Mr. Park of Liverpool, performed as long ago as 1781, and three of the elbow, by M. Moreau in France, at tbe be- ginning of this century. It also contains a com- mentary on the subject by Dr. Jeffrey, and the, description of a saw which he invented to facilitate the proceedings. But the operation did not produce that impression on the surgeons of the day which might have been expected, and it lay almost in abey- ance till Mr. Syme rescued it from oblivion, and by adopting it systematically as a substitute for am- putation of the arm, became practically the intro- ducer into this country, of the now universal excision of the elbow. He also extended it to the shoulder, but strongly objected to its application to the wrist, hip, knee, or ankle. Other surgeons, especially Sir WilHam Fergusson, applied it to these joints; and Mr. Lister, while surgeon in our Infirmary, con- trived a systematic operation for removal of the wrist. This extensive manipulation, however, is rarely required—it often being sufficient to remove with gouge and forceps the diseased portions. In a week or two you will see in the Western Infirmary,

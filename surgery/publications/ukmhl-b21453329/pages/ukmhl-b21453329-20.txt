But Dr. Sims' example did not produce many imitators, probably from the extreme intricacy of the steps of the proceeding, so that in 1858 no operation of that kind had been done here except one by Dr. Wallace of Greenock, in nearly the way ad- vised by Dr. Sims. In 1858, Dr. Bozeman, a pupil of Dr. Sims, came over to visit this country, and was introduced to me. He brought the instruments with him, having made some slight modifications on them. He expressed a desire to exhibit the mode of opera- ting, and as I was acting temporarily for the late Mr. George Watt, surgeon to the Infirmary, I got the sanction of the superintendent to delegate the operation to a stranger.

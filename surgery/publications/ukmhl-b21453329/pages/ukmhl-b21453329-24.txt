This bold proceeding was in the first examples followed by a fatal result, but in a fourth case, by leaving the attachments to the chin un- divided^ he succeeded in removing tjie whole tongue with perfect success, the patient being able after- wards both to speak and swallow. It was obvious that the earlier operations were fatal in consequence of the extent of the mutilation and the division of the muscles, which steady the hyoid bone. On reflect- ing on the nature of the disease, it occurred to me that a much less severe mutilation might serve the purpose. Cancer of the tongue most frequently begins at the side, caused by friction against a broken tooth, or the irritation produced by smoking a short pipe. Its progress is gradually to creep backwards, but it rarely crosses to the other side till it has invaded almost the whole of that in which it began. A case of this disease was admitted under my care in the Infirmary, in May, 1865, which gave me the opportunity of putting my idea into execution. I followed the first steps of Mr. Syme's proceeding.

Examination of the excised half showed that my knife had gone quite beyond the disease. The patient made a good recovery, and is alive and well at the present day, in Lochranza, in Arran; she is known to almost every one on the island. I consider that

17 amples of deaths which would have happened in- dependently of the administration of chloroform ?" Three years ago, a patient, with a small tumour on the lip,was recommended to me by Professor Allen Thomson. The patient and his wife took apartments in the vicinity of my house for my convenience. A day was fixed for the operation; but on the morning I re- ceived an urgent call to the country, so that the opera- tion was postponed. The same evening the landlady called on me totellmethat her lodger had gone outfor a walk in the forenoon and had not returned. Next morn- ing I received the startling intelligence that my patient had fallen down dead on the street, at about midday, the very hour I had aiDpointed for the operation. Had I, at the critical moment, been administering chloroform, I have no doubt that I myself would have attributed to it the death which happened as I have stated. When I was house-surgeon in the Royal Infirmary, there was admitted to my wards a patient, suffering from vesico-vaginal fistula, at that time a most in- tractable affection. The gentleman under whom I was acting was an ingenious surgeon and clever operator—the late Dr. William Lyon—and he made many attempts to improve the patient by operative and other means, but without avail. As usual in such cases, the p^itient was dismissed, in static quo, although at the present day an operation would be performed with almost perfect certainty of success. B

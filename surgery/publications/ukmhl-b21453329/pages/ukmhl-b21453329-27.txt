25 incision recommended by most authors was evidently made without any well defined object, and naturally failed in its effect. By altering the position, direc- tion, and depth of the incision, I was enabled to divide those structures which I believe to be at fault, and the result altogether exceeded my ex- pectation. This is not the place to enter into detail; but some of the most obstinate cases have yielded after these deep incisions. The next example is a curious illustration of the application of physiological knowledge to the treatment of disease. It was originated by a Ger- man surgeon, in 1862; but it had suggested itself to me two years previously. In the winter of 18 5 9 I was engaged in making some dissections of the palate and pharynx, for the purpose of illustrating to my students the mechanism of swallowing. In examin- ing the levator palati muscle, I was satisfied that, in consequence of its origin from the lower part of the orifice of the Eustachian tube, its action in raising the soft palate would at the same time draw down and so open the orifice. It was obvious that the change in the position of the palate from its pen- dulous to its horizontal direction, would diminish the capacity of the upper or nasal compartment of the pharynx, and so expel some of the contained air from the nostril. Now, it occurred to me, that if the nostrils were firmly held together by the finger and thumb during an act of deglutition, advantage might

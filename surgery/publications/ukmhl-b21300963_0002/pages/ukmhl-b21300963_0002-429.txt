Let us then fuppofe, that a lumbar ab- fcefs treated in this manner continues to in- creafe, that it protrudes the integuments, that they, from diftentlon, become irritated; that their temperature is flightly augmented; what are we then to do ? Are we to wait till evident figns of inflammation appear ? I think not. I would then relieve them frorh diftention, by emptying the abfcefs through a wound made by an abfcefs lancet. I would open the abfcefs for a reafon which appears paradoxical on its firfl: propofal, which iÂ§, that it may be kept clofed. We can empty a cavity, and by healing the wound, keep it afterwards fhut, and no in- flammation enfues. If nature opens the cavity by ulceration, the opening is perma- nent, and the inflammation confequent mult be endured. When I firfl: treated abfceffes in this manner, I pundlured them with a trochar. I now ufe an abfcefs lancet, which is introduced with very little obliquity, fo far that

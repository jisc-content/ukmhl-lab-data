ON THE REMOVAL OF 220 of the capfule of the joint; for when the inte- guments were fuffered to regain their natural pofition, the wound in them was nearer to the patella, than the wound which was made in the capfule. The fal'cia which covers the joint being expofed by the divilion of the in- teguments, it was divided in a firnilar direc- tion, and nearly to the fame extent. The capfule was now laid bare, and I gently divided it to the extent of half an inch, where it covered one of the hard fubftances, which fuddenly flipped through the opening, and by preffing gently upon the other, it alfo came through at the fame part. The bodies, which were thus removed, were about three quarters of an inch in length, and half an inch in breadth. They .had a highly po- liflred furface, and were hard like cartilage. The fluid contained in the joint was preffed towards the wound, and about two ounces of fynovia were difcharged. I then drew the wound of the integument gently towards the patella, prefled the two Tides together, and clofed it accurately with flicking plafter, en- joining the patient to keep the limb as free from motion as poffible.

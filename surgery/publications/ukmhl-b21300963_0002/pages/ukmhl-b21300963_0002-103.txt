ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 9I In concuffion, the infenfible ftate is of fhort duration, and during its continuance the body is generally cold, and the pulfe feeble and intermitting. Afterwards the fkin is hotter than ufual, the pulfe and refpi- ration more frequent; the former often inter- mits, and the latter has not the ftertor of apoplexy.The pupil of the eye is not * dilated, but rather‘contradled. The coun- tenance exprelTes pain or uneafmefsj and vomiting occafionally takes place. The ftate of the patient is like that of a heavy and uncomfortable deep; yet, being roufed, figns, even of intelligence, appear. In fradlures of the bafis of the fkull, how- ever, it muft be acknowledged, that the fymptoms are often deceptive. In general the fymptoms refemble thofe of concuffion, yet fometimes a degree of infenfibility * But the abfence of ftertor muft not be relied on as a proof that there is no comprefhon; for Morgagni relates dilTecftions of apople«fHc perfons, where the effuGon was confiderable, yet no ftertor had occurred ^ aud I have feen cafes where it took place only in a very flight degree. may

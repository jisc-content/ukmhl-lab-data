If, however, a doubt Ihould be entertained on, this fubje6l, an.attention to fymptoms foon difpel it; when a nerve is irritated at any part between its origin and termination, a fenfation is felt as if fome injury were done to the parts which it ftipplies. If, therefore, the cutaneous nerves were injured, the inte- guments of the forearm would feem to ftjffer pain; but if the median nerve was wounded, the thumb and two next fingers would be affected with pain.

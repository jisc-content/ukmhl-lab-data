ON THE TIC DOULOUREUX. 2II nerves be fuppofed in thofe animals who pof- fefs them, to be the chief if not the foie or- gans for the preparation of this fubtile mat- ter, then it appears as neceffary that the nerves fliould communicate, as that the arte- ries fhould do fo. For if the continuity of the taink of either of thefe organs were de- ftroyed, the parts, which its branches fupply, would perifh were it not for their communi- cation with the minute branches of other adjacent trunks. It is probable that one of the advantages derived from important organs being fupplied from plexufes of nerves is, as has been fuggefted by Soemmerring, that fuch elTential organs fliould never want that animation and influence, which they derive from the nerves, even fliould cafual obftrudlion take place in fome of the trunks leading to fuch a plexus. But parts lefs eflential to life, equally require that fuch interruption of the nervous energy fliould be guarded againfl:. Have we not a plexus formed in the axilla, prior to the diftribution of nerves, to the upper extremities ? do not the facral nerves form a plexus, in order to form the ifchiadic or pofterior crural nerve ? p 2 and

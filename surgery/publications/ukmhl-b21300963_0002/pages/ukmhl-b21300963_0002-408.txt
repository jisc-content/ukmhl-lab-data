13* A CLASSIFICATION, &C. the mammary farcoma I fufpeft fome difcafed peculiarity to exifl:, as has been mentioned in fpeaking of that fubjedt. In the tubercu- lated farcoma the predilpofition to that diC- eafe feems general on the part of the confti- tution. In the medullary farcoma the difeafe feems local, in the firft inftance, and propa- gated by means of the abforbing veffels to their glands, and frequently in a courfe re- trograde to that which the abforbed fluids would naturally take; but in the advanced jftate of the difeafe the morbid difpofltion ap- pears to be general. In carcinomatous far- coma the difeafe appears to begin in a point or fmall difl:ri6t, and to extend in every direc- tion, as rays do from a center, affe6ling every -furrounding part, whatever may be its nature. The difeafed aftions alfo, though they may be at times more violent or more tranquil, .never ceafe. This difeafe is alfo extended through the medium of the abforbing velTels in the direction which the abforbed matter would naturally take.

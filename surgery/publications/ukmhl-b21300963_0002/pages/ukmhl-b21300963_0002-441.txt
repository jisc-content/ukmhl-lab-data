ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. CASE VI.

The patient was feeble, and of a fickly afpe6l, and I thought that the bone was difeafed. I defired him to remain in bed, and to keep open a moderate-fized blifter on the left fide of the loins; endeavouring, at the fame time, to produce, by means of me- dicines, an amendment in his general health. In about two months there was no appear- ance of any external abfcefs. The patient was now defired to get up daily, and walk in the open air, but to lie on the bed when he returned.

So frequently alfo arc there adhefions between the furface of the lung and the {ides of the thorax, that I think, in fome of the caies of emphyfema which I have feen, this circum- ftance mufl; have occurred, and that if the lungs had receded from the lides of the thorax^ the fymptoms would have indicated the lace- ration or flretching of thefe adhefions. An idea has generally prevailed among furgeons, that if the pleura coftalis were divided in the living fubjedf, the lung would immediately collapfe, as it is ufually found to do in the dead one. But M, Bremond * has {hewn by experiments, that not only when an opening is made into the cavity of the thorax, but even when {bme of the ribs are removed, the lungs Bill occupy their natural fituation, and are e\^en -thruft up into the opening during expiration. Mr. Norris has alfo lately {hewn, by experiments undertaken for this purpofe, as well as by obfervations on the effects of accidents, that fiequently the lungs do not collapfe when * Memoirs de Iâ€™Acad. des Sciences, 1739. th_5

A CLASSIFICATION 23 ftruclure is met with not only in diftinft tu- mours, but likewife in the teftis, mamma, and abforbent glands. In the teftis I have feen the veftels, very numerous and fmall, difperfed through every part of the tumour. In the mamma they feem to be rather large • than numerous, and the organization ap- pears lefs complete. When this kind of tumour has attained a conftderable ftze, the fuperficial veins appear remarkably large‘j on which account, to- gether with their curioufly meandering courfe beneath the fkin, they cannot fail to attract attention. Perhaps the weight of the tumour comprefles the deeper feated veins and obliges the blood to return in larger quantities through thofe nearer the furface j or perhaps tliefe veftels undergo a kind of fympathetic enlargement j for they do not appear to be diftended by the blood which they contain. Thefe tumours are generally dull in their fenfation j enduring even a rough examina- tion by the hand, and eledlric ftiocks, without becoming painful. 1 fufpedf that it is this kind of farcoma, which fornetimes, though rarely.

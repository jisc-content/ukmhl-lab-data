CONSEQUENCES OF VENJESECTION. 16^ it is however poflible, that the point of the lancet might injure a nerve lying beneath the vein* This will be eafily underftood by referring to the plate. Mr. Bell diredls an ex- tenfive tranfverfe incifion, to be made through the original wound; but if the injured nerve be fituated at -fhe upper extremity of the orifice, it will remain unafFedted by this ope- ration* Mr. Bell alfo advifes the incifion to be continued to the bone; but this appears to me dangerous and unneceflary. If the injured nerve be inflamed, I think it doubtful, whether even a total divifion of it, at the inflamed part, would effedlually relieve the general nervous irritation which the difeafe has occafioned. To intercept the communication of the inflamed nerve with the fenforium, does however promife perfefl relief. This intention can only be accom- plifhed, by making a tranfverfe incifion above the orifice in the vein. The incifion need not be very extenfive, for the injured nerve muft lie within the limits of the original orifice, and it need only defcend as low as the fafcia of the fore-arm: for all the fila- M 2 ments

ON INJURIES OE THE HEAD. Operation of trephining, in cafes where its neceffity is dubious, that it deprives the brain and its membranes of that natural fup- port which they receive from the bone. Un- der thefe circumftances, when inflammation comes on, the volume of the parts contained in the cranium, will be fo confiderably aug- mented by the prasternatural diilention of their veflels, and fubfequent effufion of fluids, as to be protruded up into one aperture. The dura mater is likely to give way, and the pia mater becoming expofed, will be more fubjeÂ£l to inflammation. It now fuflains the preflure which was formerly fupported by the dura mater, and in its turn ulcerates, and the brain will protrude and produce fungous excrefcences. Thefe circumftances are more particularly likely to happen in children; in them, indeed, the dura mater is fo firmly conne6ted with the bone, that it is rarely feparated by accidental violence, and it is even difficult to tear off the bone, when it has been perforated by the trephine. The argument againft immediately trephining the cranium, unlefs urged to it by great neceffity, applies, therefore, more ftrongly to

A CLASSIFICATION 3* This kind of farcoma frequently forms amidft the mammary gland, a little above, and on that fide of the nipple, which is next to the arm. Its appearance would lead one to fuppofe, that it was a lyrnphatic gland^ which is ufually found in that fituation, con- verted into this ftru6lure j but fometimes it feems like a diftin61; tumour. It is the ap- pearance of the capful e which in veils the tumour, that has led me to form thefe opinions. Thefe tumours leflen in bulk if judicioufly treated j but if they cannot be entirely dif- perfed, they increafe gradually: and when they have attained fome confiderable fize, they are generally removed, from apprehen- fion of the confequences which they might produce, if they were fuffered to remain. If the tumour be indolent, and if it increales flowly, the parts furrounding it, and the glands in the axilla are not affe6led. But fome tumours formed by this kind of difeafed flrudlure, which do not unfrequently occur in the bread;, are, contrary to the ordinary properties of fuch difeafes, of a very irritable nature.

OF TUMOURS. 125 liave therefore conjectured that thefe cyfts are enlargements of the burf<e mucofae. about two inches in length, to expofe the fafcia of the fore-arm, which I divided to the extent of an inch and a half. I then diftrafted the mufcles a little, when there gufhed out a large quantity of fluid, containing a number of the larged granules that ever I had feen formed in the (heaths of tendons. Several of them were as big as fmall grapes. By prefling the palm of the hand more were forced out, yet I remained uncertain whether the whole were difcharged. The wound was drefled fuperficially with fpermaceti falve, a bread and water poultice applied, and the arm kept fupported in a fling. Three days after the operation, fearing led fome of the granules might re- main, I introduced the point of a varniflied catheter, and impelled fome warm water beneath the fafcia of the hand. No granules returned with it; but this experiment caufed great nervous irritation in the part, and in the conditu- tion in general. Nothing therefore was further done • that could irritate the parts, and the wound healed in about fix weeks, in the following manner: The (kin on cither fide of the wound became tumid, and threw forth exuberant granulations to fuch a height, that a fwelling as big as half an egg cut lengthwife, projeded above the level of the (kin ; as the granulations from either fide touched, they coalefced, and thus the divided’fafcia was covered. The granulations being afterwards abforbed, the cicatrix appeared like one from a common cut, and the integuments were flat, and in a natural date. I faw the patient two years after this operation, and there had been no new colle£l:ion of fluid. The

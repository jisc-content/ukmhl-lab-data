ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 150 Having thus endeavoured to invcftlgatc the caufe of the evils refulting from a chronic abfcefs becoming open, I may further add, that if the opinions which I have formed of them be corredf, the danger muft greatly depend upon the dimenfions of the abfcefs. A chronic'â€˜abfcefs, beneath the fafcia of the thigh, may be opened, when it contains four ounces of pus; and if the furface becomes irritated and inflamed, it may induce a de- gree of conftitutional difturbance and fever ; yet fuch an abfcefs negledied, may increafe till it holds four quarts ^; and then, if it becomes open, and has the fame degree of local difeafe, and it were granted that it fhould only a6l upon the conftitution in the fame proportion, it muft produce more than thirty times the degree of fever. If alfo we are to afcribe the weaknefs confequent to the opening of chronic abfceftes in any degree to the drain of fluids which takes place from them, it will be in the fame proportion * I have difcharged four ale-houfe quarts full of matr ter from beneath the fafcia of the thigh. greater'

ON INJURIES OF THE tlEAD^ of concuffion. Every fiirgeon inuft ackiloW?Â» ledge that it would be a very defirable thing to afcertain when blood is effufed between the dura mater and the Ikull; for if the extras vafation has happened in the more interior* parts, a furgical operation is not likely to afford relief Now, if the extravafation which compreffes the brain, be fituated im- mediately beneath the bone, I think there are figns by which it will be difclofed 5 and as fufficient notice has not been taken of thefe, I widi particularly to call the attention of furgeoils to them. * In thofe cafes, which I have feeri, where blood waS extravafated between the dura and pia mater, and a divi- fion of the former membrane was made for its difchai'ge, in fome inftances the ferous part of it only could be eva- cuated ; for the coagulum was fpread over the hemifi phere of the brain, arid had defeended as low as pof* fible towards its inferior part; in others, though a portion of the eifufed blood was difeharged in a fluid ot grumous ftate, a confiderable quantity which was coagu- lated remained behind, fo that very little relief was obtained by the operation.

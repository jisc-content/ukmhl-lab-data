ipS ON THE OPERATION OF pofite fide of that organ. When I found tliat the inftrument had penetrated the cavity, I withdrew the ftilet within the canula, and then pufhed the canula obliquely down- wards, fo that about two inches of it were Introduced into the bladder. On withdraw- ing the ftilet of the trochar, the urine gullied out with great force, but I prevented its efcape, by placing the thumb of my left hand againft the mouth of the canula, and then introduced through it in the fame oblique diredlion, a middle fized hollow elaftic catheter, till it met with refiftance by touching the bottom of the bladder. After the urine was difcharged, the canula of the trochar was withdrawn over the elaftic ca- theter, which was left in its fituation, and the end which came out of the wound v/as bent downwards towards the pubes, and at- tached, fo as to be kept motionlefs, to a circular bandage put round the body of the patient. The wound, which was funnel- fhaped, being wide externally, and gradually contradling to the bladder, was covered with linen, fpread over with fpermaceti falve. The urine flowed not only through the catheter.

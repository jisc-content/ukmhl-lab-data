190 ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES.' I September 22d, a fortnight after the former evacuation, I difcharged four ounces of fimilar ferous fluid mixed with pus. Dur- ing its evacuation, which was very fpeedy, I had applied my fingers beneath Poupart’s ligament, as if to obftrudt the defcent of any matter from the loins. I then defired the man to cough, but no matter defcended, and the collection. appeared to me entirely con- fined to the thigh. I found fome difficulty in introducing a trochar, when the abfcefs contained fo little fluid. This was remedied by firfl: introduc- ing a lancet through the fafcia, and then conveying the trochar through the aperture made by the lancet. Thus after difcharging the matter four times, the complaint was reduced from a lumbar abfcefs, containing three pints, to a fmall colle6lion of matter beneath the fafcia, containing four ounces.—What communi- cation this had with the loins, and what was the flate of parts there, cannot be deter- mined. 15

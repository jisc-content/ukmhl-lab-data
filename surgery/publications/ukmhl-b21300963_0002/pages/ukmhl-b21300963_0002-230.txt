216 ON THE REMOVAL OF inner fide of the joint and it required only to put that part in a depending poiition, and thofe bodies defcended by their gravity through the fluid, and were eaflly fixed in the fituation to which they had fallen. I could bring them on the inner furface of the internal condyle of the os femoris, which is of confiderable extent, and by placing the points of my finger fo as to defcribe a por- tion of a circle, I could prevent them from pafling again into the cavity of the joint al- though the limb might be moved, and the patient prefs firmly againfi: them with his finger, as if he meant to pufli them into the joint. Yet when my fingers, which thus confined them were removed, the flighted: touch caufed them to difappear, and to glide with velocity into the general cavity of the joint. This is the fituation, and the manner in which I think thefe bodies can be mofl: con- veniently and certainly fixed. The inner furface of the internal condyle of the-os fe- moris prefents an extenfive and nearly plain furface, which terminates in front and at its upper

67 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. SECTION IV. ConcuJJio?! of the Brain. A s I am of opinion that the effe6ls of con- cuflion have not been juftly defcribed by authors, and as the fymptoms related by them are not, according to my experience, thofe which ufually occur, I have therefore felefted two cafes out of a great number tliat I have leen, in order to drew what have ap- denominatcd fungus or hernia cerebri. In all the cafes of true fungus cerebri which I had feen when I firft O % wrote the foregoing account, the fungus grew fo flowly that it could not be miftaken or confounded with the appearances which took place in the cafes I have cited. Since that period, I have feen cafes in which the fungus grew much more rapidly, yet none in tliat degree which would make it liable to be confounded with the appear- ances defcribed in the prefent fedlion. The curative indications in the true fungus cerebri feem to be, to diminifli thofe caufes wliich occafion the brain to be thruft upwards againft the bone, and to apply gentle prefTure from without, fo as to give that degree of fupport which the part ought naturally to receive from the dura mater bone.

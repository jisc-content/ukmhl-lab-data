*3 OF TUMOURS, Hill left, and this difeafe be not altered by the ftimulus of the operation, no benefit is obtained: thefe parts again produce a dif- eafed fubftance, which has generally the ap - , pearance of fungus, and, in confequence of being irritated by the injury of the operation, the difeafe is in general increafed by the means which were defigned for its cure. It appears therefore that in fome cafes of tu- mours, the newly formed part alone requires removal, whilft in others the furrounding fubftance muft be taken away, or a radical cure cannot be effe6led. There is yet another circumftance deferv- ing attention, before I proceed to the particu- lar confideration of the fubje61;; which is, that a tumour once formed, feems to be a fuf- ficient caufe of its own continuance and in- creafe. The irritation, which it caufes in the contiguous parts, is likely to keep up that increafed aftion of veffels which is neceftary to its fupply; and the larger it becomes, the more does it ftimulate, and of courfe contri- bute to its own uicreafe.

X4 on INJURIES OP THE HEAD. 6 In charged from the hofpital there was not the moft trivial circumftance which could induce us to fufpeft that the brain had fuftainedany injury from the accident. His deep was found and undillurbed, and the hidden mo- tion of his head in any dire6lion occafioned no giddinefs or inconvenience. It appears very clearly, I think, from thefe cafes, as well as from a great number of others to be found in books, that a flight degree of prefllire does not derange the fundtions of the brain, for a limited time after its application. That it does not do fo at firfl is very obvious; as perfons are often perfedlly fenhble^ and free from head-ach and giddinefs immediately after the injury. Whether it may not pro- duce fuch an effedt at fome remote period, is not fo eafily determined, fince this cannot be afeertained but by a continued acquaintance with the perfons who had received the injuries. All, however, whom I have had an oppor- tunity of knowing for any length of time after the accident, continued as well as if no- thing of the kind had ever happened to them.

The air which' efcapes from a wounded lung, and renders the cellular fubftance emphyfematous, produces no in- flammation of it. Air has alfo been blown into different cavities of the body, to afcer- tain its effeftsf and it has been abforbed from them without having excited any in- flammation. Neither does air appear to be ftimulating to the expofed furfaces of ulcers which are in a ftate of difeafe. Yet, though air leems to have no ftimulating property to . fuch furfaces, and therefore cannot be afligned as the caufe of that irritation and inflamma- tion confequent to the opening of an abfcefs, â– yet it is of the higheft importance in purfuing the treatment which I have recommended in thefe abfceftes, that no bubble of air ftiould be admitted into the cavity, becaufe it would probably caufe the putrefa6tion of the fluid contained in the abfcefs, the abforption of which would be very deleterious.

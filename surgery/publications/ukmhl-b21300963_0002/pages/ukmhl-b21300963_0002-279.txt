OF TUMOURS, ^ ferviceable in that dreadful difeafe, it be- comes right to remark, and it will appear from the following account, that there are many local tumours and ulcers, as in- tractable in their nature, and deftruCtive in their progrefs, as cancer, which are liable to be confounded with that difeafe, but which ought to be diftinguilhed from it, before any progrefs can be made in this difficult part of medical fcience. The fociety for the invefti- gation of the nature of cancer have enquired about the anatomical ftruClure of that difeafe, and about other diforders which have a re- femblance to it. In the prefent paper I have attempted to reply to fuch interrogations, as far as my knowledge enables me. It appears to me, that, in order fully to inveftigate any fubjeCl with advantage, a great deal of colla- teral knowledge is required, which ferves, like light fhining from various places, to illu- minate the obje6f of our refearches. I am not without hopes that this paper will tend to point out the required diftinClions,' and furnifh fuch collateral knowledge. B z Jxi

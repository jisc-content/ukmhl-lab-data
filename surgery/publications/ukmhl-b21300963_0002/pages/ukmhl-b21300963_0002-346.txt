The progrefs of carcinoma is more or lefs quick in different inftances. When flow, it is in general un- remitting j at leaft I am inclined to think that the difeafe, though it may be checked, can- not be made to recede by that medical treat- ment which leffens the bulk .of other farco- matous tumours. This circumftance affords, in my opinion, another criterion, by which it may in general be diffinguiflied. This obdurate and deffrudtive difeafe excites the contiguous parts, whatever their nature may be, to the fame difeafed adlion.

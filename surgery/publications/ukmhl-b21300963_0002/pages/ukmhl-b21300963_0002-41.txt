By dividing the fcalp, I had the power of reflefting a portion of the integuments, fo that I could trephine the bone, and remove the fhattered and depreffed pieces. I alfo took out a clot of coagulated blood as large as a walnut. The wound was clofed by (licking plafter, a comprefs laid over the part, and bound on by (licking-plafter. The patient was largely bled, and a dofe of purga- tive medicine was given. It was difhcult to determine whether the (leepy and ftupid (late of the patient was chiefly the effe6l of the injury or inebriety. She complained loudly during the operation. The next dav, when the (Indents of the hofpital wifhed to examine whether the dref- fmgs were difplaced or not, (lie refufed to per- mit them; but on my entering the ward, (he faid, aye, now he is come, you may examine if you pleafc. I need only add further, that a treatment calculated to prevent and con- trol) inflammation was ftridlly perfevered in, and that the patient (hortly became per- fedlly well. CASE

At the time this was efFedled, I believe the patient was in the a6l of expiration; for a blaft of air evidently iffued from the thorax; and afterwards, whilft the integuments were hept retradled, and the aperture in the pleura confequently uncovered, the external air con- tinued to rufli in during the enlargement of the thorax, and to be forced out again during its contra6lion. But when the divided Ikin was allowed to defcend to its natural fituation, and thus the opening of the pleura was co- vered, no farther paffage of air took place; and all that could then be perceived, was a .deprefiion of the integuments oppofite to the aperture in the thorax, occalioned by the prelTure of the atmofphere during the en- largement of that cavity. I had got ready a large injefting fyringe, and introducing the pipe into the eavity of the chefl, I drew up the pifton, and thus exhaufted the air, till I found I was flopped from proceeding by the lung which had rilen up and applied itfelf to the mouth of the fyringe. The fkin was then immediately brought down over the aper- ture in the thorax, and ferved like a valve, to

ON lumbar abscessed. i8g abfence. I now difcharged in like manner ten ounces of lymphatic exhalation, rather dark coloured and turbid, as if mixed with true pus. The man, during the laft week, had complained of pain in his loins and in his knee, both of which were relieved as ufual by the operation. Before the abfcefs was firft opened the im- pulfe of matter from the loins, on coughing, was extremely forcible, but was now not at all perceptible. It appears to me that a very confiderable advantage is derived from this mode of treating thefe complaints. What- ever fecretion is made in the abfcefs of the loins, will, by its gravity, defeend into the fpace left by the feceded fafeia of the thigh. The abfcefs of the loins being left perfcdtly free from diftention will moft probably con- tra6l to very little dimenfions, if it be not perfedlly abolifhed. Hence in the fubfe- quent treatment of thefe complaints you have only to attend to the difunited fafeia j whilft the cavity in the loins fcarcely deferves notice. September

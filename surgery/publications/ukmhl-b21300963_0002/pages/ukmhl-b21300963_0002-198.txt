As almoft all the circulating blood muft, in fuch cafes, be tranfmitted through the veffels of one lung, if the quantity of that fluid be not greatly diminilhed, the pul- monary veffels will become turgid ; a larger effufion of fluids will therefore tdke place into the air-cells and cavity of the cheft, and thus the function of the a6ting lung will be materially impaired. This reafoning illuftrates what experience has already deter- mined, viz. that the prefervation of life in thefe cafes depends on the moft copious blood-letting. The cafe, which I have related, clearly fhews, that the collapfed ftate of the lung affords an opportunity for the wound of its furface to heal; and when this defirable event is accomplilhed, the air which is at that time in the cavity of the thorax, will be fpeedily abforbed, and the ^ lung will again acquire

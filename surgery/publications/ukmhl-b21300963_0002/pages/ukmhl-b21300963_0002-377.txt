OF TUMOURS. lOI tude, fo that die bore the operation without the leaft complaint. Yet during the day preceding the operation, flie had a flight lumbago, as flie called it, which I believed to be the effeft of that anxiety of mind which the thoughts of undergoing the operation rnuft occafion. In the evening after the tumour had been removed, fhe complained of a defire, and of an inability to void urine; Hie had alfo fenfations in the throat like hyfferics. Her pulfe was 8o. She had no deep during the night, but had voided half a pint of urine, which had no ftriking pecu- liarity of appearance. Saline draughts had hitherto been given, and flie was now defired to take of ol. ricini, mixed with mucilage and cinnamon water, every fourth hour till a ftool was procured. She took feven draughts without any effecf. The pain in the back increafed, and during the fecond night was fo fevere, that fhe groaned very conflantly from the pain. On the third morning, I found her very ill, yet her pulfe was not more than 90, neither was her fKin hot. She had voided no urine for the laft 30 hours ; pain continued from the back down the H 3 thighs

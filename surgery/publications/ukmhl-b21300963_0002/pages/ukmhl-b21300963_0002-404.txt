128 A CLASSIFICATION Another genus of tumours is the olTeous, Thofe which hang pendulous into joints are fometimes bony. OlTeous tumours alfo form, though not frequently, in other parts : of this circumftance I lhall relate the follow- ing inftance. A woman was admitted into St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hofpital, with a hard tumour in the ham. It was about four inches in length and three in breadth. She had alfo a tumour on the front of the thigh a little above the patella, of lefs fize and hardnefs. The tumour in the ham, by its prelTure on the nerves and velTels, had greatly benumbed the fenfibility, and ob- ftrudled the circulation of the leg, fo that it was very osdematous. As it appeared im- podible to remove this tumour, and, as its origin and connexions were unknown, am- putation was refolved on. On examining the amputated limb, the tumour in the ham could only be divided by a faw; feveral dices were taken out of it by this means, and ap- peared to confift of coagulable and vafcular fubftance, in the interflices of which a great deal of bony matter was depolited. The remainder of the tumour was macerated and dried.

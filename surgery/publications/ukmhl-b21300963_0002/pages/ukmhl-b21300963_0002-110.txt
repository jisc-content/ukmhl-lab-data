98 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. In employed at the very commencement; for^ if omitted, the difeafe will then become efta- blilhed, and the powers of the body will foon be too much funk to admit of the fame active treatment at a later period. I have here reprefented the general effects of inflammation of the pia mater when it arifes from external violence. ^'In other cafes, indeed, where it comes on, as it were, fpontaneoufly, or without any powerfully exciting caufe (in which cafe it generally falls under the care of the phyfician), it has ap- peared to havq affe6fed the brain but little, and to have been very flow in its progrefs, and ina6five in its nature. In fuch cafes it has produced a depofition between the tunica arachnoidea and the pia mater, or a collec- tion of ferum between the former membrane and the dura mater. Under thefe circum- ftances, I have learned that the rationality of the patient has been fcarcely deranged. And as fuch a ftate of difeafe may occur after an accident, I have thought it right to men- tion it in this place.

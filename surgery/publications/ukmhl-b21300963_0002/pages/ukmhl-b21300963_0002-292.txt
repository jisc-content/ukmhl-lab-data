X CLASSIFICATIOK miflible a fubftance*, fo in proportion as the temperature of the Ikin is diminifhed by evaporation, it derives heat from the fubja- cent parts, and thus are their morbid adlions leflened-f. If by fuch means the growth of a tumour be fufpended, another curative in- dication naturally arifes, which is to pro- mote the abforption of the new formed fub- ftance. * Though this expreffion may not be corre£t, the idea which is defigned to be conveyed by it, will, I believe, be imderftood. f The regulation of the temperature of difeafed parts, feems to be an important objedb in the treatment of local difeafes ; and it is very poffible, that by producing eva- poration from the furface we may chill them. Patients, therefore, ought be apprized, that our object in the ufe of evaporating walhes, is merely to prevent an unna- tural degree of heat. It is not neceflary that the walhes fliould be applied cold to accomplifh this obje£f. A chilly fenfation imparted to a portion of the fkin may afFe£l: the whole furface, and produce that afFedfion which we call a cold. In many cafes, a bread and water poultice feems to me the belt application we can employ, both with a view to abftraft fuperfluous heat, and on account of its fobthing properties. It is indeed a local warm bath, and, like the bath, it induces a gentle perfpiration from the furface. This

CONSEQUENCES OF VENiESECTION. I49 by the adhefion be prevented. The effect of adhefion of membranes, in preventing the cxtenfion of inflammation along their fufr faces, is frequently apparent, and has been well explained by Mr. Hunter on another cccafion. In one cafe, Mr. Hunter applied a comprefs on the inflamed vein, above the wounded part, and he thought that he fuc- ceeded in producing adhefion, for the inflam- mation extended no further. In thofe cafes, where the inflammation does not continue equally in both direffions, but defcends along the courfe of the vein, it is probable that its extenfion in the other diredlion is prevented by adhefion. I have thus briefly and imperfedfly traii- fcribed Mr. Hunterâ€™s opinion, that the pre- fent Eflay might not be altogether deficient in information relative to this fubjedf. I have feen but three cafes where an inflam- mation of the vein fucceeded to venaefedfion; they, however, confirm tlie foregoing obfer- vations. The vein did not in either cafe evidently fuppurate.

A CLASSIFICATION I have lancet, and fqueezing out its contents. I thought it alfo probable, that the fmall wound would heal, and that the operation might be occahonally repeated. The patient was pleafed with the propofal, and it was put in execution. The contents were of the con- fiftence which is termed meliceritous, and had a peculiar odour. No inflammation en- fued, and the wound healed; but, after a little time, it opened again, and gave dif- charge to a fmall quantity of watery liquor, of precifely the fame odour as the original contents, and the little pun6ture again clofed up. From that time to the prefent, which is | now fome years, the wound has occafionally | opened, difcharging a fmall quantity of fome- times a more fluid, fometimes a more meli- ceritous fubftance j and, after this difcharge, the aperture clofes, up. This circumftance occurs but feldom j perhaps every fecond or third month. The aperture is fo fmall as not to be difcernible; no plaifter is worn upon j it, and the patient has got rid of a confiderable deformity, upon what he thinks very eafy and fatisfa^lory terms.

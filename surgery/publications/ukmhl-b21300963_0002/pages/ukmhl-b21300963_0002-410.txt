It alfo appears, that it is very much owing to the parts covering the front of the abfcefs partici- pating in the irritation, that the matter fo readily makes its way to the fprface, and is difcharged. On ,the contrary, in chronic abfceffes it generally happens, that very little adhefion of the furrounding fubftance takes place, and the matter is more at liberty to extend itfelf in all dire6tions j at the fame time, the parts covering it do nqt participate in the difeafe, they therefore do not inflame and ulcerate till their difliention induces them to do fo, and fuch a degree of diflention may not take place till the abfcefs has acquired an enor- mous magnitude.

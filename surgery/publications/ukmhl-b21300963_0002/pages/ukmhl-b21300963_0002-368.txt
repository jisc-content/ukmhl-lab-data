What additional circumftances lead to the eftablifhment of cancerous a6Hons in the local difeafe thus induced, we have yet to learn. Previoufly to the occurrence of cancer the nervous diforder, and that-of the digeftive organs, have, in general, been greater in degree, and longer in duration, than they are found to be antecedently to other difor- ders. Some patients having cancer die of organic difeafes in the head or abdomen. If the nervous and vifceral diforders are a6live and confiderable, the progrefs of the local difeafe will be, in general, proportionately rapid and deftru(51:ive j and if, on the con- trary, thefe diforders are mild, and lefs in degree, the progrefs of the local difeafe will be proportionally flow and gentle. In con- firmation of thefe obfervations, I may men- tion, that I have feen feveral inflances of cancer proceeding fo mildly, that the pa- tients have; lived many years with little fuf- fering or inconvenience from the local dif- eafe.

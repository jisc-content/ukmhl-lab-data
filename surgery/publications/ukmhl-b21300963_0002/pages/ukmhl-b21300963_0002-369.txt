93 OF TUMOURS. cafe, and particularly where attention has been paid to regulate the fun6lions of the digeftive organs With ** There can be no fubje£l which I think more likely to interefl the mind of a furgeon, than that of an en- deavour to amend and alter the ftate of a cancerous confti- tutioru The beft timed and beft conduced operation brings witli it noticing but difgrace, if the difeafed propenfities of the conftitution are aftive and powerful. It is after an operation that, in my opinion, we are moft particu- larly incited to regulate the conftitution, left the difeafe fhould be revived or renewed by its difturbance. In ad- dition to that attention to tranquillize and invigorate the nervous fyftem, and keep the digeftive organs in as healthy a ftate as poftible, which I have recommended in the firft volume, I believe' general experience fan£lions the recommendation of a mere vegetable, becaufe lefs ftimu- iating diet, with the addition of fo much milk, broth, and eggs, as feem neceflary to prevent any declenfion of the patient’s ftrength. Very recently, Dr. Lambe has propofed a method of treating cancerous difeafes, which is wholly dietetic. He recommends the adoption of a ftrict vegetable regimen, to avoid the ufe of fermented liquors, and to fubftitute wa- ter, purified by diftillation, in the place of common w'a_ ter ufed as a beverage, and in all articles of diet in which common water is ufed, as tea, foups, &c. The grounds upon which he founds his opinion of the propriety of this advice, and the profpe£l of benefit which it holds out, may be feen in his « Reports on Cancers,” to which j refer my readers.

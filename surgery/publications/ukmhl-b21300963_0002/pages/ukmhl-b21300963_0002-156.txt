There is another circumflance, which de- ferves attention; when the abforbents be- come inflamed, they quickly communicate this difeafe to the cellular fubftance, by which they are furrounded. Moll furgeons have remarked thefe veflels when indurated, to appear like fmall chords, perhaps of .one- eighth of an inch in diameter; this fubftance is furely not the flender fides of the veffel thus fuddenly augmented in bulk, but an induration of the furrounding cellular fub- ftance, to which the irritated veflel has com- municated inflammation. The formation of a common bubo is another inftance of the power, which thefe veflels poflefs, of in- volving the furrounding parts in their dif- eafe ; at firft one or two glands are found to be inflamed, but they foon become undif- tinguifhable, in the general inflammation of the furrounding fubftance. This inflamma- tion either is difperfed, or it terminates in fuppuration: and on the fubfidence of the general

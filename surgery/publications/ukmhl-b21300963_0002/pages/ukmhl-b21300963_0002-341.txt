It feems therefore as if the difeafed aftion caufed the fecretion of a fluid, fometimes of a milky, fometimes of a more dufky huej which gradually acquires folidity, and augments the bulk of the part. The difeafed part acquires in general a con- fiderable folidity when it has continued for fome time, fo as fcarcely to deferve the names of foft cancer, or medullary farcoma. - The hardnefs is alfo, in fome inftances which I have feen, increafed, apparently by a thick- ening of the cellular fubflance which per- vades the gland. It feems probable, however, that the fame kind of difeafed action may not be always followed by the like alteration of flrudfure, in the part which it affefts. Mr. Aftley Cooper, in his Paper on Obftrudlions of the Thoracic Du6f, mentions an inftance in which matter imbibed from a teftis affedled Mith a difeafe like the prefent, obftru6led VOL.IV. F that

CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. I4S It might be fufpefled, that in the cafes which have been related, the lancet which was employed was envenomed; and that the abforption of virulent matter was the exciting caufe of inflammation: the defcent of the difeafe to the inferior abforbents, in the two iiift cafes, oppofes that opinion; and it is further invalidated by the obfervations which I fiiall proceed to offci*. Since the ftrudturc and functions of the abforbing veflels have become fo well known, the atten- tion of medical pradtitioners has been diredled to their difeafes, and much novel informa- tion has been acquired. That which relates to the prefent fubjedf, 1 fhall endeavour briefly to ftate. Phyfiology fliews to us, that the ^bforbents poflefs much fenfibility. Pradical obfervatioii ftrengthens this opi- nion : the celerity with which thefe veflels inflame, when they have imbibed noxious matter, and the pain which is fufibred in confequence, fufliciently prove this circum- ftance. Their frequent inflammation, in confequence of diflurbance of the general conftitution, may be however regarded as an additional argument. A common cold pro- duces

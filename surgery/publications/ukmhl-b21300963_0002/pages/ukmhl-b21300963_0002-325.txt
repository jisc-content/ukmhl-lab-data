OF TUMOURS. 49 glandular parts perhaps; which might, with propriety, be confidcred as a variety of the fame fpecies of farcoma. It has the fame uniformity of furface, but it is not always of a white colour, being occafionally of a brownifli or reddifli tint. I have feen a fub- fiance of this kind forming a tumbur fur- rounding and comprefling the oefophagus,and caufing a contradlion of that tube. I have feen this kind of farcoma in glandular parts, in which the progrefs and event of the cafe did not indicate the difeafe to be of a noxious nature. The general refult of my obferva- tions, however, has induced me to believe, that this difeafed flrufture is prone to dege- nerate into an intradlable ulcer, which will communicate its difeafe to the furrounding parts, and I have therefore placed this fpecies of farcoma between thofe which feem to pofTefs no malignity, and thofe which follow, and which are of a very deflrudlive nature. I add the relation of a Cafe which oc- curred at St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hofpital, fine? the publication of the former edition of th;s j)aper. VDL. IV. F. CASE

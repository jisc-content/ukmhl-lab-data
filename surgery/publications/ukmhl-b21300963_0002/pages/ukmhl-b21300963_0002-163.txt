CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. IfX • L 4 the vein, appears to be particularly ju- dicious. I am induced to fuppofe, a cafe may occur' in which the vein may fuppurate, and in which a total divilion of the tube may be proper pracfice; not merely to obviate the extenfion of the local dileafe, but to prevent the colledfed pus from mixing with the circulating fluids. - Infammation of the Fafcia of the Forearm. As far as my obfervation has extended, the next frequent ill confequence which fuc-^ ceeds to vensefeftion performed in the arm, is an inflammation of the fubjacent fafcia. When this complaint occurs, it perhaps ariies not merely from the contiguity of the fafcia to the pundtured and irritated parts, but it is probable that it was wounded ’by the lan- cet in the operation. I hope that the cafes which I fliall relate, and thofe to which I can refer the reader, will convey fufflcient in- formation of the fymptoms and effects.of this difeafe. CASE

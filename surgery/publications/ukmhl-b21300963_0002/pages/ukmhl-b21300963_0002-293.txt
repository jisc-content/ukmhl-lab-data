OF TUMOURS. ^7 This indication is generally attempted by the ufe of ftimulants, fuch as fridlions with mercurial ointment, preffure, and eledlricity, or by means which alfo excite fome counter irritation, as rubefacient plaf^ ters, folutions of falts, blifters, and iifues. Both reafon and experience equally demon- ifrate the impropriety of ufiiig the ftimulat- ing plan till the difeafe is firft tranquillized, and in a degree fubdued. It is reafonable to expedl that ftimulating meafures will increafe the adlions, which are going on in the dif- eafed part; and experience proves that dif- eafes are often increafed by thofe very means which, had they been employed at a proper time, might have effected their cure. This may be elucidated by a fa6l which is, I believe, generally known and admitted, that if a blifter be applied for the cure of a pleu- rify before evacuations are made ufe of, and the adivity of the difeafe be thus checked, it aggravates the difeafe; if afterwards, it fpeedi- ly effeds a cure. If a tumour or any local difeafe be for a time benefitted by ftimulating difcutients, and the difeafed adions recur in it with a degree of adivity; it is better to VOL. IV. c defifl

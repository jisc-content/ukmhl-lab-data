5 OP TUMOURS. , difeafes of arteries, veins, glands, tendons, joints, and bones, brought together under one order, and defignated by the fame name of timours. Some of thefe alfo are merely enlargements of natural parts; whilft others are entirely new produ6lions, having no exift-^ ence in the original compofition of the body, We have, I believe, fufficient knowledge of the nature of thefe difeafes to clafs them more fcientifically; and as this has not yet, as far as I know been done, I lhall endea^ vour to fupply the deficiency. In the definition which I mean to give of tumours, I fhall trefpafs as much,againfl the ufual import of the word, as nofologifts have hitherto done in their clalFifications againfl the nature of the difeafe. For I fhall refliidt the furgical fignification of the word Tu- mour” to fuch fwellings as arife from fome new produ6lion, which made no part of the * Plenck publiftied, 1767, a work Intltled “ Syftema Tumorum,” which I have not feen, but I conclude that it does not refemble the prefent attempt; fince no arrange- ment, like that which I have made, is to met with in th? Encyclopedic Mcthodique. » 3 original

ON LUMBAR. ABSCESSES. tjt Very fmall ele6lric fhocks * were accordingly fent from different parts by the fide of the lumbar vertebrae, down to the groin, and upper part of the affe6led thigh j and, under this treatment, the contents of the abfeefs foon difappeared; nor did any further col- le£fion of matter take place during the time of her remaining in the houfe, which was nearly two months. The eleftridty alfo brought on the menn;rual difeharge, which for a long time had been very irregular; and her general health was greatly improved be- fore fhe left the hofpital -f-. * Thefe fmall fliocks, which, for the fake of diftinc- tion, I {hall call eleGric vibrations (a term, I believe, generally applied to them), were made by difeharging a fmall jar, the coated furface of which did not exceed fourteen fquare inches: and by placing the ball of the ele£lrometer at a fmall diftance from the conductor, ge- nerally about a quarter of an inch. One of the difeharging rods was then moved about on the upper part of the thigh, and the other on the loins, fo that the eleftric fluid might pafs through the abfeefs. f I have lately heard, that the abfeefs has not appeared again, though a year has fmee elapfed; but the pain in her loins, has (as might have been expedted) recurred.

ON LUMBAR ABSCESSESi tlifcharge, and hedlic fymptoms, which fo qiiently occur in this diforder. In the fecond cafe, as the patient’s general health was tolera- bly good, the difeafe in the beginning ap- proached to the nature of common inflamma- tion, then gradually acquired the ufual flate of thefe abfcefles, but afterwards became in- dolent ; the fympathetic affe6lion of the con- ftitution exa6lly correfponded to the flate of the abfcefs. At firfl the fever was inflam- matory, then hedlicalj and when the local complaint became indolent, the general flate of the patient’s health was no longer affeded. Thefe circumflances flill more flrongly ap- peared after the accidental re-excitement of the inflammatory fymptoms. In order further to confirm the foregoing opinions, I may add; that I have known a confiderable fpace of time elapfe, betv/een the firfl burfling of a lumbar abfcefs and its afliim- ing that morbid flate which is fo peculiar to thofe difeafes, and which produces a corre- ^onding affedion of the fyflem in general. 5 I N I S Strahan and Pi-efton, J’xintcrs-Strect, ijpnd<;n«

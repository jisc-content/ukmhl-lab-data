INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 1/ prejudiced againft the ufe of the trephine, might, with equal injuftice, confider the mif- chief, which enfues in certain cafes, as entirely- owing to the operation. The degree of prelTure, which the brain can fuftain without great injury to the fyftem, may probably, vary according to the difpofitioii of that organ to be affedled by it, the fud- dennefs of its application, and the diredlion in which it is made: and although it muft be very difficult to obtain any precife know- ledge on this fubjedl, yet there is great reafon to believe that the brain can bear more pref- fure without injury to it, than was formerly fuppofed. The firft of thefe circumftances feems evident; for in fome perfons a flight preffiire produces fevere fymptoms j whilft, in others, a much greater degree is borne with- out inconvenience. We can rarely judge of - the effedls of prefTure when any part of the cranium is beaten in by a blow; for in that cafe the fhock generally occafions flupefac- tion. Internal haemorrhages, perhaps, afford us the befl criterion whereby to determine the effedls of prefTure on the brain. The VOL. III. c eighth

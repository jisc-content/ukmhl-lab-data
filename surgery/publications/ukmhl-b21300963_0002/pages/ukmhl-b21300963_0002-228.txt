6N THE REMOVAL Of &I4 I they flip under the ligament of the patella, and become interpofed between the condyles of the os femoris and the tibia, they impede ' progreflion, and caufe pain, and fo much injury as to bring on inflammation in the joint. If the extenfor tendons, the patella and its ligament, can, by Mr. Keyâ€™s ban- dage, be kept ftcadily prefled againfl: the cor- refponding parts of the joint, then thefe bodies mufl: remain ftationary on one or other fide of the patella, and the patient will be exempted from the inconvenience and in- jury which their motion in the joint occa- flons. Under thefe circumftances the necef- flty for an operation is obviated j but in the cafe which I am about to relate the bandage was of no avail, for reafons which will ap- pear in the relation. It is not improbable alfo that though thefe bodies may occafion much irritation at firfl:, yet that the joint becoming accuftomed to their Aim ulus may afterwards be lefs aftefted by their prefence, which circumftance ought to be adverted to and afcertained before- an operation be under- taken.

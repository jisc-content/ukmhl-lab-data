Ot? TUMOURS. Si parts get well whilft the furrounding parts become difeafed. I have known difeafes be- ginning in ulceration, and followed by in- duration, and the growth of fungus extend themfelves unremittingly, fo as to deftroy the patient. I have feen difeafes of this defcription occur in the labia pudendi, fome of which have terminated fatally, whilft others were removed even at an advanced period of the difeafe with fuccefs. Here fome additional difcriminating cir- cumftances feem to be wanted, by which wc may diftinguilh between thefe ulcers and common carcinoma. I have never remarked, that fuch ulcers have affedted the abforbent glands, though I do not feel affured that this occurrence never takes place. It therefore remains to be detennined by future cafes, how far this circumftance may enable us to decide on the nature of thefe difeafes. I fhall next relate the principal circumftances of a remarkable cafe of this kind of difeafe, which will ferve to elucidate the fubjedl, and alfo to exhibit a fpecimen of the difeafes to which I allude.

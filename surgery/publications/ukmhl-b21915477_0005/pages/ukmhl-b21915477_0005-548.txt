INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FACE, CHEEKS, AND LIPS. 488 while the two lateral triangles have their bases at the commissures of the lips, and their apices directed outwards upon the cheeks. Fig. 989 represents the reconstructed lip, the lateral flaps being brought together in the median line, and at the same time being lifted up by their attachment to the cheeks. Fig. 988. Fig. 989. Restoration of border of lower lip. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 990 represents a much more extensive loss of substance, involving the whole breadth of the lower lip and the right angle of the mouth. To cover the deficiency, two flaps of unequal size are dissected from the cheeks, the smaller one on the right, above and without the right angle of the mouth, the larger one on the left, chiefly below and without the left angle of the mouth, and extending below the base of the jaw. The reconstructed lip and the lines of union of the flaps are seen in Fig. 991. Fig. 990. Fig. 991. Restoration of lower lip and angle of mouth. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 992, exhibits a remarkable fissure of the upper lip, in which the sides of the fissure extend in a direct line from the columna nasi to the angles of the mouth. To remedy this defect, a curved incision is carried on each side

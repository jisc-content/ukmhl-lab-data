INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE AIR-PASSAGES. 656 with the following summary; indefinite “ fractures of larynx” 7; thyroid only 30 ; cricoid only 11; thjn’oid and cricoid 9 ; thyroid, cricoid, and trachea 2 ; cricoid and trachea 3 ; thyroid and hyoid bone 4; thyroid, cricoid, and liyoid bone 2 ; cricoid, trachea, and hyoid hone, 1. Ossification of the cartilages is hardly the important element in the injury that it was formerly supposed to be, for of 46 cases of fracture of the larynx and trachea collected l>y Gurlt,' 16 occurred in individuals between nine and thirty years of age, 12 in males and 4 in females. The thyroid car- tilage alone was injured in 6 of these 16 cases, the cricoid alone in 1, the trachea alone in 1, the “larynx” in 2. Of the 27 cases collected by Hunt, 5 had occurred in children. Fractures are sometimes associated with contused, incised, lacerated, and gunshot wounds of the integument and of the laiynx itself. The causes of fracture of the larynx are attempts at choking with the hand, whether premeditatedly or during a struggle ; blows with the fist, foot, or a hard weapon, such as a billet of wood ; falls upon hard objects ; awkward hanging f and crushing violence. Mackenzie^ records one from an acrobatic jump upon the patient’s neck. Treulich records a multiple fracture in a patient whom a horse seized by the throat and lifted from the ground. Fig. 1030.

(Boe.6) Fracture of the thyroid may be single or multiple, complete or incomplete. The single fracture is usually vertical. Its most frequent seat is anteriorly, 1 Op. cit. 2 For a recent example, see Porter, Archives of Laryngology, vol. i. p. 142 (illustrated). 3 Op. cit., p. 402. < Archives of Laryngology, April, 1881, p. 129. s Ibid., p. 130.

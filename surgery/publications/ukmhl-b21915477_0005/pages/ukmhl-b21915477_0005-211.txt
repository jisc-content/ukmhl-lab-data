ANATOMY OF THE EYE. 171 thalmus, diplopia, and other serious troubles. I have seen several cases of cyst in the ethmoid, that crowded the contents of the orbit, and had to be treated surgically, to save the eye. Cases of fistula of the frontal sinus, pre- senting above the tendo oculi, have been sent to me for fistula lachrymalis. Fig. 843. Horizontal section through tho orbit of an adnlt male. B.

The bony orbit lodges tlie eye, the optic nerve, the six rotatory muscles and their nerves, sensory nerves, numerous bloodvessels, and a large amount of cellulo-adipose tissue, which gives soft support to the eyeball. (Fig. 843.) Optic ISTerve.—Tlie optic nerve, entering the orbit through the foramen oi>ti- cum, and measuring about 4 mm. in diameter, runs forwards, in a tortuous manner, to the sclerotic, slightly heloiv and inwards from the posterior pole of the eye, which it pierces in an opening 1.5 mm. in diameter. Its entire length, within the orbit, is 28 or 29 mm. The nerve is closely embraced by a neurilemma, which is continuous with the i>ia mater, and Avliich semis numer- ous septa inwards, to divide the fibres into separate bundles. Through these

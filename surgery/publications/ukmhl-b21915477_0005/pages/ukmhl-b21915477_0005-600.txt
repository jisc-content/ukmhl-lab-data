540 INJURIES AND DISEASES OE THE MOUTH, TONGUE, JAWS, ETC. Museum of University College, London, is of this nature, springing from the antrum and projecting through its anterior wall, and also through the hard palate. 6. Chondrosarcoma^ in which spindle-celled or round-celled sarcoma is mixed with the cartilage which forms the hulk of the tumor, occurs in both jaws, and frecpiently leads to secondary deposits in the lungs. I have elsewhere^ recorded the case of a woman, aged forty-four, from whom I removed a large piece of the lower jarv with an enchondromatous tumor of large size, the patient being discharged from hospital twenty-one days after, with the wound quite healed, and with no signs of recurrence. Eleven weeks after being discharged, she was readmitted with a recurrence of disease on both sides of the gap in the lower jaw, and a second operation was per- formed ; but it was found impossible to remove the whole of the groAvth, which had spread into the pterygoid region. A large, fungating mass formed and protruded externally, and the patient sank on the forty-third da}" after the second operation. At the autopsy, the mass of growth extended from the zygoma doAvnwards for over seven inches, and Avas from five to six inches in thickness. Another tumor sprang from the right segment of the divided jaAv, and the left side of the tongue and floor of the mouth were largely invaded. The upper jaAv Avas not involved, but only imbedded in the growth, Avhich had forced itself deeply among the neighboring parts, Avhere the A'eins were filled Avith flrniAvhite clots, though no groAvth had sprung up in connec- tion with their Avails. The tumor on section varied in color, being }mlloAvish- wliite in some parts, Avhilst it Avas red and vascular in others, and mottled Avith patches of extravasated blood. It Aveighed tAvo pounds and three ounces. There Avere two nodules of secondary groAvth in the left lung, and three larger ones in the right lung. One of these Avas distinctly seen to be lying in the course of a good-sized brancli of the pulmonary artery, whose AA^alls Avere expanded over it. It did not completely block the lumen of the vessel, and on its surface Avas a Avhite fibrous deposit. The mass reniOAmd at the first operation consisted chiefly of enehondroma with dim hyaline and fibrous matrix, but interspersed Avere islets of round- celled sarcoma. The recurrent masses Avere made up chiefly of round-celled and spindle-celled sarcoma, whilst scattered throughout Avere isolated portions of cartilaginous tissue Avith fibrous matrix. 7. The names osteosarcoma and osteoid chondrosarcoma imply the occur- rence of ossification in tumors containing sarcomatous elements, and include the cases hitherto described as “ osteoid cancer.” A good specimen of the kind is preserved in the Hunterian Museum, and is figured in IIoAvship’s “ Surgical Observations.” The preparation has been macerated, and the part Avhich remains consists of an oval mass of light, cancellous bone, about live inches in its chief diameter, and very slightly connected Avith the remaining bones of tlie face. At its loAvest part, it preserves someAvhat of the form of the alveolar border of the upper jaAV; and the incisor, canine, and bicuspid teeth are implanted in it. The frontal bone shoAvs evidence of a secondary groAvth from Avithin it. The patient Avas a Avoman of thirty, and had had the tumor, Avhich is described as “ fleshy,” for five years, dying from hemor- rhage consequent upon extraction of a tooth. A good example of ossifying sarcoma in the loAver jaAv, has recently been under my care, in a man of fifty, from Avhom, in May, 1881, I 'removed a portion of the horizontal ramus of the loAver jaAV, cutting Avell beyond a fleshy tumor Avhich involved it, and Avhich had been groAving some months. A recurrence took place, and I disarticulated the jaAV on the affected side • Lancet, November 24, 1877.

For Fig. 905. ordinary purposes, there is no better nor more convenient light that that which is furnished by the argand gas-burner, mounted upon a drop- light or stand, which permits of the flame be- ing lowered or elevated at will, or upon the arm of a gas bracket fastened to the wall. Such a light certainly is easily ju’ocurable, and at a slight cost if gas is obtainable; if not, as in the country, the ordinary lamp known as the “ student,” which burns petroleum or oil, forms a very eflicient substitute. It is no difficult matter to attach to either of these lights a single plano-convex lens, two and one-half inches in diameter, which fits into the metallic tube or chimney known as Mackenzie’s, if it be deemed desirable to intensify their illumi- powers, as will probably be the case when it is remembered that the light for rhinoscopy should necessarily be more intense than that used for laryngoscopy, and that sunlight is here unavailable. natmg Fig. 906.

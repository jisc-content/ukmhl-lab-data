666 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE AIR-PASSAGES. substances, but cases ai’e known of penetration into the trachea of a foreign body from the oesophagus,' of a necrosed portion of the sternum,^ of diseased bronchial glands,® of pulmonary abscesses,^ of the contents of tuberculous cavities,® of purulent pleural effusions,® and of blood from pulmonary hemor- rhages and aneurisms; cases are also known of ulceration into a bronchus’' of a bronchial gland, of escape of food from an oesophago-tracheal perfora- tion,® and of foreign bodies introduced by wound or disease into the thoracic cavities—including bullets, clothing, fragments of bone, fragments of a watch- movement, and pieces of glass.® Many cases of foreign body in the air-passage occur in children having their playthings in their mouths. Many of these accidents take place while the individual is drinking, laughing, coughing, or talking. In another group of cases, the sudden inspiration which drives the substance into the air-tube is produced by a startling blow, a slap on the back, or even b}^ tickling the neck.'® An experimental effort to sound a whistle by an inspi- ratory effort, has driven the loose reed into the left bronchus." Suction some- times detaches the moutli-piece from a feeding-bottle, and draws it into the air-passage.'® A curious case has been recorded in the daily papers, of suffo- cation from a kernel of corn, driven into the windpipe of a man by the cough of a feeding horse.'® The variety of objects which produce the accident seems endless," embracing anything from a bean or a grain of corn—which, accord- ing to the researches of Weist,'® is the most frequent object in America—to a toy locomotive'® or the larynx of a goose.'’ The sul joined classification by Poulet,'® based on Bourdillat’s statistics, which include more than three hundred cases, shows concisely the variety of substances which have given occasion to the accident.

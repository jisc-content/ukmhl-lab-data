Laryngoscopy. Laryngoscopy—inspection of the interior of the larynx—is eftected by means of a small mirror so mounted as to he readily passed into the mouth and placed in a position which will reflect the image of the larynx. The same principle has long been employed by the dentist to obtain images of such portions of a tooth as are out of the line of direct inspection. It is to the experiments of Manuel Garcia, of London, a teacher of singing, that modern surgery is indebted for a knowledge of the laryngoscope d it is to Prof. Czermak, of Pesth, that is due its reception into the medico-ehirurgical armamentarium f and it is to Prof. Tuerck, of Vienna, that medicine is chiefly indebted for copious clinical representations of its great usefulness in diagnosis and treatment.^ All that is needed to examine the larynx and adjoining structures, in the presence of a good light, is a good glass mirror, mounted on a rod firm enough to resist being bent by the muscular action of the soft palate. A circular mirror one inch in diameter (Fig. 1020).will suflice for most purposes in the adult. Smaller mirrors are sometimes needed with adults, and almost always with children. Fig. 1020. Lauyngoscopic mirror. The position of the mirror in the mouth, and the general features of the image of the normal larynx as seen in it, are fairly represented in Fig. 1021. The manipulation of the laryngoscopic mirror may be loriefly described as follows: The mouth of the patient being well illuminated liy natural or ' Physiological Ohservatioiis on the Human Voice.

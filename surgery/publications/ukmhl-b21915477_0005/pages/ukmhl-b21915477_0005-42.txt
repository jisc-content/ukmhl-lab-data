INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 2 side. The aponeurosis covers the whole vault of the skull, and is continued laterally by a laminated layer of areolar tissue to the zygoma. Hence it will be seen that subaponeurotic fluid collections cannot pass lower, posteriorly, than thepointsof attachment of the trapezii muscles; that anteriorly, fluid will gravi- tate into the eyelids and form a pouch over the root of the nose ; and that later- ally, the z}’gomatic arch is the lowest point attainable for a purulent collection. The cellular tissue wliieh forms the bond of connection between the aponeu- rosis and the pericranium is exceedingly lax, permitting the former with its firmly adherent integument to glide readily over the calvaria. It ivill be at once seen that a wound penetrating the aponeurosis, on account of this laxity of the cellular tissue, will gape, and if raised in the form of flap may be extensively" displaced. The vascular and nervous supplies of the scalp must not be forgotten with I'cference to the arrest of hemorrhage, and the neuralgias that occasion- ally follow injuries. The arteries of the seal}) are derived from the temporal, occipital, auricular, su})ra-orbital, and frontal. Vessels arising from these trunks ]:)enetrate the deeper structures to ramify in the })eriostenm. The veins of the })ericranium aijd of the scal}j, the di})loic veins, and those of the dura mater, or even the cerebral sinuses, intercommunicate, thus present- ing in their cellular coats a continuous tract of connective tissue, along which external inflammation may travel to the diploe, and even to the brain. The nerves of the seal}) are the occi}fltalis major and occipitalis minor, the auric- ulo-teni})oral, the })Osterior auricular, the su})ra-orbital, and the facial. Contusions of the Scalp.—Owing to the anatomical structure of the scalp, certain })eculiarities of form are })resented by contusions, which sometimes give rise to difficulties in diagnosis. The swelling from a blow u})on the scal}^ occurs within a few seconds, and is due to the ra})id effusion of blood and serum. It is shar})ly defined, and does not insensibly blend with the surrounding })arts. If examined within a few hours, a soft, central de})ression is felt, surrounded by a hard, elevated margin, giving the im})ression of a depressed fracture; and this is all the more dece})tive if, as in some instances, a ru})ture(l artery communicates with the effusion, when the sensation com- municated to the hand closely simulates that of cerebral })ulsation.‘ The central depression with the surrounding hard margin, receives its ex})lana- tion from the character of the dense, inelastic, cellulo-adi})Ose, siq^erflcial fascia, M'hich is btdented at the })oint of im}3act, while the dis})laced fat, with the surrounding })arts infiltrated with blood and serum, Ibrrns the hard margin. The diagnosis between this condition and a de})ressed fracture, can be made by })ressing firmly witli the finger at the bottom of the de})ression ; if there be no fracture, the surface can be still further indented, when the bone will usually be detected smooth and imde})ressed. The indurated margin itself can also be indented by })ressure with the finger nail, which would not be the case in fracture. There are, besides, no symptoms of cerebral com})ression. It must be confessed, however, that, in certain instances, ex})e- rienced surgeons have cut down ex})ecting to find a dc})ressed fracture where none has existed, and again, that, after the effusion has been absorbed, a de}:)ression has been found where none had been su})})Osed to exist. Attention to the diagnostic points just detailed should render such mistakes of rare occurrence. The degree of the contusing force may be so slight that the con- sequences }!)ass away within a few hours, or so severe as to actually }julpify the scalp, although gangrene is of rare occurrence. 1 J.

The rubber tubing from the cylinder is usually made to fit to that on the glass atomizers by means of a bayonet- joint, but the more elaborate device here shown (Fig. 924) may be employed. Fig. 924. Spray-tulie with patent cut-off. In default of this apparatus, the ordinary hard-rubber atomizers, con- structed upon the principle of either Richardson or Bergson, may be used with good effect. In both, the propelling power is developed by the use of the hand air-bulbs. These should always be double; a single air-bulb gives but an intermittent current of spray; the addition, between the hand-bulb and atomizer, of a second and more elastic one, which becomes distended, by exerting a continuous pressure will furnish a stead}^ and constant stream. The hard-rubber tube of the instrument is provided with three separate tips, arranged to throw the spray in the directions necessary; and its main disadvantages are, the length of time that it takes to develop the pro- pelling power by means of hand-ball pressure, an important point when the Fig. 925. u a Atomizer throwing spray downward. instrument is in position in an ir- ritable throat,ancl the fact that the current of spray is not absolutely and quickly under the control of the operator. As a rule, then, the application with this instrument Fig. 926. Another form of atomizer.

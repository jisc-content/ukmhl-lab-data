INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE AIR-PASSAGES. 732 (Fig. 1086), perhaps the best of its class, which protects the adjaceut tissues trom the knife; but they can be used only with growths small enough to be encircled by the annular blade, and their usefulness is therefore much re- stricted. Personally, I am not partial to any of these cutting operations; and have virtually discarded them. It is rarely that a satisfactory incision Fig. 1085. can be made in a single movement. Furthermore, the hemorrhage produced, slight though it may be, produces cough, and usually obscures the field to an extent that prevents further manipulation at the time. The opinion that injury may result from forcible inspiration of the portions of growth detached, is to some extent justifiable, although the fragments are usually ejected by coughing. Excision of fragments, by the cutting blades of forceps of the same shapes as are used in evulsion, is requisite in cases of large growth, and is usually a satisfactory procedure. The portions excised are removed in the grasp of the instrument. As the capacity of this is limited, a number of excisions are uecessaiy, usually requiring several sittings, should the field Fig. 1088. Stoerk’s universal handle, with two forms of guillotine. become at all obscured by blood. The hemorrhage in all these procedures is rarely of much significance. Dr. Edward Lori removes laryngeal growths with catheter-poly|)otomes—metallic catheters with eye-holes at various positions around their distal extremities, the edges being sharpened so as to cut througli any soft morbid growths which may be caught in them.

DISEASES OF THE BREAST. 844 It will be seen by these statistics, that cancer of the breast is rare before 30. It lias been met with at the age of 28 in several instances, and I have myself met with one case of scirrlms at this age. Henry, quoted by G-ross, records a case at 21. Mr. Sibley records as the earliest age, 26, and as the latest, 84. I have met with and operated upon 2 patients at 84 years of age ; and Mr. Bryant refers to a case of one year’s standing in a patient 96 j’ears of age; but the disease is not common after 70. [The Editor saw some years since, with Dr. Albert II. Smith, of Philadelphia, a case of atrophic scirrhus in the breast of a patient aged 89.] In regard to the efiect of marriage, lactation, and other conditions con- nected with the generative functions, on production of cancer of the breast, it would appear that the disease is more common in the married, and in those having children. Of 160 patients referred to by Aunn, 22 were single, and had no children ; 138 were married, of whom 51 were sterile, and 87 had children, having on an average, 5.5 children. Baker^ gives a table of 260 cases of cancer of the breast, in which there were of;— Single women ....... 23.0 per cent Married women ....... 72.4 “ Widows ......... 4.G “ Gross notes that of 688 women, 607, or 88.22 per cent., were, or had been, married, and 81, or 11.77 per cent, were single. Of 435 Avomen, 365, or 83.91 per cent., had borne children; and of these nearly nine-tenths had had more tlian one child, while 70, or 16.09 per cent., Avere barren. In regard to the influence of menstruation, Paget gives a table of 400 cases as folloAvs:— Ages. Cessation of Menstruation. First observation of the Cancer. Below 35 9 . 3G 35 to 40 51 . G2 40 to 45 . 140 . 78 45 to 50 159 . 101 Above 50 41 . 123 It Avould serve no practical use, in the present state of our knowledge, to discuss liere the caiisation of cancer, but it is enough to consider that the female lireast is one of the organs in the body which appears to be faA^orable for the development of this disease, and that prolonged local irritation or injury, in not a few cases, acts as an excitant of its development. Paget found that out of 91 patients only 16 ascribed the cancer to injury or any such local cause. Dr. Gross states that in 23 out of 270 cases analyzed by Wini- Avarter and himself, the disease AA'as ascribable to traumatism-—such as blows and contusions, and that in 5 of 370 cases collected by Oldekop and himself, it Avas preceded by eczema or psoriasis of the nipple, Avhile it started from lumps or chronic indurations left b}" puerperal mastitis in 30, or 8.21 per cent, of the 365 Avomen Ayho had borne children. The association of eczema of the nipple and of the skin around it Avith the production of cancer of the breast, has been brought under notice by Sir James Paget,^ Mr. Butlin,^ l\lr. Henry ^torris,^ Dr. Thin,® and others. From a consideration of the recorded eases of this condition, it Avould appear that in some instances there has been a history of from five to six years’ local irritation before the development of the cancer, Avhile in other cases the cancer has been developed Avithin tAvo years from the 1 Med.-Cliir.

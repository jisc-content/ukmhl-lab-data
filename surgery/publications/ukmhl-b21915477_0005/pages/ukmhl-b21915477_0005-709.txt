(EDEMA OF THE LARYNX. 649 Etiology.—Very rarely, indeed, is acute cedema of the larynx a primary, idiopathic affection. Sestier* noted 36 cases out of 190. It has been known, however, to follow so closely upon exposure to cold and rain, deglutition of very cold drinks,^ and prolonged vocal effort, as to seem primary ; but acute or subacute inffammatory laryngitis may have preceded. It may follow trau- matism (piite as promptly, for Ziemsseff has reported a case, in a man who was smoking, of death within a few minutes after penetration of the wall of the laryngeal ventricle by a piece of rib of tobacco-leaf. It often occurs in the trau- matic laryngitis from deglutition of hot and caustic solutions, from burns, or from the presence of foreign bodies. It is quite frequent in wounds of tlie larynx. It may occur in gunshot wounds of the neck, even when the larynx is not implicated. Thus, fatal oedema is reported on the fourth day after such a wound from a inch grape-shot, which entered near the right horn of the hyoid bone, passed obliquely across the neck, and lodged in the subscapular fossa, whence it was removed by incision.^ It sometimes occurs in sore throat. Roger® relates an instance of sudden death in a slight case of sore throat in a hospital servant. Trousseau mentions a case saved by tracheotomy, in which it occurred from sleeping in the open air after an evening’s debauch f and Laverau, a case fatal within fffteen minutes, in a soldier, a day after suspen- sion of treatment for sore throat.^ Simple inffammation was regarded as the cause in more than six per cent, of Sestier’s cases. In such instances, Mackenzie® believes the cedema to be nearly always due to blood-poisoning. Q^ldema of the larynx has been noted in aneurism,® obstruction of the hepatic duct,’® erysipelas,” ecthyma,’® scarlatina,'® measles,’^ smallpox, facial erysi[)elas (by myself), typhus and enteric fever,'® glanders, nephritis,'® whoop- ing cough,'^ capillary bronchitis, }>neumonia, croup, diphtheria, and maras- mus.’® It is chiefly in the waning stages of these affections, or during con- valescence therefrom, that the oedema takes place, probably in consecpience of lack of protection fi’om drafts of air. It is a rare accompaniment of general anasarca, probably because there is no sore throat or laryngitis to start it.'® It occurs occasionally in acute iodism®" and in mercurialization. It is therefore prudent to supervise patients with laryngeal disease to whom, for the first time, mercury and iodine are being administered in decided doses. Phleg- monous glossitis, and diffuse inflammation of the connective tissue of the neck, sometimes give rise to cedema of the larynx. Icy contiguity. Mackenzie®’ attributes mdema of the larynx largely to septicaemia, having met with the affection in hospital physicians, medical students, ancl nurses, ' Op. cit. 2 Albers, cited in my work already quoted (Diseases of the Throat, etc., p. 477). ® Cyclop:edia of Practical Medicine, vol. vii. p. 794. ■* Med. and Siirg.

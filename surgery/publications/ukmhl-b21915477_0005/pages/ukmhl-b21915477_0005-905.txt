MALIGNANT TUMORS. 845 1 See Plate XXIII., Vol. IV., page G34, supra. first a]ipearance of the eczema. Iii one case reported by Mr. IMonds, the local irritation amonnted to ulceration. In some of the reported cases there has been a distinct portion of healthy tissue between the affected skin and the cancer in the gland, but in others the two conditions have been continuous. These cases have been met with at the ages of 33, 40, and 60 years, and at periods between those ages.^ Hereditary tendency also influences, but not to a great extent, the develop- ment of cancer in the breast. According to Hunn, in 160 cases, cancer had been treated among the relations in 47 cases, or 29.3 per cent. Of 389 cases (pioted by Gross, 40, or 1 in every 9.72, stated that cancer had occurred in some of their ancestors. The hereditary history of phthisis has also been thought to influence tlie occurrence of cancer; hTunn mentions that out of 160 cases, phthisis was traced among relatives in 36. Sibley found 48 instances of the occurrence of phthisis in l30 cases. Mr. Huiin has pointed out an interesting fact in connection with the lon- gevity of the families of patients suffering from cancer of the breast. In 169 cases observed by him, the average age of the fathers was 62.25, the average of the mothers 61.53 ; 106 patients had grandparents who had lived to be more than 70 years old ; 62 had parents who had lived to be more than 80 years old ; 15 had grandparents known to have lived over 90 years. It has also been observed that the majority of patients are in good health when the cancer first develops itself. Paget found that in 91 cases no less than 66 presented the characters of robust, or at least good, health, 9 were of uncertain or moderately good health, and only 16 were sickly or feelfle. Baker also observed that only 5.2 per cent, of patients suffering from scirrlius of the breast were in bad health when the disease was first observed. Gross says that out of 189 patients, in whom the general condition is men- tioned, 97, or 51 per cent., were in robust health, 34, or 18 per cent., were in good health, 37, or 19 per cent., were pale and tliin, and 21, or 11 per cent., were decidedly broken down from the effects of the disease. The jyrogress and duration of cancer of the breast^ if uuinterfered with by operation, vary considerably in different cases, and also vary in the two forms of the disease. According to Paget, the average duration of scirrlius is a little more than four years, while in an encephaloid cancer it is rather more than two years.

Cases of cancer of the breast have been known to run a rapid course of a few weeks or months, but, on the other hand, some varieties of scirrlius will exist for several years; cases have been recorded of 10,15, and 20 years’ duration, without the disease progressing. AV^hen the disease occurs during pregnancy or lactation it sometimes runs a very rapid course. 1 once operated upon a mother and daughter for scirrlius

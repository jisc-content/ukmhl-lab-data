HARELIP. 467 Fig. 938. Fig. 939. Malgaigneâ€™s operation for harelip. the small flap dissected from the margin is made to overlap the lower margin of the narrower side. (Figs. 940 and 941.) Fig. 940. Fig. 941. Operation fur harelip with marked inequality ol sides. When the fissure is very wide, and when the lateral portions of the lip cannot otherwise be approximated witliout undue tension, incisions may be made outwards into the cheeks from the junction of the lip with the nose, and, if necessary, from the angles of the mouth. In cases of double harelip, not complicated with deformity of tlie jaw, if the portion of the lip intermediate between the two fissures is of considerable breadth, and extends nearly or quite down to the level of the free borders of the lateral portions, the operation may first be performed on one side, and after the wound has healed, and when the union has liecome firmly consolidated, may be repeated on the other. But when the intermediate portion is of smaller dimensions, the operation on both sides may be completed at the same time.

Fig. 992. Fig- 993. Operation for fissure of upper lip. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 994 exhibits a case of destruction of the upper lip throughout its whole extent. Lateral flaps, of the full breadth of the lip, are cut on each side; their outer extremities are curved downwards so as to relieve them from tension; and their inner extremities are then drawn together in the median line, as shown in Fig. 995. Figs. 994 and 995 are altered from Szymanowskiâ€™s drawings by curving the peduncles of the flaps. This change in the form of the flaps is a matter of great importance in relieving tension, and in securing primary union with a minimum of deformity. Fig. 994. Fig. 095. Restoration of upper lip. (Modified from Szymanowski.) Fig. 996 exhibits a cleft of the upper li}>, extending from the angles of the mouth to a point in the median line, one third of tlie distance from the nose to the incisor teeth. A transverse incision is made above the upper extremity

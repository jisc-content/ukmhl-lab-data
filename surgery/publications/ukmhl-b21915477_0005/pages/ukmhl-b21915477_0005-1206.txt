1142 HERNIA. Fig. 113C. liqiie wliicli covers it. Its point will then be seen to raise the skin. The skin must next be drawn towards the median line, and the needle directed by its stout handle so as to bring its point out through the skin, one inch and a half external to the puncture, through the deeper tissues (Fig. 1134). One end of the Avire is then hooked on to the eye of the needle, and is draAvn with it by a slight jerk through the tissues emerging at the scrotal puncture. (Fig. 1135.) The needle is next detached from the Avire, and the linger again passed into the canal. FToav the spermatic cord is to be felt for, lying in a groove formed by the union of Poupart’s liga- ment Avith the fascia transversalis. The cord is to be pushed gently imvards, and the })oint of the finger placed in the groove Avhich it occupied, and lifted foi'Avards, so as to eleA^ate Poupart’s ligament at its centre, and Avith it the outer pillar of the superficial ring. The iliac artery may be sometimes felt behind the finger, which lifts up the tendinous structure from its immediate contiguity, and protects the vessels from injury. The needle, passed again along the front of the finger, a little to its outer side, is then pushed through Poupart’s ligament till its point raises the skin. (Fig. 113G.) The latter is noAv pulled imvards until the point of the needle can lie made to pass through the same puncture in the skin of the groin Avhich the Avire already traverses. The opposite end of the wire is next The needle penetrating Poupart’s ligament. Fig. 1137.

There is noAV a Avire-loop at the groin, and tAvo hook-ends at the scrotal puncture. Opposite the latter, the sac is then pinched up by the fino-er and thumb, in the same AA’ay that a AUiricocele is separated from the spermatic duct Avhen submitted to operation.

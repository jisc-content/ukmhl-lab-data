BURNS OF THE LIPS AND CHEEKS—FROSTBITE. 4(31 was dissected upward, and tiie two lower flaps were turned, one inward toward the nose, and the other outward over the malar hone. The ante- rior surface of the superior maxillary bone, and the lower margin of the orbit, were thus exposed to view. The crown of a trephine, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, was then applied to the anterior wall of the antrum, just below the infra-orbital foramen, and a disk of bone was removed, exposing the cavity. The anterior portion of the trunk of the nerve was now exposed. The infra-orbital canal was next laid open with a delicate chisel and a hammer, and the posterior wall of the antrum dealt with in like manner, exposing the nerve in the spheno-maxillary fossa. Tlie posterior dental nerves were divided, as also the branches going to Meckel's ganglion, and the branch running up to the orbit. Lastly, the trunk of the nerve was divided with blunt-}»ointed scissors, curved on the flat, close to the foramen rotuiidum. The hemorrhage was not pi’ofuse, and the edges of the wound were Ijrought together with thirteen points of twisted suture. Fourteen months after the operation the patient was in good health, and Avas entirely free from neuralgic pain. Dr. Carnochan reported two other cases in which he had performed the same operation with results which Avere good, although a sufficiently long time had not elapsed to test the permanence of the cure." Dr. Carnochan’s operation has been repeated by a number of surgeons, Avith variable success. The operations of neurotomy and neurectomy haAm also been performed Avith more or less success on the ophthalmic and inferior dental branches of the flfth pair of nerves.^ As a substitute for neurectomy, the operation of nerve-stretching has been resorted to Avith some measure of success in the treatment of facial neuralgia, as Avell as in that of other nervous disorders.^ Burns of the Lips and Cheeks. These injuries are of frequent occurrence. They are A^ery painful, and greatly interfere Avith the prehension ol food. When they are deep, they are very apt to be followed by cicatricial contractions, Avhich distort the features and greatly disflgure the patient. Special care is required to guard against such distortions. When the face is burned by the explosion of gunpoAvder, the grains of poAvder are often deeply imbedded in the skin; they should be carefully removed, one by one, Avhile the patient is under the influence of an amesthetic. Frostbite. The lips and cheeks maybe injured l)y exposure to seAmre cold, and ulcera- tion, or sloughing, may be the result.

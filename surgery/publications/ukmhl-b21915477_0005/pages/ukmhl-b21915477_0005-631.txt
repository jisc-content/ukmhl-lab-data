571 MECHANICAL TREATMENT OF LESIONS OF THE PALATE. more fixed and incurable the older one grows, even with normal organs, it is more encouraging to begin at the earliest age practicable. But little will be gained, however, by introducing such apparatus into the mouths of mere children, before they are of an age to realize its importance and to cooperate with the efforts made in their behalf. As a general rule, it is cpiite as well to await the eruption of the twelfth-year-old molars, after which period there is but very slight enlargement of the jaws, or increase in the size of the fissure. Acquired lesions of the palate are corrected by mechanism far more readily and with much greater certainty than are the congenital. The effect upon speech of any perforation of the palate which permits abnormal escape of sound to the nasal cavity, is disastrous, but the remedy comes instan- taneously when the proper apparatus is introduced. Appliances for con- genital cleft tax the utmost ingenuity of the maker, but the rccpiirements for acquired lesions may be of very simple character. Anything which can be worn over or in the orifice, which will interrupt the passage, will restore the faculty of speech; so that the instrument may be made of any of the materials used as a base for artificial teeth, and requires to be but a cover or stopper to the opening, nicely adjusted, and secured generally to some adjacent teeth. In all lesions of either the hard or soft palate which are of moderate extent, and which do not reach to the posterior border of tlie velum, it is unwise to permit an obturator to pass into the opening, thus preventing the diminution of the orifice and its possible final closure. Small openings will sometimes completely close, with no other treatment than covering the orifice.

152 MALFORMATIONS AND DISEASES OF THE HEAD. the substance of the hone ; ultimately, perhaps, penetrates the inner cranial plate; and extends then between the bone and the dura mater. The sarcoma generally spreads evenly over the dura mater, forming a flattened rather than a rounded elevation of that membrane towards the cranial cavity. In time, also, the dura mater itself may become invaded by the growth. In the diploic form, a very similar course is observed. The mass commences in the diploe, and slowly separates and expands the cranial plates. The growth naturally tends towards the external surface as the direction of least resistance. The outer table becomes expanded and thinned, until it forms a mere cap of bone over the now fair-sized swelling. In time this bony cap gives way, and the growth appears immediately beneath the soft tissues of the pericranium and seal}). Some dis})lacement and expansion of the inner skull-}ilate may be observed, hut it is not common in any hut a trifling degree. Sarcomata of the cranium may he }irimary or secondary. Most often they are secondaiy to like tumors elsewhere. They are usually mnltijile, seldom affect the corrcs}ionding glands, and, when primaiy, are very a|)t to lead to metastases in various }iarts. They are most common in youth and middle life. Some few cases are recorded in quite young children,’ and ]\Ir. Birkett^ has described a case of myeloid sarcoma of the frontal hone in an infant aged two months. The }iatient lived nine months after the ap])earance of the growth. Mr. Butliid observes that these sarcomata in young children are usu- ally of the round-celled variety, that they are nearly always multiple, and tliat they kill by metastatic formations. j\Iicrosco}:)ically, these tumors are usually of the s})indle-celled variety, es}ie- cially such as grow beneath the })ericranium. The more rapidly growing tumors are, as a rule, examples of round-celled sarcoma, and in any variety a certain }n’0}iortion of myeloid cells is usually to be found. Symptoms, etc.—These growths first a}>})ear as small, flat, rounded masses, which are dee})ly }ilaced and very fixed. Their a})})earance may be })receded by headache and local })ain, and these sym})toms are more a})t to occur in con- nection with tumors growing from the diploe. These growths are at first of bony hardness, and may well be mistaken for exostoses. In the case of the diploic tumor, the covering of the growth is actually of bone ; in the case of the more siqierficial growths, there is a covering of tense })ericranium. The mass enlarges rapidly, and becomes softer; if it has expanded the hone, egg- shell crackling will he detected at some period. At last, a roundish, tuberous tumor is develojied, that feels soft, and })erhaps in places almost fluctuating. The skin becomes gradually thinned over the mass, the hair falls off, and in time the sarcomatous material }irotrudes through the integuments. Often around the edge of the tumor, at its base, a raised rim of hone can be detected, and perhaps })ortions of the long traheculie may be felt in the substance of the mass. The growths, as already observed, are a})t to he multiple, and to be associated with metastatic dejiosits. They may attain great size, especially if the^^ occur in }iarts where facilities are offered for extension. Mr. Toynbee^ records the case of a female, aged nineteen, from whose occi}jital bone grew a mass that in three years’ time occu})ied the greater part of the neck on one side. It would a})})ear from the accounts given to have been a s}:)indle-celled sarcoma. ISlr. Stanley® also records a case in ivliich an enormous tumor de- velo}ied from the vertex in a lad, aged fifteen. It looked like “an additional cranium growing from the vault of the skull.” The }iatient died with brain symptoms three years from the first a}ipearance of the disease.

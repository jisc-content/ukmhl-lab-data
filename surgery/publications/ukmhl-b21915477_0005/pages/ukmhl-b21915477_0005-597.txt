537 TUMORS OF THE JAWS. Dnpuytren, at Paris, but when removed by section of the healthy bone beyond, shows no tendency to reproduction. The ivory osteoma I have met with both as an outgrowth from the lower jaw of a healthy woman, and as a tumor of the upper jaw' of wdiich the ivory w'as but a portion, the rest being composed of dense cancellous bone. Some very remarkable cases of osteoma Avhicli are on record, are doubtless examples of ossitied enchondroma. In these cases the tumor has a tendency to become loosened from its attachment to the surrounding parts, and either to drop aAvay, as in Mr. Hilton’s case, or to be readily removed, as in Dr. Duka’s. In the treatment of these tumors, an exploratory puncture, or trephining, may enable the tooth wdiich is the cause of the malady to be extracted, and hence this should never be neglected except in the case of the ivory growdh. This again may be saw'ed otf, shoAving no tendency to recur, or it may be extracted from the cavity of the antrum, or from the inteidor of the loAver jaAV. As a last resource the upper jaAv, or a portion of the loAver, may be removed Avith the tumor, but extensive mutilations should not be undertaken for benign and sloAvly increasing tumors if they can be avoided. PuLSATiNO TUMORS of the Upper jaAV have been occasionally met witb, and are mostly examples of vascular sarcoma. In the Museum of University College, London, is a specimen of true erectile tumor of the upper jaAV and pterygo-maxillary fossa, removed in 1841 by iMr. Liston from a man aged twenty-one, Avho had suffered from frequent hemorrhages from the groAvth. The tumor is everyAvhere bounded by a dense layer of librous tissue, but “ on section the divided surface has a uniformly oi)en, caA'ernous structure, like that of the corpus cavernosum })cnis, tbe meshes of Avhich are noAvhere occupied by a solid substance, and probably alloAved of the circulation of blood through them.” Cystic Sarcoma.—Under the old term “ cystic sarcoma,” Avere included probably more than one A'ariety of solid groAvth in Avhich cysts Avere developed. The presence of cysts Avas held to mark the non-malignant character of the disease, and the clinical histories of the recorded cases ap})cared to support this vieAV. The nakeil-eye appearance of the solid growTh Avas that of a filu’ous or fibro-cellular tumor, and this Avas considered to be its natin-e until Avithin a few years. lu 1871, Mr. Wagstaffe* described a tumor of this kind as consisting of a peculiar arrangement of Avhat ap})eared to be acini or cylinders of closely-})acked cells, supported by a fibro-nuclcated matrix. In the same year, I removed a large cystic sarcoma involving the right side of the loAver jaAv, Avhich presented many of the appearances described by Mr. M^agstalfe, and led Mr. Deck to describe the tumor, in the Catalogue of tlie Museum of Uni\'ersity College, as a peculiar, “gland-like tumor of bone,” affecting only the loAA'er jaAV. One-half of this tumor Inwing been presented to the Royal College of ISurgeons, has recently undergone fresh examination by Mr. Eve, the curator, Avho from his investigations upon it and other similar tumors, has come to the conclusion that they originate in an ingroAvth from tlie epithelium of the gum, and should bo classed among the epitheliomata. He Avould attrilnite tbe development of cysts to degeneration of the epithe- lial cells, and the a[»parent immunity from recurrence to the fact that these tumors are more or less completely encased in a shell of I)one. I Avas liardly prepared to acce})t this vicAv in its clinical aspects, Avlien, early in 1882, the patient from Avhom, in 1871, I had removed nearly the Avliole of the right side of the loAver jaAV for “ cystic sarcoma,” rea|»peared Avith a large ulcer of I’atliological Trausactious, vol. xxii.

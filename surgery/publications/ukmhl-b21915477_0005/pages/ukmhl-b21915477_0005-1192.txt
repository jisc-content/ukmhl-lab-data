HERNIA. 1128 be seen the outer border of the rectus abdoininis muscle, lying behind the aponeurotic sbeatli derived from tlie conjoined tendons of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, blended here, also, to a considerable extent, with the tendinous fibres of the external oblique muscles. Some fibres reach across the linea alba, from the opposite side, are placed obliquely across the lower part of the superficial ring-, and are attached to the crest of the pubis as far as the pubic spine, fortifying at this place the hinder wall of the inguinal canal. These are known as the triangular fascia. (See Fig. 1127 g.) On turning aside the oblique aponeurosis (a), the lower muscular fibres of origin of the internal oblique {b) are seen arising fi-orn Poupart’s ligament as far down as the inner third, covering and fortifying the upper part of the front wall of the inguinal canal and the deep ring (/). The muscular fibres of origin are continued along the lower third of Pou- part’s ligament as the cremaster muscle^ the scattered fibres of which, con- nected by the cremasteric fascia, pass through the superficial ring—some, the Fig. 1127. Deep dissection of the inguinal canal and abdominal wall. outer ones, to be lost on the tunica vaginalis testis; the middle ones passing up so as to form loops, to become inserted into tlie fascia near the superficial ring ; while some ytass again into the ring to become implanted upon the con- joined tendon and triangular fascia. Thus is constituted in the perfect specimen the cremastericyasda, recognizable to the surgeon by its muscular fibres, but very frequently feeble and indistinct in cases of congenital hernia. On dividino- longitudinally the fibres of the internal oblique, it will be seen that they are deeply more or less blended wdth those of the transversalis

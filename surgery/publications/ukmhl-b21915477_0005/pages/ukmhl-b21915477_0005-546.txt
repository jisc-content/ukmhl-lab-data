486 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FACE, CHEEKS, AND LIPS. to be joined together in the median line, as represented in Fig. 979, leaving on each side a narrow eliasm to be filled by granulation. Fig. 980 exhibits a difierent mode of forming flaps to close a triangular chasm extending from the free border of the lower lip to the chin. The flaps as seen in the diagram are curved, and terminate above at acute angles, so that when the flaps are brought together in the median line, the integument above their apices can be readily united by sutures without puckering. In many cases, flaps constructed in this way will close the chasm with less disfigurement than when any other method is employed. Fig. 981 exhibits the appearance of the parts when the flaps are adjusted and secured by sutures. Fig. 980. Fig. 981. Rescoration of lower lip by another method. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 982. Fig. 983. Another method of restoring the lower lip. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 982 represents another mode of closing the chasm by lateral flaps on each side, with their bases above towards the cheeks, and their free extremities below. These flaps, as represented in Fig. 983, are turned edgewise so that their free extremities meet in the median line, and the lower part of the chasm is filled by other flaps dissected from the subjacent parts.

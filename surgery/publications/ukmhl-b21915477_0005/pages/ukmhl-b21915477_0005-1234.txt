HERXIA. 1170 ends of the wires being drawn upon luitil the middle portions have sunk through the punctures in the hernial coats. The ends are then to be twisted down into the side puncture by two twists, and brought over so as to hook into the loop. If a common suture-needle be used, two Avires must be em- Fig. 1151.

A firm pad of lint, bent so as to lit over the projecting and crum})led-up sac, is now placed under the bridge of Avire (see Fig. 1154); a padding of lint is put at the sides, and a light bandage is applied around the body to keep all steady. The Avires may Fig. 1153. Fig. 11.54. The ring closed by trcisting the rrire.

An elastic liody-belt, and a flat, hard, circular pad, of three inches in diameter, placed in a pocket of the belt in front, should be Avorn for six or tAvelve months to support the union. I have performed this operation in six eases of hernia in children, Avhich had baffled all contrivances for truss-pressure. In one case, a lad, F. M., aged 14, the liernia was about the size of a Avalnut, and the patient liad been refused admission to the navy in consequence. He Avas operated on Avitli wires, December G, 18G7 ; and in the year following the cicatrix Avas found, on examination, to be hard, firm, and resisting, Avith no cough-impulse Avhatever, and Avith much retraction of the navel. In none of the cases Avere any serious symptoms observed, and none of the ruptures are reported as having returned, although the patientâ€™s friends Avere earnestly requested to inform me if any recurrence should take place.

HERNIA. iiao the spermatic and pudic arteries. It arises from the external iliac, just above the crural and below the dee}) inguinal 0})ening. It is subject to some irregu- larities which will be mentioned in relation to crural hernia. Crossing the })Osterior inguinal wall, u}iwards and inwards to the navel (see Fig. 1128 d), internal to this, and lying behind the border of the conjoined tendon, is the oljliterated hyjjogastrie co7-d, the remains of the foetal placental artery. It gives olf before its })oint of obliteration the superior vesical artery to the Idaolder. Internal to it }>asses out an inguinal ru})ture, when it assumes the direct form, emerging between this obliterated artery and the outer edge of the rectus muscle, ^\diich form the two sides of the triangle of Ilesselbach, the base being formed by the inner end of Foupart’s ligament. The perito- neal investment behintl this is loose and movable, and a direct rn})ture either }:)asses through, or is coveretl by, a pi’olongation of the conjoined tendon, which is })laced here, tilling u}i the triangle. (See Fig. 1127.) The inguinal canal is thus an oblique, valvvdar ojiening, in the layers of the muscles and fascia }jlaced above the inner half of Pou})art’s ligament, its anterior wall being conqiosed of the integuments, a})oneui’osis of the external ol)liqne, intercolumnar tibres, lower fibres of internal ol»lique, and cremasteric muscle. It is from one to two inches long, and half an inch wide—wider in the male than the female, but longer in the female. The spermatic cord, consisting of the vas deferens, with its artery, and the y}>ermatic vessels and nerves, loosely connected together by an areolar invest- ment, traverses the oblique inguinal canal in a direction more directly u}>wards than that of the canal itself. Thus it is se}xirated above from Pou})art’s liga- ment by an interval of from half to three-quarters of an inch, where a groove can l)e felt with the finger, formed by the junction of the fascia transversalis with the dee}) surface of the ligament. This groove it is important to recognize in o})erating for the radical cure of the oblique kind of hernia. At the lower end of the canal, at the superficial ring, the cord crosses obliquely the inser- tion of I’ou}jart's ligament, grooving it dee})ly just outside the })ubic s})ine, which thus acquires an im})ortant internal relation to the cord. Lying u})on the cord, under cover of the cremaster muscle and its fascia, is the genital branch of the anterior crural nerve, sending off its filaments to the loops of the cremastei’ muscle, and, finally emerging from the su})erficial ring to su}> })ly the dartos scroti, and so communicate with the perineal branches of the internal })udic nerve. Coverings op Inguinal Hernia.—An oblique or exte^mal hernia (so-called because it }iasses outside of the e})igastric artery), traverses the dee}) ring and inguinal canal, and is covered b}’ the structures forming the anterior wall of the canal, viz., the integuments, the aponeurosis of the external oblique, with its arciforrn or intercolumnar fibres (fascia s})ermatiea externa), by the lower fibres of the internal obli(}ue and the cremasteric fibres and fascia, and by the infundibular })rolongation of the fascia transversalis or fascia pro}‘)ria. Then comes the })eritoneal sac, covered I)y adi}')Ose tissue se})arating the contents of the ]’U})ture from the constituents of the cord and their investing areolar tissue. The hernia lies on the hinder wall of the canal, this consisting of the triangular fascia, the conjoined tendon, and the fascia transversalis, covering the e})igastric vessels and hy})ogastric cord. A direct or internal hernia is wanting in the covering of the infundibuliform fascia, and may have an investing layer from the conjoined tendon and fascia transversalis, and sometimes from the cremasteric fascia. In a case of inguinal hernia of long standing, and originally and essentially ail oblique or external hernia, where the neck of the sac is wide and large, the e})igastric vessels may be dragged inwards by the weight and traction of

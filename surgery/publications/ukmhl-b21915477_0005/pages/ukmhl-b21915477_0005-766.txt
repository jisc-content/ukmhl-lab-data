TOG INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE AIR-PASSAGES. It is neither to he regarded as a routine procedure nor as a last resort. It is a legitimate therapeutic measure, with a definite purpo.se. The special indication cannot be formulated by an infiexible rule. The good judgment of the surgeon must be his guide. The most favorable moment for inter- ference, is when the surgeon begins to think that the patient cannot live without it; but recovery follows occasionally, even when the operation has been postponed until immediately after apparent death. Comparatively few children under two years of age are saved, not many over eight or nine, and adults only as the exception. The adult larynx is so large that it rarely becomes at all occluded in diphtlieria, until such a late date that fatal blood-poisoning has occurred in the normal progress of the disease. That operations are by no means hopeless at the earlier age referred to, the following record, amended from my own essay,' will abundantly testify. Thus successes are reported at six weeks by Scoutetten; at three months by Annan- dale;^ at five months by Croft at six months by Kisler;' at seven months by Bell, Tait, and at Langenbeck’s clinic;® at eight months by Elias;® at nine months by Steinmayer at ten months by Baizeau, Bujardin, Bourdillat, Foster, Greenfield,® Elias, and Winiwarter; at 11 months by Shrady,® and in a case operated upon at the Boston City Hospitalat 13 months by Trousseau, Barthez, and Archambault; at 14 months by Millard and Henry;" at 15 months by Baizeau and a colleague of his; at 16 months by Isambert and Potain; at 17 months by von Vigla and Jacobson;'® at 18 months by Moutard-Martin, Potain, and Archambault; at 10 months by Pancoast; at 21 months by Sendler, Waren Tay,'® and Mayer;" at 22 months by Labord, Isambert, and Parker;’® and at 23 months by Labord and Malshieurat-Le- grand. On the other hand, I have been unable to find more than three successes recorded in adults; 1 by Quain;'® 1 by Lloyd,'^ and 1 by Hussbaum.'® The successful completion of the operation does not terminate the surgeon’s responsibility. He must protect his patient from sufibcation, which is liable to ensue by occlusion of the artificial ojicning just made. First of all, he must search the air-passages for pseudo-membrane, just as he would, were they ob- structed by any other foreign body. Tlie edges of the incision being held apart, by hooks, ligatures, or simple or special retractors—of which the retractor de- vised by Mr. G olding-Bird (Fig. 1042, p. G76) is probably the best—forceps are to be introduced, to search for false membrane and extract it. For obvious reasons the first search is made below the wound, and the laiynx is explored afterwards. Suction at the wound with the mouth, is probably the most efficacious method of withdrawing fragments of pseudo-membrane, but it is not safe. Infection and death therefrom may follow. More than one sur- geon has sacrificed his life in this manner, and has failed to save his patient. 1 Op. cit., p. 24. 2 The child lived seven weeks. Edinburgh Medical Journal, p.

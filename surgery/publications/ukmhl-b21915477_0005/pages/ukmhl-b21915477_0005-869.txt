809 WOUNDS OF THE CHEST. sidering the treatment of a bleeding intercostal or mammary vessel, it must be borne in mind that secondary beniorrbage lias more often proved trouble- some or fatal in wounds implicating these vessels, than primary bleeding, and that so a greater difficulty has been found in practice, in their ease, than would be anticipated from the contemplation of their anatomical relations in the healthy condition. This observation applies to the surgery of all regions, hut the difficulties presented by the position of these vessels within the bony cage of the thorax, and by their immediate relation to the cavities of the pleura and pericardium, to which the styptics applicable in corresponding hemorrhages iu the limbs are ill suited, require for tlieir treatment a high ilegree of skill and decision. It so happens that special methods for the management of these cases have been devised in extraordinary number, and perhaps each with merits which may recommend its ado}»tion iu some particular emergency. While the wounds which furnish either Y'l’iniary or secondary hemorrhage from these vessels, are at all times, even iu wartare, rare, sufficient reason has been shown why, when they occur, the life of the sufferer is often to a great extent placed solely in the hands of the surgeon. In these circumstances, I cannot help approving the just criticism of the editor of the Surgical History of the American War, on Guthrie and even Boyer, who, each, ado[>ting whatever of these methods suited him or first suggested itself, sneers at all others, at least at all but his own, each think- ing his own alone worth notice. It will at once a|/pear to the practical surgeon that the diagnosis of the source of bleeding is more easily made in these cases under the conditions of secondary, than in those of primary hemorrhage, for bleeding from the wounded lung, though possible as a secondary event, is less likely than that attending the separation of sloughs of tissues directly related to broken bone, either sternum or rib. There- fore, although the identification of the source of bleeding has appeared iu most cases to have been readily made, the prominent feature of the recorded cases is the difficulty of efficiently controlling the bleeding vessel, in conse- quence of its altered surroundings, and of the liability of the tissues, softened by disease, to separate too readily under })ressure of the ligature or other means adopted. The methods of control are the direct ligature, by tena- culum or forceps, or torsion of the vessel (Guthrie); the including of rib and vessel, and a compress applied over the vessel, with the skin, by a needle carried around all (Girard); the more skilled application with a blunt needle, curved so as to pass around the rib, push asi(le the jileura, and be callable of introduction from the wound without injury of the skin (Goulard)—the blunt needle of the chain-saw may be used (Howard); complete section of the vessel, as in arteriotomy, with a compress (Assalini); digital pressure main- tained by successive hands (Ghelius); a compress secured Avitli a thread, passed within the thorax and turned half ai’ound, to prevent its escape, and tied against an external support, as in plugging the nose; most generally apjiroved of, yet it would seem but seldom tried, the compress of Desault—a^ piece of linen pushed within the wound while its edges are maintained without, and the recess so formed tilled with padding, so that when the inclosing linen is drawn tight, the contents shall be drawn firmly against the circumference of the wound, pressing thus from within against it ; and steel and ivory clijis for conq>ressif)n of the rib an<I vessel, instruments probaldy efficient though cumbersome, and certainly unlikely to be at hand in the excejitional emer- gency of these hemorrhages. Finally, the intercostal might be tied at a ]ioint on the ju-oximal side of the wound, in order to allow this to remain open and free from compresses. A smaller number of plans have been pro- posed for securing the i.nternal laamiiinj'i/ vessel, and various methods of in- cision have been suggested to ex[)ose the artery on the })roximal side of the

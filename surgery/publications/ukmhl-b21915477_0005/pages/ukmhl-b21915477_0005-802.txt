INJUKIES AKD DISEASES OF THE AIR-PASSAGES. 742 is tlireatening, traciieotomy is indicated, and siionld be performed at as great a distance below tlie disease as practicable. ]Jyspbagia necessitates the use of semi-tinid or fluid nonrisbment. "Wlien apliagia is tbreatenins,-, rectal alimentation should be resorted to in advance of its absolute necessity. Dysphagia due to an enlarged and ulcerated epiglottis may be overcome by ablation of that organ, a procedure which in my own practice lias been followed with no unpleasant results, and has attbrded considerable comfort. In disease limited to the epiglottis, excision of that structure after sub-byoi- dean incision externally, is indicated as a radical measure. The question as to the proprieD' of laryngectomy bids fair to be duly answered in the near future. Xearly eighty complete extirpations of the larynx are known to have been performed for carcinoma. The ultimate re- sults, as far as can be ascertained, are herewith presented:— From all sources, published and unpublished, I am able to present the following :— RECORD OF DEATHS REPORTED AFTER COMPLETE LARYNGECTOMY FOR CARCINOMA, Operator.

287 OPHTHALMOSCOPIC DISEASES. of extreme suffering come at last. In this stage, Fig- 88i- the diagnosis is usually easy. Still, in adults, the case may be mistaken for simple glaucoma, till later developments. ISTow and then, I have seen a sarcomatous tumor developing in the ciliary region, mistaken for cataract or for a luxated lens. A very little skill will prevent such a blunder. The annexed wood-cut (Fig. 881) represents the sec- tion of an eye removed from a lady 39 years of age, who, about six months before coming under observation, acci- dentally discovered that her right eye was very imper- fect. She could barely see objects around the room. The eye up to that time had never been painful, and had never been injured, but since then the eye had become entirely blind, and was now at times quite painful. The eye was abnormally hard. The iris was pressed forward, in confact with the cornea, and it was impossible to obtain more than a red reflex from the fundus, and that only on the inner side. On the outer side was seen the rounded out- line of a choroidal tumor. The eye was enucleated December 9, 1881, and after hardening in Mullerâ€™s fluid was opened by vertical section. The tumor was found attached outwardly, and was 18 mm. in length and 8 mm. in thickness. The retina was detached and funnel-shaped. Section of eyeball showing an intra- ocular tumor.

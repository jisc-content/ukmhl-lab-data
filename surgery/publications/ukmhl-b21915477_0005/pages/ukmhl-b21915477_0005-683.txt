G23 AFFECTIONS OF THE SUBMAXILLARY GLAND. ami sympathetic nerves, and so causing, with other signs, dilatation of the pupil. The Avindpipe and cesophagus have also been pressed upon by these tumors. Carcinoma is rare as a primary affection in the submaxillary gland, but it may extend from neighboring parts to this with other structures. It is, however, in the surrounding absorbent glands that this disease is most usu- ally met Avith. Cancer causes much pain, and occasions a hard, fixed, irregular mass, Avhicli soon iiiAmh^es the skin and mucous membrane, and ends in foul ulceration. If it groAvs to any size, it produces pressure, and may at an early date arrest the floAV of saliva from the affected gland. The al)3orbent glands cpiickly participate, and tlie Avhole of the parts are matted together in one mass. To remove a submaxillary gland so affected is no easy matter, and by the time the true nature of the disease is fully recognized and an operation determined on, it is usually hopeless as regards the saving of life. Jobert (de Lamljalle^) and others, are said to have removed small cancerous tumors of the submaxillary through the mouth, Avithout any ex- ternal excision, but they must have been of trifling size, little adherent, and of a sim])licity seldom encountered. The drainage Avould necessarily be bad, the difficulties great if the tumor Avere of any considerable bulk, and the advantage over the usual operation, beloAV the jaAV, difficult to discover. Unless the t umor lias attained a large size, it is not a formidable operation to remove it by an external incision. The facial artery, Avhich lies on or in the substance of the gland, is the only vessel which is likely to give trouble. It is best tied before the groAvth is moved from its bed. The hypoglossal and lingual nerves can be easily axoided, and the branch of the lingual artery which is cut can be readilj^ secured. ' Graz, des Hupitaux, 1849,

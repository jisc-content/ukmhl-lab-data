CHEILOPLASTIC OPERATIONS. 487 Fig. 984 represents a chasm of the form of a parallelogram produced by the excision of the lower lip, and two curved flaps extending below the base of the jaw, and with their upper free extremities separated by a triangular portion of integument which is left above the chin. Fig. 986 represents these flaps as drawn up to form the reconstructed lower lip, and supported by the triangular buttress of integument which was left in sitti. Pig. 984. Fig. 985. Reconstruction of lower lip. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 986 represents a chasm similar to that of Fig. 984, but with vertical flaps on each side, with their free extremities directed upward, and designed to be turned edgewise so that their free extremities shall meet in the median line, as represented in Fig. 987. Reconstruction of lower lip by another method. (After Szymanowski.) Fig. 988 represents a case in which the whole border of the lower lip is destroyed, but in whicli the loss of substance does not extend far down towards the chin. Three portions of skin are excised, each of tlie form of a spherical triangle, the middle one with its base upward and its apex towards the chin,

This accident usually occurs during eating, but rnaj^ occur during the deglutition of saliva. Foreign Bodies introduced by way of the Walls of the Air-tube.— Foreign liodies may gain access to the air-passage from the outside, both by direct penetration, as in the oft-cited case of La Martiniere,'® in which a pin attached to a whijvcord had penetrated the trachea; and ly indirect transit, as in gunshot wounds (see p. 634). Fauvel'® has recorded at length an instance in which a bullet, that had lodged originally somewliere in the liones of the face, Avas found in the larynx ten years afterwards, and was spontaneously expelled from the left pyriform sinus. Tauljer'^® removed a bullet from the same locality twelve years after a gunshot wound of the neck. Wounds and perforations of the trachea and bronclii occasionally afford opportunity for tlie entrance of a foreign body.

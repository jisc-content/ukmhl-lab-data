363 DESCRIPTION OF INSTRUMENTS, ETC. inferior meatus are distinctly visible, the extent of the view of the two latter depending, however, upon the natural formation of the parts; for it is exceedingly common to find a defiection of the septum nasi to one side, usually the left, narrowing more or less the res|)ective naris, occasionally occluding it, and preventing all view of the deeper parts. On the other hand, cases are met with in which a very wide and roomy meatus permits of a view directly through it into the pharynx, and of the pharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube.

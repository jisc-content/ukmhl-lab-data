But there are cases in which the symmetry of the lips can be better secured by it than by any other method. Szymanowskh^ gives illustrations and descriptions of a number of ingenious operations for the removal of deformities of the lips. I have selected a num- ber of these illustrations, and I have no doubt that many useful hints may be derived from their careful study.

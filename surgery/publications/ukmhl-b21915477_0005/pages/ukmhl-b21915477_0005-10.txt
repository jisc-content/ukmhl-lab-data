PREFACE. VI brilliant literary labor. This hope has been disappointed ; but the Editor thinks himself most fortimatc in having' been able to secure as Professor Gross’s snccessor, a gentleman—Dr. G. J. Fisher, of Sing Sing, N. Y.—who is widely and jnstly distinguished for his erndition, and for his thorough familiarity with the History of the Surgeon’s Art. d'wo other deaths amono- the Editor’s collaborators ninst be brieflv referred to: that of the late Dr. J. 1\[arion Si^is—a genins in surgery, and the inan to whom more than to any one else American Gynm- eology owes its ])rescnt prond position—and that of the late Dr. CiiAKLES 'r. Hunter, whose long and ])ainfnl illness, and early death, arrested his nscfid and honorable career just when he was ai)parcntly abont to reap in widening reputation and increasing practice, the H'wards which he had so justly earned by skill’ul and conscientious but unostentatious labor, and by strict and unflagging attention to everv dutv which devolved upon him. I'lie careful and i)ractical character of Dr. Hunter’s professional work is well illustrated by his article on Minor Surgery, in the first volume of tlie Encyclopiedia; that on Ovarian 'rumors, etc., wliicli Dr. Sims was expected to furnish, has beeii kindly undertaken by Dr. Paul E. Mnndc, of New 'S'ork, whose name is a sufficient guarantee I'or the ability and thoroughness witli whicli the work will be accomplished.

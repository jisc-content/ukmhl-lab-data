The internal use of aconitine has been highly recommended in the treatment of neuralgia. It was brought to the attention of the pro- fession b}^ Dr. Gulder, who published an article on the subject in 1877.^ Prof. Gubler used Ilottot’s preparation of nitrate of aconitine, commencing with doses of yi-jj- grain and increasing them when necessary to jL gi’ain. He regarded heart-disease as contraindicating the drug. Dr. E. C. Seguiii^ has published a report made to the Hew York Therapeutical Society, giving his experience in the use of aconitine in facial neuralgia. He has obtained good results from the use of this remedy. The internal use of salicylate of sodium in doses of from 1 to 5 grammes daily has been recommended by Dr. Descroi- zelles.^ Dr. Howard Pinkney reports a case of facial neuralgia of two years’ standing, cured by the use of sulphite of sodium, in scruple doses four times a day.^ Relief has been afforded by the use of tonga.® Drs. Rockwell, Beard, and Heftel report successful results from the emplojmient of electricity.® Cases are said to have been cured by hypodermic injections of a two-per-cent, solution of carbolic acid.^ Lennox Brown highly recommends the external application of a mixture of equal parts of chloral hydrate and camphor.® Dr. J. IMason "Warren, in his Surgical Observations, relates cases in which great relief was aftbrded by the persistent use of hypodermic ijqections of morphia. In some of these cases, a permanent cure seems to have been effected. An ointment of vera- trine, 10 grs. to Ij, has been used as an external application with marked advantage, being rubbed over the painful parts at intervals of two or three hours. The division of the affected branches of the fifth pair of nerves has been resorted to in a large number of cases. In some of these, complete relief has followed the operation, but in most instances the pain has returned after a longer or shorter interval. The mere division of the nerve generally fails to afford a permanent cure. Excision of a considerable portion of the nerve yields better results, but in many cases the cure is not permanent. The operation of neurectomy is often unsuccessful, because tbe nerve is not excised sufficiently near to its origin. Dr. Carnochan, of Hew York, is entitled to the credit of having first directed the attention of surgeons to this important fact in the case of the superior maxillary nerve, and of having devised an ope- ration for the excision of the nerve in the immediate vicinity of the foramen rotundum. He performed this operation for the first time on the 16th of October, 1856.® He raised a triangular flap, bounded by two incisions extend- ing downward and outward from the inner canthus, and downward and inward from the outer canthus, meeting at a point half an inch in a vertical line below the infra-orbital foramen. From the apex of this triangular flap, a sharp-pointed straight bistoury was next thrust through the cheek into the cavity of the mouth, and an incision was carried downward and inward through the upper lip, dividing it completely to a point midway between the median line and the labial commissure. The upper triangular flap 1 Gaz. Hebdom., 9 Fev. 1877 ; Am. Jouni. Med. Sci., April, 1877 ; Practitioner, Aug. 1877. 2 New York Med. Journal, Dec. 1878.

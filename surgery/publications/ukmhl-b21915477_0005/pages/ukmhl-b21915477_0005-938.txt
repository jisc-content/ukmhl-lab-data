874 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE ABDOMEN. ('ontasion and ]{apt are of Hernia.—Cases have been reported by S. Cooper,* AVatson,^ rolaud,^ and others, of rapture of the intestine from kicks or blows indicted upon individuals the suljject of hernia, tliong’h the part of the bowel raptured was not that contained within the hernial sac. Such accidents have more frequently happened to men with inguinal or scrotal hernise than to women; but one case, Avhich was the subject of medico-legal inquiry, occurred in a woman with femoral hernia. This case, wliich is reported by ^\'atson, was that of a Avoman avIio Avas struck by her husband on the abdo- men, and died in tAvelve hours; the ruptured boAvel Avas at a distance from the liernia, but opposite to a bruise on the abdominal Avail; and as there Avas no fecal matter in, nor indamrnation of, the sac, the husband Avas convicted. The folloAving ease Avas under the care of Mr. llulke:— A man, seventy years of age, Avas bronglit into the Middlesex Hospital on the 8th of February, 1881, Avith fracture of the pelvis and rupture of the urethra, for Avhich perineal section Avas performed. He died the same day. At the post-mortem exami- nation, a hernial sac in tlie right inguinal region Avas found to contain coils of ileum about eleven and one-half inches long, and at the entrance into the sac a transverse rupture of the gut had occurred, the coats being divided almost as cleanly as if they had been cut. Some fluid feces had escaped into the peritoneal cavity, and had set up acute general peritonitis; the intestines Avere distended Avith llatus and fecal matter. Another class of cases, and one to Avhich Aston Ivey^ and Poland® have draAvn special attention, is that in Avhich the portion of the boAvel Avithin the hernial sac has received the bloAv. These injuries also occur chiefly in males Avith inguinal, or more es[)ecitilly Avith scrotal hernite. In some cases the hernia has been reducible, and a truss has been Avorn, but, the bloAv having- forced aside the pad of the truss, the boAvel has received the effects of the Auolence. In other cases, the Adolence has been receh-ed directly upon an irre- ducilde hernia; in a few, the injury has been inflicted Avhilst the boAvel has been held in place by a truss. The injury may result in (1) contusion, folloAved by inflammation of the coats of the intestine, and of the sac; (2) contusion, folloAved b}* sloughing of the intestine, if the Autality of its coats has been destroyed; (3) rupture of the bowel. These three conditions are attended by the symptoms Avhlch arise in cases of corresponding injury to boAvel not contained Avithin a hernial sac, Avith, genei-ally, this additional one, namely, that the soft parts about the hernial region l)ecome red and oedema- tons, and may threaten to or do actually hurst. If the lAOAvel have ruptured, the iecal extraAuisation, though it takes place first into the sac, Avill soon find its Avay into the general cavity of the peritoneum, unless an incision be made into the sac as in operating for strangulated hernia. Prognosis.—In all the cases of aa Inch I am aAA-are, in Avhich the boAvel has been ru})tured by the injury, death has folloAved. In tAvo cases reported by Ivey, in Avhicli, after injury to the hernia, acute inflammatorj' symptoms and vomiting set in, tlie sac Avas laid open, and, though the boAvel subsequently sloughed, the resulting artificial anus closed spontaneously, and complete recovery took place, in one case in four, in the other in ten Aveeks. 'Treatment.—In all cases in which a hernia has been injured, the hernial sac should be laid open if there be severe local or constitutional s3unptoms, Avhe- ther the boAvel be in the hernial sa-c or not Avhen the ])atient is seen. Reduc- tion of the hernia b}' taxis should never be attempted if there be or liaA-e l)een symptoms indicative of severe contusion of the boAvel. It may happen that • Dictionary of Surgery.

CLOSURE OP THE JAWS. 549 * Hritisli Medical Journal, June 1, 1872. ing the upper end of the first, was carried along the lower border of the zygoma. The parotid and the facial nerve were drawn down, and with a periosteal ele- vator the posterior fibres of the masseter were cleared away, and the articu- lation exposed. A narrow osteotomy chisel was now apjilied to the neck of the condyle, and carefully driven half through tlie bone, when by forcibly opening the mouth the bone was broken through. The neck of the condjde was then carefully removed piecemeal, Imt the condyle itself was left m situ. The result was satisfactory. Sedillot* mentions that, in a case of true anchy- losis of the temporo-maxillary articulation, M. Grubc, in 1863, carried a straight chisel through the mouth to the neck of the jaw, which he broke by hammer- ing. Some months later he divided the masseter subcutaneously, and the cure, by the formation of a false joint, was permanent. In 18791 performed the same operation in a child of six, but the results were unsatisfactory. Suppuration was set up, and rerpiired an external opening, and the movement, which was free at first, became as limited as before the operation. It would appear, therefore, that mere division of the neck of the bone does not otfer such good prospect of a permanent false joint as removal of the neck or the condyle, though these operations ai-e necessarily more severe. Esmarch’s operation, performed in front of the masseter, is of course as applicable to cases of anchylosis from disease of the joint as to cases of cica- trix, and Fischei’^ appears to have performed the operation on l)oth sides of the jaw, in a case of bilateral anchylosis of tlie tcm}ioro-maxillary articulation, with very good result, the patient obtaining complete and useful control over the central, movable portion of the jaw. • * Meiiecine ojieratoire, tome ii. p. 30.

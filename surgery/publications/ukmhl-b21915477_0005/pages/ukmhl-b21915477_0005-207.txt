GENERAL SCHEME OF THE TUMORS OF THE VAULT OF THE SKULL. 167 GEJ^ERAL SCHEME OF THE TUMORS OF THE VAULT OF THE SKULL. ARRANGED FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES. I.â€”Tumors that Communicate with the Cranial Cavity. [Common features: Reducibility. Pulsation. Increase on expiration. Hole in bone often to be felt. May be cerebral disturbance on pressure or attempted reduction.] A. Congenital. 1. Encephalocele. 2. Meningocele. 3. Hi/drencephalocele. 4. External cephalhcematoma, communicating with an internal cephal- hajmatoma through a perforation in the bone. B. No T CONGENITAL. 5. Fungus of dura muter. 6. Aneurism of middle meningeal artery that has perforated the bone. 7. External venous tumor communicating with the superior longitudinal sinus. 8. External collection of pus communicating with an internal collection through a perforation in the bone. II.â€”Tumors that do not Communicate with the Cranial Cavity. A. Tumors that pulsate. 1. Aneurism. 2. Arterial erectile tumor. 3. Certain sarcomata of the cranial hones. B. Gaseous tumors. 4. Pneumatocele, the only tumor tympanitic on percussion. C. Tumors mmth fluid contents. 5. Simple haematoma, either (a) in substance of scalp; (b) beneath aponeurosis; or (c) beneath pericranium; blood maybe coagulated. 6. Cephulhcematoma, in infants only ; mostly over parietal bone. 7. Abscess, either (a) in substance of scalp; (b) beneath aponeurosis ; or (c) beneath pericranium. 8. Serous cyst, very rare. Hydatid cyst of bone. 9. Certain sebaceous and dermoid cysts, whose contents have softened, may appear to contain fluid. D. Solid tumors. 10. Exostosis, 11. Sarcoma and, carcinoma of bone, 12. Dermoid cyst, contents often fluid, 13. Papilloma, 14. Common sebaceous cyst, contents often more or less fluid, ! in substance 1.5. Sarcoma of scalp, | of scalp. 16. Solid congenital tumor of scalp, J 17. Lipoma. 18. Fibroma. 19. Osteoma of scalp (?). 20. Gumma. It must be noted that certain of the tumors in Class I., v\z., fungus of the dura mater and meningocele, may cease to present any evidence of communication with the cranial cavity, and that certain tumors in Class II., viz., certain sarcomata of the bone, that liave perforated, and some dermoid cysts, may acquire some of the signs that are con- sidered to indicate origin from within the cranial cavity. |> deeply seated.

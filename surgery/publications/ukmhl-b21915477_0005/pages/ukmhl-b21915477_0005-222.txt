At the inner end of each tarsus are the openings of the canaliculi, one above and one below. These points, surrounded by some cir- cularly disposed fibres of the orbicu- laris muscle, are called the ‘puncta lachrymalia. The small canals leading from them into the lachrymal sac, are the canaliculi. They sometimes unite before reaching the sac, and at other times enter it separately. Lying in the lachrymal groove of the os unguis, tra- versed near its middle and supported by the tendo oculi of the orbicularis mus- cle, is the lachrymal] sac, which passes by the nasal duct to the inferior mea- tus of the nose.

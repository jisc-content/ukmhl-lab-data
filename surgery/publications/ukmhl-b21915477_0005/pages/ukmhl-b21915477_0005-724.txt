INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE AIR-PASSAGES. 664 Foreign Bodies in the Air-Passages. Water, food, or mucus, frequently, and something that should not have been put in the mouth, occasionally, “ goes the wrong way,” or gets into the air-tube, when one laughs, coughs, talks, cries, or makes a sudden inspiration, Avith any of these things in the month. Ordinarily the substance is ejected in a tit of coughing, and the accident passes out of remembrance with a laugh and a sense of relief. When any difficulty occurs in thus ejecting the intrud- ing substance, the individual, often an infant, is slapped on the back by a hj'stander, the head and chest being bent strongly forAvard; and then the matter is ejected by the combined agencies of succussion, cough, and gravity. In A^ery many instances, hoAvever, and especially Avhen some substance, foreign in the literal sense, is in the mouth, the intruder is not dislodged so readiry, but remains temporarily or permanently imprisoned in the air-passage. It may be loosely contined, or may become firmly impacted, Avhether in the larynx, the trachea, or a bronchus; and if not released, it may suffocate the patient at once, or at any subsequent period, varying Avithin the extreme limits of minutes or of years. Foreign bodies gain access to the air-passage in diverse manners, both by Avay of the natural orifice, and by AA^ay of a perforation through its Avails, Avhether from the exterior of the body or from the interior. Foreign Bodies introduced by the Natural Orifice.—Sudden inspira- tion, Avhether A^oluntaiy, incautious, accidental, or forced, Avhile a mass of food or a movable foreign substance is in the mouth, is by far the most fre- quent source of the entrance of foreign bodies into the air-passages. Among other substances tlius introduced, the folloAving may be enumerated : AA^ater, going down the Avrong way detached plates Avith artificial teeth f matters A^omited during repletion,^ epileptic seizure,^ apoplexy, unconsciousness and paralysis,® or ansesthesia ;® regurgitated chyme,’ curdled milk,® or meconium ; parasites from the alimentary tract,® or from the nasal passages and adjoining sinuses; leeches carelessly applied to the mouth,^® or inhaled Avhile drinking from a fountain, stream, or hydrant teeth dislodged or crushed into 1 Monteggia, Inst.

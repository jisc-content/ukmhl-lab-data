795 CONTUSIONS OF THE CHEST. In severer cases, a force acting with still more continued energy breaks the ribs, and drives the fragments, as in the preceding class, througli the external layer of the pleura, and further on into the tissue of the lung; in such injuries a larger area of the chest-wall is crushed, and a greater number of ribs ai’e broken; in post-moi’tem examination of such cases, not uncommonly the lung is found to carry the impress of the fracture of each broken rib, in a lacerated wound corresponding to the extremities of tlie depressed fragments all along the line of the injury, the wounds being, however, inflicted on the lung by only one fragment, anterior or posterior, at each seat of fracture, and all by the fragments on the same side of the line. In such injuries, as, for instance, where a cart-wheel passes over the chest and breaks the bones by direct violence, the line of maximum pressure and the direction of its plane may often be inferred, after death, from the arrangement of the wounds of the lung. This may he of importance, as the resiliency of the ribs is such that we do not And their fragments, excepting in very exceptional circum- stances, retained in their displaced position as fragments of bone are prone to be in other regions, notably in the skull. In this kind of injury, as the result of the shape of the chest, the number of ribs broken on one side of the body is commonly less than the entire twelve, because the force is rarely so applied as to involve all, and at the top of the row, the clavicle and scapula shield the ribs. The signs which indicate the existence of lesions of this class, either the least or most severe, vary materially according as the pleural cavity is normal jirevious to the occurrence of the accident, or has been obliterated in part or entirely bj" adhesion; a contingency so frequent that it must he taken into account in forming a correct diagnosis. If the cavity be normal, even the most limited wound of the parietal pleura by a fractured rib, gives rise in a short time to a localized traumatic ]>leuritis, which, although of little risk to the patient if he be otherwise healthy, adds much to his suflerings while it is active, and, under unfavorable conditions, may cause grave trouble. If adhesions he present at the seat of rupture, this risk is avoided. In the graver injuries, where the ends of the fragments penetrate the lung, the escape of air and of blood into the j)leural cavity is facilitated by the normal con- dition of the cavity, and the risks of })iieumo-thorax and of ha?mo-thorax are added, while their occurrence points to the diagnosis of the injury. On the other hand, emph}^sema of the areolar tissue (the result of the escape of air from the lung into its meshes), originating at the seat of contusion, is facili- tated by the existence of adhesions; its occurrence in this position without a jirevious pneumo-thorax is rendered possible; and lastly, as the most trivial laceration may give rise to it when adhesions exist, its gravity as a s3unptom of wounded lung is greatlj^ diminished. In considering the value of emphj^sema of tlie areolar tissue as a diagnostic sign in these injuries, which are without wound of the integuments, it must he borne in mind that attention must he paid to the ]>lace of origin of the eni}ihysema, whether it arise at the seat of injuiy, the air passing into the areolar tissue external to the parietal }ileura which lias been torn by fractured hones or cartilages, or, on the othei' hand, whether it escape through the mediastinum, as indicated by its apjtearing first in the neck or in the epigas- tric region. In this mode of oilgin, the air may leave the pulmonary vesicles or bronclii by rupture of the ]jarenchyma of the lung, entirelj^ independent of aiy lesion of either layer of the })leural membrane. Commonly this occur- rence of general emphysema—even when it reaches to the degree of distending all the subcutaneous tissue of the hody^—although in appearance, and to the patient’s sensation, an alarming symptom, is not attended with serious danger, particularly" if it he not associated with pneumo-thorax and if it originate

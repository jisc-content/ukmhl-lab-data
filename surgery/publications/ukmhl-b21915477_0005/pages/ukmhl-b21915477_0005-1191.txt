INGUINAL HERNIA. 1127 ligament^ and intenially into the front surface of the pubic angle and sym- physis, sending some hbres to join the ligamentum suspensorium penis vel clitoridis. These hands are separated from each other a little below the cen- tre of Poupart’s ligament, where they form what are called the internal and Fig. 1126. Superficial dissectiou of the inguinal and crural regions, external gillars of the external abdominal ring. Tlie inner one is Hat and ribbon-shape<l; the outer, triangular, rounded lielow and grooved above, for the lodgment of the spermatic cord. They afford an opening for the passage of the spermatic cord or round ligament, the opening being placed directly above the pubic spine, and being oldirpiely triangular in shape, with its liase downwards and its angle upwards and outwards. It is closed in by a liand of fibres (6) lying superficial and closely adherent to the tendon, s[)ringing from the centre of Poupart's ligament, and cuiwing sjireadingly downwards and inwards, so as to cover by a connecting layer of tough fascia the fibres of the tendon and its triangular opening or ring. These fibres are continued downwards (/j as one of the coverings of the cord to join the scrotal fascia. They convert the triangular opening into an irregularly oval or circular one. The opening thus formed is the sngerfidal or external ahdomined ring. Of the fibrous bands or pillars of the ring which bound the opening laterally, the inner is placed above, and the outer l>elow the opening, in an oblique directioti. The curved bauds of fibres which bind these together and form the upper boundary, are tlie areiforni jihres {h)\ the fascia between the pillars is the mtercolumnar fasna; und the ])i’olonged fascia over the cords is the external simanaiie fascia {i). Internal to the ring, and extending quite behind it at the lower x»art, can

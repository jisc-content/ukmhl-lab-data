178 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE EYES AND THEIR APPENDAGES. The conducting fibres of the optic nerve, estimated at 438,000, unfolding in the papilla, bend suddenly outwards and are lost in the retina, constituting its innermost layer, in which are distributed the arteries and veins. Stu- died in microscopic sections, there are ten distinct layers in the thickness of the retina. (Fig. 852.) The tenth of these, the pigment epithelium, formerly described as belonging to the choroid, and in which are buried the outer ends of the rods and cones, is now known to be an integral and very important part of the retina. The rods and cones standing perpendicularly in the outer layer of the retina, are the percipient elements ; the inner layer is composed of nerve- fibres which are conductors; and the intermediate structures serve to connect these two essential elements. Filling and giving solidity to the globe of the eye, and with the cornea forming its refracting media, are the acpieous and vitreous humors with the crystalline lens between them. (Fig. 853.) Fig. 853. Diagrammatic horizontal section of the eye. (After Merkel.) The space between the cornea and the lens is the aqueous chamber^ di- vided by the iris into the anterior and posterior, communicating through the pu])il. The depth of the anterior chamber is 3.G mm. In active accommo- dation, the lens capsule, becoming more convex and carrying the iris for- w^ards, diminishes slightly the depth of the chamber. It is now positively certain that the lens"^ acted on by tlie ciliary muscle, is the mstj'ument of accommodation. As age progresses the lens hardens, responding less and less

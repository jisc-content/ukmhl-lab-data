AMPUTATIONS. 676 suitable compresses being adjusted so as to keep the deep parts of the wound in apposition. Tbe statistics of amputation at tbe hip-joint have been investigated by various surgeons, among whom I may particularly mention Prof. Stephen Smith, of New York; Mr. W. Sands Cox, of Birmingham ; the late Dr. G. A. Otis, of the United States Army; and Dr. A. Liming, of Zurich. Dr. F. C. Sheppard, of Philadelphia, has at my request made extensive researches into the literature of the subject, and has succeeded in collecting 633 cases of this operation, the details of which he has arranged for me in tabular form. These statistics are much more comprehensive than any which have hitherto been published, and show very conclusively the gravity of the operation, par- ticularly in traumatic cases. The following summaries show the results of the operation (1) in military practice; (2) in cases of injury treated in civil life; (3) in cases of disease; (4) in cases the nature of which is not certainly known ; and (5) in cases of all kinds taken together.

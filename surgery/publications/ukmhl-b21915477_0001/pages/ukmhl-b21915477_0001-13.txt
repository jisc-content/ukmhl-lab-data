PREFACE. Vll \ expressly for this work, either from photographs or from drawings, many of which are from the skilful pencil of the Editor’s friend and former pupil, Dr. J. Madison Taylor. The Editor * desires to offer his sincere thanks to the many distin- guished surgeons and physicians, who—in several instances, at the cost of great personal inconvenience—have given him their aid as collabora- tors, and without whose valued assistance the production of the Ency- clopaedia would have been impossible. His thanks are also due for important help of various kinds, rendered by Dr. W. M. Carpenter, of New York, and by Dr. H. R. Wharton and Dr. F. C. Sheppard, of Philadelphia. JOHN ASHHURST, Jr. Philadelphia, 2000 West Delancey Place, November, 1881.

CAUSES OP TRAUMATIC DELIRIUM. 389 Burns and scalds are probably more apt to be attended with delirium than any other class of injuries. In rapidly fatal cases, where there is no reaction from shock, the brain is generally clear, and remains so until death. During this time, all susceptibility to pain having been lost, and the sense of touch being gone through the destruction of its principal organ, the skin, the intel- ligence takes no cognizance of the vast calamity. I have seen, after deep and extensive burns, what seemed to be a living soul looking out of a crisp, charred, and dead body. I have seen a child thus burnt playing with toys an hour before its death. Sometimes, in this condition, there is what appears to be a pleasant and mild delirium. “ Death having preyed upon the outward parts, Leaves them insensible ; and his siege is now Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds With many legions of strange fantasies ; Which in their throng and press to that last hold, Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing.” A much greater mercy is extended to these than to those whose burns are inevitably fatal, and yet who survive the shock for days, weeks, and it may Fig. 30.

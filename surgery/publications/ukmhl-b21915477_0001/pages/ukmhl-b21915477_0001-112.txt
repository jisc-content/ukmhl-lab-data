66 INFLAMMATION. The science of human pathology, which took its origin in the study, after death, of the anatomical changes of the diseased organs and tissues of the body—morbid anatomy, as it is usually called—was inaugurated mainly by the French school, early in the present century. Its first great advances established the identity of what was called inflammation, as manifested on the surface of the body and in wounds, with similar conditions affecting its internal organs, an identity which had never been demonstrated. Under the influence of the plausible theories of Brown and Broussais, inflammation, thus advanced to a more extended domain, came to be considered as the most important of all the pathological forces; an uniform termination was affixed to the names of inflammatory diseases—itis—significant of the afflux of blood to the inflamed part—“ itio in partes and the treatment of the diseases thus distinguished, which formed, according to their assumption, a large majority of human maladies, was of necessity, following these premises, intrinsically antiphlogistic. The period is within the memory of the writer when it was the dominant doctrine in the schools that inflammation, in some form, con- stituted the essential factor in most diseases. The application of the microscope to the study of morbid anatomy subse- quently demonstrated, by degrees, the existence of a variety of degenerations and other morbid changes constantly taking place in the tissues and organs of the body, which were evidently unconnected in any way with inflamma- tion. Through the advance in more accurate knowledge, inflammation has therefore ceased to be regarded as such an omnipresent disease; it has come to be considered, in fact, as in no respect an essential disease, but rather a condition liable to be provoked in the organism by certain harmful influenqes, called for convenience the causes of inflammation; a condition located mainly in the apparatus of nutrition, affecting a limited area, and consisting in a temporary perversion of the mechanism of nutrition from its natural and regular order, which is characterized by a series of phenomena already de- scribed by the histologist, and to be hereafter considered from a clinical point of view under the title of symptoms of inflammation. It should not be, therefore, a matter of surprise that the terms employed in treating of inflammation, including indeed the word itself, have been gradually changing their signification in accordance with the growth of more precise knowledge; and, lest the mind should be influenced by the more vague and pretentious meaning heretofore attached to these terms, the fact of this change in signification should be held in constant remembrance. The term inflammation will be employed in the ensuing pages as including the series of textural changes—microscopic, as well as macroscopic—which take place in living tissues after they have been subjected to injury. For the sake of convenience, the term “constructive” will be applied to the phenomena of afflux, exudation, cell germination, the formation of new capillary vessels, and the development of cicatricial tissue—in other words, to the inflammatory phenomena which constitute the simple uncomplicated “ process of repair whilst the additional presence of suppuration, ulceration, or gangrene, and all other harmful complications of the process, will be included under the term “destructive.” In this connection it may be observed that inflammation has heretofore been treated of by systematic writers as a disease, with certain characteristic features, and tending to certain “terminations.” The convenience of this mode of handling the subject is obvious ; but its scientific correctness is open to question. In popular, and also in professional language, it is common to speak of “ an attack of inflammation” as of an attack of tetanus; and the remedial measures employed in its treatment have been habitually designated as “antiphlogistic.” Flow, inflammation, although presenting in some of its

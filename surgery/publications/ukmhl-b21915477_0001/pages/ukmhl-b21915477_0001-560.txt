504 MINOR SURGERY. and the seton-thread, either oiled or smeared with some stimulating ointment, if it be desirable to increase the quantity of the discharge, should be moved a little at each change of dressing. Setons are occasionally used to empty chronic abscesses or cysts; in cases of the latter, and in those of hydrocele, the presence of a seton in the sac will sometimes effect a cure by exciting sufficient inflammatory action to cause adhesion of the walls. The Actual Cautery, consisting of some form of metallic substance brought to a high degree of temperature, constitutes the most powerful counter-irritant in use. It is likewise employed for the purposes of checking hemorrhage and destroying diseased growths. The cauteries most commonly employed are made of iron, and are fixed in handles of wood or other non-conducting material, and have their heads or extremities fashioned in a variety of shapes, as the olive, the button, the hatchet, etc. (Fig. 76.) This variety in shape is designed to meet the special in- Flg‘ 76- dications for which cauting-irons are used, and to suit different localities. In an emergency, an ordinary knitting-needle, or a poker, or other piece of iron, may be made to serve the purpose. The irons may be heated in a brazier which usually accompa- nies a set of the instruments, or in an ordinary fire, or by the flame of a spirit-lamp. When the actual cautery is resorted to for its revulsive effect, the hatchet-shaped iron is the one usually selected. This, heated to a dull red heat, should be quickly di’awn over the skin in Cauting-irons of various shapes. Fig. 77. Paquelin’s thermo-cautery.

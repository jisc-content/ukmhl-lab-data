AMPUTATIONS. 664 superadding a square flap from the back of the limb, obviates its dis- advantages. Posterior Flap Method.—This, which is known as Hoin’s method, I do not hesitate to pronounce to be a bad operation. The large muscular flap, taken from the calf, is so heavy as to be with difficulty kept in position, and the resulting cicatrix is placed in the least desirable position. Anterior Flap Method.—This, which is essentially the method adopted by Nathan Smith, of New Haven, in 1824, is, I think, upon the whole, the best mode of removing the limb at the knee-joint. The anterior flap, which is almost entirely a cutaneous one, is made very much as the anterior branch of the ellipse in Baudens’s operation, except that it is rather more square (Fig. 193); a shorter, square, posterior flap is also cut from the integument of the Fig. 193. upper part of the calf, and, after disarticulation, the wound is brought together, making a small cicatrix which is well protected from pressure. Lateral Flap Method.—This mode of performing the operation was intro- duced by Eossi, and consists, as its name implies, in taking flaps from either side of the leg, the resulting cicatrix being placed midway between the two femoral condyles. This operation has been improved by Prof. Stephen Smith, of New York, by carrying the point at which the flaps join posteriorly further up than in front. A convenient means of effecting drainage is thus provided, while the natural coverings of the front of the knee are not interfered with. A similar operation is employed by Prof. Smith in amputating both above and below the knee. Some difference of opinion exists as to whether or no the patella should be removed in amputating at the knee-joint, but I strongly recommend that it should be retained. Its presence adds greatly to the rotundity and firmness of the stump, and its removal renders the anterior flap so thin that sloughing

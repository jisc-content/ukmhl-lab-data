SCURVY. 294 bility of the blood differs from that of blood in health, though Wood alleges that the clot is loose and cotton-like, and Canstatt that its coagulability * in consequence of the large proportion of saline matters, is diminished. In Busk’s cases, the separation of the clot and serum was as perfect, and took place as rapidly, as in healthy blood, and in two of them the blood was both buffed and cupped, as it was also in Leven’s cases. In two of the most severe of Becquerel’s cases the blood coagulated firmly, and in a slight case the clot was dark and loose. The albumen of the blood shows no marked change as regards its quantity. The five analyses of Becquerel and Rodier showed the average amount of organic matters of the serum to be 64.3 parts in a thousand, the smallest being 56.2 and the largest 69.2 parts. One thousand parts of the serum of the same cases gave an average of 72.1 parts of organic matter. Frick’s single case gave 87.045 parts per thousand, and the average of Busk’s was 78.2 parts, while Chotin and Bouvier obtained only 62.3 parts. The last-mentioned writers have recorded a fact in connection with the physical characters of scorbutic blood that deserves notice: the blood in one case did not coagulate at the usual temperature—about 158° F.—but required a tem- perature some degrees higher for that purpose. The red corpuscles in all the foregoing cases were notably diminished, the largest amount given being 117.078 parts per thousand, while the lowest was 47.8 parts. In Andral’s second case the globules had decreased to 44.4 parts per thousand, the lowest amount yet recorded. The alkalinity of the blood seems not to be changed, although Chotin and Bouvier notice a slight increase. The saline constituents do not vary greatly from the normal standard. The average amount in Becquerel and Rodier’s, and Busk’s, cases was 8.1 parts per thousand, the smallest being 5.5 parts and the largest 11.5. In Dr. Ritchie’s two analyses, the proportion of saline matters is given as 6.44 and 6.82 parts per thousand. Opitz and Schneider have found less than the physiological mean. In Frick’s case the amount was 8.8, the iron being 0.721 parts per thousand, and 0.782 to 127 parts of globules; lime 0.110, chlorides 6.846, and phosphates 1.116 parts per thou- sand. The iron was in excess of that in the normal blood, but in Becquerel’s cases the mean was 0.381—less than the normal. The proportion of iron in Duchek’s cases was respectively 0.393, 0.402, and 0.476 parts, giving a mean of 0.423 parts per thousand, which nearly approximates the normal. Garrod in one analysis of the blood found a deficiency of the potassium salts, upon which he erected his well-known theory of the etiology of the disease. It is an interesting fact that in the physiological state the quantity of sodium chloride is not subject to variation, any excess introduced with the food being thrown off by the kidneys. The quantity in the urine bears a relation to the amount introduced as food, but the proportion in the blood is constant. The quantity of water in the blood has been found to be increased in all the analyses which have been made. Chotin and Bouvier estimated water and loss at 831.1; in Frick’s case it was 791.69 parts per thousand; and in Becquerel’s five cases it was put at 807.7, 810.9, 811, 813.7, and 854.0 parts per thousand respectively. In Busk’s three cases the lowest amount Avas 835.9, and the highest 849.9 parts per thousand. The specific gravity of the deffbrinated blood Avas in all cases Ioav in comparison with the normal stan- dard, 1057, the average in Becquerel and Rodier’s cases being 1047.2, the lowest 1038.3, and the highest 1051.7. In the single observation of Chotin and Bouvier it A\'as 1060. The specific gravity of the serum was also less than normal (1027), the average of four of Becquerel’s analyses giving 1023.8, the lowest 1020.8 and the highest 1025.5. Busk gives 1025 in one case and 1028 in another. The results of the most recent analyses, those of Chalvet, are shown in the

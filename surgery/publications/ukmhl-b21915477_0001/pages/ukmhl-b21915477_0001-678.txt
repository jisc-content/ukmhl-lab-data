618 AMPUTATIONS. copal Hospital, and from these limitations of time and space, and from the fact that I dressed stumps then precisely as I did before and have done since, I am disposed to attribute them to local and climatic rather than to any other causes. Table showing Causes of Death in Twenty-eight Fatal Cases of Major Amputation. Direct result of injury . 6 Acute mania . . 1 hock . . 4 Exhaustion . 6 Secondary hemorrhage . . 3 Pyaemia .... . 4 Tetanus .... . 2 Delirium tremens . . 2 Total . 28" Deducting six deaths from the direct result of injury, and three from delirium tre- mens and acute mania—which have certainly no connection with the operation per se the mortality would be reduced to a little over 20 per cent., or one in five. My first 50 cases gave 18 deaths (including all that have occurred from pyaemia), or, making the corresponding deductions, 14 out of 46, a mortality of 30 per cent. ; while my second 50 cases gave but 10 deaths, or, with the corresponding deductions, 5 out of 45, a mor- tality of only 11 per cent. The mortality after amputation is influenced by various circumstances which are quite independent of the skill of the operator, the most important being the age, constitutional condition, and sex of the patient, his hygienic sur- roundings before and after the operation, the nature of the lesion for which amputation is performed, the period of operation, and the part of the body in- volved. A few remarks upon each of these points will conclude what I have to say as to the causes of death after amputation. Age of Patient.—Amputations in children are usually successful. The remarkable case of synchronous amputation of the hip and leg, which I have recorded on page 591, would not have ended in recovery had the patient been an adult. Statistics showing the effect of age in determining the results of amputations have been collected by several writers, among -whom I may par- ticularly mention M. Malgaigne, of Paris, the late Mr. Callender, Mr. Holmes and Mr. Golding-Bird, of London, Dr. Gorman, of Boston, and Dr. Morton, of Philadelphia. The last-mentioned surgeon,2 from an analysis of 982 cases of amputation treated in the Pennsylvania Hospital during 50 years, from 1830 to 1879, gives the following Table showing the figures bearing upon this point:— Table showing the effect of Age on the Results of Amputation at the Pennsylvania Hospital.

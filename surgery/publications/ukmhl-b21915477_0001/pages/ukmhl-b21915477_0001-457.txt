TREATMENT OF DELIRIUM TREMENS. 401 The peculiar tremors of delirium tremens are very characteristic ; if I may so express it, they are loose and free, without spasmodic jerkings ; somewhat jelly-like, and giving a general idea of instability. They seem to say “ prop me up, prop me up; if you don’t prop me up, I shall die.” Fig. 36. fl O Temperature. © © 'p.

During the stage of delirium the patient was treated with morphia hypodermically (a quarter of a grain every six hours), and chloral (15 grains) and bromide of potassium (30 grains) every four hours, by the mouth. The diet consisted of liquid and concentrated food : heef-tea with capsicum, milk, soup, etc. Mechanical restraint was employed from June 17 to June 20. Recovery. Treatment of Delirium Tremens.—The disease being one of depression, it is this “ propping up” that is required in the treatment. Nourishment and sleep will bring most cases to a successful issue. Of course the nourishment must be digested, and the digestive organs may not at first he ready for their work. To those who are not too weak, an emetic may be given with most excellent effect. One of the best is mustard and water. Then the bowels may require attention, for often the patient has been very neglectful of him- self in this respect. An enema, a large one, of soap and water, will mostly accomplish the object. This plan may look like reducing the patient. On the contrary, it is simply aiding to bring the digestive apparatus into a recep- tive state. There is no use in cramming down what will not be assimilated, and what will be almost certainly rejected. After the stomach has become somewhat retentive, we may begin with small amounts of hot and well-spiced beet-tea, or soup, repeated at short intervals. If milk can be taken, so much the better. As to medicines, opium, the bromide of potassium, chloral hydrate, the tincture of digitalis, and alcohol, are at the command of the surgeon. vol. i.—26

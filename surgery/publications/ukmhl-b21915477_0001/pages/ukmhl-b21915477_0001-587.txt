( 531 ) PLASTIC SURGERY. BY CHRISTOPHER JOHNSTON, M.D., EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF SURGERY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE. The Surgical Art Formative (jtidaanv to form) boasts of a high antiquity, and was resorted to in remote times, as at present, to repair, remedy, or conceal the ravages and disfigurements of disease, as well as to lessen the deformities produced by the execution of judicial decrees, by natural defects, or by the accidents of personal or general conflict. That branch of this department of surgery which has for its object the restoration of noses, very probably antedated the other branches, as the records of Indian and Egyptian surgical art seem to indicate; but while the subdivisions of the art multiply, as various organs or parts are concerned, the principles governing all plastic proceedings remain the same. The synonyms of this department of surgery are numerous; thus, Chirurgica Plastica; Morioplastice, from nopiov “a part,’’ and mustixo; “forming;” Transplantatio; Chirurgia Anaplastica and Chirurgia Autoplastica—names preferred by Velpeau and Bland m, and derived from the Greek, the one from dvd “again,” and n-kdoauv “to form,” that is, to fashion anew; the other from av-ros “one’s self,” and n-hdaativ “to form,” to form of, or out of, one’s self, or “self creation” (Gross)—whence the words Anaplasty, Autoplasty; and finally Plastic Surgery, or that province of surgery which is distinctively formative. Among the foregoing appellations I revert to Transplantatio, which signifies absolute removal from one part and implantation into another, to point out that such transplantation of larger portions of the body has been designedly accomplished, or an accidentally ablated part successfully reapplied, or blood transfused—all instances of total separation before adjustment, or, in the case of the blood, of perfect abstraction and introduction into the circu- latory system of another individual; and that the same end lias been medi- ately effected as in Roux’s operation, that of “Autoplasty by successive migrations of the flap.” And I would associate with these instances of union of larger surfaces, or multitudes of germs, the modern operation of Reverdin, known as skin grafting, by which extremely small portions of in- tegument, and even epithelial elements scooped from the rete, after being totally separated, are implanted or “grafted” upon tlie surface of tardily heal- ing ulcers, as of burns. Adhesion soon occurs, and is followed by prolifera- tion around the transplanted germs, whether these have been derived from the subject himself, or from another person; whether they are pigmented or otherwise. The transplantation of the spur of the cock, from the leg to the comb, is a familiar example of*tbis mode of procedure, as is also the trans- lated flap of Roux; but in these instances, vitalized adherence terminates the process; whereas, in the case of skin grafting, as practised by Reverdin and

On the authority of Chalvet, it may also be stated that demineralization of the muscular tissue is a notable chemical feature in scurvy. So far, microscopic examination has been entirely negative. Hayem1 found no appreciable alteration from healthy blood, and in this view Leven2 concurs; while Laboulbene3 notes the occurrence of an unusual number of white globules. Symptoms op Scurvy. The symptoms of scurvy are insidiously, and usually slowly, developed under the influence of the etficient causes, and it runs a chronic course, often extending over six or seven months, especially in cases in which the hygienic surroundings of the patient have been imperfectly or not at all rectified. In lighter cases this course is much shorter. A gradual alteration of the nutri- tive processes first occurs, until what might be called a scorbutic cachexia is established, in a period varying from a few weeks to several months. The initial symptoms consist in the skin losing its color and tone, and assuming a yellowish or earthy hue; it is relaxed, dry, unperspiring, and rough; in the legs, particularly, this roughness is very marked, and the skin, when rubbed, sheds an abundance of furfuraceous scales. The cutaneous follicles, markedly on the extensor aspect of the lower extremity, are prominent, similar in ap- pearance and feel to the condition known as “goose flesh.” Ilouppe4 calls this the signum primum pathognomonicum. Dark-red or brownish flecks, of a circular outline, and of varying but small size, not unlike flea-bites, appear on the face and limbs. The cutaneous circulation is feeble, and the superfi- cial warmth less than natural; slight depression of the atmospheric tempera- ture produces a sensation of chilliness, and the feet and hands are cold. On assuming the erect posture, the patient complains of headache and dizziness. The muscles are relaxed, and soft to the feel, and a corresponding loss of vigor and strength is experienced by the patient, who is indisposed to exert himself in the performance of his customary duties, and seeks repose and freedom from feelings of fatigue and languor in recumbency. This prostration is occasionally so extreme that the slightest efforts in attempting to stand or walk are attended with rapid action of the heart, accelerated respiratory 1 Mem. de la Societe de Biologie. 3 Communication to the Academie des Sciences, 1871. 2 Epidemie de Scorbut. 4 De morbis navigantium.

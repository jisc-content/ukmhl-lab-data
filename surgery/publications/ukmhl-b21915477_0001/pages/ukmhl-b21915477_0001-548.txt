Secure the initial end of the roller on the upper part of the left arm by two circular turns, then conduct the bandage over the shoulder, obliquely across the back, through the oppo- site axilla, over the shoulder of the same side, obliquely across the posterior surface of the thorax (crossing the previous turn between the scapulae), through the left axilla, and up to the summit of the shoulder, from which similar turns across the back and through the axilla are to be repeated till the band- age is exhausted. (Fig. 60.) The FiK- 60. same precautions against excoriation of the borders of the axillae are to be adopted as in the case of the pre- ceding bandage. The Suspensory and Compressor Bandage of the Breast. — A roller 64-7§- centimetres (2J-3 inches) wide and - 9^- metres (8-10 yards) long. Make fast the initial end of a roller, placed over the sca- pula of the affected side, by two oblique turns carried over the oppo- site shoulder, under the affected mamma, and through the axilla of the same side ; from this point con- duct the roller transversely around the chest, covering the lowest por- tion of the gland in its course. Con- tinue making oblique turns of the shoulder and axilla, alternating with circular turns of the chest, each of the respective turns overlapping the upper part of the preceding by about one-third, till the affected breast is completely covered by oblique and circular turns.

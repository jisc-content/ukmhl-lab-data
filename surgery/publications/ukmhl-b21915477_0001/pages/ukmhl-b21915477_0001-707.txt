Amputation above the Shoulder. This operation, which consists in removing at the same time the entire arm together with part or all of the scapula, and perhaps a portion of the clavicle, appears to have been first performed by Cuming, in 1808, though the famous case of the miller, Samuel Wood, whose arm and scapula were torn off by a rope becoming wound around his limb, and who recovered without any bad symptoms, occurred in 1737, and had long been familiar to surgeons.2 R’o universally applicable directions can be given for the performance of this operation, the surgeon, in cases of injury, being compelled to use for his flaps ■whatever tissues are sufficiently sound for the purpose, and the lines of in- cision varying, in operations for tumors of the part, in accordance with the size and shape of the particular growth concerned. Lisfrane’s advice appears to be judicious; that the arm should be first disarticulated, and the axillary vessels secured, and that the scapula should be removed subsequently. This bone may be readily exposed by either a crucial or a T-shaped incision, and its detachment effected, as advised by Fergusson and Pollock, by cutting from below upwards. Separation from the clavicle may be accomplished 1 Besides the five cases tabulated above, I have twice (unsuccessfully) amputated at the shoul- der-joint synchronously with other major amputations.

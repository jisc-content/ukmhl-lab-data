(551) AMPUTATIONS. BY JOHN ASHHUHST, Jr., M.H., PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL SURGERY IN TIIE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA. The word Amputation, from the Latin am- or ambi- (Greek a^t), signifying “ around,” or “ round-about,” and puto, from the root pu (to cleanse) signi- fying to “ clean” or “ cleanse,” and particularly to “ trim” or “ prune” trees or vines, from its etymological meaning might properly be applied to any operation the object of which was to remove an offending part from the rest of the body, and thus might be made to include such diverse procedures as the removal of tumors, the excision of joints, and the extraction of cataract, as well as the dismemberments, partial or complete, to which it is now habitually limited. Indeed, it was not uncommon, a few years ago, for sur- geons to refer to the operation for removal of the female breast, as an ampu- tation of that part, and we still speak of amputations of the penis and of the cervix uteri; but, with these exceptions, the term is now confined to opera- tions for removing the whole or part of one of the limbs, and, when we read or speak of “ an amputation,” we understand that the taking away of a part or the whole of either the upper or the lower extremity is referred to, and that the operation has, as far as it has gone, been a total removal, sparing nothing beyond the line of section. Amputation, the “ last resource of surgery,” as Velpeau called it, is often spoken of by the public, and even by some unthinking physicians, as the opprobrium of our art; and it is said, very justly,that to have saved one limb is more credit to the surgeon than to have removed, no matter how skilfully, a hundred. It is true that, in a certain sense, the advice to a patient to have a limb amputated, must be regarded as a confession of failure—failure, that is, to be able to effect a cure by other modes of treatment; but apart from those cases of supreme urgency in which the victim of disease or injury is called upon to choose between mutilation and certain death—when, as Vel- peau significantly remarks, he will probably choose rather to live with three limbs than to die with four—there may be many circumstances under which the surgeon will feel justified in recommending, and the patient will not hesitate in accepting, an amputation, which, though not essential for the preservation of his life, may afford the only reasonable prospect of placing the patient in a condition such as to render that life either agreeable to him- self or useful to others. And it may be observed that, while on the one hand the improvements in modern surgery have removed from the field of amputation many cases in which the operation would formerly have been considered imperative, yet on the other hand, since the introduction of sur- gical anaesthesia and of improved methods of treating wounds, the operation of amputation itself is a much less dreadful one than it was in the early part of the present century, and may therefore be properly resorted to in many cases which would formerly have been abandoned as hopeless, and left with-

63 DEGENERATION OF THE TISSUES. material as a modified mucin, representing a transition from mucin to muco-peptone. Wurtz examined the gelatin from a colloid cancer of the lung ; it was insoluble in water, and by evaporating to dryness was converted into a white laminated mass, which gave, after extraction with alcohol and ether, a white powder that in turn again swelled into gelatin. Potassa and soda lye dissolved the gelatin, and acetic acid precipitated it from solution. An elementary analysis of the dry substance gave 48.09 per cent, of carbon, 7.47 per cent, of hydrogen, 7 per cent, of nitrogen, 37.44 per cent, of oxygen. This composition varies considerably from that of all known albuminous bodies ; it approaches the composition of chitin. It is probable that the colloid material can be converted into mucus.

The fact that the gravity of amputation increases as the trunk is ap- proached, is also seen by comparing the results of amputations in different parts of the thigh; the following are the death-rates given by Macleod and Legouest for operations in the upper, middle, and lower thirds respectively:— Macleod. Legouest. Amputations in the upper third of the thigh .... 86.8 87.2 “ “ middle “ “ ... 55.3 58.5 “ “ lower “ “ .... 50.0 55.0 Apart from the proximity to the trunk, the particular part of the hone which is divided in an amputation, exercises an influence on the result of the operation, suppurative osteomyelitis and consequent pyoemia being more apt to folloAv when the medullary cavity of a long bone is laid open, than when only the cancellous structure is involved. Thus -of 295 cases of pyaemia following amputation, referred to by Otis,14155, or more than 52 per cent., were after amputation through the shaft of the femur. 1 Archives Generales de Medecine, Avril, 1842, pp. 402-411. 2 Bulletin de l’Academie Imperiale de Medecine, t. xxvii. p. 591, and Legouest, Traite de Chirurgie d’Armee, pp. 722-736.

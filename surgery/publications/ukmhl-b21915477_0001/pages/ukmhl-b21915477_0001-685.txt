625 MORTALITY AND CAUSES OF DEATH AFTER AMPUTATIONS. cases, however, from St. George’s Hospital,1 there were 76 deaths from pj’oe- mia (existing in one case before the operation), a mortality of 48.1 per cent, of fatal cases, or 15.2 per cent, of all amputated. At the Massachusetts General Hospital,2 692 cases have given 42 deaths from pyaemia (23.8 per cent, of fatal cases, or 6.4- per cent, of all amputated), and at the Boston City Hospital,3 296 cases have given 23 deaths from pyaemia (21.2 per cent, of fatal cases, and 7.7 per cent, of all amputated). My own table gives a mortality from pyaemia of but 14.3 per cent, of fatal cases, and but 4 per cent, of all amputated. Table showing the Mortality from Pyemia after Amputation. Total cases.

Malgaigne,5 and by Dr. Addinell Hewson, of Philadelphia,6 whose conclusions have been already referred to by Dr. Brinton on page 461 of the present volume. It will be sufficient, therefore, in this place, to mention that amputations performed while the barometer was falling were found to be two-and-a-half times as fatal as those performed while the barometer was rising, and that while the thermometer ranged above the mean annual temperature, the mortality was greater than that when it was below, in the proportion of nearly seven to six. M. Malgaigne’s investigations led him to believe that for adults, winter, and for children, summer, was the most favorable season. There remain to be considered those conditions which are peculiar to am- putation as distinguished from other operations, viz., the nature of the lesion, the period of amputation, and the part of the body concerned. Hature of Lesion.—Amputations for disease are, as a rule, more successful than those for injury; amputations for malignant disease or for acute disease are more fatal than those performed for chronic disease, such as caries, necrosis, or chronic suppurative arthritis. Amputations for deformity, again, are less successful than those for other non-traumatic causes. In order to show the comparative mortality of amputations for injury and of those for disease, I have compiled the following table from published statistics of French, Eng- lish, and American surgeons. 1 St. George’s Hospital Reports, vols. i. and viii. 2 Chadwick, Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. lxxxvi., 1871.

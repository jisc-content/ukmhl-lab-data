MINOR SURGERY. 490 left thigh, or to the inner side of the right, as the case may be; tlience around the thigh, obliquely upwards, crossing the preceding turn, and around the body. Continue these turns around the thigh and abdomen, either in an as- cending or a descending order as regards the thigh, till the roller is exhausted. Each turn around the thigh should overlap that immediately preceding by one-third of its width. If the intersection of the turns on the anterior surface of the thigh and the groin be from above downwards, a descending spica will be formed; if they be in the reverse direction, that is, from below upwards, an ascending spica will be made.

Groins.â€”Two rollers, each 74 centimetres (3 yards) long. This bandage is begun like the preceding, by two circular turns above the ilia, after which a spica turn is made, as above de- scribed, first on one thigh and then on the other, either in an ascending or a descending series.

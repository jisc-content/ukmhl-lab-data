AMPUTATIONS. 642 obtained without formally dissecting and turning up the cuff, but. under opposite circumstances this must be done, and it will then be convenient to slit the cuff" by a longitudinal incision on the outer side. When the muscles are divided, it will be found that the biceps retracts much more than the others; hence,unless this have been purposely cut long, a second sweep of the knife should be made, to insure that all are severed upon the same level. Six Amputation of tiie Arm. The humerus is placed so nearly in the middle of the arm, that, in this situation, an excellent covering, both of skin and muscle, can be obtained by any mode of amputating that the surgeon happens to fancy. My own preference, in arm amputations, is for the circular operation, plain or modi- fied, or for the oval method. The arm, however, is often considered the typical locality for the employment of the double flap method, and I have myself, on more than one occasion, adopted with advantage the rectangular flap method of the late Mr. Teale. If the arm is to be amputated near the shoulder, there may not be sufficient space for the adjustment of the tourni- quet in the usual manner. Under these circumstances, if the limb be drawn out at a right-angle with the body, so as to make the head of the humerus project into the armpit, the axillary artery may be readily controlled by applying a rather thick and broad compress, and placing the tourniquet plate over the acromion process of the scapula; or compression may be made upon the subclavian artery, where it crosses the first rib, by means of a wrapped key entrusted to a careful assistant. Circular Method.—This is the operation to which I give the preference in amputating at or below the middle of the arm. (See Fig. 146, page 581.) If the limb be slender, sufficient retraction of the skin can ordinarily be Fig. 176. Amputation of left arm by oval or Guthrie’s method.

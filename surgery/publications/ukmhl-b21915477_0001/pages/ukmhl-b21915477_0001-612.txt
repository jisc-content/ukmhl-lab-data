AMPUTATIONS. 556 Plymouth, in England, as described in liis “ Currus Triumphalis e terebintho,” published in 1679.1 Morel’s apparatus consisted of a thick compress, which was placed around the limb, and surrounded with a cord or small rope, under which were slipped two short sticks, by twisting which the cord was Fig. 101. Morel’s tourniquet. (After Dionis.) Fig. 102. Morel’s tourniquet improved. “The common tourniquet.” (After Heister.) drawn very tight2 (Fig. 101). Morel’s tourniquet was improved by Le Dran3 and other surgeons (Fig. 102) by placing an additional pad immediately over the vessels and below the circular compress, by using only one stick for twisting the cord, and by placing beneath this a piece of paste-hoard—or, according to Garengeot,4 of horn or leather (Fig. 103)—so as to render the pressure on the skin less severe, and thus avoid the risk of sloughing, which sometimes followed the use of Morel’s instrument. But the greatest im- provement in the tourniquet was that made in 1718 by the illustrious J. L. Petit5 (Fig. 104)—le grand Petit, as he has been sometimes called to distin- guish him from other less famous surgeons of the same name—and though, with its wooden plates and screw, we should think it but a rude contrivance, it was in all essential points the same instrument as the tourniquet employed at the present day. As soon as surgeons had begun to emancipate themselves from the Hippo- cratic and Galenic doctrine of cutting only dead tissues, it was natural that they should adopt the Celsian method, and we accordingly find that the circu- lar mode of amputation was practised at an earlier period than any of the flap operations. The first important modification introduced into the pro- cedure of Celsus, was the suggestion, about the same time and apparently independently of each other, by Petit,6 in France, and by Cheselden,7 in Eng- 1 Sharp’s Critical Enquiry into the present state of Surgery, page 277.

Dionis does not mention Morel’s name, but says that the tourniquet was invented “ a long time ago, during the seige of Besancjon,” by “one of the surgeons of the army;” and adds that it has been used ever since. 3 Traite des operations de chirurgie, p. 555.

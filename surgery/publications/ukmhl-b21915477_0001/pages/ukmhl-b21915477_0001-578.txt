522 MINOR SURGERY. lysis means chemical decomposition by electricity, and the term is applied in surgery chiefly to the decomposition by means of this agent of tumors, exu- dations, or other morbid products. Electro- or galvano-cautery is the process of cauterizing or burning tissues by means of a wire, or other metallic instru- ment, which has been heated by electricity. Strictly speaking, galvano- cautery is not an electrical operation; electricity is simply used to heat the instrument with which the cauterization is performed. The terms electro- puncture and galvano-puncture refer to electrolysis, to the plunging of needles into a part through which an electric current is made to pass. Electrolysis.â€”For electrolysis, a suitable battery, and needle electrodes of special shapes, are required. The apparatus generally preferred is a galvanic or continuous-current battery of a considerable number of cells of medium size; some form of zinc-carbon batteiy of thirty or more cells. The fluid that will probably be found most serviceable is the well-known solution of potas- sium bichromate. Almost any of the constant batteries, however, which are employed in the treatment of diseases of the nervous and muscular systems, can be made use of in this operation. Fig. 92 represents an improved, portable, Fig. 92. Constant galvanic battery. constant galvanic battery, manufactured by Messrs. Flemming and Talbot, of Philadel] hia. This battery contains thirty cells; others ranging as high as sixty cells are made. Electrolysis has been resorted to with more or less suc- cess in the treatment of aneurism, tumors, and conditions dependent upon old inflammatory deposits The forms of tumor that have been treated electri- cally are naevi, goitres, polypi, cysts, hydatids, fibroids, epitlieliomata, scir- rhous cancers, etc.

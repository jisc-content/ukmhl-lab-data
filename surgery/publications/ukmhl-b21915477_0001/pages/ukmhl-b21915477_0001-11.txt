(v) PREFACE. The object of this work is to furnish, in a comprehensive and yet not unduly extended form, a Systematic and Practical Treatise upon all those subjects which are properly considered to pertain to the Science and Art of Surgery, the various topics discussed in the several volumes having been intrusted to distinguished writers of various countries, who are believed to be specially qualified to give authoritative instruction, each upon the particular subject which he has undertaken. The general plan of the work is as follows :â€” In the First Volume are embraced such subjects as may be looked upon as belonging to General Surgery, including Inflammation, regarded both from the position of the Pathological Histologist, and from that of the Clinical Observer and Practical Surgeon; Erysipelas and Pyaemia; Hydrophobia and Glanders; Scrofula and Tubercle; Rachitis, and Scurvy. Articles follow upon the Reciprocal Effects of Constitutional Conditions and Injuries; upon the General Principles of Surgical Diagnosis; upon Operative Surgery in General; upon Plastic and upon Minor Surgery; upon the use of Anaesthetics; upon Shock; upon Traumatic Delirium and Delirium Tremens; and upon Amputations. In the Second Volume will be begun the study of Special Surgery, those affections being first considered which, though local in themselves, may yet be met with in any part of the body. The Volume will also contain articles upon the several varieties of Venereal Disease, and will begin the discussion of Injuries and Diseases of the Various Tissues of the body.

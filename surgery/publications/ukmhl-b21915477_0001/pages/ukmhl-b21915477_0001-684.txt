AMPUTATIONS. 624 among 507 cases tabulated by Dr. Steele,1 2 from the records of Guy’s Hospital, while the mortality of the whole number was 34.5 per cent., the death-rate among 383 patients from London and its suburbs, was 35.7 per cent.; and that among 124 patients from country districts, only 30.6 per cent.

And there can be no doubt that, as long ago pointed out by Dr. Chevers,3 in a large proportion of cases which prove fatal from internal inflammations (under which name our predecessors included what we now recognize as cases of pyaemia and septicaemia), previously existing visceral disease is present, and not only renders the patient peculiarly susceptible to the influence of these affections, but renders their course much more surely fatal than it would be if they occurred in a healthy subject.4 My own ex- perience agrees entirely with that of Mr. Holmes,5 that erysipelas and hospital gangrene, or, as it might better be called, sloughing phagedoma, are so rarely the cause of death after amputation that they may practically be disregarded. Pyaemia, though more often recognized, is, I have no doubt, really a less frequent cause of death after amputation than it Avas when the principles of hygiene were less regarded in the construction and management of both hos- pitals and private houses, than they are at present. It is still, hoAvever, a very frequent cause of death. In Mr. Bryant’s statistics, presented to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, in 1859,6 the deaths from pytemia after amputation at Guy’s Hospital Avere 33 in number, a mortality of 43.4 per cent, of fatal cases, and 11 per cent, of all cases amputated; but in Dr. Steele’s table of amputations in the same hospital from 1861 to 1868,7 the mortality from the same cause is registered as but 32.7 per cent, of fatal cases, though 12.8 per cent, of all amputated, and in the cases tabulated in the same gentleman’s successive annual reports from 1869 to 1878,8 the ’mortality from this source is but 23.1 per cent, of fatal cases, and but 7.6 per cent, of all amputated. In Mr. Callender’s 358 cases from St. Bartholo- mew’s Hospital,9 there were 20 deaths from pyaemia, a mortality of 27 per cent, of fatal cases, or 5.5 per cent, of all amputated.

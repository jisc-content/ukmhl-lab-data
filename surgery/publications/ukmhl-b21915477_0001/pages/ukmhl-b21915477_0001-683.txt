623 MORTALITY AND CAUSES OF DEATH AFTER AMPUTATIONS. 6 St. Bartholomew’s Hospital Reports, vol. v. p. 249. from French hospitals at a later period, the male mortality was 48.2 per cent., and the female but 35.5 per cent. The same thing is shown, on a smaller scale, by my own Table—the mortality in the male sex having been 28.5 per cent., and in the female sex only 22.2 per cent. But in St. Bartholo- mew’s Hospital,1 and in the Pennsylvania Hospital2 (where, however, compa- ratively few women have submitted to amputation), the mortality has been larger among them than in persons of the male sex.

It was no doubt owing to a positive disregard of ordinary hygienic precautions that amputation was formerly such a fatal operation in the Parisian Hospitals, when, according to tne statis- tics of Malgaigne3 and Trelat,4 almost every other patient who lost a limb died. But more than this, not only do the surroundings of the patient at the time of, and after the operation, greatly influence the result, but the circum- stances under which he has been placed before the operation have likewise a very decided influence in determining its favorable or unfavorable issue. Some years since, the late Sir J. Y. Simpson, in his papers on Hospitalism,5 col- lected a large number of statistics, and by them proved to his own satisfac- tion, if not to that of others, that the mortality after amputation in city hos- pitals was about four times as large as in country practice; but the fact is that patients who have lived in the country, do better after amputations than the inhabitants of cities, even in city hospitals—so that the question again turns upon the constitutional condition of the individual patient, as influ- enced by the circumstances of his past life, rather than upon anything special to the operation itself, or even to the particular building in which it is per- formed. This point may be illustrated by the figures given by the late Mr. Callender,6 of the results of amputations practised by Sir James Paget and himself during the years 1861—1869: while the whole number of cases was 97, with a mortality of 29.8 per cent., the operations on city patients numbered 68, with a mortality of 35.3 per cent., whereas those on country patients numbered 29, with a mortality of only 17.2 per cent.

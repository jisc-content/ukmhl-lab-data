SYMPTOMS OF DELIRIUM TREMENS. 397 Delirium Tremens and Mania a Potu.—It is important to distinguish be- tween delirium tremens proper, and that wild, acute delirium, which is the result of a grand “ spree,” the delirium ebriosorum, the true 'mania a jjotu. The surgeon often meets with these cases, as wounds of all kinds are not unfre- quently received during the debauch. All stages are exhibited by these patients, from the “ remorse that weeps, to the rage that roars.” They mostly require to be kept from injuring themselves and others, until the immediate effects of the overdoses of alcohol are over, when there is rarely any difficulty in taking care of them. Below is a chart (Fig. 33) of a case of this kind. Temperature chart of H. M., aged 35. Mania a potu after scalds of face, neck, scalp, fore- arms, hands and ankles. This patient was doing very well, though with high temperature, until twenty-four hours before his death, when, his friends having poisoned him with very bad whiskey which they had smuggled into the hospital, he was attacked with mania a potu, and, after a night and a day of the most acute, active delirium, died from exhaustion. The treatment consisted in the administration of large doses of bromide of potassium, chloral hydrate, and sul- phate of morphia. The cause given, the suddenness of the attack, and the nature of the injuries, also themselves prone to produce delirium, mark it as one of true mania a potu. The chart points almost with certainty to the time when the smuggled whiskey begun its work of death. The rise of temperature was steady, the attack furious, and the termination rapidly fatal.

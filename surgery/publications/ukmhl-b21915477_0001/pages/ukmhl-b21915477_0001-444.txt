A., aged 67. Traumatic delirium following amputation of hand for machine injury. Treatment consisted in the administration of 20 grains of bromide of potassium with 5 drops of the tincture of digitalis every four hours, and the hypodermic injection of a quarter of a grain of morphia at night. Recovery. patient was rational in the daytime. Throughout, the wound was doing well, and a rapid recovery ensued. Such favorable progress of lacerated wounds is not, however, always to he looked for, when as high temperatures as 104° F. are found to exist. One would reasonably fear an excess of inflam- matory action, which might be followed by gangrene. The sudden rise in the above case is a matter of note, for, instead of being alarming, it, with the delirium, simply pointed to the fact that the patient, although an adult, had the susceptibility of a child. There was nothing about the wound to account for it. Lacerated wounds in their ordinary progress may be the causes of true surgical fever, with accompanying delirium.

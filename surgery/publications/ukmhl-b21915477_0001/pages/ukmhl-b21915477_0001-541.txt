THE USE OF BANDAGES. 485 wards, or longitudinally, with the point looking towards the body of the bandage; in either case the point should be buried in the bandage. To Remove a Bandage.—In taking off a bandage, the folds should be care- fully gathered up in a loose mass as the bandage is unwound; this will facilitate the process, and prevent the part from becoming entangled in the loops. Special Bandages. The Circular Bandage.—This consists of a few circular turns around a part, each turn accurately covering in the whole of the pre- ceding. (Fig. 45, a.) Its use is to retain dressings on some part of the vault of the cranium, and on the neck; and to compress the veins above the elbow, as a preliminary step in venesection. The Oblique Bandage.—This bandage is carried by oblique turns up a limb, leaving uncov- ered spaces between the succes- sive turns. It is used to retain temporary dressings. (See Fig. 45, b.) The Spiral Bandage.—The turns of this bandage are carried around a part in a spiral direc- tion, with each turn overlapping a portion of the preceding, usu- ally one-tliird or one-half. (See Fig. 45, c.) This bandage is used for all the purposes for which that to be next de- scribed is employed, on parts the dimensions of which do not vary. The Spiral Reversed Band- age.—This bandage differs from the preceding in hav- ing its turns foldecl back, or reversed, as it ascends a limb the diameter of which grad- ually increases. This modi- fication of the spiral is of the utmost importance, for with it spiral turns can be applied to a limb conical in shape, so as to make equable pres- sure on all parts of the sur- face. Reverses may he form- ed in the following manner: After the initial extremity of a roller is made fast by a couple of circular turns, the roller is carried off ten or Fig. 45. a circular, b oblique, and c spiral turns of bandage.

666 AMPUTATIONS. lower surface of the patella is removed with a small saw,1 and the condyles similarly divided through their base, the two sawn surfaces being then brought into apposition. A very good stump results from this rather complicated procedure. Stokes’s Modification of Gritti’s Amputation is called by its author, Dr. W. Stokes,2 of Dublin, a supra-condyloid amputation of the thigh, whereas the line of section in Gritti’s method is trans-condyloid. This operation differs from that of the Italian surgeon simply in the fact that the anterior flap is oval instead of beiug rectangular; that the posterior flap is made somewhat larger (one third the length of the anterior); and that the femur is sawn through half an inch above the condyles, instead of through their base. The freshly sawn surfaces of the femur and patella are brought together as in the Italian opera- tion, and fixed by means of a catgut suture passed through the soft tissues immediately behind the bone, and with both ends cut short and left in the wound. The merits of these various forms of operation have been investigated by numerous surgeons, among whom I may particularly mention Profs. Stephen Smith3 and Markoe,4 and Dr. R. F. Weir,6 of Few York ; Dr. J. H. Brinton,6 of Philadelphia; Mr. Pollock,7 of London; and Dr. Salzmann,8 of Potsdam, who has particularly studied Gritti’s method in regard to its applicability in military practice. Dr. Brinton, including in his Tables Prof. Markoe’s and Dr. Otis’s cases, refers in all to 494 examples of these different operations, death having followed in 207 ; Dr. Weir tabulates 76 cases (of Gritti’s and Stokes’s operations) with 22 deaths; Mr. Pollock 48 cases of various kinds with 13 deaths ; while Dr. Salzmann collects, in all, 396 cases with 231 deaths. In the following Table I have included only terminated cases, and have taken care to avoid duplication in combining the statistics of the various authors quoted.

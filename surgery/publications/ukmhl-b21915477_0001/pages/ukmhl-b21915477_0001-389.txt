333 PREGNANCY. gestation in several ways: by provoking abortion or premature delivery ; by causing the death of the mother with or without that of the child, and either before or after that of the child. The normal termination of the pregnancy, that is to say the reciprocal independence of the traumatism and of the pregnancy, may be foreseen and announced: when the wound is remote from the genital apparatus; when it affects healthy tissues; when it is slight, simple, and not complicated pri- marily or consecutively by any accident capable of transforming the wounded person into a sick one; and when, on the other hand, the uterus, the foetus, and its annexes, are anatomically and physiologically normal, and when the ma- ternal organism, which has been suddenly subjected to the injury, is sound or nearly so, that is to say free from all constitutional disease existing either before or after fecundation, and when it remains so afterwards. The injurious influence of traumatism upon pregnancy and the various ter- minations which follow, may, in turn, be foreseen and declared: when the wound affects the foetus and its annexes, the uterus, and the other organs pertaining to the genital sphere, and when these parts are, in advance, altered in various ways ; when the wound is extensive or grave in itself, or when it affects organs essential to the life of the mother ; when the mother has suf- fered, before the reception of the wound, from a constitutional morbid condi- tion, or from a circumscribed affection which renders abortion possible and probable; or when some complication starts from the wound or its immediate neighborhood, and is at all events capable of weakening, shattering, or poi- soning the maternal or foetal organisms. We may hope for and declare the favorable, though indirect, action of sur- gical traumatism upon pregnancy, when, by the aid of even a serious opera- tion, we can succeed in removing an affection which is still more dangerous to mother and child. The aggravation of certain morbid conditions in the pregnant woman is explained by the general or local modifications which pregnancy produces in the circulation, in nutrition, in the composition of the blood, and in the gene- sis of anatomical elements; and in the same manner is explained the favor- able action of delivery, which suppresses various pathogenetic causes. We can understand the hurtful effect of the puerperal condition upon trauma- tism contracted after delivery, if we take into consideration the conditions then presented by the injuries which, in fact, often involve tissues that are altered, or profoundly modified in their structure and properties; indi- viduals already wounded by the mere fact of the uterine trauma; women already sick in consequence of pregnancy itself or of the constitutional condi- tions which may be associated with it. Whenever a woman, during the period of fecundity, is wounded accidentally or as the result of a surgical operation, we should always determine whether she is in a condition of preg- nancy or not. In the former event, Ave should note with extreme care, imme- diately after the injury or before the operation, the organic conditions of the mother, the state of her genital apparatus, and that of the product of concep- tion. In case of an accidental injury, the local and general treatment should be directed to moderating or preventing the direct or indirect, disastrous effects of the wound upon the genital apparatus ; to maintaining the patient in, or restoring her to, the condition of one Avho is simply wounded, and to prevent her from being changed into one who is sick ; to palliating or com- bating every injurious effect of pregnancy upon the reparative process; in a word, to preventing abortion. When abortion occurs, we should watch the wound to ward off any possible aggravation, and the uterus to prevent the septicaemia of which it is sometimes the starting-point and the seat.

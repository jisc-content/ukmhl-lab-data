282 SCURVY* Scurvy appeared in 1681 in the Swedish Army at Nuremberg,1 and again in 1633 in Augsburg, and at the close of the century (1699) at the Hotel Dicu, Paris. These examples serve to show how little advantage had been taken of the knowledge already gained of the causative influences determin- ing the disease. In fact, the treatises that appeared at this time were inferior to those of the preceding century, and the most notable example was the book of Engalenus,2 published in 1604, which, from the great esteem in which it was held for more than a century, served to disseminate the most absurd views concerning the pathology of scurvy. Scarcely an ailment was attributed to other than scorbutic influences, and certain peculiarities of the pulse and urine were regarded as the most certain and characteristic signs of their presence. This confusion—created first by Engalenus, and further extended by other writers who had adopted his opinions, such as Sennertus,3 "Willis,4 and Lister5—induced not a few to doubt, and even to deny, the existence of scurvy as a distinct affection. The eighteenth century, however, furnished the most marked examples of the devastation produced by scurvy, commencing with the siege of Thorn6 by the Swedes, in 1703, in which 5000 of the garrison, besides many of the inhabitants, were destroyed by the disease, while the besiegers were abso- lutely exempt from it. When the investment ended, and succulent vegetables were permitted to enter the town, the disease quickly disappeared. It also occurred in Cronstadt,7 Yiborg, and St. Petersburg,8 between 1731 and 1738, when thousands of common soldiers were cut off, but not a single officer suffered. The disease was so widespread and fatal that Kramer,9 physician to the army, requested a consultation of the College of Physicians of Vienna. Their advice was, however, of no avail, for the disease, which had broken out at the end of winter, continued until the approach of summer, when succulent vegetables were procurable. Of four hundred cases treated with calomel, every one died. At the siege of Azof,10 in 1736, the Prussians suf- fered severely, as did also the Russian Army, in 1742, at Viborg and other places. The malady was greatest during the winter and spring, and was ascribed to the unwholesome character of the food, and the want of fresh succulent vegetables. The dreadful misfortune of Admiral Hosier, who commanded the English fleet in the "West Indies in 1728, presents an example of tragic interest: he lost two crews from the disease, and in consequence died himself, broken-hearted; and, a little later, the fleet of Admiral Rodney, on the same station, suffered severely. In 1740, Lord Anson left England with a squadron tw circumnavigate the globe, and, after the most harrowing experiences from tempest and scurvy, returned with less than a fifth of his original force. The disease was fatally rife, though the men were abundantly supplied with fresh animal food. The fleet under the command of Admiral Geary, in 1780, returned to England with 2400 cases of scurvy, and the Channel fleet under Lord Howe was completely disabled from the same cause. In 1749-50, the disease reigned in Friesland, and at Riga, Breslau, and Venice; and the British troops, 5000 in number, as related by Smollett,11 were at the siege of Quebec, in 1760, so distressed by want of vegetables and the ex- cessive cold, that before the end of April 1000 men died of scurvy, and more 1 Rotenbeck et Horn, Specul. scorbuti.

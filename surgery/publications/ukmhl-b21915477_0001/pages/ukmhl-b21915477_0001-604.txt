II. W. Meyer, who reported two cases in 1877.1 Skin grafting was now practised in all parts of North America. In Canada, in 1871, in the proceedings of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, of Montreal, we find that Dr. W. H. Kingston evoked discussion upon a paper on skin graft- ing, accompanied with cases.2 In Baltimore, Prof. J. J. Chisolm3 practised skin grafting publicly, and advocated the employment of grafts obtained from the deeper parts; in California, Prof. II. W. Poland recorded a case of skin grafting practised by him in 1873 ;4 and in 1874, Prof. D. Hayes Agnew,5 of Philadelphia, published cases and remarks upon ulcers and skin grafting, reported favorably upon the process, and proposed to supply skin from a portion of the body corresponding to the diseased part, as promising more success. It were invidious, almost, to withhold the names of the surgeons who made early application of the new process of inducing cicatrization, but the limits of this article forbid the enumeration. We may, however, refer to Dr. How- ard’s6 investigation of “muscle grafting,” which he believed to disprove the “ epithelium theory;” to Dr. M. Donnelly’s7 paper, with cases, on skin grafting as practised in St. Vincent’s Hospital; to that of Dr. W. F. Cheney,8 with cases, in 1872; to the paper and cases of Dr. E. L. Wemple9 in 1873 ; to the contribution of Dr. J. W. Trader,10 in the Medical Archives of St. Louis, re- lating to a railroad injury in which, after sloughing of the crushed foot, skin grafting was happily resorted to; to the Bellevue Hospital report,11 in 1873, of the method of setting grafts, referring to the setting of two thousand grafts; to a case of Dr. B. M. Cromwell,12 with comments, reported in 1875 ; and finally to Prof. S. G. Maclean’s successful treatment of a large ulcer by simple measures and skin grafting. Before concluding this article, I purpose to briefly review the opinions entertained with regard to the preferable size of the grafts, and begin by stating, on his own authority, that Reverdin always adhered to the small grafts with which he inaugurated his system, and that Mr. Pollock was, in the main, likewise minded. Nevertheless, we find M. Ollier,13 in 1872, saying that, instead of grafts, little morsels of two, three, or four millimetres square are preferably used, “ as is practised by M. Reverdin.” And further on, Ollier adduces his favorable experiences with grafts of large size, of four, six, or eight square centimetres, involving the entire dermis,and constituting “a veritable autoplasty;” and expatiates upon the necessity of immobility in the parts sub- mitted to operation, adding that this is best secured by a silicated apparatus. At first he employed epidermic grafts, then dermo-epidermic grafts of one or two centimetres’ extent, and finally grafts of skin and cellular tissue; all in one patient, to procure cicatrization after a large burn. He observed, how- 1 Chicago Med. Journal and Examiner, vol. xxxiv. p. 320, 1877. 2 Canada Med. Journal, vol. vii. p. 495. Montreal, 1871. 3 Richmond and Louisville Med.

367 PATHOLOGY OF SHOCK. such phenomena as are presented in shock can only be produced by the sus- pension of the nervous power manifesting itself through the circulation, have found their clearest proof in the facts of physiology ; and it may be taken as demonstrated- beyond dispute, that in shock there is a reflex paralysis of the heart and the abdominal vessels. There are facts, however, which show that its action cannot be limited to these alone, but must, as might be expected from what has been said above, be extended over the whole vascular system, if not even, as Brown-Sequard has suggested, over the relation that exists normally between the blood in the capillaries and the tissues around them. For the symptoms of shock are not identical with those of hemorrhage, as under these circumstances they probably would be ; and, although dilatation of the abdominal vessels leading to passive congestion bas been noticed (as, for example, occasionally during ovariotomy), it does not reach, if we may trust post-mortem records of fatal cases, that extreme degree necessary to account for the symptoms. Further, Tappeiner1 has shown, by ligaturing the portal vein and then estimating the amount of blood contained in its radicles, that even in mammals, such as rabbits, with relatively large abdo- minal viscera, contrarily to the generally received opinion, all the vessels of the abdomen, veins and arteries together, are not of sufficient capacity to hold more than sixteen per cent, of the total amount of blood in the animal’s body —a quantity, as long as the other bloodvessels preserve their innervation intact, quite unable to cause such a loss of pressure; for Muller2 demonstrated that, as long as the vasomotor nerves retained their power, the total amount of circulating blood might be halved or doubled without producing any appreciable- difference. The same result is arrived at after section of the splanchnic nerves on both sides: by doing this, all the vessels of the abdo- minal viscera are completely cut off from their vasomotor nerves, and dis- tended to the utmost by the blood stagnating in them (for it does not seem likely that active dilatation can ever take place; the nerve-supply is doubt- ful, and the muscular mechanism in the walls unknown); yet by actual measurement, with a manometer, of the arterial tension after this has been done, it is found that the fall is never equal to, and in the majority of cases not half as great as, that which must occur in a case of hemorrhage if the symptoms are comparable in their severity to those of an ordinary case of shock.3 Indeed, so far is the general arterial tension from falling below the point consistent with the maintenance of life, that animals in which this has been done on both sides simultaneously, have been known to make a thor- oughly good recovery—the local centres assuming the function which the medulla and spinal cord are no longer able to carry out, and the vessels grad- ually resuming their calibre and regular tone.4 From these experiments it is legitimate to infer that something further is necessary ; and Fischer is probably correct in stating that in shock there is paralysis of the whole vasomotor system, that of the splanchnics being, on account of their peculiar distribution, the most marked. As the vessels have been shown to be all under the control of the same nerve-centre, it must be admitted that there is nothing improbable in this; and it certainly affords a reasonable explanation (through the stagnation of venous blood in the capil- laries) of the lividity of the skin and all the visible parts, so different from the waxy pallor of hemorrhage. There are a few facts that point to the possibility in some cases of different parts of the vascular system being affected in different degrees. Goltz, in his experiments, sometimes found that the heart was very much more interfered with than the vessels; some- 1 Tappeiner, Ludwig’s Arbeiten, Leipzig, 1872. 2 Muller, Ludwig’s Arbeiten, 1874. 3 Tappeiner, loo. cit. 4 Asp, Ludwig’s Arbeiten, 1867.

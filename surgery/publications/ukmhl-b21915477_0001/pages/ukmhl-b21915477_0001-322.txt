RACHITIS. 266 not as .long as tlie left, as the lower ribs on this side are partially supported by the liver. On both sides, however, the lower part of the thorax, that below the seventh, eighth, or ninth ribs, widens, being pressed outward and sup- ported by the abdominal viscera. There is, therefore, in addition to the longi- tudinal groove, an antero-posterior depression, sometimes also spoken of as a furrow or groove, on either side, lying between the sixth and ninth ribs. The ribs with their attached muscles are important agents in respiration, but the soft and yielding nature of the ribs, in the rachitic, retards, and to a great extent prevents, the lateral expansion of the thorax which is necessary for normal and full inspiration. The action of the respiratory muscles, and the pressure from within of the air descending along the air passages, is Fig. 13. Deformity of chest in rachitis. not sufficient to fully overcome the external atmospheric pressure, in the ab- sence of proper resiliency of the ribs. Consequently, with each inspiration, we observe more or less sinking in of the thorax on either side, just as when a moderate obstruction to the entrance of air exists in the larynx or trachea. As the ribs become firmer from the deposit of lime salts, respiration is more regular and normal. Changes in Bones of Upper Extremity.â€”Although swelling of the lower end of the radius (see Fig. 12) is one of the earliest signs of rachitis, the bones of the upper extremities are less frequently curved and distorted than those of the lower extremities. The clavicle sometimes softens and bends, producing two curvatures, one backward, near the scapula, and another of larger size nearer the sternum, directed forward and a little upward. Careful examination shows, in some rachitic patients, thickening of the margins of the scapula, like that of the cranial bones. The humerus is occasionally bent,

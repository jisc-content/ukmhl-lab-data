VOL. i.—1 (1) THE INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF SURGERY. DISTURBANCES OF NUTRITION; THE PATHOLOGY OF INFLAMMATION. BY S. STRICKER, M.D., PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL AND GENERAL PATHOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA. TRANSLATED BY ALFRED MEYER, M.D., OF NEW YORK. Hyperemia. Tiie expression Hypercemia signifies a repletion of the bloodvessels with blood. When, however, the entire circulatory system is overfilled, we desig- nate this condition as Plethora. The term hypersemia has reference only to a certain territory, to a certain organ or portion of an organ. Consequently, when we make use of the word “ hypenemia,” we must add the region in which this overfilling with blood has its seat. We accordingly speak of a liypersemia of the liver, of the kidney, or of the brain; but we do not say that a man is suffering from liypersemia. As soon as the bloodvessels dilate, their contents must increase. On the other hand, hypenemia without dilatation of the bloodvessels is an impossi- bility. Hypersemia and dilatation of bloodvessels are consequently conditions which are intimately connected. If we inject a colored fluid into an organ, we observe that it assumes the color of the injected mass only when the capillaries become filled with the same. If we employ a substance which does not find its way into the capillaries (e. y., cinnabar suspended in wax), only the arteries or veins become colored, according as we have made the injection into the former or into the latter. For the arteries and veins of an organ only form single branches, whereas the capillaries traverse the entire organ, forming a network so dense that we cannot see its meshes with the

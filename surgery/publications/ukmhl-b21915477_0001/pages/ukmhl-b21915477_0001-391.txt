385 OLD AGE. Old Age. Some old people, whom we should rather call aged than old, tolerate trau- matic lesions as well as adults. In others, on the contrary, the reparative process remains imperfect. Interstitial wounds suppurate ; immediate union fails; local inflammations do not remain circumscribed; gangrene attacks the detached and thinned integument; simple fractures unite slowly ; severe contusions are complicated by diffuse phlegmon and sloughing. At other times, the seat of traumatism remains indolent, without tone, and languish- ing ; hut threatening internal inflammations are set up; pneumonia, nephritis, meningo-encephalitis declare themselves, followed by their train of general adynamic or ataxic symptoms, and death promptly ensues. The autopsy almost always reveals a previously existing had condition of the great viscera, which entails the same consequences as in adults. In individuals who are apparently healthy despite advanced age, the organs have sufficed for the needs of a regulated and tranquil life; the traumatism occurs, gives a shock to the economy, stirs up old morbid susceptibilities, and destroys an organi- zation which has only maintained itself in equilibrium, as it were, by accident.

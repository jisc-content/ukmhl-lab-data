I shall illustrate delirium tremens as to its special clinical features in sur- gical cases, by the three following charts (Figs. 34, 35, 36), which may be called typical. Fig. 34.

Diagnosis op Delirium Tremens.—From what has been said, it will be seen that the diagnosis of delirium tremens is generally easy, in spite of the misrepresentations which are made, and the absolute lies, as to habits, which are too apt to be told, both by the patient and his friends. Sometimes all are deceived in the matter, and the attack comes on as a surprise. The patient has only been a moderate drinker, and if the additional and depressing effects of an accident had not occurred, neither himself nor his friends would have even thought of him as a subject for the disease. Therefore, it is but justice to say that patients’ statements, denying drinking habits to any harmful extent, may be given in perfectly good faith. The ideas of people differ so much as to what is harmful in this matter, that it is important for the surgeon to find out if possible what are really the facts of the case, both as to the amount and as to the kind of liquor used.

PROTHETIC APPARATUS AND THE ADAPTATION OF ARTIFICIAL LIMBS. 609 61 es the “ Palmer leg,” and is really a very useful and satisfactory-piece of mechanism. Various ingenious devices have been adapted in order to provide lateral and rotatory, as well as antero-posterior motion at the ankle-joint, those specially worthy of mention being found in the forms of apparatus made respectively by Dr. illy, ot Rochester, Mr. Murks, of IN"ew Y ork, and Mr. Kolbe, of Philadelphia. The peculiarity of the “Bly leg” (Figs. 161, 162), Fig. 1(30. Fig. 162. Mechanism of ankle in the “ Bly” leg. B, glass ball ; C, tendons: G, leg piece. Fig. 161. The “ Bly” leg.

Y., is that the ankle-joint is formed by a ball of polished glass playing in a vulcanite socket, motion being afforded by means of India-rubber “compression” springs, with cords which represent the natural tendons. The “Marks leg”(Fig. 163) dis- penses with a joint altogether, the necessary motion in different directions being provided for by the flexibility and elasticity of the foot itself, which is made of India-rubber surrounding a smaller wooden frame. The “Kolbe leg” (Figs. 164, 165) affords lateral motion at the ankle by giving the steel ankle bolt a globular enlargement at its centre, corresponding to hemispheri- cal depressions in both foot and leg pieces, the ends of the bolt passing loosely through holes in the metal side straps, and being furnished with India-rubber supports so as to permit the necessary movements. vol. i.—39

Putting the figures in another way, the mortality of early is less than that of late operations, nearly in the ratio of two to three, and, comparing this with the preceding Table, it appears that 'primary are as much more successful than other traumatic amputations in civil practice, as amputations for disease are than amputations for injury taken all to- gether. The difference is even more marked than in military practice, as may be seen from the following Table:—

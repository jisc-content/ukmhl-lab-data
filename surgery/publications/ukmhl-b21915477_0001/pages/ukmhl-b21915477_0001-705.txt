AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER, 645 from an amputation by this method is seen in Fig. 178, from a photograph of a lad under my care many years ago at the Episcopal Hospital. Mr. Spence has modified this operation by making the first (longitudinal) incision much longer, as if for excision of the caput humeri, and making the branches of the oval more nearly transverse than in Larrey’s method. External Flap Method.—This method was first described in print by M. Grosbois, who claimed it as his own in a thesis published in 1803, but it is believed by Velpeau, Sedillot, and other French authorities, to have really originated with Dupuytren, whose name it commonly bears, and who, we are told,1 practised it with “great dexterity,” on the occasion of the “concours” for the chair of operative surgery (February 15, 1812).2 It is a modification of the early opera- tion of Le Dran and La Faye. The principal flap is an external, or, more strictly, a postero- external one, which embraces the thickness of the deltoid muscle (Fig. 179). Grasping this part with his left hand, the surgeon enters the point of his Fig. 179. Amputation at left shoulder by external flap, or Dupuytren’s method. Fig. 178.

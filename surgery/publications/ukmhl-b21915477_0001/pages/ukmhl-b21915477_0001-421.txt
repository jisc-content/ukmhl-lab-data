PATHOLOGY OF SHOCK. 365 is still active, though, quite unequal to the higher efforts of intelligence; its power is impaired, not abolished ; and, as in syncope it appears to be the only part of the nervous system (as far as it is admissible to use the expression) affected, so in shock it suffers equally with all the rest; for in the one, the simplest cause that is efficient, is a diminution of the blood pressure within the cranial cavity ; in the other, the only one that can offer any explanation of the symptoms, is a fall in the vascular tension, which is general, extending throughout the whole body. Even when there has been no loss of blood, the lividity and pallor of the skin; the diminution in sensibility; the sluggish- ness of the cerebral functions ; the lessened vigor of contraction and readiness to respond to stimulus, shown by the muscles; the rapidity, smallness of volume, and compressibility of the pulse ; the partial suppression of the secre- tions ; and especially the long continuance of the symptoms, which are not capable of passing off within a few minutes, as in syncopeâ€”all point to some general check to the capillary circulation, and through this to an equally general failure in the arterial tension. Pathology of Shock. It is to experimental physiology alone that must he given the credit of not merely a plausible, but almost certainly the true explanation of the manner in which these changes can take place. It has shown that, while, on the one hand, the heart is so independent of other innervation than that contained within its own walls, for the orderly continuance of its action, that the whole of the great nervous centres may be gradually removed without destroying this; on the other hand, it is so directly under control that not only may irri- tation of a particular nerve running to it bring its movement to an instan- taneous stop, but that even, as long as the connections are intact, the same result may follow reflexly from a stimulus applied to a centripetal nerve. It has shown, further, that the bloodvessels, veins as well as arteries, are under a control so closely resembling this, that it may he brought into action by the same stimulus ; as, indeed, might have been presupposed from the close resemblance which the vessels present to the heart, in their first development. For whether the history of the individual or of the race be contemplated, in the one as in the other, at its first origin, the circulatory apparatus is uniform and simple in structure and relations; only with increasing size and com- plexity of other parts of the body, in accordance with the ordinary principles of the division of labor, does it become itself so complex that at length some divisions attain such a degree of specialization that, they are usually thought of and studied as if they were independent and distinct from the rest. It is true that this similarity in nerve control does not seem at first sight so clear as it might be; for, according to general statements, the vasomotor system is not automatic and not distinct from the central nervous system, but reflex and situated in the medulla oblongata, with a prolongation, as experiment has. recently shown, down the spinal cord; but that the power of independence, comparable to that possessed by the heart, is still retained, though, perhaps, dormant and subordinated, is shown by experiments in which the whole vasomotor supply of some part of the body has been cut off permanently ; at first, the vessels dilate passively, and remain in this condition for some days, perhaps even weeks ; but then they gradually recover their tone, and can con- tract and dilate just as before, but now, of course, only in response to local stimuli. It may be, to use the language of teleology, that for the convenience of the rest of the organism the nerve centres that control the vessels, in place of

AMPUTATIONS. 648 Fig-1S1- either with cutting pliers or with a chain, saw. (Fig. 181.) The gravity of the operation varies, of course, with the extent of hone re- moved ; if this be limited to the acromion, the case is hut little more dangerous than an ordinary shoulder- joint amputation, hut if the whole or greater part of the scapula he taken away, the risk is very much increased. Statistical writers have very com- monly confused this operation with that of excision of the scapula, either without interference with the arm, or subse- quent to previous amputation. This operation will he described in a future volume. The annexed Table contains a summary of fifty-one1 cases to which I have references, which are properly designated as amputations above the shoulder. Chain saw.

There are besides at least 14 cases on record in which recovery has followed accidental avulsion of the arm and part or all of the scapula,2 so that if we should take these figures without allowance, we would conclude that the operation was really one of little risk. It is at least sufficiently suc- cessful to justify the surgeon in resorting to it in suitable cases. 1 Velpeau says that Larrey did this operation “ several times,” and “more than once” with success. (Nouveaux Elements de Medecine Operatoire, t. ii. p. 465.) 2 Dr. Stephen Rogers, of New York, collected twelve cases, in papers in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences for October, 1868, and the New York Medical Journal for December, 1870. A thirteenth case, recorded by Kathaletzky, is noted in the London Medical Record for Dec. 17, 1873, and a fourteenth is reported by Dr. Ellis-Jones, a Welsh surgeon, in the Lancet for Aug. 20, 1881.

344 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL DIAGNOSIS. the physician or the surgeon, as it is only by the possession of such knowledge that he is able to appreciate those deviations which are produced by disease or accident. A flattened shoulder, with a salient acromion process, suggests a luxation of the humerus; a prominence of the spinous processes of one or Fig. 21.

Mode of stooping in a subject of spinal- caries. more vertebrce, indicates the existence of Pottâ€™s disease of the spine; the obliteration of the gluteo-femoral fold raises a suspicion of coxalgia; angular deformity in the continuity of a limb reveals a fracture of its bone or bones; a joint, whose surface depressions and elevations have all been merged in a general swelling, is likely to be filled with fluid; and the obliteration of the intercostal depressions, by the bulging of the tissues between the ribs, indi- cates an empyema or hydrothorax. The form or shape of a swelling will often reveal its exact location. Thus, an enlargement situated under the jaw, the limitations of which are the angle of the inferior maxilla posteriorly, the symphysis of the jaw anteriorly, and the digastric muscle below, will be found to be seated in the submaxillary region; and in like manner, a swelling which is rigidly confined between the spine of the scapula and the upper border of the bone, will in all probability lie beneath the deep fascia and in the supraspinous fossa. As other illustrations under this head, may be men- tioned the acuminated form of an abscess, the pyriform scrotum in hydrocele, the convoluted appearance of varicocele, the frown which settles on the brows in peritonitis from the contraction of the corrugator muscle, the sardonic grin in tetanus, the pinched features of the Hippocratic face, presaging ap- proaching dissolution, and the notched teeth in transmitted syphilis, with many others which might be readily adduced.

422 ANAESTHETICS AND ANAESTHESIA. Anaesthesia by Compression.—-James Moore (1784), and other surgeons since his day, have sought to produce local insensibility sufficient to abolish pain, by compressing the nerves of the part to be operated upon. For this purpose a species of tourniquet has been employed by some, while simple ligation of the member has been proposed by others. Though it is possible thus to produce a certain degree of numbness, the success of the method has been very imperfect, and the whole subject has become a matter of purely historical interest. [Aug. Waller produced muscular relaxation and anaes- thesia by compressing the cervical portions of the pneumogastric nerves.] Mortality consequent upon Artificial Anaesthesia. It is impossible to reach any degree of certainty regarding this matter. The number of administrations since the discovery of Morton cannot be esti- mated, and the number of cases which have resulted fatally cannot be ascer- tained. Hundreds of such cases have been recorded in the medical journals, but many hundred other cases have never been thus reported. All estimates based upon medical literature must, therefore, be regarded as approximations merely. Sufficient, however, is known to enable the surgeon to speak with great assurance regarding the relative dangers which attend the employment of different anaesthetics. Thus, it is certain that chloroform has occasioned the vast majority of deaths which have occurred in connection with artificial anaesthesia. But chloroform has beeu so much more generally employed than any other anaesthetic, that its mortality, other things being equal, should present a figure greater than that of any other substance. In Europe, the vast majority of surgeons have used chloroform alone. It is in America, where ether has been more generally employed, that a comparison of mor- tality is more likely to give definite information. Here, however, complete statistics are wanting. A combination of statistical tables is not likely to give additional information, because many of the reported cases of death are repeated in the different tables, while the sum total of inhalations is largely imaginary. The following estimates may illustrate the present condition of our knowledge on the subject. Dr. J. -J. Chisolm, of Baltimore, estimates (1877) that among over 250,000 recorded administrations of chloroform, only twelve deaths had occurred. But, since over three hundred fatal cases—Dr. Turnbull (1879) gives a total of three hundred and seventy—have been recorded, if these had been added to Dr. Chisolm’s collection, his estimate of the ratio of mortality would have been seriously affected. Prof. E. Andrews, of Chicago (1870), collected 117,078 cases of chloroform inhalation with 43 deaths, giving a ratio of 1 to 2723. Among 92,815 cases of ether inhalation were 4 deaths, giving a ratio of 1 to 23,204. A mixture of chloroform and ether, used in 11,176 cases, caused 2 deaths, giving a ratio of 1 to 5588. Bichloride of methylene, used in 7000 cases, caused one death. Dr. Coles, of Virginia, reported, on the basis of Eng- lish and American statistics, the following figures: Ether, 4 deaths in 92,815 j inhalations; ratio, 1 to 23,204. Chloroform, 52 deaths in 152,260inhalations; ratio, 1 to 2873. Mixture of chloroform and ether, 2 deaths in 11,176 inhala- tions ; ratio, 1 to 5588. Bichloride of methylene, 2 deaths in 10,000 inhalations; ratio, 1 to 5000. Richardson collected from English hospital statistics, between the years 1848 and 1869 inclusive, a report of 35,165 administrations of chlo- roform, with 11 deaths, giving a ratio of 1 to 3196. Squibb has estimated the ratio of deaths by chloroform published in American journals at 1 to 11,764. Assuming that only half the fatal cases are reported, this would give a ratio of 1 to 5882.

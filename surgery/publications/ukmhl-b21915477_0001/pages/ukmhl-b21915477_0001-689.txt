Only twice, in my own experience, have I felt it my duty to resort to intermediate amputation, and in both of these cases the patients succumbed, though perhaps not much sooner than they would have done from the effects of their injuries, complicated as they were by spreading gangrene, had no operation been performed. In military practice the greater gravity of intermediate amputations has been clearly established; thus of the 2182 late operations with 644 deaths, recorded by Dr. Otis, and included in the preceding Table, 1516 were intermediate, with 481 deaths, or 81.7 per cent., and 666 secondary, with 163 deaths, or only 24.4 per cent. Part of the Body Involved.—There remains to be considered the influence on the result of amputation exercised by the loccdity the operation, or, in other words, the particular part of the body in which the amputation is per- formed. In general terms, it may be said that amputations in the lower are more serious than those in the upper extremity, and that the nearer to the trunk is the seat of operation, the greater is the risk to life. To illustrate these points, I have prepared the following Table, in which is compared the mortality of the four principal amputations, those of the thigh, ley, arm, and forearm. , 1 Amputations of upper extremity only.

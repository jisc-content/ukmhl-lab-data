The mortality of amputations for expediency (including both those for deformity and those for tumor), has been particularly investi- gated by Mr. Bryant and Mr. Golding-Bird, at Guy’s Hospital, and their combined statistics13 show that the death-rate in this class of cases was 26.8 per cent., as compared with a death-rate of 21.1 per cent, in those of chronic disease. Among my own 28 cases of amputation for disease, the only ones which proved fatal were acute cases, to wit, two for acute suppurative arthritis of the knee-joint, in adults; one for elephantiasis and sloughing ulcer; and one for popliteal aneurism which had become diffuse. Prof. Spence’s statistics of amputation for disease, which embrace between 300 and 400 cases,14 show that while the mortality of amputation for chronic disease was less than 14 per cent., that of amputation for malignant disease was over 46 per cent., and 1 Archives Generates de Medecine, Mai, 1842, pp. 59, 61. 2 Bulletin de l’Aead^mie Imperiale de Medecine, tome xxvii. p. 591.

637 AMPUTATION AT THE WRIST. Excision may be sometimes substituted for amputation of a metacarpal bone, when the finger itself is not injured, but such an operation is not usu- ally very satisfactory. Prof. Joseph Pancoast has successfully adapted a fin- ger which had lost its metacarpal bone, to another metacarpal bone which had, in turn, lost its finger. After all amputations of the hand, as after those of the fingers, the part should be kept upon a splint until the deep parts of the wound have united. The risk of amputation below the wrist is very slight. I have kept no record of my own finger amputations, but do not recall any which have terminated unfavorably. Thirteen cases of partial amputation of the hand, of which I have notes, all ended in recovery. The following Table exhibits the mortality of these operations in hospital and army practice; the death- rate of finger amputations is seen to be but about one in thirty, and that of amputations through the hand, about one in fifteen.

The whole hand may be removed at the radio-carpal articulation, by either the circular, the elliptical, or some variety of the flap method. The result- ing stump is usually a very good one, and possesses the advantage of allowing the retention of the motions of pronation and supination, but, on the other hand, is said to be less well fitted than a shorter stump for the adaptation of an artificial hand. Circular Method.—The back of the hand and forearm having been shaved, if necessary, and the tourniquet adjusted so as to control the circula- tion through the brachial artery, an assistant grasps the hand and holds it firmly, while the surgeon with his own left hand draws the skin of the fore- arm upwards, and makes his first incision on a level with the carpo-metacar- pal articulation of the thumb and fifth finger, from an inch to an inch and a half, therefore, below the joint of the wrist. As the integuments in this situation are ample, and loosely attached, it is usually possible to retract them sufficiently, after the first incision, by the aid of light touches of the knife, without any regular dissection; when the wrist is reached, the part is held in a position midway between pronation and supination, and the 1 Archives Generales de MSdecine, Avril, 1842, pp. 413, 416. 2 TraitS de Cliirurgie d’Armee, p. 721.

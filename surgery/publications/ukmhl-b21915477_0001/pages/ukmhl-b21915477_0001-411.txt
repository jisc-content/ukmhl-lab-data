INTERROGATION OF THE INTERNAL ORGANS. 355 the course of the ureter, in renal colic; pain at the meatus after urination, and elongation of the prepuce, in vesical calculus; phimosis and its relation to urinary incontinence, convulsions, and eczema ; a diminished and twisted stream of water in stricture; urethral discharges and their connection with stricture; and frequent micturition as an indication of enlarged prostate and of cystitis, are all subjects which will demand investigation. The influence of sound kidneys on the success of operations is such that no prudent surgeon would willingly undertake an operation without previous examination of the urine, unless in cases where operative measures were un- avoidable. Examination of the urine should include an investigation of its quantity, specific gravity, color, reaction, and composition ; while the means for determining these points are measurement, the use of the manometer, ocular inspection, the employment of chemical reagents, and examination with the microscope. The principal substances to be sought for are albumen, blood, pus, muco-pus, sugar, urates, phosphates, and oxalates ; and the pres- ence or absence of each of these has an important bearing on both diagnosis and prognosis.

The field tourniquet (Fig. 106), numbers of which are sometimes distributed to troops in time of war, consists merely of a strap and buckle, with a pad to go over the artery; unless very firmly applied, it is apt to do harm rather than good by obstructing the venous, without controlling the arterial circulation, and is certainly inferior to the Morel tourniquet or Spanish windlass. Other instru- ments, which seem to me better adapted for the compression treatment of aneurism, or for temporary employment in cases of accidental hemorrhage, than for use in amputations, are the horse-shoe or Signoroni’s tourniquet (Fig. 107), &'key’s tourniquet (Fig. 108), Hoey’s clamp1 (Fig. 109), and Gross's arterial Fig. 108.

Under certain circumstances, however, as when it is desired to compress the abdominal aorta or common iliac artery preparatory to amputating at the hip-joint, the Petit’s tourniquet is inapplicable; and here the greatest benefit may be derived from the use of one of these other Fig. no. instruments. The compressor first employed in this operation by Prof. Joseph Pancoast, and since frequently used in this city (Philadelphia) for hip-joint amputations, was a large-sized Skey’s tourniquet, to which Prof. Pancoast added a second pad (Fig. Ill), so as to make very deep and firm pressure 1 This instrument is sometimes credited to Dupuytren.

563 CONDITIONS CALLING FOR AMPUTATION. part results simply from the intensity of the inflammatory process, as in the cases of frost-bite and burn, already referred to, no operation should be done while the mortification is still extending, but the surgeon should await nature’s indication that the limit of the destructive process has been reached, and may then amputate at any point above the line of separation which may he found convenient. There are, however, exceptions to this ordinarily well- founded rule. Thus in the purely local forms of gangrene which result from direct injury, as in severe cases of compound fracture in which for some reason primary amputation has not been practised, the limb should be re- moved as soon as the signs of mortification are unequivocally manifested; delay under these circumstances would commonly result in the patient’s death before time had been given for the formation of a line of separation. Again, in that frightful form of mortification which is variously known as the true “ traumatic or spreading gangrene,” “ bronzed erysipelas,” “ gangre- nous emphysema,” etc., the only hope, and that, it must be confessed, hut a slight one, consists in immediate amputation at a point sufficiently removed from the seat of disease to render unlikely a recurrence of gangrene in the stump; this was the form of gangrene which occurred in the case of fatal in- jury by a lion which I have already referred to; it is most common in con- nection with bad compound fractures and severe lacerated wounds, though it may follow comparatively slight injuries, and is particularly apt to occur in persons who are suffering from previously existing visceral disease, and espe- cially from organic affections of the kidney. There is another form of gangrene which may require immediate ampu- tation, and that is where death of a part results from an arterial lesion at a distant point, as where mortification of the foot depends upon a gunshot wound of the femoral artery. The gangrene in these cases first displays itself through a change in the coloration of the affected part, which is in the beginning pale and tallow-like, and afterwards mottled and streaked, while numbness is succeeded by complete insensibility. Guthrie’s advice as to the course to he pursued under such circumstances, appears to be judicious ; this is that while the gangrene remains limited to the toes or foot, the surgeon should delay, in hope that it will not extend further; but that as soon as the disease shows a tendency to spread above the ankle, amputation should be performed at that point at which experience has shown that the morbid pro- cess is likely to be arrested, that is, a short distance below the knee. If the upper extremity should he similarly affected, the point at, which the arm should he removed would be the shoulder-joint. Dry Gangrene, affecting the extremities of old persons, seldom admits of active treatment, the disease almost invariably recurring in the stump when an amputation is attempted. To avoid this risk, it has been recommended by James, of Exeter, and other surgeons, that, for gangrene affecting the toes, the operation should be done in the upper part of the thigh, where the tissues would presumably be more healthy than at a lower point; but it is obvious that the constitutional state of the patient, in most cases of senile gangrene, would render such a mode of treatment hazardous in the extreme. Greater success attends amputation for those forms of dry gangrene which are occasionally met with in young persons, as the result for instance of em- bolism ; but even in such cases, the surgeon should hesitate about interfering until the formation of a line of separation shows that nature is making an effort to throw off the portion of which the vitality has been lost. Amputa- tion may also be required in cases of Hospital Gangrene, or sloughing pha- gedsena, either after the morbid process has been arrested, on account of the great loss of substance, or even during its continuance, should profuse bleed- ing occur from the opening of a large artery. In the latter case, care should

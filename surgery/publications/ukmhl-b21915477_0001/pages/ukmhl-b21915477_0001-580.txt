MINOR SURGERY. 524 maintained during the period of actual cauterization. The main advantage of a galvano-cautery, is that the wire or other electrode can be accurately ad- Fig. 94.

The galvanic ecraseur of Middeldorpf consists of a coil of platinum wire which, by its attachments to a rod and a screw, can be shortened as it burns its way through the tissues around which it is placed. Before applying the coil around a diseased mass, as a cancerous nodule of the tongue, it is highly im- portant that the morbid structure should be isolated from the healthy tissues. This is best accomplished by long pins, ivory pegs, or curved needles in han- dles, passed through the healthy part in different directions. The coil is then placed around the part, behind the pins, and, as it burns its way through, the direction of the section will be determined by that of the pins. [Faure’s in- genious “secondary battery,” by which the galvanic current can be, as it were, stored away for future use, will probably add very much to the practical advantages of this mode of applying electricity.1] [* See British Medieal Journal, June 11, 1881, page 914.]

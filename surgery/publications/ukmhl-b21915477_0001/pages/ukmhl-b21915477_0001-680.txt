The late Mr. Callender, in 1864, presented to the Royal Medical and Chi- rurgical Society of London,1 statistics of 358 amputations performed during ten years at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. The deaths at different ages in 227 of these cases, are shown in the following Table:— Table showing effect of Age on Results of Amputation at St. Bartho- lomew’s Hospital. Cured. Died. Total.

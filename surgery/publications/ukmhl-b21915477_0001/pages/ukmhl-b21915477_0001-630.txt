An excellent instrument for this purpose is the “lion-jawed” forceps of Sir William Fergusson (Fig. 129). Another, still more powerful form of instrument, which bears the name of Farabeuf, is shown in Fig. 130. Fig. 130. Farabeufs forceps. Artery Forceps and Tenacula are employed to take up the cut arteries (and veins, too, if they bleed), preparatory to tying them. The best form of Fig. 131. Cross-spring forceps. forceps is that shown in Fig. 131, the blades crossing, and being kept shut by their own spring ; the blades themselves should be expanded a little way Fig. 132 above the points, so that when the ligature is applied it may readily slip down without including the ends of the instrument itself in the knot.

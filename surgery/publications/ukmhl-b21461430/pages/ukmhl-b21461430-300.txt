OX THE BATTLE OF THE YELLOW SEA. 232 struck the Saikyo-maiii, and a 21 cm. shell that hit the Chiyoda did not inflict any striking damages other than piercing the hull, on account of their not having exploded. Another remarkable example of this kind is seen in the case of a 15 cm. steel shell that fairly struck the Yoshino in the battle of Phung-do. After piercing through the deck-house on the upper deck, it fell into the engine-room and after rolling about for a while among the persons in the engine room, it came to rest Avithout exploding, inflicting no injury to any one. Again the fact that the number of the killed and wounded does not bear exact proportion with that of the explosions of shells received, is to be accounted for by the fact that damages so done greatly de|Dend on the place hit by shells. This will be learned from the two follow- ing tables.

KAKEE. 472 immediately for the expedition. As there was a comparatively poor supply of fresh food, the seamen ate too large a quantity of rice. Out of the twelve patients on the Takachiho, ten were stokers, whose hard work in the boiler room at a high temperature in a hot climate, caused them to drink water to excess, in consequence of which they disturbed their digestive organs. It was these circumstances that caused so many cases of the disease to occur on this ship. The three patients on the Matsushima suffered from a poor supply of fresh food ate, too large a quantity of rice and overworked themselves in the hot climate of Formosa. The two patients on the Omi-maru and the one on the Akitsushima did not eat too much rice but both suffered from a poor supply of fresh food and overwork in the hot climate of Formosa. The one patient on the Maya always disliked meat and was fond of liquors ; and, as the one patient on the Kaimon had a great liking for sweets he celebrated his return home by eating sweets to excess thus disturbing his digestive organs. The three patients on the Atago, and the one on the Katsuragi were obliged to take preserved food for a long time during the expedition ; so that they took a dislike to preserved meat and hard biscuits towards the end of the expedition. The one patient at the Base station was a. seaman on board the ship Chikugogawa-maru belonging to the station and took rice to excess. The two patients on the Akashi-maru, and the single cases on the Shinagawa-maru, Genzan-maru, Yedo-maru, and Genkai-maru with the two at Sasebo and one at K ure Barracks (the last three men were from the crews of transports -who came in after the occurrence of the disease) did not take regular food whilst on board the transports because these vessels were not war-ships and not under Navy regulations. The other case at the Kure Barracks was a second reserve man who had already suffered from the disease before the call.

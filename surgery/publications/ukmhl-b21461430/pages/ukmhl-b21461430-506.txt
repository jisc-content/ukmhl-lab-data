CHOLERA. 434 40,154 or 72.82 per cent, perished. This was the most serious epidemic of cholera we had for five years. One ship in which cholera broke out more or less as an epidemic was the Omimaru. While she was lying at anchor at Keelung, For- mosa, on July, 1895, two cases of pseudo-cholera appeared on board. The patients were immediately sent ashore and kept isolated, and the ship was subjected to strict disinfection; but in spite of all the efforts made to extinguish the disease, new cases continuously broke out, some of them resulting in death. So it was resolved that the ship should return home to Nagasaki and receive a wholesale disinfection. In this case the disease was perhaps introduced during her stay at Keelung, for at that harbour, she lay at anchor surrounded by trans- ports belonging to the army, in which many cases of cholera occurred from time to time. In the Kaimon 7 cases occurred. In the case of this ship, while it was at anchor at the Pescadores, great care was taken to prevent the entrance of the disease by shutting of all communication with the outside as far as possible, for the disease was prevalent among the soldiers and troops on land. However, as one of the principal duties of this ship was the survey of the adjacent seas, it was impos- sible entirely to stop communication with the land, and consequently she was also infected with repeated cases of the disease, though by dint of strict observance of disinfective measures, the officers and crew were able to keep themselves in health without seeing a great pre- valence of the epidemic. The Matsushima had 6 cases, each of which occurred separately after a long interval, and it was evident that each was affected at an infected harbour. Accordingly, perfect measures of disinfection being adopted each time a case broke out, the disease Avas kept in abeyance, and the health of the ship was not injured. There were 55 cases among those who were not of the proper force of the navy; 29

OS THE BATTLE OF THE YELLOW SEA. 239 ber of injuries, next the trunk and then the upper limbs, the head having the least number. Yet it is natural that the wider the area the higher the number of the shells received, and therefore in order to make a real comparison of the number of shells received, it is neces- sary that the area of the respective regions should be taken into account. The rate of the are;i of the respective regions apt to be struck by projectiles, according to Longmore, is 8.51 in the head (inclusive of the face and neck), 28.91 in the trunk, 21.14 in the upper limbs, 41.41 in the lower limbs. Comparing these with the number of shells received in each locahty, we find the head stands comparatively higher than the rest, next the upper limbs, then the trunk and lastly the lower limbs. This difference may be accounted for by the fact, that in land fights the head and upper limbs have to be exposed to the enemy, while the lower half of the body is often protected by some kind of shelter. But on board war-ships there being scarcely any such things as parapets, jungles (thickets) or ditches to cover the lower part of the body, it would naturally be expected that the region that has the widest area should receive the greatest number of projectiles. Yet the fact is to the contrary, as is shown in the table 7, A. If we arrange the numbers into four groups; that is, head, trunk, uppei- and lower limbs, the injuries of the head will show 35.68 per cent, of the trunk 22.61, of the upper limbs 19.10, and of the lower limbs 22.61 respectively. Here we see that the head though it has the smallest area, shows the highest number of injuries, not only comparatively but actually, while the lower limbs, most extensive in area have a compai-atively small number, so that the difference between them is more striking than it w^as even in the land fights. As regards the trunk and the upper limbs, the former somewhtit exceeds the latter in its actual number of injuries.

283 ABRASED M OTJNDS. that the WDudtn spjimer which is n }t so heavy is ai)t easily to deviate its course Avhen it hits an object ; and can give no further injury than the })resent kind, even if it strikes the tender skin at an angle of which other niis'siles as shell-fra^'meuts or ir<)n-pieces would have pro- duced wounds other tlian mere contusions. (4) Besides those mentioned abose, there were two cases in which it could not Ije ascertained whether the injury was caused bv a shell-fragment, iron-j)iece. or a wooden-splinter ; and three c:ises in which abrasion of the skin of tlie face was due to Ijlows of flvino" pieces of paint. Abrased wounds nund^ered 75 in ail ; and this seems to be rather rumier(5us compared with tlie number of contused wounds, considering that the glancing of missiles from surfaces almost ])arallel with their direction (which is the cause of the abrased wound) nuist be bv far less frequent than their impact against surf ices Iving at risfht angdes to them wliich is the cause of contused W(junds. lUit if the 8o cases which form the total of the injuries in question, and of o'utter wounds and wounds with loss of tissues occurring from iden- tical causes, be compared Avith the 413 cases, which f)rm the total of the various wounds produced by missiles striking the skin at a right or obtuse angle, the ratio will be seen to l)e no larger than 1 to 5, which can not be said to be disproportionate. ^Moreover, as not a few shell-fragments and iron-pieces take a slanting direction in com- ing down, it may reasonably be expected that they will in many cases merelv graze the skin. Again, in the time of battle, surgeons are often too busy fully to study the nature of each Avtnuid and abrased wounds mav be hastily classed amongst contusions, and vice-versa. The records are necessarily brief and discrimination is often very difficult.

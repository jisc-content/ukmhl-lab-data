THE NAVAL HOSPITAL OF THE SASEBO PORT ADMIRALTY. 536 they were respectively treated, and afterwards transferred to the Sasebo Naval Hospital by the transport Bankoku-niaru. The number of cases wounded in the battles and admitted to the Sasebo Naval Hospital was 145, and the number of other kinds of patients (the wounded by accidents not in combat, and those affected with diseases) admitted to the Hospital during the course of the war (July 1st, 1894, to December 31st, 1895) was 1,416. The ordinary staff of the Sasebo Naval Hospital consisted of five surgeons, one pharmaceutist, and 30 sick berth attendants and assist- ants, but to meet the emergencies of the war, the number of surgeons, sick berth attendants and employes etc., had been increased. Even so, however, just after the battle of the Yalu, every one attached to the hospital was exceedingly busy as more than 100 wounded were admitted to the Hospital at once and as there were many cases of injuries of the gravest kind, such as extensive burns, which required many hours in changing dressings. So they were compelled to in- crease the number of the temporary employes and to have them assist the sick berth attendants. At this time of need, great help was given by Madame Shibayama, wife of the Commander in Chief of the Sasebo Port Admiralty, and many other ladies, wives and daughters of naval officers, in preparing the bandages and caring for the patients. After that time, not a few of the ladies of the naval officers' families, as well as those of the towns and villages, applied for permission to nurse the patients in the Hospital, and the Red Cross Society of Japan notified that its nurses might be employed in the relief of the wound- ed. But by this time, the arrangements for the relief of the patients were already sufficient, so that there was no necessity to call for help from outside benefactors.

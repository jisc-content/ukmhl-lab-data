COXTUSED WOITXD. 299 Vcis'ifion of bl(3od between tlie bone and ihra mater in the neiglibour- liood of the fissure of Rolando caused the hemiplegia of the opposite side. Considered from the situation of the scalp wound, there is reason enough to account for the above statement. However, the tact that in the course of two months, the symptoms gradually abated and at length disappeared does not agree with the usual course of the hEemorrhage of the middle meningeal artery. Such haemorrhage is, as a rule, a serious case, in which symptoms of cerebral compression gradually arising, mostly results in death. At best, hemiplegia of the opposite side Avill persist. Therefore, if the case in question was due to the haemorrhage of the artery, we can only attribute it to a slight bleeding from a small brancli of the said blood vessel. However, as with the C'lse / of the contused wound caused by shell fragments, owino- to the de;ith of all the suro-eons on board, the clinical record of this case is imperfect, and it is not known whether there existed symptoms of concussion, compression, and spasm on the paralyzed side; so, these are the possible causes :—pressure by haemorrhage of the artery; contusion of the brain; injury of the cerebral substance by a piece of bone broken otf on the inner plate of the skull, or septic inflammation in the skull at the part struck, yet, judging from the symptoms and course as fir as were known, it is most likely that a depressed fracture or a septic infl;immation was not the cause. (4) Cases of contused Avounds, sustained by persons who hap- pened to be near where shells exploded in which the cause might be attributable to various kinds of fragments, that is, those of wooden and iron materials of the ship, as well as of shells, are as follows : — 1st example.—A mau actiug as carrier of tlie wounded had brought a patient to the surgery in the ward-room on the lower declc, when a 30.5 cm. shell exploded against the mizzen-mast in the room and killed the carrier by inflicting contused and

318 BLIND AND PENETRATING WOUNDS. clothes, this was undoubtedly the case even in the instances where no record is made of the presence of cloth. For in the treatments during battle or directly after, there are not a few instances in wdiich though a piece of cloth was taken out of wounds, yet no record of it was made. Also there may have been cases in which such pieces were taken out when the w^ounds were w^ashed afterwards, Avhich however was not recorded having escaped observation of the surgeons, and accordingly much to our regret, it is impossible to discuss this matter statistically. Instances in which shell-fragments stopped beneath the skin on the opposite side, were seen in jSTos. 12, 18, and 28. Of these, in No. 12, the shell-fragment was powerful enough to crush the femur, and in No. 18 it entered the side of the lumbar vertebrae breaking the ribs from the side of the chest, yet in neither case was there strength enough to |)ierce the skin from within. At first sight, such cases may appear to be exceptional, but the skin on the opposite side, having no support, can be stretched by pressure from within owing to its elasticity and a certain force is needed for piercing it through, and consequently, cases in Avliich shell-fragments stop beneath the skin oil the opposite side are not regarded as curious in military surgery. There was a case in Avhich several shell-fragments were found lodging in a single wound. This was seen by the blind wound of the right foot in example No. 20. It was not that three fragments of shell in the wound entered at one timeâ€”a sing-le frao^ment entered the wound and split into three on striking the bone. Such examples were found in other cases. A case in Avhich cause of death was probably due to haemorrhage was seen in example No. 9. This was indeed a serious Avound in the

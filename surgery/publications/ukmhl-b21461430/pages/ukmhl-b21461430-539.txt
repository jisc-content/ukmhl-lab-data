467 KAK'KE. were entirely free from the disease, while many of the sailors belong- ing to the ships were attacked by the disease. The companies then introduced changes of diet and all the sailors on board those ships were made to receive the same kind of rations as the seamen of the Navy. Again, in Brazil, beri-beri has existed from ancient times, but so sporadically that it attracted little attention ; during the last thirty or forty years, cases seem to have been increasing in frequency this is construed by many as showing its origin is attributable to the pro- pagation of the kak'ke virus owing to the developments of communi- cation ; and such persons conclude that it is an infectious disease. Having had no opportunities of investigating the disease in that country we are unable to offer any definite opinion ; but we think that we may reasonably seek a cause in the conditions which in our own country h;ive so abruptly increased tlie number of kak'ke cases during the last 20 or 30 years. As we have already stated, in former days kak'ke in our country was confined to such cities as Osaka and Tokyo, where people crowded in from other districts but imri passu with the increase of intercourse and commerce, the disease spread all over the land. Our explanation of this phenomenon is as follows: as means of communication increase, trade and intercourse become more frequent; schools and factories spring up here and there, attracting people to themselves ; and as a consequence the number of persons boarding in other houses greatly increases (the reader will remember that boarding houses never use barley and rice but rice only for their boarders). IJesides, with the development of C(3mmunication with foreign countries, the import of foreign rice (which is very inferior in quality) has given a plentiful supply to districts which hitherto were short of rice. And what is more, barley fields have lately been turned into mulberry plantations, owing to the development of sericulture. Hence the use of rice and especially inferior rice has greatly increased,

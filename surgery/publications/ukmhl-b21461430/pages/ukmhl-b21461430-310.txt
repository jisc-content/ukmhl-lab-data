This is because in naval battles, injuries are mostly caused by shells or their fragments, or large iron or wooden splinters, which Avould intlict cruel injuries by severing structures and organs, unlike bullet Avounds Avhich merely make small perforations for the passage of the bullets. The subsequent deaths that occurred during the course of treat- ment are 33, the percentage of Avhich according to the respective localities is as folloAvs : — Injuries of the Avhole body fi3.G4 Head injm-ies 9.09 Neck injuries 3.03 Chest injuries 3.03 Abdominal injuries 9.09 Injuries of the upper limbs 3.03 Injuries of the loAver limbs 9.09

THE BASE HOSPITAL AT PORT ARTHUK. 542 Base, and after inspecting the place he formed a plan for carrying out all sanitary measures and the design of the hospital now to be established. The other members arrived at the place of their appoint- ment, the earliest on the 31st of the same month and the latest on January 25th of the next year. A part of the public buildings belong- ing to the Chinese Navy was appropriated for the hospital, and wards for medical and surgical cases, isolation wards for infectious diseases, etc., provided, with other provisions required for admitting about fifty patients. It was opened on January 21st. In this hospital, special accommodations had been made for the wounded in battle, but from this time on there occurred no naval fight severe enough to pro- duce the wounded, except the bombardment of Wei-hai-wei. The wounded at the battle of Wei-hai-wei were directly conveyed to the Sasebo Naval Hospital by the hospital ship Kobe-maru, so the patients received in this hospital were cases suftering from diseases and injured by accidents with the Naval parties at Port Arthur and Talien- wan, and on the vessels of the Squadi-on. Of these the chronic cases* were sent to the Sasebo or Kure Naval Hospital by transports ; so the want of beds was never felt in this hospital. It was only during the prevalence of cholera that the members of the hospital were very busy as they had to work at measures of prevention and disinfection. The epidemic broke out at the middle of April, 1895, raged during the months of June and July, and, diminishing by the end of August, entirely disappeared at the end of September. The total number of the infected was 462, nearly all being officers, soldiers, and coolies be- longing to the Army; in the Navy only four pex'sons fell victims to it. Two surgeons were sent from this hospital as quarantine officers and they served in the business of inspection and disinfection along with the officers depatched from other quarters.

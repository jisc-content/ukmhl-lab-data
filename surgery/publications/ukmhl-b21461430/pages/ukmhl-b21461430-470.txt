398 SURGERY TX THE SHIP. killed all the surgeons and others who happened to he there, or at least inflicted serious wounds, and also destroyed nearly the whole of the surgical instruments &c. In the Matsushiniii, two surgeries were established, one on the upper deck of the fore part, and another on the Avaist of the lower deck, l^oth were destroyed by shells and the explosion of aninumition; and at this time the chief surgeon of the fleet was seriously injured, and some of the Ayounded persons ihen receiving treatment Avere killed; this caused also a great loss of surgical instruments &c. In the Yoshino, one of the surgeries AN'liich was phiced in the ward-room at the rear of the loAAcr deck, was twice struck by hostile shells, but luckily no one AA'as injured except a nurse Avho sustained a, slight Avound. We see therefore that any part that is aboA^e the water-line, is not free from the danger of being struck by shells and is of course unfitted for a surgery ; but in the absence of room below the line, there is no alternative but to be content with what is obtainable. In order therefore to facilitate the conveyance of the wounded, and avoid a Avholesale catastrophe like that experienced in the Hiyei, it is prudent to have tAvo surgeries, but this division has also its disadvantage for dividing the surgeons, nurses, and surgical implements that are anyhoAV limited in number and quantity in every ship, affords much inconvenience in treating many wounded men at the same time. In naval battles, sometimes fifty or sixty are Avounded at a time and in one place.

At the same time, the medical attendants in the other surgery may have nothing to do, and yet they are not able to help each other which

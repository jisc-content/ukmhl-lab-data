319 BLIND AND PENETRATINa WOUNDS. neck; the trachea, oesophagas and carotid artery were rent open, but no lesion was found in the cervical vertebrEe, so instant death should not have occurred unless the right common carotid artery had been injured. This case will be further discussed later on. Example No. 21 was a case of a penetrating wound in the nasal bridge. The wound communicated with the maxillary sinus, and destroyed the inner wall of the right orbit causing a contusion <>f the eye-ball and detachment of the retinn, complicated with small blind wtrands, one below the lower margin of the right orbit, and one on the right cheek. tSubse(pient (occurrence of obstinates anaesthesia in the right cheek and temple, was due to the injury of the cutaneous branches of the third division of the trifacial nerve, accompanied the reflex paralysis of the auriculo-temporal branches. Such paralysis is not of rare occurrence in gunshot wounds. Penetrating wounds of the abdomen were shown in Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5. The patients all died except one. The size of the wound was not rt^corded in one case, but it destroyed the anterior superior spine of the right ilium ; another case had a round aperture 3 c. m. in diameter near the umbilicus ; and the third had also a round orifice the size of a 2 sen copper below the umbilicus. As the abdominal walls yield to a great extent by pressure it is frequently observed that a fragment larger than the wound orifice has entered into the cavity. The two instances above mentioned in which the sizes of the wound orifi- ces are recorded, were similar round holes some 3 c. m. in diameter, and we may infer that in bt^th cases the shell fragments w^ere not small. Moreover, they must have injured the abdominal organs, as they certainly had irregular angular shapes ; and it is obvious that all cases were serious. The instant death, however, in these cases should not be attributed only to injuries of the abdominal organs,

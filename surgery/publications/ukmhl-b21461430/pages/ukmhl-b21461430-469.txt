CHPTER VI. MANAGEMENT OF THE WOUNDED. l.-SURGERY IN THE SHIP. The surgei'y of :i, ship ong-lit to l^e conveniently placed for collect- ing the wounded IVoin the various parts of the sliip, find also in places least liidile to he disturhed by hi^stile shells. In the men-of-war of fornier days as in the time of Nelson, there was a wide hatch extending vertically from the upper deck to tlie l)ottom, and below the water line which was admirably adapted, l)eing in the centre of the ship, for spa- cious surgeryâ€”Nowadays this ])art is occupied l)y the engine room, coal bunks etc., leaving no room foi- the wounded. Idiis difficulty is experienced noAv in every ship, the surgery must be placed at the fore and aft of the ship and consequently two are necessary, for it would be inconvenient to convey the wounded from one end of the ship to the other, especially so wiien the water-tight (h^ors Avere closed, neces- sitating a very roundabcjut communication between the fore and aft of the ship. ]jut, as in almost all ships, thei"e was no room for a sur- gery at the fore or aft below the water-line, therefore places like the lower deck were chosen which is above the water-line, and not quite free from the intrusion of hostile shells, so it was the general scheme that t?v^o surgeries one at each end should be established. But some ships lacking room, had to be content with ordy one surgery. The Hiyei is an instance of this kind, and in the ship as already stated, the surgery which was established in the wardroom at the rear of the lower deck, was hit by an enormous shell which

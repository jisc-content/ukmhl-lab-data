LACEE,A.'rid;D AND MUTILATED WOUXDS. 364 Burns on the head, neck, chest, and upper and lower extremities at- tended with the rupture of both membrana tympani. The burns AYere healed and the hearing on both sides was gradually restored, but the person was dismissed as he became idiotic. The above mentioned 4 cases were the only ones in the room at the time of the explosion, avIio escaped instant denth ; and of these, two died later from traumatic de- lirium, 1 person became idiotic, and was dismissed from tlie service, and the last was the only one who was completely cured. Thus, of 13 persons who were at the time in the room where the explosion oc- curred, 9 were killed on the spot, 2 died afterwards from their wounds, 1 recovered but was discharged, and 1 only was able to resume service. No decided opinion can be given about the killed, their chief wounds only being recorded, but the 4 persons not killed on the spot all sus- tained burns, and three of them furthei- sustaitjed rupture of the membrana tympani. Thus it can easily be seen that in cases of wounds inflicted in the very neighborhood of a shell-explosion, there will occur, besides wounds given by the blow of powerful shell fragments, iron or wooden pieces, those injuries Avhich are liable to be caused by explo- sion-gas and flames. Traumatic delirium ensued in 2 out of the 4, showing a violent shock to the nervous system. This is agreeable to all experience elsewhere. In the -fth quarter of the lower deckâ€”that is, fore-part of the wardroom where the explosion occurred, there were 8 persons killed or wounded, of Avhom (18) had both thighs mutilated and died on the spot ; (19) met the same fate from the compound fractures of the face, the base of cranium and the upper and loAver limbs; (20) sustaining compound fracture of the right thigh and heavy contused wounds of the right arm and chest Avhich killed him instantly ; (21) got a blind Avound in the left thigh, lacerated Avound of the right middle finger,

ABRASED WOUNDS 282 parallel with the Surface struck, so that only the epidermis or a piece of the skin is stripped off. Those wounds which expose the subcutaneous or muscular tissues, yet do not resemble the gutter wound, are also enumerated in this category. " Gutter wound " is the appellation for those wounds produced by the same cause as above, in which the tissues were lost in a long, narrow shape forming a groove. Wound with loss of soft tissues " is the general name for wounds in which both the skin and other soft tissues have been extensively lost from the same causes. (1) The abrased wounds due to the fragments of shells num- bered 47 in all, occurring in 30 persons. None of them presented interesting phases w^orthy of special record, as they were all healed in a few days ; and with those wounds Avhich were rather deep there were none with a surface clean cut as by a sharp 1)lade, but, mostly, the tissues of the surface were irregularly contused with n)ore or less extravasation of blood around them. Of the 289 ciises of all kinds of wounds caused in this way, this class shows a ratio of 16.26 per cent. (2) Abrased wounds produced by iron-fragments were 10 for 9 persons, all of Avhich were a liglit nature and need no special record ; the ratio is 16.67 per cent of 60 wounds produced in this way. This is almost the same as the ratio of the AN'ounds occasioned by shell-fragments. (3) Abrased wounds inflicted by w^ooden splinters numbered 13 occurring in 8 persons and were all light. They bear a ratio of 22.41 per cent out of 58 wounds, the total produced by the same cause, and the ratio is comparatively a little larger than those of shell- fragments and iron-pieces. This is probably attributable to the fact

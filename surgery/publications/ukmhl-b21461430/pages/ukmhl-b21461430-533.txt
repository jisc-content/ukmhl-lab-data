KAK'KE. 461 provide themselves with ample store of food, and they also took much care that indoor exercises should not be nef^lected. Not a sino'le case of kak'ke occurred this time, and the island is now receiving fresh immigrants every year. To mention another example; in the year 189.5, a man and his wife attempted to mnke meteorological obser- vations on the summit of the famous Mt. Fuji, which has a lieight of 3,800 meters above the sea-level. They commenced their stay on the peak in September of that year. About Novomber both of them were affected with kak'ke which gradually became so serious that at last they were obliged to come down at the end of December. Fuji is a peak of almost everlasting snow which covers it all the year, except for a few days during the hottest time of summer, and of course the cold in winter is extreme. No explanation of this case of kak'ke can be given except that the conditions were generally the same as on Shimushu island. In both cases it is urged by some, the parties concerned were compelled during winter to confine themselves to a room or rooms with all windows and doors shut and a stove constantly burning within ; and this made the air so foul as to cause kak'ke virus to develop. This argument seems to have some semblance of truth, but we think it is wrong. Shimushu island had for years been inhabited by the aborigines whose habitations were all in caves damp and dark; and therefore the quality of air was not to by compared with that of the huts our emigrants lived in. Yet as far as we have been able to learn of the oriofinal inhabitants of Shimushu now living in Shikotan, they were never affected with the disease in their former home. We believe therefore that all the influence that foul air can have on kak'ke is indirect and nothing more; impairing the general health and diges- tive functions. At Seoul, Fusan, Chemulpo, and other places in Korea, numerous Japanese live side by side with the natives, yet every year

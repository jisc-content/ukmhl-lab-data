497 WOUNDS. the men kept their bodies unclean, owing to the insufficient supply of fresh water, which prevented them from bathing as usual. Sea-water baths were indeed often ordered, but the men hated the disagreeable sensation felt after such baths if not cleaned afterwards with fresh water and most of them refused to take such baths. Also, the frugal use of fresh water did not allow the needful washing of their clothing, and consequently they were often obliged to keep on garments soiled with the sweat of many weeks. This partially accounts for the pre- valence of the diseases under consideration. 9.-W0UNDS. Wounds incurred outside of action w^ere 838, of which 15 result- ed in death; the ratio of the wounds per 1,000 force being 58.76. The injuries that occurred in largest numbers were contused wounds (402), contusions (162), burns and scalds (80), incised wounds (-13), frost- bites (34). Contused wounds, contusions, and incised wounds occur- red in the laro-est number durinsr the five months from August to December, 1894, and burns and scalds also were produced in compara- tively large numbers during the same period. As for the places of occurrence, most of them took place on board the ships abroad. Most of the frost-bites were produced between Xovember of the same year, and the February following. Abroad, the Hiyei, and at home, the Sasebo Barracks had the largest number of frost-bites. With the ex- ception of frost-bites, all the wounds above mentioned must be regard- ed as results of over-work. For, even after the victory of the Yellow Sea, our fleet mounted guard over the seas, without being oif duty a day, and this must have been a cause why so many wounds were produced. The cases of frost-bites in the fleet abroad were twice as numerous as those at home. This was because the cold on the seas

431 CHOLERA. February 5tli from home many patients appeared suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. This ship was originally a foreign trade-ship which was purchased by a Japanese merchant during November of the preceding year, and after undergoing more or less repairs, was chartered as a transport in the service of the Army, the present voyage to Port Arthur being her first trial in her new service. She had on board soldiers and coolies numbering 150, and horses to the same number. It was on February 2nd, during her voyage to the said port that a patient was attacked with vomiting and diarrhoea, followed successively by new patients to the number of 11, before she had reached her destination on the 5th; and the cases had increased to 35 by the 8th following. Of these 35, two died before entering the hospital, and three after admission ; the persons affected were not limited to a certain class, but troops, coolies, and ship's crew were alike sufferers from the disease. It was all but certain that the cause of this outbreak was to be fouiid in the ship itself. For, other persons beloriging to the same companies and placed on three other ships were entirely free from any affection liaving symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea. It naturally follows that the cause was in the ship, and did not exist before the passengers went aboard. However, fortunately by means of strict measures of disinfection, the disease was confined to the ship and did not spread. (D) Among the soldiers and coolies of the Army that were removed from Wei-hai-wei to Port Arthur from the end of February to the beginning of March, there were many cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. This however, happily ceased by March 20th, without spreading at all. (E) On March 19th, at Moji, Japan, a case of cholera was report- ed, and another at Ujina on the 28tli following. These two places had each a Commissariat Department, and were centres of transportation.

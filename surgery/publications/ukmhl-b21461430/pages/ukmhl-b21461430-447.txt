CHAPTER V. COMPLICATIOXS OF WOUNDS. l.-HyEMORRHAGE. Witli tlie exception of contusion, we suppose that all Avounds alike are attended at first with more or less haemorrhage. It is true that the hemorrhage and pain in tlie first stage are n(jthing more than the inevitable symptc^ms of Avounds, hut for the sake of convenience, we Avill give tliem special headings. (1) Primary haemorrhage. In naval Avarfare, liaemorrage is com- paratively slight Avith every class and descriptiori of Avounds. Every shell Avound destroys tissues, and bruises more or less extensively the tissues of the surrounding parts; so Avhenever an injury is inflicted the vascular tissues sustain more or less contusion aboA^'e and beloAA\ When the vessels are rent, their middle and inner coats are first torn, and curled inAvards ; then the outer coat liarjgs loosely doAvn, so that the coagulation of blood in tlie vessels is greatly facilitated. More- over, Avith a. mutilated or seriously lacerated Avound, a severe shock Avill often occur which retards the function of the heart and still more fixcilitates coagulation. This is tlie reason Avliy tlie hemorrhage is so small with shell-Avouinls. After the conclusion f)f tlic war, one hundred ([uestions Avere draAvn up relative to Avounds and various sanitary matters, and an- sAvers Avere collected from surgeons. The folloAving are the replies as far as they relate to the (juesti(^,n of lia?iiiorrliage in shell-Avounds : â€”

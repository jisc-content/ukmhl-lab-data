VACCINATION. 447 disappeared without making any further infection. This was probably because most of the ship's crew had already been affected with the disease. (7) VACCINATION. In China and Korea, owing to the backward state of their sanitation, no year passes without seeing more or less a prevalence of small-pox.

The tot;d number of cases of varioloid and variola that occurred in the Navy during five years 1S91 â€”1895, was no more than nine.

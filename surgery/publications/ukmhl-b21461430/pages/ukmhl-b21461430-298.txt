ox THE BATTLE OF THE YELLOW SEA. 230 gaged below the water line were the least injured. It is true that six of the magazine men in the Hiyei and "five of the stokers in the Itsukushima, who all were working below the Avater line were at once killed or wounded : the former because the fragments of a shell that had exploded on a loAver deck, fell in the cock-pit at the entrance of the magazine, and the latter because a shell which had pierced through the middle part of the starboard side, and come through the coal- bunker, hit the ladder set against the middle steps of the engine room and there exploded. No injury, hoM'ever, to life was sustained from any shell that knocked directly through the ships below the Avater line. TABLE NO.

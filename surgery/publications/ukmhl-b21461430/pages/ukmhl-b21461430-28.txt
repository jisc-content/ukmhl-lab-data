4 THE BATTLE OF YALU. In this battle our warships received more than one hundred shells in various parts, and two hundred and ninety eight persons were either killed or injured. A naval battle is a very formidable thino", much more so than a land fiocht : for it consists of either firinir big guns, ramming, or the discharge of fish-torpedoes, by which a whole ship may suddenly be destroyed or sunk, even when it is simply hit by shells without exploding. Ships' planks, furniture &c., are destroyed, and many lives are lost, or injuries sustained from the flying splinters. When the shells explode, fearful damage results. Occasionally ships hit by shells escape without injury to life, but this depends upon the part of the ships hit. In this battle our ships fortunately escaped total destruction though the damage done to each ship was severe, especially on the Matsushima where the bursting of a shell caused the explosion of the ammnnition. The following table shows the number of shells which hit our ships and the number of killed and woimded. Ships. Shells HIT. Killed. In.jured. Total of killed and IN-JUBED.

No matter how cold the tem- perature may be, severe kak'ke will constantly make its appearance, whenever a large quantity of rice is taken in the absence of other diet rich in nitrogenous and fatty ingredients. The aforementioned pre- valence of kak'ke in Niigata prison is an example of this. Niigata being situated in the north of our country is a very cold region, the epidemic broke out in the month of January, when the temperature is at its lowest and just at that time the ground was covered with snow several feet deep. The island of Shimushu at the northern ex- tremity of the Kuriles foces Kamtchatka and washed as it is by the cold cvu'rent of the ]>ehring Strait, is the coldest region in our Empire.

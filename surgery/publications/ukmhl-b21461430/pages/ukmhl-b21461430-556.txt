DISEASES OF THE RESPIEATORY SYSTEM. 484 inoculating its virus on animals, and there have been many cases to prove that infection also takes place with the human body. Phthisis being a chronic infectious disease, its virulent power will only be effective on those who expose themselves often to the virus, or to those who have a constitution susceptible to it. It must not therefore be regarded with the same fear that we have for acute infectious diseases as small-pox and cholera. Nevertheless, as a result of its being universally recognized as infectious, people are apt to look upon it with extreme dread, so much so that they often lose their presence of mind when they come in contact with a patient. We cannot approve of this fear ; never the less, it is important that we should take proper measures for the prevention of the disease. For this reason, we here give, for the consideration of those concerned, a statement of the conditions favoring the infection of the disease, and of the general measures for its prevention. The Infection of Phthisis :â€”The infectious virus of a phthisical patient is usually to be Ibund in his spittle, not in his breath nor in the emanation from his skin. It must be remembered that the infection of the disease is chiefly through the spittle of the patient. The virus of phthisis enters the body either through the respiratory system, or through the alimentary canal. It enters through the respiratory system when the spittle of the patient is dried up, broken into particles, and flies about in the air in the form of dust. It enters the body through the alimentary canal, when the virus is swallowed in a mass with food (especially with raw milk). There have indeed been cases in which the virus has been absorbed through a wound in the skin, but these cases are exceptional. The virus of phthisis does not directly lose its power or life, even when it has been discilarged out of the body, and this is particularly the

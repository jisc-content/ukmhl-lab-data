This falls far short of the minimum quantity of nutritious ingredients—that is, 500 grammes of carbo-hydrates 50 grammes of fat, and 118 grammes of albuminous substance, which according to the estimation of Dr. Voit is indispensable to a man of ordinary health and middle age, who takes adequate daily exercise. And if compared with the minimum quantity of nutritious ingredients of the food needed by a man who takes itctive exercise,—that is, 500 grammes of carbo-hydrates, 100 grammes of fat, and 145 grammes of albuminous substance, it shows a still greater deficit. Indeed, carbo- hydrates surpasses the quantity guaranteed by this physiological investigation, but fat and albumen are seen to be remarkably deficient. On the contrary, not a navy in the world has a diet of which nutritive value falls below the physiological standard. The diet of om' Navy compared badly with that of European countries, but the sanitary conditions of our ships were not inferior to European, for most of them had been constructed in England, America, or other European countries, and were equally well equipped. The daily exercise and work of our seameri being organised after the pattern of the English Navy are identical. Our seamen are also provided with clothing and beds similar to those of the West.

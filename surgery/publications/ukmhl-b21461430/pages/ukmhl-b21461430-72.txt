48 THE ATTACK ON WEI-HAT-WET. the Chinese fleet in the port made a desperate but fruitless defence. On February 12th the enemy surrendered to our fleets. In this service our vessels were not all equally engaged : some served only a day, while others were engaged for several days in successive engagements. Consequently the damages sustained varied with each vessel. We subjoin lists of the numbers and ranks of the officers and men on board each vessel : of the dates when they were engaged in the fighting, and of the amount of damage sustained on each occasion.

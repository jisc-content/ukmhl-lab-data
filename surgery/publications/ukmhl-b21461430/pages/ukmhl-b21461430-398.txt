BLIXD AND PEXETEATING WOUNDP. 330 3i-cl example :â€”This is the case of the blintl wonud of the left -leg meutioiiecl in the 18th example of blind wouncls caused by shell fragments; it could not be ascert- ained whether the foreign bod}' extracted from the wound was a shell-fragment or an iron-piece. The blind wounds of uncertain cause whether by shell-fragments or iron-pieces are the three above mentioned. As regards the 1st example, the wounds in the calf of the left leg, and on the outer- side of the left ankle joint it is sure, Avere caused by iron-pieces, but the cause of that on the left side of the chest was not certain. In the latter wound, the 5th and 6th ribs beiiiO' broken hiemorrhao-e was profuse, but inferring from the fact that there were no signs of lung-injury, or of the entrance of a foreign body into the thoracic cavity, and that two ribs were broken indicating the causative object not to have been small, we should think that in the present wound, as in the 11th example of the blind wounds caused by shell frag- ments, the causative missile did not penetrate entirely, but in part, that it broke the ribs, and fell off of its own accord. Though in the clinical history of this case the size of the wound orifice was not stated, we are told that it Avas a Avide lacerated one, Avhich fact evinces that the wound Avas not inflicted by a small fragment falling doAvn in a slanting direction. The death on the following day seems to have been occasioned by internal ha3morrliage, Avhich Ave shall further discuss in the next chapter. As for the 2nd example, the mutilated Avound of the upper part of the right thigh Avas certainly produced by a shell-fragment, but Avith the injury in the forehead it is not known, Avhich of these tAvo objects, a fragment of shell or iron metal, Avas the cause. If the object be ascertained to have entered the skull, Ave should say judging from its force, that it Avas a shell-frag- ment, but whether it did actually penetrate or not is likeA\'i,-<e doubt-

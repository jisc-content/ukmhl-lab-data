PERFOEATED WOUXbS. 349 and naturally all kinds of wounds are caused more frequently by shell- fragments, especially this difterence is markedly great in the case of perforating wounds ; for of all the wounds caused by shell-fragments, the perforating wounds have 11.45 per cent, while of all the wounds by iron-pieces the perforating wounds only cover 5.00 per cent, Avhich is not half so great as the former. Now, if we compare the causes of perforating wounds at large, those caused by shell-fragments rover 86. 84 per cent, and those produced by iron-pieces only 7.89 per cent, showino: a sfreat dilference. The character of the perforating wound by an iron-piece was almost the same Avith that caused by a shell-fragment. The fact that the entrance hole is larger than the exit Avas seen in the 3rd instance. We can not assert anything positively of the first instance, for the size of neither hole Avas recorded, but there Avas perhaps the same ditference w^ith the ord instance, as both Avere perforating Avounds of the soft parts. The 2nd instance was a very curious case as a perforating Avound caused by an iron-piece. Inferred from the recorded character of the entrance orifice, it seems that tlie iron-piece AA^ns a large rough fragment Avhich first broke the skin Avitli its curved fiat surface ; and not Avith the pointed part Avhich might have rent the skin Avith its sharp end. HoAvever, this piece smashel the scapula from the back, then entering the arm again broke the humerus, leaving a crater-like exit. The piece must have been an exceedingly forcible one, to do so much damage but it is doubtful hoAv a scattered iron- piece could h;ive been imparted Avith so great a force. Indeed, among various Avounds inflicted by iron-pieces, there are such serious kinds as mutilated Avounds, but this is attributable to the ponderous size and weight of the pieces. HoAvever an iron-piece Avhich may pro- duce a perforating AA'ound must naturally be limited in size and

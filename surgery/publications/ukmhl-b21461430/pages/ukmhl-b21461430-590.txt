DRINKING WATER. 518 not tuke the trouble to completely cleanse it before loading fresh water again. Afterwards strict care was taken to prevent a repetition of this. Again some water-boats leaked : the water taken into them from a transport became mingled with sea-water if they were long on the sea before transferring their water to a battle ship, and thus the water became unfit to drink. As stated above, drinking water was first examined when it was taken on board a transport, and again before transferring the water to a battleship ; thus every precaution was taken against using bad water. The only exceptional case was in the Akitsushima, which suft'ered greatly from want of drinking water, and was some- times compelled to take in water containing so much salt as to make it unfit for drink. For this reason, in that ship the greatest care was taken, and it was invariably boiled, nevei'theless, the water that was once supplied by a transport happening to contain an ex- cess of salt, proved we hear, to be the cause of a temporary prevalence of diarrhoea on board the ship. Save this, there was no ship in which drinking water proved injurious to health. Drinks for the Stokers:—During the watch, especially in summer, the stokers consumed a large quantity of water, the amount for each varying, during the 4 hours' watch, from 60 ounces to 180 ounces. The report from the surgeon on the Fuso says : During the voyage, in the months of August and September 1894, 12 stokers on watch for 4 hours in the boiler -rooms, where the temperature was from 108° to 134° F. drank 840 ounces, and 8 persons on watch for the same time in the engine-rooms drank 300 ounces, and dur- ing the battle of the Yellow Sea double the quantity was taken in the boiler-room, and one and a half of the said amount in the engine-room. Excessive use of water like this disturbs the stomach, and it is said that stokers have therefore been more frequent sufferers from

438 DYSEXTEEY. the water was conducted to wooden tanks each ten tons in capacity by means of buried pipes, and from the tanks water was drawn up with pumps. Moreover, as the water was very excellent in quality, it could not be regarded as affording any cause for dysentery. In time of war, naturally temporary dwellings could not be regarded as perfect, for the floors were made of straw mats laid on the ground, with canvas roofs under which the occupants sat and slept. l^ut the utmost care possible in war time was taken with a view to their health. The provisions consisted of biscuits, rice, tinned meats, and nothing else, so that we could not consider their food as having in any way contributed to the production of dysentery. However, as it was the beginning of cool autumn, the bedding of the coolies was too poor to keep them warm enough, and they were thus exposed to chills. This may have been the predisposing cause of the disease. There existed a few cases of intermittent fever among the coolies, but there was no reason to consider the place as a malarial district. As has been stated, the naval station under consideration was situated in the fields distant from the dwellings of the native inhabitants among whom also there existed no case of dysentery, so the disease that prevailed among our men could not have been introduced from the natives. The only probable cause was found in the following' fact. The coolies that assembled at the said station— over 600 in number—chiefly came from Saga, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Fukuoka, where dysentery prevails more or less every year. Among them, there seem to have been some who had been latently affected with the disease which appeared after their arrival at the station. Hence the propagation. Comparatively the largest number of patients were found among the last batch of coolies—100 in number—sent by Ichimura & Co., that arrived on September 1st from home.

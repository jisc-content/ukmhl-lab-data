HEMORRHAGE. 380 case hajiiiorrliage Avas copious in each wound, the face turning pale, pulse thready and intermittent, and the patient almost instantly fM- ing into unconsciousness. This is quite natural, hecause the tissues having been roughly destroyed by a weighty iron-fragment a severe shock took place ; hasmorrage ought to have been very slight, and it seems rather strange that the contrary is recorded. 15ut iron-pieces and shell-fragments do not always have the same effects, some of them having keen edges may happen to sever or half sever a blood vessel, in Avhich case heavy haemorrhage may occur from such a Avound. Ikit this reason can not be put forward in this case and if it is true as recorded, that hasmoi'rhage was heavy from each wound, then it must be put down to the peculiar constitutiorj of the injured person, and the unconsciousness accordingly attributed to the heavy haemorrhage. As regards shell wounds, it is very rare that the injury of a blood vessel is the sole cause of death, for instance, according to the clinical history, No. 154 received a deep contused wound on the inner side of the loAver third of the right thigh, by whicli the femoral artery having been injured, htemorrhage took place, the bleeding hoAA'Cver being at once staunched by the application of a compress by a carrier, the patient Avas brought to the surgery and receiving treatment, Avhen the explosion of a shell, mutilated his chest and abdomen and caused instant death. This is an instance of an injured artery Avhere hiemorrhage does not seem to have been heavy, he might have recover- ed if he had not been subsequently struck Avith the explosion of the shell. Among the killed by the penetrating Avounds of the abdomen, there are one or tAvo cases in Avhich the cause of death appears to have been hajmorrhage owing to the injury of large blood vessels in the abdomen. ]]ut this is merely supposition, and not proved by autopsy, for such a severe Avound of the abdomen may ])roduce death independ-

There Avere two cases: one was No. 9 example of contused wound by shell-fragment, and the other Xo. 1 example of contused wound by a wooden splinter. In each case, as we have already considered, the compression of the sensory and motor centres near the fissure of Rolando seemed to be the cau-ie. The precise character of the lesion could not, however, be ascertained, for ijot only coidd no injury be recognised on the skull, but the patient afterwards completely recover- ed. (See examples of the wounds in the preceding chapter.) (4) Injury of nerves. With shell-wounds, a nerve may sustain contusion, or may be partly or entirely severed; but it also frequently happens that a large brancli will escape injury on account of a favour- ed position or stout sheath. This is especially the case when the man is hit by an obtuse headed missile like a ballet. In this war, there were only 2 cases in which rather a large ner\'e was plainly injured by a shell-fragment or piece of iron or wood. One is Ko. 7 instance of contused wound by an iron piece in the last chapter, in which a contused wound sustained just above the internal condyloid eminence of the right humerus. At first, there seemed to be no lesion in the ulnar nerve, but paralysis accruing in the di:stributing region, the nerve must have suffered a contused wound by being compressed between the iron-piece and tlie bone. The paralysis lingered on after the wound had healed, but disappeared ultimately. The other case is Xo. 10 instance of a perforating wound by shell-fragment in which the middle of the humerus was perforated from back to front. While the splint was being applied, no paralysis was recognised in the limb, but when afterwards the splint Avas removed, paralysis Avas found in the region supplied by the musculo-spiral nerA^e, and tliis Avas never completely cured. We could not ascertain the character of the Avound,

436 DYSENTERY. could never be said to be a prevalence of tbe sickness. The only place that showed any state of prevalence was the naval station of Longreach in Korea. The following is the abstract of a report by the Chief Surgeon of the station. The Longreach station was one temporarily set up at the north-western end of the Shinchi island in the south of Korea. On August 20th, 1894, the officei's, men and coolies attached all landed at that place, erected tents, and then were engaged in planning schemes of defence. On August 31st, a coolie named Suyekichi Otsubo applied for medical relief saying he was suffering from diarrhoea.

Here- upon, he was placed in an isolated room, the water closet visited by the patient was thoroughly disinfected, all his evacuations burnt and perfect measures of prevention adopted. The patient was sent home on September 4th to Sasebo on board a transport. Again on Sep- tember 8th, two seamen and one coolie were affected with the disease, followed by one more coolie on the 9th. These four men applied for medical help for the first time on the night of the 10th following. They were diagnosed as suffering from dysentery, so they were also isolated. A suitable spot was now selected, and an infectious ward commenced on the morning of the 11th, being completed on the following day. 11 cases of dysentery were at once removed to the ward, for sufferers had increased to that number, as the 11th produced 2 more patients among the seamen, and 5 among the coolies. Water-closets numbering 19 in all were each well disinfected, and the bowel evacuations in them taken to a distant place and buried. At the same time it was resolved that disinfectants should be liberally sprinkled over the closets every day. On the 13th following, 2 coolies fell sick, and on the 14th 1 seaman and 3 coolies..

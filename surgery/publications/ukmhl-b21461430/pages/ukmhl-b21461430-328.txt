OF ATTACK OX WKI-HAI WEI. 260 In this action, the region with the largest number of casualties was the lower limbs, next the head, and last the upper limbs. If the injuries be allotted to four locaUties ; tlie injuries to the whole bod\-, being excepted,â€”viz : the head, the trunk, the npper and lower limbs, we shall see that the head occupies ol.25 ])er cent, the trunk 18.75, the upper limbs 16.67, the lower limbs o3.oo. If the area of these localities be considered the head and face occupies 8.51 per cent, the trunk 28.91, the upper Hnibs 21.14, the lower limbs 41.41, so that the number of injuries is greatest in the iiead, those in the other parts being nearly in proportion to their respective ai-ea. Again, if the above figures be added to those of the killed and wounded in the battle of the Yellow sea, the head claims 86 persons, i.e., 34.82 per cent, the trunk 54, i.e., 21.86, the upper limbs 46, i.e., 18.62, the lower limbs 61, i.e., 24.70, from which Ave see that the figures for the head stand high. Further adding to these the number of the killed and wounded from the shock of the explosion of shell or of firings, we get 95 persons, i.e., 34.80 in the head, 58 persons, i.e., 21.25 in the trunk, 53 per- sons, i.e., 19.41 in the upper limbs, 67 persons, i.e., 24.54 in the lower limbs. Once more by adding to these 5 cases of burns and scalds according to locality, we get 95 persons, i.e., 34.17 in the head, 58 persons, i.e., 20.86 in the trunk, 55 persons, i.e.. 19.78 in the upper limbs, 70 persons, i.e., 25.18 in the lower limbs. Ikit the stat- istical nimiber of the killed and wounded in the battle of the Yellow sea as stated in table No. 7 A.., and of those at Wei-hai-wei in the above table, composes only one principal injury sustained by an indi- vidual in exclusion of all the other minor wounds. For instance, cases in whicli a more serious wound on the head were classified as such, to the exclusion of many less severe ones on the lower limbs, it is not clearly shown which locality really sustained the largest

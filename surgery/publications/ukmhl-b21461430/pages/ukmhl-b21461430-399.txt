The ord example has been already dis- cussed among" the Avounds by shell-frao'ments. (5) There is one case of blind wound pr(xluced by buck-wheat husks:â€” An eiiorraons shell bui'st on the lower deck and the explosion gas, sheli-frnginents and other kinds of broken pieces welled up out of the sky-light, when an irregular round blind wound 3 cm. in diameter was inflicted on the back of the n:iddle of the right forearm. The wound was 3 cm. deep retaining f.n-eign bodies at the bottom, which, being taken out proved to be 6 or 7 buck-wheat husks. The wound was heal- ed in 7 weeks. (No. 221.) From the existence of buck- Avheat husks in tlie Avound, they Avere regarded as the cause of the injury, Imt the A\'Ound aperture Avhich was an irregular round one o cm. both in diameter and depth could not have been produced merely by buck-Avheat husks. The husks Avhicb had been used as the stuffing of a pilloAV can not be regarded as having produced a single hole of such a size, even had they been driven in a large mass. Therefore, Ave should say that the husks entered the tissues sticking to a shell-fragment, or an iron-piece and were left behind, while the main object came off owing to its partial penetration into the tissues. (6) There Avas one case prc^duced by a bullet, but Avhether it was from a musket or Gatlins: ffun Avas not known. The Avound Avas a small blind Avound merely piercing the skin. The blind and penetrating Avounds numbered 79 in all as stated before, of which 57 Avere caused by shell-fragments, 12 by iron-pieces, 5 by wooden splinters, 3 uncertairj, Avhether by shell-fragments or by iron-pieces, and 2 of AAdiich one Avas by a bullet and the other probably by buck-Avheut husks.

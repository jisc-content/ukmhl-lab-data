LACEEATED AND MUTILATED WOUNDS. 352 with that of hullets, the difference is not so striking. Again in the perforating wounds caused liy the shell-fragments, the tissues around the margin of the wounds are found greatly contused, and the skin around the entrance and exit holes is discoloured, while with those of bullets, such is not the case except in an instance of an explosive wound caused by bullets in short range. This is because the gun-shot wounds are caused by such objects as shell-fragments, or iron-pieces irregular in shape and unfit for penetration. The perforating gun- shot wounds have not only a large diameter, but damage the tissues around comparatively severely, so they generally result in instant death when they are inflicted on vital parts as the chest or abdomen, to say nothing of the head, and even on the limbs the character of the wounds is by far more unfavorable than those of bullets ; for in the former, tlie healing process is much prolonged, and during that time wound infections are apt to occur. Though the clinical history does not record it, there were some cases of perforating wounds from whicli pieces of cloth were washed out. When the parts covered with the dress were perforated, there is no doubt that the severed piece of cloth enters the wound in a mass with the shell-fragment, and it will be left within unless it adheres firmly to the fragment and is extracted with it. 6.â€”LACERATED AND IVIUTILATED WOUNDS. The lacerated wound here considered, is strictly speaking that kind of injury in which the body is severed in two, or the head or the hand is entirely torn away, but those wounds in which though a greater part of the chest or abdomen be lacerated, yet both the upper and lower halves of the body having good connection, should he called the half lacerated wounds are included in this category. The mutilated

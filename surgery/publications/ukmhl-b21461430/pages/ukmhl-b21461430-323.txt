255 OF ATTACK OX WEI-HAI-WEL those on the upper deck. Thus, the number of killed and wounded entirely depended on the number of the persons stationed at any place that was hit. On the contrary, during the attack on the Wei-hai-wei forts, the hostile shells mostly came aboard at an acute angle, accord- ingly pLices above the upper deck were mostly struck ; the only shell that pierced through the lower deck being one on the Naniwa (the shells that struck the torpedo-boats came from the hostile vessels near by and are not included in the above). Hence the high casualty among those stationed on the upper deck. The unusual high number of casualties among the stokers was because No. 9 torpedo boat had its boiler broken by a hostile shell during the night attack on Wei- hai-wei, <S stokers were killed or wounded at one time.

These ranks, however, having originally very different numbers of their own, the true rates of injuries can not be ascertained unless considered in comparison with the number of each rank, so in the foot column of table 3 the rate percent of the killed and wounded to the whole number of each rank is computed ; and from this we learn that both under tlie heads of ' Officers and AVarrant Officers' and ' Petty Officers, Seamen and Xoncombatants,' Surgeons and Medical attendants have the largest rate ; next come Officers and Seamen, then Paymasters and their assistants. Engineers and Stokers having the smallest rate. In naval battles, hostile shells do not choose any one place for striking a ship above the water-line : those who are standing on the bridge, or those who are fighting on an open battery or those who are at work on a lower deck, run an equal risk of being struck. So there is no reason for supposing that there would be any difference in the number of injuries between comljatants and noncombatants, as long as they are equally engaged in their duties above the water-line. Thus in the battle of the Yellow sea, the surgeons who were mostly on the lower deck had a comparatively great number of killed and wounded, and the combatant officers and seamen who stund next to them in degree of injuries had likewise a large number of wounded on the lower deck. On the other hand, below the water-line, one is almost always safe, and the only shell that struck below the water line was that which reached the Xaniwa (this knocked through the ship at about L foot below the water line and exploding there the fragments entered the coalbunker without inflicting any injury to pers(3n). It is therefore natural that the engineers and stokers who are always en-

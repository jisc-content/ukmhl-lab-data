244 ON 'J'HE BATTLE OF THE YELLOW SKA. those of the English army in the Crimean war, of which, tilone in foreign wars, there exists a report in which this kind of classification is made. The wounded cases t|iken into hospitals were 11,515, of which 1,775 i.e., 15.41 per cent, died during treatment, 6,729 i.e.. 58.44 recovered, and 3,011 i.e., 26.15 were invalided. AVe see that the rate of subsequent deaths during treatment is about the same as in our service, though the proportions of recovered and invalided are different. As the art of surgery is now much more advanced than it was in the time of the Crimean war, the numbei' of deaths during treatment ought to have shown a great decrease in our army. This apparent similarity of the death rate is attributable to the difference in the nature of the injuries in land fights, and in naval battles on the one hand, and on the other to the fact that in our case, those who ex- pired soon after being wounded were likewise counted under the heading of subsequent deaths, hence this apparent high rate of death. Under this heading of deaths, were counted in this table, not a few cases that died within twenty-four hours after injury. The following shows the time of deaths that occurred within four days of injury, be- fore their admission into the Sasebo Xaval Hospital thus : — Those who died on the day of injury o Those who died within one day after injury ... 11 ,, ,, two days ,, ,, ... (5 ,, thiee ,, ,, ,, ... o „ „ four „ „ „ ... 1 As will be seen from this, the 14 wIkj died within 24 hours of injury form 42.42 per cent, of the 33 deaths during treatment, and if to this be added the 6 deaths that occurred within forty-eight hours of injury, we get 20 deaths, or 60.61 of the total deaths during treat- ment. The whole number of deaths that occurred before admission

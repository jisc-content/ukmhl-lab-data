450 KAK'KE. 2.-C0NSTITUTI0NAL DISEASES. (1) KAK'KE (Beri-beki). Kak'ke is a disease that has existed in the countries of the East from very ancient times. In Chinese medical books, the first mention of it occurs some two hundred years before the Christian era, and in certain medical works of our country published a thousand years ago, the disease is mentioned. It seems that formerly kak'ke much prevailed in China, while it has greatly decreased there of late. The case is just the reverse in our country. Though in Japan the existence of the disease can be traced to a very remote period, it was almost confined up to a few decades ago, to such populous towns as Tokyo, Kyoto, and sea-ports as Nagasaki, etc., where travellers crowded from every part of the country, and had never prevailed over the whole land of the Empire as it is the case at present. As for the cause of this disease, nothing certain is known as yet. Many hold a hypothetical opinion that it is an infectious disease caused by a specific virus (which may be a kind of bacillus not yet ascertained.) This is an opinion that might be expected from the general current of modern theory, and we are not disposed flatly to deny it. Nevertheless, it is our strong belief that the origin of kak'ke is intimately connected with a certain kind of food, and should not be regarded as one of the infectious diseases. In defence of this theory we mention the following circumstance which induced us to improve the scale of diet in our Navy for the special purpose of preventing kak'ke, which change has had remarkable results. Up to the year 1883, our Navy had been greatly harassed by the prevalence of the disease, a large number of the seamen at service both on land

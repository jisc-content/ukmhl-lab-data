DISEASES OF THE KESPIEATOEY SYSTEM. 489 inimerous experiments. Besides, the sudden and striking changes of temperature to which seamen at large have usually to expose them- selves, are far greater than those experienced by men in the army when on march. This also naturally affords a great cause for discuses of the respiratory system, and consequently for phthisis; and this is especial- ly the case with the stokers. Lastly, a ship's crew will often go on shore, and lodge at private houses, and indulge in drinking and other unhygienic practices. This greatly diminishes the resisting power of the body, and thus opens the way for the entrance of the bacilli, which is almost the same as promoting the power of the virus. These heedless practices of the men must be regarded as another great cause of this dreadful disease. Even those who are ordinarily good in deportment, and do not indulge in such unhealthy practices, are apt to lodge at various houses, and otherwise expose themselves to unfavorable circumstances as naval men lead a more unsettled life than men belonw-in"' to the army. In the Navy of Great Britain, the increase of phthisis of late has attracted the notice of several persons. For instances, Captain Rason, R. N., has aroused public attention by writing to the Times, and in 1890 Christopher Harvey, Fleet-Surgeon, R. N., sent a report based on his investigations to the Naval and Military Record. In that report, he writes about bad ventilation and insufficient space in the same way as we have done; and we take the liberty of quoting from it below :â€” " If, then, we have reasonably eliminated the undue effect of climatic influences, always more or less prevailing, to what occult causes can we attribute the undeniably large proportion of lung disease on board training-ships? The hygienic surroundings of a ship, even under the most favourable circumstances, must be very

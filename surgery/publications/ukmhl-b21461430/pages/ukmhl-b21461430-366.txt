CONTUSED WoUXD. 298 the equivalent ratio of wounds caused by shell-fragments, and than 50.00 per cent "which is that of iron-pieces. The reasons why wooden splinters inflict contusions in some cases, and contused wounds in others depend on the following conditions :â€”firstly, difterence of force according to size, even among splinters originally weak in power; secondly, existence of ragged edges; thirdly, the locality of the part struck, for, if the part struck is wanting in soft subcutaneous tissues and so does not allow the skin to yield, it is liable to be rent open and sustain a contused wound, while tlie part which abounds in soft tissues yielding to the pressure will naturally escape rupture. Of 23 wounds as stated just now, 17 were in localities wanting subcutaneous tissues, such as the head, face, fingers, front of the leg and dorsum of the foot, and of the 17 wounds, 12 were on the head and face, none of them, however, was fat;d as would be the case with a shell-fragment or an iron-piece, this proves the weak force of the wooden splinters. I'he 1st example of contused wounds caused by wooden splinters was in the lower part of the left parietal region. The wound was shallow, so that the aponeurosis was not pierced, but paralysis of the right side of the face, tongue, and the upper and lower limbs supervened, and amnesia was present; this was certainly attributable to the injury of the cortical substance of tlie brain around the fissure of Rolando; but what was the nature of it could not be ascertained. In this case the contused wound of the scalp was shallow, and did not pierce the aponeurosis and bone lesion was not found even if it existed, but such a wound, if caiused by a somewliat larger and heavier splinter, might have broken the parietal bone beneath, without the aponeurosis being pierced, and such cracks ma}^ escape observation from the outside. Besides, it may be presumed that one of the anterior branches of the middle meningeal artery, running in the grooves of the inner surface of the parietal bone was ruptured at the same time, and thus an extra-

During the period of the w^ar, there occurred, in 1894, 30 cases of malarial fever, and 116 cases in the following year. According to the districts of their infection, they may be divided into three different classes: those infected in Korea or China, those in Formosan districts, and those affected at home. It is a certain fact that the districts alono; the sea-coasts of Korea and China are malarious. AVhen the w^ar commenced, most of our war-vessels assembled at Kakuon island on the western coast of Korea, the gun-boats lying at anchor close by the shores, and even landing their crews for various business purposes. When Port Arthur and Wei-hai-wei had been taken and the war came to an end, a gun-boat like the Chokai sidled up the river and anchored at Tientsin, where more than 10 of her crew suffered from malarial fever. The types of malarial fever that prevail in China and Korea are various, and their comparative frequency is difficult to ascertain, yet the quotidian and tertian, seem most frequent.

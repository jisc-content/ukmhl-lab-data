KAK'KE. 469 carbo-hydrates, just as alcoholic neuritis is caused hy prolonged excess of alcohol and consequent diminution of comsumption of meat &c. Tlie question requires further investigation ; yet it is beyond doubt that this disease has an inseparable relation with the quantity of nutritious elements in the food. Or, it may be caused by some part- icular poisonous substance existing in rice though not yet discovered. If the outbreak at Richmond Asylum, in Ireland, was truly kak'ke we must say that the disease has no connection witli rice, but depends only in combination of various nutritious ingredients of food. Lastly, it is a well known foct that when a patient affected with kak'ke in one district is removed to some other district, it has a fivorable effect on the cure. Some think this is because the patient is away from the poisonous district, and that the disease is endemic or infectious. l>ut in our opinion, what is good for a disease and what is the cause of the disease are quite different questions. For instance, it is true that patients affected with kak'ke in Tokyo often recover speedily when removed to such mountainous district as Hakone, but if persons who are healthy in Tokyo be sent to Hakone and there be made to live on the same diet as those who were affected with the disease in Tokyo, the pure air of Hakone will not save them from the disease. We therefore come to the following conclusions : â€” (1) The only persons who are attacked by kuk'ke in Eastern countries are those who use rice for their daily food, and on examina- tion, it has been ascertained tliat the nutritious substance of their diet is generally below the physiological standard and that if the diet be improved so that the various nutritious ingredients do not fall below that standard, kak'ke will certainly be prevented before it comes to light. (2) The extirpation of kak'ke in the Japanese ISTavy since the year 1884, is entirely to be attributed to the improvement in the scale

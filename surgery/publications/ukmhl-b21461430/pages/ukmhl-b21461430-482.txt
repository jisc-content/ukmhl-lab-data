410 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. In the Walcheren expedition, England had 1.67 of her troops killed, and 34.69 carried away by disease ; Spain lost 8,889 men killed by the enemy, and 24,930 men by disease, out of a total of 61,511 men. In the Crimean war, the French had about 20,000 men killed, and 75,000 lost by disease, and England lost 4,067 men killed, and 17,580 men through disease. In the Anglo-French expedition against China, out of the 30,000 troops despatched there, 601 men were killed in action, while 4,758 men died of disease. In the Russo- Turkish war, the Russians lost 36,455 men killerl, and 83,446 men through disease. During the Mexican war, among the American forces the killed were 1,180 men, as against 4,925 who died from sickness. With our army in the present war, out of 227,600 soldiers engaged, 1,005 men were killed in action, while 15,860 died of disease. The proportions above enumerated between the numbers of the killed in ac- tion, and those who died from sickness all refer to armies, and therefore can not appropriately be adduced in comparison with figures referring to navies. But our purpose is only to prove the fact that in any kind of war deaths from disease are far more numerous than deaths in action, and that therefore, we may justly claim that the almost equal ratios above demonstrated between these two classes of loss in our Xavy during the present war, must be attributed to the creditable services rendered by the authorities concerned in sanitary matters. l.-INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The total number of infectious diseases during the Japan-China War (July 25th, 1894 to November 17th, 1895) was 420, of which 319 were on the field of war, and the remaining 101 at home stations. Besides the above, there was a certain number of cases of this category occurring among civilian employes, but some of the men having been

ox THE BATTLE OF THE YELLOW SEA. •238 War, the Italian War, the Ivusso-Dnni.sh AVnr, the Austro-Prussian War, the Civil War of Americ:), the Franco-Prussian War and the 1st Division of our army in the Japan-China War, the results are as follows :—Wounded on the head are 50,818, on the trunk 86,618, on the'upper limbs 141,418, on the lower limbs 148,547,-427,401 in all. To compute the percentage of I'espective injuries, the head has 11.89, the trunk 20.27, the upper limbs 33.09, the lower limbs 34.75, Those killed outright on the fields of battle are not counted in this number, as the localities of the injuries, received by those killed on the spot are often doubtful and can not be adduced as reliable evidence. HoM-ever, if we venture a calculation about the killed as for as reports of such exist,—that is, about 118 killed in the New Zealand war of England, 387 in the Russo-Danish war, 1,173 in the American Civil war, and 119 of the 1st Division of oin* army in the Japan-China war—the percentage will be seen to be 40.24 of the head, 53.97 of the trunk, 1.79 of the upper limbs, 4.00 of the lower limbs. The proportion between the killed and wounded varies with each war. Thus in the battles of Alma and Inkerman in 1854 and the attack on Plevna in 1878, the number of the killed, and that of the wounded on the side of the Russians, was nearly equal, while with the French at the same battle of the Alma the rate was 8.3 of wounded to 1 of killed. Such variations will naturally occur according to the character of the battle and the nature of the field occupied. However, according to Long- more's calculation, based upon 100 battles, the average proportion of the killed and wounded is 1 of the former to 4 of the latter. If we calculate the foregoing numbers of the various injuries to the killed and of the wounded together, the percentage will be thus : injuries to head 17.56, trunk 27.01, upper limbs 26.83, lower limbs 28.60. Judging- from mere fig^ures, the lower limbs i-eceived the largest nuni-

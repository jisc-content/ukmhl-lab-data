Takano then in tlie engine room, and a man of the fire brigade, then on the middle part of starboard side of the lower deck. Moreover, an ammunition supplier, then in the after cock-pit on the lowest deck, got contused by a falling piece of the severed brass rod belonfjino;' to the rail of the hatch.

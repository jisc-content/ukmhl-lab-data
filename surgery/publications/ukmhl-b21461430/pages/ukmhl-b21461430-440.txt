In degree, the burns were mostly su|3erlic):il, though in some ]'arfs, covered with clothes, it w;is otherwise. The burned surfaces were geijerally blackened by powder-fumes and unconsumed po\\ (ler. and the hair was much singed.

Patients of this class admitted to hospital numbered 43 in all. Of them 11 Avere only slightly burned and admitted to hospital for other and more serious Avounds. The remaining 32 persons entered hospital on account of burns alone, or of burns attended Avith other slighter Avounds.

Tliongh the cases of the bnnis placed under the care of tlie liospital differed much in burnt area, they were almost all the same in other respects, I need ]iot therefore record the particulars of each case, but shall merely indicate tlie locali-

SUPPURATION. 388 that is, Avlietber the nerve was contused or lacerated hut inferring from the position of the wound orifice, it is beyond doubt that at any rate the nerve was injured by a she]l-frn,gment, and we believe that this is not one of the cases very rarely met with in which, owing to irregular development of callus, a nerve is compressed so as to suffer functional derangement. Therefore, Avith Avound sustained in parts having a trunk of nerve, it is importarit that the inside of the wound should be at once examined, in oixler to ascertain Avhether the nerve is safe or not; and if it be found lacerated such measures as nerve sutur- ing should be taken bef )re the nei've undergoes degeneration. 3.-SUPPURATI0N. In the case of patients so heavily injured in the engagement of the Yellow sea, as to need hospital treatment at home, the wounds were almost all found suppurating when received into the hospital. Ample provisions had been made before the commencement of the war to pre- vent suppuration by strict attention to antiseptic measures. The re- sult was therefore quite contrary to our expectation, but much though we regret it, it could not be helped under the circumstances at tliat time. Shell wounds are frequently heavy, and always of a lacerated na- ture, so that tissues around the Avound usually sustain serious contu- sion : the tissues of the afflicted surfxce lose their vitality, and Avith it their power to resist Jiiicro-organism, and thus even a few micrococci multiply at once and bring on suppuration. This is a fact long as- certained by experience. Moreover, the tissues around the wound are torn irregularly, so that extremely irregular cavities being thus formed, which once invaded by microorganism, cannot easily be sterilized.

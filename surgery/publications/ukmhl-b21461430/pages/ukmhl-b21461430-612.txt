540 THE HOSPITAL AT THE EXPEDITION BASE. The above mentioned wounded captive was found by Director General Saneyoshi, of the Navy Medical Bureau, while he was, after the fall of the Pascadores, inspecting- the sanitary conditions of Makun town. The captive was lying prostrate on the ground suffering from a perforating wound on the chest; he was taken on board the ship and after treatment, had the happiness of returning home completely re- covered.

However, during the war, more than 20 transports in the service of the Navy were constantly plying between the fields of battle and home, so that there existed great facilities for transportation as well as communica- tion.

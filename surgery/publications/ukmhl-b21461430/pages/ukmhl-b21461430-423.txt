LACERATED AND MUTILATED WOUNDS. 355 leer, and contused wounds on the head and the left hand. This was cured in 3 months. (jSTo. 230.) (4) Eight lacerated wounds produced in the neighborhood of the shell explosion occurred in six persons. Of these, two were on the abdomen, two on the chest, one on the chest and abdomen, two on both lower limbs, and one on the left thigh and the light leg, all of which were killed instantaneously. However, the case of lacerated wound of the chest and abdomen, tirst having sustained a contused wound on the right leg was undergoing operation in the surgery, Avlien a shell exploded in the room and he was killed on the spot. (No. 154.) The lacerated wounds now stated, are chietiy attributable to fragments of exploded shells, but they may be regarded to have been accompained with injuries by iron or wooden pieces or explosion gas, as these persons when wounded were stationed close by the place of shell explosion, wliere it may naturally be expected that various frag- ments of iron and wood would be driven about. In the clinical his- tory of these cases of instant death, only the chief wounds were record- ed to the exclusion of the smaller ones, and it was thought not ,proper to attribute them all to shell-fragments, so they have been classed under the head of wounds by the explosion of shells. The two w^ounds of the chest, and the two of the lower limbs both occurred in two per- sons, each sustained lacerated wounds in the chest and the lower limb. One of these occurred on the Matsushima, when an enormous shell of 30.5 cm. exploded, and set on fire a large amount of ammunition (No. 152.), and the other on the Hiyei, when a hostile shell exploded against the stanchion near by, and set On fire the powder bag that he had hung on his breast. His chest was terribly lacerated, and at the same time the lower limbs were severed from his body, moreover his whole body was almost burned black. (No. 153.) All other cases

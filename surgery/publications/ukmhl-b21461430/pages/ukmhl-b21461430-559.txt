DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATOEY SYSTEM. 487 the Surgeons Service Regulations should he (^hserved as carefally as circumstances will admit." On October 3rd, 1899, the Minister of the Navy promulgated the following instructions :—" In our Navy, there has been observed of late an increasing frequency in the number of phthisical patients. This is a matter of reo^ret as it is a blow to the streng'th of our Navv- Now, as phthisis is chronic in its nature, it is infectious in a slow and insiduous way.

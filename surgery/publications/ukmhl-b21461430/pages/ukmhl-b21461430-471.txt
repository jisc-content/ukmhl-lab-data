SUEGERY TX THE SHIP. 899 is a, hindrance to snccessful treatment. For instance, tlie treatment of the Avounded man (No. 148 clinical history) discussed in tlie chapter on ha3morrhao-e, where hoBmorrhao^e was recoo-nised to he heavy at tirst. If there had been then only one snrp;ery and consequently two sur- geons in it, one of them ])rohahlv would have had time enough to enlarge the wound orifice, remove the pieces of smashed bone, and examining the condition of the artery to apply a ligature to it. l>ut the surgeons being separated, one of them could not spare much time to a single patient, and accordingly such an insufficient method as applying a compress to the w^ound orifice Avas resorted to. The fact that many other Avounds afterAvards suppurated, Avas pro- bably greatly due to tlie impossibility of giving any thing more than temporary relief at the first. This separating of the surgeries may be unavoidable, but it is necessarily attended with great drawbacks ; if a single surgery could be placed in the middle of the ship Avhere persons wounded at varrious parts could con- veniently be collected, and at a place beloAv the water-line least exposed to the danger from shells, it might then be called a suitable one. As Avas already discussed in the last chapter, the character of AYOunds, and conditions in ships during the battle, Avere all so un- favorable that unless managed most carefidly and strictly, tlie wounds could hardly escape suppuration, and even the Avhole of the medical attendants in one place Avould not liave proved sufficient, therefore, the disadvantage of diA^iding them is too obvious to need further argu- ment. Places appropriated for a surger^^ or surgeries in respective ships are as follows : — The Yoshino—Starboard side in the fore part on the loAver deck; and the wai-d- room, in the after part on the lower deck. The Naniwa—Ward-room, in the after part on tlie lower deck.

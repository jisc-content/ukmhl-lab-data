The following is the description of the relations between the causative objects and the wounds. l.-CONTUSION. (1) Nineteen cases of contusion were caused by shell tragments, but the persons actually injured were only 14 in number, as some of them received two or three contusions at a time. They were all slight cases of ecchymosis or small hiematoma. A few cases of some interest will be given below :— Isfc example.—Case of contusion of the chest attended by simple fracture of the cartilage of the left 3rd rib. This healed in due time with no signs of injury to the internal organs nor any other bad sequence. (See clinical history No. 225.)

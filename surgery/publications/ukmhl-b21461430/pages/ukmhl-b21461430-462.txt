SUPPURATIOX. 390 the ships in agitation; and every thing is filled with the dust and dirt of an engagement. Amidst such conditions, it was almost impossible to preserve the wounded surfaces from being soiled. The clinical history does not record many wounds in which a piece or pieces of cloth remained within. But considering the shape of the objects causing shell-wounds, it seems very likely that a piece of cloth or some torn fibres should be carried into the wounds, not only in blind wounds, but in perforating or contused wounds, in parts covered with clothes ; and if such a piece be carried deep into a wound, its surface being very irreguLir, removal of the piece is extremely diffi- cult. This becomes another cause of the wound being liable to con- tamination. The circumstances of the time and the nature of the wounds combined to make suppuration easy ; and a wound once sup- purated is very difficult to stop. Moreover in most ships, with a few exceptions, two surgeries were provided one fore and one aft ; each surgery had only one surgeon assisted by one or two nurses, and when Avounded persons Avere carried in, one after another, no proper treat- ment could be given owing to the insufficiency of hands. Even if a larger staif had been provided, it Avould have been impossible to give much time to a single patient, for numerous patients might be brought in at any moment. During the battle therefore urgent and temporary measures only, could be taken, and on the evening when the engagement was over, each patient was for the fii'st time properly treated according to the nature of his AA^ounds. At this time un- doubtedly, the best care possible Avas taken for the disinfection of the wounds and surrounding parts ; but as the ordinary process of disinfection is, as has been said, insufficient, so the precautions taken did not come up to the degree actually required, l^esides, Avhen one or two cases of suppuration had appeared, circumstances forbade tlieir

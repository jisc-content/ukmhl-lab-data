OTHER DISEASES OF THE EESPIRATOEY SYSTEM. 491 Thus it is to overcrowding, or, if the expression be preferred,, to imperfect ventilation, that I attribute the remote cause, and to the climatic influences the immediately exciting cause of diseases of the lungs on board the Lion."

The number of cases comprised under this group was only 44 in all. The 5 cases of valvular diseases were as follows :â€”1 case of re- gurgitation of the mitral valve which ended in death, 1 case of mitral stenosis which was still under treatment, 3 cases of regurgitation of the aortic valve, of which 1 being a recurrence was convalescing for a time, but finally ended in death at the hospital, the other two also re- sulting in death. All these cases occurred among combatants; that is, 1 seaman, and 4 petty-officers, wdth one of w^hom the disease was recurrent. The other heart diseases, numbering 12, were mostly cases of palpitation, which totalled 10 cases; and as for their termination, 9

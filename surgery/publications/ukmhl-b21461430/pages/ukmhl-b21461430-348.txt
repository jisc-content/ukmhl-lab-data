CONTUSION. 280 However, the absurdity of the wind-ball theory has been made so plain by facts and experiments, that there is scarcely left ground for harbour- ing any belief in it, and so the present case can not be considered as an instance of tlie so called wind-ball wounds. Besides, durinsr the late war there were many instances in which no injury was sustained in spite of the close passage of shells. In default however of a clearly- ascertained evident cause for this case, we can venture on a supposition by taking into consideration tlie circumstances at the time of injury. Several persons who were engaged in firing the same q. f. gun were all seriously wounded at the same moment. One had both his thighs nearly severed, nnd was thrown down into the hammock netting by the shock, and died instantaneously. The second man was also killed on the spot having the pelvis and right thigh multilated. The third man sustained a perforated wound on the left shoulder and a penetrating- wound on the neck. The last, two men and the person now in ques- tion were found stretched on the deck and g'roanino-. From these considerations we infer that the injured man in question may reasonab- ly have received contusion of the eye-balls by colliding heavily with one of the other wounded persons, or by being struck on the face by a limb or the body of another. It is true that this theory can not be supported by evidence as the injured man did not remember the con- ditions at the time of injury; but seeing that there was left no trace of lesion on the face, we can not hut infer that the eyes were heavily compressed or hit by something soft. Besides the ab(jve, among those killed instantaneously on board the Hiyei and Matsushima, there were cases of serious contusion in which though the skin remained intact, yet the soft tissues beneath were extensively reduced to a pulpy mass and the bone pulverized, so that when the part was touched it gave the sensation of touching an

537 THE HOSPITAL OF THE KURE PORT ADMIRALTY. 2.-THE HOSPITAL OF THE KURE PORT ADMIRALTY. Of the wounded men in battle, one was sent straight to this Hospital and thirty-six were transferred from the Sasebo Naval Hospital, numbering thirty-seven in all; the wounded by accidents and the sufferers from diseases, admitted to the Hospital in the course of the war, were 1,067 in number.

The project of the Society had the cordi;il approval of Madame Arichi, wife of the Commander-in-Chief of this Port Admiralty, and by her influence, many ladies of the port joined, and gave their best assistance. Thus the branch of the above men- tioned nursing society was newly organized at this port just after the declaration of the war, and then the wives and daughters of the petty officers and seamen were invited to join them. They were engaged every day in the art of nursing the wounded and the sick. The number of members was no less than 174 by the end. When the wounded were received into the Hospital, the members were allowed by daily turns to attend the Hospital, 15 each day and to serve therefrom 8 a.m. till the noon in the changing of bandages and the preparation of dressing materials.

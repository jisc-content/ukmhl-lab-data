What was the actual form of the fragment, can of course not be ascertained now, yet as shell-fragments have as a rule irregular shapes, with several edges, and are never so round and smooth as bullets, we can easily imagine that the shell-fragment that produced the wound in question was likewise of an irregular shape. The {act that the wound in the forehead was almost round, and that the inner as well as the outer plates sustained no cracks, proves that the shell-fragment was very weak in force. Even with bullets, they produce such simple lesions to bone when they come from a great dis- tance, and with greatly impaired velocity. For the same reason, it seems that this fragment being weak in force, could scarcely penetrate the frc^ntal bone, but as it spent all its f)rce, it stopped near the dura mater without injuring the brain substance. There may occnsionally be cases of no occurrence of cerebral symptoms even when the frontal lobes were injured, but in the present case the fragment seems not to have entered the cranial cavity as no foreign body was found after the trephining. . At any rate, it is very strange that no brain symptoms occurred for some days after injury. But unfortunately the wound fell into suppuration and an abscess was formed in the skull, from which the patient died, the operation proving ineffective. The instances of the presence of pieces of cloth in the wounds' were ISTos. 10, 12, 14, 23, and 28. In 3 of these cases, the shell- fragments had pieces of cloth sticking to one side only. It can easily be seen that this is not only the case with the shell-fragment, but also with an iron or wooden [)iece having a very ii-regular shape and coarse sui'face, when striking a part covei-ed with cloth ;. and in most of the blind wounds received in those parts of the body covered with

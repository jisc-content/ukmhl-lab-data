INTRODUCTION. In the Japan-China War during 1894â€”5, the naval battles of Phung-do and Yalu, the attacks of the Japanese upon Tan-chow, Wei-hai-wei, the Pescadores, and those upon Keelung, Takau, and Anping in Formosa were the principal engagements ; our bombard- ments of Hwa-yuan-kow, Talien Bay, Port Arthur, and Yingching Bay may be also reckoned as sea-fights of importance. The description of the general conditions of the war, that is, the force and movements of our squadron and those of the Chinese fleet &c., naturally belong to other public documents, and do not come within the scope of this history. Only a few remarks will be made therefore, with regard to the general engagements themselves : the condition of the killed and wounded in the various actions and diseases and injuries in general will alone be fully described in the book.

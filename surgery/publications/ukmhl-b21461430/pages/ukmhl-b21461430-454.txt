382 H^MOERHAGE. impossible to do so (farther reference to this will be made in the next chapter.) In shell wounds of all other parts, when blood vessels smaller than middle sized are injured, haemorrhage is not heavy, and it will almost always stop of its own accord, if dressings are apphed. But in cases of injury of the intercostal vessels, the pressure given by the application of dressings does not reach the vessels, and the blood coming out of these arteries flows into the pleural cavity, and does not have such a fevorable effect in procuring the coagulation of blood as is the case with the haemorrhasfe of other blood vessels, in which the blood coagulating by degrees in the tissues and increasing the internal pressure of tissues, f ivors further coagulation. Accordingly, hgemor- rhage may naturally last till the time of death, and in such cases it is needless to say that timely ligature of the injured vessels is of the ut- most importance. (2) Secondary htemorrage. It lias been argued that Avith shell wounds produced by any cause, the tissues are destroyed, the marginal tissues contused, so that sloughing layers are most liable to be produc- ed at the edges. When the slouo;hs come off the blood vessels having also sustained contusion, haemorrhage may probably set in, even though it did not take place at first. I^ut strangely enough, in the late war there occurred almost no secondary htemorrhage. The only case in which any secondary h-cemorrliage may be said to have taken place in the patients admitted, is the case of No. 225. During his sleep at night, hiEmorrhage occurred from the small wound on the temple, which was rather profuse in (piantity, but owing to prompt ligature of the vessels, it was directl}^ staunched, before anything serious had occurred. This was the only case of secondary hsemorrhage among the patients in the hospital, and tlie interval between the reception of injury and admission being mostly 8 or -1 days, none probably

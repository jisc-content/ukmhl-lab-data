To obviate this, the fol- lowing table was framed by counting each injury as an independent one, whether slight or grave ; according to its locality. TABLE NO. XVll. Locality of in juki'.

Sucii are counted as a single wound collectively, to avoid possible error that may occur from arbitrarily assigning a luunlier. 'I'iie percentage of tlie injuries botli in the battles of the \ ellmv sett and at Wei-hai-wei as shown in this table, presents following rates : — the head 28.25, the trunk 15.2-1, the upper limbs 26.22, the lower limbs 30.28. When the injuries of each locality are considered, in comparison with the relative area of the wliole body, then the percent- ages are as follows: the head is 1 G.oo to 1 unit of area, the trunk 2.59, the upper limbs 6.10, and the lower limbs o.60, so that a strik- ingly larger rate in the head is followed successively by the upper and lower limbs, and the trunk. Yiew^ed in any way, in the late naval battle, the head suffered with especial severity. Whether this is attributable to the frequency of \'arious projectiles falling from above or to some other circumstances, can not easily be accounted for, unless further evidence be brought forth.

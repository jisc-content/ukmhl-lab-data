Consequently the other conditions of life being the same we naturally sought the cause of the disease first in the diet. Accordingly, in February 1884, a resolution for the improvement of the scale of diet was passed, nnd so the former method of paying in cash was now substituted by that of supply of substance, and at the same time the prr-gramme of daily ratios per man was fixed as follows:— Rice 648 grammes (or 600 Meat 300 gms. grammes of bread, or 490 Miso 50 ,, grammes of sea biscuit) Flour (wheat) 75 ,, Fish 150 gms. Beans 45 ,, A-'egetables 450 ,, Pickled vegetables 75 ,, Milk 45 „ Sugar 75 ,, In addition to the above, 60 grammes of " Shoyu " (a. kind of pea sauce), 15 grammes of fat, 8 grammes of salt, tea and vinegar and 90 grammes of " sake " (a Japanese liquor) were to be supplied. The nutritious value of the above diet is equal to 775 grammes of carbo-hydrates, 43 grammes of fat, and 196 grammes of albuminous substance and was without doubt a remarkable improve- ment on the former one. In the first year of this innovatiori, that is, 1884, hindered by various circumstances, this change was not fully put in force, arid yet its effect was plainly recognized by a remarkable decrease of the number of kak'ke patients duririg that year. Ever since concurrent with the enforcement of the improved plan, the disease, if not completely extirpated, has been brought under control, and the number of patients were so few that we were scarcely troubled with them.

KAK'KE. 471 1 (9) Our observations about kak'ke in Japan and the East, show that it has always an inseparable connection with the use of rice in comparatively larger quantities together with a lack of other nutritious substances, i. e. albuminous and fatty substances. On the other hand, its prevalence in a lunatic asylum in Ireland, constrains us to think that the disease may occur without the use of rice. (10) If we use proper diet, kak'ke will certainl3^be prevented at any season in any place ; neglect of dietary precautions will always be followed by an outbreak of this disease. (11) We can enumerate several examples of toxic form of mul- tiple neuritis due either to inorganic or vegetable substances exclusive of micro-organisms, such as arsenical neuritis lately occurred in Man- chester and several other places in the north of England, or neuritis caused by lead, alcohol, ergot, morphine &c. Forty cases of Kak'ke occurred during the war, and three men died, the ratio of cases per 100 of force being 0.27. The thirty two cases of Kak'ke occurred on board the following vessels, viz : The Takachiho (12), Matsushima (;-5), Atago (8), Omi-maru (2), Akashi-maru (2), Akitsushima (1), Katsuragi (1), Yamato (1), Tenryu (1), Kaimon (1), Maya (1), Shinagawa-maru (1), Genkai-maru (1), Yedo-maru (1), and Genzan-maru (1). The eight others occurred at the following shore stations, viz : the JSTaval Barracks of Kure (3), of Sasebo (2), of Yokosuka (1), of Port Arthur (1), and the Base station of Longreach in Korea (1). As already mentioned, an improvement in the scale of diet was effected after 1884 and this disease diminished consequently year after year, until it was nearly extirpated in Navy. The disease, however broke out afresh ; the following will account for it. In April 1894, the Takachiho was despatched to Hawaii and as soon as she returned, she was repaired with extraordinary speed, and sailed

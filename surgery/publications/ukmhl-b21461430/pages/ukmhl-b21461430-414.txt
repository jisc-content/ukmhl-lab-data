PERFORATED WOUXDS. 346 The perforated wounds of the chest are the Nos. 3, 4, G, 11 and 26, occurring in 6 persons, each of whom was killed on the spot. The sizes of these wounds have not been ascertained, but considering that as a rule a small shell-fragment can rarely inflict a perforated wound, we shall be able to imagine what the sizes were. According to the experiences of former days Avhen bullets of a larger calibre were used, perforated wounds of the chest, almost always terminated in death. It was therefore cpiite to be expected that the present six cases should all have resulted in instant death. The perforated wounds of the abdomen are six in number as shown in the 12th, 14th, loth, 19th, 23rd and 24th instances, all of which, except the 23rd, resulted in death. Two of them were cases in which the lumber vertebrge were crushed, and in another the injur- ed man was thrown overboard. The 23rd case died 8 hours after in- jury. Thus it will be seen that perforated wounds of the abodomen have a very unfavorable prognosis. As already discussed under the heading of penetrating wounds, the abdomen is a part liable to penetra- ting wounds from large shell-fragments, leaving a comparatively small wound aperture. The sizes of the perforated wounds were mentioned only in instance No. 23, but it can easily be seen that the shell frag- ments producing them were not small ; for a. shell-fragment which produces a pei'forating wound is naturally stronger in force than that inflicting a penetrating one. Thus, in the case when a shell-fragment, not small, and having an irregular and rugged shape penetrates the abdominal cavity, not only are the viscerns injured, but the vessels and nerves are also liable to lesion, and consequently instant death is the natural result in most cases, owing to a sevei-e shock or internal hiemorrhage. The prognosis is incomparably more unfavorable than that of bullet wounds. Cases like iSro. 23 which in spite of the serious

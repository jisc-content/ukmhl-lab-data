10 in the Y'oshino, 2 in the Takachiho, 14 in the Akitsushima, 28 in CHAPTEE III. STATISTICS OF INJURIES. The total numljer of the killed and wounded in the late war between Japan and China was 371, of which 6 cases occurred in the battle of Phung-do, 298 at the Yellow sea, 66 at A\'ei-hai-wei and 1 at the Pescadores. The six cases in the battle of Phung-do were not attributable to hostile shells, but to the shock of their own guns at the time of firing, or to the gas produced by the explosion of the gun- powder, and one man at the fight of the Pescadores was wounded by an enemy's bullet while serving as a landing party ashore, so in these two engagements none on board our war-ships sustained any injury. We do not therefore see any necessity to record these seven cases in a separate statistic. The statistics recorded in the present chapter will only refer to the killed and wounded in the battles of the Yellow sea and AVei-hai-wei. l.-ON THE BATTLE OF THE YELLOW SEA.

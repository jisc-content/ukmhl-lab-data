525 WAEMIXG OF WARD-ROOMS, GUN-ROOMS, ETC. the washing could only be performed on a bright warm day, and not as often as regulated. With regard to drying after the decks had been washed, the lower decks were wiped with hot water, and then dried by air sent through wind-sails, or by drying stoves. After a rain-fall, the lower berths were ventilated by letting air through the open scuttles and wind-sails, after the wet things had been taken on the upper decks. 5.-WARIV1ING OF WARD-ROOMS, GUN-ROOMS, ETC. Stoves were provided in most ships. In two or three ships as the Yoshino and Naniwa, the cabin, ward-room, and gun-room were each furnished with a steam-heater, so that no stove was required, but where there was no heating apparatus, stoves were used, and also fire braziers. The g^as and smoke from the stove was conducted throucjh the chimney on the upper deck or the scuttles, l)ut as this was impossible with the fire-braziers, carbon dioxide was liable to accumulate, and therefore great care was taken in ventilation by opening and shutting the scuttles and hatches. If fire-braziers are used, and care is paid to ventilation they are perfectly harmless, but with insufficient ventilation poisoning from carbonic acid gas is liable to occur. According to the reports on the present war, fire-braziers were much used besides stoves, but owing to strict observance of ventilation as well as of the hours in which the fire was kept alive—that is, from the time of rising to going to bed—poisoning was almost completely avoided. The only case of poisoning occurred on the Hashidate. On the night of January 4th, 1895, in order to melt the oil of a torpedo-machine that had frozen, fire was kept alive in braziers in the fore torpedo-room of the lowest deck, and on this occasion those who slept in the room were poisoned with the carbon dioxide thus produced.

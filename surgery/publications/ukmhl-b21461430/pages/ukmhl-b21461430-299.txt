231 ox THE BATTLE OF THE YLLLOW SEA. As will be seen from table Xo. 4, if we name the ships in order of the ratio of their killed and wounded to the number of shells re- ceived, the Matsushima stands foremost, followed successively by the Akitsushima, Itsukushima, Hiyei, Fuso, Yoshino, Hashidate, Akagi, Saikyo-maru, and Takachiho, while the Xaniwaand Chiyoda sustained no injury to life from enemy's shells. But if we consider merely the number of the shells received, the Akagi has the largest number, the Hiyei, Matsushima, Saikyo-maru, Hashidate and Xaniwa succeeding; then the Itsukushima, Fuso, and Yoshino, these three having the same number, after which the Takachiho, Akitsushima, Chiyoda follow^ in order. As however the rate of the killed and wounded bears no exact proportion with the number of shells received, we are presented with a phenemenon such as is shown by the ' ratio of the killed and wounded to each shell received.' This is attributable to the fact that the shells received were of various sorts, some being those of heavy guns and some of light guns, of which some exploded while others did not; and also some that were no more than mere fragments, so that the degrees of damages sustained w^ere very ditferent. Tiie case in which the heaviest damao-es were inflicted and the lari^est number w^ere killed and injured at a time by the explosion of a shell, Avas that of a 30.5 cm. shell that exploded on the lower deck of the ^^latsushima, by which 30 were killed outright and 70 injured at once (about half the number by explosion of the ammunition of the ship). A shell that exploded in the Avardnjom of the Hiyei killed 14 and wounded 26; a 21 cm. ordinary shell that burst on the upper deck of the Aki- tsushima killed 5 and wounded 8; a similar shell that burst in the fore torpedo room of the Itsukushima killed 8 and injured 3. And in the Itsukushima even the explosion of a 50 m.m. light-gun shot killed 4 and hurt G. On the contrary, a 30.5 cm. shell that fairly

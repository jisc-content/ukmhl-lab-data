Thus, the foundation of a new scale of diet was laid, which has since then been in operation. However, the old system of allowing in cash remaining in force as before, when the price of commodities rose, it proved difficult to buy the fixed quantity of food. Consequently, on February 12th, 1890, the Naval Diet Regulations were promulgated, followed by a by-law concerning the supply. These were made public on March 28th, and thus the old system was done away with for the new system, which was put in force from April 1st of the same year. During the present war, therefore, diet was supplied in accordance to the new regulations.

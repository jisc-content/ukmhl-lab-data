539 THE HOSPITAL SHIP. Nagasaki for Longreach, Korea, the rendezvous of our expedition squadron at that time, and after this she constantly followed the track of'the squadron, receiving and treating the sick and wounded, not only from the Navy hut also some from the Army. When she started on the southern expedition in March 1895, thirty hired sick berth attendants were added to her staff. At the end of the month when she had arrived at the Pescadores, there broke out an epidemic of cholera in a transport belonging to the Army, which immediately spread among the soldiers landed on the islands. So, isolation hospitals were constructed at the towns of Riseikaku and Makun on the islands, and naval surgeons, sick berth attendants, etc., from the squadron and transports, worked ardently for the relief of the patients, yet the suf- ferers increased greatly in number every day, and the want of medical aid was keenly felt. During this emergency, the surgeons on board this hospital ship landed with sick berth attendants and gave their services, and later on, thirty six additional sick berth attendants were temporarily hired, and employed in tending the sufferers on board the ship as well as on the land. From the outbreak of the cholera on the islands till its disappearance, the total number of cases was 1,922, of which only three were seamen of the Navy, all the rest were soldiers and coolies belonging to the Army. During the course of the expedi- tion (August 1894 to August 1895), the total number of patients received in the ship was 696, of whom ninety Avere men wounded in actions of the Navy and Army, one was a Chinese captive wounded in the battle of the Pescadores, and the remaining 605 were sick and wounded otherwise than in action. It was a matter of ffreat reo-ret that she could not discharge her most important duty during the engagement of the Yalu, as, just at the time, she was stationed in the base of Longreach far distant from the scene of the battle.

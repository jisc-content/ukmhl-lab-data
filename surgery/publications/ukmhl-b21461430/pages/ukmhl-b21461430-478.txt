In the hospitals, we resorted to the conservjitive surgery as much as we ccjuld : amputation or resection for compound fractures or injuries to the joints was avoided whenever possible : and this treatment was mostly at- tended with favorable results. The only cases in Avhich amputa- tion was performed were 3 :—No. 270 clinical history, in which the lower part of the left thigh Avas amputated; No. 22-4:, for which amputation of the middle part of the left arm Avas pei'formed, and No. 261, in which the upper part of the right thigh was amputated. The last of these died after operation. For the lotion of burns, solutions of carbolic acid and boracic acid were employed; sometimes j)owders or <)intmeiits of boracic acid, iochjform and salicylic acid ; but it was Ibund extremely difficult to keep the Avounded parts clean. Great pain Avas complained of at the time of changing the dressings, which A\ere accordingly renewed as rarely as possible. But as it happened to be the hottest season of the year, maggots Avere frequently produced under the dressings, Avhich had then necessarily to be rencAved pretty often in spite of the pain.. With the purpose of preventing the stick- ing of dressings to the burned surface, the part Avas tirst Avashed, then fenestrated oiled paper Avas placed on it, with gauze or cotton avooI ]>ut over it. ljut this proved to be unsatisfactory, for the discharge Avould accumulate under the oiled paper.

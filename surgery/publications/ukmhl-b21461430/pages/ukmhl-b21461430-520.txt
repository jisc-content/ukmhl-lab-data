448 vAcciXATioy. * (before the war) a man belonging to Torpedo-boat station at Tsushima was attacked with small-pox, and a stoker of the Kaimon with vario- loid. After this, no case occurred during the war. Of the aforesaid nine cases, those of genuine variola were three, the remaining 6 cases being varioloid. Of these three patients, one was probably infected at Kobe, where the disease was prevaihng when he happened to pass through on his way to the Kure Xaval Barracks from his home. The re-vaccination regulation had to be suspend- ed in this case as the man was seized with the disease, soon after his entrance to the barracks.

With him, the disease was of a mild nature, and he was able to leave hospital four weeks after, completely recovered. The third patient was attacked by the disease, while on board a torpedo- boat staying in Kobe harbour, where the disease was then prevailing. He was said to have been vaccinated four years before with success, followed by two unsuccessful re-vaccinations. He recovered in three weeks. Of the six cases of varioloid, we can learn from records that two men had clear marks of vaccination, and that: re-vaccination had no effect. The other four were re-vaccinated at the time of enlistment, but the existence of vaccination marks is not mentioned -in their records. The total number of small-pox cases that occurred in the whole country during the same five years was 92,990, of which 24,592 resulted in death,—that is, the rate of mortality being 26.44 to every 100 patients. During the two years 1892—^3, the disease assumed an

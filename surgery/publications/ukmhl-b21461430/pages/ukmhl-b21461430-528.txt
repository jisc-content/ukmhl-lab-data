The fact that the introduction of barley into the prison diet had almost ex- tirpated kak'ke was suggested to the military authorities who accord- ingly tried the scheme with the result that the disease began in 1885 to decrease and at last the rates of cases per 1,000 of the force was reduced to less than 10. Subsequently barley was used in barracks at various places, and at the present day it is universally used in the Army, and kak'ke cases are becoming rare. As will be seen from the above table, there were many cases of the disease among the soldiers stationed in Okinawa, that is, the Loochoo islands. Kak'ke is not prevalent in these islands in fact we have never heard of a native

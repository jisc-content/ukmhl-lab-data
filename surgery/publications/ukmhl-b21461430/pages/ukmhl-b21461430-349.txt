281 ABEASED WOUNDS. ice-bag. Such cases were noticed by the surgeons concerned, but they were so busily engaged in the treatment of the Avounded that they could not aiford to do more than merely record the wounds deemed to be the chief cause of death. These wounds however Avere mostly on the thighs, and Avere probably caused by bloAA^s from the obtuse sur- face of large shell-fragments or of pieces of iron or Avood. 'Ihese wounds are not unfrequently met with in naval Avarfare, and it must ha,ve been a matter of mere chance, that no instance of this kind oc- curred among the AVOunded persons Avho remained alive at the end of the action. As Ave have above mentioned, there are 59 cases of contusion, of which 19 Avere caused by the shell-fragments ; 5 by metal fragments; 17 by Avooden splinters ; 14 by bloAvs sustairied from being knocked doAvn by the shock of shell-explosion ; 3 by compression or fall oAving to the shock of firing guns, and 1 the cause of Avhich has not been ascertained. In naval battles, it is natural that a great many injuries should be occasioned by the above enumerated causes. jSTotAvithstanding this fact, 59 cases of this class shoAv a ratio of only 9.38 per cent out of 629 cases of all injuries ;â€”a ratio much less than might have been expected. But this is probably OAving to the fact that serious con- tusions accompanying other fatal wounds Avere not recorded, and also that cases of slight contusions escaped notice as they Avere not re- ported for treatment. 2- ABRASED WOUNDS, GUTTER WOUNDS, WOUNDS ATTENDED WITH LOSS OF SOFT TISSUES.

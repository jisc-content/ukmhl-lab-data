The mortalities from injuries to other parts including both instant and subsequent deaths come as follows : abdomen and loins 80.77 per cent, head 60.47, neck 50.00, chest and back 39.lo, lower limbs 24.49, upper lindjs 2.00, various parts of the body and face no death, and 1 death in the column upper limbs was attributable to erysipelas from accidental infection.

The cases of instant deaths in the 1st Division of our army in the Japan China war may be arranged as follows : the injuries of the head take up 50.42 per cent, of the neck 5.04, of the chest 31.93, of the

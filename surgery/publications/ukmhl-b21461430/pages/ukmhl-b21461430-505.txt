It may seem that this had no direct relation with our Navy, but at the time of an expedition, the army and navy have on most cases to act ;is one body, assisting each other. For instance, at the landing of troops, the navy affords them assistance ; transports belonging to the army have naval officers of superintendence on board accompanied by signal-men ; and after the occupation of Port Arthur and Tahlien bay all affairs concerning the harbours were taken into the hands of the navy; and consequently such business as establishing a quarantine station for soldiers and coolies in transport belonging the army naturally came under the duties of Navy Surgeons as w^ell as of those in the Army.

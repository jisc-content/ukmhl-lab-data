314 BLIND AND PEXE'l'RAl'IXG WOUXDS. case with 'No. 11 in wliicli a lacerated wound 15 cm, lono" and 5 cm. wide was produced, at its lower part breaking a portion of the lOtli rib and injm'ing the lung. The size of the shell-fragment was not known, ns its location was not ascertained ; judging, however, from the slight damage done to the rib, it was plain that it was not actually so large as to produce a wound 15 cm. in length, and the dimension of the wound can only be accounted for by the oblique direction of the fragment. Seeing, however, that the wound wns not only long, but had also a width of 5 cm., we feel justified in making the asser- tion that the fragment was not a small one. Moreover, from the pre- sence of a mnrked subcutaneous emphysema the lung was undoubted- ly injured, yet from the fact that no hasmoptysis nor signs of the penetration of a fragment into the lung nor pain in the chest nor signs of plcuritis were present, Ave must infer that the fragment having partly penetrated into the tissues fell out of its own accord, and that the injmy to the lung was caused by some pieces of the broken rib. As the shape of wound orifices differ, the margins are not necessarily irregularly lacerated, but sometimes are clean and sharp as if cut by a keen edge, as in cases 2-1 and 25. This was due either to the frag- ments having keen edges all around, or to the high velocity of the fragments, or to the lack of subcutaneous soft tissues at the part struck, otherAvise to the stretched state of the muscles and fascia at the time struck. The blind Avounds caused by shell-fragments Avere not seldom at- tended with fractures. The 8 cases of the penetrating wounds of the skull mentioned in the 1st example, and one in ISTo. 27 will specially be treated later on. Other examples attended Avith fractures may be seen in Nos. 11, 12, 13, and 15 (wounds of the forearm) and in Nos. 19, 20, 28, and 29. Of these IsTos. 11, 19, 28, 29, and 30 Avere at-

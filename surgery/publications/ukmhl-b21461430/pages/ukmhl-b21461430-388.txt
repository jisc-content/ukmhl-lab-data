In such wounds, a severe shock may be the sufficient cause for instant death, so it is not necessary to attribute the death to harmorrhage. Also in example No. 2 in which instant death did not ensue, it is not certain whether there was a shock at the time or not, as this case occurred on board the Matsushima where numerous persons were either killed or injured at one time, and the surgeons were consequently too busily engaged to spare time for re- _ cording each case minutely. Indeed none of the first symptoms of any cases in that vessel can be clearly assertnined, but the surgeons concerned in the treatment at that time told us afterwards, that there were many cases of violent shocks among the patients suffering from burns and other wounds. The position and size of the wound in No. 2 were nearly the same as those in Nos. 4 and 5, and it is plain that in this case also the abdominal organs must have been hurt ; the dif- ference in the fate met with, may be attributable to the different severi- ty of shock or internal hasmorrhage, though it may also be due to the condition of the injuries of the abdominal organs, in which in spite of severe injury to the internal organs, instant death can mostly be avoided if the shock be slight, Avithout copious internal ha3morrhage at the same time. Such examples are seen elsewhere and will be dealt with further on. The penetrating wounds of the chest by shell-fragments are shown in Nos. 11, 19, 28, 29, and 30. In the No. 11, the shell-frag- ment may not, as has already been pointed out, have penetrated into the thoracic cavity ; but in No. 19, the fact was plainly otherwise, that is, the fragment entered the cavity below the left scapula smash- ing the ribs, and consequently there ensued intense pain in the left

GAXGRENTE. 394 of mortiiication, and accordingly the tliigh was amputated at the lower part, on hoard the Genkai-maru, hut as this patient had sustained, hesides those above stated, various serious injuries over the Avhole body, being struck by the explosion of an enormous shell, he suc- cumbed to the wound a little time after the operation. Whether in this case the popliteal artery was completely or partially rent, or was heavily contused so as to produce emboli, we can not of course judge with certainty, for all the surgeons being killed at the time there was none who could tell about the condition of the ha3morrhao-e, but con- sidering that the bones were greatly comminuted, we may reasonablv conclude that the artery was rent completely. On the contrary, with the first case, haemorrhage was slight at the time of injury, and no harm was recognised in the popliteal artery when operation A^'as per- formed ; the iron-fragment hitting the part from the front, broke the bone Avithout entering into the joint, so owing to the comminution of the loAver part of the femur, the popliteal artery which runs closely to it was probably heavily contused, so that emboli w^is produced by degrees. Also, the front part of the knee being smashed by a cori- tused Avound, collateral circulation AA^as mostly stopped, and for these reasons, probably gangrene sooner set in. There was a case Avhich resembles the present one, but was healed Avithout gangrene, that is jSTo. 271'chnical history, in this case, a large contused Avound was sustained in front of the right knee-joint, part of the patella smashed and the joint opened, but as the loAver end of the femur received no injury, the artery seemed to have escaped harm. Next, case No. 224 clinical history, received a contused lacerated wound ;tttended Avith fractm'e below the left elboAV joint, thus tearing the bil'urcation of the brachial artery, the patient also sustained a blind wound on the upper ai-m of the same side.

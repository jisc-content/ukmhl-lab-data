412 ENTERIC PEVEE. this disease exists in almost every country, and the proportion between the number of cases and the population may naturally differ according to various causes. However, according to a report furnished by Zuelzer of the number of cases that occurred in 5 years among 10,000 people of all classes in Berlin, the rate per cent was 0.446, which is equal to that of our force at home. Therefore, we may safely assert that the cases of this disease in our navy was not at all increased on account of the war. The following table showincr the rates of cases that occurred in our Navy during 14 consecutive years will prove that the foregoing statement is correct. ENTEEIC FEVEK Year. Gxses.

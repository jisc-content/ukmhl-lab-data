312 BLIXD AXD PENETRATING WOUNDS. If the 57 cases of blind and penetrating Avounds produced hy shell-fragments be proportioned to 289 cases, the total number of various wounds caused by the same missiles, the percentage will be 19.72. This ratio is smaller than 33.56 per cent of contused wounds, but is larger than 6.57 per cent of contusions, 16.26 per cent of abrased wounds, 11.-42 per cent of perforated wounds, or 9.3-1 per cent of mutilated wounds, etc. Thus this class of wound occupies the second place amongst the various wounds caused by shell fragments. This is for the reason that the shell-fra2:ments, thouo-h not increased in psnetrating power by their irregular shape, ^^et have as a rule, a stronger force than iron or wooden pieces, and accordingly not only penetrate the soft tissues, but frequently destroy both hard and soft tissues, except when the fragments ai'e either not very large or they have struck the skin Avith a flat surface. Compared with iron and wooden pieces, shell fragments are by far the more numerous causes of various wounds, so naturally every kind of Avound is produced more by shell-fragments than by any other projectiles. This is especiall}^ the case with the blind and the penetrating Avounds, for of these wounds 72.15 per cent Avere caused by shell-fragments, Avhile other metallic pieces bore a ratio of 15.19 per cent, and Avooden splinters 6.33 per cent ; so it Avill be seen that in this class of Avounds shell-frag- ments proA^ed to be by far the greatest cause of Avounds. The orifices of the blind and penetrating wounds in the skin have various shapes, just as there are sundry shapes and sizes of shell-frag- ments ; but considered in general, the wounds under this category usually liaA^e a lacerated form, attended Avith more or less loss of sub- stance, the margins being irregularly lacerated and the tissues around sustaining contusion. The lacerated appearance is caused as follows:—■ wlien the shell-fragment, Avliich is not originally so great in velocity.

494 VENEREAL DISEASES. then on service in those waters, we find as follows : — Month. 10 a.m. 4 p.m. 10 p.m. Average. June 82° F. 87° F. 84° F. 84° F.

Also, drinking of water to cure thirst pro- duced by intense heat must be regarded as another cause. Besides, Ave had a new cause in the hod procurable, for while on the expedition, the ships' members could not have the same fresh articles as they had at home, but were compelled to take such food as biscuits and tinned meats, which unquestionably proved injurious to the stomach and intestines, and consequently were a cause of the disease under ques- tion. 77 cases of gastric catarrh and 32 coses of indigestion seem to have been produced by one and the same cause. 7.-VENEREAL DISEASES.

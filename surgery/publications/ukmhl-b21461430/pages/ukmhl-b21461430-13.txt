PEEFACE. We consider it our duty to the Medical Profession to publish the accompanying record of casualties and sanitary conditions in the war between China and Japan (July 1894â€”November 1895). Much has been written about the wounds received in wars on land, indeed the Medical and Surgical History of the American Civil War is full of interest and information. Of naval warfare we possess no medical his- tory : the lessons of Trafalgar and Lissa, and war between Chile and Peru have been lost to us, and there has been no previous experience of the treatment of the wounded on ships since the modern revolution in naval warfare. Our ships were, as a rule, considerably injured in the battle of the Yellow Sea, 17 Sept. 1894, and our surgeons during and after that battle were so busily occupied with the treatment of the wounded that they found little time for keeping accurate clinical records. However, in June 1895, a circular was issued by the iSTaval Depart- ment to the Surgeons in charge of Ships, Naval Barracks, and Hos- pitals asking for detailed replies to a carefully elaborated set of questions as to wounds, diseases and general sanitary conditions during the war. In addition to the replies thus obtained from our Surgeons we have used the following documents in the compilation of this book : Sick Lists. Daily Sick-Reports. Clinical Records. Monthly Sick-Reports. Monthly Reports of Force. Q";fterly Reports of Clinical Billets of Wounded. Certificates of Wounded. Certificates of Death. Periodical Reports of Observa- Reports on the Effects of tions made by our Surgeons. Shells received Occasional Reports of Observa- tions made by our Surgeons. August, 1901.

495 VENEREAL DISEASES. a regretable f;ict, but it is the case, not only with our men, but equal- ly with those of every navy, the medical reports of each navy showing that venereal diseases stand in by far the highest ratio. In our country, brothels are licensed, and medical examination is strictly carried out everywhere twice a week under the police regulations, and women who are recognised to be suffering from the disease are placed in lock hospitals, where they are given satisfactory treatment, so that almost nothing is left undone in this line, but unfortunately wherever this system of licensed brothels exists, there are found also private brothels. Quite unlike the licensed ones, these private brothels are scattered over the whole city, and their owners are very clever in hiding themselves from the eyes of the police, and even when hunted up, will again begin before long to open their doors. At various naval ports where the police keep especially strict watch against them, they are just like the harassing flies that come and go. They are indeed a great enemy of the public health. With a view to extirpating this evil, the authorities of our navy have from time to time consulted with the surgeons about preventive measures against venereal diseases, yet no evident result has been achieved. During the war, we saw no remarkable increase in the number of patients belonging to this category, but after the war when the force returned in triumph, they took the liberty to indulge in immoral pleasures, perhaps with a view to recuperate themselves for the hardships of the expedition, and were tempted to approach these brothels. The total number of cases of this disease was 2165. The average daily number of the new patients was 4.5, the ratio being 151.82 per 1,000 force. Oat of shame and with a view to avoid being prohibited from going ashore, patients suffering from venereal disease are disposed to keep the matter a secret. In order to prevent this evil, in our navy.

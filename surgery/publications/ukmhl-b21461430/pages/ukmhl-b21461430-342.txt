274 CONTUSION. 6.57 ]3er cent of the total. This comparatively small number of contusions is due to the fact that in naval engagements, fragments coming in from the shells that exploded at a distance are very few, the shells mostly exploding after they ha^-e struck the vessel ; and further, that the fragments generally injure persons at or about wliere the shells burst or exploded, for the fragments are prevented from fly- ing about by strong walls and other obstacles abundant in vessels. Though these fragments may not be so powerful, yet are strong enough to inflict other kinis of Avounds than mere contusions. Thus cases are very rare in which the fragments ah'eady weakened by col- liding against various objects hit human bodies so as to produce only contusions. Moreover, fragments are of irregular shape having acute points and sharp edges, so that when they strike human bodies, they are apt to break the skin and inflict more than mere contusions. (2) The number of contusions produced by the blows of metallic fragments were five, one to each person wounded : 3 being struck by broken pieces- of gun-shield, 1 hy some other iron-fragments and 1 by the broken piece of a brass rail. Eacli was a simple case merely attended by extravasation of Ijlood, and none jjresented any feature Avorthy of special record. It is a matter of course in naval battles that iron or other metallic fragments bi'oken by hostile shells are driven about in all directions ; yet it is likewise certain that ceteris paribus these fragments are far weaker in force than the fragments of the shells themselvesâ€”especi- ally so in the case of an exploded shell. For Avhen a shell strikes metallic substance, the former first loses more or less of its original force according to the degree of resistance offered, and further, it imparts part of the already weakened force to metallic fragments which thus obtain their motion, therefore the metallic indirect shots

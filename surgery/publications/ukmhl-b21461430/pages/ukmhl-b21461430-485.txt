413 EXTEKIC FEVER. It is an unhappy fact expsriencel by every nation, that forces sent on an expedition suffer much from the prevalence of this disease ; which fact we learn from late reports as well as former experiences. But on the contrary, we had in our Xavy, during the war, no more cases than usual. This happy result, we are very glad to say, must really be attributed to the particular attention paid l)y medical and other officers concerned, and to the fact that the men faithfully observed the instructions given them with regard to sanitation. Investigating into the causes of the cases, which we had, it was ascertained that they were mostly of scattered nature ; the paths of infection were uncertain though it was evident that the causes existed outside of the Navy. The seasons at which the disease appeared were chiefly in Summer and Autumn and the persons affected were all young. The ratio of deaths which was 25 to 30 per cent appears to be rather high, but this can not be said to be unreasonably great, for during an expedition the proper treatment of the disease is often hampered by various circumstances. However, when a case broke out, no matter whether it was on board or on land, the place did not fail to undergo a thorough dis- infection ; and not a single case occurred of further infection in the Navy circle itself. Much to our regret, however, at the end of the war, an epidemic of enteric fever broke out on board the Yamato, as this, in reality, occurred after the end of the war, only a part of the cases were included in the number of those already enumerated, but for the sake of explaining theiv course, a report furnished by the surgeon will be stated here. The Yamato is a vessel built at the Yokosuka Ship- building Yard, Japan, in 1885, having a displacement of 1476 tons ; a corvette, iron-frame, clad in wood. She had a complement of 228

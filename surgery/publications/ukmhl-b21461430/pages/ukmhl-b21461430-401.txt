333 PERFOEATED WOUNDS. it is nothing abnormal that they should have all been penetrating wounds. Again, in the clinical history there were several cases stated as blind wounds where the wound was very deep but no record was given of the existence of shell-fragments. In these cases, it could not be ascertained whether the wounds were healed with the fragments remaining, or whether the wounds merely resembled blind ones, but were actually contused or lacerated wounds. As we have already said, there are cases in which the missiles striking a part poor in subcutaneous tissues, penetrated a little distance and stopped there, and then came off of their own accord, but cases of deep wounds with no shell-fragments in them can not be regarded as true blind wounds. 5.-PERF0RATED WOUNDS. (1) There is one case of perforated wounds caused by an entire shell, as is seen in the man killed on the fore-top of the Akagi. According to the report made by the Chief Surgeon of the ship, he was pierced through the abdomen from the loins, the lumbar vertebrae were smashed and the aorta ruptured (case 'No. 171), possibly by a shell from a light-machine gun of some 47 m.m. But another person who was injured at the same place and time (No. 235) seems to have been struck by a fragment of a shell, as was seen from the powder grains sticking in dots around the wound of the hand. This is a point admitting of doubt, for on tlie one hand unless a shell exploded in the neighborhood, such intrusion of powder grains would not have occurred ; but on the other, allowing that such explosion happened, it is strange that the margin of the wound in the hand was the only place covered with powder grains which ought to have been scattered more widely, so as to involve the face and other exposed parts, or to inflict burns there. The only explanation that can be offered is that

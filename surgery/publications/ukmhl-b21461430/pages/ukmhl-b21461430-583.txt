Tinned vegetables were all found good, consisting of dock, carrots, edible mushrooms, bamboo sprouts, beans and turnips. The food preferred by most of the seamen was boiled rice, fresh meat, and fresh vegetables. The fresh vegetables and fruit which kept best and were most relished by the fleet during the war were as follows:â€”potatoes, onions, pumpkins, winter-melons, egg-plants, cabbages, sweet-potatoes, edible roots, dock, cariots, lotus- roots, water-melons, summer oranges and pumelos. Ikef, fowls (alive), and eggs were much used. Live cows and oxen were once conveyed by w^ar-ships and transports, but not only did they require a great quantity of water and hay, but in bad weather they often got sea-sick, became emaciated, and succumbed. In the late war, our Army and Navy being constantly victorious, our communication by transports was very easy, and accordingly fresh food was sent from home from time to time. Even at the time when communication Avas inter- rupted, it was not difficult to obtain food at the front, and the men were never confined to the exclusive use of tinned meats lonirer than a month. So in no case did we find that the health of the ship's company was impaired by the use of tinned food. There Avere naturally a few cases of loss of appetite oAving to the monotony of the food and also a few^ cases of indigestion, especially among those who were already suffering from dyspepsia. This seems to have induced a few cases of kak'ke, for we have reports from some ships to this effect. Also, according to certain reports, numerous eruptions of boils were attributed to the altered state of blood consequent on the lack of fresh food, but Ave think this was more probably due to an unclean state of the skin caused by insufficient Avashing during the hot season.

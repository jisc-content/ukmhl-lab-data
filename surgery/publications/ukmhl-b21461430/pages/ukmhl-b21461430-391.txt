Moreover, shell- fragments mostly strike the body at an oblique angle as will be seen in the foregoing 3 instances. This is surely another cause of obstruct- ing the escape of air out of the chest. It is therefore not strange that emphysema should be of more frequent occurrence in the wounds caused by shell-fragments. Of the afore said 3 instances, one Avas, as has been mentioned, certainly attended with haemoptysis, in another bloody expectorations began a few days after the injury. In the re- maining case, we have no record of hiemoptysis, and can affirm that it did not actually occur, for so important a symptom could not have been left unrecorded if it had existed. Thus, in each of the 3 cases, the lung injury was certainly slight and superficial, and we thus infer that subcutaneous emphysema is more likely to ensue in slight injuries of the lungs. Xos. 28 and 29 were cases in which th(ju"h the shell frao^ment entered through the thoracic walls, it finally reached the abdominal cavity : in No. 28, the fragment entering the 9th intercostal space broke the 10th rib, then injuring the liver, arrived beneath the skin on the right side of the first tAvo lumbar vertebra?. There existed no signs indicating lung injury, but it Avas beyond doubt that the liver Avas wounded, for from the Avound orifice escaped a fluid mixed with bile pigments, and from time to time pieces of hepatic substance were discharged ; further, on probi ng the AVtjund orifice it was found to communicate with the liA^er. However, severe paroxysmal pain in the right shoulder, Avhich often attends hepatic injury did not occur, nor AA^as there any jaundice or hiccough. The Avound v)rifice at first seemed inclined to suppurate, but afterAvards it made \ ery fxvorable progress and Avas at last healed.

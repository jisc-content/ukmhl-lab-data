LACERATED AND BlUTlLATEU WOUNDS. 365 contused woands of the riglit index and ring fingers, and an abrased Avound of the left leg. This person eventually recovered ; but having lost the right middle finger, and the action of the index and ring fingers not being completely restored, he Avas dismissed after 459 days of treat- ment; (22) received a grooved wound on the right forenrm which was healed in 37 days; (23) an abrased wound of the scalp Avhich was cured in 3 days ; (24) a contused wound on the right thumb from a wooden splinter and recove.red in 2 Aveeks; (25) a contused Avound of the right thuml) Avhich Avas healed in 32 days. Thus 4 out of the 8 persons, Avho happened to be very near the explosion and Avere most exposed to the shell-fragments, received mutilated Avounds, or heavy lacerated Avounds, Avhich killed 3 of them; and 1, thinigh not killed had to be dismissed after long treatment. The remaining 4 persons happened to be some little distance from the room Avhere the explo- sion occurred, or to be on the starboard side of the ship, and Avere thus only slightly injured. No one in this 4th quarter received either burns or rupture of the membrana tympani, several persons indeed escaped injury altogether. In the 3rd quarter, only those persons Avho hap})ened then to be at the entrance to the 4th quarter Avere injured, none of them being killed or succumbing to their Avounds. 'I'hus, (26) received blind wounds oi: the right arm and forearm attended Avith fracture, which healed completely after a treatment of 170 days; (27) a slight contu- sion on the right side of the chest which Avas cured in 3 days ; (28) a contused Avound on the right temple Avliich was healed in 23 days. Of these 3 persons, (26) sustained severer Avounds than did (27) and (28) in the 4th quarter. This Avas probably because the shell-fragments came flying direct, and their poAver had not been inq)aired. This Avas perhaps a matter of chance.

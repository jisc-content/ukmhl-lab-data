KAK'KE. 475 action became quick. Cold and sinapisms were applied to the chest and a purgative enema was used but these measures proved in- effectual, and his strength was gradually waning. Hereupon, sub- cutaneous injection of camphor and ether was resorted to by which the heart action was indeed restored for a while, but its activity again collapsed, and the patient at last expired at 5.35 on the 30th following. Two cases of the subacute kak'ke ^n'e givenbelow as typical examples: K. Deguchi aged 29 years 9 months, seaman of the despatch-boat Akiishi-maru, about September 22nd 1894 noticed a swelling in the lower linxbs but not so much as to trouble him greatly, but on the 25th following, .the swelling greatly increased attended by numbness which caused difficulty of walking, when he applied for medical help, he had tolerably good nutrition of the body, the tongue was covered with yellowish-white fur, appetite lacking, the bowels costive, the pulse full and strong 84 in the minute ; the temperature was normal, the spirit was somewhat depressed, and a slight headache. The legs were swollen, so that marks were left on pressure. Besides, the calves of the leg were remarkably tense, with frequent spasm, and the numbness existed along the inner side of each leg, extending down to the dorsum of feet. The patellar reflex was lost. The urine was of amber colour presenting acid reaction, but without any abnormal ingredients. Palpitation was complained of, though physical examination detected no change in the position of the heart, nor in its sounds. The case was diagnosed as subacute kak'ke, and a mixture of tincture of rhubarb, and cream of tartar was given accompanied by a dose of sulphate of magnesia as a purgative. This afforded a free motion, consequently appetite returned. By October 9th, the spasm of the calves was relieved, and the swellino^ and numbness of both leg's abated. The patient completely recovered on the 22nd of October the same year.

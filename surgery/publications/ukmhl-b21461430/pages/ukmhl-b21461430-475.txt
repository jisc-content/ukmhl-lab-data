TREATMENT OF THE WOUNDED. 403 taken, such as to wash the insides of the wounds, to disinfect the sur- rounding skin, to extract foreign bodies when they could be easily seen and removed, to staunch h;emorrhage, by compression or torsion, -and in case of a fracture to apply splints. This is inevitable during battle, when little individual care can be given to the patients : Avhen the battle was over, proper treatment was accorded in the order of tlie urgency of the respective wounds. At the time of the second treat- ment, the wounds were again disinfected within and around, any foreign body that was recognised by exploration was removed, splints that were found not to have been properly applied were renewed, and so forth. The battle of the Yellow sea, was not however, finished before night fall : the darkness combined with the utter exhaustion of the crews, made the subsequent treatment extremely difficult. The principal antiseptics used in ships for irrigation of wounds and other ^similar purposes, was a solution of carbolic acid, 2.5—3 per cent, sometimes supplemented by a sprinkling of iodoform. To wounds in the eyes, chest and abdomen, a sohitinn of boracic acid was chiefly used. For dressing materials, corrosive sublimate gauze, carbolic acid gauze or absorbent cotton wool were em- ployed, with linseed oil paper and bandage applied over them. The splints used vrere all made of wood. For gypsum bandage, which is very inconvenient for use on ships during action, wooden splints proved an efficacious substitute. As notwithstanding the great at- tention paid on each ship to the washing of wounds with antiseptic .solution, the process was, as was said in the last chapter, not enough to prevent the wounds from suppuration, it is plain that stronger mea- ■sures should be taken ^vith shell-wounds. It is true that shell-wounds are extremely disposed to suppuration, that the conditions on board .ships during action Avere likely to soil wounds ; and besides, the

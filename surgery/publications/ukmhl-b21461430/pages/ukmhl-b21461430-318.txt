The injuries of the head, neck, chest, back, loins, and abdomen, were apt to be so serious as to cause instant death or death soon after injury, while those which healed were only superficial wounds and therefore the number of invalidings was small or none at all. On the other hand, in the injuries of the face and of tlie upper and lower limbs, the rate of deaths is comparatively small, and even serious wounds did not prove fatal owing to the recent progress in the surgical art, hence the greater number of invalid- ings from the resulting impairment of the functions of the injured parts. Cases of infections of the wounds were very few and only one unfortunately ended in erysipelas. The percentage of ' Deaths before admission,' ' Deaths after admis sion,' ' Recoveries,' and ' Invalidings,' exclusive of those instantly killed is as follows : — Deaths before admission ... 11.54; Deaths after admission 4.38 Recoveries 70.67 Invalided 13.46 These rates will be again taken up after we have finished our consideration of the attack on Wei-hai-wei.

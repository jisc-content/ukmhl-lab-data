BLIND AND PENETRATING WOUNDS. 327 capable of being stretched by pressure, owing to the free movement of the tissues which had been freed from connection Ijelow, and besides, the relaxation of the muscles produced by the very severe shock which inevitably follows a mutilated wound, may also have had something to do with this phenomenon. 'Jlie several reasons above mentioned, will perhaps account for so great a ditFerence between the size of the wound orifice and of the iron-piece. The 5th example which bore a resemblance to the last case, was one in which both legs were mutilated by a shell, and in the right thigh were concealed 3 large pieces of the funnel casing as are shown in the illustration in the clinical history. The orifice of this wound was also smaller than that of the iron-pieces ; however, its exact length was not known, for the difference not being so marked as in the 4th example, thed imension of the wound was not measured. This and the last wounds were inflicted by the same cause, but as tlie weight of the iron-piece was much smaller than in the 4th example, it naturally stretched the skin in a lesser degree. Besides, in tliis case, though the mutilated wound was in the leg, the resistance of the subcutaneous tissues was not so much lessened as in the last example, and thus the difference between the sizes of the orifice and of the iron-piece was not so great as in the 4tli example. The division of the piece of iron into tliree must have taken place after the iron entered the wound. Besides, there were one or two blind W(3unds produced in parts rich in soft tissues, but with them, the difference between the size of the wound orifice, and that of the iron-piece was not so marked, f)r as the fragmerits entered the tissues in a slanting direction their sizes were almost the same.

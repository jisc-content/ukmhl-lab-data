H^MOKRHAGE. 378 Haemorrhage was so slight that it liail stoppeil when tlie wonnd- ed men were brouglit to tlie surgery, and there only a slight hfeniorrhage took place when the wonnds were explored : Surgeon K. Asano. Hemorrhage was not heavy : Snrgeon Y. Fujii. On the Hiyei, I examined a case in which IG honrs had elaps- ed since the injury. The haemorrhage was wouderfnlly slight—so slight that it hardly deserved the name. In some cases attended witli fracture, the lijemorrhage was hea%'y owing to bleeding from the marrow. I can say nothing about the more serious cases, as I did not see them until death had taken place : Surgeon K. Yoshimnra. Tliere were many cases in Avhich h;T?morrhage took place at tlie moment of injury, but ceased almost immediately : Surgeon K. Tawara. Hjemorrhage was very slight, probably owing to blood coagula- tion consequent on the laceration of vessels. For instance, when amputation was performed in the case where the wrist was mutilated, and the hand hnng on to the wrist by a single piece of skin on the ulnar side (No. 261), a cojgulated column of blood was extracted from the radial as well as the ulnar artery which measured several inches long : Surgeon K. Asai. Haemorrhage was, as a rule, recognised to be slight: Surgeon T. Kagami. Thus, the observutious of all the surgeons coincide in showing" that htemorrhage was sUght. These observations are of course of a general nature and do not hold good for all cases, for as is seen in the clinical histories of the second chapter, there are some cases recorded which Avere attended with heavy hasmorrhage. T'his depends greatly on the injury to the blood vessels ;—when they are rent asunder, coagulation is rapid, as ali'eady shown, and accordingly haemorrhage is slight; but when they are only perforated or half rent, the middle and inner coats of the vessels being hindered from curling up, coagulation does not

KAK'KE. 470 of diet, and no other hygienic improvement has been recognised as having had anything to do with this result. (3) Instances of kak'ke prevalence in our country that hnve been greatly reduced or totally extirpated by the improvement of diet are to be found not only in our Navy, but in Army barracks and prisons all over the Empire. (4) It is an indisputable fact that kak'ke is most frequent in warm or hot seasons. This we believe is because, owing to the inert- ness of the appetite in those season?;, the Japanese are xery apt to take nothing but plain meals as " chazuke-meshi." If such food be used too often or exclusively, the disease will break out in the coldest season just as much as in the hottest. (5) It is evident that kak'ke is liable to prevail in crowded places such as barracks, factories, and prisons. Persons in these places sret their food served to them resrardless of their own choice of dishes, with a consequent increase in the quantity of rice. They are thus very liable to the disease. Such persons will enjoy immunity from kak'ke, no matter how low and damp their places of abode may be, if only they are able to make free choice of food. (6) If we make investigations about instances of kak'ke pre- valence in districts that have not hitherto been visited by it, it will surely be found that the disease has been taken abroad by people who take rice in large quantities. (7) The increased prevalence of kak'ke in Japan within the last 20 or 30 years, is to be attributed to an increased supply of rice in all districts, and also the increase of persons boarding in other people's houses. The prevalence of the same disease in Brazil, is, we believe, to be accounted for on the same grounds. (8) The circumstances attending all tlie prevalences that have come underour knowledge, show that kak'ke can not regarded as an infectious disease.

CAUSES OF WOUNDS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION. 269 Fragments either of iron or A\'ood 2 cases. Compression between two objects 1 case. Fall 1 case. Collision 1 case. Husks of buck-Avheat 1 case. Sum total 8()G cases. The above enumeration is reckoned by counting one chief wound out of the many smaller ones that each person generally received, for we find that the majority had several Avounds from ditferent causes. Therefore, in order to ascertain the relation between each cause, and the variety of wounds, as well as their number, we have to make a classification, by treating each Avound as an independent one, table No. 2 is the classification of causes and Avounds, based on the number of Avounds but not on that of persons. From table ISTo. 2, we see that the total number of various wounds was 629, that by far the larger part of them Avas caused by the fragments of shells ; for the wounds of this class amount to 45.95 per cent of the total ; the second cause Avas ignition of gun-poAvder produced by the explosion of shells, of Avhich the rate of Avounds is 12.56 per cent; the third A\^as the metallic indirect shots caused by the explosion of shells, of Aviiich the rate of Avounds is 9.54 per cent; the fourth Avas the explosion of shells in which the gas and flame from the explosive, and iron or Avooden splinters as Avell as the shell fragments A\-ere the conjoint cause, of which tlie rate of Avounds is 9.38 per cent; the fifth Avas pieces of Avood smashed off by shells of which the rate of Avounds is 9.22 per cent; the sixth Avas the shock of shell explosion by Avhich men Avere either knocked down or blown aAvay of Avhich the rate of Avounds is 3.02 per cent; the seventh Avas the shock of firing and vibration of gas of Avliich tlie rate of Avounds is 2.23 per

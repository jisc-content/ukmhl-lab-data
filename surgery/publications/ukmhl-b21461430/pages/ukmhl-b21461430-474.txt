Conveyance by hands alone, is prompt and convenient, even if there be many wounded persons at one time ; for every man that is uninjured can generally be useful for carrying Avounded men ; and so during the actual battle, our men were oblig- ed to resort to this method. But even then a seriously wounded person, requires the assistance of 3 or -1 men, to get him up or down stairs, and there is always a great deal of confusion in the removal ; also, in the conveyance of patients who have sustained fracture or extensive burns, this method certainly aggravates the injury ; and, from this point of view, carrying on stretchers is by far the better. We have still a great deal to learn about the conveyance of the wounded on ships, but it is a sine qua non that some handy way like the bare hand method must be resorted to, at the time of actual engagement, and therefore ships' crews should be also drilled in this jnethod of conveyance. After the battle, in transferring the wounded from one ship to another, and similar cases, the bare-hand method is not needed ; for the wounds have by this time been properly treated : splints and band- ages have been applied; and there is time enough to lay the patients â€¢comfortably upon stretchers.

In regard to the treatment of the wounded, we have already stated, that at first only urgent and temporary measures of relief were

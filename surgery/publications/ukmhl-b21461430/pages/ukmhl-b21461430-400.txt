BLIXD AND PKN'E I RA riXG WOUNDS. 332 ous Avouiifls, they bear a, ratio of 1:2.56 per cent, which iudeed is by far smaller than the ratio of contused wounds, but occupies the high- est lumiber among- all other kinds of Avounds. This is the point which shoAvs the difference between the nature of shell wounds and bullet wounds. The bullets on account of their velocity and shape were suited for penetration, thus they generally produced perforating wounds, while shell-fragments as well as ir.on or wooden pieces have an irregular shape and are not forcible enough to pierce through an object, and therefore those whicli are heavy, and accordingly possess much force produce mutilated wounds, those AA'hich rank next in bulk, and are not so forcible in power cause mostly contused wounds or contusions, and those which are small in bulk, and more or less strong in velocity, or those which are pointed at the end, and are suited for piercing, can only enter int<:> tissues, yet oAving to insufficiency of force and unfaA^orable shape, mostly stop when they meet with tissues offering much resistance ; hence the result is a blind or penetrating wound. Therefore, such wounds as perforating ones are of very rare occurrence. However, the contused, blind and perforating Avounds do not depend for their production only on the velocity, size, and shape of the projectiles, but also on the conditions of the part struck. In parts rich iii soft tissues, as the thigh, and parts covering soft internal organs, as the abdominal walls, which are easily penetrated, even those mis- siles which produce contused Avounds elscAvhere may often cause blind or perietrating Avounds. That there were nine cases of penetrating Avounds in hard parts like the head, may appear at first sight incompa- tible Avith the above statement; however, not only can these 9 cases not be certainly described as penetrating Avounds, but they Avere all inflicted in the proximity of shell-explosions so the fragments, CA^en tliough small, may be regarded as not haAnng been AA'eak in force, and

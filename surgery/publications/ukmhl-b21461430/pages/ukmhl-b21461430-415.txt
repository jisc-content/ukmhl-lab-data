PERFORATED WOUNDS. 347 wound, the injured man escaped instant death, without exhibiting any symptoms of shock, are to be h:)oked upon as amomalous. This certainly depended on the circumstances of the visceral lesion, the direction of the shell-fragment; and also on the constitution of the injured man. Thus, it is hardly necessary to say tliat the result is not always the same in all cases. The only case of perforating wound of the head is the 20th instance, in which instant death was quite natural. The wounds of the head by shell-fragments, mostly take tlie form of mutilated wounds hy the destruction of a part of the skull, or else of contused lacerated wounds attended Avith fracture, or of penetrating Avounds ; and it is very rare that a perforating wound is produced like in the present case. This was because the sliape of the shell-fragment was not adapted for perforation. The 7th instance was a perforating wound of the neck resulting in death an hour after the injury. In this case, it is recorded that the carotid artery was not hurt, but neither the size of the wound nor the injury of the cervical vertebra3 was recorded, hence we cannot affirm any- thing exactly, yet the rise of temperature after injury is very curious. It may have been due to a lesion in the upper part of the spinal cord. The 10th example was a case in which after the cure of a perfora- ting wound with fracture in the right arm, an incurable paralysis of the musculo-spiral nerve was left. From the position of the wound which perforated the middle of the upper arm from back to front, it is probable that the nerve was injured at the same moment with the humerus, but perhaps, as the arm was kept with a splint, symptoms of nerve injury did not appear until some time after. We shall discuss this case more fully hereafter. (3) There were three perforating wounds caused by iron-pieces occurring in 3 persons, as follows:

H.BMORRHA<jE. 377 HiemoiTliage heuvy wlieii au incised wound was inflicted Ijy a powei-ful sbell-frasraent, but slight when a lacerated wound or such lilce was caused by a weak shell-fragment: Staff Surgeon K. lid. Hsemorrhage was recognised to be particulary slight in a lacerated wound caused by the fragment of a funnel, and when the patient was brought to the surgery, it was found to have almost ceased. Also small in every otljer wound : Surgeon T. Nakao. Though I had no opportunity of observing a case attended with injury of a large vessel, hfBmorrhage from the wounds was comparatively very little, just as in other lacerated wounds produced by the pressure of some blunt body : Fleet Surgeon S. Kimura. Hfemorrhage was not heavy in shell-wounds as compared with other injiu'ies, for in the former the tissues are either destroyed, lacerated or mutilated : Staff' Surgeon B. Tomatsuri. With the mutilated wounds of both thighs and both legs, hfemorrhage was found to be very copious, but in other kinds of wounds comparatively slight: Satff'Surgeon T. Murakami. Comparatively small in (piantity : Surgeon S. Negoro. I observed a case in which the lower jaw was smashed and the facial artery was rent, almost without the loss of a drop of blood : Surgeon K. Toyama. I did not notice any case of spouting hajmorrhage; the bleeding mostly stopped of its own accord, and what hiiemorrhage there was, of an oozing nature as the dressings were found Avet a few hours afterwards : Surgeon K. Usui. I observed a case of inutilated shell-wound at the lower part of the forearm attended with burns, and another case of lacerated wound of the forearm, attended with fracture of the ulna and injury of the artery, and found hii?morrhage vei'y slight in the former case and heavy i!i the latter : Surgeon N.

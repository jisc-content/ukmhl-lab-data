NERVOUS SYMPTOMS. 385 I saw no concussion occnrring from the wounds of sliell-fnig- ment, but saw it in a patient who sustained a contused wound by a wooden splinter : Surgeon K. Tawara. We see therefore that concussion and its degree nut only depends on the character and position of the wound, but also on the constitu- tion of each individual and his condition at the time of injury ; wliich accounts for the surgeons on the various ships not agreeing iri their observations. With regard to the characters of Avounds, those produc- ed in the naval battles would naturally be more sidjject to concussion than those occurring elsewhere. Especially, Avounds on the head, chest, and abdomen are susceptible to shock, and even those of the limbs when the woimds are of a mutilated kind. However, this does iK^t always h(jld good, because the condition of the wounded person at the time of injury has nuicli to do with it. It has long been proved that the mind of combatants beino- excited at the time of fio'litino- there are cases in which in spite of fatal wounds, concussion does not occur. In our late Avar also, there were not a few persons who received large perforating woujids of the abdomen, or mutilated Avounds of the limbs; but they did not shoAV any signs of sh(3ck until death supervened. ]jut those persons Avho Avere in the neighbourhood of the explo- sion of shell, no matter the causative objects or tlie size of the Avound, Avere often attended by concussion, as the body received suck a shock as to paralyze the nervous system. This accounts for many more instances of concussion observed by the surgeons on board the Matsushima and Hiyei. Besides, in the Matsushima numerous cases of extensiA^e burns occurred Avhicli as is Avell knoAvn occasions serious shock. In addition to this in the various ships many fainted at tlie time of injury, as is shown by Nos. 132, 138, 139, 203, 211. 291, 324, etc., in the clinical history, A\diich Avere all less serious cases.

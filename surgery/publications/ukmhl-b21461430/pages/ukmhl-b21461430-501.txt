429 CHOLERA. (2) CHOLERA. Japan is unfortunately often ravaged by epidemic cholera. 189-1 was luckily a very healthy year, the cases of sporadic cholera through- out the country during the year being only 546. On the other hand in May of the next year when our troops were returning home from China, reports to the effect that the troops and coolies on the expedition had been attacked by cholera reached the central govern- ment, and caused the utmost consternation. As soon as this report was received the Home and the War departments set to work with zeal, omitting no measure for quarantine and prevention. The virus however, notwithstanding all efforts was disseminated throughout the land : the number of cases amounting to 55,144, of which 40, 154 resulted in death. In the army, the total number of patients was 9,658, of whom, 2,365 recovered, and 5,991 died, while the remaining 1,300 odd cases having been, for some reason or other, transferred to other departments not be ascertained with accuracy. In our navy, there occurred during the war 89 cases, of which 49 were abroad and 40 at home stations. Iksides these, there were 55 cases among the employes and mostly among the men engaged with the transports in the service of the naval station at Port Arthur. During the service abroad, the Omi produced the largest number of patients, that is, 13 cases ; the Kaimon 7, the Matsushima 6, the Sai-yen, Banjo, and Kongo each 3, and there were several other ships atid torpedo-boats which had only 1 case each. The Places at home which were infected with the disease were mostly on land that is, 10 patients each at the Yokosuka naval barracks and the Sasebo defence mine station, 9 at the Ivure naval barracks, 4 at the Sasebo naval barracks. Besides the above, there were several places each of which produced only a single case.

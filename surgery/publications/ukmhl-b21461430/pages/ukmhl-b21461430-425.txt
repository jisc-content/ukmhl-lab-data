LACE?;-ATED AND MUTILATED WOUNDS. 357 the limbs, because the effect to the system by such injury is so terrible; indeed, hasmorrhage was, as a rule, not so heavy, but the shock was found to be remarkable. The lacerated surface was in every case found ruo'cjed with soft tissues hang'ina- like rao-s of uneven leijo;th, and usually with irregularly broken ends of bone. The condition of the lacerated wounds produced by such a forcible object as a shell, and that caused by a heavy object like a large iron-piece may be expected to differ from each other. However, owing to the absence of concomit- ant observation of these wounds in one person, we are not in a position, from the respective reports concerning them to make any distinction. Among the lacerated wounds of the head caused by shell-fragments, there were many cases in which though the scalp was rent (without any remarkable loss to its substance), and only a part of the upper half of the skull broken, yet the brain substance was so cleanly swept away that no trace of it was left except the remnant of the torn membrane. This was perhaps because such a soft and comparatively mobile organ as the brain was smashed and scattered by the momen- tum imparted to it by the flying shell-fragments, and this may sup- port the hydraulic theory held by some surgeons. Accordingly, even with a shell-fragment that is only large enough to produce a perforat- ing wound in other parts may sometimes prove exceedingly destructive when it strikes the head. (B) Mutilated wounds make a total of thirty cases, of which 27 w^ere those of the whole body, two of the lower half of the body, and one of the extremities; and 27 cases of them occurred in the Matsushima, two in the Hiyei, and 1 in the Akitsushima. Among the 27 cases of the Matsushima, 26 were caused by the explosion of a single shell. The rest also were caused by shell-explosion. In the Matsushima, a 30.5 cm. shell exploded striking the shield of the jN'o. 4 side-gun, in

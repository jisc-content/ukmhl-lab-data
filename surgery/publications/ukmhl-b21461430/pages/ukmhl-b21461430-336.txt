CHAPTER IV. CAUSES OF WOUNDS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION. In naval battles, the main cause of wounds is certainly shells, but their effects differ greatly according to the manner in which they either do, or do not " explode," or "burst." Besides, the shells them- selves, iron and wooden splinters of other things caused by the bursting of shells, act as so called indirect shells. Therefore, materials that may become the causes of wounds are numerous. Table No. 1 shows the classification of different causes of wounds in each ship engaged in the various battles. Besides the cases counted on table No. 1, there were five more deaths due to either drowning, or extreme cold, but causes which produced the injui-ies will, with these five exceptioris, be recapitulated below from the largest number downward. Fragments of the shells 14<) cases. Explosion of gun powder 49 cases. Wooden splinters 36 cases. Indirect shots 35 cases. Fragments of iron 34 cases. Shock of firing and vibration of gas . 16 cases.

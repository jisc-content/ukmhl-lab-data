THE BATTLE OF YALtT. 46 room. One of them, breaking a starboard ventilator, exploded in front of the wardroom, smashing it as well as several other adjoining rooms, with the sky-light, hatch, and all the furniture ; the other split the steam-pipe and water-pipe connected with the steering gear, and pass- ing just under the upper deck, pierced the deck, went through a cutter, and at last fell overboard. At the time, Chief Surgeon K. Tawara, who was at the entrance of the hatch to the wardroom, was thrown down on the stairs by the shock of the explosion and wounded. Also a captain's servant and a stoker, who were then at the same place, and two oil men, who were at the hatchway of the engine room, were slightly injured by wooden splinters. 3. —About 2.24 p.m., two shells, one of 12 cm. and the other of 21 cm. at the same time reached to the wardroom on the upper deck, from the starboard side, but passed away without exploding or pro- ducing any special damage. 4. —About 2.30 p.m., a 15 cm. shell struck against the last boat- davit on the starboard c[uarter splitting it in two, and exploded there, shell fragments, broken iron pieces, wooden splinters flying in every direction over the uppermost deck. A quarter-master and two men of the 57 m.m. q.f.-gun, were injured. 5. —2.30 p.m., two 12 cm. shells came from the starboard side and pierced the funnel. 6. —About 2.36 p.m., a 15 cm. shell struck the ship at the water- line on the starboard side of the after part, but it had not sufficient force to penetrate through the side, only leaving a crack which let in a little water. 7. —About 2.40 p.m., a 12 cm. shell, rushing in by the stern, exploded against a stanchion in the after part of the main deck. This terribly damaged the adjoining rooms, and set them on fire. It was however soon extinguished.

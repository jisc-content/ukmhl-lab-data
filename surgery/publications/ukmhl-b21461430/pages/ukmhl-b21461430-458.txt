XEEVOUS SYMPTOMS. 386 This depends greatly on tlie character and position of the wound, and the coi^dition of the wounded person at the time of disaster. Now in the late war, concussion was recognised to be comparatively frequent in the contused wound or contusion of the chest ; especially in the Wounds caused by the blow of an object unf ivourable for penetration such as a wooden splinter ; and also in the wounds produced at the same time with the shock of explosion. It is true that this depends on the constitution of each individual, but it has not necessarily any relation with his timidity or courage as is widely knoAvn. (2) Traumatic delirium. In the Matsushima and Hiyei, tliis symptom was seen among those who were wounded in the neibour- hood of the places where enormous shells had exploded, but in no other case. In Matsushima these were all cases of burns, of Avhom 2 or 3 died before they were admitted to the hospital, and 2 died in the hospital, lach was burned extensively over the body.

Unable to sleep well at night for pains, they lay groaning, crying, or singing aloud, but as the mind remained clear, it could not be said that tliey were delirious.

The one died -i days after injury, and the other 15 days.

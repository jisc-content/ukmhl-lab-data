From the presence of severe pain in the hypochondriac region and subcutaneous emphysema, we may infer that the shell-fragment dropped into the pleural cavity after breaking the ribs ; it is plain that the lung was injured, liowever from the absence of haemoptysis at the time of injury it can not be thought that the fragment injured the lung deep doAvn. Probably the lung was either superficially hurt by some broken pieces of the ribs, or by a shell- fragment which did enter deep into the organ. The bloody ex- pectorations which appeared a few days after and lasted pretty long, were probably consequent on the circumscribed pneumonia ensuing around the wound, and the disappearance of the pleurodynia was probably due to the fact that the shell-fragment was encysted in infliimmatory products. Tn example No. 30, which occurred on the Matsushima, the ribs were certainly broken, and it was likewise evident from the existence of subcutaneous emphysema and pneumo- thorax that the lung was injured, but in the absence of any detailed record of symptoms, it is very uncertain whether the shell-fragment penetrated into the lung or not. The death of the patient on the following day, was because of the combined etfects of extensive ljurns received at the same time. The instances in which subcutaneous emphysema resulted Avere three, that is, IsTos. 11, 19 and 30 ; and further, in the two examples 28 and 29, the 10th rib was broken. Yet as will be hereafter shown, the lung was injured only in one case. There Avas aloo a penetrating wound of the thoracic avmJI breaking the 5th and Gth i.bs on the left side, in Avhich it could not be ascertained Avhether the cause Avas a shell-fragment or an iron-piece. In this case, also the lung seemed

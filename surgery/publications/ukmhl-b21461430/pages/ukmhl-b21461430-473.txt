401 SUEGEEY IN THE SHIP. The Tsuknba—Fore part on the lower deck ; and tlie ward-room. The Yayeyama—Ward-room m the aft on the lower deck. The Saikyo-maru—Fore part on the main deck. As above stated, places appropriated by the respective ships were not the same, and some parts although dirty and narrow and quite unfit for surgery, were made use of, as there were no better places. This was an unavoidable outcome from the construction of certain ships, but considered from a surgical point of view, it must be regard- ed as a gross defect. In ships with three surgeons a question may arise, how they should be allotted to two surgeries, whether the larger number be advantageously i"laced in the fore part or in the aft. This must be determined according to the size of the respective surgeries, and their convenience for the collection of the wounded. However, as is plain from the 6th and lotli tables in chapter iii, the comparative numbers of the wounded in the fore and the aft are any- thing but certain, as might be expected. That the total number of the wounded in the fore part was by far larger than that of the aft, was because a large number happened to be wounded in the fore part of the Matsushima. 2.-C0NVEYANCE OF THE WOUNDED. Apparatus for the conveyance of the wounded can no more be uniform in size and construction than ships can. Various kinds had been provided for use on board, one like an easy-chair, net hammock^ Macclonald's or Gihon's stretchers, etc., and the men had been drilled beforehand in their u«e. But during the actual engagement, it was found that stretchers of all kinds were cumbrous and troublesome, and of very little use for the speedy conveyance of a large liumber of

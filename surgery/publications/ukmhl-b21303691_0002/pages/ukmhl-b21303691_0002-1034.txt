992 DISLOGATIONS. displacement—i.e. in dorsal flexion—and as the surfaces disengage, it should be bz’ought towards the palm, still keeping up extension. By adduction of the metacarpal bone, and traction in dorsal flexion the opening between the heads of the short flexor and in the apo- neurotic structures gapes, and on extending, the metacarpal bone slips backwards and the base of the phalanx forwards, thus eflecting reduction. The common error made in this manipula- tion is°to exercise direct extension, before adducting and making traction on the phalanx in dorsal flexion. Should reduction prove impossible, open arthrotomy should be at once performed by a free wi., 401 -Dislocation of the Thumb. Traction on the displaced phalanx by means of the rib- • American forceps. incision on the palmar aspect. Eesisting structures, as portions of ligaments or the short flexor tendons, may be divided or pulled aside with a fine hook, and thus reduction be effected. _ In old cases the base of the phalanx may be excised. I would advise this treatment in preference to subcutaneous tenotomy; for I have seen failure to reduce this dislocation on more than one occasion, even when the operator had divided the structures round the joint with the tenotome so freely and repeatedly that there appeared little left. Should much traction be required in dislocations of the phalanges, t le “ American forceps” (Fig. 401), the “ Indian puzzle, or a clove hitch made with a soft bandage, are useful adjuncts.

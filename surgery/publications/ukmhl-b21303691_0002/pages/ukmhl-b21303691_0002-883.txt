In fractures near the base the neck is driven into the shaft and troclianter (page 838), the anterior wall cracks but does not pene- trate; the posterior sinks deeply in beneath the trochanteric line Fig. 2S0.

Fig. 278 sliows that tlie base of the neck was driven deeply mto the shaft and troclianter.

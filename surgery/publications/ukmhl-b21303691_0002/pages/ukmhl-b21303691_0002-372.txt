328 SURGICAL DISEASES DUE TO PARASITES. The wonn infects many animals—swine, rats, cats, dogs, hedge- hogs, moles, horses, calves, rabbits, guineapigs, etc. When an animal is fed on flesh containing the embryos, the woiTtn develops rapidly, and fully-developed examples may be obtained from the intestine at the end of two days. The female is the larger A Pig. 58.—Sections of Muscle containing Trichina Spiralis. A. Longitudinal; B, transverse. to i of an inch in length), and when six days old is found to contain numerous embryos, averaging at least 150 to each parent. The male worm is shorter to ^ of an inch in length), and pro- vided with two conical projections at its caudal extremity. The embryos set free in the intestinal canal migrate into the tissues, and are carried by the lymph stream into the general cir- culation (Askanazy), thence to be distributed in the voluntary muscles—their special habitat. Here they acquire an alimentary canal and rudimentary sexual organs, and at the end of the fourth week from leaving the intestine they assume a roUed-up form, and an adventitious capsule is developed around them (Fig. 58). This capsule is provided by the enclosing tissue, and more or less rapidly undergoes calcification, this process reaching a high degree at the end of twelve months. The parasite now remains quiescent, and may in time degenerate and perish; or by the death of its host, when an animal, it may be transferred to a new one, and again proceed to full development. Human muscle containing the para- site is pale or reddish-grey in colour, and the fibres tend to lose their normal striation and become fissured. Mode of infection.—The disease is acquired by eating trichinous flesh—commonly pork, either raw or imperfectly cured or cooked. Symptoms.—The special symptoms of trichinosis depend on the afiection of the voluntary muscles; these appear in a week or a

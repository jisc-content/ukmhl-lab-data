237 bullet wounds. Number of wounds made by bulletS.-There may be only (me wound in cases where the bullet has lodged; or two when it has escaped; or the wounds may be multiple, the bullet splitting against a bone, and thus causing more than one aperture of exit, or one bullet may pass through more than one part of the body. More rarely two projec- tiles haA'^e caused a single wound. The aperture of exit is more often multiple than that of entrance. With the magazine bul- let the number of wounds generally will be greater. Fig. 43.—Bullets Martini Henry: 2, Needle gun; 3, Chasaepot; 4, Hound nnllet; 5, Snider; 6, Enfield. Primary general symp- . , , „ m Pain may in some cases not be experienced at all. Ihe wounded man may be first made aware of his wound by the hiemorrhage from the part. Again, no pain may be felt at the moment of impact, but shortly afterwards the most excruciating anguish comes on, especially if the bullet have lodged under the skin, and is stretching it. Again, if nerve trunks be injured, the pain is especially great. The gravity of the wound also has an influence ; an extensive wound of the thigh is markedly painful. The smaller the missile and the greater its velocity, the, less is the pain. The soft parts when wounded are less painful than the bones. In character the pain has been likened to that caused by a blow with a heavy stick, or to that of an electric shock. Race and na- tionality appear to influence its intensity. Mussulmans would seem to be comparatively insensitive. Fischer, in the Bohemian War, found the Italians and Poles * Metlord" B?a' most susceptible, the ITungai’ians least, and the Ger- mans midway in this respect. Finally, pain may be entirely absent from the aperture of entrance, and only felt at that of exit, leading the wounded man to imagine he has only been struck at the latter spot.

The atlvantage of a long diametcv in resisting flexion is obvious; the weights re- quired to break the tibia by acting on its crest and on its inner surface are as 17 to 12. The effects of direct violence depend upon tlie weight, momen turn, consistence, form, etc., of the injuring body; upon the strength, mobility, protection by soft parts, and such like conditions of the bone. It compresses (crushes) a supported bone, bends an unsupported. The soft parts covering the bone are necessarily damaged—bruised, tom, stripped off, crushed, and killed —according to the nature of the ac- cident, and the form and position of the bone. The action of v indirect violence is by no means so simple, and it is not possible clearly to explain why in similar. accidents such dissimilar re- sults ensue as a fracture of the os calcis, of the base of the skull, or of some intermediate bone, from a fall on the feet.

Indirect violence may act by producing one or other of the following effects:—(1) Pure flexion, as when, the lower part of the leg being fixed, the body falls to one or other side. The mechanism is*simihir when a malleolus is broken off by pressure of the astragalus against its tip in extreme supination or pronation of tne foot.

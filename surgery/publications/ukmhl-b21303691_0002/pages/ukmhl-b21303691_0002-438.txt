394 SYPHILIS tal?es the form of—(1) an ci-ytlicin:i or roseola, consisting of scattered pinkish spots on the trunk and limbs (especially the flexor aspects), which diminish or disappear on stretching the skin, and which are not unlike the eruption of measles. Next in frequency and order of appearance comes (2) a papular or liclienoid sypliilide. This may consist of either small or large papules, which are composed of masses of exudation cells, accompanied by congestion and alteration of the walls of the small vessels in and close to the papules (thickening of the coats and cell deposit around them). A certain amount of proliferation and Fig. 79.—Condyloma at the Margin of the Anus, from a patient with secondary syphilis. The surface of the condyloma is seen to be intersected by fissures, and to have a somewhat granular appearance. inflammatory change is common in the epithelium covering the papules, and hence there may be a thin dry scale on each, forming the papulo-squamous syphilide. The large papules are of the same nature, and if desquamation occurs on them, a more or less close resemblance to common psoriasis is produced. If situated on parts of the skin habitually moist, such as the scrotum, the vulva, around the anus, and at the lip-commissures, these large papules have a peculiar- appearance, becoming covered witli a delicate whitish kind of false membrane, secreting a thin discharge (which is extremely liable to convey infection to others), having a broad base and a smooth surface. They are then known as condylomata; and very simihar lesions occur on the mucous membrane of the mouth lining the lips, the tongue, tonsils, palate, etc. Although these are frequently refer- red to as mucous patches, there is iro essential dillerence (other than their site) between them and condylomata (Fig. 79). Coiidylomata are occasionally met with in such situations as the umbilicus, the

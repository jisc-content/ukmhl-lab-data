(Lancereaui.) of a circumscribed dilatation of the vessels, and gives rise to swell- ings on the surface, varying in size from that of a pea to that of a walnut. These are not painful, except when over-distended ; and if aspirated or punctured—as they have sometimes been under a mis- apprehension of their true nature—they yield a clear or milky coagulating fluid. To a dilatation of these natural channels, causing distension and rupture of lymph spaces in the papillaiy layer of the skin, Hutchinson has applied the term lupus lymphaticus—a some- what misleading appellation (Fig. 188). Both these conditions may be brought about by the pressure of tumours—such as an aneurysm—compressing the thoracic duct, or of malignant tumours in the course of that vessel, or arising in the groin or axilla. The pressure thus exercised may so obstruct the return of chyle in the one case or of lymph in the other, that the vessels beyond become dilated and varicose, and may either burst 6G4 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF LYMPHATICS. the larger lymphatic vessels, in which cystic spaces are formed, often of large size, associated with hypertrophy of the vessel wall and atrophy of the intervening tissue (Fig. 187). Sometimes this dilata- tion gives ruse to a single cyst, the walls of which consist of fibrous tissue lined with epithelium, and the contents of more or less clear fluid. Lyiiiplumg^icctasis is the result of a varicose condition of the lymphatics analogous to that of the blood-vessels, and is most com- mon in the lower limb, especially in the inguinal region. It consists

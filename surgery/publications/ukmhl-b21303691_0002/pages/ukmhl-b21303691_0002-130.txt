SUPPURATION. 86 If fluid be present and no other fallacy have crept in, the fingers of the hand which is kept at rest will feel the impulse of the wave of fluid that has been set in motion by the other hand. Now, in cases where the area to be examined is quite small, the two fingers may be of necessity so close together that the soft tissues are pushed by the one and felt by the other, and thus flu9tuation is erroneously diag- nosed. Perhaps the most common mistake is caused by the false fluctuation induced when palpation is made transversely to muscular fibres. In such circumstances, a very distinct feeling of fluctm ation may be produced across the belly of a muscle even although the hands are kept at a considerable distance from each other ; and, therefore, where a mass of muscles is present in the region to be examined, great care must be taken to test for the presence of fluid by the fingers placed in the direction of, and not transversely to, the muscular fibres. Where the collection of fluid is small, fluctuation may also be ascertained by placing the finger of one hand over the centre of the swelling, in order to feel the sensation, and, grasping the swelling between the fingers of the other hand, which are then sharply approximated to each other ; if fluid be present, the finger of the first hand will be lifted by the wave so set in motion. Or again, if a finger be rapidly pressed mto the part , ■ rest it sets in motion waves of fluid which are leaddy fel , method of investigation, however, is not suitable where the fluid is in a state of tension, it can only be used m cases where the fluid is contained in a lax cavity, and also where there is but little pain on sharp pressure. As a matter of fact centre of a brawny swelling is becoming softened—that is to saj where pus has formed and is approaching the skin—the F^^ce ° an absLs is readily ascertained by passing the the part • where pus is present and superficial, a softened circle will be felt in the middle of the brawny swelling, and an abrupt, sharp, hard edqe around, and where this is found it is quite unnecessary to cause pfin to the patient by testing for fluctuation, because it is m itself an absolute sign of the presence of pus. Where the inflammation is deeply-seated, and the skin is not afi-ected the presence of oedema of the skin over the region of the LSSltionl almost always indicative of abdomen over the tion not uncommonly becomes cedematous; “f one may feel certain, without further examination, that pus is prese ZlZh Besides, ks has been already said, where an acute >n"an . mation has lasted for four or five days it is almost certain that p “Ttke"":id^^^ essential to know whether pus is present before makins an incision, punctures may of the swelling is of a dus^ purple oSom- and becomes gradually thinner till the yellow pus can

RODENT ULCER. 125 The disease spreads extremely slowly, and may go on for many years, gradually destroying the parts in which it is situated, both in superficial extent and in depth. It is not uncommon, also, to find that the centre, or indeed the greater part of the sore, may become a])parently cicatrised, but the cicatrix very soon breaks down again, and the ulceration proceeds. The disease is, in the great majority of cases, only locally Pig. 22.—Ala of Nose destroyed by a Rodent Ulcer. malignant, and it is seldom that there is any glandular enlaro’ement in connection with it, but this does occasionally occur. It generally attacks oldish people, chiefly men from fifty years of age and upwards. It most usually begins in the face, more especially about the root of the nose and the region of the eyelids, and it goes on destroyincr the various structures which it meets with, eating into the nasal bones and the superior maxilla, or the frontal bones ; and it may ultimately cause death either from hemorrhage or, after havimr destroyed the bones of the skull, from septic meningitis. It may° however, be found in any part of the body, perhaps the next most frequent seat to the face being the back of the hand, just as is the case with lupus ; and this may very possibly be explained bv direct infection from rubbing the face with the hand. On making microscopical sections of the wall or base of the ulcer, one finds a typical cancerous structure, namely, epithelial cells penetrating into the tissues in the form of tubes, and giving rise to the alveolar arrangement found in epitheliomata (Fig. 23). The epithelial

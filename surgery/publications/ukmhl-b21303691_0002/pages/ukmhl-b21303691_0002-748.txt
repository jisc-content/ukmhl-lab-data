In some of these cases a great excess ^ ’ of callus is formed. {See Art. XXIX., page 726.) Perforating ulcers.—Tliese are much more commonly seen in patients who are the subjects of tabes dorsalis, but occasionally complicate other diseases of the spinal cord or of the peripheral nerves and occur also in diabetic subjects. When complicating tabes, they may develop either as one of the early symptoms or at any period during the progress of the disease. {See page 112.) Symptoms. — These ulcers are usually situated on the sole of the foot, and especially affect the balls of the great toes, though they may occur under the balls of any of the toes, and have been seen in one or two instances on the hand. They commence with a corn-like thickening of the epi- dermis, which may precede ulcera- tion for several months; but when once found, the ulcers evince a special tendency to ‘‘perforate the subjacent structures rather than to spread over the neigh- bouring skin (Fig. 19<)- consequence of this perforation, the metatarso-phalangeal joint is freouently involved, and. aa the result o£ tl.e suppurative arthrit.s IK cartilase may be destroyed, and its articular surface be- pome carious (Fi^^. 198).

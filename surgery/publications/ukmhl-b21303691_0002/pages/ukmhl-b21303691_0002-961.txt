TUMOURS OF BONE. 919 Pai’osteal sarcomata, although less malignant, must be treated on almost the same lines as the subperiosteal, as they infiltrate the surrounding tissues, and cannot be dissected off the bones without the danger of local recurrence (Figs. 358, 359). 2. Endosteal or central sarcoma.—Being, as a nile, mucli less malignant than the subperiosteal growth, re-section of the portion of bone involved, or an amputation close to the disease, may fairly be entertained. If there be good reason to think, from its comparatively slow growth and pulsation, that it is a giant-celled sarcoma, re-section should always be done, provided that a useful limb will be left Fig. 358.—Parosteal Sarcoiua from Foot of a Woman aged 40, under the writer’s care.

This is certainly the case in the bones of the fore-arm, but in the femur and tibia some doubt may reasonably be felt as to whether the patient will not be better oft' after an amputation than after re-section, although by either method the disease may be eradicated. If the central growth proves after excision to be a round or spindle-celled sarcoma, the case must be most carefully watched, as local recurrence is much more likely to take place than after a giant-celled sarcoma. Amputation well above the limits of the disease must be at once performed on the first suspicion of such a recniTence of growth. Sarcoma of inc1ivi<1ual bones.

In exceptional circumstances the amputation might be successfully accomplished just below the knee, through the

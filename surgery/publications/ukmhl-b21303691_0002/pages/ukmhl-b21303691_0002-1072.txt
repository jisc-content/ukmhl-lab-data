1030 DISLOCATIONS. The displacements of the phalanges resemble those of the upper extremity. The same difficulty has been found in the reduction of the first phalanx of the great toe as is encountered in the thumb. There is great practical difficulty in making extension upon a single metatarsal bone or toe phalanx, and I am inclined to think that the open method, by re-section, or the division of opposing ligaments, would be applicable to obstinate and incon- venient cases of these displacements.

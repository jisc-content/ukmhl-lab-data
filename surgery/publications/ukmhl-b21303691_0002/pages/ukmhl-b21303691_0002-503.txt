459 fibromata. skin has been described under a vaiiety of names as fibro-cellular tZT, pachycMocele (Mott), and dermaiolys^s It consists of an overgrowth of skin and subcutaneous tissue, which may affect a n on lil'pi the scalp or involve a large extent of skin on the small area lilve tne scaip, i ° j i „ foPio /■R'lV 108\ trunk and limbs, causing it to hang in pendulous folds (Fig. 1U«). Sometimes it as- sumes the form of discrete nodules scattered over the skin, the nodules varying in size, the extremes being represented by a pea and a walnut. Nodules and pen- dulous folds are occasionally asso- ciated in the same individual, and several cases have been reported in which mollus- cum nodules have been associated with a multitude of neuromata on the principal nei-ve-trunks. The histology of the nodules and the pendulous flaps is similar, and appears to be represented by an overgrowth of the fibrous tissue of the skin and the subcutaneous tis- sues generally. Concerning the cause of this over- growth nothing is known ; it affects men and women equally, and is not confined to any race or clime. In many cases in which the disease has been confined to a limited area the pendulous masses have been successfully excised, and the subsequent records of the patients have demonstrated that the disease shows no disposition to recur or to manifest itself in any other region of the body. It will be necessary to refer again to molluscum fibrosum in dealing with neuromata. Fig. 108.—Molluscum Fibrosum. This tumour was successfully removed by Mott.

HIP JOINT DISEASE. 1077 looser posterior part yielded first, the strong anterior tmyielding portion could only be relaxed by flexion, abduction, and eversion. The only difference between what takes place in this case after death and when the oint is inflamed during life is that, in the latter case, the patient relaxes the painful parts, while in tlie former the distension is the mechanical cause of the Iâ€™elaxation of the Y-ligament and capsule. The principle is the same, and explains the whole phenomenon without invoking reflexes. This ex- periment was originally made by Bonnet many years ago, but its correct interpretation was not forthcoming for a long time afterwards. A patient in this condition will generally lie upon the affected side, with the leg flexed upon the thigh; but, if placed upright, he will lower the sole of the foot, and rest it on the ground. This necessitates his tilting the pelvis downwards and forwards on the affected side to make up for raising of the leg, due to the flexion and abduction of the thigh. In this position, if the pain be great, he will probably rest his hand upon the affected thigh just above the knee, with the double object of steadying the limb and of throwing the weight of the body directly upon the leg, without the interposition of tbP Hmk ^ probably support the limb with his hands in the flexed attitude.

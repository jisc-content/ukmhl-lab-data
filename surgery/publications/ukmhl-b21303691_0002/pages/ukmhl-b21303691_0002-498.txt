Tumours of the testis and parotid whicli contain cartilage ai-e not chondromata, but chondrifying sarcomata. 2. Ecchondroses.—These may be defined as small local out- growths of cartilage : they are very common along the edges of the articular cartilage of the knee-joint; ecchondroses are not rare in relation with the triangular cartilage of the nose, and are of occasional occurrence in connection with the laryngeal cartilages. 3. Loose cartilages.—Bodies of various kinds are found loo.se in the cavities of joints, but those to be considered under the head of chondromata, in addition to de- tached ecchon- droses, are pieces of hyaline carti- lage found hang- ing from the syn- ovial membrane by naiTow stalks, or occupying de- pressions in the bone, from which they are occa- sionally dislodged. The origin of these loose cartilages will be dealt vdth in the article de- voted to Diseases OF Joints. (Art. XXXIII.) Treatment.—The operative treatment of chondromata has been greatly simplified since surgeons have appreciated the fact that these tumours are encapsuled. Hence when it is necessary to in- terfere with a chondroma, even in cases where several of these tumours are present, it has become customary to incise the capsule and enucleate the tumour: this simple method is very successfuL Exceptionally, cases come under observation demanding more serious measures: for instance, in such a case as is i-epresented in Fig. 97, the hand may become so burdensome that patients have asked to have the limb amputated, and their wish has been complied with. 3. Osteomata (Osseous Tumours). An osteoma may be defined as an ossifying chondroma. The genus contains two .species: (1) Compact or ivoiy osteoma; (2) cancellous osteoma.

EXTRACTION OF TEETH. 945 In extracting a molar-tootli from the mandible, the ^beginner is very apt to pull hard upon it; suddenly the tooth yields, and the forceps conies in contact with the crown of an upper molar or bicuspid: sometimes the concussion is so gi-eat as to knock off a part or the whole of the crown. Knowledge of the liability should be sufficient to prevent such an accident. Lastly, should a tooth or stump fall into the patientâ€™s mouth, do not proceed with the extracting until it is recovered and removed.

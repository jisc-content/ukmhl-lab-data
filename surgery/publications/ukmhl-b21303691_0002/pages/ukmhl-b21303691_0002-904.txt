(A. E. Barker.) .silk are drawn tight, firmly knot- ted and cut short. The patients walk in five weeks, apparently with bony union. G. E. T-wynam “ tyres ” the patella, i.e. throws a ring of wire or silk round it in the attached fibrous tissues : in some comminuted cases with sepa- ration it may be useful; without a special needle it is a somewhat diffi- cult suture to pass. Mayo Robson passes a bonnet- pin through the quadriceps tendon and another through the ligamentum patellse, each touching bone : the projecting ends are wired together (Fig. 313). Robson believes that he gets bony union. In three cases I obtained close fibrous union. Compound fractures should be treated by disinfection and suture of some kind, unless other bones are comminuted or soft part seriously injured, when excision or amputa- tion must be considered. Fractures of the leg bones. Sepa- ration of tlie upper epiphysis of the tibia.—The upper epiphysis of the tibia is of large area, but not deep; it sends a tri- an<^ular process downwards in front, which ends in the tubercle. Ossification begins just after birth as a rule,_ and ends at 22. It is much less frequently displaced than the lower epiphysis of the femur, owing to the attachment of the semi-membranosus and Fig. 313. — Mayo Robson s Method of aiipniximating the fragments after f™']*' verse fracture of the patella (A.

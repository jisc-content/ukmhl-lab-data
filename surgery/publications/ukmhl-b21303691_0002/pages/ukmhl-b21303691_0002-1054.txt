Bearing this in mind, the surgeon will do well to leave such a case alone, unless he has complete confi- dence in his practical knowledge of perfect aseptic surgery. With elaborate care and precaution, it would be justifiable freely to open the joint in such a case, and divide those structures which could thus be certainly felt and seen, preventing reduction. The wound in the capsule and soft parts over the joint should be accurately united with scrupulous attention to every detail that may directly or indirectly promote rapid and perfect union.

Dislocation of the fibula from the tibia, causation au<i rl'issificatioii—The upper end of the fibula may be displaced fiom the tibia forwards, backwards, or upwards. In the latter accident, which is very exceptional, one case havmg been recorded by Mai -raiane, the whole bone is forced upwards, its lower extremity bemg also displaced. The usual cause of dislocation forwards or bac^ wards is a heavy blow, or crushing vio ence du’ectly appli^ to the head of the bone. Displacement may also be brought about by t violent action of the biceps. Dislocation of the lower end of the fibula from the tibia is said to have occurred from direct violence and also in some dislocations of the astragalus. In fracture,” the lower end of the fibula is torn ^ Dislocation of the upper end must not be confounded v th (1) umluc mobility of the head of the bone from laxity of the ligaments, o

SYSTEM OF SUROERY. I. SUEGICAL BAOTBBIOLOGT. By german SIMS WOODHEAD, M.D., Director of the Laboratories of the Royal Colleges of Physicians {Lond.) and Surgeons [Eng.). GENERAL CHARACTERS OF BACTERIA. Before giving a description of those bacteria that bear a definite relation to surgical diseases, it will be necessary to describe very briefly the general characters of this whole group of micro-organisms which it is now generally agreed are closely allied to lower vegetable forms of life, certain of the more highly organised forms with which we have to deal being classified in well-recognised groups of plants. The term bacteria (Gr. fiaicTtfpia; jSaKrpor, dim. (iaKn'jpiot', a staff), though now well understood and generally recognised as including rounded organisms or cocci, is evidently a misnomer. Bacteria form a group, the members of which have a vegetative growth; they multiply by a process of fission or direct division, each organism as it increases in size dividing into twoâ€”hence the name fission fungi, schizomycetes, or sekizoyhytes. In some cases this process of division is complete, the rod or the coccus (Gr. KOKKOQ, a berry) simply dividing into two separate organisms ; in other cases the two organisms may remain in contact, and even with a slight bond of union between them, forming what is called a diplococcus. The diplococcus may undergo still further division, and if the individual organisms still remain attached, and division is in one plane only, transverse to the longitudinal axis, a chain or streptococcus (Gr. arpeirros, a collar; arpewTa, a necklace) may be formed. A strepto-bacillus or streptothrix is formed in exactly the same way. Where there are several planes of division, so that aii irregular or mulberry-shaped mass is formed, a staphylococcus (Gr. ara<pv\)), a bunch of grapes) is the result. Where the rods increase con- siderably in length, with or without marked subdivision into shorter lengths, the leptothrix (Gr. XETrrdcj slender, thin) is formed. In addition to these more common forms we have spiral or

5S4 DISEASES OF DLOOD-VESSELS. and the skin is destroyed for a sufficient depth. Electrolysis is an excellent method of destroying small phlebectasies as well as larger growths. (4) Caustics of many kinds are employed and in certain cases are very good. Nitric acid or acid nitrate of mercury, and the fine point of a Paquelin’s cautery are the best to use. They are particularly suitable for very superficial ntevi, involving less than the whole thickness of the skin, and for scattered points of nsevus. (5) Injection of coagulants is but little practised and should be entirely superseded by electrolysis. Owing to the danger of embolism, a temporary ligature must in every case be placed around the nievus for at least fifteen minutes after the injection; perchloride of iron, a solution of tannin, or pure carbolic acid are the fluids employed, and only a very small quantity of either of them is injected. (6) Setons and vaccination are employed to excite inflammation in the nsevus and so to obliterate the blood-spaces, but there is great practical difficulty in so regulating the area of inflammation as to make it exactly coextensive with the nsevus, and its severity, so that it may “ cure ” the nsevus without exciting sloughing or deep sup- puration. Superficial nsevi may be cured by vaccination, but other methods of treatment are to be preferred; deeper nsevi have been treated by passing threads soaked in vaccine lymph through them. (7) Scarification has been advocated for the treatment of extensive very superficial nsevi such as “ port wine stains,” but the results of this method have been very unsatisfactory.

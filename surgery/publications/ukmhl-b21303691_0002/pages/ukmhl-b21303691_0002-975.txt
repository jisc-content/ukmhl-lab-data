(After Hutchinson.) great disjilacement of the teeth and marked alterations in the con- formation of the alveolar borders of the jaws. When very lai-ge they will protrude beyond the lips. These tumours were formerly called “ malignant epulides.” (See also page 914.) Periosteal sarcomata of the jaws are rare before the age of fifteen, but they are occa- sionally found in very young children. (See also page 914.) Myeloid sarcomata occur in the maxilla, and, as a rule, arise in connection with the nasal or alveolar processes, and occasionally in the pre-maxilla. In the mandible they spring from the body of the bone, and expand its inner and outer plates. To judge from current de- scriptions, it would be ima- gined that myeloid sarcomata are fairly frequent in the alveolar borders of the jaws j this error is due to the circumstance that sufficient attention has not been devoted to sarcomata arising in connection with the developing teeth. When the specimens preserved in museums as examples of myeloid sarcomata are critically examined they will be found to fall in three categories : (1) fibrous odontomes ; (2) sarcomata origi- nating in the follicles of teeth; (3) myeloid sarcomata. The char- acters of myeloid sar- comata are described on pages 468 and 914. 2. Tumours of the gums.—These be- long to four genera : fibromata, sarcomata, papillomata, and epi- thelioma.

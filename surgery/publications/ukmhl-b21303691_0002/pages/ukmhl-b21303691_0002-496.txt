Fatty tumours are not uncommon in the middle line of the back, especially in the lumbo-sacral regions overlying the sacs of spinse bifidai (Fig. 99). Intradural lipomata may bo associated with the masked variety of spina bifida (spina bifida occulta). Clinical features.—In most instances fatty tumours admit of almost certain diag- nosis, especially the subcu- taneous species: their lobula- tion, indefinite boundaries, and intimate union with the skin cause them to be readily recognised. In the groin they are apt to be confounded with hemite, or even with abscesses. When seated on the face or scalp (rare situa- tions) they are easily con- founded with sebaceous cysts. When a lipoma grows from the periosteum of a long bone it will simulate a sarcoma; embedded in a muscle it will lead to most divergent opinions. In the middle line of the back it is very liable to be confounded with spina bifida, or a dermoid cyst, and will then require much cir- cumspection in treatment. A lipoma within the abdomen is almost invariably a chmcal puzzle. Treatment. — Subcuta- neous lipomata are easily enucleated: if pedunculated, their detachment is very simple. The diffuse variety is rarely submitted to operation. When fatty tumours are situated where they are liable to irritation from petticoat-bands, braces, and other articles of clothing, they should he excised. The removal of a subcutaneous lipoma is one ot the simplest proceedings in surgery, but the extii'pation of a large sub- peritoneal fatty tumour is invariably a difficult matter, and otten attended with grave risks. 99.—Meniv2geal Lipoma simulating Spina Bifida.

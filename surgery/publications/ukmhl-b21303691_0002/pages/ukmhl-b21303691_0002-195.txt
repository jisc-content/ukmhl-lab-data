Having got rid in this way of aU the dead tissue, pressure is applied, and the bleeding is arrested, and then strong nitric acid is painted or rubbed into the raw surface. This nitric acid is allowed to act for five or ten minutes, fresh applications being repeatedly made. At the end of that time, if one be thoroughly satisfied that every portion of the disease has been destroyed, the action of the acid may be arrested by the application of carbonate of soda.

DISEASES OF BOHeS. 922 not uncommon, especially after scirrhus of the breast. In these cases carcinoma may develop in the cancellous tissues of any of the bones, and may give rise to spontaneous fracture or to persistent pain. In the latter the post-morievi examination may reveal secondary gi-owths in the bodies of the vertebrae. Epithelioma frequently involves bone by direct extension from the primary growth, especially in the case of the lip and tongue. Cystic tumours of bone.—Those which are connected with the teeth will be found described under Diseases of the Jaws (Art. XXXI., page 935). Both sarcoma and chondroma of bone may contain cavities filled with serous and bloody fiuid. The large majority of cystic tumours of bone occur under one or other of these headings, and the reader must be referred to the preceding pages for an account of their origin. Hydatids may also—although very rarely—produce cystic cavities in bone. Sevei’al specimens are preserved in the museums of the Boyal College of Surgeons, St. Thomas’s Hospital, and Guy’s Hos- pital. The bone becomes thin and expanded, and gives rise to the symptoms of a central cystic tumour. If tapped, a diagnosis may be made from the examination of the fluid. But a spontaneous fracture is sometimes the first indication of the disease; and an operation for re-section has demonstrated its nature by the escape of hydatids. The treatment would consist in the removal of the cysts, leaving only, perhaps, a shell of bone. But under modern conditions of wound treatment this shell may be expected to fill with healthy granulations. Amputation would be rarely called for. {Sec also page 321.)

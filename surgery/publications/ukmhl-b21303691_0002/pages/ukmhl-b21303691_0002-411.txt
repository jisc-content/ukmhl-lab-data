The spongioid bone deposited in the concavities of the curvatures ossifies in like manner, and thus strong bony buttresses are produced, the bones often fu^^^^ strengthened by narrowing or obliteration of the medullary canal. Special deform- ities. Skull.— Changes in the bones of the head, particu- larly in those ossified in membrane, are the earhest to occur, commencing even in the third month. Longitudinal pro- minences in the marginal growing portions of the fiat bones mark out the lines of the sutures; and this is particu- larly well seen at the coronal suture. The sutures themselves are deficient in firm- ness and resistance, and the fontanelles remain open until a late date. The large anterior fontanelle often closes only as late as the sixth year. Certain parts of the skull —notably the v-i frontal and parietal bones—gain much in thickness, ^ while the occipital may remain abnormally thin. The incapacity of the imperfect bone to resist pressure may be evidenced by the develop ment of small soft areas from to ^ an inch in diameter, in which the skull may be thinned, or true osseous tissue may be entirely absent. These soft yielding spots are most common in the region behind the parietal eminence, and in the occipital bone. They occur, however, rarely in the temporal, and even in the frontal bone. Tliey are usually not numerous, but have been met with to the number of thirty. This condition is known under the name of craniotabes, given to it by its original describer (Elsasser).

999 DISLOCATIONS OF TIIF HIP. sucli m.anipulatious by the liands of assistants, or a broad padded belt fastened to staples, or strongly strapped round the bed (Fig. 405). Provided the tliigh bo well flexed, considerable force may be exerted upon it by ti-action to lift the head of the bone into the acetabulum. Should manipulations fail, they may again be repeated on another occasion. There is seldom any difficulty in reducing a recent dislocation by manipulation if deep ether anaesthesia be induced. Old dislocations of the femur backivards.—When the displace- ment has been left uni’educed some weeks or months, great diffi- culties may be experienced, and I would not attempt to lay down Fig. 406.—TJnraluced Backward Dislocation of the Hip. Tlie acetabulum is filled up and new cavity is formed on the dorsum ilii. The head of the femur is altered in shape. any time as to when it is right to attempt reduction. It may be pointed out that (1) manipulation is at least as likely to suc- ceed as the use of pulleys or violent extension. (2) That the age, vigour, and occupation of the patient must be considered. (3) That manipulations, though they may fail in reduction, improve the case y Jiealving down adhesions. (4) That violent manipulations may cause such accidents as injuries to the sciatic nerve or vessels, ex- tensive extravasation of blood and diffuse abscess, or fracture of the neck of the femur, the limb becoming mobile and everted with obvious crepitus. This latter accident I have myself witnessed. J t would seem safer in these cases to attempt reduction by freely exposing tlie parts by a long incision posteriorly, and after dividiiifr resistant stnictures to replace the head of tlie femur. Excision o tlic displaced licad is also easily and certainly performed.

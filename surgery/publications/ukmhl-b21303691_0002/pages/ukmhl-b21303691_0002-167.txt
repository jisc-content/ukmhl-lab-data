After a time the ulceration tends to assume a more or less serpiginous form, healing often taking place at one side, while ulceration occurs at the other. (See Art. XX.) In the matter of diagnosis, the chief feature in the typical tuberculous ulcer is the thin undermined skin around the edge, and Fig. 21.—Case of Lupus in lupoid ulceration the presence of minute nodules at the margin of the ulcer and around it, often semi-transparent, and presenting the typical apple-jelly appearance. The syphilitic ulceration assumes the serpiginous form, tending to heal at one side while it progresses at the other; or it assumes a tubercular form—the so-called syphilitic lupus —progressing with much greater rapidity than ordinary lupus with much larger nodules, and destroying bones as well as the soft parts. As regards the treatment of the tubercular form of ulcers, local measures are of the greatest importance, the essential principle being to remove the disease as completely as possible. This may be done in various ways, either by scraping, by the application of various caustics, or by excision. I need only here express my preference

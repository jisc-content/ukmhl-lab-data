Gonorrhoea in the female.â€”Some allusion has already been made to this, and space will only allow of a very brief further notice. The vulva and the vaginal wall are first affected, the canal of the cervix uteri is often involved, and spreading up from this the lining membrane of the aterus, the Fallopian tubes, and the ovaries are liable to become inflamed. The urethra pai-ticipates in only about 20 per cent, of the cases, and stricture is an almost un- known result in women. Long-persisting leucorrhoea, sterility, and pelvic peritonitis (occasionally suppurative) are amongst the compli- cations to be feared. The treatment of gonorrhoea in women is almost entirely local, and consists in warm hip baths, frequent vaginal douches, and irri- gation through an indiarubber tube, introduced well into the vagina. The various astringents and antiseptics already mentioned are useful, and when the disease has become chronic, glycerine of tannic acid and powdered alum or tannin (applied on pledgets of cotton-wool introduced to the top of the vagina through a speculum) should be tried.

932 DISEASES OF THE JAWS. service, these meas\ires must be adopted in the earliest stages of the disease, before there is wide infiltration of tissues, or secondary foci in internal organs. TUMOURS OF THE JAWS. These will be considered under four headings, according as they ai'ise from (1) bone, (2) gums, (3) teeth, or occupy the (4) antrum. 1. Tumours arising in bone and periosteum of the jaws.—^These belong to the same genera as those common to bones in general, and include osteomata and sarcomata. Osteomala.—These are somewhat rare tumours, more frequent on the mandible than the maxilla, and are usually sessile (Fig. 363). Fig. 363.- Osteoma of Mandible. (St. George’s Hospital Musenm.) Many cases, formerly described as osteomata or exostoses of the laws, were examples of leontiasis ossea, shells of bone due to ossihc^ tion of periosteal sarcomata, and large odontomes. Locahsed oub growths of bones, often described as exostoses, are not infrequent m connection with the nasal process of the maxilla. The afiection sometimes bilateral (Fig. 364) and its cause is obscure. Small irregular osseous prominences often occur along the alveolai holders of the maxilla and mandible. (See page 907.) . . . , Sarcomata These occur at any age, even in infants a tew months old. They usually spring from the penosteum or mucm neriosteum and are equally common in both jaws. They beioiio to the romid and spindle-celled species; and, as a J great rapidity, recur quickly after removal, and attain to „ie.it species, as is usual with these tumours in other situations, often contain tracts of hyaline cartilage, henc many tulurs, erroneously described by previous surgical writeis as enchondromata of the jaws, belong to this ^^rcomata springing from the gums usually pioject into tnc .„aceTtwfen 5, A and the teU,; n'heu large, they produce

127 DIAGNOSIS. Differential diagnosisâ€”The distinctions appertaining to the syphilitic, tuberculous, epitheliomatous, and rodent ulcers are placed in comparison with one another in the following table TcBitnotri-ocs. EPlTIIBLIOMATOnS. Tertiary Syphilitic. 1. Present at any age. Previous history of syphilis. 2. Edges sharply cut, not thickened; of ten healing at one side, and spreading at the other. 3. Surface smooth; not covered with healthy granula- tions. 4. May he single or multiple, and there may he gummata around. No gland infection. Extends fairly rapidly. Lupusheginsin child- hood or young adult life. Tuher- culous ulcer se- condary to ahoess in glands, etc., at any age. In true tuheroulous ulcer edges thin, undermined, pur- plish ; no ten- dency to heal. In lupus soft hreak- ing-dowu nodules at margin and no- dules aroimd. Surface soft, pale ; may he promi- nent. Unhealthy granulations. Often enlarged glands in vicini^; not necessarily secondary to the ulceration and other tuberculous disease else- where. Course sluggish. In advanced life. Very seldom be- fore thirty. Edges raised, hard, warty ; no ten- dency to heal. Surface hard and warty,sometimes sloug;hy; and on drying and squeezing the mass numerous small white points may he seen. Single. Usually; neighbouring glands enlarged after three to six months. Varies in rapidity; the worst forms ex- tending quickly. Kodent. Usually old age. Seldom before fifty. Edges hard, hut not usually markedly raised; sharply cut. Surface hard, do- pressed, smooth; sometimes tem- porary patches of epithelium over it. Single usually ; very slow in its pro- gress. Glands not enlarged, or only very late.

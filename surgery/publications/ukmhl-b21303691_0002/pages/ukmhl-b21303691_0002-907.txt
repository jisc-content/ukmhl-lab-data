FRACTURES OF THE LEG BONES. 865 glides up and back and out behind the upper (Fig. 314). In high fractures the quadriceps often seems to cause prominence of the upper fragment, but it is impossible to eliminate the effect of dropping backwards of the lower fragment. Other dis- placements are illus- trated in Figs. 315, 316, 317. Treat- ment. — W h e Rg. 319.—Cline’s Splints applied with webbing Bands. A bandage lia^'tieen begun round the foot, and may be carried up the leg, but is not neces- sary. Tlie limb has been laid on its outer aide upon a pillow. there is dis- placement, setting is best accomplished with the knee fully bent to relax the calf muscles. Extension is made from the foot; counter-extension from the lower third of the thigh, which is hrmly grasped by an assistant. Rotatory deformity is best avoided by comparing the injured with the sound limb, and endeavouring to copy the form of the latter. A couple of lateral plaster splints, shaped like Cline’s splints (Fig. 318), may be moulded to the limb at once and fixed with a bandage; this can be cut up in front, should much swelling appear, and the splint be reapplied with a fresh bandage. Or for the first few days movable splints may be used. None are better than Cline’s for fractures at or be- low the middle. Two outside Cline’s are more secure than an outside and inside, un- less it is desired to produce marked in- version of the foot. The splints are lined with boric lint, and buckled on as shown in Fig. 319. The limb may be left free or slung; at first the latter is better. If j .1 . , there be much ten- dency to dropping back of the lower fragments, Cline’s splints do ^™old’s or a MacIntyre’s splint may be used. _ One or other of these should be employed for fractures above the middle, unless plaster is used.

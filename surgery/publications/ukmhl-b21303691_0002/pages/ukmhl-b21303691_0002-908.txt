The limb is placed on the padded back splint and secured to its foot piece and lower part; any extension required Fig. 321.—AmolcVs Splint applied and slung on Bloxam’s Cradle. The eversion of the foot shown is quite insufllcient. is now made, counter-extension being provided at the thigh; whilst this is maintained, a bandage is carried from the fracture up to the top of the splint. The side pieces are now buckled on, and the splint is slung in a special cradle by means of straps passed through lateral projections from the back splint. It should be placed so that the toes point up and out in the position of rest; or the foot may be fixed in this position across the foot piece, and the splint hung straight. MacIntyre's splint (Fig. 322) is a posterior gutter splin.t of iron, with a screw arrangement for varying the angle between thigh and leg pieces, and with a ver- tical foot piece, sliding in lateral slots for purposes of extension, and fixed at any spot by a screw nut. The foot piece is left loose and pushed well up ; the back splint is padded. A sock having a tape attached on the sole aspect is drawn on to the foot, and the limb is placed on the splint. The tape is carried over the apex of the foot piece and fastened round a button on the lower surface ; the foot is thus held up without much pressure on the heel. The leg above the fracture and thigh is fixed to the S2:>lint j the foot is raised to the proper level, the angle of the splint regulated to remove all angular deformity; the toes are properly pointed acro.ss the foot piece (tlie Fig. 322.—MacIutjTe's Splint.

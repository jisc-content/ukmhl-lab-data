RICKETS. 368 period of especially active growth of the facial portion of the skull, leads to^ very characteristic changes in the head. The cranium maintains its early preponderance in size, and the forehead appears abnormally prominent, while the face is small and peaked (Fig. 73). _ Tlie deformity most characteristic in the facial bones is that observed in the mandible; defective development of the outer wall rig. 74.—sternum, Costal Cartilages and Bibs in Rickets. The section on the left side shows the irregularity of the epiphysial ossification. (St. Thomas’s Hospital Museum.) of the bone interferes with the acquisition of the proper arched form by the body, the incisor teeth being arranged transversely, and from them the remaining teeth diverge obliquely backwards, the alveolus being somewhat inverted posteriorly, so that the teeth, instead of being vertical, point inwards. The lower margin of the body is everted (Fleischmann). Dentition is much delayed, the first tooth often not appearing before the twelfth month, and subsequent eruption is irregular and retarded; the enamel is defective, striped, and pitted, and the teeth readily wear away to the level of the alveolar margin. Spine*—The earliest and commonest change is an increase in the great dorsal accommodation curve, in which the lumbar spine may also be involved (kyphosis). This is compensated for later by an increase in the cervical, and less in the lumbar convexities, the change in the cervical spine often causing the child to hold tlie head

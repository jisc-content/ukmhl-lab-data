HIP JOINT BISEASE. 1087 Fig. 451.—Thomas’s Single Splint. ' outei' side of the thigh and perfectly useless. For this reason I have for years been in the habit of employing the double splint which cannot slip laterally, and which has, especially in the case of young children, many advantages, which are a set-off against the drawback that it prevents the use of the sound limb. When there is formation of abscess.—When synovial disease is running an unfavourable course in the hip, we are not long left in doubt as to the gravity of the condition. The tuberculous process cannot gain much gi'ound here without at- tacking the cartilaginous sur- faces and the bones, and with- out forming caseous abscesse.s. When the latter are evident we may almost take it for granted that the bones have suffered, and consequently that whatever tlie issue of the case may be, the functions of the joint will be quite destroyed. Such ab- scesses when they have attained to any considerable size will generally soon make their way to the surface, and become evi- dent under the skin. The spots at which this pointing is going to take place will vary with the treatment that has been adopted. As a rule in my practice where the joint has been well supported, especially behind by a Thomas’s splint, the tuberculous debris finds its readiest way to the surface on the anterior aspect of the joint. It passes, as a rule, between the gluteus minimus and rectus tendon, and then between the tensor vaginae femoris and sartonus, to form an abscess in front of the thigh. Sometimes, however, though rarely, it works its way through the thin part of the capsule behind and presents somewhere in the gluteal told, from whence, if neglected, it may burrow in any direc- tion. Again, inflammatory matter pent up in the joint may gradually penetrate into the bursa underneath the psoas muscle as

TUMOURS OF BONE. 913 removed to increase the usefulness of the whole hand. Occasionally the tumour may be excised from the bone in which it grows. On two occasions the writer has succeeded in removing a chondroma which projected only on the flexor aspect of a meta- carpal bone, leaving th-e cortex on the dorsum perfectly free. The tumour gi-ew from the medullary cavity, as is usual in such cases, and when removed, a thin strip of cortical bone only was left in situ Fig. 353.â€”Multiple Chondromata of Hands in a Lad of 18. (From a photograph by Burgess.) (Fig. 351). No recurrence took place, and the patients recovered, with the perfect use of their hands. With regard to the large single chondroma of the long and flat bones, no definite rules can be laid down. One that is steadily, although slowly, increasing in size should be removed, for no one can estimate the size to which it may grow, and the very magnitude of any subsequent operation may in the end deter the operator from incurring the risk to life from shock. It may sometimes be removed from the bone to which it is attached, or the shaft may be so seriously damaged as to necessitate amputation. An exploratory operation must be done, with permission for the surgeon to act in each case as he thinks best for the patient. If there be any reason- able doubt as to its innocent nature, amputation would, of course, be the safest course to pursue.

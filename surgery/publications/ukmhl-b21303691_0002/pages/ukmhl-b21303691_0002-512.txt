468 TUMOURS. 4. Myeloid sarcoma.—This species is composed of tissue histologically resembling the red marrow of bone. When fresh, the cut surface of the tumour is of a deep red or maroon colour, and looks not unlike a piece of Uver. The tissue consists of large numbers of multinuclear cells embedded in a matrix of spindle or round cells (Fig. 115). Many central tumours of bone contain large multinuclear cells, but it is only when these lai-ge cells are present in such quantity as to make up a large part of the tumour that they should be classed as myeloid sarcomata. Myeloid sarco- mata only occur as central tumours of bones. {See Art. XXX.) U5 —Microscopical Chai-acters of a Myeloid Sarcoma, from the acromial end of the i j-xa. X clavicle. 5. AlVBOlar sarcoma.—This is a peculiar species, inasmuch as the cells, contrary to the rule of sarcomata, generally, assume an alveolar disposition, similar to that observed in sections of a carci- noma. Although they mimic the cancers in this respect, there is, however, one great point of difference—they do not mntate the structure of secreting glands. In carefully-prepared sections such tumours rarely cause difficulty, because the cells are usually of large size and even when they resemble epithelium^ it is possible to distinguish a delicate reticulum between the individual cells, a con- dition never found in cancer. , .n t „ Alveolar sarcomata have occasionally been described as gro^l^o in connection with bone, but their common situation is the skin, especially in relation with those congenital defects known as hauy and pigmented moles.

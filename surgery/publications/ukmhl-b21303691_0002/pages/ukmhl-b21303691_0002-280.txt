MILITARY SURGERY. 236 the area laterally affected is more limited, as Kirker has pointed out. Hence, the wound caused by the conoidal will be narrower, have more defined walls, but contain more thoroughly disintegrated tissue. Finally, with regard to (4) rotation, the round bullet revolves on an axis at right angles to its line of flight, and this can be easily deflected by any resistance in its course \ whereas the conoidal bullet, rotating on an axis identical with its line of flight, penetrates the tissues more easily, aiid so will destroy them in a more limited degree than the round. Hence, it would seem that the wound of the conoidal being narrower, containing less of the foreign substance, and being more sharply defined from the surrounding tissues, has a greater tendency to heal. The exception occurs where the bones have been much splintered. The round bullet, on meeting with a hard-resisting substance, such as the compact tissue of the thigh-bone, becomes splintered and altered in shape. The expansion undergone by the Snider bullet and its splintering were so great that it was practically an ex- plosive one. With the Martini-Henry missile, the bullet being composed of lead mixed with tin, the deformity on contact was much less. At the present time every important Power is armed with the magazine rifle. The bullets are smaller, harder, and lighter. In the British Army the Martini-Henry, with its calibre of '450 inch, has been superseded by the Lee-Metford rifle, with a bullet of a calibre of ‘SOS inch (Fig. 44). The following table shows the more im- portant characters of the various bullets used by the European Powers at the present time :— Power. Weight. Calibre. Composition. VelooiUj [Muzzle).

The consideration of the wounds inflicted by it will be considered later, but meanwhile its main characteristics would seem to be—less stopping-power and greater penetration. Fig. 43 shows the shapes of the bullets above named, and includes also the Snider, Needle-gun, Chassepot, and Enfield bullets. Fig. 44 depicts the Lee-Metford bullet.

449 LIPOMATA. matoiis cysts of the ovary and ovarian dermoids rupture, or leak, into the peritoneal cavity. The cells grow upon the peri- toneum and form warts in one case, and small dermoids in the other. Dissemination of epithelial growths in this manner may be spoken of as epithelial infection. In the case of carcinomata and sarcomata epithelial infection of the peritoneum soon induces death. Infection from an ovarian pa- pilloma gives rise to liydro - peritoneupi; but when the prim- ary tumour is re- moved, the warts quickly atrophy. In the same way jiapil- loma of the renal pelvis may infect the bladder; and epithe- lium of the skin or cornea, when acci- dentally buried in the subcutaneous tissue or cornea, will some- times grow into a small tumour (im- plantation cyst). In order to distinguish the infection of the peritoneum by pa- pillomata and der- moids from that due to cancer or sar- coma, it will be use- ful to speak of it as pseudo-maKgnancy. Pig-. 97.—Lipoma of the Palm GROUP I. CONNECTIVE TISSUE TUMOUR,S. This group contains the following genera :—1, Lipomata; 2 chondromata ; 3, osteomata 3 4, odontomata ; 5, fibromata; 6, myxo- mata ; 7, gliomata; 8, neuromata; 9, angeiomata; 10, lymphangeio- mata; 11, myomata; 12, sarcomata. Adrenal tumours and deciduoma are provisionally grouped with the sarcomata. 1. Lipomata (Fatty Tumours). A lipoma is a tumour composed of fat. Lipomata are the com • monest and most widely distributed of all tumours that occur in the human body. The species of this genus, determined mainly by the situations in which they occur, are:—(1) Subcutaneous, p

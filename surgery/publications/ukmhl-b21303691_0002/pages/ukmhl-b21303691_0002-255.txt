Bacteria vary greatly in their re- lation to heat, according to the stage of their existence. Those forms which grow rapidly, more especially the micrococci, are very readily destroyed at comparatively low temperatures ; but those forms which produce spores, if they have already passed into the spore stage, resist heat to an extraordinary degree. Indeed, the spores of bacteria may be exposed to dry heat considerably above the boiling-point of water for hours without losing their vitality; while, on the other hand, the same bacteria in the adult stage will be destroyed by shoit exposure to a very moderate degree of heat, indeed, a thorough and prolonged drying, even without the action of heat, will lead to their death. The same differences are observed between adult bacteria and spores in their relation to various chemical substances. Fortunately, the organisms which for the most part come into play in surgery belong to the non-spore-bearing bacteria, and are thus much more readily killed ; indeed, with the exception of the anthrax bacillus, the tetanus bacillus, the tubercle bacillus, and one or two others, we have essentially to do with cocci, which are very readily destroyed by comparatively dilute chemical substances. The pyo- genic cocci, for example, are destroyed in a few seconds by the action of a 5 per cent, wateiy solution of carbolic acid, and even by a 21 per cent, solution; and they are also destroyed, though perhaps not quite so rapidly, by a 1 in 2,000 solution of bichloride of mercury, and, of course, much more rapidly where the solutions are more concentrated. While this is the case with regard to watery solutions of these antiseptic substances, it is very important to bear in mind that oily solutions are not nearly so active ; in fact 1 to 20 solution of carbolic acid in oil is practically inert as a means of killing bacteria; indeed, a 1 to 5 solution of carbolic oil will not do what a 1 to 20 watery solution will. Apart from the destruction of the vitality of these organisms by antiseptic solutions, we have in the treatment of wounds to remember also that it is sufficient if we prevent their growth, and that very much smaller quantities of carbolic acid, and more especially of corrosive sublimate, will

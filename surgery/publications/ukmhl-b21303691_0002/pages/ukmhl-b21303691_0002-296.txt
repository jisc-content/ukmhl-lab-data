XII. BUENS AND SCALDS. By C. B. LOCKWOOD, F.E.C.S., Assistant-Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's JETospital; Surgeon to the Oreai Northern Hospital. Definitioil.—Burns are the effects of dry heat; scalds are caused by hot liquids, or by steam. The pathological and clinical results are, in any case, so much alike that it is unnecessary to consider them apart. Mortality.—Excessive heat produces the most extensive and serious injuries, and causes a large proportion of the deaths in our great hospitals. In ten years, from 1884 to 1893 inclusive, six hundred and ninety-six cases of burns and scalds were admitted into St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. Of these one hundred and thirty-eight died. Burns are more fatal than scalds. Of four hundred and thirty-four who were burnt, one hundred and fourteen died (26-26 per cent.); and out of two hundred and sixty-two who were scalded, twenty-four died (9-16 per cent.). During infancy both burns and scalds are exceedingly fatal Of the hundred and fom-teen who succumbed to burns, no less than sixty were under the age of five years. Of the twenty-four who died of scalds, no less than nineteen were under five years of age. Within the period which has been taken, no one over sixty years of age died of scalds, although thirteen died of burns. Infants burn and scald themselves by playing with fire, or by upsetting or drinking from boiling kettles; adults are, pei-haps, more often injured by the upsetting of lamps, or the explosion of kitchen boilers. Classification.—Dupuytren’s classiOcation of burns and scalds into degrees, according to their depth, is convenient, and is usually adopted. In the first degree the surface is scorched, with subsequent superficial redness and hypersemia. This erythema is followed by desquamation. No trace of the injury remains beyond a slight discoloration. In the second degree the epidermis is raised from the derma into vesicles or bullae. The ti’ue skin inflames, but is otherwise uninjured,

The exuberant growth in the rectum had so obstructed the lumen of the bowel, that colotomy was urgently needed six weeks before the man died. In addition, the disease had infiltrated the prostate, so that button-like knobs of the tumour obstructed the urethra and caused retention of urine, necessitating the regular use of a catheter. There were no secondary deposits ; death in this case was largely due to the interference with vital organs, in consequence of the infiltrating properties of the tumour. The immediate cause of death was urfemia, and each renal pelvis was dilated and filled wth purulent material. The rapid course of events in this case was due not only to the essential malignancy of the tumour, but also to the implication of the bladder and ureters, and the consequent lena trouble. The progress was assisted by progressive anemia, caused

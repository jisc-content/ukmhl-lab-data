As to rotatory deformity, it must be borne in mind that, when at rest, the thigh is permitted by the ilio-trochanteric band to roll out, until the feet point up and out, and form with the vertical an angle of 45° to 50°. The degree of rotation of the sound limb should be noted, and the injured one should be “set” at the correspond- ing angle. The structure of many splints is such that they are calculated to fix the foot in the vertical position; but no splint will prevent rotation out of the upper fragment un less the hip be flexed. To carry out the above indications we have many methods and splints. (1) Simple horizontal extension.—A long wide strip of stout strapping is carried on each side of the leg and thigh up to the fracture, or even a little above it if the injury is low, so as to form a stirrup 4 to 5 in. long below the sole. Narrow in.) strap- ping coiled obliquely round the limb from below up helps to fix this, as also does a roller firmly applied over all. The stirrup is held open by a “ spanner ” of wood, a little wider than the bi-malleolar measui’e- ment, with a hole through the centre; through this a stout cord is passed and knotted towards the sole, the other end for the weight being passed over the pulley. To diminish friction, the distal portion of the limb may be laid in a Hodgen’s wooden cradle, or some corresponding trough, and the transverse l)ars beneath this Fig. 295.—Treatment of a fractured Tliigli l)y short side Splints and Weiglit Extension between Sandbags.

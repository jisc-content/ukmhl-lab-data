XIV. ANESTHETICS. By FREDERIC W. HEWITT, M.D. Cantab., Ancssthetist to, and Instructor in Ancesthetics at, the London Hospital. For the preveiitlou of pain during surgical operations two recognised inodes of procedure are open to the surgeon. He may either induce and maintain a state of general amesthesia by the administration for example, of nitrous oxide,-ether, or chloroform; or he may brin- about a condition of local anesthesia by the use of such a4nts a1 cocaine, the ether-spray, or chloride of ethyl. Speaking generally, the former plan is applicable and reliable in every case in which a painful operation is contemplated; whilst the latter, in addition to Its havmg but a limited range of applicability, is in many cases distinctly unreliable. I. GENERAL ANESTHESIA. 1. Preparations and precautions. These may be briefly summarised. (1) Putting aside nitrous oxide, for which no very special pre- paration is needed, the bowels should be thoroughly evacuated by appiopiiate means. This is usually best efiected by a purgative the day before, and an enema on the morning of the operation. The bladder, too, should be empty. (2) Whenever practicable, in ordinary surgical practice, an interval of from four to five hours should have elapsed since the last meal. In the case of nitrous oxide, about three hours’ fast is advisable. In exhausted subjects, some clear soup or beef-tea may be allowed three hours before the operation. A little brandy or whisky, with an equal quantity ot water, is permissible fifteen minutes before the operation when signs of faintness are present. (3) The early morning (8 a.m. to 9.30 a.m.) is the best time for ordinary surgical operations. (4) The administrator should on all occasions observe the patient’s colour, respiration, and pulse. Should any marked de- parture from the normdl be detected, a stethoscopic examination should be made.

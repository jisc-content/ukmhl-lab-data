Extension is arrested by the radius being brought up against the back of the humerus. Treatment of the dislocation backwards.â€”Difference of opinion exists regarding the manipulations necessary to reduce this injury. Some authorities advise extension and counter-extension, with direct pressure upon the head of the displaced bone, and this would seem to be generally efficacious. Afterwards, the limb should be put up in the flexed position, or it has been advised tJiat the fore-arm be kept extended, to allow the tense biceps to pull the radius forvvards. Should fracture of the external condyle complicate these injuries, the parts must be carefully padded, and moveinrat Sentleness exerted in the earlier trials of passive Dislocation of the head of the radius outwards.~lt is well to look upon these displacements as really modifications of the forwards or backwards dislocations. Thus the head of the radius mly be thrown outwards and forwards, or outwards and backwards The diagnosis and treatment require no special remarks.

INJURIES OF BONES. 760 animals, this occurs in the neiglibourliood of the fracture, where, presumably, the irritation from movement is somewhat greater than at more remote parts. Cornil and Ranvier state that a clear matrix, not staining with carmine, appears between the round embryonic cells of the callus about the eighth to tenth day; the tissue thus assumes the appearance of embryonic cartilage. From the tenth to Fig. 223.—A transverse Section of Callus upon the compact Wall of a long Bone Below is seen the compact hone ; its Haversian spaces are becoming enlarged, and the line between it and the sub.jacent callus is thus rendered irregular. Tiie ciillus shows many lai^e spaces, containing vessels (not shown), and numerous osteoblasts, in a calcified matrix. No Haversian lainellse, regularly deposited on tlie walls of the cavities, are shown, and the bone cells scattered through the matrix exhibit no regular arrangement. The round-celled infiltration on the surface is pushing between the connective tissue and muscle fibres, and is being invaded on the other hand by bony spicules. (Billroth.) fifteenth calcification and ossification begin, following the physiological plan. The cartilage cells multiply and fill large spaces; these open into one another, giving rise to still larger spaces—primary areolae— the walls of which calcify. Beneath the periosteum, and close to the bone, a layer of vascular medulla remains, and this bursts through at various points into the primary areolae. The cartilage cells disappear before the medullary. Osteoblasts speedily line the cavities, and proceed to lay down bone in the usual way. The periosteal and intermediary callus become cartilaginous, but in

52 8UEGIGAL BAGTEEIOLOGY. not grow on this potato hroth, they may be cultivated in meat bouillon, which must be diluted forty or fifty times before it is used for microscopic examination; or on gelatine plates, the cultivations in this case being diluted about one hundred times. k drop of the diluted fluid is spread on a cover-glass ; on this a drop of 10 per cent, alcohol is allowed to fall, and the whole is dried in the open air or in a wann room, at a temperature of 40” C. The bacilli are then mordanted in a solution made up as follows 20 per cent, tannin solution, ten parts ; cold saturated solution of sulphate of iron, flve parts; aqueous or alcoholic solution of fuchsin, or alcoholic solution of methyl-violet, one part. To tliis mixture add a drop of hydrochloric, acetic, or sulphuric acid (in the case of those bacteria which give an alkaline reaction), or of an alkaUne solution, say, 1 per cent. NaOH (in the case of bacteria which have an acid reaction) • Put a few drops of this mixture on a cover-glass, heat until steam nse^ wash in distilled water, and then in absolute alcohol, until all colour is removed. Repeat the process, and stain in an aniline water or carbolic acid solution of fuchsin, wlu^ has been neutralised by the addition, drop by drop, of a 1 per cent, solution of NaOH, imtil a layer of the previously transparent fluid, several centimetres thick, begins to become opaque. Tliis wiU bring out flagella most beautifully. Success depends on adding just the right quantity of acid or alkali to the mordant.

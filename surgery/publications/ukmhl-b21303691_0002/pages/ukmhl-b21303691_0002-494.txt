450 TUMOURS. (2) subserous, (3) subsyaovial, (4) submucous, (5) intermuscular, (6) intramuscular, (7) periosteal, (8) meningeal. 1. Subcutaneous lipomata. — These occur as irregularly lobulated encapsuled tumours in the subcutaneous fat. Unless they have been irritated or inflamed these tumours are movable within their capsules, but cannot be completely isolated from the overlying skin, which is usually puckered. In most cases one lipoma is present, but two, ten, or more may exist concurrently. In size they vary widely; some give trouble when they do not exceed the dimensions of a ripe cherry, and others weighing ten or twelve pounds are borne by apathetic individuals without complaint. Although this species is mainly confined to the trunk and trunk end of the bmbs, they may arise in the subcutaneous fat in any situation —face, neck, fingers, palms (Fig. 97), soles, or scrotum. When multiple they are often symmetrical so far as situation is concerned. Rarely a lipoma becomes pedunculated, and there is a variety Fig. 98.—Diffuse Lipoma, (After Morrant Baker.) known aS diffuse lipoma, in which the subcutaneous fat in the neck, the axillae, groins and pubic region, becomes excessive and forms unencapsuled masses, as in Fig. 98. 2. Subserous lipomata —The peritoneum, like the skin, rests upon a bed of fat. In this subserous fatty deposit bpomata are prone to occur, and, like those of the subcutaneous species, they may be sessile, pedunculated, or diffuse. When arising in the perirenal fat or in the mesentery, lipomata may attain pro- dimous proportions—fifty or sixty pounds. Exceptionally larp fatty tumours have been encountered between the layers of tlie broad ligament of the uterus, simulating ovarian cysts. Sul>peri- toneal fatty tumours sometimes drag upon the peritoneum in tlie neicrhbourhood of the inguinal and femoral rings, and produce finger- like diverticula of this membrane, which, when surrounded by tat.

531 LTGATUHE OF AN ARTFEY result luay follow too rapid absorp- tion of tho ligature. Wiiile ad- iiiittuig the justice of these objec- tions, they do not appear to out- w(',igh tlie important advantage of safety against haemorrhage, and the balance of evidence is, therefore, decidedly in favour of applying liga- tures to arteries in continuity with- out division of their inner coats. Although this method should be used in all cases, it is of especial value and importance where the ligature has to be a]>plied near a large branch or to a diseased artery. This form of ligature, no doubt, requires greater care than the other method; but this is no argument against its employment. The liga- ture should be one of the less ab- sorbable forms—silk or tendon— Fig. 155.—Tran =iverso Section of the Common CarotiU Artery (x 190), showing the thickness of the three coats.

The outer coat is much thicker than in other large arteries. and, of course, it should be carefully prepared to render it aseptic, and every pains taken to secure primary aseptic healing of the wound. It must be remembered that the arterial walls are much thinner during life when exposed to the normal blood pressure than they are when empty and collapsed after death. The wavy outline of tlie elastic membrane of Henle is en- tirely due to this shrinking of the empty vessel, and is lost when the artery is distended by the blood. Ballance and Edmunds found that the thickness of the common carotid artery of man, when collapsed, is ‘7 8 mm., but when distended with a pressure of 240 mm. of mercury it is reduced to '29 mm.

1004 DISLOCATIONS. Treatment.— Flex the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the pelvis in slight abduction; adduct the thigh until opposite the umbilicus. Fig. 411.—Flexion, Abduction and Rotation inwards in Pubic or Obturator Dislocations. Rotate inwards and extend (Fig. 411). By this means the head of the bone retraces its steps into the aceta- bulum. In some cases of this manipula- tion, too forcible flexion of the thigh may press the displaced head backwards to- wards the sciatic region. Abduction and rotation outwards may then succeed, when the previous manipulation has failed. So, too, flexion of the thigh and lifting the head of the femur outwards and upwards into the acetabulum, combined with rotation inwards and out- wards, have proved successful. While the surgeon is adduct- ing the flexed limb, a powerful assistant may pass a jack- towel round the tliigh, and the pelvis being firmly fixed, he, passing his shoulders through the towel, heaves upwards and outwards, while the surgeon adducts the limb and rotates it in- wards. This dislo- cation has also been reduced by Fig 412.—Position of the Head of the Femur ia Pubic Dislocations.

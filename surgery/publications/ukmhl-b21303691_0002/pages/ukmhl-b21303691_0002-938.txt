DISEASES OF BONES. 896 especially, for tubei'culous dactylitis. In the latter the whole bone is not at first enlarged, and the deposit quickly softens down and ajjproaches the surface. Anti-syphilitic remedies, as a rule, produce an improvement, if not complete resolution, in syphilitic dactylitis, whilst in the tuberculous form such remedies cause no alternation, and the enlargement slowly softens down into caseous debris. HYPERTROPHY AND ATROPHY OF BONE. Hypertrophy.â€”This is a term which should not be applied to an enlarged bone, unless the whole is of normal shape and density. For instance, chronic osteitis may produce an enlarge- ment of bone, and in young subjects may even result in lengthening of the shaft of a long bone ; but if this is only a part of a general osteitis with resulting osteo- sclerosis it should not be called hypertrophy. For the same reason, osteo- porosis, osteitis defor- mans, leontiasis ossea, and acromegaly cannot strictly be cited as hyper- trophy of bone. True hypertrophy of bone from excessive use in an extremely muscu- lar subject is, perhaps, the best instance of this condition. Here the bones generally and the ridges for the attach- ment of muscle are found enlarged. There are some rare cases of congenital hyper- trophy of a whole limb in which the bones of that limb are correspondingly large and lonc^. They may be classed as cases of true hypertrophy of bone. In Elephantiasis of one leg in the young subject the bones are undoubtedly longer than those of its fellow, and appear also to be larger but I know of no evidence to show that the bones in such a case are of normal density. The lymphatic obstruction has led to increased growth, but from the condition of the skin one could not argue that the bone was likely to be of normal consistence.

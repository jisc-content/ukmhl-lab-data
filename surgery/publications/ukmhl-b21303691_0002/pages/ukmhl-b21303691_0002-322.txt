Gaskell and bhore, in another important contribution to the subject, maintain la e enect of chloroform on the vaso-motor centre is rather one factor in the fall of blood pressure, but admit that cardiac depression may contribute, especially when the heart is previously diseased. They disagree with the Hyderabad Commission that the low blood safeguard; and, in conclusion, coiToborate Mac Williams statement that dilatation of the heart’s cavities is invariably produced in deep chloroform anaesthesia. Quite recently, Pickering has shown, by experiments on the heart of the chick embryo—a heart not yet possessing nervous connections with the central nervous system—that chloroform has a distinctly depressino- effect upon the cardiac muscle itself. ° In administering chloroform, attention should be paid to the following points (1) The respiration. This should either be heard or felt throughout. A soft regular snoring is to be encouraged. (2) The pulse. This should be carefully watched, in addition to tlie breathing. (3) The colour. Simple cyanosis points to some inter- ference with respiration, whilst circulation is but little deranged ; it is, hence, common when the air-supply is restricted or when the respiratory movements are inadequate.

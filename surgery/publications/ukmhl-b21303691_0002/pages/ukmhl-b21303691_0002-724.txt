680 INJUlilES AND DISEASES OP LYMPHATICS. lymph from the surface of the tongue, which was often the seat of a painful hut superficial inflammation. Compression by means of isinglass plaster, beneath which are strips of calico .steeped in alum or tannin, has in some instances eflected a cure, but is difiicult of application. The best result is obtained by the removal with scissors of a V-shaped portion from the extremity of the tongue, and uniting the parts thus separated with deep sutures of silver wire or silkworm gut. These .should be removed before suppuration occurs. The bleeding is seldom trouble- some and can be easily restrained by ligatures. iriacvoclieilia, or congenital hypertrophy of the lip, is due to a similar cause. The lip and cheek are greatly enlarged and continue to increase with the growth of the patient. The swelling is firm and is not compressible, but its resemblance to a nsevoid swelling is very intimate in consequence of the veins partaking of the varicose condition which affects the lymphatic tissues. Excision of the whole or of a large portion of the mass is the only remedy and can be performed without much hjemorrhage. {See Art, XLV., on Affec- tions OF THE Mouth, Palate, and Tongue, Vol. II.)

INFLAMMATfON. 58 number of corpuscles in the cornea, which contain cinnabar, is much oi’eater, and this is in accordance with what one would expect, seeing that a larger number of the leucocytes in the blood have had the opportunity of taking up these particles. ^ i i i It havin" been demonstrated in this way that a considerable number, at a°ny rate, of the cells which appear in the inflamed area during the early stage of inflammation, are actual leucocytes which have passed out of the blood-vessels, Oohnheim was the hrst to observe the actual migration of these corpuscles. This is done by spreading out the mesentery of a frog on a glass plate. As the result of the action of the air, it will be found that the early stages of inflammation are set up in the exposed part of the mesentery, and we have the various phenomena of dilatation of the vessels, and slow- ing of the blood current, which have been already mentioned. Now if, while the circulation is becoming slow, a small vein be carefully watched, it will be found that two currents can be distin- guished in the vessel— a central current contain- ing the red blood cor- puscles, and a marginal current, in which are the white blood corpuscles. If these white corpuscles be watched, it will be found that they pass along much more slowly than the red, tend to stick to the walls of the vessels and to each other, and ultimately feme to a standstUl altogether, and thus the blood-vessel may after a time be seen to be lined with a la}er of '°“7tra\p2men be left for some hours, it will be seen on examining it aeain thS not only is there a layer of white corpuscles .aside the lr±i^:Soro?thtr?S Vii?

At one part the muscular fibres are being destroyed, and granulation tissue is being formed.

This must be borne in mind, or an incorrec opinion will be formed as to the nature of the tumour. The following facts will afford some idea as to the degree of variation in size of the cells of spindle- celled sarcomata. In some of the tumours the cells are so thin, slender, and contain so little protoplasm that they seem to consist only of a nucleus and cell pro- cesses. It is difficult to distinguish such cells from those of inoderately-firm fibrous tissue. In other specimens the cells are large, beautifully fusiform, and rich in protc plasm. They give rise to considerable . j. j. difficulty to the morbid anatomist, and he often feels incompetent to decide between such cells and those of young unstriped muse e- 6bre. The complexity of such tumours is further increased by the fact that occasionally these long spindle-cells are transversely striated like voluntary muscle-fibre. This variety is sometimes called myo- sarcoma (Fig. 114). , . .1 £ 4- Another peculiarity of spindle-celled sarcomata is the frequent presence of tracts of immature hyaline cartilage; in some instances this tissue constitutes so large a proportion of these tumours that they are described as cliondromata; the cartilage is sometimes calcified and even ossified. When cartilage is very abundant in a sarcoma it is termed a chondrosarcoma. In slow-growing examples of this species the spindle-cells become converted into fibrous tissue; such are often called fibrosarcomata. Spindle-celled sarcomata often contain round cells and even large multinuclear cells. Pis 114.—Cells from a Spindle-celled Sarcoma of the Neck of the Uterus. Some of the cells have a cross-striation.

472 TUMOURS. Infiltrating proi^erties. — In -some instances sarcomata are furnished—at least, in their early stages—with a capsule, but the majority are unencapsuled, and extensively infiltrate the planes of connective tissue adjacent to the tumour. This infiltrating tendency comes out well when a sarcoma starts within the sheath of a muscle, for it will dissociate the fasciculi and extend throughout the muscle, transforming it into a hard indurated mass. Retinal sarcomata, after escaping from the eyeball, infiltrate the ocu- lar muscles, and periosteal sarcomata infiltrate the adjacent muscles, and render it impossible to determine tlie real limits of the tumours, especially when seated in the limbs. Lympho-sarcomata, aris- ing in the mediastinum, illustrate the disastrous effects of infiltration (Fig. 116). Dissemination. — Sar- comata are liable to re- produce themselves in distant parts. The most usual organ in which to find secondary deposits is the lung (Fig. 117), unless the primary tumour is situated in the territory of the portal circulation, then they will be found in the liver. In very malignant sarco- mata, especially the round- ceUed species, secondary deposits may form in every organ of the body. They are always identi- cal in structure with the primary tumour. The relation to veins.—It has long been recognised that when sarcomata disseminate, the situations of secondary nodules indicate that the distribution has been effected by means of veins. The venules issuing from a sarcoma wdl often be found plugged by small outrunners from the tumour, and occasionally, when a large sarcoma of the pelvic bones implicates the iliac veins, portions of the tumour will travel along the lumen of the vein, and even extend into the Fig. 117.—Section of Lung, with Nouules of Sarcoma secondary to spindle-oelled Tumour of the Testis.

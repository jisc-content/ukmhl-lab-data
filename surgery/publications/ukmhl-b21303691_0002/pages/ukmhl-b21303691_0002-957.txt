915 TUMOURS OF BONE. approaches tlie surface by destruction and ppansion of the bone within which it grows. The periosteum, irritated by its presence, produces new bone, so that a complete shell or plates of bone are always found upon its surface. This is the chief distinguishing feature, both in the clinical and naked-eye examination of the central sarcoma of bone. {See Figs. 355, 356.) .The malignancy of sarcomata of hone is shown by the tendency they e.xhibit towards local recurrence after removal, by the frequent occurrence of deposits of the same growth in distant organs, especially Fig. 365.—Giant-celled Sarcoma of tlie upper End Fig. 356.—Tlie outer Half of preceding Speci' of a Tibia removed by Amputation from a men macerated, and showing imperfect man, aged 35, under the writer's care.

The usual method of dissemination is by the veins; hence the frequency with which the lungs are invaded. On the other hand, the lymphatics are very rarely involved ; and when they are so, it is generally on account of the position of the primary growth. In a pelvic sarcoma the glands may be very early invaded by the simple and direct extension of the growth without travelling along lymphatic vessels. But having once gained access to a lymphatic gland, it may be distributed further from gland to gland by lymphatic vessels. The sarcomata of bone differ very much in the degree of malig- nancy they present. Some invariably retiu’n locally, or appear else- where, no matter how early in the course of the disease or how far removed from the seat of the tumour the operation is performed.

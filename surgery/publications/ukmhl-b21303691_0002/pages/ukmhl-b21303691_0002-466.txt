422 SYPHILIS. ecthymatoiis or bullous syphilide. The syphilitic erythematous and lichenoid eruption just mentioned—the most frequent early sign of congenital syphilis —especially afiects those parts which are so commonly the site of eczema inter- trigo and of lichen- eczema in infants ; hence much diffi- culty in diagnosis. The more copper- coloured the spots, and the more marked the infiltra- tion of the skin, the srreater are the chances of the erup- tion being due to syphilis. Large smooth-topped shiny papules of a reddish- brown colour on the buttocks, scrotum, etc., are very cha- racteristic of the disease. Round the anus, at the inguinal folds, round the mouth, and else- where, if the papules are kept moist, condylomata are very apt to develop (Fig. 88). We may see the mouth com- pletely encircled by well-defined condy- lomata or mucous patches, and the healing of these, or of syphilitic fissures, may leave a per- manent witness to syphilis in the form of fine scars, which radiate from the mouth across the lips, and especially from the commissures. A word of warning must be given against taking these radiating scars in later years as conclusive, tor severe eczema with fissures in unhealthy infants may occasionally y;,, 88 —Condylomata on tlie Scrotum and around the Anus, '’’witli superficial Ulceration of the Buttock.

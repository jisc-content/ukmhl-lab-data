When the disease is too extensive for local treatment, amputation is the oiffy resouice, and great care must then be taken to ensure the complete avoidance of affected tissue, as recurrences have been observed m cicatrices after removal of a limb. The use of the sharp spoon may be indicated in some cases, and whenever local operations are performed a strong solution of carbobc acid shoiffd be applied, to obviate as far as possible the possibility of re-infection of the fresh surface.

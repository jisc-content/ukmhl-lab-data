GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 953 torn or stretched; the neighbouring vessels and nerves may be pressed upon, contused or actually torn. Gangrene or diffuse aneurysm may even supervene. Much blood is extravasated about the articulation and in the substance of the contused and torn muscles. Fractures may co-exist, and when the ligaments are very strong—as tlie liga- mentum teres—a portion of bone is often torn away rather than that the ligiuiients themselves should yield. Grave cerebral, thoracic or abdominal injuries are sometimes found associated with dislocations. An evident displacement of the hip, for instance, may readily draw away the surgeon’s attention from graver or more fatal co-existent lesions m other parts.

Oenei-al pathology of uiii'ccluced ti'aiiiuutic disloca- tions.—When a dislocation remains unreduced, the inflammation of the muscles and peri-articular structures speedily terminates in ejmdation and organisation, so that the muscles become structurally shortened, and incapable of relaxation after ansesthesia. The new adhesions fix the bone to its fresh surroundings, enclosing it in a kind of spurious capsule, and the old articular cavity becomes filled with fibrous deposit, and subsequently is rendered shallow and well-nigh obliterated. The displaced head of the bone, by pressui-e absorption, soon works for itself a cavity in the bone upon which it rests and moves, and becomes itself altered in shape, and smooth and por- cellanous on the surface (Fig. 372). The main vessels and nerves may be glued to the displaced bone or fragments of capsule by fimi fibrous adhesions. This is a matter of vital importance in the instance of old dislocations of the shoulder.

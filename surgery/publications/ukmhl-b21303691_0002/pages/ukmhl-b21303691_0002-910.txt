INJURIES OF BONES. 868 astragalus on the malleolus, and recognised by swelling, tenderness, and pain—the latter increased by pressing the fibula high up towards the tibia—and perhaps slight mobility and crepitus in moving the foot. (2) Next comes Polt^s fracture (Figs. 325, 326, 329), due to greater but similar violence. The fibula is broken 3 inches up, the internal malleolus is torn off) or the internal lateral ligament of the ankle is torn through. The foot is markedly everted, and often carried backwards as well; there is a hollow over the fracture of the fibula. Fig. 324.—Salter s Cradle. soon obliterated by haemorr- hage ; the internal malleolus or its sharp stump presses strongly against the skin, and not infrequently cuts its way through. {See also page 1018,) (3) Rarely the fibula, in breaking as above, carries with it the fibular margin of the tibial articular surface and a fragment of bone, to which more or less of the interos- seous ligament is attached; the external malleolus can now swing out away from the internal malleolus, leaving a gap 825 and 326.—From Photographs of a recent case of Fracture of toe ® ind of toe Fibula 2 to 8 inches up; with displacement backwrds and outuards of the foot.

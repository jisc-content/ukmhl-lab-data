399 SECONDARY SYPHILIS. erosions and mucous patches are extremely apt to occur on the tonsils and adjoining part of the soft palate or pillars of the fauces. In exceptionally severe cases the ulceration may be deep, and lead to much deformity of the pharynx by contraction ; but in the early sta<^e of secondary syphilis the most frequent lesion is a greyish- white sinuous, often rounded, patch on each tonsil, accompanied by more or less swelling of the lymphatic glands at the angles of the jaw. In other cases the tonsils are simply hypertro- phied and, with the rest of the mucous membrane of the throat, con- gested, but not ulcerated. Bald, congested areas on the tongue are sometimes seen, the epithelial covering of the papillae being here shed in great part, and these rounded denudation patches are very characteristic of syphilis, though they also occur in the rare disease known as “ wan- dering rash of the Fig. 81.—Syphilitic Eruption on the Tongue *n the early i. !) Secondary Period, showing mauy mucous patches and tongue (usually some ulcers and fissures. met with in young children). As to the severity of the secondary affections of the mouth and throat, a good deal will depend on the patient’s habits and the treatment employed. If he neglect all measures of oral hygiene, continue to smoke and to drink spirits and beer, or if mercury be given injudiciously so as to cause salivation, the ulcers and raucou.s patches will probably be extensive, slow to heal, and very liable to relapse. Sometimes, however, grave ulceration of the mouth and throat during the secondary stage may occur apart from any want of care in treatment or on the patient’s part, and may prove ex- tremely refractory. The base of the tongue, the epiglottis, and the laryngeal orifice may be affected with mucous patches, persistent

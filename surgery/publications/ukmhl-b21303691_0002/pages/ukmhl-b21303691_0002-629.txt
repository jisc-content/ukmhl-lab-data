If it occurs as the direct result of an injury to the vessel wall, which severs all the coats more or less completely, it is called a traumatic aneurysm j but when as the result of disease having im- paired its resiliency and strength, the arterial wall permanently yields under the pressure of the blood, it is called an idiopathic or spontaneous a/neurysm. These two great classes of aneurysm differ not only in their mode of origin, but to some extent in their nature and in their indications for treatment, and they must therefore be dealt with separately. An abnormal communication between an artery and a vein is known as an arterio-venous aneurysm; this may be either traumatic or idiopathic in origin, and its features are so peculiar that it is placed in a separate class. Cirsoid aneurysm is an arterial angeioma, and is described on page 577 under that heading; it has no pathological affinities with the other forms of aneurysm. I. IDIOPATHIC OR SPONTANEOUS ANEURYSM. .Etiology.â€”A spontaireous or pathological aneui'ysm is formed when an artery permanently yields under the pressure of the

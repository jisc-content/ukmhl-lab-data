TUMOURS ‘182 removal will demand a very extensive, difficult, and frequently a dangerous operation, and often is an impossible task. It is difficult to formulate rules for the operative treatment of epithelioma and to decide what is, and what is not, justifiable surgery. Every surgeon must be guided by individual experience. It is exceedingly difficult to express collectively the effects of opera- tion in eradicating this disease. The facts broadly stated stand thus:— In a small proportion of cases the operation is of doubtful utility, and in a few instances life is sacrificed in • .. • . consequence of the interference. On the other hand, a large number of patients rive the greatest comfort, and their lives certainly prolonged. In a small number of ms mm 'fm '■ instances an actual cure is brought about. When an epithelioma is removed and there is no recurrence for five years, the individual may be re- garded as cured. It will be useful to rei- terate here that of the three cUnical varieties of epith elioma rig. 126.—Microscopical Characters of an Ovarian Adenoma. the burrowing form is not only the most malignant, but gives the worst results after operation. The warty variety is not only the least malignant, but affords the best results when excised. It may be regarded as an axiom that in cases where operations are performed for epithelioma, and, as far as could be judged, the incisions were carried wide of the diseased tissues, a quick recurrence of the disease, either in or near the cicatrix, or the subsequent enlargement of the lymph glands, may be taken as an indication of a high degree of malignancy, and, as a rule, the uselessness of further operative interference. The tumoiu'S often classed as columnar epithelioma, which are so common in the intestine, especially the colon, are carcinomata, and arise in, and exliibit, the structure of intestinal glands.

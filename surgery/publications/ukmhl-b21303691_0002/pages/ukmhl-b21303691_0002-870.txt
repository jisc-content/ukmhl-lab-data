INJURIES OF BONES. 828 enough up the arm to prevent its displacement. When swelling has ceased an ordinary plaster bandage may be safely used to main- tain this position, care being taken not to draw the bones to- gether : but it prevents massage. Fracture of the lower end of the radius (Colles’s fracture). —In this injury a fracture starts on the anterior surface of the radius ^ to 1 in. above the joint surface, and runs transversely backwards, Fig. 2(54.

(University College Sluseum, No. 211.) or obliquely up and back. The lower fragment is either displaced directly backwards, or it turns up and back as upon a hinge; usually it is displaced outwards (to the radial side) also, and, rotating in this direction, the styloid process is raised. The posterior wall of the upper fragment not uncommonly penetrates the lower fragment, often splitting it into several pieces; or, a<rain, becoming impacted with extraordinary firmness. _ The carpus rnoves outwards with the lower fragment, and sometimes carries the ulnar styloid process with it. The lower end of the ulna may be broken. Further violence may rupture the radio-ulnar

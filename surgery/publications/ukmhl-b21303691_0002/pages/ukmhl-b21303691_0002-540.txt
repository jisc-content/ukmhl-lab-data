XXIII. INJUUIES OE BLOOD-VESSELS. By a. PEARCE GOULD, M.S. Lond., E.R.O.S., Senior Assistant_Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital. In this Article will be considered the various points connected with the injuries of blood-vessels and their repair, and also the questions connected with the most constant and important result of these inj uries—h aemorrh age. I. INJUUIES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. Injuries of arteries may be caused by any kind of contusion, laceration, or wound; but as the effects of the various fonns of injury differ in important particulars, they must be considered separately. 1. Contusion and subcutaneous rupture of arteries.—Contusions areoften subcutaneous injuries. They are produced by blows, severe crushes of a part, stabs with blunt weapons, and bullets travelling at a low rate of velocity. As the contusing force varies in intensity within wide limits, the effects produced upon an artery are very diverse. In the slightest cases there is no obvious lesion of the vessel, although examination with the microscope may reveal minute tears in the muscular coat. The chief effect of this slight injury is to lead to proliferation of the endo- thelium. This is followed by coagulation of the blood within the vessel (thrombosis) and Fig. 132.—Contusion of permanent obliteration, tov^olinner cOTte and A more Severe contusion tears across more completely the two inner coats of the A, Curled up ends of inner vessel, the tough and clastic outer coat remain- - coats. ing intact (Fig. 132). On the uneven surface of the outer coat and the curled-up ends of the inner coats the blood usually quickly coagulates, and the vessel is occluded. But the force of the circulation may produce two otlier effects; it may over-distend

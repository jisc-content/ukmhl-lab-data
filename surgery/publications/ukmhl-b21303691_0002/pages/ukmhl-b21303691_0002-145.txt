In certain cases wliere abscesses have been opened, the wound is a long time in healing, or refuses to close altogether, a small open- ing being left which leads into the deeper tissues. Where this opening ends in the depths of the tissues, it is spoken of as a sinus; or where, being in the skin, it leads to an opening in a mucous Fig. 19.—Tubercular Sinuses and Ulcers in connection with Disease of the Hip and Wiist Joints. The dotted line, extending from the probe, indicates the extent to which the skin is undermined around the opening of the sinus. membrane, it is spoken of as a fistula. Sinus and fistula may also occur in operation wounds, but as I have said, they are much more commonly the result of a previous abscess. Causes of sinus.—There are various reasons why these sinuses may not heal. One of the common causes of non-healing is the presence at the bottom of the sinus of a foreign body, more especially of a piece of dead bone. In such a case, suppuration is kept up around the foreign body, and the pus must find a channel for escape, and therefore keeps the sinus open. Indeed, if the orifice of the sinus be not suflSciently large, pus accumulates in the deeper parts, and presently finds its way to the surface else- where, leading to the formation o|-a. fresh abscess, and subsequently

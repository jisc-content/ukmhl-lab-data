INJURIES OF BONES. 854 less cumbersome way and with many advantages in Hodfjen’a splint shown in Fig. 301. The limb with extension stirrup and spanner attached is laid between the bars, and the cord is tied to the bottom of the splint so that the upper ends may lie comfortably below the anterior spine and groin. A few strips of flannel are passed behind the limb and fastened tautly with pins to the bar on each side. The slings are now fixed to the frame, and by drawing down the wooden stop on the cord the limb is slightly raised (Fig. 302). The ten.sion necessary in each band can now be perceived, and they are rapidly put on so as to overlap well and form a firm cradle. By altering the tension of certain bands and changing the angle of traction, the lower fragment is Fig. 302.—Hoflgen’s Splint applied. Tlie splint used has a second bar to adapt it to Bloxam’s cradle. The bandage round the limb only secures the extension stirrup, wliich is tied to the end of tlie splint. The limb is comfortably slung between the bars by the strips of bandage. The extension pole is shown, passing the foot of the bed, which is raised; the extension cords, from the splint, are attached to the pole high up. raised to the upper, any prominence of wliich should disappear. When there is no angular deformity the two fragments rise together. Counter extension is obtained by the body-weight, the foot of the bed being raised. Excessive rotation out of the leg is opposed by the extension stirrup, friction of the flannel bands against the limbs, and slight flexion at the knee. In this splint the limb swings comfortably; fractures with and without angular deformity can be equally well treated in it, even the supra- condyloid fracture with flexion of this fragment, if it be possible to overcome the deformity by splint only; the nursing is easy, for the patient soon learns to lift himself by his sound leg and arms up and awav from the extension cord, or he can be lifted in this way, so as

967 mSLOGATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. As in tlie case of the hip, sub-varieties of these displacements have been described by anatomists, which rather tend to confuse the student tlian to serve any useful purpose. There is no doubt that the causes which produce these injuries being diverse, and the nature, extent, and application of the forces at work composite, slight differences in position of the head of the bone will be found in different cases. For the same reasons, the amount of laceration of the soft parts in each displacement is not constant, and the obstacles to reduction may slightly vary. It follows that differ- ences may be appreciated in the symptoms of any one given Fig. 879.—Dislocation of the Humerus beneath the Coracoid Process. C-^fter Anger.) dislocation of the humerus, and that methods of reduction applicable to one case of a given dislocation, are not necessai-ily applicable to anotlier. 1. Sul)cora,coid dislocation of tUe Immerus. Causation. Direct violence applied to the shoulder, as a heavy fall or blow j a fall upon the elbow or hand, when the limb is abducted from^ the body ; muscular action. Moihid anatomy.—The head of the humerus is thrown forwards and very slightly do^vnwards, resting upon the anterior surface of the neck of the scapula, while the anatomical neck impinges upon the anterior edge of the glenoid fossa (Fig. 379). So long as the head of the humerus lies beneath the coracoid process in an^ part, the term subcoracoid may be applied to the displacement. The subscapularis muscle may be torn, or stretched across the joint or the liumerus, which, however, is usually markedly above It. the supraspmatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles are

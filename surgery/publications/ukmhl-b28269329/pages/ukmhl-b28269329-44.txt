acute rheumatism, I had made considerable progress in this inquiry, I found the subject too melan- choly, and could not assume resolution to proceed in this investigation. Among many other subjefts of these researches, I had endeavoured to discover the cause of Phthisis in 77 of these patients. Only one single patient had Scrophula. But, in 28 instances, it was ascribed to catching cold. It may be observed that Scrophula must be known whenever it exists, or has exist- ed, from its tangible and visible tumours and ugly scars ; and from the bad cha- racter it has obtained in the world. But, on the other hand, Phthisis is very often occasioned by catching cold in so secret a manner as not to be known nor even sus- pected by the patients themselves. It is true that there is some similitude between the appearance of tubercles in the lungs in Phthisis, and of the inflamed lymphatick glands of the neck in Scro- phula.

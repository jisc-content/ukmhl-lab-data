OR RHEUMATICK FEVER. 133 such extensive experience, and medical knowledge, deserves particular attention. It proves the value of an inquiry which attempts to discover a safe and certain remedy for such a malady. Another circumstance merits great at- tention. After the Rheumatick Fever has been treated by bleeding, leeches, sudorificks, &c. it is well known that pains of the diseased joints and muscles often afHi6t the patient for many months or even years. In my clinical reports I find no instance of this kind, and have reason to think that the Bark entirely prevents this cause of the chronick Rheumatism as a consequence of the inflammatory Fever. Except Mercury in the Syphilis, and Cinchona in the Ague, there are few examples where a remedy can produce such speedy relief and perfect recovery in so formidable a disease. ยง. XXX.

ACUTE RHEUMATISM, 140 Tuesday, (the 3d day inclusive) and was admitted into the Infirmary next day, Wednesday. This and all other British Infirmaries are under the direction of very skilful Physicians. She was in each Fever blooded, blistered, sweated, &c. Her Physicians were very attentive to her case. They generally altered her medicines at each visit. Hence it is manifest that she had the benefit of the best remedies then known. On the whole, the last appears to be a very extraordinary example. The re- covery was much more speedy and perfect than I ever before witnessed. It far ex- i ceeded my expectations founded upon the experience of the efficacy of this mode of treatment in other instances of the Rheumatick Fever. Indeed a physician has seldom an opportunity to order reme- dies at the commencement of this disease. 1

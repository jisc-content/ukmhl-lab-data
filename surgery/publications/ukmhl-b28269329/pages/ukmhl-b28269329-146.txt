ACUTE RHEUMATISM, 13G In the afternoon vomited very fre- quently; had 4 stools in the evening. Profuse sweats. Felt herself very weak and low. At bed time took 20 drops of Laudanum. 5th day. Began at 7 a. m. to take a scruple of Cinchona. Four such doses were taken to-day. As her tongue was covered with a thick yellow fur, the Cinchona was given with the Carbonate of Potash and Lemon Juice in an efferves- cing state; which was extremely palatable and refreshing. Laudanum at night. 6th day. Had a good night, but not much sleep. This morning she can move one leg. During the 3d, 4th, and 5th days, she could not stir a single limb. Took 5 scruples of Cinchona with the effervescing additions. In the evening much better. 7th day. Has pain of her stomach, which seems to proceed from flatulence. For

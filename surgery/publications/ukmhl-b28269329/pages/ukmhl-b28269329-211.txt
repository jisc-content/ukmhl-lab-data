NODOSITY OF THE JOINTS. would give satisfaction either to the reader or myself. XVI. There is one distressful circum- stance which distinguishes this disease. It has no intermission, and but slight remis- sions. For during the remainder of the patientâ€™s life, the Nodes gradually enlarge, impeding more and more the motion of the limb. The malady spreads to other joints, without leaving or producing even any alleviation in those which had been previously attacked. In one case, I find that the fingers, wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, shoulders, neck, and hips, were all affected with this disease at the same time, that is thirteen joints, exclusive of the numerous joints of the hands. If each individual joint of the hands had been taken into the account, they would have amounted to above three times the number, perhaps not fewer than 40.

ACUTE RHEUMATISM, 146 III. Extract “ Physicians upon the subject. With regard “ to myself, it had been my usual practice ci at St. George’s, and I have generally “ pursued it since, to give Antimonial “ medicines for the first few days, and Ci then to have recourse to the Bark. I “ believe I learnt this from my Father; “ and I know he told me that the ad- “ ministration of Bark in Acute Rheu- “ matism had been generally adopted “ by Sir E» Hulse, and with very good <£ success. Upon the publication of your 66 first edition the subject was of course talked of among Physicians in London; “ and I know it appeared to be the “ established practice of many of them.” \ y

ACUTE RHEUMATISM, This patient seems not to have been bled from the arm; probably because, though a young man, his strength had been exhausted by drunkenness ; his state of extreme debility being denoted by a trembling tongue, hands, &c. and by the yellow fur on his tongue; and because the inflammation had receded from the joints. The Rheumatism was compli- cated with Phrenitis, Miliaria, Diarrhoea, and Gastrodynia. No Bark was given in this fatal case; the stomach and bowels were so much disordered, that it seemed improbable such a medicine would agree with them. No sweat was observed on the second day; but though no farther notice is taken of this ordinary symptom, yet we must not conclude that it did not appear, especially as it is the usual con- comitant or cause of miliary eruptions. 8. ft Mrs.

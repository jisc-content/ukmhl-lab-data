OR RHEUMATICK FEVER. 113 I The The 3d Case* in tyhich the Bark was given with less than usual advantage was a patient who had been afflicted with this disease before I saw him, for five months. The swellings of the joints were gone, but much pain and stiffness remained in them: The warm Bath, pumping, and leeches, were ordered; and afterwards the Bark. When this medicine had been taken without ad- vantage for a week, it was omitted. Bathing and antimonials were ordered; and afterwards blood was let, which ap- peared inflamed. From these remedies he found relief, in about a week ; when Bark was again administered till his health was restored. In this case bleeding and Antimony were of manifest service, and the Bark succeeded better after these evacuations. * No. 168.

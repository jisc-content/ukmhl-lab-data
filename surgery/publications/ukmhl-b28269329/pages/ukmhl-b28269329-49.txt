But, till this very difficult and desirable point shall be accomplished, it will be of considerable advantage with as much accuracy as possible to deter- mine what are some of the laws by which this great enemy attacks mankind. For some years I have colledted fadts as opportunity offered, to ascertain what length of time elapses between exposure to coldness and the first symptoms of disease.

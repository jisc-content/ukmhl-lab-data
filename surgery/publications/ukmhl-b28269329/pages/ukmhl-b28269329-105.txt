. OR RHEUMAT1CK FEVER. 9i 8. “ Mrs.K—, (No. 81.) aged 29. Feb. 1. A fortnight after a tedious labour, and on the fifth day of a Rheumatick Fever, but on the third day after the Rheuma- tick swellings had receded from the joints, was my only visit to this patient, who resided twelve miles from Chester. Ever since her delivery she has heard a noise like bells, with head-ach. Her Lochia were profuse for a short time, and foetid. She had wandering rheumatick pains before and ever since her lying-in. Sweats. P. 96—86. No sleep but from opium. Pain and lameness of her right hip ever since her delivery. A copious sediment in her urine. Her wrists were swelled two days ago. Wandering words in her dreams. Leeches to her temples. Pulv. Jac. ant. gr. iij. cum Haust. salin. 6,iJ horis. ad movendum sudor cm, vomitum vel dejee- tionem;. Dein Haust. Dec. Peruv. %ifs Pulv.

In so young a man, a rheumatick Fever occasioned so mani- festly from having caught cold might probably have received more speedy re- lief by taking more blood, and sooner by the lancet. However as the 2d rheuma- tick fever was longer than the 1st in the proportion of 6 to 2, there was reason to apprehend that the 3d attack might have been of longer duration than it proved to be. His recovery from the first relapse was very imperfect; he had rheumatick pains which continued all the summer. It is not reported how perfect was his recovery after taking the Bark, which was again ordered when he was in a convalescent state.

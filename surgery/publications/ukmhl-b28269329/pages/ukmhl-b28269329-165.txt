OR RHEUMATICK FEVER. VIII. Extract of a Letter from John A ikin, M. D. “ April 3d, 1811. i “ THIS reminds me of your re- \ 1' - 66 quest respecting the Rheumatick case. “ 1 am sorry that I have no documents “ for any thing more specific, than that '* the patient was an athletic man, in the “ prime of life, who was suffering very “ severely under rheumatick pains affect- “ ing various parts successively ; that the “ antiphlogistic method had been freely “ tried with no advantage; and that on “ being called in, I immediately, con- “ fiding in your experience, threw in “ the Bark liberally with little other “ medicine; though the Pulse was still “ quick, and heat considerable; and that “ a rapid recovery was the consequence. “ My Son Charles tells me he has had a “ case nearly of the same kind.”

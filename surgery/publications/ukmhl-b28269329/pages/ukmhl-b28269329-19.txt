PREFACE. must not always imply their absence. Considering the urgency of medical du- ties, the experienced practitioner will rather be surprised that so many circum- stances are expressed, than that some are omitted. The seasons and the sexes are always mentioned. A full account of the reme- dies is commonly given. The antece- dent duration of the disease is generally, the age of the patient, the effeCt of the remedies, and the termination of the disease, are frequently, noted. The comparative recurrence of symp- toms, though not fully, will be impar- tially exhibited. The important but difficult inquiry, what is the relative efficacy of medicines, will claim great attention. The inductions from the faCts which have fallen under my observation, cannot always be conclusive, but they shall always be proposed with truth and candour.

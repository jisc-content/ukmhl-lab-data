acute rheumatism, tillly explained in the 1st table.* Hence It appears that the powder was given in 79 cases, the Decoction in 43, the Infu- sion in 12, and theTindture in 19. The dose of the Powder varied from 5 to 60 grains, and the repetition of this quantity Irom once in 2 to once in 12 hours. But the most common dose was from 10 to 30 grains, and the usual time of repeat- ing it was from every 3 to 8 hours. The Decoction of Bark was given from the dose of an ounce to an ounce and a half, up to two ounces every 2, 4, 6, or 8 hours. The Tincture of Bark was ordered in 19 cases, but I believe never till both the Fever and inflammation were gone or much abated. In several cases, the form in which this medicine vvas administered is not noted. * See Tabxe J. Column xxvii. From

ACUTE RHEUMATISM, The 114- The reason why these antiphlogistick remedies were delayed appears to have been, because the patient had been extremely debilitated and emaciated by a tedious disease. On this account, leeches only were at first directed, till a fresh accession of Fever required blood to be taken from the arm. Even in this case, though the Bark was taken with less benefit than usual, yet there is no reason to suspedt that it. did harm even when first exhibited, and after the eva- cuations it was of manifest service. The patient was in a convalescent state in 23 days, though he had been very ill for 5 months previous to my first visit. The cases in which I have found the Bark to produce the most salutary effects were in the inflammatory state of the rheumatick Fever: but in this patient the swelling of the joints had previously subsided.

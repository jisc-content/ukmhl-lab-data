ACUTE RHEUMATISM, far the observation is confirmed by my own experience. But out of 170 cases, I have found 12 which had a fatal termi- nation, either by a translation of the in- flammation to the brain, lungs, kidneys, stomach, or some other vital part, or as being found in combination with other diseases. The following Fatal Cases are copied faithfully from my clinical book, with a few omissions of circumstances of less importance. It was my intention to pub- lish the original words ; which, though generally written in haste, with brevity, and in very anxious situations, yet to myself record the fa<5ts with perspicuity and accuracy. However, they may not appear perspicuous to all readers; and mindful of that excellent admonition of Horace, “ Dum brevis esse laboro obscurus “ Jio” I have thought it might be better to print an English description of the symptoms.

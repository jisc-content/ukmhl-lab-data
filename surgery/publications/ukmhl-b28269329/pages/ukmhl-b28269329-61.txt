OR RHEUMATICK FEVER. the Gout, may be one cause of this co- pious sediment. More of the aqueous and perhaps of some other part of the urine being thus discharged, a larger and probably a different portion of the con- tents may remain undissolved. Chemists have discovered that this red sediment contains the uric acid. If this science could supply an accurate test to discriminate with certainty be- tween Gout, Rheumatism, and Ague, especially the two former, it would be highly valuable: for cases sometimes occur of so doubtful a nature, that a physician cannot always positively de- termine to which disease they belong. This distindtion is very important for the safe treatment and recovery of the pa- tient. Chemistry promises to discover such a decisive test, considering the won- derful ingenuity and zeal with which this useful science is at present prosecuted. e 2 The

CLINICAL HISTORY, &C. 202 40. The malady had been constantly ad* vancing for ten years. These Nodes, in their gradual progress, sadly embitter the comforts of life ; but I know no instance in ' hich they seemed to shorten its du- ration. The first patient whom I saw in this disease lived to about 93 years of age. This faithful picture drawn from nature is here exhibited to excite the compas- sion and exertion of my professional brethren to prevent, if possible, so dis- tressful a malady at its commencement. . As the Nodes at first produce but little pain or inconvenience, and are seldom or never dangerous, they rarely excite the notice which they deserve, and would obtain, if the patients were fully aware that this insidious disorder would con- tinue for life, and would make every future day more uncomfortable.

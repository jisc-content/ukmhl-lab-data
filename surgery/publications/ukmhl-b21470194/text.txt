AND H. CLARK, EDINnUBOTl.PREFACE. The great advance •wliich lias taken place in all tlie departments of medical science renders almost any one of tliem a sufficiently extensive field of study for an ordinary degree of intelligence. But some teachers, seem- ing to forget tliat their pupils are not to be mere anato- mists, chemists, physiologists, or botanists, endeavoiK to inculcate all the knowledge which they possess with regard to their respective subjects of tuition. Profes- sional education thus becomes an efibrt of memory rather than a process of mental training—so that brilliant exa- minations may be passed without any real practical information having- been acquired. The Medical Council lately called attention to the evils which proceed from this system of over-teaching, and especially to its leaving no time for observation or reflection. It is, therefore, to be hoped that a distinction may be drawn between the cultivation and teaching of medical science; and that while the former, in all its details, is carried to the ut- most extent of human ability, the latter will be confined to what is requisite for the instruction of students. Thevi PKEFACE. following work will, it is hoped, be found consistent witli these views. It was the text-book of my systematic course, and contains the principles which I have endea- voured to illustrate in my clinical lectures during the last thirty-four years. In its composition my aim has not been to collect all that might be said in regard to each subject, but rather to select what seemed of most im- portance, and ar¥^ge it in a convenient order for teach- ing or study, so as to constitute a framework of surgical science, which might be filled up through the gTadual acquisition of professional knowledge.CONTENTS. —♦— CHAPTEE I. °" INFLAMMATION.

INFLAMMATION. INTRODUCTION. With exception of the cuticle and its a^Dpendages, the nails and hairs, all the solid part of the human body is composed of vas- cular tissues, which consist of blood-vessels and nerves interwoven together through a basis of cellular substance. These tissues are everywhere permeated by the blood, which supplies them with nourishment for their growth and renovation. Some of them, as those of which the bones and ligaments are formed, seem to per- form no living action, but that of duly appropriating the nutritious matter thus afforded, so as to preserve their structure in a healthy or perfect state, and this is named their Nutritive Action. Other tissues, as the muscular and glandular, in addition to the power of nutrition, possess various remarkable vital properties, wliich are named their Functions. Both the nutritive and functional actions of the tissues are subject to disorder. When the former are perverted, alteration of the structure necessarily results, as is seen in the growth of tumours or the formation of ulcers ; but the latter may be dis- turbed without any obvious change of this kind, as when the digestion of food or the secretion of urine is imperfectly performed, without any perceptible difference in the stomach or kidney. Derangement of function, however, is most frequently connected B2 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. with alteration of structure, and very apt to lead to it. Dis- ordered action, whether of function or nutrition, constitutes Disease, to remedy which is the object of Medicine. As the field of medicine is thus very extensive, it has been divided into Physic and Surgery,—the former department com- prehending chiefly internal complaints, while the latter includes those wliich are situated externally, or require for their treat- ment the use of external means. The art of Surgery consists in the performance of the various manual duties required in the employment of these means ; while the science of Surgery directs their choice and application. In the diseases which constitute the surgical department of medicine,—^if we except those depending on the introduction of foreign substances, the retention of secretions, and the presence of concretions in the cavities and canals of the body,—there is always alteration of structure, wliich may be owing either to mor- bid nutrition, or to external violence. In both cases, reparation is to be effected, not by mechanical art, but by the action of the nutrient vessels ; and all that the surgeon can do, is to remove obstacles impeding their salutary operation. When he speaks of healing a wound, for instance, he means nothing more than placing the part concerned in the most favourable circumstances for undergoing this reparatory process. It is therefore necessary, in entering upon the study of Surgery, to become acquainted with the various actions of these vessels, whether tending to the injury or reparation of structure. And as it very generally happens, that there is interposed, between the natural actions and those alterative of the structure, a diseased condition, which has been named Inflammation, this must be considered in the first place. Symptoms of Inflammation. By inflammation is understood that condition of a part in which it is red, swelled, hot, and painful, along with more or less fever, or constitutional disturbance. But there is stiU another circumstance of this morbid state, which, though it was not for-3 INFLAMMATION. merly so much noticed, is really the most important of the whole ; that is, perversion of the vital action in the part affected, which is truly essential, and never-faUing,—^while the other symptoms are extremely variable in their degree, and not even constant in their existence. Inflammation may therefore be defined as a perverted action of the capillary system, generally attended with heat, redness, and swelling. Redness.—This symptom is owing to distension of the vessels which convey blood; to blood being admitted into those which usually appear to receive only the colourless part of it, whether this be owing to the red globules not entering at- all, or only so few at a time as to conceal their colour, since it is only when ex- isting in considerable assemblages that they appear red; and also to bloody effusion into the iaterstices of the structure con- cerned. Inflammation ,of the conjunctiva affords one of the best examples of these changes. The redness varies considerably in shade. It is generally bright and florid, like that of arterial blood, but it often has a yeUow hue, and still more J&equently is dark, or almost purple. The yellow tinge is most fi-equently observed along with derange- ment of the biliary secretion, as in erysipelas; but the dark colour depends on different circumstances, the discrimination of which is of great importance in practice. It was formerly thought a certaiu indication of putrid tendency, or proneness to die from weakness, and an unquestionable call for administering wine, bark, and cordials. It is now observed to depend fre- quently on obstruction of the respiratory function, preventing the blood .from undergoing its proper change. It is seen also when the venous circulation of an inflamed part is impeded. Swelling.—^This symptom depends partly on the enlargement of the vessels, but chiefly on effusion of the serous or albuminous parts of the blood, or the blood itself, into the cellular texture. It consequently varies with the vascularity and laxity of the tissue concerned. Thus inflammation of the conjunctiva is attended with gi'eat swelling, while that of the cornea is accom- panied by hardly any.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 4 Heat.—This is a veiy characteristic syniptoui of inflammation, and, together with the redness, has no donbt led to the choice of a title for expressing it, since in all languages the term used for this purpose denotes burning. Like the last mentioned symptom, the sensation of heat varies with the part affected. It is most remarkable in the skin, and in some parts of the mucous mem- brane, as the urethra. It was formerly believed that the patient's feeling of heat de- pended always on a real and proportionate elevation of tempera- ture ; but the application of a thermometer at once proves this opinion to be incorrect. John Hunter investigated the subject, and came to the following conclusions :—1. That the heat of an inflamed part is not commensurate with the patient's feelings. 2. That it does not exceed the standard or central heat of the individual, 3. That the greatest increase of temperature takes place in those parts which are furthest from the centre, and naturally coldest. Thus inflammation of the scrotum, induced by laying open the tunica vaginalis, raises the thermometer from 92° to 98°. But if the disease elevates the general heat of the individual, the temperature of the inflamed part rises to the same degi'ee, as in erysipelas, where the heat of the inflamed sldn is frequently 104°. Pain.—This is one of the most constant symptoms of inflam- mation. It is generally proportioned to the violence of the dis- order and the sensibility of the part afiected; but there are many exceptions to the latter part of this rule; and some tissues, as those of the osseous and fibrous kinds, which are not aU sensible in their healthy state, occasion the most acute suffering when inflamed. The sensibility of every part in the body is increased by inflammation; and if this has ever been denied, it must have been from confounding insensibility to those stimuli which recLuire, for making an impression, that the organ to which they are applied should perform a functional action for their reception, with insensibility to chemical and mechanical stimuli, which always excite more sensation when applied to an inflamed part, than to one in a healthy state. Thus during inflammation the5 INFLAMMATION. eye may be iiufit for vision, while the impression of light pro- duces a painful effect. The pain of inflammation varies in kind as well as in degree; being sometimes hot and burning, as in the skin and mucous membranes, at other times sharp and cutting, as in the serous membranes, or dull and aching, as, in the bones. , It is impossible, in the present state of oui* knowledge, to account for these varieties in the pain, or even for the existence of pain at all. It is usually ascribed to the swelling that accom- panies iaflammation, causing pressure on the extremities of the nei-ves, whence it is said the most compact tissues occasion the severest pain ; but this explanation is not satisfactory, as many which possess the softest and most yielding structure excite exciaiciating pain when they are inflamed,-of which the mucous membranes afford a remarkable example. The pain is not always felt at the part affected, but often at a distance from it, as at the point of the penis when the bladder is inflamed, in the right shoulder during inflammation of the liver, or in distant parts of the limb when the joints are the seat of disease. We are sometimes able to account partly for this by the nei'vous communications, but more frequently it is quite inexphcable, though highly deserving of attention in a practical point of view. Derangement of Functional Action.—This symptom of inflam- mation cannot, of course, attend the inflammation of every tissue, and must be confined to those which i)ossess some vital property in addition to that of mere nutrition. It is sometimes, however, the only symptom present, or at least the only one that can be recognised; as when the organ affected is contained in an internal cavity. When the function of the organ is to receive the impression of some external stimulus, as that of the eye or the nose, it is performed either imperfectly, or not at all; and hence, as already observed, some have been led into the error of supposing, that the common sensibility of parts is diniinislied during inflammation. Deranfjemcnt of Nutritive Action.—In addition to the serous6 PKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. and bloody effusions into the cellular texture, wMcli always take place to more or less extent, tlie most frequent indication of a change in. the action of the nutritive apparatus is softening of the tissue concerned. In some cases this alteration is so remarkable, that it has been thought necessary to designate it by a peculiar expression, viz., ramollissemcnt. This effect of inflammation is, on many occasions, of great importance, but at present deserves attention chiefly as affording evidence that the nutritive process is not performed in its usual manner. Another fact which leads to the same conclusion is the rapidity with which putre- faction proceeds after death, in parts where inflammation has previously existed. It may be said that the more than usual proportion of fluids congested by the diseased action may ac- covmt for this speedy decomposition, without supposing that the constituent particles are altered by it in their relation to each other. But, in such a view of the matter, we ought to observe the same putrefactive tendency equally strong in parts where blood has been simply effused .into their texture, which is not the case. Constitutional Disturhance.—The disturbance of the system, or Fever, as it is called, which accompanies inflammation, con- sists of an alteration in the performance of all the functions of the body. The phenomena, which are in consequence exhibited, vary very much, according to peculiarities of the patient's con- stitution, and the part which is inflamed. Generally, the pulse is hard and frequent, beating from 80 to 120, and in children much faster,—the respiration is hurried,—the face is flushed,— the eyes are suffused,—the tongue is white and loaded,—there is no appetite,—inordinate thirst,—headache,—constipation,— scanty urine,—dryness of the skin,—confusion of ideas or delirium,—and prostration of strength in the voluntary muscles. This state of general disturbance, which is named Inflammatorj'- or Symptomatic Fever, does not always accompany inflammation, and is usually proportioned to the violence of the local symptoms. Its type or chaxacter also varies, as already mentioned, accord- ing to tlie part or patient affected. The pulse may be small.INFLAMMATION. 7 feeble, and ii-regiilar or intermittent,—the tongue brown, smooth, and glazed,—the countenance dark-coloured, contracted, and anxious. These varieties in the symptoms of fever demand great attention, as indications of the seat and degree of the local disorder, and as guides for directing the remedial measures. The state of the blood, also, in this condition, requires particular consideration. When blood is taken from one labouring under inflammatory- fever, instead of coagulating as usual into a homogeneous red tremulous mass, it throws up to the surface a clear transparent fluid, which coagulates into an opaque buff-coloured, tough, membranous-looking crust, which is named the buffy coat. It is usually about a quarter of an inch thick, and presents a concave siuface, owing apparently to preserving its original extent, while the subjacent part of the clot contracts during the separation of the serum. Whatever hastens the coagulation of the blood tends to prevent the formation of the buffy coat. Thus weakness of the individual,—smallness in the quantity of blood abstracted,— exposure of it to an extensive surface of dead matter,—and its being abstracted in a small stream or by drops, all oppose the appearance in question. The formation of the buffy coat has therefore been supposed to depend merely upon slowness of coagulation, allov/ing the red j)articles to descend, and leave the fibrinous portion pure; but there is certainly something more than this concerned in the process, since the tough yellow crust under consideration differs materially in appearance from the fibrinous mass which is obtained by washing away the colouring matter of healthy coagnlated blood, and when the disposition to its production is strong, it takes place notwithstanding the most rapid coagulation ; while blood drawn from an animal in health may be retained for a long time fluid, without shewing any trace of it. The constituent proportion of fibrine seems to be actually increased, and there is a preternatural tendency to its separation from the blood, both while it circulates in the vessels, and after it is withdrawn from the body. The buffy coat, though very generally, is not invariably, observed during inflammatory fever ;8 PHINCIPLES OF SURGERY. and it also appears occasionally, though no inflammation exists. Pregnancy, and violent agitation, whether of body or mind, are apt to cause its formation. Inflammation terminates in various ways. Sometimes all the symptoms disappear, and the part resumes its natural con- dition, when it is said to terminate in Eesolution. At other times it ends by destroying the life of the part; and is then said to terminate in Mortification. It also terminates in various actions, producing alteration of the structure, or the separation of matters from the blood, differing in quantity or quality from those naturally secreted by it. Of these the most remarkable are the following:—The formation of a peculiar fluid named Pus, which is called Suppuration,—the Effusion of serum, or lymph, i.e., the fibrine, in a state resembling the buffy coat,—the re- moval of solid or fluid parts of the body, which is named Absorption,—and the production of some solid structure, differ- ing in quantity or quality from that naturally existing, which may be designated Diseased Nutrition. Inflammation has been variously divided and named, accord-" ing to its termination,—^the predominant local, and constitutional symptoms,—the degree of its violence,—and the part affected. Most of these distinctions, so far from simplifying the subject, have tended greatly to obscure and perj)lex it. Instead of causing inflammation to be regarded as a morbid action, always of the same nature, and merely modified in its symptoms and termination, according to the part and constitution affected, they<have made it appear a group of dissimilar processes, ar- ranged under one title, but widely and essentially different from each other Inflammation of particular organs and tissues is expressed in modern nomenclature by adding the termination itis to the anatomical title of the part affected, as Iritis, Gastritis, Phlebitis. For some parts the old and peculiar appellations are still re- tained,—as Erysipelas for inflammation of the skin, Ophthalmia for that of the eye. ^'^^INFLAMMATION. 9 giushed; for which piu'pose the terms Acute and Chronic are employed to denote the two extremes of violence, while the in- termediate degrees are indicated by qualifying epithets. Acute inflammation frequently passes into the chronic ; hut the latter often exists independently and originally. When the inflamma- tion is acute, it terminates one way or another in a few days at furthest, and sometimes even in a few hours ; but when chronic, it may exist for weeks or months with little change. With acute inflammation there is almost always accompanying fever; but with chronic hardly any. Causes of Inflammation. The causes of Inflaromation, or circumstances which give rise to this morbid state, are very numerous and various. They may be divided into those which act directly on the part affected, and those which do so through the medium of the system. The direct causes of inflammation, or local irritants, as they are usually called, comprehend all the natural stimuli of action when excessive in degree or continuance; various animal, vegetable, and mineral matters, such as cantharides, croton oil, and tartrate of antimony, which are named irritants from their effects; and every sort of violence, whether chemical or mechanical, which alters the structure of the body. The effect of these causes varies with the irritability or tendency to excited action of the part or patient. Parts are generally irritable in proportion to their vascidarity and sensi- bility. Thus the iris is more readily excited to inflammation than the cornea. But there are many exceptions to this rule; and particular tissues are most under the influence of particular irritations. The urinary bladder, for instance, is irritated by distension ; and the joints by forcible extension of their liga- ments. Parts occasionally become more irritable than usual. The circumstance of having been previously irritated sometimes renders them so. Weakness or diminished power of action, also, as from interruption of either the nerves or blood-vessels, or any other cause, contrary to what one might expect, produces thePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 10 same effect. Habit, or the continued exposure to an irritation, lessens its effect. The differences observed in constitutional irritability are very strildng and important. Sometimes they seem to depend on original or congenital peculiarities of the system; but very freqiiently proceed from the injuiious effect of deviations from propriety in diet or exercise. They are also often connected with mental irritation, which has a powerful influence over the irritability of the body. In these different states of the system, the same local irritation produces the most opposite effects ; and while one individual may have his limb lacerated and the bone shattered without suffering so much inflammation as to occasion symptomatic fever, another dies from the intense action excited by the prick of a pinj [|The common expressions of a good and bad constitution are nearly equivalent to the possession of little or much tendency to suffer irritation from causes of disturbance; and the difference in tliis respect, as has been already obsei-ved, may either depend upon congenital peculiarity, or be acquired through circumstances connected with the mode of life. A most important fact in relation to the effect of irritation is, that it generally proves inconsiderable when another wliich had been previously in existence, and exciting disturbance, is re- moved by its means. The success of operations frequently depends on this principle, as when amputation is performed on account of a diseased joint, which has kept up excitement for a considerable time without too greatly reducing the patient's strength. The indirect causes of irritation, or those which act through the medium of the system, constitute a difficult, but veiy inte- resting and highly necessary subject of study. .One of the most remarkable differences between animals and vegetables is the mutual dependence of the component parts of the former. Though each part is induced to act by particular stimuli, and produces peculiar effects, the whole are so connected togetlier that one can hardly be affected without causing more or less disturbance of others. Sometimes the whole system suffers, and11 INFLAMMATION. then fever results ; at other times the consequent disorder is confined to a part merely. Tliis fellow-suffering, whether partiatl or general, is usually expressed by the term Sympathy. Variovis explanations have been offered to account for it, of which the following are most deserving of notice :—1. The anastomosis of j Blood-vessels, as that of the epigastric and mammary arteries, to | which has been attributed the fellow-sufferiag of the iiterus and mamma; 2. Continuity of Texture, as that of the conjunctiva, and lining membrane of the nose, to which the sneezing caused by exposing the eyes to a bright light has been referred; 3. Nervous Communication, as that between the phrenic and cervical nerves, which has been supposed to account for pain being felt in the shoulder when the liver is inflamed ; 4. The Medium of Sensation, as when stimulants applied to the nose cause sneezing, though .they do not induce this effect during insensibility; 5, Participation in the same function, as when the breasts become painful in the early months of pregnancy. None of these explanations adjnit of general application in accounting for sympathy; and many cases of it are not explicable by any of them. But though the cause of sympathy is at present, and probably ever will be, beyond the reach of human under- standing, the facts which are generally observed in regard to its manifestations are fair subjects of inquiry, and of the utmost importance in practice. Of these, the six following, or what may be called the laws of sympathetic action, deserve especial attention:— — 1. Disturbance of action in one part occasions disturbance in. others. In a healthy state of the system, all the organs perform certain actions with a certain degree of vigour, and whenever any onie of them has its activity either excited or diminished, more or less change ensues in the action of others, which may thus become disordered in whole or in part. The effect of excited action in causing sympathetic derangement is weU known, as in the common case of fever attending inflammation; but the consequences of diminished action are more apt to be12 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. overlooked, tliougli not less frequent, or less productive of serious disease. The most extensive and frequent derangement Aviiich occurs in this way proceeds from interruption of the mucous secretion of the intestiual canal. All./fefctentive practitioners have remarked, that when the bowels Become costive, various diseases are apt to break out in distant parts of the body. This has been attributed to irritation caused by retention of the faeces, and to the effect of an inflamed state of the b'ning membrane of the bowels, but it may be more correctly referred to interruption of the usual secretion. Next in order as a source of derange- ment, from diminution of usual action, ought to be reckoned the skin. The effects of checked perspiration, or mere chOling of the skin, in occasioning general fever and local inflammation, are constantly presented to our attention. "Whenever an accustomed secretion or action of any kind is suppressed, though there may not ensue indications of actual disturbance, there is always a strong disposition to it; and therefore all operations, even of the most trivial land, ought to be abstained from in such circumstances, as the direct irritation proceeding from them, together with the indirect inducement to derangement already present, might probably occasion violent local and general disorder. 2. A diseased action may, from long continuance, become as it were adopted by the system, so as to occasion disturbance by its suppression. The fact is weU known to the vulgar, who have in conse- quence the greatest dread of interfering with local complaints of long standing, especially such of them as are attended with dis- charges. This prejudice is no doubt generally carried too far; but it should be carefully recollected, that excited and disordered action of a part, which has from habit ceased to irritate the sys- tem, cannot be suddenly removed without the risk of causiug general derangement. Thus, when disease of a bone has oc- casioned the discharge of matter for a number of years, amputa- tion, especially in adults, is found to be almost certainly fatal. 3. All parts of the body do not sympathise with equal readi-13 INFLAMMATION. ness—^biit seem to be influenced by continuity of texture, con- tiguity of situation, and participation in the same function. As examples, may be mentioned the connection which is veiy fre- quently observed between affections of the mucous membrane at different parts of the body—the suppuration of the cheek which is apt to be caused by the irritation of a decayed tooth—and the fellow-suffering which is displayed by the breast and uterus in the derangements of each other. 4. Excited action of one part may take the place of that in another, the system seeming inadequate to the support of both. This translation of disease from one part to another is named Metastasis, and constitutes a most important principle of prac- tice, as being the foundation of what is called couuter-irrita- tion, or the excitement of artificial disease for the relief of others more inconvenient or dangerous, as in the common case of a blister being applied to the chest to relieve disturbance of the lungs. 5. Pain, hemorrhage, inflammation, increased nutrition, and excited secretion, take the place of each other, so that they may be regarded as equivalents of action. Thus in the disease named tic doulouretuc, an intensely painful affection, which usually pro- ceeds from derangement of the mucous secretions, the most effectual relief is obtained by causing copious discharges from the bowels through the operation of powerful purgatives. The monthly discharges of blood from females cease when the nutri- tion of the fcetm in utero commences—or when a large tumour is formed in any part of the body; it also does not appear while the secretion of milk continues; and when, independently of these conditions, it ceases to appear, local inflammation, as that of the eye, is apt to occur. The local abstraction of blood and the establishment of suppurating surfaces are every day prac- tised for the counteraction of inflammation. It is unnecessary to mention more examples of such counterbalancing effects ; but it must be observed, that the exchange is more ready between some of these morbid states than others, wliich must be attended to in the use of counter-irritation.14 PRINCIPLES OF SUliGERY. 6. General disturbance or fever, however induced, is apt to terminate in some local affection. Most people have what may be called their M'eak part, which gives way on such occasions, and in many acts like a safety- valve, by protecting organs of more importance; as when sore throat, herpetic eruptions of the ears, or erysipelas, is apt to re- sult from constitutional disturbance. This proneness to parti- cular local diseases may be either congenital or the result of habit. In the former case it leads to what is called hereditary disease, of which gout may be mentioned as an example. Treatment of Inflammation. The great object in treating inflammation is to make it ter- minate in Eesolution,—that is, to subside and disappear without leaving any change in the structure or actions of the part. The most obvious step in the first instance with this view is removal of the cause which excited the disease, should it still continue in operation. When the cause is direct, this can sometimes be accomplished speedily and perfectly, as when a foreign body occasions disturbance by its presence. Bub when it is of an in- direct kind, such as the suppression of some natural secretion or discharge, from the mucous membrane or uterus for instance, the process for removing it is generally more difiicult, reqiiii'ing the careful administration of medicine and strict attention to regi- men. When the cause cannot be remedied at once, or when the inflammation continues after its cause has .ceased to operate, which is generally the case, the morbid action requires the use of means for its suppression. The symptoms of inflammation naturally suggest the abstrac- tion of blood,—and this until lately has accordingly always been regarded as its great antidote, though much less often really re- quired than was formerly believed. Blood may be withdrawn locally, from the inflamed part or its neighbourhood, and gene- rally, from the larger veins or smaller arteries. The veins are almost always preferred for this purpose, from being more super- ficial than the arteries, whence they are more easily opened, andINFLAMMATION. 15 from beiiig more easily closed. Those at the bend of the arm, the external jugular, and more rarely the veins of the hand and foot, are chosen for venesection. Venesection.—The patient should be placed in a reclining posture, unless the peculiar circumstances of his case should render some other more convenient; a bandage is then to be put twice round the arm, about an inch above where it is proposed to open the vessel, and tied with sufficient force to obstruct the veins without impeding the current of the artery. The surgeon now chooses the largest vein, which is generally the median basilic—puts the limb into such a position as may be preserved while the blood is flowing, and presses the thumb of one hand upon the vessel immediately below where he proposes to punc- ture it, in order to prevent it from rolling, and the blood from escaping until he is ready to receive it; then holding the lancet with the other hand, he introduces it into the vein obliquely, in respect to the direction of the vessel. "When the blood appears, he ceases to push the instrument deeper, but carries it a little further forward, in order to enlarge the opening of the vein; and, lastly, elevates the point, so as to make the external wound of sufficient size. The pressure of the thumb is then removed, and the blood is allowed to flow so long as seems proper. The surgeon, when a sufficient quantity has been abstracted, slackens the bandage—places his thumb upon the orifice—cleanses the arm from blood—lays a small compress of folded lint on the wound—and applies with moderate firmness a single turn of a bandage in the figure of 8. It frequently happens, from the operator making too small a wound, or the opening of the vein ceasing to correspond with that of the skin, that the blood enters the cellular substance, and constitutes a tumour, which is named Thrombus. It produces no inconvenience, further than arresting the flow of blood.; and if from this, or any other cause, the quantity desired cannot be ob- tained, it is better to open another vein, than to run the risk of exciting inflammation in the one already wounded, by introduc- ing probes, or using any other contrivances for assisting the16 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. blood to escape. When the patient is fat, or the vessel small, the surgeon, not being able to see the veins, must feel for them ; and then the one already mentioned, the median basilic, is gene- rally recognised most easUy, both from its large size and regular situation, on the inner side of the tendinous attachment of the biceps to the fascia of the fore-arm. The humeral artery lies under the vein at this point, but runs no danger of being "wounded, unless the lancet is used with undue force. The only artery that can be injured in a natural distribution of the vessels is the humeral; but the arteries of the fore-arm frequently take a superficial course, which makes them assume the appearance of veins ; whence it is always proper to ascertain, before intro- ducing the lancet, that the vessel is really a vein by its want of pulsation. The cutaneous nerves are so small and intimately connected with the veins, that they cannot be avoided by any precaution; and there is reason to believe, from the acute pain occasionally complained of, that they are not unfrequently divided; but bad consequences seldom if ever result, either from this source or the alleged pricldng of tendons, which was formerly much dreaded. When any local inconvenience results from the operation, it is now thought to depend upon inflamma- tion of the skin, cellular substance, or vein, owing to peculiar irritability of the patient's constitution, or the manner in which the surgeon has inflicted or dressed the wound. These accidents will be best avoided by performing the operation as has been de- scribed above; and when they do occur, ought to be treated according to the principles which will be explained hereafter, in connection with the textures liable to injury. The external jugular may be rendered sufficiently tense for being opened, by pressing on it with the thumb a little above the clavicle. The lancet may then be introduced in the same way as has been recommended; and if the incision be made in the direction of the sterno-mastoid muscle, it will not only insure the division of the superjacent fibres of the platysma myoides, but also have the proper degree of obliquity in respect to the coats of the vein. The edge of the cup, which is toINFLAMMATION. 17 receive the blood, being held tightly below the aperture, will determine the blood to flow through it; and when a sufficient quantity has been obtained, its further escape will be easily pre- vented by applying a small compress of lint, which should be retained by two crossing shps of adhesive plaster, rather than by a bandage encircling the neck, as this might reinduce the bleeding. Artcriotomy.—The only artery now ever opened intentionally for the abstraction of blood is the temporal. Either its anterior or middle branch may be selected, but the former is the most convenient; and the best part of its course for the purpose is just where it begins to be covered by the hairs of the head, a few of which ought to be shaved off previously to the operation. The artery is sometimes so large and superficial that it may be opened in the same way^ as a vein ; but, in general, this method wordd not succeed, as the* small size and depth of the vessel render it extremely difficult to avoid either cutting its coats entirely across or pricking them slightly, in both of which cases the blood does not flow freely. Many plans have been proposed to obviate tliis difficulty, but the simplest and su.rest is to place the points of the fore and middle fingers over the artery so as to ascertain and mark its course—then to make an oblique incision about half an inch long with a lancet through the integuments over the vessel where it lies between the fingers—and lastly, to introduce the instrument gently again and again nntil the blood springs out. The operation may also be rendered more certain by using a small cupping-glass having an oval aperture fitted to the shape of the temporal region ; even if the artery should have been completely divided, this means will induce the blood to flow from it. To stop the hemorrhage a firm compress of lint should be placed on the wound, and then a bandage a yard or two long, and an inch broad, roUed up at each of its extremities, being applied first to the opposite side of the head, should be brought round and crossed over the arteiy, after which its ends are to be carried back again in the opposite direction, and this repeated until sufficient pressure is effected. 0PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 18 Effects of Bleeding.—The first effect noticed is a diminution iu the force and rapidity of the circulation, wMch is manifested by the pnlse becoming slower and softer. By and by the motion of the heart is so much weakened that it no longer propels the blood with sufficient force to support the functions of the brain. The individual becomes pale—^lie complains of weakness and nausea, which sometimes proceeds to vomiting, but more fre- qixently, the functions of the brain becoming more and more completely suspended, he loses all power of sensation and volun- tary motion—he is no longer able to stand or sit—there are frequently slight tremors of the muscles, and in some rare cases violent convulsive contractions of them—he makes some deep inspirations and expirations—looks wildly about him, and falls into a state closely resembling death, which is named Syncope. Syncope occurs most readily when the patient is in an erect posture, and a veiy large quantity oT blood may be withdrawn without inducing it if ho lies horizontally. The most effectual method of recovering one from this state is consequently to lay him do^vn with his head on the same level as his body. The quantity of blood which must be abstracted to induce syncope in ordinary circumstances is extremely variable. Sometimes several pounds may be withdi-awn before its symptoms appear, and at other times a few ounces are sufficient for the x^uipose; the patient's mental alarm has a considerable share in producing the effect, but in general sixteen or twenty ounces are required. "When the patient is very weak, or very largely depleted, the syncope either passes directly into death, or is succeeded by an intermediate state, named Sinking. In this condition the pulse is small, feeble, and intermittent; the countenance is deadly pale, and bedewed with clammy moisture : the extremities are cold, and the patient has a distressing sensation of weakness. He lies in a dozing state ; and when roused from it, takes some time to recollect his situation, often at first exjjressing himself incoherently. His breathing is imeasy, being performed with dilatation of the nostrils, and is frequently attended with slight crepitation, or mucous rattle in the chest. This state, after con-19 INFLAMMATION. tiuuing for hours, or it may be even for days, terminates in recovery or in death. When the quantity of blood abstracted is not too great, in proportion to the strength of the patient, there is a recovery or reaction of the system. After an ordinary syncope, the symptoms go off in the inverse order of their approach ; and when the patient has completely regained his faculties, it is generally observed tliat the actions wliich were suspended are performed with a slight degree of excitement. Tliis is most observable with regard to the pulse, wliich is rather more shai'p and fre- quent for some time afterwards than it was before, provided the patient did not labour under any febrile disturbance. This excess of reaction is observed to be proportioned in degi-ee to the strength of the patient and the quantity of blood withdrawn, provided it is not so large as at once to induce sink- ing or death ; and, in circumstances favourable for its production, may become so excessive as to simulate closely the symptoms of inflammatory fever. The pulse is extremely fi-equent, and has a peculiar jarring or jerking sort of character—the respiration is hurried—the face is flushed—the eyes are red and suffused—^the patient complains of intense headache, and distracting noises in his ears—and when blood is drawn it exhibits the buffy coat, though hardly the cupped surface which is seen during inflam- mation. The local symptoms of inflammation are not wanting; and the brain, with its membranes, is the part which most fre- quently suffers; but the viscera of the thorax and abdomen are not exempt from risk. This curious state, for pointing out which we are much indebted to Dr. Marshall Hall, may be induced either by one or two very large bleedings, or by a mmiber of small ones, causing a continued drain on the system for days, weeks, or months; and accordingly, as it occurs in one or other of these ways, the symptoms vary in the degree of their violence or acuteness. It may teiminate in fatal effusion on the brain, or some other im- portant organ, in sinking, or in a return to health. Bleeding, as might be expected, though it affords temporary relief, is a]pt to20 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. increase the evil, either by making the state of excitement more quickly terminate in sinking, or by increasing the violence of its symptoms. Perfect rest, both of body and mind; cold applica- tions to the head; gentle opiates ; and the gradual operation of time, ought to be trusted to as the means of relief. The discrimination between the symptoms of excessive reaction and those of inflammation, is of the utmost importance in practice; and the following observations as to the circum- stances which modify the effects of hemorrhage are deserving of much attention. In young subjects, that is to say, children and infants, the power of reaction is feeble, and the risk of siiiking consequently great; but if the immediate danger be surmounted, recovery is accomplished quickly and perfectly. In adults who are weak from age or any other cause, there is also small power of reaction; but their danger of sinking is not merely in the first instance, and continues for a much longer time afterwards, as the restoration to health is slow and im- perfect. In the healthy and robust individual there is always exces- sive reaction, unless the bleeding be so small as not to affect the system sufficiently, or so profuse as to cause sinking or death in the first instance. Pain, fear, and the exhaustion produced by protracted fever or the discharge of matter, increase the risk of sinking. Local Bleeding.—Blood may be abstracted locally by scarify- ing, leeching, and cupping. The fii'st method can be employed only when the j)art in- flamed is superficial, or when the skin and subjacent cellular texture are affected. In which cases incisions are often useful, not only by allowing blood to escape, but by relieving tension. Leeches should be dried before they are used, and the part to which they are applied ought to be carefully washed with warm water. When they are wished to fasten at a particular point, they should be enclosed in a small cone of paper or linen, which allows merely the head to project. After they fall off, the21 INFLAMMATION. bleeding is to be encouraged by fomentations or a poultice, unless it proves excessive, as sometimes happens, particularly in children, when a small piece of lint ©ught to "be pressed firmly on the wound. If this means should fail, which it seldom does, the nitrate of silver may be applied, or the wound may be trans- fixed by a small needle or pia, and tied with a thread. The quantity of blood obtained by cupping depends greatly on the part which is chosen for the purpose. The skin should be well fomented before the operation, and carefully protected from the influence of cold during its performance. The glasses should have wide mouths, and be frequently emptied, to prevent the blood from coagulating over the wounds, which opposes its flow, unless they be made of such a shape as to prevent this. The most convenient form, especially to an operator not practised in the management of ordinary cup-shaped vessels, wliich require to be frequently emptied and reapplied, is that of a distended leech—^the glass being about six inches long and two inches wide at the mouth. In using this apparatus a piece of paper mois- tened with spirits is introduced into it and kindled—the mouth is then applied over the wounds which have been made by the scarificator-—and, the bulging part of the vessel being placed in a dependent position, the blood continues to flow into it without coagulating upon the orifices, until a sufficient quantity is obtained. Purgatives.—These are substances that, when introduced into the intestinal canal, produce more or less irritation : the effect of which is a greater secretion from the mucous membrane, and in- creased contraction of the muscular fibres. In consequence of this double operation, the dejections are more frequent and copious than usual; and the patient is not only relieved in the way of metastasis, that is, from having an action excited at a distance from the diseased one, but also has those secretions restored, the suppression of which is frequently the indirect cause of inflammation. Many different purgatives are employed in medicine; but the most useful in subduing inflammation are calomel, colocynth,PRINCIPLES OF SUHCERY. 22 jalap, rhubarb, croton oil, and sulphate of magnesia. The saline purgatives induce a very copious secretion from the whole sur- face of the intestines, whUe calomel is thought to act more j)ar- ticularly on the liver, by restoring or promoting its secretion. The blue pill and rhubarb are very beneficial in gradually restoring these actions to a state of liealth when their disturb- ance has occasioned chronic inflammation. Purgative agents are often introduced into the rectum with the view of hastening the effect of those administered by the inouth, or superseding the necessity of their use, when from any circumstance their employment happens to be inconvenient. The gi'and essential of these injections, clysters, or enemata, as they are named, is quantity sufficient to distend the rectum, since this is the proper stimulus of that gut. From one to two pounds of gruel, or simply tepid water, should be used, and made more or less irritating, according to circumstances, by the addition of common salt, olive oil, castor oil, sulphate of mag- nesia, or oil of turpentine, etc. Various apparatus used to be employed for the purpose of injection ; but the simple and efficient means of Read's syringe, and Higginson's tube, have superseded all the others. Diapliorctics.—These are remedies wliich, in the effect they produce, bear the same relation to the sldn that purgatives do to the mucous membrane of the intestines. They increase the action of the sldn, and are thus beneficial either in the "way of metastasis, or in removing the cause of the inflammation, by re- storing a secretion which has been suppressed. The salts of ammonia have a diaphoretic effect ] but, being of a stimulating nature, are questionable remedies for subduing excited action of the system. The Aqua Acctatis Ammonice, however, may be given with much advantage in small doses, from time to time, after the force of the disease has been broken by other means. Ipecacuan is less objectionable in this respect, and the combination of it with opium, constituting Dover's powder, is often extremely useful. By far the best diaphoretic, however, for subduing inflammfitory action, is the tartrate ofINFLAMMATION. 23 antimony, given in small and frequently repeated doses, so as to maintain a sliglit nausea, or even occasional vomiting. Tlie warm bath is a powerful diaphoretic, and would often be very advantageous if it could be procured ; but the difficulties which usually attend its employment in private practice are so great as almost to proscribe it. The vapour-bath is more readily administered, and may perhaps come into general use. All the apparatus required is a piece of lead or tin tube three or four feet in length, a tea kettle, and a blanket. The patient sits on a stool near the fire and covered with the blanket. The tube is attached to the spout of the kettle by one extremity, and has the other placed under the stool. The heat may be ascertained by a thermometer, and regulated by the degree of ebullition. Much benefit is frequently derived from the semi-cupium or hip-bath, and the pediluvium or foot-bath; and still more local baths are of great service in the form of Fomentations and Poultices. Fomentation is generally effected by applying a piece of flannel or a sponge wi'ung out of hot water, and changing this from time to time as it cools, for the space of fifteen or twenty minutes. A flannel bag containing chamomile flowers, and allowed to cool sufiiciently after being boiled a short while, is preferred by many for the purpose ; and a decoction of poppy heads also is occa- sionally employed. Poultices may be prepared from any sub- stance which, together with warm water or milk, constitutes a soft pulpy mass, capable of retaining the heat and moisture. Bread, barley-meal, and linseed-meal, are chiefly used; but caiTots, turnips, and leaves such as those of spinach and hemlock, are thought preferable in certain cases. These articles are either enclosed in a thin linen or muslin bag, or placed directly on the part concerned, in which case it is necessary to spread some butter or other oily substance on the poultice, to prevent it from adheiing inconveniently to the surface of the body. Instead of poultices, some folds of lint, moistened with hot water, may be applied, and covered with a piece of oiled silk. Heat is some- times applied locally without moisture, as by means of a bag containing heated salt, but is then found to be not so efficacious.PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. 24 Narcotics.—These are medicines wliicli, witliout causing any real diminution in the power of the system, produce a temporary indisposition for action. Of these the most useful are opium, tobacco, hyoscyamus, and belladonna. Astringents.—These are remedies somewhat similar in effect to those last mentioned. Cold, acetate of lead, and nitrate of silver, are the best means of this kind. Cold is more efi&cient in j)reventing than curiug inflammation. It is of no use unless it can be applied either to the part affected or in its immediate neighbourhood ; and then only when the diseased action pro- ceeds fiom direct irritation. The acetate of lead is used exter- nally in solution, eitlier alone or along with opium, in the pro- portion of three or four grains of each to the ounce. It is generally applied warm, and has great effect in allaying inflam- mation depending on imdue irritability. Pressure.—When the part or system is disposed to overact by the weakness of its power, especially when it is attended with •cedematous swelling, pressure may often be exercised advan- tageously by bandaging. Countcr-irntanis.—The means of removing inflammation which are included under this title act on the principle of metastasis, and excite irritation of various degrees as to intensity and duration. The most gentle in their effect are named rube- facients, of which may be mentioned mustard, oil of turpentine, ammonia, gum ammoniac, camphor, and some of the mineral acids. Blisters or vesicatories are applications which, as the name implies, occasion blisters of the skin or elevations of the cuticle, by fluid diffused under it in consequence of their irrita- tion. The plaster of cantharides is most frequently employed for this purpose ; but, when the effect is wished to be strong and immediate, recourse may be had to boiling water, or the concentrated mineral acids. The nitrate of silver is occasionally preferred for the purpose, being rubbed on the part after it has been moistened with water. So soon as the blisters caused in either of these ways have risen, they ought to be cut, so as to allow the serous fluid theyINFLAMMATION. 25 coutain to escape, after wliicli the surface is to be dressed with some simple ointment. In order to prolong the irritation of blisters, it used to be customary to dress the raw part with an ointment containing savine leaves, or the powder of cantharides, which prevented it from healing, and maintained a discharge of matter. When continued mitation is required, it is now more frequently effected by the tartrate of antimony, wliich, when applied to the skin either in solution or ointment, occasions a pustular eruption, that may be regulated as to extent and dura- tion by the same means. Another mode of causing permanent counter-iiTitation, is to institute a discharge of matter from a breach in the continuity of the skin. The introduction of a seton used to be, and still is, with many people a favourite way of effecting this. The opera- tion is most easily dobe with a seton-needle,—an instrument shaped like a lancet, aboiit three inches long, three-eighths of an inch broad, slightly curved, and having an eye at the blunt end. A fold of skin being held up, the needle is pushed through, and by its means a thread, to which a skein of silk or cotton sufficient to fQl the aperture can then be introduced. In absence of the needle, a straight sharp-pointed bistoury and probe wiU be found to answer nearly as weU, In a few days, when the discharge of matter commences, a new seton may be passed by drawing it through the loop of the old one—and this may theii be repeated daily. Issues are now more frequently employed with this view. They are merely breaches in the surface caused by the knife, caustic, or the actual cautery; that is, red-hot ii'on, Wlien the knife is used, it should be pushed through a fold of the sldn, and then some foreign bodies must be placed in the wound to prevent it from healing. The caustic potass is generally em- X)loyed for opening issues. It may either be applied for three or four hours made into a paste with soap or bread, and limited in its operation by a defence of adhesive plaster, having an aperture cut in it of the requisite size, or simply rubbed in sub- stance upon the skin until the alteration of colour and consis- tence indicates that its effect is sufficient. In cither case, afterPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 26 the action of the caustic is completed, a poultice ought to be applied uiitU the portion of skin tbat has been destroyed sepa- rates, when some foreign substances, such as those already mentioned, must be introduced to prevent the opening from closing. The actual cautery is the best method of the whole, since the breach which it occasions requires no means for keeping it open, and does not heal until after many weeks or months, or healing applications are employed. The pain is severe but almost momentary, and, on the wliole, much less than that of the caustic; while the counter-irritatiag effect is found to be greater than that of any of the other means. Counter-iiTitation may be effected also by moxa. This con- sists in burning small cones of the down of the Artemisia, or what answers eqiially well, provided the combustion be main- taitied by a blow-pipe or bellows, raw cotton made into cylinders from one to two inches wide and three-quarters of an inch thick. Every degree of irritation may be thus produced, from the slightest reddening to the most complete burning; but it is difficult to regulate the effect, and there seems to be no advan- tage in attempting to do so, as the other means which have been mentioned are more under command, and at least equally efficacious. Acupuncture.—This remedy for inflammation must stand by itself. It consists in the introduction of slender needles from one to three inches ui length hito the inflamed pai't by a gentle rotatory motion. No respect is paid in doing this to the import- ance of the organs, and the heart, stomach, arteries, and nenres have all, it is said, been transfixed without any ceremony, though fatal consequences are reported to have sometimes resrdted from this rash practice. No pain or other symptoms of irritation are in general produced, and, on the contrary, a diminution of the inflammatory indications is alleged to be frequently observed. This practice is of ancient origin, and held in much esteem in Eastern countries, where, as iir China and Japan, its employment is said to constitute a distinct department of the surgical profes- sion. Some years ago it was tried pretty extensively in FranceINFLAMMATION. 27 and also in this country, but it now seems to be going, or rather to have ah-eady gone, into disrepute, except in the treatment of Sciatica, where it is of the greatest service. It would seem that the effect of acupuncturation is proportioned, not to the number of the needles, but to the depth they are introduced, and the time they are allowed to remain. I generally use only one at each seat of pain, and leave it for two hours. Choice and Combination of the Means which have been mentioned in treating Inflammation. General bleeding is of no use as a preventive of inflamma- tion, unless it removes some derangement of the system, or counteracts its tendency to excite inflammation. It has most effect at the commencement of inflammation, and is most bene- ficial when there is great power of action. It is better to take a large quantity of blood at first, so as to produce some decided effect, than to bleed frequently by smaU portions. "When it is foiind necessary to take away a large quantity of blood, an opiate given immediately afterwards is useful, by diminishing the tendency to reaction ; and a small bleeding of a few ounces is often serviceable, with the same view, if practised soon after the first one, just when the symptoms of returning action appear. After the force of the disease has been broken by bleeding, if necessary, purgatives and diaphoretics are proper. It is usual to premise the mercurial, and follow them up with the saline ones. The tartrate of antimony is the best diaphoretic, and, by powerfully diminishing the tendency to violent action, in a great measure supersedes the necessity of bleeding, except at the commencement of the attack. Local bleeding is of most service, in treating acute inflammation, as an adjunct to tlie measures of a general kind. Blistering is most useful in chronic inflamma- tion, and ought never to be employed in other cases until by bleeding, or some other means, the power of action has been lessened. AH the other modes of couuter-iiTitating are most advantageous in, or rather entirely restricted to, chronic inflam- mation.PKINCIPI^ES OF SURGEEY. 28 Opiates and astringents are most beneficial, both externally and internally, wlien there is much' irritability, or tendency to act more than in proportion to the strength of the jDart or system. Resolution.—When the symptoms of inflammation subside, they do not leave the part affected altogether in its natural state. It generally remains for a time somewhat swelled, tender, and unfit for the performance of its duty, whence it requires rest, mechanical support, and gentle stimulation.29 MOKTiriCATION. CHAPTEE IT. MOETIFICATION. Symptoms of Mortification. When^inflammation, instead of terminating in a return to the natural ^^tion, goes on to the destruction of the part concerned, it is sarSTto terminate in Mortification. In this case, the part is not only deprived of sensation and voluntary motion, but is com- pletely divested of all vital properties, so that no opposition being any longer presented to the exercise of chemical attraction, putre- factive decomposition at once commences. The appearance of a mortified part varies with its texture, just as happens in putre- faction. The soft juicy tissues suffer most alteration, and the hard fibrous ones least. The former are reduced at once to the state of a fetid pulp, or hard leathery consistence, while the latter retain their distinctive characters for a much longer time. Another circumstance that affects the appearance of a mortified .part, is the degree of action which has preceded its death, since the softness and fetor will of course be greater if much fluid has been accumulated previously. This has led to the old-fashioned division of mortification into moist and dry. These terms have also been employed, with less propriety, to express the diflference which depends upon the disease being of internal or external origin; in other words, spontaneous, or the result of injury. The symptoms of mortification may be divided into those which precede its accomplishment, those exhibited by the mortified part, and those of the system which attend the local changes. The symptoms that precede acute mortification are, generally speaking, those indicative of intense inflammation. The redness30 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. is briglit and fiery, the paiu hot and burning, and the swelling tense. As mortification approaches, the swelling becomes less tense, and pits on pressure. The skin acquires a yellowish hue, and exhibits dark mottled spots or broad lines over its surface. The temperature of the part becomes lower ; and vesicles, con- taining a thin serous fluid of a yellow, green, or purple colour, which are named iMydmce, make their appearance. This state is called Gangrene, or gangrenous inflammation. The part is not dead, but only threatening to die, and may still admit of recovery, though a portion of it at least usually does perish. When the vital power is completely extinguished, the part ceases to be painful or sensible, shrinks in proportion to its previous distension, becomes black, brown, ash-gray, or buff-coloured, and emits a peculiar chara^eristic fetor, which is nearly the same whatever be the tissue ^icerned. It is then said to be sphace- lated, or to constitute a slough. The symptoms presented by the system, while these local changes are taking place, deserve great attention. They are nearly those which have been already described as attending sinkmg from excessive hemorrhage. The countenance is pale, cold, and moist; the features seem small and contracted; and the appearance exhibits that ill-omened aspect which has been designated the facics. Hippocratica; the pulse is quick, feeble, and irregular ; the tongue is brown ; and the lips frequently dis- play small dark-coloured scabs. The patient lies, on his back completely collapsed, or, as it were, sunk down into his bed ; he has frequent coffee-coloured vomiting, and suffers from almost incessant hiccup. His body emits a peculiar odour, somewhat like that of moist earth. He sometimes- retains his mental faculties entire ; but more frequently falls into a dozing state, alternated with low muttering delirium. The breathing becomes obstructed by mucous effusion, and death closes the scene. It is not easy to account for these constitutional s}Tnptdms. They have been attributed to the sphacelated part acting like a poison. But where sloiighing is induced directly by chemical or mechanical means, even to a great extent, it is not usuallyMOETIFICATION. 31 attended with tlie effects iii question. They have been also referred to the general exhaustion of power which the system suffers from the intense overaction that precedes the mortifica- tion. But this opinion is irreconcilable with the fact, that removal of the sphacelated part alleviates, and sometimes com- pletely arrests, the constitutional symptoms. They have, there- fore, as the only other explanation, been accounted for by sup- posing that the gangrenous or dying action extends itself over the system. Whatever be the true reason of the constitutional effect, there can be no doubt that it bears a direct proportion to the importance of the part affected, and the violence of the action which precedes the destruction of its vitality. In chiQnic^orjh^ gangrene, the local changes are of a similar kind, but slower progress, and less striking character. The con- stitutional symptoms, also, are milder in a proportionate degree ; and, indeed, not unfrequently altogether absent. Causes of Mortification. The causes of mortification, or circumstances which induce inflammation to terminate in it, may be referred to weakness, or defective powers of action ;—excessive irritability, or disposition to act; and excessive irritation, or excitement to act. Weakness.—The different tissues possess different powers of action. The tendons and shafts of the bones are very apt to die when inflamed—the cellular substance is less so—the skin still less—and the coats of the arteries least of all. The weakness wliich predisposes to mortification may also depend on general debility of the system. In the advanced stage of fevers, the slightest irritations are apt to occasion slougliing. In weakly children, exhaxxsted still further by disease, this effect is of course more certainly produced; whence blisters are dangerous applica- tions in such circumstances. Bad or defective food, and especi- ally the use of unsound rye, when subject to the morbid condition named Ergot, may cause such an unhealthy state of the system, that the slightest local irritation, or even inflammation occun-ing spontaneously, leads to extensive sloughing of the extremities.32 PRINCIPLES OF SURr.EUY. A part merely of the body may be rendered weaker than usual, so as to be more prone to mortification, and this in various ways. "When the principal artery of a limb is tied, there is no longer sufficient strength for carrying on the usual actions—the weakened part seems to make an effort to recover—heat, pain, swelling, with the other symptoms of inflammation, supervene, and, if they are the least excited by external circumstances, soon wear out the diminished power that remains. The arteries occasionally become obstructed spontaneously, and this probably gives rise to the mortification of the toes which not unfrequently happens in old people. The Gangrena Senilis, as it has been Jfemed, was so well de- scribed by Mr. Pott, that his name is gwrally connected with it. The disease is seldom met with befor?the age of sixty. It occiirs more frequently in males than females; and chiefly affects persons addicted to the pleasures of the table. It is usually preceded by uneasy feelings, sometimes amounting to intense pain, in the foot, which, at the same time, is observed to be more or less swelled. A brown or purple spot then shews it- self—most frequently in the neighbourhood of one of the nails, but it may be in the sole or on the instep ; the surrounding skin becomes red, hot, and distended ; the cuticle separates from the discoloured spot, and exposes the subjacent texture in the state of slough. The morbid process then either gradually advances until the patient sinks under it at the end of weeks or months, or gradually relaxes in severity, and, ceasing to extend, permits a cure to be accomplished in the way hereafter to be explained. It has generally been supposed that the cause of this disorder consists in a weakened condition of the foot, probably de- pending upon obstruction of its arteries, or ossification of their coats. Nearly the same effect is produced when the blood is pre- vented from returning through the veins by pressure or closure of them from other causes. The obstruction of one vein, even though the principal one of the limb, may not produce trouble- some consequences, occasioning mortification, but if the princi-MORTIFICATION. 33 pal artery be at the same time obstructed, death of the part is certainly induced. Defect of nervous energy also predisposes to mortification. People who are paralytic in the inferior extremities, are apt to have sloughing induced by slight bruises. When the principal nerve of a limb is cut or otherwise interrupted, a tendency to mortification is frequently observed at the extremity. Irritability or excessive disposition to act.—Weak parts are always irritable; and hence this cause of mortification is to a certain extent comprehended in the former one. But, indpen- dently of weakness, and in the most opposite state of part or constitution, there is frequently an excessive disposition to over- action. People who exceed in eating or drinking, or who do not take exercise in proportion to their food, are liable to this morbid disposition, which is also sometimes met with as an origiual peculiarity of constitution. Excessive irritation or excitement to act.—Generally speaking, while other things are equal, the violence of inflammation is directly in proportion to the irritation. Whence it follows, that severe injuries, or other great and continued irritations, are apt to occasion mortification. Thus there is no constitution able to resist mortification from the shattering of a limb, or the iniiltra- tion of urine into the cellular substance. Treatment of Mortification. The prevention of mortification requires the use of means proper for obviating the predisposing causes. If there is general weakness of the system from the use of improper food, or any other cause, it must be remedied by a more wholesome regunen, and, if necessary, supported in the meantime by the administra- tion of wine, spirits, and other stimuli of speedy operation. If any cause of local weakness exist in operation, it ought, if possible, to be removed ; and the part which is weakened should be protected from all excitement. If the principal artery of a limb, for instance, has been tied, or if the part has been weakened by exposure to intense cold, every sort of local stimulating ap- DPEINCrPLES OF SURGERY. 34 plication should be carefully avoided, while the system is at the same time protected from excitement. In the treatment of ganrjrena senilis, it was customary to prescribe large quantities of wine and spirits, with a corresponding allowance of animal jellies and other nutritious articles of diet, and to employ, under the title of hot or invigorating dressings, various articles of a stimulating nature. Under this treatment, the evil progresses ; and even the opium that is often used, in compliance with Mr. Pott's advice, fails either to afford relief from the pain, or to check the advance of the disease. It would appear, that, in this as on other occasions of deficient strength, depending upon local causes, while the power to act is lessened, the tendency to ex- citement is increased; and that, as cordials and stimulants cannot supply the vigour which is wanting, they merely increase the morbid disposition to inflammation. I have therefore ad- vised, on theoretical as well as on practical grounds, that the diet of patients labouring under this disease should be strictly of milk and farinaceous food; that they should be confined to the horizontal posture ; and that the part affected should be enveloped in a thin linseed-meal poultice of gentle temperature. The only addition to these means required, until the slough separates, is the use of muriate of morphia, in doses proportioned to the patient's sufferings. If, instead of weakness, the irritability depends on strong power of action, it ought to be lessened by bleeding, purging, tartrate of antimony, and tobacco injections. When the mortifi- \ cation is completed, the slough should be cut away so far as is practicable, without encroaching on the living parts, in order to diminish the fetor ; yeast poultices are sometimes used with this view, but they generally occasion uneasiness. The clilbride of lime or soda in solution, diluted nitrous acid, or the uru/uentum resinosum, with an equal quantity of oil Of turpentine, are less objectionable applications; but nothing answers so well as a poultice of some soft soothing substance, such as linseed meal. The extreme prostration of strength that accompanies the acute form of mortification, peremjitorily demands diligent sup-35 MOETmCATION. port from wine and spirits. When the mortification does not cease to extend^ it comes to he a question whether or no the surgeon ought to interfere with the knife. The objection to doing so is, that, although the constitutional symptoms may be alleviated for a time after the amputation, the patient is in general soon reduced to the same state by sloughing of the cut surface. The most prudent course seems to be a middle one— to abstain from amputation when the mortification depends upon an internal cause, or one that cannot be removed, and to operate when the cause is external or within reach. It does not follow from this rule, however, that amputation should always be per- formed when mortification of a limb ensues from external irrita- tion, since the most trivial injury is sufficient to induce it in an unhealthy subject. It is only when the violence of the action is fairly referrible to the local cause, without supposing constitu- tional defect, that the operation can be practised with propriety. Though the extent of mortification may not be defined, if it de- pends upon a cause which is limited in its operation, as a bruise, or the obstruction of an aii;ery at some ascertained part of its course, the propriety of amputation wiU be stm more manifest. In those cases where the mortification spontaneously ceases to extend, as when it has resulted from the exposure of a part to cold, it often becomes a question whether the process should be confided entirely to the power of the system, or be anticipated by amputation, in order to hasten recovery, and provide a better stump than could be expected if the bones were allowed to separate without any covering being provided for them. On the whole, it seems best to adopt a middle course, and avoid inter- ference unto, the soft parts are nearly detached, when they may be easily dissected a little upwards so as to expose the bone and allow it to be divided with a saw, or disarticulated sufficiently high to let the integuments meet over, and afford the necessary protection to its extremity. The discrimination between those cases of external injury in which the mortification is to remain local, and those in which it is to extend, requires no less experience than judgment ; and it36 rRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. appears not improbable that some, at least, of the cases in which amputation has been reported as successful, on account of spreading gangrene, were not really of the formidable nature supposed. For although the inflammation induced by a local injury may be extensively diffused over the limb, the mortifi- cation is frequently limited to the part directly concerned—as where the leg has been bruised by the wheel of a waggon—so that if amputation be performed in the early stage of such a case, it may have the appearance of limiting the gangrenous process, which, if left to itself, would probably not have extended any further. But there can be no doubt that, upon some oc- casions, the destructive action, when really spreading, has been prevented from pursuing its fatal course by timely amputation.EFFUSION. 37 CHAPTEE III. EFFUSION. Effmion of Serum. The action or process wliicli is denoted by the expression Effusion, consists in the separation of the serous, or fibrinous portion of the blood, and its discharge into some part of the body. Effusion is not necessarily preceded by inflammation, but is very frequently a consequence of it. It has already been re- marked, that a slight degree of effusion almost always attends inflammation. Serous effusion takes place chiefly into the interstices of the subcutaneous cellular texture, and into the cavities which are lined with serous membranes, as the pleura, or peritoneum, and the joints. In the former situation, it occasions a swelling of the part affected, which, unless inflammation exists, is colourless, and pits on pressure. This is (Edema or Anasarca. It occupies chiefly those parts which are most dependent, especially the inferior extremities and the scrotum, and changes its place with the position of the body. In the serous sacs it constitutes collections of fluid, which are named Dropsies. The fluid, both of oedema and dropsy, generally bears a close resemblance to, or rather seems identical with, the serum of the blood. Sometimes it is more limpid and colourless, tinged with blood or bile, more watery, or loaded with a larger proportion of albumen. Serous effusion is induced in the cellular texture and serous sacs by various circumstances. It is often observed distinctly as a consequence of inflammation, but in this case the serous sacs are chiefly concerned. It very frequently results from the venousPKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 38 circulation being impeded eitlier by the mere posture of the body, or obstruction of the vessels, or from disease of the heart or liver, or the presence of a tumour compressing the veins, of winch pregnancy frequently affords an example in causing oedema of the Umbs. It also by no means rarely occurs without either any previous excitement of the part, or obstruction of the venous circulation that can be observed, and seems to depend on weak- ness alone. This may happen in both situations, but most fre- quently occurs in the subcutaneous cellular texture of the inferior extremities, as may be seen in the course of most chronic diseases which terminate fatally. The means of preventing serous effusion is, of course, to obviate so far as possible the circumstances which occasion it. Inflammation should be treated on the principles which have been explained to make it terminate in resohition. If the circu- lation of the veins is not free, the impeding cause ought to be re- moved. If weakness threatens to occasion the effusion, it must be counteracted by means suited to the case, and especially by the use of bandaging, together with the horizontal posture. The cure of effusion is sometimes accomplished by simply puncturing the skin, or sac containing the fluid, and allowing it to flow out. But very generally, the vessels from which the effusion has proceeded continue their action, so as to renew and maintain it after such evacuation. It is therefore necessary to change the action of the vessels, and this is done by various means. Mere external pressure sometimes suffices, and is more powerful when preceded by the application of blisters or stimu- lating ointments and lotions, to the neighbouring skin. When signs of excited action continue along with the effusion, general and local bleeding may be proper, together with applications of a soothing nature; and on the principle of counter-irritation or metastasis, diuretics, diaphoretics, and purgatives are admin- istered. It is generally observed, that the effused fluid is more readily absorbed when it is seated in the cellular substance, than when it occupies a serous bag, provided the exciting cause has been removed. When the dropsical effusion is of small extentEFFUSION. 39 and superficially situated, particular operations are occasionally performed for its radical cure, as will be explained hereafter under the titles of Bursa? Mucosae, and Hydrocele, Effusion of Fihrine. When fibrine is effused, it presents the appearance of the ^ bnfiy coat, and is named Coagulable Lymph, This effusion happens most frequently in the same situations as that of the serous kind, but also occurs on the mucous surfaces, and in the interstices of tissues. When the lymph is thrown out upon a surface, it takes the form .^z.Z-'w^ of a crust or membrane,—and if not disturbed, is apt to become organised and vascular, so as to constitute a permanent structure. Adhesions are thus often effected between adjacent surfaces, as those of the pleura. When lymph is eflPused on a serous surface, there is generally more. or less serum also, which in this case is not limpid and colourless, but turbid, with flakes of lymph floating in it. If the patient survives so as to afford sufficient time for the purpose, the lymph, where adherent to the sides of the cavity, is organised into dense membranous structures, and the serum acquires the usual appearance of a dropsical fluid. The loose portions of lymph sometimes become indurated into masses of a tough consistence and yellow colour, which usually resemble each other in size and form, as may be seen not unfre- quently in bursse that have suffered from inflammation, Eifusion of lymph on a natiiral surface occurs almost always as a consequence of inflammation. It is also occasionally pro- duced by two surfaces of the same kind being pressed together, as may be seen in the blood-vessels, particularly the veins, or in the contents of a large hernia for which an imperfectly fitting truss has been worn. The means of prevention consist in sub- duing the inflammation that precedes ; and it may further be stated, that the constitutional disturbance produced by mercury seems much opposed to the action which occasions the effusion, whence the_use of that medicine in cases where injurious effects are threatened from this source, as in Iritis,PRINCIPLES OF SUKCrERY. 40 Lymph, like serum, is effused into tlie cellular interstices also, but in this case is not confined to the subcutaneous texture, and occurs with equal readiness in the constituent as in the connect- ing cellular substance of organs. If time be afforded, it becomes organized, so as to cause thickening and hardening of the part concerned. This effusion may occur as a consequence of inflammation, but much more frequently takes its rise from the immediate effect of local irritation, such as that produced by the passage of fluids through preternatural channels, or by the lodgment of foreign matters within the substance of the body, as when the urine escapes by a fistula in perinceo, or a bullet lies where it cannot be extracted. The result in these cases is thickening of the surrounding parts, or the formation of a capsule. This process is generally rather beneficial than injurious, as it limits the influence of the irritation, and prevents it from exciting a more violent or injurious action. Its effects generally disappear so soon as the cause that led to them is removed ; if they do not, the same means which promote the dispersion of oedema are re- qiiired—namely, pressure, with blistering, and stimulating oint- ments. Ljmiph is also effased on the surfaces of wounds, and some- times unites them, so as to remedy at once the solution of con- tinuity. This process is named Union by the first Intention. The steps by which it is accomplished, and the circumstances that oppose and favour its completion, are extremely important. Every wound is attended with more or less bleeding ; and as it gradually ceases, an exudation of serum takes place, which is readily recognised by the faint-coloured stain it makes on the dressings. Trom eight to twelve hours after the wound is in- flicted, less or more according to its extent, this discharge ceases, when lymph is effused from the cut surfaces, and if they are in contact, or nearly so, glues them together—becoming gradually organized, and completing the union from forty-eight to seventy- two hours after the injury has been sustained. The union, though now perfect, so far as regards appearance and feehng,41 EFFUSION. does not possess mucli mechanical strength ; and if the lips of the "Wound be torn asunder, they are found to have a coating of coagulable lymph on each of the respective surfaces, precisely similar to that wliich is effused upon serous membranes as a consequence of inflammation. Inflammation, therefore^ used to be considered essential to this mode of union, which was said to be effected by Adhesive Inflammation. It is now ascertained that inflammation, so far from being essential to the process, is subversive of it. A certain degree of excitement is not in- compatible ; but whenever it goes so far as to occasion pain, or much swelling and redness, union by the first intention is frus- trated : and the way is led to another process of reparation here- after to be described, viz., Granulation. Inflammation being thus preventive of primary union, and the interposition of any foreign substance, or the separation of the cut surfaces, beyond the extent to which they can be glued together by the thin layer of lymph effused from each, being of course no less adverse to the process, it follows that the plan which used to be followed in dressing wounds should be re- garded as equally injudicious and injurious. It consisted in closing them immediately, or soon after their infliction, and retaining their Kps in accurate contact by adhesive plasters, or other means, pledgets of ointment and bandages being applied— and no change made in the dressing till the foui'th day. The consequences were that the blood and serum being confined, the edges of the wound were separated from each other ; and the stimulus of necessity, as John Hunter called it, or irritation pro- duced by the continuance of a breach in the structure of the body, which, if primary union had occurred, would have ceased to exist, caused inflammation as the first step to the other mode of reparation already mentioned. Two insuperable obstacles, either of which would have been sufficient for the purpose, were thus placed in the way of direct adhesion—viz., separation of the raw surfaces, and inflammatory action; and when the wound was at length undressed, instead of being united, it was found distended into a cavity filled with matter.42 PBINCIPLES OF SURGERY. It is much more consonant with reason, and will be found much more successful in practice, to close the lips of the wound only partially, or not at all, for ten or twelve hours, until the bloody and serous oozing shall have ceased, and then to place them in the most exact possible contact, at the same time taking care to prevent or allay excited action by cold applications and suitable regimen. If the wound is so situated that its edges can be kept in contact merely by the firm application of dry lint, which does not oppose the sanguineous or serous discharge, it may at once be dressed in this way without any inconve- nience, and with the advantage of saving future trouble. In the year 1825, I published an essay in the Edinhtrgh Medical and Surgical Joiornal, recommending this mode of treating wounds, and I am happy to observe that it has gradually come into use, even with those who at first most strenuously opposed it.ABSORPTION, 43 CHAPTEE IV. ABSORPTION. By Absoi-ption is understood an excess in the action of removal over that of deposition by the nutrient vessels. The effect of this is necessarily a diminution in the bulk of the part con- cerned, which may be either of the surface or the substance. Absorption, therefore, is distinguished into superficial or ulcera- tive, and interstitial. It may occur in both situations as a consequence of inflam- mation merely, without reference to the exciting cause; but much more frequently depends upon some peculiarity of local irritation, which either occasions it directly, or indirectly through the intervention of inflammation. The most common exciting causes of absorption are pressure, and the presence of something not naturally existing in the body. It frequently removes fluids effused into the interstices and cavi- ties, and when inadequate to effect this, generally opens a passage for their escape externally, by removing the parietes containing them to such extent as is necessary for effecting an aperture. Foreign bodies which excite more irritation than what is suffi- cient for causing the effusion and organization of lymph around them, very frequently obtain their discharge by a similar process of interstitial absorption. It is important to notice, that, though the pressure or uTitation excited by the foreign matter, one would suppose, must be equal on all sides,—the absorbing action always takes place in the direction of the nearest external sur- face, unless an internal one lined with mucous membrane should be very near, when the process proceeds towards it. It is by ulcerative absorption of the surrounding living tissues that sloughs are detached.44 PEINCIPLES OF SURGEUY. The means wMch may be employed for inducing absorption, are pressure, stimulating lotions, such as those containing vine- gar, spirits, and muriate of ammonia, blistering ointments, and liniments containing mercury and iodine,—also the internal use of the two last-mentioned medicines, in various forms.45 GRANULATION. CHAPTEE V. GKANULATION. Effects of the Granulating Action^ The term Granulation is applied to an action, which repairs breaches in the continuity of the surface that are not healed by primary union. Such breaches may be caused either by violence or absorption, and m both cases are named Ulcers. An ulcer may be defined to be a solution of continuity in a natural sur- face, secreting matter. , \ When a wound does not heal by the first intention, it begins about twenty-four hours after the injury has been sustained to be painful, and attended with the other symptoms of inflamma- tion. A thin serous discharge oozes out from it, and by and by the surface acquires a uniform appearance, whatever be the tissues which compose it, owing to an effusion of IjTuph that seals up the interstices of the cellular substance, and forms a thin superficial covering. About the third day, sooner or later, according to the activity of action, the incrustation of lymph becomes organized, — it acquires a red colour, bleeds when touched, and before many days have elapsed, shoots up into small granvdar projections, whence the process is named. These granulations are small, pointed, firm, and vascular,—they are covered with a fine pellicle, and secrete a peculiar straw-coloured fluid named Pus, the properties of which will be more particu- larly described hereafter. The wound is now, properly speaking, an ulcer, and the sub- sequent process of healing is the same as in ulcers caused by absoi-ption. The inequality of surface, if any existed, gradually disappears, the bottom of the ulcer becomes regularly concave,PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 46 and at length there ceases to be any difference of level between it and the surrounding parts. WhUe these changes are taking place, the extent of the breach is daily diminishing, by a general contraction of the surface. Then a fine blue pellicle is observed at the edge, which increases in breadth, and at last covers the small remnant of the ulcer that is not closed by the contraction just mentioned. This new-formed skin is named the Cicatrix ; which is, of course, smaller in extent than the original breach of continuity. At fixst it is blue or purple, and very vascular, but aftenvards it ceases to be so, and becomes dense, white, and bloodless, at the same time contracting still further. Nature of the Granulating Action. It is generally believed that the granulations grow up above each other by the effusion and organization of lymph in successive layers, until the cavity is filled to the proper level. That then the thin peUicle on the surface begins to be thickened and formed into skin at the circumference of the ulcer, while the granulations below shrink, owing to absorption of their constituent substance, and draw the edges of the breach together. There can be no doirbt, however, that this opinion rests on inaccurate observation, and is quite incorrect. The subject was carefully investigated by the French Academy of Surgeiy; and the essays of Louis, Fabre, Pibrac, etc., leave hardly anything to be desired for its elucidation. They shewed that there is never any real reproduc- tion of lost parts, with the exception of bone, which in some circumstances is regenerated. The skin also ought, perhaps, to be excepted; bnt the difference as to appearance and properties between the substance that constitutes a cicatrix, and the ordi- nary integument of the body, would rather lead us to regard this structure as a new formation. In aU other cases it will be invariably found, that when the cure is completed there either remains a depression corresponding to the loss of substance, or such a contraction of the neighbouring parts as compensates for the want. The first step in the healing of an ulcer seems to be sub-47 GRANULATION. sidence of the suiToundiug swelling, if any exists; and then a gradual emaciation, chieily of the fatty, but also of the other tissues concerned, so as to render the skin more lax and easily drawn together. Hence it is that the cicatrix when first formed appears to be on a level with the neighbouring surface, though there may have been a loss of substance to a considerable depth. After the cure is completed, the usual plumpness returns, and ^ the cicatrix will then be found depressed. Ulcers being thus healed by contraction, and not by any. new production except what forms the cicatrix, the reason appears why their cure is accomplished more readily in parts that are lax, than in. those which are comparatively fixed from adhering to the subjacent bones. The sore which remains after the removal of nearly the whole scrotum by slougliing or operation readily heals, with a very small cicatrix ; while injuries of the scalp attended with loss of substance are repaired very slowly, and with a consider- able depression at the part. The old stories of regeneration following removal of the lip for cancer, and destruction of the (jlans penis by sloughing, when inquired into and stripped of theu- exaggerations, are found to admit of easy explanation. In the former case, it is apt to appear that the disease occupies a larger extent of the part affected than it really does, from the morbid growth taking the place of, and pressing aside, the sound textures. Hence the whole lip may seem to be involved and taken away by operation, while, in fact, a comparatively small portion only has been removed, and the remainder is ready to stretch out when its surface is drawn together by the gxanulating action, and thus, in a great measure, supply the loss of substance. Something of a similar description occurs in sloughing of the. tongue or glans 2?e7ws,—the swelling which attends the preceding inflammation making the part concerned appear much larger tlian it really is, so that, though the destruction is only partial, it may be thought complete. On all occasions, when a sore heals by the gi-anulating process, there is great risk of supposing that the cavity is filling up, while, in ti'uth, the bottom remains at the same level, and appears to rise from the sun-ounding skin de-48 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. scending towards it, just as the banks of a river seein to glide past tlie observer, who is carried smoothly on by the current. The best evidence as to this is afforded by sores seated over bones or other fixed points, between which and the surface of the granulations the distance is not found to increase. In the old way of performing amputation, by cutting all the parts of the limb nearly on the same level, a large granidating surface re- sulted, which, if successive layers of organized structure were really formed by it, should have grown out into a bulbous shape. But, instead of this, it is well known that just the opposite con- dition took place, and that the surrounding skin was drawn in a puckered form closely round the bone. In short, the healing of an ulcer should be regarded as an action not of effusion or new formation, but of absorption or contraction; and it will be found, on considering the treatment of ulcers, that whatever causes swelling of the part concerned impedes, whUe everything pro- ductive of an opposite effect tends to hasten, the progress of recovery. When an ulcer is examined by dissection, the cellular sub- stance lying under and around its base is found more or less infiltrated and condensed with lymph; but the granular cover- ing is very thin, being limited to the crust effused in the first instance, and subsequently organized. The texture under the thin pellicle of the granulations is liable to be distended with blood or serum, which occasions a state similar to oedema, and elevates the surface of the ulcer so as to present the appearance which is commonly named proud flesh. Morbid nutrition may occur in the same situation, and then growths of various size, form, and appearance, spring up ; but these, so far from having any share in the process of cure, tend to delay or entirely prevent it. It may be asked, why should not the natural structures be regenerated, if diseased ones are thus formed ? But it should be recollected, that all we know of the laws of nature is learned from observation; and mere analogy, in opposition to weU- ascertained facts, affords no reason to expect any reproduction of lost parts in the human subject. There are other cii'cumstancesGRi\J«JLATION. 49 under wliich regeneration takes place more readily—tliat is, when the parts concerned do not communicate with a breach in the surface of the body. An interstitial process then goes forwards, consisting of the effusion and organization of Ijanph, which freqiiently forms a substitute, nearly or altogether similar to the original texture. The nen'-es, tendons, periosteum, bones, and ligaments, are thus frequently restored, after suffering more or less extensive destruction. Treatment of Ulcers tending to Heal. So long as the granulating process proceeds, as has been de- scribed, it requires no local treatment, except what is necessary to prevent it from being disturbed by external irritation. Great attention to cleanliness ought to be observed with regard to the parts surrounding the sore, which should be frequently washed, and shaved if there are. any hairs upon them. There is no iise or propriety in scrubbing the surface of the ulcer itself, as is frequently done, since the pus affords a natural covering to protect it, and would be sufficient for the purpose, if it were not that the risk of injur}'' from contact with external bodies, and the unseemliness of an ulcer exposed to view, require some artificial covering. Old linen, lint, or chai-pie, may be employed for this purpose; and perhaps the last-mentioned article is the best, as, being more porous, it allows the pus to pass readily througli its interstices. Whatever be the covering employed, it should be moistened with water, and prevented from drying by a piece of oiled silk, or thin gutta percha, laid over it. The ulcer requires to be dressed frequently, in proportion to the quantity of dis- charge. Once in the twenty-four hours is generally sufficient, but twice is often necessary—and sometimes the interval may be extended to two days or more. One granulating surface may unite with another, when they are placed in contact, and retained together. The cure is thus sometimes greatly abridged, and at other times very troublesome adhesions may result, as when the respective surfaces of the fingers are ulcerated from any cause. E50 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEUY. Treatment of Contractions caused hy Cicatrisation. When the ulcerated surface is extensive, and the integuments surrounding it are easily drawn together, as is the case after burns of the throat, great deformity and inconvenience are fre- quently occasioned by the contracting effect of the granulating action, rendering the cicatrix so small as to keep the parts about it permanently displaced and immovable. Mere division of the contraction is hardly ever sufficient to remedy the evil, as the firmness of the cicatrix prevents the edges of the cut from being separated much, and any relaxation thus gained is almost always lost during the subsequent cicatrisation. An ingenious method of treatment was proposed by Mr. Earle,—namely, to cut out the cicatrix entirely, and then unite the edges of the wound laterally, if possible, by the first intention, but, at all events, so as to pre- vent contraction in the longitudinal dii'ection. In favourable circumstances for its performance, this operation answers ex- tremely 'WeU, but these are unfortunately seldom met with; and it is obvious, that if the cicatrix be broad, or of much extent in proportion to the size of the part affected, no benefit could be de- rived from its excision. It is an important fact, that the cicatrix, while still recent and vascular, may be extended by mechanical force cautiously and perseveringly employed, since deformities from contraction may thus be not only prevented but some- times completely remedied. In the case of a girl, whose fore-arm, in consequence of a burn, was drawn up almost close to the arm, a complete cure was effected by one of my pupUs, in the course of a few weeks, through the use of an iron wire splint, fitted to the shape of the contracted limb, and gradually expanded. Treatment of Ulcers not tending to Heal. Ulcers are prevented from healing by many different circum- stances, which have led to a variety of complicated classifications for their arrangement. As the effect of these has generally been to peiplex instead of simplifying the subject, it seems better to51 GRANULATION. adopt an easier system; and the three following heads will be found to comprehend the whole :— 1. Ulcers which are prevented from healing by defect of action. 2. Ulcers which are prevented from healing by excess of action. 3. Ulcers which are prevented from healing by peculiarity of action. The cii'cumstance which has occasioned the ulcer, the part of the body in which it is situated, or the peculiarities of the patient's system, sometimes at once denote its nature ; but in general this can be learned best by carefully examining the di^ tinctive features that are presented, in respect—1. To the surface^ of the ulcer, which may be level with the surrounding skin, depressed below it, or elevated above it, concave, smooth, or irregular ; 2. The shape of its edges, which may be regularly curved and smooth, or eroded and angular, round or sharp, undermined and inverted, or thick and everted; 3. The quantity or quality of its discharge, which may be purulent, bloody, or serous, thick or thin, copious or scanty, fetid or inodorous; 4. The kind and degree of the pain proceeding from it; 5. The con- dition of the surrounding and subjacent parts, which may be hard or soft, inflamed or natural; and, 6. The mode of its cica- trisation, which may proceed from the circumference to the centre, or from the centre towards the cu'cumference,—on a level with the surrounding surface, elevated above, or depressed below it. Ulcers prevented from Healing ly Defect of A ction. The defect of action has been thought to depend sometimes upon a real want of power, and at others upon a want of dispo- sition to exert the power that exists. The ulcers of this kind have accordingly been divided into Weak, and Indolent or Callous, which exhibit different characters, and requke different treatment. In Weak Ulcers the surface is generally higher than that ofPRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY the surrounding skin, and exhibits large flabby granulations, which are either of a dark colour, like that of venous blood, or pale and cedematous. The edge is smooth and flat, or gently rounded; the discharge thin, watery, and generally profuse ; the pain usually inconsiderable. The parts surrounding and sub- jacent, constituting what is called the stool or base of the ulcer, are soft and free from any indurating effusion. The cicatrix forms round the margin, and is generally at first elevated above the proper level, to which it usually descends afterwards, owing to the contraction that takes place subsequently to its completion. This kind of ulcer occurs in parts which possess weak powers of action, either on their own account or on that of the system. The general wealcness is most frequently observed in children ; but may be induced at any age, by deficient nourishment, an unwholesome atmosphere, etc. The local weakness may depend on the cause which occasioned the ulcer, or simply on the long duration of the healing process. With regard to the first of these, it may be stated, that whenever the solution of continuity is effected by means which injure the parts concerned, as by lacerating, bruising, or burning, it displays the characters of a weak ulcer; and, as to the second, it is sufficient to observe, that every ulcer tends to become defective in action during the process of cure ; so that, if considerable in size, it is sure, sooner or later, to display the features indicative of this condition. The treatment of weak ulcers consists in employing pressure, together with stimulating and astringent applications locally ; and, if necessary, strengthening the system by the administration of wine, bark, bitters, and nourishing diet. Of the local applica- tions, ointments used to be most employed; but the preference is now generally given to various metallic solutions, such as those of the sulphate of zinc, acetate of lead, and sulphate of copper, in the proportion of from one to three grains to the ounce. It seems probable that the moist nature of these appli- cations is of more consequence, in producing the effect desired, than the substances dissolved in them, since water alone answers very well for the purpose. These lotions or washes, as they are53 GRANULATION. called, onglit to be varied occasionally, as habit lessens their effect. Pressure is always useful, and ought to be exerted by proper bandages. Several folds of moistened lint should be laid over the sore; and between the lint and bandage it is proper to interpose a piece of oiled silk, to prevent the lotion from soaking away and leaving the sore dry. The Indolent or Callous Ulcer is distinguished by a smooth siu'face, generally depressed, of various colours, brown, gray, or white, having no appearance of gTanulations, and looking as if varnished; a viscid tenacious fetid discharge ; a circular or oval figure, Avith little irregularity; and thick white edges, seeming as if composed of accumulated cuticle. There is no circum- scribed hardness in the immediate neighbourhood of the ulcer; but there is always diffused swelling of the limb in which it is seated. The swelling is not soft and yielding lilce that of com- mon cedema, but firm and incompressible. The pain is very variable. There is no appearance of cicatrix so long as the sore retains its indolent characters. Ulcers of this description are confined almost exclusively to the legs of people advanced beyond middle age, and constitute a veiy troublesome subject of surgical practice, as they are very apt to recur after being healed. Some people, partly from the fear of injuring the system by suppressing a long-continued dis- charge, and partly from the despair of effecting a permanent cure, bestow little care on the treatment of these complaints ; but this is wrong, since the most unpromising cases, under pro- per management, are often remedied; and there is hardly any disease which interferes more seriously with the patient's com- fort, or unfits him more for the active duties of life. This kind of sore is chiefly met with in the labouring poor, and often pro- duces the greatest misery, by impeding or altogether preventing the exertions which are required for maintaining the patient and his family. Tlie treatment generally thought the most useful, is rest in the horizontal posture, conjoined with pressure. The merit of fully establishing the advantage of pressure is due to Messrs.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 54 Whately and Baynton, the former of whom recommended a calico or flannel bandage, to be tightly applied from the toes upwards to the knee ; and the latter, in addition to this means, to make the compression more effectual, employed straps of adhesive plaster, an iuch .or two broad, and long enough not only to encircle the limb, but to cross each other far enough to obtain a firm hold when drawn round the leg, and across the sore. The limb having been shaved, a slip of plaster is applied an inch or two below the sore; then another a little further up, so as to leave a third of the former one exposed; then another in the same way ; and so on, until not only the ulcer, but an inch of the skia above it is covered. Lastly, a cotton roUer, three inches broad, and five yards long, is applied from the toes upwards. Unless the discharge is profuse, the sore need not be dressed oftener than once in two days. Under this treatment the swell- ing of the limb subsides—the callous edges speedily disappear— the surface of the idcer granulates, discharges a purulent secre- tion, and cicatrises as an ordinary healing sore. The good effects of this treatment are usually ascribed to its stimulating the actions, which are supposed to be in an indolent state, and I thus exciting a healing action in the sore. But the true explaua- I tion probably is, that it allows the healing action to proceed, by I inducing an absorption of the swelling which occupies the limb, and which, though of secondary origin, inasmuch as it proceeds from the continued initation of the ulcer, when once estab- lished, must oppose the contraction requisite for the process of cicatrisation. I have accordingly found that the application of a large blister, covering the sore and a considerable part of the limb, greatly hastens the cure, and generally proves sufficient for its completion, without the use of any other means. The immediate effect of this practice is removal of the swelling, so that the thick callous edges disappear, and the surface of the ulcer coming to be on a level with the surrounding skin, granulates and cicatrises. In favour of this treatment I may mention, that it is more speedy and lasting in its effects than the strapping process—and muchGRANULATION. 55 more economical, wliicli is a point of great importance in treating tlie poor people who usually suffer from the disease—since the expense of strapping and bandaging their limbs very often pre- vents the treatment from being undertaken. Ulcers prevented from Healing ly Excess of Action. These ulcers have an irritable look, owing to redness of their own surface and that of the surrounding skin. In general they are deep, of a brownish-red colour, and shew no granulations— they are irregular in shape—their edges are abrupt and usually ragged—^their discharge is thin, serous, and often tinged with blood. Sometimes they are superficial—of a regular circular form—and exhibit no redness except a bright line at their mar- gin. The paia attending them is almost always acute. They form no cicatrix so long as they retain the irritable characters. Irritable or over-acting ulcers are met with in full overfed sub- jects, who possess strong powers of action, and in weak irritable individuals. They may also- occur merely as the effect of con- tinued irritation, whether direct or indirect. The treatment consists in removing all sources of irritation, and using local applications which have a sootlnng tendency. Of these, heat and moisture, as afforded by fomentations and poultices, are the best; and their effects may be increased by using decoctions of poppy heads, solution of acetate of lead with opium, etc. Scarification of the edges of the ulcer, or leeches, may also be employed if the symptoms are severe, but it is very seldom necessary to do so. Bleeding, purging, calomel, and opium, must also be resorted to according to the state of the system, so as to reduce excessive power of action and allay inordinate irritability. In relieving the ulcer from irritation it should be recollected, that motion has a powerful effect in causing or increasing it, and rest therefore ought to be strictly enforced. Ulcers of this kind sometimes go on progressively enlarging, and are then said to be Phagedenic. Wlaen the over-action runs stUl higher, so as to destroy the life of the part, it constitutes56 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. what is called a Sloughing Ulcer. Wlien mercury was given profusely aud indiscriminately, in the treatment of venereal affections, it frequently indiiced such irritability as to make the sore assume phagedenic or sloughing characters. The patients in crowded ill-ventilated hospitals sometimes suffer from slough- ing of their sores, attended with great destruction of the parts, or even fatal effects on the system. This Hospital Gangrene, as it is named, no doubt depends on the unwholesome atmosphere exciting preternatural irritability, and the treatment, therefore, essentially requires removal from the sphere of this deleterious infliience. Other means will hardly be required if this be afforded, while the most careful administration of dressings and medicines will be of little avail so long as the grand desideratum is withheld. The age, strength, and previous circumstances of the patient may render it proper to vary the subordinate treat- ment by bleeding or stimidating, fomenting or cauterising. The hospital gangrene, as described by mOitaiy surgeons, is not met with in civil hospitals to such a formidable extent; but a degree of the same effect, ]n"oceediag from a similar cause, is of frequent occtxrrence, and demands similar measures for its remedy. In the forms of this affection which I was accustomed to see in former days, when the accommodation for surgical patients in the Eoyal Infirmary of this city was not sufficiently extensive, the first sign of its commencement was the appearance of one or more small supeirficial circular excavations, looking as if scooped out from the surface of the sore. They had a yellow or grayish-yellow colour, and were devoid of granulations. Eapidly extending and coalescing, they entirely altered the aspect of the ulcer, which, at the same time, partly from swelling of its edges, and also from phagedenic action, became much increased in extent. A soft spongy slough of a dirty white colour next pre- sented itself, generally extending over the whole surface, but varying in thickness. While these local changes were in pro- gress, and apparently keeping pace with them, a general derange- ment of the patient's system was observed. He acquired a sickly yellow aspect, lost his sleep and appetite, and had an extremely57 GRANUIiATION, quick piilse, together with the foul tongue and all the other symptoms of feverish disturbance. By and by, in the course of a week or ten days, the state of matters usually began to improve; the sore gradually regained its former characters, and, though often very much increased in size, healed more quicldy than might have been expected, the general health undergoing a corresponding change. After trying a great variety of treatment without any sensible benefit, I came to regard the attack as one that should be trusted very much to spontaneous recovery. It was more troublesome than dangerous ; even in the cases of compound fracture and amputation, hardly, if ever, leading to the loss of limb or life, but merely protracting the cure. A poultice seemed the best dressing that could be applied until the sloughs began to separate, and the only internal remedies that appeared useful were laxatives in the early stage to regulate the bowels, and a moderate allowance of wine in the more advanced period of the complaint. ■ The application of concentrated nitric ncid has been thought useful in checking the unhealthy action. Ulcers prevented from Healing hy Peculiarity of A ction. It was formerly supposed that all the ulcers which resisted the means of increasing and diminishing action, owed their obstinacy to peculiarity of disposition, whence they were named specific sores. It is now well ascertained that a very large proportion of these sorcalled^ specific ulcers^ depend on some irritation, direct or indirect, after the removal of which they readily heal. The most common cause of irritation in such cases is that pro- ceeding from suppression of the secretions, especially those of the digestive organs, the remedy of which consists in correcting the patient's errors in regimen, and subjecting him to an altera- tive course of medicine. For this purpose, nothing answers so well, in general, as restricting the diet, increasing the exercise, and prescribing daily doses of the carbonate of soda with rhubarb,—as half a di-achm of the former, and six grains of the latter. The local treatment must be regidatcd by the condition of the ulcer as to excess or defect of action, but, generally58 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, speaking, lotions answer best, and of these the black wash, which is formed by decomposing calomel with lime water in the proportion of eight or ten grains to the ounce, and a weak solu- tion of sulphate of copper, are the most useful. Ulcers depending on the suppression of other habitual dis- charges, such as the menstrual, should be treated on the same principle, the particular means employed being varied according to the circumstances of the case. When an ulcer continues to exist without any local or con- stitutional irritation to account for its doing so, the obstinacy may then be fairly referred to peculiarity of action. This morbid disposition is either confined to the ulcer, or exists generally throughout the system. Specific ulcers may accordingly be divided into Constitutional and Local. Specific Ulcers present every variety of character. Their colour is usually gray, yellow, or purple; their surface is some- times deeply excavated, at other times elevated into fimgous gro^vths, presenting a sort of cauliflower appearance. Their discharges vary without limit as to colour, consistence, and quantity. The pain attending them is also very variable. The cicatrix exhibits various peculiarities in the mode of its forma- tion, often commencing in the centre or at one side, and shooting over the remainder of the area—or going on at one part wliile the ulcer extends at another—and being in general considerably depressed below the surrounding surface, but not unfrequently elevated into projections above it. The treatment varies with the nature of the general or local disposition which maintains the ulcer. If it appears that the patient's system has been disordered by mercury, the best means of promoting recovery is blistering of the sore surface, with the internal use of the iodide of potassium in small doses. When the ulcer resists every means employed to induce a healing action, it is generally named a Cancer, the only remedy for which is extirpation. This may be effected by caustics, the ligature, and the knife. The first-mentioned means are proper where the sore is of no great depth, or of much extent; the4 GKANULATION. 59 second where hemorrhage might be profuse, and could not be easily restrained; while the third, or excision, is the easiest, least painful, and most certain method in the great majority of cases. The division of cancer into local or epithelial and general, which has been attempted, seems to rest upon a differ- ence of degree rather than of kind, since every shade of liabihty to return after removal may be observed, between the total absence of any such disposition, and complete infection of the whole system. The different morbid dispositions which have now been con- sidered may exist together, so as to comjjlicate the appearance and treatment of ulcers. An indolent ulcer of the leg, by in- temperate living and the excitement of motion, frequently, in addition to its own characters, presents some of those which depend on irritation, such as redness and pain. These subside under the influence of poultices and rest, so as to leave the indolent characters alone. Specific ulcers shew every variety of imder-acting and over-acting characters, according to their particular circumstances, and consequently require a variety of treatment besides that which their peculiar nature demands.riUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. GO CHAPTER VL SUPPURATION. SuppuRiVTiON consists in the formation of a peculiar fluid named I'us, which possesses the following characters :—It has nearly the consistence of cream ; it has a pale yellow or straw colour ; \^ it occasions no smell while cold, but when heated to the tempe- rature of the body emits a faint odour ; it is opaque, and when examined by the microscope, appears to be composed of globules suspended in a transparent fl.uid; it sinks in water ; it is coagu- ^ latcd by muriate of ammonia; and sometimes has its fluidity diminished, merely by removal from the body. It was formerly believed that pus originated from putrefac- tion or degeneration of the blood and other fl.uid or solid parts ; and a loss of substance or breach in the continuity of the solids was thought essential to its formation. It is now ascertained A that pus is produced by a peculiar secreting action of the capil- lary vessels, wliich may occur without any solution of continuity. The mucous membranes, after being inflamed, frequently take on the suppurative action ; and the purulent secretion of granula- tions may be quoted as another instance, since the pus is dis- charged here at once from the vessels. A gi'anulating surface in several respects bears much resemblance to a mucous membrane, and may be regarded as a temporary covering instead of skin. Pus varies very much in consistence, colour, and other properties, from admixture of blood, the nature of the part, or the consti- tution of the patient. Suppuration may be divided into superficial and interstitial.SUPPURATION. 61 Siiperficial Suppiiration. Superficial suppuration is that which takes place from the surface of the mucous membranes, as the urethra or conjunctiva. It was not admitted by the older surgeons, who accounted for the discharge in such cases either by calling it mucus, or by referring it to some solution of continuity out of sight. Purulent discharge fi'om a surface, or a running, as it is gene- rally named, is in the first instance accompanied with symptoms of the inflammatory action which preceded it, particularly heat and redness, which require measures of a soothing kind, such as bleeding, purging, warm fomentations, etc. By and by these subside, and the discharge alone continues, when the treatment must be altered to the use of stimulating and astringent appli- cations, such as metallic washes, ointments, etc. Interstitial Suppuration. When suppuration takes place within the texture of the body, there results a collection of pus, which is named an Ab- scess. The matter sometimes is diffused through the interstices of the cellular texture; bu.t more frequently is contained in a circumscribed cavity, which is limited by the effusion of lymph, forming a sort of capsule or containing bag. When inflammation terminates in the formation of an ab- scess, the pain loses its intensity, and changes to a throbbing sensation. The tension also diminishes, but the swelling does not subside; on the contrary, it rather becomes more prominent; and when pressed upon by the fingers gives the feeling of a fluid contained in a bag, which is called Fluctuation. The particles of a fluid being equally movable in all directions, when pressure is made at one part, an impulse is necessarily communicated over the whole surface ; and if the fingers be placed at different points, the extent of the cavity may be ascertained. Wlien the collection of matter is small, or thickly covered, a very nice and practised sense of touch, the tadus eruditus, is requisite for recognising fluctuation. If the abscess, on the other hand, bePRINCIPLES OP SUKGERY. 62 very large, simple percussion at one point is sufficient to detect it, Wlieu the suppuration is extensive, or seated in any im- portant region of the body, such as the joints or cavities of the trunk, its commencement and progress are usually attended with rigors of various degrees and duration. It has been questioned whether or not suppuration may occur without being preceded by inflammation. There can be no doubt that the symptoms of over-action previously are often very slight, and they probably ought not to be regarded as essential; but in the great majority of cases, suppuration certainly is a consequence of inflammation. The contents of an abscess may be removed by the powers of the system in two ways. They are sometimes simply absorbed into the mass of circulating fluids. This happens most fre- quently in the case of abscesses connected with the periosteum and lymphatic glands, as those of the groin ; and it is worthy of notice, tliat, when such absorption takes place, no bad symptoms follow. It is now generally believed, that when pus is formed within reach of the cavities of vessels, as in a recent wound where the effusion of lymph is imperfect, or within the interior of veins, so that it may enter the circulation without passing tlu'ough the modifying operation of the capillaries —a portion is apt to gain admission, and, preserving its characters so as to be distinguishable by the microscope, become the source of purulent deposits in other parts of the body. Another, and in my opinion much more probable explanation of such secondary purulent de- posits, as they are called, is, that, in certain local suppurations, the whole mass of circulating blood sustains an alteration in its condition predisposing it to secrete pus; just as during inflam- matory fevers, while lymph is thrown out from the capillaries, it separates more readily than usual from the blood during coagu- lation, and presents the buffy coat. As the globules of the blood and pus differ but slightly from each other, it is easy to conceive that some slight change, attending tliis morbid condition, may occasion the appearance which has been thought to denote the presence of pus in the blood. Much more frequently the pressureSUPPURATION. 63 of the matter causes absorption of the surrounding parts, and, in conformity with the general law that those yield to it most readily which lie nearest the surface, the covering of the abscess becomes thinner and thinner, so that the sldn alone remaining, it projects from the distension of the fluid, and becomes so thin as to allow the colour of the pus to be perceived through it. The abscess is then said to point, and soon afterwards, the absorption stiU continuing, an aperture takes place, which allows the con- , tents to escape. A discharge of matter issues from the opening for some time afterwards, but gradually becomes thinner, and diminishes in quantity until the cavity is healed. It is generally stated that this process of cure depends on a growth of granulations from the whole surface of the cavity, which is thus gradually filled up. But if this were the case, it is plain that there ought to be a permanent solid enlargement of the part concerned; for pus does not proceed from the breaking down or softening of the natural tissues, as was formerly sup- posed, and is merely secreted by the vessels into the interstices between them. It separates 'the muscles, condenses the celliilar texture, and elevates the skin, so as to obtain room for its recep- tion ; but so soon as vent is afforded for its escape, all the parts that have been pressed aside resume their natural situation, the cavity of the abscess is thus at once greatly diminished, and the contracting effect of the granulating action which ensues upon . its surface completes its obb'teration. Instead of waiting for the natural evacuation of abscesses, it is usual to make an artificial opening, in order to hasten the cure. This ought not to be done in general until the flu.ctuation is dis- tinct, especially if the abscess be seated in a glandular texture, as the process of reparation is otherwise apt to be rendered slow and imperfect. On the other hand, if the abscess is left entirely to itself, the skin frequently becomes so thin and impoverished at the part where it points, as not to possess sufficient power of action for uniting with the subjacent surface, and requires to be divided to this extent, so that the patient suffers much more than he would have done if the abscess had been opened.Gi PRINCIPLES OF SURGHRY. When the patient is in great suffering—when there is reason to believe that the matter is forming under some thick fascia, or other covering that resists its progress to the surface—or when the matter appears to be diffused in the cellular substance—it is improper to wait for pointing, and it is impossible to make an opening too early. When the suppuration takes place in a gland, or any morbid structure, it is proper to let the abscess either open naturally, or at all events be completely formed before interfering with it. In other cases, so soon as the fluctua- tion can be distinctly perceived, and the abscess points, the opening should be effected. After the matter begins to form, and before it is evacuated, poultices and fomentations are applied, as they are believed to hasten the process of suppuration. Abscesses may be opened either by the knife or caustic. The former is infinitely less painful and more certain. The best in- strument for the purpose is either a straight or curved shai"p- pointed bistoury, which answers much better than the old- fashioned abscess lancet,—an instrument shaped like the common lancet, but of a larger size. The nan'ow blade of the bistouiy allows the point to enter the cavity with little pain, and then being pushed through the skin from within outwards, at the part to which it is desired the incision should extend, quickly com- pletes the aperture. If the parts to be divided are too thick for proceeding in this way, the knife may be carried through them dii'ectly to the requisite extent. It is always right to make a large opening; and, as a measure for determining its size, that of the part of the abscess which points may be taken, if it does not exceed an inch and a half or two inches. After the matter escapes, so far as it is induced to do so by the contraction of the parts containing it, a piece of lint should be placed between the lips of the wound to prevent them from uniting by the first intention; but care must be taken that it is not so thick or forcibly introduced as to confine the discharge, and consequently oppose the obliteration of the cavity. When the bleeding has ceased, a poultice should be applied, but not before, since aSUPPUEATION. 65 troublesome hemorrhage may otherwise ensue. In some situa- tions, great difficulty is occasionally experienced in arresting the flow from arterial branches divided by the incision, from their resisting the efforts of pressure, and not admitting the applica- tion of ligatures, owing to the softened state of the texture surrounding the orifices. In such circumstances the best method is to pass a needle through the integuments into the cavity, and tlien bringing it out so as to include the vessel in a ligature, which being tied, proves certainly effectual, and may be removed when it ceases to be required. The poultice may be continued for a few days to promote the escape of matter secreted by the surface of the abscess, and then simple ointment, or wet lint, supported with a proper bandage, should be employed until the cure is completed. When caustic is used, it should be applied as if for making an issue; and in case it does not extend its effect through the whole parietes of the cavity, a knife may be pushed into the eschar or slough caused by its operation. Patients who could not bear the idea of having their sound skin cut, have sometimes comparatively little objection to this. Some practitioners prefer caustic for opening abscesses, on the ground that, while making the aperture, it hastens the sup- purative process. But if means for this purpose are required, there are others which can be used with more effect, and leave •the opening to be made by the more eligible method of the knife. When, owing to peculiarity of the part or patient, it is de- sirable to avoid making a breach in the surface, means sLould be used to promote removal of the matter by absorption. The best of these are blisters, followed by pressure. The cases in which they can be used with effect are chiefly those of slow suppura- tion in the glands, and under the periosteum. Abscesses are said to be Chronic or cold when the symptoms of inflammation which precede them are mild or not at all observable. In such cases, the collection generally forms slowly and FCG PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. insidiously, so as not to attract attention until it attains a large size. Owing to the want of action that attends its origin, there is little effusion of Ipnph, and consequently little resistance to the extension of the matter, whence the swelling is often of an irregular figure, and readily changes its place according to the tendency of gravity. Wlien the matter passes from one part to another, it constitutes what is called a congestive absaess. The contents of chronic abscesses are generally thin, and bear no small resemblance to whey, especially as they usually have flakes of curdy-looking matter floating in them. The superjacent skin is generally not altered in colour. These abscesses have little disposition to evacuate themselves spontaneously, as the matter readily extends itself, and thus does not occasion sufficient pressure to induce absorption of the ex- ternal parietes. It is hence the more necessary to make an artificial opening, but this cannot be done without some danger when the collection is large. The surface of the cavity, which not unfrequently is capacious enough to contain several pounds of fluid, sometimes inflames, and produces such violent constitu- tional disturbance as proves fatal in a few days. More frequently the bad consequence consists in a profuse and long-continued discharge from the morbid surface, by which the patient's strength is gradually exhausted, and Hectic Fever, as it is called, is excited. In this condition, the patient becomes excessively weak and emaciated; the countenance is extremely pale, with the exception of a red patch on the cheeks, whicb contrasts re- markably with the whiteness of the other parts of the face and especially of the eyes; the pulse is quick and weak; he com- plains, particularly in the evening, of burning heat in the palms of his hands and soles of his feet; his skin is dry and hot; and he suffers from noctiirnal sweats, often together with diarrhoea. This kind of disturbance is the usual result of continued irritation operating on a weak subject, and one of its most common causes is the discharge that follows the opening of a chronic abscess. It used to be supposed that the matter occa- sioned the fever by being absorbed into the mass of circulat-SUPPUEATION. 67 ing fluids, but this opinion is now abandoned, and the effects on the system are attributed to the irritation which attends its secretion. Though the expression Hectic Fever is sanctioned by long use and universal acceptation, there appears to be good reason for laying it aside, since it leads directly and unavoidably to erroneous ideas of the condition which it is employed to denote. Fever implies disturbance of all the corporeal functions ; but in the hectic state, those of the stomach, brain, and many other parts, remain unaffected. Instead of Hectic Fever, therefore, it would perhaps be be'tter to use the expression of Hectic Irrita- tion. The effect of this irritation is to weaken the system more and more; at length fever is really induced—the patient shivers —his tongue becomes foul—^he loses his appetite—and speedily sinks under the disease. A method of treating chronic abscesses was introduced by Mr. Abernethy, which has generally been regarded as a great improvement, though often of doubtful expediency. It consisted in drawing off, at first, only part of the contents by means of a trocar, allowing the wound to heal by the first intention, and then repeating the puncture, with the interval of two or three weeks, until the collection was so reduced in size, that the cavity could be safely laid open and healed from the bottom as an ordinary abscess. If the abscess is large, the patient should be confined to bed, and kept quiet for some days previously and subsequently ■to the operation; for if these precautions be disregarded, even though the wound should heal by the first intention, there will be a risk of inflammation. Care should be taken to prevent the entrance of air, not because it possesses any power of direct irritation, but because it promotes putrefaction of the remaining matter, and in that way gives rise to the most violent disturbance. If there is reason to suppose that the abscess is connected with any incurable disease in the bones or elsewhere, it ought not to be opened, unless proving the cause of pain or some other serious inconvenience, since doing so could only accelerate the patient's fate, and bring the surgical art into discredit. Such abscesses often exist for years without suffering apparently any change, orrniNCIPLES OF SURGERY. G8 giving the patient mucli inconvenience, but upon being opened speedily prove fatal. Sinus and Fistula. When an abscess is seated in parts of whicli tlie action is defective owing to local or general causes, the cavity that re- mains after its evacuation does not contract completely, but continues to secrete a discharge, which is generally thin and copious, and then constitutes what is called a Sinus. The surface, in course of time, becomes condensed and smooth, so as to re- semble a mucous membrane rather than the granulated covering of an ulcer—and if the discharge be copious, or any source of irritation exist, lymph is effused around the cavity so as to thicken its walls, and render them almost of cartilaginous hard- ness. In such a confirmed state, the sinus is named a Fistula; but this term is usually confined in its application to sinuses connected with the natural excretory canals, as the urethra or rectum, the contents of which, by passing through the preter- natural channel, prevent it from closing, and cause thickening of its walls. This hardening, or callosity, was formerly thought to depend on a morbid disposition of the part, and to require extir- pation as an essential step to the patient's recovery. The opera- tions practised on this principle were extremely severe, and one of the great improvements derived from the more enlightened pathology of modern surgery is their entire disuse, in this country at least. It is now found to be sufBcient for remedying the induration to remove the cause of irritation that induced it, the methods of doing which will be explained hereafter, in con- nection with the different regions of the body which are apt to become the seat of fistula. In treating sinuses, the objects are to promote granulating action on their surface, and to press their sides together. They are not healed by filling up any more than the original cavity of the abscess, but contract untU they become obliterated, or close more directly by union of the opposite surfaces. Great care must be taken to avoid confining the discharge ofSUPPUIUTION. 69 the sinus, since, if prevented from escaping, it distends the sides of the cavity; and, for the same reason, it is always proper to afford the matter a dependent opening for its escape, either by enlarging the one already existing, or making a new one. The most effectual method of proceeding is to lay open the cavity throughout its whole extent by incision; and it is sometimes necessary to resort to this practice when milder measures have failed, or the result of experience in similar cases authorises the surgeon to dispense with their trial. The patient, by means of nourishing food, together with all the other adjuvants to the re- covery of general health, should, so far as possible, remedy weak- ness of action in the system, if there seems to be any fault in this respect. It is at all times of great consequence to prevent motion of the part affected. If the sinus is connected with any incurable disease, such as a carious bone that cannot be removed, or a malignant degeneration of the texture cancered, any severe measures would be obviously improper, and only those of the most soothing kind should be employed, with the view of afford- ing that palliation which is aU the case admits ofrniNCIPLES OF SUKGERY. 70 CHAPTEE VII. DISEASED NUTEITION. Tuinours. By Diseased Nutrition is understood an action of tlie capillary ^ vessels, which, instead of preserving the tissue concerned in a natural condition, increases its size or alters its texture. The morbid gi-owths thus resulting constitute the principal division of a most important class of surgical diseases, which are named Tumours. The term tumour implies enlargement of a part of the body beyond its natural dimensions, which may be owing to the effusion or accumulation of fluids, as in hydrocele ; the displace- ment of organs, as in hernia; or morbid growths, as in wens. Morbid growths include simple enlargements of the natural tissues, such as exostosis,—conversion of them into textures foreign to the healthy constitution of the body, such as cancer of the breast,—and the development of entirely new formations, such as fibrous tumours. Mr. Abemethy used the term tumour as synonymous with morbid growth, and restricted its appli- cation "to such swellings as arise from some new production, which made no part of the original composition of the body." As this would exclude many important enlargements of natural tissues which constitute tumours very deserving of attention, the more comprehensive definition that has just been stated seems to be j)referable. Morbid growths occur in almost every part of the body, but the glands and subcutaneous tissue are their most frequent seats. They are very variable in the rapidity and extent of their increase, but, generally speaking, grow quickly in proportion to their size ; and other things being equal, usually enlarge most vigorouslyDISEASED NUTRITION. 71 when their situation is dependent. Anything that irritates, or tends to inflame them, promotes tlieir increase ; and opposite cir- cumstances are attended with opposite effects; rest, low diet, cold applications, and leeches, lessen the activity of their enlargement. When inflammation attacks a morbid growth, it either termi- nates in resolution or mortification, or leads the way to some of the actions which have been described. But, whatever the action may be, it almost invariably proceeds in a peculiar sort of manner, so as to prevent a cure, or any satisfactory termination. Morbid growths deserve great attention, not only on account of the distressing consequences which thus ensue, but also in regard to the deformity and inconvenience which they occasion directly by their presence. They may be removed in three ways,—viz., by absorption, mortification, and excision. In order to determine on the choice of these means, and execute them properly, it is necessary to be acquainted more particularly with the different kinds of morbid growths. Mr. Abernethy's arrangement and nomenclature of tumours used to be generally adopted. He divided them into Sarcomatous and Encysted; the former being solid ; the latter composed of a cyst containing matters of variable consistence. Of late years, the microscopical investigation of morbid growths has been pursued with great assiduity, in expectation of its affording better characters for discrimination than those appreciable by simple inspection. But the hopes thus enter- tained have been very imperfectly realized, in consequence of the variations connected with diversity of texture ; and it must be confessed that little, if any, practical advantage has been obtained from tliis source—while the trust reposed in it, by withdrawing attention from the diagnostics presented by the sensible qualities, attendant circumstances, and histories of tumours, has in many cases led to the most serious mistakes. It is not impossible that the microscope may yet penetrate the obscurity which now renders its observations so uncertain; and then the distinctive characters hitherto in use may be safely laid aside. But in the meanwhile, I believe that a surgeon will best discharge the dutyPUINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 72 which he owes to his patients, by eudeavouring to make him- self inclepeudent of any such assistance, by careful study of the sensible characters. In doing so it will be necessary for him to recollect that the different and even remarkable seats of morbid growths are apt to approximate each other by a gradual transition, which frequently renders it difficult to draw a line of distinction between them. / Of all morbid growths, the simplest and apparently most akin to the natural structure, is that which has been named Simple or Vascular Sarcoma. It seems to be chiefly composed of accumu- lated cellidar tissue and blood-vessels. It sometimes exists as an independent tumour; but more frequently constitutes what are called simple enlargements of natural parts, as the testicle, or thyroid gland. It produces little inconvenience, except what pro- ceeds from its bulk ; and is recognised by negative characters,— that is, by not manifesting the peculiarities which distinguish the other kmds of morbid growth. Of all tumours, this is the one which yields most readily to means that promote absorption; and these, accordingly, are chiefly employed in its treatment. Of local applications, blisters and stimulating lotions, with ointments containing mercury, iodine, and the hydriodate of potass, are the most useful,—more or less pressure being at the same time applied. Mercury and iodine are also very serviceable when administered internally so as to affect the system, care being taken that their use is not pushed too far so as to injure the patient's health. If the tumour during the treatment becomes red or painful, a few leeches should be applied ; and the utmost care is to be taken throiighout, that the patient's secretions are duly performed. In this way, chronic enlargements of the glands, and simple sarcomatous growths exist- ing independently, may sometimes be dispersed. Should they prove obstiaate, and occasion much inconvenience or deformity, the best method of removing them is excision, if the circumstances of the case, as to the situation and connections of the tumour, do Simple Sarcoma.DISEASED NUTEITION. 73 not forbid it. Some attempts have been made to arrest the morbid nutritive action, or cause sloughing of the mass proceed- ing from it, by tying one or more of the nutrient arteries ; but experience on this subject has hitherto been very limited and unsatisfactory. ^ Under the head of Simple Sarcoma may be arranged the ex- crescences named Wart, and Polypus. The former is a growth from the skin, the latter from the mucous membranes.^ In both, the natural textures appear to be rather preternaturally extended, with more or less softening and relaxation of the structure, than subjected to any degeneration or morbid alteration of composition. Warts are met with most frequently on the hands, and on the thin skin which surrounds the outlets of the body—as the eye- Kds, lips, and prepuce. It must be here remarked, however, that most of the excrescences on the face, which are usually designated warts, really possess an entirely different nature, being altogether new formations which have nothing in common with the growth under consideration, except some resemblance of form, and require to be carefully distinguished, since the treatment which is proper for the one sort proves most injurious when applied to the other. Warts admit of removal by the action of stimulants, such as strong acetic acid, or the concentrated solution of sulphate of cop- per ; also by caustic, the ligature, and the knife or scissors. The first and last mentioned means are the best for the purpose—the former being emj)loyed when the growth possesses a soft con- sistence and broad base, the latter when it is firm and prominent. Polypus is a growth of softer consistence, but varies con- siderably in this respect according to the part from which it proceeds. The lining membranes of the nose and uterus are its most frequent seat; and next to them the rectum may be mentioned. It has usually a gTayish-yellow colour, and possesses little vascularity, with still less sensibility. The inconvenience caused by its presence is chiefly of a mechanical nature, but nevertheless often sufficiently distressing. The treatment is either palliative or radical—the former con- sisting in the use of astringent applications, and the latter in74 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. removal by evulsion, ligature, or excision. The expression poly- pus, like that of wart, is often loosely and inaccurately employed to denote growths of a totally different character, merely from their occupying the same situation. Adenoid Sarcoma. Under this title may be comprehended growths resembling secre^ing glands in their structure, but varying in density from that named Fibrous by anatomists, to the softer consistence of some glandular textures, as that of the pancreas. They usually possess a nodulated, or what mineralogists caU. a botiygidal sur- face, and a compact homogeReous consistence, with the exception of small cells, variable in size and number; they are of a yellowish or gray colour ; and are enclosed in . a capsulg, which separates them from the surrounding parts. They are met with in all parts of the body, but occur most frequently in t^e vicinity of the parotid and mammary glands, which they compress, and thus cause to be diminished by absorption, so as at last sometimes to occupy their place, and appear to superficial observers a morbid degeneration of the glands themselves. They are seldom attended with any inconvenience except what their size occasions, but occasionally become the seat of uneasy sensations ; they are not prone to any other. action than that of their own nutrition; and after attaining a certain magnitude, remain stationary, but in the course of time are apt to assume a more troublesome disposition. The only ef&cient treatment is removal by the knife, and this in general may be easily done. The incision should be made freely through the integuments, and fairly down to the substance of the tumour; and in detaching the cellular connections, the knife should be directed upon the surface of the growth, since it may be cut with impunity, while the neighbouring parts by doing so are protected from injury. A dipose Sarcoma. One of the most common solid tumours is that which has75 DISEASED NUTEITION. very properly been named the Adipose, or Fatty Growth. The appearance of its structure is precisely what the title indicates, and bears the closest resemblance to that of the ordinary sub- cutaneous fat. It is generally of a somewhat darker, though sometimes of a lighter yellow colour, and not so granular; it is suiToimded by a thin capsule, which keeps it distinct from the neighboiu'ing parts, imless they happen to be pressed together by the patient's clothes or otherwise, when adhesions occur between them; it is generally of a more irregular form than would be supposed from its appearance while covered by the integuments, and frequently sends out long processes in various directions. The skin covering such tumours is not discoloured, but usually shews some inequalities of surface, corresponding with the lobules of the growth. The adipose sarcoma occurs in every part of the body, and at all periods of life, but is most frequently met with under the integuments of the Jrunk in yonng females, and middle-aged people of both sexes. There are frequently more than one tumour in the same person. It tends to increase according to the princijDles already explained, and occasionally attains a monstrous .size, so as to weigh ten, fourteen, or even twenty-seven pounds, which was the weight of one removed from the parietes of the abdomen by Sir A. Cooper. It generally occasions no inconvenience except what is caused by its bulk, but sometimes becomes the seat of uneasy sensations, and weakens, in some way not yet explained, the voluntary action of the neigh- bouring muscles. It is not prone to any morbid action or de- generation, but has in some cases been found altered in this way. In treating adipose sarcoma, it is found that the means which promote absoi-ption have little or no effect, and that excision is the only mode of affording the patient relief, unless the tumour happens to have a very narrow neck, when the litagure may be employed, but not so advantageously as the knife, since the root or part seated under the skin necessarily remains, and is apt to prove the source of a future growth. The capsule which sur- rounds the growth hardly adheres to it, except in the circumstance above mentioned of having been subjected to pressure, so that76 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. the dissection is extremely easy and readily performed. The incision should be made freely down to the substance of the tumour, wliich is then to be drawn outwards and detached from the cellular connections by repeated applications of the knife directed upon its surface. The finger-like processes, often sent out on different sides, must be carefully disengaged in the same way from the sort of sheaths in which they lie, by alternately gently pulling and slightly scarifying them. Fihro-cariilaffinotis Sarcoma. The consistence of this tumom', as may be infen-ed from its title, is softei: than that of cartilage, to which it bears most resemblance. It frequently occurs in connection with the tissue, sometimes giwiug-Qlit in a distinct mass which is called an Enchondroma. and on other occasions e_xpanding theJborie into spicular processes, or an imperfect shell containing the morbid growth, which is then named osseous Osteo-sarcoma. Tumours of this Icind are also met with in other textures, as the muscular, but wherever seated admit of remedy only by removal, and this may in general be done with a good prosx^ect of jjeiTaanent recovery. Cystic Sarcoma. Tumours are occasionally met with, which, when divided, exhibit a cellidar structure, the compartments being extremely variable in their relative as well as absolute size, and in the nature of their contents. Sometimes they are perfectly fluid, at other times viscid or glairy, and their colour is of every kind, though most frequently yellow or wMte. Different cells of the same tumour often have dissimilar contents. Sometimes the tumour is entirely composed of cysts, at other times a variable J)roportion of solid substance is interposed between them, and this possesses the characters of fibrous sarcoma. This Cystic Sarcoma, as it is called, tends to increase, and does not appear to have any limits to the size which it may attain, as may be seen in the case of ovarian dropsy, which de- pends upon the great development of a cystic stractui-e in theDISEASED NUTEITION. 77 ovaiy. It is not prone to degeneration, and does not occasion almost any imeasiness, except lay its bull?, causing deformity, impeding the movements of the patient, or pressing injuriously on important organs. It occurs most frequently in glandular structures, especially the ovaries, testicles, and mamma, but is also occasionally observed under the integuments of the trunk, more particularly the upper, part of it, and rarely on the limbs. It is recognised by its imperfect fluctuation and bluish colour. The only treatment that this growth admits of with advantage is excision, which is effected with very different degrees of facility, according to circumstances. If the tumour be seated in a texture of limited extent, such as the mamma, it may be very readily removed. But if it commences simply in the cellular texture, it is apt to spread so widely, and contract such adhesions, as to render an effectual operation very difficult, or even impracticable. In such situations, it is therefore the duty of the surgeon to press Tipon the patient the propriety of early extirpation. Carcinomatous Sarcoma. The morbid structure which is designated Carcinoma, is dis- tinguished by its great fiiPinp.sR, and almost cartilaginDus haxdness; whence it used to be, and still is, occasionally called Sfiioims. The dense textaire which characterises carcinoma does not con- stitute a uniform homogeneous mass, buLbas numerous interstices which are filled with a yello,w orjhrownish-gray friable substance, and it is generally extended in the form of diverging bands which spread into the neighbourhood. When the disease occurs in an organ of limited extent, as a lymphatic gland, it does not tend to diffuse itseK beyond the confines of the part concerned, the struc- ture of which it affects more uniformly than when seated in a tissue less distinctly bounded. As the disease proceeds, however, it at last breaks through this obstacle, and then spreads as has been already described. The carcinomatous action extends itself in a different way also, namely,.along the absorbent vessels and glands of the part originally affected. It would seem, in general, to take tliis course more readily than to pass directly froiil -bne78 PIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. tissue to another. As to the mode in which the morbid action is transmitted along the absorbents, there exists a difference of opinion—some thinking that matter must be conveyed through the vessels; others that the mere irritation of the disease, pro- pagated along the coats of the lymphatics, is sufficient to account for the sympathetic affection of the parts in question. The fact is certain that glands, in the course of the absorbents leading from a carcinomatous tumour, are often thoroughly tainted, though the original mass remains solid, and contains no fluid matter in its interstices. Carcinoma occurs most frequently in glandular or secreting structures, and the mamma, lips, skin, tongue, stomach, and uterus, may be mentioned as its most common seats. It seldom commences in people below middle age, aud from forty to fifty may be mentioned as its favourite time of attack; but it is occa- sionally observed in persons much younger than this, even in those who are not more than twenty or thirty. I am not aware of its having beea^ver met with bgfbre puberty. The predis- position of parts to carcinomatous action seems to be increased by their suffering chronic enlargement and induration; and the disease is generally called into existence by some irritation either direct or indirect. Of the former, blows and bruises may be mentioned as those most frequently concerned, and of the latter, suppression of habitual secretions. The cessation of the men- strual discharge, though a natural event, almost always occasions more or less disturbance of the system; and this occurring at a period of life when, other things being equal, the tendency to carcinomatous action seems to be strongest, has been thought to exert great influence in exciting the disease. The disposition to the morbid action is sometimes so strong, that it begins without any local cause, and is then apt to.occiu- in more parts of the body than one. The patient usually betrays the imJiealthy ten- dency by a peculiar greenish-yellow complexion, and anxious expression of countenance. The characteristic symptoms of carcinoma are hardness and pain. The hardness exceeds that of any natural texture, except79 DISEASED NUTKITION. bone and cartilage. The pain is usually of a lancinating or darting kind, not constant, but attacking the patient by fits. Sometimes it is described as hot or burning, and is then usually more fixed. Carcinoma tends to inflame and ulcerate. If the skin is affected, this takes place on the surface, in which a breach opens, and gradually extends. If the disease be more deeply seated, an abscess is formed within it, which discharges its contents, and leaves a cavity ready to take on the same sort of action as the ulcer which is established in the other way. In both cases the ulcer makes no advance towards reparation, but proves truly specific and incorrigible, and is named a Cancer. The process is occasionally reversed, the morbid formation taking place round a sore, which in the first instance does not present any malig- nant characters. The base and edges of cancer are of course extremely hard, siace the excavation is formed in a carciao- matous mass. The ulcer is very irregular in the shape of its margin and surface; sometimes it is deep, and as if scooped out of the part; at other times, cauliflower-looking excrescences rise from it, and hang over the edge. The discharge is generally profuse, bloody, and fetid. The pain is usually incessant, and of various kinds, but sometimes gives very httle trouble. The patient loses appetite and sleep; complains of wandering pains and weakness of the limbs; becomes gradually exhausted; and .at last dies, in general rather suddenly, before the period which might have been expected from the progress of the disease. The rapidity of its course varies greatly, a few months being some- times sufficient for its reaching a fatal termination; while in other cases it exists for years with little change, or even remains stationary altogether. The treatment of carcinoma in its different stages has engaged more attention than perhaps that of any other surgical disease; and it has been repeatedly believed that means of correcting the morbid action were discovered. More careful observation has uniformly proved these expectations to be fallacious: and it must be admitted, that, so far as we know at present, there is noPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY % 80 cure for carcinoma except extirpation. Mucli may perhaps be done in tlie way of prevention, by protecting those parts of the body most subject to the disease from the influence of iiTitation, at that period of life when the disposition to it exists most strongly. Tranquillity of body and mind, regularity in the secre- tions, and moderate diet, conduce to the same effect. The pain of cancer may be soothed by opiates, used both externally and internally. Hemlock poultices, lotions and ointments of acetate of lead, carbonate of iron, various preparations of arsenic, pressure, and an endless catalogue of applications, might be mentioned, as having been more or less confided in for correcting the diseased action, and instituting a healing one. They sometimes afford temporary relief, but never effect any permanent alteration to the better. The only proceeding that deserves at all to be considered a remedy for carcinoma, is removal of the morbid structure. This may be done sometimes by caxistics, such as sulphuric acid and the chloride of zinc, applied in substance or formed into a paste ; but these means are very apt to destroy the disease only partially, and consequently do harm instead of good, by exciting greater activity in the portion that remains. The knife or scissors effect the extirpation most easUy and securely. It would be subjecting the patient to useless pain, and bringing surgery into discredit, to attempt extirpation in cases where the extent or connections of the disease prevented its complete removal It is also incumbent on the surgeon to search very ^carefully for glands in the course of the absorbents that may have become affected, since it appears that the result of operations for carci- noma, when the glands are affected, is almost invariably unsatis- factory, however perfectly they may seem to be taken away. The reason of this probably is, that the glands do not participate in the disease, unless the system be strongly disposed to it, and consequently their removal, however freely and effectually executed, cannot prevent the patient's relapse. In performing the operation, it is not sufficient to take away the mere indurated mass, as the surrounding parts are always more or less vitiatedDISEASED NUTRITIOlf. 81 in tlieir disposition. If tlie disease is seated in a distinct organ, the wliole of it ought always to be removed, however small the part which is actually affected may be; and when the tissue concerned is not in this way circumscribed, the knife should be carried as wide as possible from the tumour. Medullary Sarcoma. The title of Cerebriform is perhaps more correct than that of Medullary, to designate the species of sarcoma wliich is now to be considered ; but as the general acceptation of the latter term has fully sanctioned its use, there would be no advantage in attempting a change. The medullary growth bears a close resemblance to the sub- stance of brain, not only in appearance, but also in chemical composition. When divided, it seems as if composed of irregular masses, enclosed, and separated from each other more or less completely by thin membranous septa, which become more obvious after the soft pulpy mass is removed by maceration, or the action of allialies. The consistence of the tumour, though in general pretty nearly that of the brain, is sometimes much denser; at other times more approacliing fluidity than the natu- ral state of this tissue. Its colour, also, is subject to much variety, from almost purejwhite to the darkest red,—the differ- ence in this respect seeming to depend on the quantity of blood which circulates through the growth, or is effused into its inter- stices. The proportion of blood is sometimes so great, that the tumour, when divided, resembles a coagulum; but more fre- quently it exhibits merely spots or blotches, irregularly inter- spersed through the substance of the mass. Occasionally, but not frequently, this morbid growth appears in the fonn of a cyst, the parietes of which, though of little thickness, are composed of the cerebriform structure, while the cavity is occupied by clear serous fluid, usually of a greenish colour. It is then apt to be mistaken for distention of a bursa or an abscess ; especially as the most common seat of the disease in this form is the upper and inner part of the thigh. GPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 82 Medullary sarcoma may occur in any tissue of the body, but originates most frequently in tlie Itiones, testicle, mamma, and .gye ; next to wliicli the subcutaneous cellular texture, brain, and lymphatic glands, are the most common seats of its commence- ment. Lilce carcinoma, it extends both into the neighbouring parts and along the absorbents. It occurs at all ages, but is most frequently met with in infants, and adults between twenty and forty. It is recognised by its soft semi-fluctuating con- sistence, which is sometimes very apt to make the swelling be regarded as depending on the presence of a fluid. The suj)erficial Ygins become yery jnrich Qnlargejl; but as they do so, though hardly to the same extent, in nearly aU chronic enlargements, this diagnostic mark must be considered merely as a con-obora- tion of the more positive evidence which is afforded by the con- sistence, situation, and history of the tumour. The pain that attends it is extremely^uncertain, beiag in some cases very severe, in others hardly perceptible. This morbid growth, after attaining a certain size, tends to open and protrude the soft substance composing it. It does so by sloughing, the formation and evacuation of an abscess, or simplyjilceratiari.. In whichever of these ways the bm-sting, as it is called, takes place, the integuments covering the tumour first become red and adherent, then the breach is established, the substance of the tumour presents itself to view, and fungous excresceiiQes usually shoot out from the cavity. The discharge that ensues is always profuse, and generally very thin, excessively fetid, and occasionally bloody. In some cases, pure blood is effused from time to time in considerable quantity ; and hence, Mr. Hay of Leeds, who first gave a general description of the disease, named it Fungus Hcematodes. TMs term cannot be applied with propriety, and leads to much confusion, because the fungous protrusions of medullary sarcoma do not always, or even generally, bleed, while a bleeding fungus may appear without being preceded by the medullary formation. There is nothing peculiar in the texture of such bleeding excrescences ; and if the term fitngv^ hcematodes be retained, it should have its use con-83 DISEASED NUTRITION. filled to express simply the fact of there being a fungous pro- tnision from wliicli blood issues. Medullary sarcoma, in its advanced stage, is attended with a greenish-yellow complexion, and general emaciation. If allowed to proceed, it sooner or later destroys the patient by gradual ex- haustion. The rapidity of its course, like that of carcinoma, is extremely variable, and cannot be foretold according to any data with which we are as yet acquainted. The treatment of tliis dis- ease is, in general, very unsatisfactory. All local applications and internal remedies are admitted to be totally useless, and the only mode of affording relief is excision; while, owing to the tendency of the morbid action to diffuse itseK into the neighbour- ing parts, whatever be their nature or texture, as well as the taint, or unhealthy disposition of the system, the operations for this purpose are very often followed by relapse. Unless, how- ever, the case does not permit complete ablation of the tumour, or there should be indications of the disease existing in other regions of the body, or the pulse is quickened by the local krita- tion—in wliich case, so far as I have observed, recovery hardly ever follows an operation—it is the duty of the surgeon to give the patient the benefit of the chance that is thus afforded ; and, of course, the sooner that this is done the better, after the nature of the malady has been ascertained. The prospect of permanent relief seems most favourable when the disease is seated in the testicle or bones, and most hopeless when the eyeball is affected. Nearly connected with this kind of growth is that which has been named Melanosis. The title was applied by Laennec to tumours possessing the same soft brain-like structure, but differ- ing in regard to their colour, which, instead of being white, was either dark brown, or black. In other respects, the diseases resemble each other so closely as hardly to require separate designations, affecting the same parts, following the same course, and requiring the same treatment. It may be remarked, how- ever, that the morbid tendency, as shewn by extension, repro- duction, or simultaneous formation at distant parts of the body, is not, in general, nearlyso active in the melanotic as in84 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. the ordinary form of cerebriform sarcoma, and that the prospect of benefit from removal by operation is consequently not so unfavourable. Scrofulous Sarcoma. The naorbid formation usually called Scrofula, presents different appearances, according to the tissue affected. In general, it constitutes rounded masses or tubercles, as they are named, ■which consists of a gra^h-ye]J.ow, gritty, semi-organised- looking substance. It sometimes is not condensed and circum- scribed in this way, but exists in a diffused state, so as to produce more or less change in the structm-e concerned. Lj the^ bones, it is confined to^]je,^nceUated texture, the interstices of ■which it fills. In the synovial membrane it produces a remarkable tliickening, softening, and conversion into a sort of gelatinous consistence. In the lungs, lymphatic and mesenteric glands, subcutaneous tissue, brain, and dura mater, it occurs in the tubercular form. It is not attended ■with pain, and hardly pro- duces any inconvenience, except by its bulk causing deformity, or pressing injuriously on important organs. The morbid formations generally remain stationary for a longer or shorter period, and then are either absorbed, or, as more frequently happens, suppurate, so as to constitute abscesses, con^ taining thin sero-purulenfc. ^S^d, ■with flakes of scrofulous matter floating in it. When the matter is discharged, the restorative process advances slowly and imperfectly; indolent, sinuses gr wea]^ulcers almost always result; and owing to the situation of the disease, or the nature of the tissues affected, as may too frequently be seen in regard to the lungs and bones, a cure is, perhaps, never accomplished. The disposition to scrofulous action exists most strongly in childhood, fEppj .tv?p Jtp Jfpjirteen years of age ; but traces of its effects are sometimes observed much earlier, and it would be difficult to prove that its operation does not occasionally continue in the most advanced age. The morbid tendency may be inheri- ted as a peculiarity of constitution, and is usually associated with85 DISEASED NUTRITION. liglit hair, blue eyes, a fine skin, and florid complexion ; whence scrofiilous children often appear very healthy and thri\dng nntil they begin to suffer from the effects of their peculiar disposition. The earliest external indications of its presence are, in general, swelling of the upper lip and columna nasi, with tumefaction of the edges of the eyelids. Many exceptions occur in which all these signs are wanting ; and the patient, though of dark com- plexion, and exhibiting in other respects characters quite the re- verse of those just mentioned, betrays the strongest tendency to the disease. The scrofulous diathesis or constitution is not always equally well marked in the parents and their offspring; and its effects are much modified by circumstances. Whatever has a weaken- ing influence on the individual seems to increase the morbid tendency. Youth or sickliness of the parents—bad nursing— imwholesome or deficient food—and especially cold with mois- ture, may be particularly'mentioned as causing or contributing to this effect; and as, indeed, sufficient to induce scrofulous action without the presence of any hereditary taint. Persons who possess a scrofulous constitution are generally more liable to other diseases, and suffer from them more severely, than those whose systems are more healthy in their disposition. It is usual to name all these affections scrofulous when they occur in such circumstances, and hence gi-eat confusion continually arises. In order to avoid this, it will be better to restrict the use and signification of the term to those diseases which consist in, or proceed directly from, the morbid depositions, which have been described as the result of scrofuloiis action. In the treatment of scrofula, the first object should be to ob- viate the circumstances which increase the hereditary disposition, or produce its effect. The child should be carefully nursed, wannly clothed, and supplied with a moderate allowance of wholesome nourishing food. Cod-liver oil has been found the most powerful means of invigoration that can be employed for this purpose, in consequence, no doubt, of its nutritive rather than of any real or alleged medicinal qualities. Indeed, the internal use of iodine.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 86 to whicli the agency of tlais oil has been ascribed, so far from being beneficial, appears very nnich opposed to the object in view. If necessaiy, mild means should be used to correct derangement of the intestinal secretions ; but nothing is more injurious than to keep up incessant irritation of the canal by frequently administering purgative medicines, the necessity for which may almost always be advantageously superseded by proper regulation of the diet and exercise. Should the indications which have been mentioned, or the parentage of the patient, lead to the persuasion that the disposition to the disease is very strong, the place of residence, if cold and moist, ought, if possible, to be changed for one that is dry and warm. When the scrofulous depositions are actually formed, the greatest care must be used to guard against the operation of all direct and indirect irritations, which might tend to excite their inflammation or suppui'ation. The means proper for this purpose depend on the part of the body affected, and will be explained hereafter ; but on all occasions it is right to attend to the climate, the regimen, and the secretions of the patient. Local aj^plications seem to have little power in causing absorption of scrofulous tumours ; and it should be carefully recollected, that the exciting influence through which they prove beneficial, if not duly regu- lated, may occasion inflammation and suppuration. When the abscess is seated in a part of the body exposed to view, as the neck, it becomes important to determine what mode of treatment will render the resulting cicatrix least observable. Sir A. Cooper strongly recommended a^small puncture to be made with a lancet so soon as any matter is formed, and that then the remain- ing scrofulous substance should be squeezed out. The result of many trials leads me to conclude that it is seldQ|i if ^|^' pos- sible in this way to effect evacuation complete^ ^(i^Pwhat seems to be the safest practice, is to let the matter be very fiiUy formed before opening the abscess, blister repeatedly, and then make a free incision. Various drugs are used empirically under the specious pretext of producing a gi-adual imj)rovement on the patient s constitution. The muriate of lime is one of these; andDISEASED NUTRITION. 87 there are people weak enough to believe the assertion, that it sometimes requires several years to effect any salutary change. Such practice is merely a cloak for quackery, and as such, is not less useless to the patient than disgraceful to the profession. It was formerly believed that a miraculous power of curing scrofu- lous diseases, by simply touching the patient, belonged to the kings of England from Edward the Confessor downwards, whence the common name of the disease still in use, viz., the King's Evil. The ceremony was performed at the commencement of summer, diuing -which season there is a strong tendency to spontaneous recovery; and this may account for the belief in a superstition so absurd. Encysted Ttimours. Encysted Tumours, or Wens, as they are called when of large size, consist of two parts—1. A bag or cyst of variable thickness, whence they have their title ; 2. A quantity of fluid, semifluid, or solid matter forming its contents. They are distingTUshed, in reference to the nature of their contents, into meliceritous, athe- romatous, and steatomatous, accordingly as they possess the con- sistence of honey, putty, or lard ; steatomes often contain, mixed up with the lardy-looking substance, a quantity of hairs, which seem to grow from the inner surface of the sac. Encysted tumours are of all sizes, but generally between those of a pea ahd walnut. They are seated immediately under the skin or mucous membrane, and chiefly abound on the head. Tliey are also met with about the organs of generation, but not nearly so frequently, and still more rarely over the limbs. It has been supposed that they are mere overgrowths of the natural sebaceous follicles or crypts, which lie in the skin ; and Dr. Sharpey has made known to me a curious observation, which would go to suppoi-t this opinion, viz., that the substance, wliich may be squeezed out of tlie follicles in question, contains nmne- rous small hairs, wliicli can be readily seen through a microscope of moderate power. In some cases, the cyst is obviously of this origin, having an aperture in the skin of a size proportioned toPEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 88 its own ; but these cases must be regarded as exceptions, and the completely subcutaneous position, with the usually entire, imperforated cysts of these tumours, afford good reason to regard them as altogether new formations. Encysted tumours are sometimes, but very rarely, absorbed ; and local irritation, as that of a blow, especially when it ruptures the bag, occasionally excites the action which effects their re- moval in this way. More frequently they remain stationary I after attaining a certain size, or gi'adiially enlarge, adliere to the ; skin, inflame, suppurate, and open. Wlien the timiour inflames, the suiTOimding cellular substance becomes engaged, and diffused swelling, occasionally of large extent, ensues, attended with severe pain and constitutional distui-bance. In such circiun- stances, a free crucial incision should be made through the affected part, and then a poultice be applied until the sore granulates. The best remedy for encysted tumours in their ordinary con- dition is excision. Wlien the tumour is seated under the scalp, its cyst generally adheres so very loosely, that the operation may be performed almost instantaneously, and with extreme facility, by running a knife through the long direction of the tumour, so as to divide the bag and superjacent integuments, and then pulling it away with forceps, or turning it out with the handle of the knife. If the tumour is large, and has been subjected to pressure, the sldn usually adheres to it at the most projecting part ; and when this is found to be the case, an elliptical portion must be removed so as to include the conjoined integument and cyst. In other parts of the body, the bag usually adheres by its whole surface to the surrounding tissue, and must then be either regiilarly dissected out, or if small, punctvired, emptied, and touched with caustic. General Observations on Tumours. Though a very large proportion of the tumours met with in practice may be readily referred to one or other of the kinds that have now been described, it must not be suj)posed that the cha-DISEASED NUTRITION. 89 ractcrs and disposition are always distinctly marked. Various combinations and gradations of structure, as well as properties, frequently present themselves, so as to render the diagnosis diffi- cult and imcertain. In general, however, it is stOl possible to determine the predominant features, and form a correct opinion as to the nature of the disease. But tumours also degenerate or change then- condition, in respect both to substance and action. Thus fibrous growths, after remaining for many years firm, cir- cumscribed, movable, and devoid of pain, may become partially or completely softened, confused with the surroimdiag textures, fixed in position, and the seat of fungous excrescences. Similar changes are observed in the cystic, vascular, and even adipose gro'wths. It would hence be often difficult to recognise the original nature of tumours presented in practice ; but this is of little consequence, since, whatever it may have been, the existing characters must regulate the opinion and practice. Thus, as already stated, fibrous growths may, for a long period of years, retain their simple unoffending nature, together with its charac- teristic features, and at length imdergo a change so as to assiune the condition of cerebriform tumours, when they are found to constitute no less imsatisfactory subjects of treatment than if they had originally possessed the same malignant dis- position. This degenerating process sometimes occurs in a reproductive form, as is observed in the case of a tumour not rmfrequently met with in both sexes at_the time of life when yoxith is passing intajmaturityj and also, though more seldom, at both earlier and later periods, and which I have been long accustomed to describe imder the title of Eecurrent Fibrous Tumour. It generally occurs on the trunk, and especially on the-doxaal region. The texture is usually white and somewhat fibrous looking, but sometinies can hardly be distinguished from the adipose forma- tion, from which, indeed, it has in some cases been found to differ only in having a slight admixture of cellular substance, rendering it more white and firm. There is at first no pain or other unpleasant symptoms, and the patient usually retains good90 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. general health. Tlie operation for removal, in these circum- stances, is readily undertaken, and executed without any diffi- culty or immediate bad consequence. But, sooner or later, after the wound is healed, another growth, or more frequently several of the same kind, appear in the neighbourhood; and if these be removed, they are speedily succeeded by new productions, of which the consistence is softer, the enlargement more rapid, and the distinction from neighbouring parts less complete. They also become painful and inclined to ulcerate and fungate, and finally prove fatal to the patient. In examining tumours with the view of ascertaining the nature of their structure, some practitioners are wont to explore their substance by introducing into it a flat needle, plane or gi'ooved, to pennit the contents, if fluid, to escape ; and there may occasionally be so much difficulty as to waiTant this practice. But, in general, aU such liberties should be carefully avoided, as dangerous, from their tendency to excite the morbid disposition of the part, and less worthy of confidence than the informatian obtained by careful manipulation.BLOOD-VESSELS. 91 CHAPTEE VIII. BLOOD-VESSELS. AKTERIES. The two great arterial trunks, the aorta and pulmonary artery, agree generally in structure and function, but differ remarkably in two respects. The branches of the former unite or anastomose freely with their neighbours, while those of the latter continue unconnected from their origin to their termination ; and the coats of the aorta are prone to morbid action, while those of the pulmonary artery are hardly ever known to suffer from it. It is the aorta alone which affords subject for surgical practice. The arterial tube is comj)osed of three coats—1. The ex- ternal or cellular; 2. The middle or fibrous; and, 3. The in- ternal or serous. The first of these consists merely of condensed cellular texture, and is therefore not recognised by some as a distinct tissue, being regarded rather as a modification of the cellular sheath which envelopes other organs of the body. But the larger arteries and veins, where lying contiguous, have usually a covering of this kind in addition to the one in question, which, from its compactness, strength, and constant existence, ought certainly to be considered an essential constituent part of the vessel The middle coat is composed of circular fibres, which, from their appearance and properties, have been referred to the elastic tissue; but also possess a contractile property. When examined in a large artery of the human body, or in the artery of a large animal, as the horse, they are distinctly extensible and resilient, so as to. resemble the ligamcnium michae of quadrapeds, and other similar stnictures. The elastic property of tliis coat must tend to preserve the vessel of a certain size, in oppositionPIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. 92 to the distending force of tlie blood, and the effect of any vital contractile power resident in the arterial tissue. That the arteries do possess such a power cannot be denied, since during life, and even for some time after death, at least after the extinction of sensation, they contract much beyond the Hmit determined by their elasticity, whenever they are freed from the distension of their contents. The internal coat is distinguished by its thinness and smoothness; it is probably lubricated by a secretion from its own surface,—and resembles the membranes which line the cavities of the body, whence it is named the Serous coat. All of these coats are vascular, and capable of perfoi-ming the actions, whether healthy or morbid, which are exercised by the nutritious system of other parts ; but the internal one is most subject to disease, and generally seems to be the source of altera- tions from the healthy structure, when they occur in the other constituent parts of the vessel. The actions which take place in it most frequently and readily, are effusion of lymph, and diseased nutrition. Effusion is induced as an immediate effect of various local irritations, such as pressure or wounds ; on which circimistance are founded the various methods of obstructing arteries that have been proposed in the treatment of disease. It is ascertained from experiments made on dogs and horses, that, if an artery be sub- jected for some hours to the pressure of a tight bandage encircling the limb, the canal of the vessel sometimes becomes impervious. This effect results more surely when the sides of the artery itself are directly compressed; and Dr. Jones discovered, that, when the internal and middle coats are divided, lymph is effused so copiously that obstruction frequently ensues, though the con- striction be not continued after the division is effected. Desault had ingeniously contrived to do this by tying the vessel tightly with a fiiTH roTind ligature, which, making no impression on the tough external coat, but dividing the soft yielding ones within, could be removed so as to leave the former entire, and the latter completely cut. Various attempts have been made to obliterate the arteries of the human subject by such means. Assalini em-BLOOD-VESSELS. 93 ployed little forceps, the blades of which could be approximated with regulated force by a screw passing through the handles. Mr. Travers conjoined pressure with division of the inner coats, by tying a ligature tightly with a slip-knot, and removing it from a few hours to two days afterwards. These ingenious and reason- able trials occasionally proved successful in practice, but the results have been very irregular. The obliteration of human arteries, though accomphshed by the same process, appears to be not so readily induced or completed as in the lower animals. And there are few situations in which the vessels are sufficiently accessible to admit of the necessary manipulations for affecting a temporary obstruction. All proceedings with this view are therefore now abandoned, and the method invariably followed consists in tying the vessel firmly with a small round silk liga- ture, wliich is left to be detached by the ulcerative absorption instituted throiigh the initation caused by its presence; the effusion of lymph that directly succeeds its application sealing up the cavity both above and below, so as to prevent hemorrhage during the process of separation. M. Amussat of Paris contrived another method of obstruct- ing large arteries, which generally succeeds in the lower animals, and has also been executed with success on the human subject. It consists in seizing the bare coats of the artery transversely with two pairs of forceps, and then, separating the two instru- ments from each other, so as to nipture the internal coats, and ■ throw them into folds. The effect of this procedure is interest- ing in respect to the pathology of the arteries, but will not probably be preferred in practice to that of the ligature. Lymph is also effused from the arterial coats as a consequence of inflammation ; and the spontaneous obstructions which tlius ensue deserve much attention. Though probably not very un- common, they escaped observation until lately, and are yet far from being generally known. The inflammation may be limited to a small part of the vessel, or affect nearly the whole of the arterial system. Tlie circumstances immediately concerned in its production are unknown ; but it is observed to be nearly con-PRINCIPLES OF SUUOERY. 94 fined to adults at or beyond middle age, having a bad habit of body.

On dissection, the vessels are foimd contracted, thickened in their coats, and firmly plugged with a dense, brown, fibriaous coagulum. The internal coat is sometimes ruptured or irregularly lacerated, so as to impede the channel of the vessel Obstruction of the vessels with coagulum used to be considered a regular consequence of mortification; but it is now ascertained to be by no means a common occurrence ; and when it does happen, ought probably rather to be regarded as a cause than an effect of the mortifica- tion. The plugging is now generally ascribed to fibrinous clots, or excrescences detached from some other part of the cu'culating system, and impacted at the seat of obstruction. The cases of this Embolism, as it has been called, seem to be by no means rare; and may account for the sudden stagnation of blood which is observed in cases where there was no preceding inflammation, or any injury of the arterial coats discoverable on examination after death or amputation. Opportunity is seldom afforded to treat the primary inflam- mation, and its diagnosis would not be easy. In case of its being discovered sufficiently early, the proper remedies would be local bleeding and fomentations, with calomel and Opium given internally. After the obstruction is completed, which may be learned by the coldness, numbness, want of pulsation, and liistory of the case, the utmost care must be taken to protect theBLOOD-VESSELS. 95 weakened part from depression on the one hand, and excitement on the other. It ought to be warmly clothed, hut guarded against external heat, and all other stimulants. Should mortifi- cation ensue, amputation ought to be performed above the obstruction, unless a line of demarcation appears lower. Diseased nutrition of the internal coat is a very common occurrence, especially in advanced age and unsound constitutions. The consequence of it is a deposition either of a soft pultaceous substance, which is named its atheromatous degeneration, or of calcareous scales, which constitute what is called ossification of the artery. In both cases, this morbid change affects principally the inner coat, a slender film on the surface of wliich remains as a lining to the vessel The two diseased alterations generally exist together, in variable proportion. They affect most fre- quently the aorta, and arteries of the inferior extremities. They seldom take place extensively before the age of sixty ; but are then so common, that they might almost be regarded as natural occurrences. Males are more subject to them than females. When a large artery becomes ossified it usually dilates, and thus transmits the blood more readily than might be expected from the thickening which it suffers; but the smaller ones become lessened in their capacity, so as to render the passage much less free than in the natural state ; and the patient com- plains of weakness, pain, and other uncomfortable sensations, with more or less emaciation in the part of the body where the Tessel is distributed. Wounds of Arteries. When an artery is wounded, the blood issues from it with great force in a stream, which is either continuous, or varied by successive pulsatory jets, according to the size of the vessel, and the aperture made in its coats. Unless the artery concerned be very large, or particularly cii'cumstanced, as will be explained hereafter,—in which cases hemorrhage does not cease until the individual has suffered a fatal depletion,—the flow of blood gradually diminishes, and after a time ceases, when the woundPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 96 heals* as it would have done iii other circuinstances. Various explanations have been offered to account for the spontaneous cessation of arterial hemorrhage. Petit (1730) referred it to the coagulation of blood, first without and then within the orifice of the vessel, so as to form a sort of cork or stopper to it. Morand (1736), in addition to coagulation, insisted upon there being also contraction of the mouth of the artery, both as to length and width, so that it assumed a conical form, which retained the clot. Pouteau (1760) rejected the preceding explanations, and referred the whole effect to injection of blood into the cellular substance. Dr. Kirkland (1763) maintained, to the conviction for a long while of most siu'geons in this coimtiy, that the process consisted in shrinldng and obliteration of the wounded vessel up to the first branch that came off above the injured part. In 1807, Dr. Jones proved, by a full and conclusive course of experiments, that none of these opinions were correct,—that the process in question was a complicated one,—and that it consisted of various distinct steps. He ascertained that, in the first place, the ex- tremity of the artery contracted somewhat, and withdrew itself by retraction; that then the blood was injected into the sur- romiding cellular substance, especially that of the sheath, and coagulated there, after which a coagidum formed first on the outside, then in the interior of the orifice of the vessel; and that, lastly, lymph being effused from the cut edges of the arterial coats, became gradually organised, so as to complete the obstruc- tion. In the course of time the artery contracted up to the first branch, and the clots were absorbed, when the cure might be considered complete. When the artery which has been wounded is prevented from retracting by its firm connection with the neighbouring parts, or by being only partially divided, or when the surrounding cellular substance is either very dense or very lax, this process is impeded, and the hemorrhage proves more obstinate than in ordinary cases. On the contrary, when an artery is not cut, but torn across, it seldom bleeds at aU, even though of large size, because the external or cellular coat being the last to give way during the stretching of the artery.BLOOD-VESSELS. 97 ' when at last ruptured, is elongated beyond the internal and i midcUe ones, and instead of resuming its relative situation with J regard to them, collapses into a conical form, so as effectually to i close the orifice. . This explanation I ventured originally to give S on the authority of experiments repeatedly performed, and as L affording a more satisfactory explanation of the fact than tho^ j f (violence, and therefore induce more speedy coagulation of tM^ ,-. /'previously offered to account for it, viz., that arteries retract ^1 '^^ore when torn,—that the edges of the orifice are killed by the /i?Dlood,—and that the internal coats are more extensively rup- /' /' tured than the external one, so as to form irregular folds or pro- /^jections into the cavity. Every opportunity of ascertaining the truth through actual examination, and they have not been few, has tended to confirm this opinion, by shewing that the internal and middle coats terminate abruptly with a smooth circular edge, as if cut by a ligature, and that the external one forms a conical bag containing coagulated blo(5d. In some constitutions there is a remarkable disposition to bleed, so that the slightest wounds become troublesome, or even dangerous. This hemi^orrhagic tendency is generally observed most distinctly in children,—is associated with both fair and dark complexions,—is frequently hereditary, and can be dis- covered only by experience of its effects. The means employed artificially for conducing to the cessa- tion of hemorrhage, may be referred to the ligature, pressure, ■. and styptics. The use of the ligature was introduced by Am- brose Pare in the latter end of the sixteenth century. He, and still more his successors, applied it injuriously by including a portion of the surrounding tissues to give it a secure hold. Parc^ employed large broad-bladed forceps, called crane-bill from their shape ; but the instrument generally preferred was a ciirved needle, which, being thrust through or around the vessel, to- gether with the parts adjoining, subjected to the ligature a mass not only quite supeifluous, but which likewise was apt to occa- sion great inconvenience by^ shrinking subseqxiently so as to render the ligature loose, liy delaying its separation, or by excit- H98 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. ing intlammatioii. Mr. Bromfield (1772) pointed out the -pro- priety of tying merely the coats of tire vessel, and introduced into general use for this purpose the Tenaculum, which had been previously recommended by Cheselden. It consisted of a sharp, curved, round needle fixed in a handle, and was employed to transfix and draw out the mouth of the artery, so as to let the ligature be tied about it. The common dissecting forceps, until lately, almost superseded the tenaculum, as rendering the insula- tion of the vessel more easy and complete ; but are now little used, in consequence of the more convenient instrument, known by the title of " catch forceps," having been introduced. The best material for the ligature is that sort of silk named " purse twist." It ought to be waxed previously to being used. . When the artery wounded is of large size, it must be tied both above and below the opening, as the anastomosing branches would otherwise maintain the hemorrhage from the inferior orifice. If it is necessary, in order to apply the ligatures, to ex- pose the artery more fully, this should, if possible, be done by dilating the original wound, since there is apt to be much difii- culty in finding the aperture when the surgeon cuts down on a different side of the vessel from that which is punctured. In tying an artery which has bled repeatedly, it is necessary to beware of mistaking for the orifice of the vessel a fibrinous cylindrical extension of it, the ligature of wliich could not pro- duce any permanent or beneficial effect. Pressure may, on many occasions, be employed to suppress hemon-hage more conveniently than the ligature, as when the artery is but small, or lies over some unyielding part which can afford good counter-pressure,—or is much branched and freely connected with neighbouring arteries of large size, so that several orifices would require to be tied,—when it is situated so deeply that the ligature could not be applied without a serious opera- tion,—or is in a state of ulceration. In wounds of the hands and feet, especially the palms of the former, and soles of the latter, no method is so convenient for stopping bleeding as pressure. Lint or sponge may be employed to effect the pressure ; but theBLOOD-VESSELS. 99 former is on many accounts preferable. Folded portions of it, successively increased in size, constituting what are called gra- 'I—- dimted__compEesaes, ought to be applied over the bleeding vessel, and secured by a proper bandage. Unless the first one is placed directly on the orifice of the artery, the subsequent pieces, how- ever firmly compressed, will have little effect, and therefore the wound should if necessary be dilated sufficiently to admit the lint. When the hem>|iorrhage takes place into a cavity, the parietes of which are firm and unyielding, it may sometimes be restrained by closing the outlets, so as to make the blood accu- mulate, and press upon the orifices whence it issues. Thus epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, may be arrested, and also hemorrhage from the uterus in the early months of pregnancy, by plugging the nostrils and vagina. Bleeding from a leech-bite may be arrested by transfixing the wound with a sewing needle and tying a thread tightly round it. In the same way was sub- dued a hemorrhage from the umbilicus of an infant, two weeks old,, which I saw with Dt. Begbie, and where the actual cautery had been used in vain, at the suggestion of the late Dr. Hamil- ton, who said that the very few cases of the same kind j)reviously seen by him had proved fatal. I passed two sewing needles crosswise as deep as possible through the conical cavity from which the blood proceeded, and then tied a thread round them. Styptics are agents which, independently of any compressing effect, possess a power of checking hemorrhage. Of these may be mentioned the sulphates of copper, zinc, iron, and alumina, and the nitrate of silver; strong spirits, oil of turpentine, and the actual cautery ; also soft spongy or powdery substances, such as dried lycoperdon, spiders' webs, and the agaric of the oak or amadou. This last constituted the famous styptic of Brossard, which possessed a very high reputation both in France and in this country towards the close of the last century. Before the proper principles for applying the ligature were ascertained and received, styptics were regarded as important means for controlling hemorrhage; but they are now very little used. M. Amussat endeavoured to introduce a fourth mode of suppressing hemor-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 100 rhage, which consists in twisting the mouths of the vessels. This torsion is effected differently, according to the size of the artery. When small, it is simply twisted ; when large, the internal coats arc first pushed back by means of one pair of forceps, while the extremity is tightly held by another. There can be no doubt as to the possibility of attaining the object on this principle; but the expediency of doing so seems much more questionable. In the removal of a tumom-, or any other considerable dissection, most of the arterial branches which throw out jets of blood, when divided, are speedily obstructed by the spontaneous process ; so that at the conclusion of the operation only the few of larger capacity requiring ligatures present themselves to view. Now, if every bleeding point had been subjected to torsion in the first instance, it might thus seem to have been productive of great benefit, while, if applied to the larger vessels, it would not afi'ord so complete security as the ligature. There is, accordingly, hardly any case in which the torsion proves useful except in wounds of the lips and cheeks, in which union by the first in- tention is very desii-able, and almost certainly effected if the raw edges are placed properly in contact; while the coronary arteries and other branches of the facial cannot be tied without leaving threads apt to disturb the adhesive process, and, from the projec- tion of their cut extremities beyond the surface of the wound, are very favourably situated for being twisted. The bleeding, after it has been stopped, sometimes returns, when it is called secondary hemorrhage. If it has ceased spon- taneously merely through the natural process, aided perhaps by syncope, which favours coagulation, the reaction of the system that ensues within an hour or two is apt to reinduce it.. If arrested by pressure, it may return either at tliis time, or not until two or three days afterwards, when the feverish excitement which is then occasioned by the irritation of the woimd tends to promote it; and if a ligature has been applied, the ulceration by which it is separated, if too rapid or extensive, may cause a bleeding from three days to as many weeks after the infliction of the injury. Wlien the hemorrhage, therefore, is considerable, theBLOOD-VESSELS. 101 local means of restraining it ouglit to be assisted by those which produce a corresponding effect on the system, such as rest, quiet, low diet, cooling purgatives, and whatever else may seem likely to moderate the force of the circulation. It has been proposed to obviate the immediately fatal effect of excessive hemorrhage, by transfusing the blood of another indi- vidual into the veins of the patient. The experience hitherto acquired on this subject is very unsatisfactory. Indeed, the profuse depletion requisite to sanction such a proceeding is gene- rally either accompanied with some incurable lesion of the system, or happens in circumstances which prevent the prepara- tions for it from being completed soon enough. The simplest and best mode of performing the operation is to fasten a bladder to the canula of a small trocar, or a small silver tube made for the purpose, with its extremity rounded and slightly curved, which being introduced into one of the veins of the arm, will transmit the blood received in the bladder, as it flows from the vein of the person who affords it, and descends into that of the patient by its own weight, or the influence of slight pressure exercised on the bag. The various ingenious and complicated apparatus, which have been contrived for effecting transfusion, are less manageable than this very simple one, which may always be constructed extemporaneously, and are objectionable on account of the extensive surface of dead matter to which they expose the blood, besides the risk of injecting air that attends their use. Anethrisvi. By the term Aneurism is understood a sac containing blood, fluid or coagulated, and communicating with the trunk of an artery. There has been much dispute as to the constitution of the aneurismal sac. Sennert, Severinus, Hildanus, Wiseman, etc., supposed that all the coats of the artery were destroyed; and that it was formed by the surrounding cellular substance alone. Fon-estus, Euysch, Diemerbrock, etc., thouglit that the arteiy was merely dilated ; while Morgagni, Lancisi, Guattani, etc.,PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. 102 maintained, that aneurisms might result either from simple dila- tation of the vessel, or from expansion of the cellular siibstance, and therefore divided them into true and false, accordingly as the artery was dilated or ruptured. Scarpa laboured to prove that the former do not exist, there being always rupture of the internal and middle coats. He has not succeeded in establishing his opinion to the full extent, but has certainly ascertained that it is extremely rare to find the artery entire, and forming the sac by its mere expansion. Aneurisms may be conveniently divided into true and false. The former being those in which one or more of the arterial coats remain entire ; the latter, those in which the vessel is completely ruptured, and the sac is formed by the surrounding cellular substance. Ti-ue aneurisms may be subdivided into those which consist of simple dilatation of all the coats, and those in which the external one alone remains entire. The former are very rare, and nearly confined to two parts of the arterial system—^viz., the aorta, and arteries of the brain. It was formerly supposed, from careless observation, that aneurism of the aorta generally de- pended on dilatation of all the coats, but Scarpa shewed that, in the great majority of cases, the inner ones at least were ruptured. Exceptions, however, are sometimes met with, in which there can be no doubt as to the integrity of the vessel. In the arteries of the brain, the external coat is very thin, and affords little resist- ance when the inner ones are destroyed by disease. Aneurism is therefore very rare in this situation, and when it does occur, depends on a general dilatation of the vessel. The true aneurisms, in which the internal coats are destroyed, and the external one alone remains, are much more common. Their shape is not so regular as that of the last-mentioned kind, since the external coat does not dilate uniformly roimd the cir- cumference of the vessel, but usually expands on that side where the internal layers are ruptured, so as to form a sort of bag or pouch, which often has only a very narrow communication ynth. the artery. The blood, which is received into this cavity, beingBLOOD-VESSELS, 103 removed as it were from the current of circulation, and exposed to a surface different from that of the healthy vessel, has a douhle inducement to coagulate, and accordingly does so, not all at once, but by degi'ees, thus forming a succession of concentric fibrinous laminse, which line the aneurismal sac, and sometimes fill its cavity completely. The arteries liable to this disease are almost all the great trunks of the system; and the parts of their course most fre- quently affected are those where they give off large branches, or are exposed by their situation to blows and sudden extremes of tension or relaxation. The aorta at its arch, origin of the coeliac, and its bifurcation, the carotid at its division, the axillary, the external iliac at the groin, and the popliteal, are the most com- mon seats of its occurrence. The first step in the production of this kind of aneurism is the formation of a breach in the iijner coats, through which the blood, being constantly urged by the force of the heart, passes and gradually distends the cellular coat into a bag. The tumouT thus caused must press upon the sur- rounding tissues, and, by its constantly increasing size, effect such a condensation of their textures as will greatly strengthen its parietes. The original breach or crevice can generally be traced either to a blow, sudden extension, and such sorts of injury, or to violent impulse of the heart, attendant upon some severe exertion. It would be difficult for these means to rupture the internal coats of._a,^ound artery, and if they did so, the speedy effusion of lymph would, we have reason to believe, in most cases at least, not only repair the injury, but obliterate the vessel. The artery, therefore, must in general be predisposed to suffer the process that has been described, by undergoing morbid degeneration of the internal coat, which renders it soft, easily torn, and unfit for performing the adhesive action. It has been already stated, that the inner and middle coats, though exten- sively altered in their texture, usually retain a thin membranous film, were it not for which, the frequency of aneurism would doubtless be much greater than it actually is; since in that case there would be no occasion for any particular force to cause thePRINCIPLES OF SUEGEUY. 104 breach, and it would occur as a certain consequence of the atlie- romatous alteration. Males are more subject to the disease than females, probably for the double reason that their predisiDositiuu to unsoundness of the arterial coats is stronger, and also that they are more exposed to the exciting influence of violent exer- tion, which may operate in determining the morbid degeneration of the artery concerned, as well as in directly causing the com- mencement of the aneurism. In false aneurisms none of the coats remain entire, and the sac is formed, in pari of its extent at least, merely by the sur- rounding cellular substance. They are generally of larger size and more irregxilar form than those which retain part of the arterial coats in their composition, whence also their contents are usually more completely coagulated. They are produced in two ways :—1. By the formation at once of a breach through aU the coats of the vessels together, which may be effected either by wounds or other kinds of violence, or by ulcerative absorption ; 2. By the sac of a true aneurism giving way, so as to aUow its contents to escape, and distend the cellular substance into another bag. They are therefore divided into primary and secondaiy; they ocfiur much more extensively over the arterial system than the true Idnd, since they not only result from these, but may arise from almost any artery that is wounded, and are frequently connected with vessels of inconsiderable size, such as the temporal / or radial, whUe those of spontaneous origin are limited to the larger trunlcs. It has been alleged that aneurisms may also be formed by the opening of an arteiy into the cavity of^an abscess, but without any well-authenticated facts to support such a doc- trine. Arteries lying near the surface of sinuses not unfrequently idcerate and bleed, whence it may seem lilvely that the same thing should happen wliile the cavity of the abscess remains entire. But as sound pathology rests upon weU-ascertained facts, and not upon mere probabilities or assumed analogies, the con- version of abscesses into aneurisms, so far as is known at present, must be entirely discredited. The signs of aneurism are, a tumoui', subsiding under pres-BLOOD-VESSELS. 105 sure, and returning when relieved from it with a whizzing noise and thrilling feel; pulsation, or rather a forcible distending throbbing ; feebleness of the pulse, coldness, numbness, and weakness of the parts beyond the disease, with cedematous swelling and pain, owing to pressure on the veins and nerves, j When the aneiuism is internal, these indications cannot always be recognised ; but there are then generally others presented by the derangement of the function, which is caused by the pre- sence of the tvimour impeding the action of neighbouring organs. These, however, are often not distinct, and at the same time are apt to be mistaken for the signs of other affections. The com- pressibihty and pulsation of the tumour are the grand distin- guishing characters of aneurism. They are most distinct when all the coats remain entire, because then the contents of the sac generally continiie fluid ; they are nsually well marked so long as the external coat does not give way; but in false aneurisms, especially those of old standing, where the cavity is of large size and irregular figure, they are often very obscure, or altogether unobservable, owing to the extent of coagulation which is apt to occur in such circumstances. The pulsatory movement commu- nicated to solid tumours by large arteries lying under them, is sometimes mistaken for the pulsation of an aneurism. This error wiU. be avoided by recollecting, that in aneurism there is a general and forcible expansion of the whole sac, which can be perceived as distinctly when the tumour is embraced laterally as when the hand is placed upon it, while the deceitful impulse communicated by an artery to a tumour seated over it is merely a faint heaving upwards, which can be felt only when the sur- geon presses in the direction of the vessel. The natural course of aneurism is to grow larger and larger, to change from the constitution of the true into that of the false kind, and then to terminate in one of the following modes:.— 1. The contents coagulate, and are absorbed with, or without, obliteration of the vessel; 2. The artery becomes obstructed from coagulation or the effusion of lymph, and ulcerative absorp- tion of the paiietes of the tumour allows its contents to escape ;106 PKINCIPLES OF SUHGERY. 3. The sac opens by ulceration or slougliing, without previous obstruction of the vessel. The consequence of the two first of these terminations is a natural cure ; that of the third, hemorrhage. The treatment of aneurism consists in the use of means which tend to promote one or other of the two salutary processes just mentioned. The earliest attempts of this kind were directed with a view to the second of them, and their rudeness was equalled by their severity. The sac having been opened by cutting or burn- ing, its contents were turned out, and then the hemorrhage was restrained by repeated aj)plications of the actual cautery, or some other powerful styptic. The introduction of the ligature for closing the mouths of arteries rendered this operation less pain- ful, formidable, and uncertain ; but the difficulty and danger attending it continued to be very great, and the instances of recovery were extremely rare. Surgeons, therefore, turned their attention to the other mode of natural cure, and endeavoured to promote coagulation, by lessening the force of the circulation, through the effect of bleeding, low diet, and rest. This plan of treatment is usually distinguished as that of Valsalva. In addi- tion to these means, Guattani recommended tight bandaging of the Kmb and tumour. Both methods were foiind to be extremely inefficient and uncertain, so that, though productive of less hann, they hardly afforded more benefit than the bloody proceeding which has been already described, and was in those days called the Operation for Aneurism. Amputation of the limb affected was therefore generally preferred, until it fortunately occuiTed to N John Hunter (1785), and much about the same time to Desault, that an effectual method of causing coagulation would be to obstruct the artery above the tumour, or between it and the heart, so that thus the natural cure by coagulation and absorp- tion might be safely and certainly induced. The first trials of this new practice were hardly so successful ' as was anticipated, owing to the vexatious, alarming, and not unfrequently fatal hemon-hage which attended the separation of the ligature applied to efleet obstruction of the artery. To107 BLOOD-VESSELS. obviate this cause of failure various contrivances were employed. The ligatures were sometimes drawn gently, lest they should cut the coats of the vessel, or a little roll of plaster was interposed with the same view between the knot and artery. Ligatures in the form of tapes were employed ; two or three of them were tied at some distance from each other, so as to compress a con- siderable extent of the vessel; and ligatures of reserve, as they were called, being introduced under the artery, beyond those which had been tied, were left loose, so that they might be draAvn tight if occasion should require, l^otwithstanding all these precautions, bleeding still occurred as often as before, and proved, if possible, even more unmanageable. In despair, there- fore, of obstructing arteries safely in this way, attempts were made to obhterate them without inducing the ulcerative absorp- tion which was requisite for the separation of the ligature. Simple compression of the vessel, division of its internal coat, and these two means conjoined, were tried for this purpose, but, as has been already stated, however promising they might appear from their results when practised on the lower animals, they were found to operate very uncertainly on the human arteries. Though these experiments thus did not lead directly to any prac- tical improvement, they occasioned such a series of extensive and accurate observ-ations, as had the happy effect of developing the true principles on which the bleeding caused by ligatures depends, and consequently shewed how it was to be avoided. The great source of danger, was found to proceed from the ulceration which detaches the ligature going beyond due bounds; and it was ascertained that the circumstances most conducive to this, were extensive separation of the artery from its neighbour- ing connections, the interposition of much foreign matter between it and them, or the irregular puckering of the coats by flat or twisted ligatures, also laceration and contusion of the neighbour- ing tissues, caused by exposing the vessel with the fingers or any blunt-pointed instrument, which prevented union by the first intention, and excited inflammation. Such being the case, it naturally followed that the most effectual method of preventingPRINCIPLES OF SUEGEllY. 108 hemorrhage was to use a ligature small, firm, aud round, to pass it round the artery with as little disturbance as possible to its connections, and to draw it tightly. It is to British surgeons, especially Messrs. Jones, Hodgson, Lawrence, and Travers, that the profession are chiefly indebted for establisliing these prin- ciples, wliich render the use of the ligature in the hands of a good operator equally easy and safe. To them, also, and more particularly to Cooper, Abernethy, and Listen, together with Drs. Post and Mott in America, is to be ascribed the honour of leading the way, by their bold and successful operations, resting on the sound foundation of cori-ect pathology, to the present treatment of aneurism, which contrasts remarkably, by its simplicity and safety, with the complexity aud danger of the older methods. The ligature should consist of waxed silk, and may in every situation be passed round the artery by means of a simple needle, after the sheath of the vessel has been opened merely to an extent sufficient for the purpose. One ligature only ought to be employed, unless the operator unfortunately denudes the artery too far, when he will diminish the risk of hemorrhage by intro- ducing two threads, and tying them as far apart from each other as the detachment of the vessel permits. Mr. Abernethy recom- mended this proceeding, together with division of the artery between the ligatures, as proper on all occasions admitting of it, in order to take off the effect of tension, and place the vessel as nearly as possible in the same situation with one tied after amputation, where the chance of bleeding is known to be greatly less. But the difference of the two cases in all probability does not depend on tension, while cutting the artery between the ligatures is attended with considerable danger of hemorrhage. After the principal artery of the Hmb is obstructed, the capil- lary anastomoses of the branches which arise above and below the impervious part, afford a new channel for the conveyance of the blood, and in general one so free that little apprehension need be entertained of bad consequences from imperfect circu- lation. Tlie dilatation of the small vessels which occurs before the operation, owing to tlie natural channel becoming more or109 BLOOD-VESSELS. less impeded by the disease, also contributes to prevent this. It has been thought by Dr. Pany of Bath, M. Maimoir of Geneva, etc., that new branches are occasionally formed, after a time, between, the obstructed extremities of the artery, leading directly from the one to the other; but there can be no doubt that the alleged new vessels are really the old ones of the sheath, which become enlarged in a greater proportion than the neighbouring capillaries, conformably with a well-ascertained law of anasto- motic circulation, viz., that those branches have the greatest tendency to enlarge which lie most nearly in the course of the obstructed vessel. In order to prepare the new passage for nourishing the limb, it has been proposed to delay operating in recent cases ; but the inconvenience attending a large sac, the contents of which are sometimes slowly and imperfectly absorbed, or excite irritation that induces suppuration, and the risk of the artery becoming diseased nearer the heart, more than counter- balance any slight advantage to be gained in this way. However free the new channel may be, it is always inade- quate, in the first instance, to afford the full supply of blood requisite for carrying on the various actions as usual. The limb becomes more or less cold and numb, and continues so for a longer or shorter time, seldom exceeding a few hours after the operation. It then rises in temperature even above that of the •corresponding sound one, and becomes painful; at the same time slight pulsation may return in the aneurism. To prevent this overaction from proving excessive, and inducing mortification, all sources of additional excitement, such as friction with stimulants, hot fomentations, and the like, ought to be carefully avoided. "WQien the stage of reaction subsides, which it does in a day or two, the limb still remains weak and liable to suffer from slight ii-ritation, so that even the pressure of its own weight occasionally causes sloughing. The support of a flannel bandage will there- fore be proper, and, with a similar view, though low diet and even bleeding may be proper previously to the operation, the patient ought not to have his strength reduced to a \ery low ebb by depletion, or very rigorous diet during the cure.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY 110 The bad consequences of this operation are gangrene, hemor- rhage, and suppuration of the sac. When the sloughing is of limi- ted extent, and dependent on pressure or feebleness of the patient's general strength, it ought to be combated by appropriate local and constitutional remedies; but when it is extensive, and the result of general inflammation of the limb, amputation should be performed withoixt delay, as high at least as the artery has been tied. There seems to be reason for suspecting that the mortiiication sometimes depends on the principal vein becoming obstructed, in conse- quence of the irritation suffered by its coats during the operation. The hemorrhage usually occurs about the time when the ligature separates, which is generally from the fourteenth to the twentieth day after the operation; but it may likewise occur either much sooner or considerably later. It appears for the most part very insidiously, not exceeding a few drops, but recurs from time to time in increasing quantity, until the patient, after being perhaps repeatedly saved by syncope, is finally exliausted. Pressure, together with the means which tend to lessen the force of the circulation, may be tried in the first instance ; but if the bleeding continues or returns, the surgeon must, without delay, either tie the artery neai^fjfche heart, or amputate the limb. Suppuration of the sac is a disagreeable, but not a very danger- ous occurrence, since it seldom takes place until the artery has been obliterated, so that there is no great fear of bleeding, and little to dread but a foul and extensive abscess. Whenever the matter . is actually formed, a free incision should be made to evacuate it, together with the clots ; after which, the cavity being in the first instance gently filled with lint, is to be treated with stimulating lotions and pressure. In a case of large diffused popliteal aneur- ism, for which I tied the femoral artery, suppuration occurred seven months after the operation, and was followed, after evacua- tion of the matter, by a very copious bleeding, which proved, upon examination of the amputated limb, to proceed from the breach in the artery leading into the aneurism, the vessel having been obliterated by the ligature only to the extent of three inches. The object of tying the artery being not to prevent the bloodIll BLOOD-VESSELS. from entering the aneurism, but merely to cause such stagnation of its current as may induce coagulation, it was proposed by M. Brasdor of Paris to obliterate the vessel lieyoncl the tumour, when circumstances prevented the operation from being performed be- tween it and the heart. Some unsuccessful attempts have been made on this principle ; but Mr. Wardrop has recorded several instances of its alleged more fortunate application. It is evident the operation cannot be performed with advantage, if a branch of any considerable size comes off between the aneurism and ligature, as this would allow the current of blood to continue; it could not be of any use in cases where, the sac being small and regularly dilated, the contents remain fluid ; and the only occasions where it promises any benefit, are those in which coagulation is already far advanced. But here the passage through the vessel beyond the tumour must be obstriicted nearly, if not altogether, as much as it can be by the ligature ; so that there, consec[uently, does not seem to be much probability of this operation being ever exten- sively introdiiced into practice. . Witliin the last quarter of a century, various attempts and proposals have been made to facilitate the treatment of aneurism, by inducing coagulation through other means than that of liga- ture. Of these may be mentioned galvanic acupuncture, injection of astringents, such as the perchloride of iron, and pressure on the artery concerned. The two first of these have so little practical evidence in their favour, that they need not be more particularly considered at present; but compression of the vessels deserves more attention. More than fifty years ago, some cases of poplit- eal aneurism were remedied on this principle in Paris, but at the expense of so much time and suffering as to deter from its general adoption. It now appears, however, chiefly through the exertions of Dr. Bellingham, and other surgeons of Dublin, that with a well-constructed and carefully regulated apparatus, the object may be frequently attained with a tolerable amount of pain and delay. On some occasions, a few hours have been found sufficient for the purpose ; but in general a period of from two to four weeks is requisite.112 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. The great argument in favour of tins method is its freedom from the danger of hemorrhage which attends tying the vessel. But it must be admitted, that while exempt from this objection, pressure is exposed to others, especially its risk of causing engorgement, inflammation, and mortification of the limb, together with the greater difficulty which may attend the ligature, from condensation of the textures, in the event of its subsequently proving necessary. It is only the femoral artery which can be subjected to the method in question ; and if this vessel be tied with proper care, there appears to be little or no danger from the operation, I have performed it thirty-three times without any bad consequences. On the whole, it would seem that the liga- ture is the quickest, easiest, most certain, and least painful means of remedy, while compression affords a useful substitute when circumstances prevent the operation from being performed with due attention to the circumstances requisite for its safety. The advantages of Himter's operation were so great and mani- fest in the situations for which it was proposed, that the old pro- cedure being thrown completely into the shade, the new one came to be regarded as preferable for the treatment of all aneurisms except those of recent traumatic origin. But there seems reason to think that a serious error was committed in this general adoption of one method to the exclusion of the other, since the grounds of preference are not the same in all situations, and are indeed in some of them completely reversed, as when the axillary artery is the seat of aneurism. There is here every facility for performing the old operation, and great difficulty, as well as danger, in carrying the Hunterian method into effect. But while this cannot be denied, it has been maintained that the difficulty of execution is greatly counterbalanced by the safety derived from tying the artery at a sound part, instead of doing so at the seat of rupture. Indeed, it has generally been beUeved that the whole extent of vessel comprehended by the aneurismal sac should be regarded as unfit for bearing a ligature, although an unprejudiced view of the subject could hardly have failed to shew that there was no sufficient foundation for this opinion.113 BLOOD-VESSELS. since the tumour is always small at its commencement, and the enlargement of its sac does not affect the artery concerned in regard to the soundness of its coats. It may be remarked fur- ther, that if the vessel is considered sound while beyond the confines of the aneurism, it should not be looked upon as diseased merely because the increasing size of the cavity has led to its envelopment. Another objection to the old operation, is the fear that opening a large sac would be attended with such profuse and protracted suppuration as might exhaust the patient's strength. But this apprehension can have no good ground, since the con- densed texture, which encloses the blood of an aneurism, has no tendency to maintaia a discharge after being relieved from the cause of distension. Lastly, it has been feared, that laying open a large tumour of the kind in question might give rise to fatal hemorrhage, but, as will be explained hereafter, any such danger may be avoided through the use of means which have been devised for the purpose. Treatment of Particular Aneurisms. Popliteal.—One of the most common situations of aneurism is the popliteal artery, which, being subject to sudden extremes of tension and relaxation more than any other part of the arterial system, must be exposed not only to the directly exciting causes • of the disease, but also to the predisposing effect of the same cir- cumstances leading to morbid alteration of its coats. The tumour occupies the popliteal cavity, which it gradually fills, but hardly extends beyond, so long as any part of the artery remains entire. A circumscribed pulsating swelling is felt in the ham, wliich weakens the limb, and usually occasions constantly increasing pain as well as cedema, by pressing on the nerve and vein that lie over it. In some cases so little inconvenience is felt, that the disease escapes observation until it attains a large size. When the external coat gives way, so as to let the blood escape into the cellular texture, and convert the true aneurism into a false one, the swelling suddenly extends in all directions. The limb then becomes entirely useless, excessively painful, and IPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 114 cedematous—the pressure of the tumour induces absoiptiou of the condyles of the femur—and if the disease is left to itself, the aneurism either opens and gives rise to a fatal hemorrhage, or undergoes a natural cure by coagulation and absorption of its contents. It was here that the old operation proved most difficult and appalling; and when we consider the deep situation of the arteiy, the diseased condition of its coats, and their close con- nection to the bone through means of the tendinous sheath of the triceps ; also the large and shapeless cavity, at the bottom of which the vessel was to be secured; the hardly repressible hemorrhage ; and the obstacle occasioned by the vein and nerve lying over the tumour, it does not seem surprising that its results should have been almost uniforndy fatal. Dr. Wilmer of Coven- try states, that at the time he wrote (1780), there was not an instance of its successful performance in this country. The modern operation could hardly have been more practicable for aneurism in this situation, if it had not been for the happy im- provement of John Hunter (1785), who, observing that no large branch rose from the artery for a long way above the tumour, proposed to tie-it on the fore part of the thigh, where it was nearer the surface, and at a greater distance from the disease ; where the operation would be easier, and the coats of the vessel might be expected to remain in a more healthy state. The artery may be tied either before or after it passes under the Sartorius muscle, but more conveniently at the former of these points, being there nearer the surface, and further from the disease. The patient being placed in a reclining posture, with his knee bent and the thigh placed on its outer side, the surgeon should feel with the fingers of his left hand for the triangular hollow which is formed by the meeting of the Sartorius and ad- ductor longus, then stretching the integuments not transversely, but in the long direction of the limb, he should make an incision from two and a half to three and a haK inches long, according to the thickness of the parts, having its lower extremity situated115 BLOOD-VESSELS. over the angle of union of the two muscles above mentioned, and running upwards at a nearly equal distance from their respective edges. Separating the lips of the wound, he should expose and divide the fascia, after which, making an assistant hold aside the edge of the sartorius, he will expose the sheath of the vessels, and, lifting it up with the dissecting forceps, open it sufficiently to let the coats of the artery be seen distinctly. It is here that the principal nicety of the operation lies, since too much exposure of the vessel, especially by tearing, or the use of blunt instruments, incurs the risk of secondary hemorrhage ; while if the arterial coat be not sufficiently denuded, there is no less danger of injuring the vein in the passage of the needle. The artery should be exposed by means of the dissecting forceps and knife, just as in a caxeful dissection on the dead body. The opening in the sheath need not exceed three-eighths of an inch in length; but the cellular or fatty substance immediately en- veloping the vessel in variable quantity must be raised in successive portions, and divided, until the surface of the artery appears perfectly white and distinct. The aneurism-needle, previously threaded, is then to be passed round the artery, which wiU be easily effected if it has been ade- quately exposed, and the edge of the opening in the sheath is held aside with forceps, to let the point of the instrument enter and escape. In doing this it is necessary to avoid the vein which lies below, and the nerve that runs on the outer or fibular side of the artery. On one occasion in the living body, and in another in the dead, I found a large vein, nearly half the size of the femoral, lying anterior to the artery. So soon as the ligature appears, it must be disengaged from the eye of the needle by the forceps or a hook, and pulled out of the wound while the instru- ment is withdrawn in the opposite direction. The operator having then satisfied himself that the artery and nothing more is included, should tie the ligature tightly in what sailors call the reef-knot, which is done by crossing the ends of the thread first one way and then the other. After the ligature is tied, one of the ends may be either cut away, or allowed to remain. ThePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. IIG needle, though introduced carefully and properly, sometimes occasions a pretty copious flow of blood, which fills the wound almost as rapidly as it is wiped out, but ceases upon the liga- ture being tied, and probably depends upon the injury of a small branch happening to come off at the part. The edges of the wound should be brought together with a couple of stitches, and lightly dressed. / After this operation, there is a greater difficulty to be en- /countered, in the establishment of an adequate channel for the blood by the anastomosing branches, than occurs in most other cases, as the perforating and external circumflex branches of the profunda pour their contents into those of the articular arteries, and these rising fi'om the popliteal portion of the vessel, which becomes obstructed by the coagulation that follows the operation, must transmit the blood into other branches communicating lower down with the unimpeded arteries of the leg. The limb, therefore, should be protected from cold, and also from any sort of excitement. If it is wished to tie the femoral artery below the crossing of the sartorius, an incision should be made in the middle of the thigh, commencing about three inches lower than where that for the former %)eration terminates. The external or fibular edge of the sartorius being exposed, should be drawn inwards, when a strong tendinous fascia passing from the vastus externus to the triceps will be brought into view; and when it has been divided, the sheath wiU appear, containing the artery and vein, in the same relative situation as they were at the other part of their course. The operation should then be completed as already described. Though the ligature of the femoral artery is not attended with much difficulty, it is frequently followed by bad conse- quences. It has long been my conviction that these depend upon the operation being considered too easy, and therefore con- ducted without sufficient attention being paid to the circum- stances above mentioned, in regard to exposing the arteiy and avoiding the vein. In my own practice, as already stated, T117 BLOOD-VESSELS. have had occasion to tie the femoral artery thirty-three times, and never experienced any troublesome effects from the operation. Ligature of the Arteries below the Knee. Aneurism hardly ever occurs below the knee from internal causes; but wounds not unfrequently occasion hemorrhage, which requires the arteries concerned to be tied. In such cases, it is necessary to secure the injured vessel not only above the aperture, but also below it, since the anastomosing branches would otherwise maintain the bleeding. The posterior tibial may be exposed by making an incision along the inner margin of the tibia, commencing opposite to the insertion of the sartorius, and running three or four inches down- wards. The knee being bent, and the foot extended in order to relax the gastrocnemius, the origin of the soleus from the tibia should be brought into view and divided, when the operator may pass his finger down to the arterj'', which lies somewhat more than a finger's breadth from the edge of the tibia, immediately under the fascia, that covers the deep-seated muscles, and then apply ligatures. But in operating for a wound of the vessel, it is always better to enlarge the existing incision than to make a new one. The arter}' might, if necessary, be tied very easily at the ankle. An incision about a couple of inches long should be made between the inner ankle and tendo Achillis, rather nearer the former than the latter ; two layers of fascia, which are the continuations of the superficial one lying immediately under the integuments, and the deep one that covers the blood- vessels, nerves, and deep-seated muscles, with more or less intermediate cellular substance and fat, must next be divided, and then the artery is found lying with its two verm comites on the tibial side of the neiTe. The plantar arteries are sometimes cut, and would be tied with great diflBculty, owing to the cellular and fatty textures which cover them being so thick and dense, especially when infiltrated with blood; but it is fortunately un- necessary to secure them in this way, as pressiire properly applied is always sufficient for the purpose. The lint ought toPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 118 rest directly upon the orifice of the bleeding vessel, and there- fore, as has abeady been remarked, the wound should be dilated, if not wide enough to admit of its introduction. The anterior tibial artery is liable to wounds at various parts of its course, and may be tied throughout almost the whole of it. This is not required below the ankle, as pressure is equally efficient, and much more convenient; but it may be necessaiy to apply ligatures higher than this. The vessel is not apt to be wounded further up than the middle of the leg, where the thick- ness of the muscles protects it. As it runs close to the inter- ^ osseous ligament, and along the fibular side of the tibialis anticiLs, ) it may be always easily found by making an incision about two inches and a half long, at such distance from the outer margin of the tibia as will allow room for this muscle, and then cutting down in the first muscular interstice. The peroneal artery is so securely defended by the various parts wliich surround it on aU sides, that it can hardly be injured without a very serious wound of the leg; and in the rare case of its hemoiThage requiring particular attention, instead of per- forming a very severe operation to apply the ligature, it would probably be better to enlarge the wound, if necessary, introduce graduated compresses, and support the limb with a bandage applied from the toes upwards. Femoral, Inguinal, and Iliac Aneurism. Aneurism of the femoral artery sometimes occurs just before it passes through the sheath of the triceps, in which case the vessel ought to be tied above the crossing of the sartorius, as has been described for popliteal aneurism : or if the aneurism is the result of a recent punctured wound, the old operation may be performed ; as there wiU be no reason to deem the arterial coats unsound, and the vessel lies favourably for the purpose. A tourniquet having been applied, the cavity is to be laid open, the fluid and coagulable blood sponged out, and the orifice being detected, two ligatures must be tied, one above and the other below the injured part. But if the case is of some standing, it119 BLOOD-VESSELS. will be better to perform the ordinary operation. I did so on one occasion with perfect success. The disease not unfrequently appears at the groin, being seated in the common femoral artery above its bifurcation,—and then constitutes a tumour, which fills more or less completely the triangular hollow that exists at this part of the thigh, and is apt to be mistaken for a chronic abscess. The proper remedy is ligature of the external iliac ; and Mr. Abernethy had the merit of executing this bold attempt for the first time (ISO-i), having previously tied the artery in another case on account of hemorrhage (1796). Both the patients who were the subjects of these operations died; but his next case (1806) was more fortunate. Mr. Freer of Birmingham, much about the same time, but rather earlier, met with complete success. Since then, the ligature of the external iliac has been practised so frequently and successfully that it is now regarded as an ordinary proceeding. The operation consists in making an opening through the ab- dominal parietes above Poupart's ligament, pushing aside the peritoneum, and then tying the artery, which is thus brought into view, or at aU events within reach of the aneurism-needle. The incision for this purpose ought to run nearly parallel with Poupart's ligament, but slightly diverging from it in proceeding upwards, so as to be about the distance of an inch from the superior spinous process. It should be between three and four inches long, and. placed lower down or further up, according to the situation of the tumour, so as to let the Ligature be applied at some distance from the sac. Generally speaking, the lower end of the incision ought to be about half an inch above the middle of Poupart's ligament. The surgeon may cut through the integuments and tendon of the external oblique, as it is usually called, without any ceremony; but iu dividing the internal oblique and transverse muscles, he should use the pre- caution of raising their fibres with the forceps, before cutting them; and having thus exposed a portion of the fascia trans- versalis, he may readily dilate to what further extent seems120 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. necessary, by means of a probe-pointed curved bistoury, guarded with. Ms fore-finger. Gently scratching tbrough this fascia, which, near the crest of the nium, does not adhere intimately to the peritoneum, he will be able to push that membrane in- wards, and introduce his finger down to the artery which runs along the inner side of the psoas magmcs, loosely connected with the vein. If the aneurism-needle is assisted by the counter pressure of a finger placed opposite its point, hardly any dissec- tion will be required for detaching the vessel, and if the con- vexity of the instrument is turned towards the peritoneum, the risk of woimding it or the vein will be diminished ; but in this particular the surgeon must be guided by his own convenience. If any considerable branch of the eircumflexa ilii is cut during the operation, it ought to be secured. The edges of the wound should be stitched together, and lightly dressed. Sir A. Cooper recommended another mode of operating, which was certaiiily in some respects easier, but objectionable on several grounds, par- ticularly in so far as it exposed the vessel too low down, in the neighbourhood of the disease, the lymphatic glands, and the origins of the epigastric and circumflex arteries. This method was, to make a curved incision, having its convexity downwards, and nearly in the direction of Poupart's ligament^ beginning over the margin of the external inguinal aperture, and terminating near the spinous process, then to cut through the tendon of the external oblique muscle, so as to expose the spermatic cord, which being pushed upwards, along with the muscles lying over it and the peritoneum under it, afforded room for applying the ligature. The Internal Iliac has, on one or two rare occasions, been tied on account of aneurisms of the glutteal and ischiatic arteries affecting these vessels after issuing from the sacro-ischiatic notch. The operation is to be performed in the same way as that for the ligature of the external iliac, the incision being merely carried further upwards, and made somewhat longer. . The external iliac wiU form a good guide to the internal, which separates from the other at the sacro-iliac sjTichondrosis. The ureter crosses the^ BLOOD-VESSELS. 121 vessel at this part, and might, through want of caution, be included in the ligature. The Common Iliac can require to be tied only on account of wounds or aneurisms extending up the external iliac. Wounds of the common iliac, from balls or thrusts of sharp-pointed weapons, gi-anting that they were not attended with any other fatal injury, would very seldom afford the time and opportunity necessary for applying a Ligature, owing to their profuse hemor- rhage ; and where the aneurismal sac extends up into the pelvis, it generally adheres so intimately to the peritoneum as must render the ligature of the common iliac, without injuring this membrane, all but impossible. Dr. Mott of New York, never- theless, succeeded in tying the vessel successfully. The aneurism reached far into the pelvis, but he managed to separate the peritoneum from its sac, so as to expose the artery, and pass a ligature round it. He made an incision about six inches long, extending liigher up than the one requisite for tying the internal iliac artery, and found great assistance from thin wooden spatu- las, which were employed to hold aside the peritoneum with the intestines. The aorta is occasionally found, on dissection of dead bodies, to be very narrow, or altogether impervious, either in conse- quence of original malformation, or owing to the complete ■spontaneous coagulation of large aneurisms in its course. In these cases the blood seems to be conveyed to the parts below the obstruction, chiefly by means of the anastomoses between the lumbar arteries, and those of the intestines. If, therefore, the aorta could be tied without the infliction of a mortal wound, there is reason to believe that a cure might thus be accomplished in aneurisms ascending too high for being remedied by ligature of the iliac. In dogs and other animals having long and thin loins, it is not difficult to tie the arteiy, by making a longitu- dinal incision between the lumbar and abdominal muscles, and turning aside the peritoneum. In the human subject, there is not room enough for proceeding in this way, and the only prac- ticable method seems to be that first adopted by Sir A. Cooper,122 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. as a foiiorn-hope, in a case where the patient was reduced to the very point of death by hemorrhage from an iliac aneurism. He cut through the parietes of the abdomen iu the linea alba, turned aside the intestines, cut through the peritoneum again, and tied the vessel. This operation may be performed without much dif&culty, but it does not seem probable that the compli- cated dangers attending the double wound of the peritoneum, the handling of the iutestiaes, and the shock caused to the sys- tem by suddenly impeding the circulation of the great arterial trunk, would leave the patient any chance of recovery. Sir A. Cooper's patient lived thiity-eight hours, and the circulation of the sound limb returned. His death was ascribed to its not doing so in the affected one, which was probably owing to the great extent of the aneurism obstructing a long tract of the artery and its branches, and consequently requiring the blood to be transmitted through many successive anastomoses. If the aneurism ascends too high for ligature of the common iliac, instead of resorting to the desperate expedient of tying the aorta, it would be better to lay open the sac, and secui'e the arterial orifice, which will probably be found considerably lower than the confines of the cavity. In a case where the tumour reached to the bifurcation of the aorta, I adopted this plan, and tied the external iliac just below its origia from the common trunk, the hemorrhage being completely suppressed by a clamp with which Professor. Lister of Glasgow supplied- me for the purpose. Ligature of the Arteries of the Superior Extremity. Aneurism seldom if ever occurs below the axilla, except as a consequence of wounds, and then, of course, has its sac formed entirely by the cellular substance exterior to the vessel. This used to happen most frequently at the bend of the arm when bleeding was in fashion, owing to the lancet being used in- cautiously, so as either to transfix the median basilic vein, and puncture the humeral artery which lies under it, or to open the radial or ulnar arteries instead of veins, which, when coming off123 BLOOD-VESSELS. high and running superficially, they very much resemble. If either of these disagreeable accidents were to occur, strong pres- sure should be exercised over the wound—a bandage being ap- plied tightly from the fingers upwards to support the arm in bearing it. If one of the smaller arteries is concerned, this treat- ment will probably prevent the formation of an aneurism, and if the trunk of the humeral itself is wounded, though the chance of its doing so will be much less, there is stiU room for hope. Even after an aneurism has formed in this situation, the treat- ment by rest and pressure of the whole limb, sometimes effects the cure, and therefore a trial should be made of these means. If they fail, it then becomes necessary to resort to the ligature, and it ought always to be applied, here as elsewhere, in the case of a wounded artery tqjtlig^v^ssel actually injured, and not to the trunk from which it proceeds. The best way of proceeding is to lay the sac fairly open—to evacuate its contents—and then to apply a couple of ligatures, one above, and the other below the opening. Should it ever be thought necessary to tie the humeral above the elbow, the operation may be performed by making an in- cision two inches and a half in length along the inner edge of the biceps muscle. The artery will be found lying on the radial side of the median nerve, strictly connected with its wnce comites, and covered by the humeral vein. When the arteries of the fore-arm happen to be wounded, they ought to be tied at the injured part. The radial is found in the first muscular interspace next the radius, and the ulnar in the first muscular interspace next the ulna. Wounds of the hands and wrist are frequently attended with profuse hemorrhage, for which the humeral artery is sometimes tied. But the fact of this operation checking the bleeding, proves that the case did not require it, since, if the hemorrhagic ten- dency were strong, it could not be subdued by a ligature so far distant from the wound, and with so many branches intervening. In all these cases, pressure, if properly applied, will be found perfectly sufficient for the purpose.PRINCIPLES OF SUEGEllY. 124 Axillary Aneurism. Next to the ham and groin, the axilla is the most common seat of spontaneous external aneurism. It generally begins in the form of a small circumscribed tumour, formed by the external coat of the artery, and after increasing for a time gradually, suddenly enlarges upon rupture of the sac. It then not only fills the axillary cavity, but projects beyond it. The first attempt to cure the disease in this situation by operation was made by PeUetan (1786), who proposed to divide the clavicular origin of the Pedoralis major, and thus expose the subclavian artery where it passes out below the clavicle. His colleagues withheld their consent, and would sanction only a dive with the needle after the integuments were divided. Tliis ineffective and dangerous attempt was tried, and of course proved unsuccessful. Mr. Keate afterwards succeeded by executing the proposal of Pelletan (1800) so far as regarded the division of the pectoral muscle, but he also then plunged his needle in search of the artery. Mr. Chamberlayne operated more properly (1815) by dividing the muscle, and then dissecting down to the vessel. This operation is difficult, owing to the depth of parts—the troublesome hemorrhage proceeding from branches of the thoracica humeraria that lie in the way—the subclavian vein overlapping the artery—and the close proximity of the large nerves going to form the axillary plexus, which are apt to impose upon the surgeon, and be mistaken for the artery. It is also seldom admissible, owing to the height to which the disease generally extends upwards. The best mode of performing it, would be to make an incision along the lower margin of the clavicle, from the coracoid process to near the sternum, and then another about the same length, proceeding downwards from the acromial extremity of the former, in the direction of the space^ between the deltoid and pectoral muscles. The clavicidar origin of the latter being then divided, and any arterial, branch that bleeds considerably having been tied, the surgeon dissecting down125 BLOOD-VESSELS. Qu the acromial side of the plexus of vessels and nerves, in order to avoid the vein, will find the artery, and be able to include it in the ligature. The subclavian artery can be much more easily and advanta- geously tied above the clavicle, immediately after it passes out behind the scalenus anticus, where it is more superficial, detached from the vein, and at a greater distance from the disease. Mr. Eamsden had the merit of first performing the operation here (1808); and, though the case terminated imfavourably, it led to others, which have established this as the best mode of proceed- ing for the purpose. Dr. Post of New York met with the first instance of success (1817). The method of operating described by Mr. Eamsden has hardly been improved. The patient being placed on his back with the head rather lower than the trunk, and his shoulder having been depressed as much as possible, an incision should be made along the upper edge of the clavicle, from the insertion of the steruo-mastoid to that of the trapezius. Another cut, per- pendicular to the former, and of about the same length, ought next to be carried from its centre upwards, parallel with the external edge of the sterno-mastoid. The flaps thus formed should be reflected with the platysma myoides and fat—the jugular vein being, if possible, avoided or held aside; and then the surgeon dissecting down to the lower edge of the inferior belly of the omo-hyoideus, exposes the scalenus anticus, taking care not to cut the supra-scapular artery, which must be tied if wounded. Tracing this muscle to its insertion into the first rib, he is led infallibly to the artery which passes out behind it, immediately above its attachment. He then either carries the needle round the vessel where thus exposed, or, in case of its shewing any sign of morbid alteration, uncovers it a little further, by cutting or turning back the edge of the scalenus—in doing which there is no danger of injuring the phrenic nerve, as it lies here quite at the sternal edge of the muscle, having crossed it obliquely in descending from the cervical plexus. It appears from the cases on record, that the large nerves goingrillNClPLES OF SURGERY, 126 to constitute the axillary plexus, thougli not lying in the way of the artery, are apt from their proximity to be mistaken for it; wherefore the surgeon should be cautious in passing the ligature, and not tie it until satisfied, by the effect of compressing what he has included, that it is really the artery. Notwithstanding the superiority of this proceeding over those which were previously employed for ligature of the subclavian artery, there can be no doubt that the operation is not merely very difficult, but also very dangerous, since it has been found in the recorded cases of its performance, that fuUy a half of the results were fatal from secondary hemorrhage, deep seated sup- puration, and other bad effects. It would therefore seem better in this situation to prefer the old operation, for which the vessel is very conveniently situated, since, if not found to admit of being tied within the confines of the sac, it may be exposed quite up to the clavicle by dividing the superjacent muscles. That this artery may be safely tied at the seat of rupture, is proved by the facts that I have with perfect success twice amputated at the shoulder joint for axillary aneurism which did not admit of any other remedy, and twice operated by laying open the sac ; while the hemorrhage may be completely prevented by malcing an incision at the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid, so as to admit the finger of an assistant, and allow it to press upon the vessel when it rests on the first rib. Carotid Aneurism. The carotid artery at the angle of the jaw, where it divides into its two great branches, occasionally becomes the seat of aneurism, which is easily recognised by the general characters. Sir A. Cooper first ventured to tie the common carotid for this disease (1805); and though the attempt did not succeed, he re- peated it successfully not long afterwards (1808). Since then the artery has been secured very frequently, on various accounts, and with so little difficulty or bad consequences, that the opera- tion is regarded as one of ordinary interest. The patient should be placed on his back with the head Iom-BLOOD-VESSELS. 127 —or at all events on a level with the trunk. The external incision should be two inches and a half long, or more if the patient's neck is thick. It should extend along the internal or sternal edge of the sterno-mastoid, and be more or less distant from the sternum, according to the part of the vessel which it is wished to tie. The artery lies most superficially in the higher part of the n'&ck, where it is covered merely by the integuments, platysvia myoides, and fascia. Lower doAvn it is overlapped by the sterno-mastoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and is crossed by the omo-hyoid. The upper part of its course, therefore, would be preferable for the purpose ; but as the disease or injury which re- quires the ligature is generally seated here, the surgeon has seldom any choice, and must in general operate at or below the crossing of the omo-hyoid. The edge of the sterno-mastoid having been brought into view, should be held aside, so as to expose the ascending belly of the omo-hyoid, which in its turn being turned either up or down, accordingly as it is desired to tie the vessel above or below it, of which plans the latter is usually preferable, the sheath of the vessel will present itself. It ought to be opened on the tracheal side, to avoid the descendens noni, which runs down the centre, and, what is of more consequence, to prevent any risk of injuring the internal jugular vein, which lies on the outer side, and overlaps the artery. The par vagum being situated behind the vessels, is hardly in the way of harm. The convexity of the needle ought to be turned towards the vein. In a case of traumatic carotid aneurism at the lower part of the neck, which extended to the sternum, and therefore pr^;^ eluded the possibility of applying a ligature below the tumour, I punctured the sac so as to admit my finger, and having thus detected the arterial orifice, closed it by pressure while I laid the cavity freely open, sponged out its contents, and tied the vessel above as weU as below the apenturc. The result was completely successful, and saved not only the patient's life, but also that of his assailant who inflicted the wound. The bold operation of tying the arteria ynominata was first performed by Dr. Mott (1818), on account of subclavian aneurism.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 128 The ligature separated on the fourteenth day, and everything seemed to be going on favourably, when a week afterwards, bleeding commenced from the wound, and recurred from time to time, until the patient's strength was completely exhausted, wMch happened on the twenty-sixth day after the operation. G-raefe tied the artery (1822) with a similar result. The ligature separated, and the patient seemed to be safe, but di?d at the end of two months from hemorrhage. It thus appears, that when a ligature is applied so very near the heart, the danger of bleeding continues longer than in other situations, owing probably to the great force of the blood which issues directly from the heart tending to break through the weak and recently-formed obstruc- tion. Perhaps the danger might be diminished by weakening the action of the patient's system by depletion and abstinence for some time after the ligature is detached. The operation, though important and dangerous, is not very difficult. Two incisions should be made of nearly equal length, which may be about two inches—one upwards from the sternum along the inner edge of the sterno-mastoid, and the other trans- versely, from the same point across the sternal attachment of this muscle. The flap of skin thus formed being reflected, the sternal attachments of the sterno-mastoid, stemo-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, must be divided to a sufficient extent for bringing into view the sheath of the vessels, which ought to be opened as if for the ligature of the carotid. This vessel having been exposed, if traced down, will lead to the inominata, round which the needle should be passed very carefully, in order to avoid the pleura and great venous trunk. The Temporal artery, from its exposed situation, is liable to be wounded. I have twice met with a small circumscribed aneurism of this vessel originating from external violence with- out the infliction of a wound. In such a case, the best mode of procedure is to make an incision through the skin, and dissect or puU out the sac completely, so as to leave merely the orifices of the vessel, which may then be tied as usual. Hemorrhage from wounds, whether intentionally or accidentally inflicted may in129 BLOOD-VESSELS. general be suppressed by carefully-employed pressure—a piece of cork wrapped in lint being applied over the part, and secured firmly in its place by a narrow roller, carried round the head and crossed repeatedly over the compress; but if the bleeding has not been effectually restrained at first, it becomes more obstinate from its continuance, by distending the cellular sub- stance, and impeding the effect of external pressure. In these circumstances, there should be no hesitation in cutting through the seat of the injury in the direction of the vessel, separating the integ-uments a little on each side, and then passing a ligature under the artery by means of a sharp needle, first on one and then on the other side of the breach. Aneurism by Anastomosis. Mr. John Bell described, under the title of Aneurism by Anastomosis, a subcutaneous tumour, which possessed a flattened shape, a doiTghy consistence, and a cellular structure, communi- cating very freely with the branches of neighbouring arteries, so that it pulsated or throbbed obscurely, and bled profusely when opened by incision, though when the morbid structure was cut entirely out there was not any more hemorrhage than might have been expected from the vessels of the part. Mr. Bell regarded this formation as composed of cells with which the veins and arteries freely communicated, and into which the blood was induced to flow with extraordinary force. The tendency of aneurism by anastomosis beiag to enlarge, open, and bleed, Mr. Bell recommended complete and speedy excision as the only and essential remedy. More recent and extended observation has not only thrown light upon the nature of this tumour, but also proved that there are others of an analogous kind which should be arranged along with it; and the term of Morbid Erectile Tissue has been em- ployed as the general title for this purpose. Every part of the capillary system probably has the power of inducing blood to enter it, and those portions of the body which, being distinguished by a remarkable degree of this property, are said to be formed KPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, 130 by erectile tissue, as the penis, nipple, or wattles of the turkey- cock, in all probability exercise a similar power in a similar manner, but only on a greater scale, proportioned to the develop- ment of their structure. Instead, therefore, of being constituted by distinct cells interposed between the veins and arteries, they consist merely of the capillary vessels dilated. In some animals the natural erectile tissue is evidently formed in this way, as, for instance, the glans penis of the ram and fallow-deer, and there are a few cases recorded in which the morbid erectile tissue was no less distinctly composed of dilated and convoluted vessels. \^ Under the head of Morbid Erectile Tissue may be ranged— Aneurism by anastomosis and Neevus. Aneurism by anastomosis is almost always seated in the texture lying under the skin, which is more or less elevated, and in general slightly discoloured, having a blue or purple shade observable in it. The swelling throbs synchronously with the heart, becomes smaller when compressed, and more turgid when the circulation through the arteries is excited, or that through the veins impeded. At birth it is usually small, frequently hardly perceptible, and sometimes does not enlarge until puberty. After becoming active it generally increases in size, at length opening, bleeds from time to time. Its most common situations ^ are the head, neck, hands, and- feet. The best remedy for this disease is ^gxcision; and in performing the operation, it is proper to cut quickly and completely beyond the morbid structure. The ligature also may be employed, care being taken to embrace the whole extent of the disease—since a troublesome or even fatal hemorrhage may otherwise result. The arteries leading to the diseased part becoming much enlarged and tortuous, have repeatedly suggested the trial of attempting to afford relief by tying them, but in no case with success. Ligature of the arterial trunks, as the carotid in aneurism by anastomosis of the face or scalp, has also, for the most part, proved unavailing, though in some instances the result proved more satisfactory. The carotid artery has been tied with success in various cases of swelling in the orbit, which seemed to be of this nature ; but as they wereBLOOD-VESSELS. 131 not of congenital origin, tliey must be regarded as questionable exceptions from the general rule. Ngevus is an enlargement of the venous capillaries, wliich may be confined to the surface of the cutis or affect the sub- cutaneous texture. There is little swelling, but very obvious discoloration, generally of a red or purple hue. There is no pulsation, but turgescence when the circulation is disturbed, especially by any circumstances which obstruct the passage of the veins. The disease is most frequent in the head and trunk, but also appears on the extremities. It is always congenital; and when first observed is usually of very small extent, being merely a point or speck, which increases rapidly after birth. After attaining a certain size, it generally either remains sta- tionary, disappears by absoi-ption, or ulcerates and scabs away by. degrees. The treatment ought to vary according to cu'cum stances. If the nsevus is stationary, and not inconvenient, it ought not to be meddled with. If increasing, or so situated as to occasion deformity, it ought to be cut out or removed by ligature—two or more threads being passed under its base, as will be more particularly explained immediately, and tied tightly, so as to effect complete strangulation. The application of pressure and astringent washes, and also local irritation, such as that pro- duced by vaccination, in order to cause absorption or the ulcer- ating and the scabbiag process, are not only very uncertain and ineffectual, but apt to leave unseemly marks, hardly less objec- tionable than that for the removal of which they are employed. When the nrevus is small and superficial, it may be removed by punctures with a pin dipped in nitric acid. The subcutaneous nsevus exists either alone, or, more gene- rally, along with the superficial ntevus; lOce which, it seems to depend more upon the veins than the arteries. It occurs in the same parts of the body, and is always congenital. At the time of birth it occasionally has attained a large size, and soon after- wards begins to bleed profusely. But much more frequently it increases slowly from a veiy small commencement, and may notPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 132 prove troublesome until a pretty advanced period of life. It is recognised by its bulk and extension under the skin, together with the negative character of wanting pulsation. Like the superficial ntevus, it occasionally shrinks or ulcerates away. Wlien this tumour is seated on the face, is rapidly increasing, or threatens to bleed, it ought to be removed without delay; and though excision may, in some cases, be practised with ad- vantage, as when the base is small, so that the wound required admits of healing by the first intention, in general, or rather nearly always, the ligature affords the most eligible means of removal. If the disease can be completely embraced in two ligatures, nothing more is necessary than to pass a needle carry- ing a double thread from one side of the base to the other, and then tie the two halves as tightly as possible. It frequently happens, from the extent or form of the nsevus, that four liga- tures are required, and then two needles should be employed,— one being passed through the base, but not carried further, untQ the other conveys its thread fairly through, by which means any risk of cutting the ligatures by the sharp edge of the second needle is avoided. In this case the tying of the threads, though facilitated by the morbid surface being divided into smaller portions for inclusion, is rendered complicated and troublesome by their numbers, as well as the circumstance that any two cannot be rendered secure until they are tied on both sides, whence it is necessaiy that, while one of the knots is made, the other ends of the threads must be either held or tied at the same time by an assistant. The ligatures should be tied in what is called the surgeon's knot—that is, by having the ends crossed twice, which prevents slipping until the fastening is made good. If still more ligatures are required, they must be introduced and secured on the same principle. Thus in a case of large pendulous naevus, occupying nearly the whole of one side of the face, I employed upwards of twenty. On such occasions, the best way of proceeding is to pass successive portions of a long thread again and again by means of a needle with an eye in its point, and fixed in a handle.BLOOD-VESSELS. 133 Mr. Listen has recommended, that, in applying ligatures for the removal of erectile tumours, the integuments covering them should be divided by a crucial incision, and reflected so as to let the diseased structure alone be removed, in order to hasten the process, and save the sound skin. In a case of this disease in an infant, where the tumour was large and bleeding, Mr. Wardrop, in order to save the life of the patient from immediate danger, tied the carotid artery; and with success. He was induced to foUow this course by the unfortu- nate result of an attempt to cut out the nsevus in a similar case, where the child died during the operation. It would probably be safer practice, in such circumstances, to apply ligatures. Aneurismal Tumour of Bone. Tumours originating from the osseous tissue, and presenting the characters of aneurism, are not unfrequently met with. For the most part they consist of a soft yielding substance, wlaich diminishes in bulk under pressure, and possesses an expansive pulsation in consequence of its vascular texture. The characters derived from this source vary extremely in degree, and are some- times so distinctly marked as to siinulate_an^enrism_beyond the possibility of diagnosis, except from its situation. In such cases there is of course no means of remedy unless through removal. But it is believed from the record of some apparently well- authenticated instances, that there may also be found in bone tumours of a more truly aneurismal nature, in which there is merely a cavity containing blood proceeding from the ruptiu'e of arterial branches, and, therefore, amenable to ligature of the tiunk. While not prepared to deny the possibility of such a condition, I must regard it as extremely rare, having never met with a single example of its occurrence in the course of a long practice. The nearest approach to it which ever fell under my observation was that of a case related by Mr. Listen where he removed a portion of the scapula for a tumoiu- seeming to consist of blood contained in a cavity formed by the expanded peri- osteum ; but even here the disease returned in an unequivocal134 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. form of cerebriform growth. If an Osteo-aneurism, as it lias been calleil, were really to occur, and admitted of distinct recog- nition, ligature of tbe arterial trunk would be worthy of a trial. VEINS. Inflammation of Veins. The veins are more numerous and capacious than the arteries, whence the blood moves through them more slowly and less forcibly. The veins not only communicate by capillary anasto- mosis of their neighbouring branches, but are frequently united in their course ; and hence occasion less inconvenience by their obstruction than that of the arteries does. When the principal trunk of a limb is concerned, the resistance which is opposed to the return of the blood causes more or less swelling. The coats of the veins resemble those of the arteries, but are thinner, more closely connected, and tougher, so that a ligature merely draws them together without cutting the internal ones. The veins are prone to inflammation, which is very much dis- posed to spread, and chiefly in the course of the circulation. The vein affected feels hard and painful, especially when extended. The surface of the skin which covers it is often red, from the ad- jacent tissues taking on the same action. The pain is of a peculiar, oppressive, sickening kind, similar to that which attends inflammation of the glands and absorbents. When these local symptoms are at all acute, they are accompanied with more or less fever, which is distinguished by characters indicative of extreme irritation, whence it is usually named irritative Fever. The pulse is quick and small; the respiration hurried and anxious ; the countenance contracted and expressive of distress; the tongue dry and brown. There is great prostration of strength, and often, especially in the progress of the disorder, delirium. Acute inflammation of the veins, and more especially those of large size, almost always proves fatal. Death may ensue in a few days, but seldom before the end of a week. On dissec- tion, the vein is found thickened in its coats, and containing coagulated blood, or pus, or a mixture of both. There are also135 BLOOD-VESSELS, very generally purulent effusions, in tlie cavities of the chest, those of the joints, or in the subcutaneous cellular texture, to- gether with deposits in the substance of the lungs, very similar in appearance to tubercles. The explanation of these effects has not yet been well made out; but the opinion generally received at present is, that the pus suffers absorption into the mass of cir- culating fluid, and thus produces the effects in question. In proportion as the inflammation is chronic, the danger is small. The local effects are, in the first instance, redness and thickening of the vessel, then suppuration into the cavity, or the effusion of lymph, which, together with coagulation of the blood, just as happens in the arteries in similar circumstances, impedes the cir- culation, and obliterates the channels affected. The veins are induced to take on the adhesive action by compression, and the other kinds of irritation which occasion it in the arteries, but they are much more readily excited by these means to inflame. The atheromatous and calcareous degenerations occur so rarely in their coats, that they may almost be said never to affect them. The causes which have most effect and are most frequently concerned in the production of inflammation in the veins, may be referred to: immoderate or long-continued distension, and the infliction of wounds which do not heal by the first intention. John Hunter, who had the merit of directing attention to the causes and important consequences of venous inflammation, when they were almost entirely overlooked, observed that the veins running near parts which had suffered inflammation and suppu- ration took on a similar action, and effused pus or lymph, or both, into their cavities. Succeeding inquiry has ascertained that this is not a constant, or even very common occurrence ; and it is possible that he may have sometimes mistaken the effect for the cause, the abscesses in the cases he observed being perhaps the consequence of venous inflammation, and not the origin of it. Of all the causes which induce inflammation of veins, there is none more certain than the infliction of a wound which does not heal by the first intention. When the wound does not Ileal by the first intention, it must of course inflame ; and136 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. the morbid action thus instituted is apt to follow its characteristic tendency to spread. John Hunter shewed that many of the bad consequences of venesection, which used to be referred to pricks of the nerves or tendons, really depended on the wound not heal- ing, and the veins inflaming. It is of great consequence to notice that the tendency to venous inflammation varies with the state of the system ; so that while very slight causes may prove suffi- cient to induce it, very severe ones may fail in doing so. Thus in crowded hospitals or other unliealthy situations, a large pro- portion of operations terminate fatally from inflammation of the veins ; and wherever erysipelas abounds, phlebitis is apt to be associated with it. With regard to the treatment, it must be admitted, that when the inflammation is acute, and attended with much constitutional disturbance, it hardly yields to any remedy. In such cases, therefore, the prognosis shotdd be very unfavourable. General bleeding seems to do no good ; and, on the contrary, rather to in- crease the irritability of the system, which more requires calomel and opium. Local bleeding and fomentations are useful when the inflammation is acute. Warm solutions of acetate of lead with opium, and the tinctura saponis mm opio with camphorated mercurial ointment, and the pressure of a flannel bandage, con- stitute the best local applications when the affection is chronic. Wounds of Veins. When veins are cut across, their orifices are closed by the same process which effects the obstruction of arteries in similar circumstances ; and the smaller moving force of their contents favours this occurrence on one side of the aperture, while the valves stiU more effectually prevent any disturbance of the ad- hesive process at the other. If the vein concerned is one of the great trunks, and devoid of valves for preventing a retrograde motion of the blood, pressure ought to be preferred to ligature for restraining its hemorrhage, and a veiy slight resistance will be found sufficient. When veins are not divided, but merely wounded through a part of their circumference, they do not137 BLOOD-VESSELS, necessarily or usually either remain open or suJBfer complete obstruction, as the arteries do, but heal, and regain their original condition. This difference is owing to the smaller distension of the venous coats, wliich allows the effusion of lymph that takes place from their cut edges to become organized. If the lips of the wound continue in situ, they unite at once with each other; but if they are displaced, owing to their transverse direction, or any other cause, there is, in the first instance, injection of blood into the surrounding cellular substance ; then the formation of a firm, round, smooth coagulum, exterior to the wound ; and, lastly, an exudation of lymph from the vessels of the vein, which, resting upon this clot, extends from one cut edge to the other, and gradually unites them together^ after which, the clot being absorbed, the cure is completed. Varix. Varix consists in a dilatation and thickening of the veins, ^ which become at the same time elongated, and thus constitute a S tortuous sweUing. It occasions deformity, weakness of the part concerned, by impeding the circulation, and uneasy sensations from the same cause. It also renders the vein liable to chronic inflammation, ulceration, and hemorrhage. The saphena, sper- matic, and hemorrhoidal veins are most liable to the disease. It seldom appears in the limbs before maturity, but occurs in the ■ other situations which have been mentioned at a much more early age. TaU stature, and largeness of the veins, predispose to the disease; constipation, pregnancy, hepatic derangement, and seden- tary occupations, favour its actual commencement. The treatment of varix consists in obviating the exciting causes, for which purpose the bowels ought to be kept open, the testicle ought to be suspended, and the leg ought to be su];^rted with a bandage or laced stocldng. The horizontal posture ought to be preferred and the erect one avoided. When the vein in- flames, it ought to be treated according to the rules already ex- plained ; the symptoms arc almost always subacute oiT'chronio, and local remedies merely arc required. When it bleeds, pressure138 PKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. must be applied. When ulceration occurs in connection with it, which most frequently happens in the case of varix of the saphena, and affects the inner side of the leg a little above the ankle, the surgeon should be guided in his practice by the indi- cations of indolent or iiritated action which the ulcer may ex- hibit. If there appears not to be any obstacle to the cure on either of these accounts, he may simply use the black wash and a bandage, under which cicatrisation is in general speedily ac- complished. In order to effect a radical cure of varix, it has been proposed to obliterate the vessel above the diseased part, so as to take off the dilating effect of a superincumbent column of blood, and this has been done in various ways. . The ligature, which had been long before tried and rejected on account of the danger attending its use, was recommended by Sir Everard Home, and on his authority tried rather extensively, but with such trouble- some and even fatal consequences, as effectually prevented it from being employed in future. Sir B. Brodie revived a stUl older method—viz., obliterating the vein by incision. Instead of cutting out the varicose portion, which was the ancient practice, he merely divided the vessel, using a narrow knife, and making a small puncture of the skin. The consequences of this practice, though not so disastrous as those of the ligature, were still occasionally disagreeable enough to overbalance the chance of benefit. Another proposal was made by Mr. Mayo— viz., to make an eschar with caustic over the vein at a sound part of its course above the varix, and thus excite such inflam- mation of the vessel as might be sufficient to occasion oblitera- tion of its cavity by the effusion of lymph. This method has the recommendation of being an imitation of a natural process of cure, for it sometimes happens that the varicose vessel, in consequence of spontaneous inflammation, becomes completely impei-vious. In exciting this action artificially, however, there is great difficulty in avoiding the opposite extremes of deficient and excessive irritation, and alarming inflammation has in con- sequence been repeatedly induced. M. Velpeau has more latelyBLOOD-VESSELS, 139 introduced a method of great simplicity and perfect safety, wMch consists in passing a common pin throiigli the sldn, under the vein, while it is compressed and held outwards by a finger and thumb, and then tying a thread tightly round it. A little redness and swelling follow, and -ulceration soon succeeding detaches the pins with hardly any pain, and no danger. It is still questionable, however, whether obstruction of the vein merely at a part of its course is adequate to afford permanent relief; and in the present state of information upon the subject, it seems that the most judicious course in treating varix is to be satisfied with remedying its bad consequences, and using means for preventing their occurrence. Aneurismal Varix. When a contiguous artery and vein are wounded together, it occasionally happens that the orifices of the vessels remaining undisturbed, the blood is allowed to pass from the artery into the vein; the consequence of which is, that the latter vessel \ becomes large and tortuous, communicating a jarring sort of / sensation to the hand which examines it, and a peculiar thrill- ing sound, like the purring of a cat, or the prolonged articulation ). of the letter R (bruit de rape), is heard when the ear is brought near the injured part. Jhe limb becomes oedematous and cold, <- owing to the want of its usual supply of nutritious fluid, the greater part of which, instead of proceeding onwards to its destination, flows back to the heart, and also to the obstacle opposed to the return of the blood from the veins below, by the distension of those above, which is caused-by the forcible current of the artery. From the same caujse there is hardly any pulsation of the artery below the part where it is wounded, while it pulsates above more forcibly than it did before. Dr. Hunter first described this disease (1756), but Dr. Cleg- horn of Dublin suggested the name which is used to denote it (1765). It is most apt to occur at the bend of the arm, where the median basilic vein lies over the humeral artery, but may do so in any part of the body where a largo artery and vein are140 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. contiguous. Instances of it have been obsei-ved in the femoral, popliteal, carotid, and subclavian vessels, from wounds. Aneurismal varix is generally more inconvenient than dangerous, the veins, after they become fuUy distended, usually remaining without any further change. It is, therefore, seldom necessary to do more than apply a bandage to the limb, with a compress over the injured part. Should the swelling, pain, or other symptoms of the case be so severe as to warrant an opera- tion, a radical one may be performed by tying the wounded artery both above and below the opening. Varicose Aneurism. When, in the case of a vein and artery communicating, the blood issues from the latter vessel into the cellular substance, so as to constitute a false aneurism, and at the same time continues to gain access to the vein, a combination of aneurism and aneurismal varix results, which has been named Varicose Aneurism. More correctly, this condition would have the title of Aneurismal Varix, since its peculiarity is not in the aneurism, but in the complication of venous distension by the force of arterial blood. In 1831''^ I put upon record a remarkable case, in which an aneurism of the abdominal aorta communicated with the vena cava; and similar cases of spontaneous injury have since been observed. With few exceptions, the bend of the arm has been the seat of this occurrence, in consequence of wounds. Owing to the free passage which remains for the blood, and the absence of regurgitation or stagnation, there is little or no tendency to coagrdation; and in operating here I have found the interior of the sac perfectly white and smooth, like the inner surface of an artery, ISTo benefit, consequently, would be derived from the simple ligature of the humeral; and the proper course is to lay open the cavity, and apply two ligatures to the vessel, one above and the other below the aperture. But so little inconvenience is usually experienced from the disease, that the better course in general is to abstain from interference. * Contributions to the Pathology and Practice of Surgery, p. 286.141 EXTERNAL INJURIES, CHAPTER IX. EXTEENAL INJURIES. Bruises. By a Bruise is understood an injiiry caused by a blow, or violent compression, witliont division of the integuments. Its effects vary according to circumstances, but tlie one most common is Eccbymosis, or tbe injection of blood into the cellular tissue, which occasions more or less swelling, and discoloration of the skin. The blood, after being thus effused, is gradually removed by absorption, diu'ing which the colour of the part passes through various shades of red, green, and yellow. To promote this absorption, some gently stimulating lotion, containing the salts of ammonia, spirits, and vinegar, ought to be applied, together with moderate pressure. It is usual to apply leeches in the treatment of eccbymosis, but as the blood is not contained within its own vessels, and, on the contrary, is extravasated into the cellular texture, bleeding from the surface cannot possibly be of any service, and may even do harm by increasing the weakness which the skin has previously suffered, both from the immediate effect of the injury, and also by its separation from the parts beneath through the bloody effusion, and thus causing sloughing. The blood is sometimes effused in larger quantity, and col- lected in a cavity formed by the torn and distended cellular substance. In this kind of bruise there is usually the same sort of discoloration of the skin as in the former, but the size and fluctuation of the tumour readily distinguish it. This condition is comprehended under the title of eccbymosis ; but it is neces- sary to make a distinction between the two, though doubtless142 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGEEY. merely different degi-ees of the same injury, since the process of recovery is apt to be considerably different. It is always desirable to promote absorption, and for this purpose the same means as those employed to discuss superficial ecchymosis are proper, especially lotions and pressure. Some- times the serum continues little or not at all diminished, ia which case blisters, succeeded by pressure, ought to be used, and if these means fail, the fluid may be drawn off by a trocar. The contents of these effusions are also apt to shift from one part of the body to another, according to the tendency of their weight. When the effusion is large, or the parts about it have been much injured, or the patient is of an irritable habit, the parietes of the cavity are apt to inflame and convert it into an abscess. Any tendency to this ought to be allayed or prevented by cold applications; but, so soon as there is reason to believe that matter has actually been formed, free vent should be afforded to it and the remaining blood by an incision ; after which pressure and some stimulating wash will promote contraction and closure of the cavity. The appearance of ecchymosis so regularly attends the inflic- tion of bruises, that much importance is frequently attached to its presence or absence in medico-legal investigations. The dis- coloration of the skin caused by it must be distinguished from the livor, which generally appears on the dependent parts of the body after life becomes extinct. This may be readily done by making an incision through the part in question, as the blood in ecchymosis will be found coagulated in the seat of its effusion, while in livor there is merely congestion of the cutis. The time required for ecchymosis shewing itself is also an important point. The more superficial the effusion is, the more quickly will the dis- coloration appear—and according to the difference in this respect, three or four hours, or as many days, will be necessary. It should be recollected that the effusion and discoloration are two distinct things ; that the former happens immediately after the injury, and may be certainly discovered by dissection ; but thatEXTERNAL INJUEIES, 143 the latter, though, whcu present, affording evidence of violence having been sustained, does not prove by its absence that no effusion has taken place. Persons labouring under the disease named Purpura hemorrhagica have often discoloured marks on the skin resembling those of ecchymosis. Blood may be effused into the cellular texture, in consequence of violence sustained soon after death—but in this case it proceeds from rupture of the larger vessels, and is not coagulated. Finally, it is necessary to notice, that the presence of a wound in a bruised part may prevent any discoloration by allowing the blood to escape. Wounds. By Wounds are understood solutions of continuity in the surface of the body effected by violence. They are divided according to the injury which the parts concerned sustain in addition to the wound, and also the form which it possesses, into Incised, Punctured, and Contused. In incised wounds, there is merely a solution of continuity iuflicted by a cutting instrument, vsdthout any other injury of the part concerned, and the superficial extent of the aperture bears a considerable proportion to its depth. The great object in treating such wounds is to induce union by the first intention, and the general observations which have been already made on that process suggest the practice to be followed with this view. All foreign matters should be removed from between the cut surfaces ; blood and serum should be prevented from collecting, by avoiding close dressing ; and the actions of the system should be kept within proper bounds by suitable diet, with perfect quiet of the part affected. Wherever pressure is suificient to keep the cut edges in contact, it ought to be preferred for the purpose. Plasters are apt to approximate the lips of the wound merely, and, so far from pressing the deeper parts of the wound together, rather render them more separable by relaxing the superjacent integuments. The introduction of silver sutures for retaining the cut edges in contact, has with gi-eat advantage superseded all the other means which were previously employed144 PIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. with this view. They afford sufficient support without causing injurious pressure on the textures concerned, and, producing no irritation, may be allowed to remain untU the process of reunion is so firmly completed as to render any further protection unne- cessary. When the superficial extent of a wound is very small in pro- portion to its dej)th, it is said to be pmctui-ed. Such wounds being caused by instruments which have small points and blunt edges, are not formidable in their appearance, but usually turn out much more troublesome than incisions of far greater size, by occasioning extensive inflammation and widely difi"used suppu- ration. These bad consequences of punctures are usually ascribed to their penetrating some texture, which inflames and gives rise to the effects in question; but it seems more reason- able to refer the diffused inflammation occasioned by them, to the confinement of the discharge which necessarily results from their narrow aperture, and the resistance of the fibrous expan- sions which have been injured. The most effectual method of checking the inflammation which proceeds from punctures, consists in dilating the orifice of the wound, and it is, therefore, often recommended to do tlais immediately after their infliction, to prevent bad consequences. It does not appear, however, that the chance of these is thus diminished; and, therefore, the most prudent course is, in the first instance, merely to apply cold water or other lotions proper for moderating action and preventing inflammation. Should it actually commence, dilatation ought to be performed without delay, and then fomentations with poultices are proper for a few days, or imtil the suppurative action is fully established, when compression and moist dressing must be substituted in their stead. Contused wounds are solutions of continuity, in which the surfaces are injured by the violence that occasions them—^the agent being usually some blunt sm-face, which strikes, or on which the body is impelled, with great force. Contused woimds in general bleed less than incised ones; their surface is ragged145 EXTERNAL INJURIES. or lacerated ; aud sometimes of a dark coloiu', owing to effusion of blood into the cellular substance. When the contixsion is considerable, it renders the "wound incapable of uniting by the first intention, and excites inflanmiation, which either ter- minates in mortification or leads to suppuration, according to the extent of the injury aud the irritability of the patient. It was formerly the custom to cut away the contused and lacerated edges, to supersede the more tedious process of sloughing ; but nature is now allowed to determine what portion is incapable of recovery. All foreign matters ought to be carefully removed from the woimd, and its edges should then be placed as nearly as possible in contact. If there is no great degree of contusion, stitches may be employed for this purpose; but, generally speaking, it is better to abstain from them ; and if they are used, any appearance of inflammation should be the signal for then- removal. Cold applications are proper in the first instance, and ought to be continued until the wound either unites or in- flames. In the latter case, warm fomentations and poultices are required; but they must be laid aside as soon as the sloughs have separated, and the granulating action is established. If continued longer than this, they induce relaxation of the parts concerned, already weakened by the injury, render the granula- tions large and flabby, and prevent the sores from contracting. The resulting ulcer always tends to weakness of action, and therefore, instead of these enfeebling applications, requires lotions with pressure. Gun-shot wounds are solutions of continuity effected through the agency of substances impelled by fire-arms. They are gene- rally punctured as to their form, and always contused as to their surface. They are consequently apt to occasion extensive in- flammation, and sloughing of the parts more immediately con- cerned. The orifice by which a ball enters is small, round, depressed, and livid ; that by wliich it escapes, larger, more elongated, and everted at its edges. These appearances vary with the velocity of the ball, the entrance being most, and the exit least distinctly characterised when it is greatest, and vice L146 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. versa. The wound when first received occasions a numb sort of sensation, but before long becomes acutely painful It bleeds less than an incised wound in the same situation would do. Wlien of any considerable extent, it is apt to cause, immediately on its infliction, more or less mental alarm, despondency, and prostration of strength. This constitutional effect is propor- tioned to the im]3ortance of the injury, the weakness of the patient, and his apprehension of danger. The bad consequences of gun-shot wounds were formerly ascribed to a poisonous agency of the gunpowder ; and upon this belief was founded the practice of scarifying or excising the wounded sui-faces, and dressing them with scalding oils. Pare introduced a milder method, which he was led to, in the' first instance, by necessity, and was afterwards confirmed in by expe- rience and reasoning on the subject. He used merety simple unctuous applications, and with such success, that his example was soon generally followed. The treatment of gun-shot wounds, though so far improved, still continued unnecessarily severe, since the scarification, which was formerly practised to remove the poison, still remained in use, to prevent tension and inflam- mation from the fistulous shape of the wound. John Hunter exploded this system of dilatation, as it was called, by shewing that it did not prevent the effects in question, and was performed soon enough if delayed until they actually appeared. The best application at first is a pledget of oiled lint, placed on the woimd, and covered with cold wet cloths. Should inflammation supervene, free dilatation, including any fascia that has been wounded and lies within reach, with fomentations and poultices, become proper; when the sloughs are detached, pressure, with the usual lotions, must be carefully employed, as there are apt to be extensive sinuses ; and if these have not a sufficiently dependent openmg, it ought to be afforded by the knife. When the ball, or any other foreign matter introduced into the woimd, is not earned through, but remains, it ought to be removed, if this can be done without any very serious cutting or searching; for, though it is no doubt true that such extraneousEXTERNAL INJURIES. 147 sixbstances often acquire a fibrous cyst, and cause no disagreeable symptoms, they more frequently excite inflammation, which leads to various troublesome consequences, and may do so after lying for a long while without causing disturbance. The finger is the best probe for detecting the ball or other foreign body ; and when further search is requisite to find it, the nature of the tissues concerned ought to be carefully considered, since the direction of its course is much affected by those of dense and unyielding structure, as the bones, fasciae, and even the skin. The velocity of the ball, and the position of the body when it entered, ought also to be taken into accoimt. When the injury is so severe as to lender amputation necessary, it has been disputed whether the operation ought to be performed immediately, or be delayed until the primary inflammation subsides, and suppuration is established. In reference to this question, the effects of gun-shot wounds may be divided into four stages :—1. Confusion and prostration of strength, commencing immediately after the injury is sustained, and lasting seldom less than one, or more than six hours, unless it terminates in sinking. 2. Eeturn of strength, attended with more composure of mind, and sensation of the injury. This con- tinues until inflammation begins, which is hardly deferred beyond twenty-four hours. 3. Inflammation, ending in death, gangrene, or suppuration, and occupying from one to several days. 4. Suppuration, which continues until the patient re- covers, or has his strength completely exhausted, and dies,— which may be in the course of weeks, or not until the end of months. Amputation may be performed with most advantage in the second and fourth of these stages. Different opinions were formerly entertained as to which of them was preferable ; but the extensive experience of the military surgeons who were engaged in the Peninsular War decided the question ; and it is now admitted that amputation during the second stage is out of all proportion most successful; to say nothing of the risk which men wounded on the field of battle must run, if permitted to go through the inflammatory stage, while their shattered148 PRINCIPLES OF SUROERY. limbs are suLjected to the irritation of rough caniages, and their constitutions injured by the imwholesonie air of crowded hos- pitals. Should the surgeon find that his patient does not rally within the period usually occupied by the first stage, though assisted by the stimulating effect of wine or spirits, he ought still to afford the chance derived from removal of the limb, unless the strength seems at so low an ebb that it woidd cer- tainly sink under the shock of an operation; and, on the same principle, when inflammation has been allowed to come on, and seems proceeding to gangi-ene, amputation ought to be per- formed, as giving the patient a chance, however small, of escape from otherwise certain death. Cannon-balls not unfrequently occasion contusions without any breach of the surface, varying from tlie slightest ecchymosis to complete destruction of the subjacent tissues, so that they are reduced to a gelatinous pulp. Sometimes when the contusion is sustained on the trunk, it caiises instant death, in consequence of important organs being ruptured or otherwise injured. These effects used to be ascribed to the wind of the hall, or the air violently agitated by its motion. They are now more correctly referred to the action of the ball itself, which has had its velocity so far spent as to bruise merely without wounding. Injuries from the Extremes of Cold and Heat. The first effect of cold is to diminish the vital action of the part to which it is applied. This state of depression, when not carried too far or continued too long, is succeeded by more than usual activity, or what is called reaction, especially if heat or any other stimulus co-operates with the natural tendency to excite- ment. If this alternation be frequently repeated, the part con- cerned becomes permanently weakened, being slightly swelled, of a piirple colour, and not so warm as usuaL It is then easily affected by cold, becoming pale, contracted, and numb, and reacts with so much violence as to show symptoms of inflammation, be- coming red, hot, itchy, and painful; not unfrequently vesicated and ulcerated. A part thus injured by cold is named a Chilblain.EXTERNAL INJUKIES. 149 Chilblains are most apt to occur in persons wlio possess weak powers of circulation, especially young females, and on tlie same principle take place chiefly at the extremities of the body, viz., the hands and feet. They ought to be guarded against by avoiding sudden and severe alternations of cold with heat. When formed, they should be protected from cold, and sup- ported in their actions by stimulating embrocations, such as camphorated oil, strong spu'its, or a mixture of tind. sap. c. opio, with tind. lyttce, in the proportion of six of the former to one of the latter. The ulcer of chilblains presents the appearance of a smooth superficial excavation, with thick white edges, and a peculiar viscid slimy discharge. It heals most readily under the unguenium oxydi hydrargyri ritbri. More intense cold not only weakens, but entirely suspends vital action. The part becomes pale, insensible, and shrivelled, and is said to be Frost-hitien. The extremities of the body, such as the fingers and toes, the ears and the nose, are most liable to be thus affected, both from their situation, and comparatively languid circulation. A frost-bitten part is not dead, and when fi-eed from the influence of the cold, regains its power of action. It is difBcult to determine how long the torpor may last without permanently depriving the part^ of life ; but there is reason to suppose that the period is considerable; and it appears from the relation of Sir John Franklin, that an animal may be restored to its usual actions even after its whole body has been frozen. In treating frost-bite, the great object should be to moderate the reaction, since, if it proves excessive, mortification readily occurs, both because the part is weak, and because its u'ritability being consequently increased, the inflammation is apt to be in- tense. Tlie best method is to use friction without any external heat, or even to effect it through a cold medium, such as that of snow, in order to promote the return of circulation, and at the same time guard against excitement. If inflammation comes on, the part ought to be soothed with poiiltices, or anodyne and astringent applications, such as a warm solution of acetate of150 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. lead with opiuni. Local bleediug would increase the weakness, and consequently render the diseased action more unmanage- able ; but general depletion will be proper if the patient is plethoric. Should mortification ensue, the best dressing will be a soft poultice until the sloughs separate. Burns.—"When a part is exposed to higher temperatures than usual, it becomes red, more or less swelled, and hot. If the heat applied is moderate, or of short duration, these symptoms dis- appear when it is removed; but when it is intense, or longer continued, the redness caused by it is bright and permanent, and there is a jpainful sensation of burning. The part is then said to be burnt, wliile in the former case it was merely excited. The inflammation thus induced may terminate ra effusion of serum from the surface of the cutis, which detaches the cuticle, and elevates it into blisters. When the heat is stUl more intense or prolonged, it destroys the life of the part. The cuticle is then detached and thrown iato iiTegular folds, exposing the subjacent cutis discoloured and dry. When the heat operates through the medium of fluids, its effects are named Scalds. Burns and scalds are always paiuful,—often long in heahng, owing to the feeble action of the resulting ulcer, which is seated m parts that have been more or less injured by the heat,—and sometimes fatal by the shock to which they subject the constitution, by the profuse suppuration which they occasion, or by exciting inflam- mation of some internal pait. In treating burns, it is necessary to consider whether the injury is so severe as to destroy the vitality of the part affected, or merely sufficient to induce inflammation of it. In the latter case cold apphcations afford great relief, and if employed imme- diately after the accident occurs, may prevent the inflammation and vesication altogether. Another mode of treatment which answers extremely well, though it is difficult to say on what principle, consists in enveloping the burnt part with cotton. This practice was introduced from America, and is now in very general use. It appears that its good effects are most conspi- cuous when pressure is conjoined with it; and a bandageEXTERNAL INJUKIES. 151 therefore, oiiglit to be applied witli moderate firmness. When blisters rise, the detached cuticle should be not only laid freely open, but taken away altogether, as its presence seems to increase the irritation. If ulcers remain, lotions of sulphate of zinc, or acetate of lead, are required to stimiilate the granulating surface. It was formerly the custom to dress burns with unctuous matters, such as the carron oil, or linimentum aquce calcis; hut these applications are now almost entirely superseded by the means which have been mentioned. When the burn is so severe as to destroy the life of the part, it must always be regarded as a severe injury. In very young or very old subjects, or those who on any other account are very weak, it is apt to induce immediate sinking ; especially when it« affects the trunk, and more particularly the abdomen. In patients whose powers of action are stronger, the local irritation generally occasions very smart symptomatic fever, and when the integuments of the thorax or abdomen are affected, there is a risk of the membranes, lining these cavities internally, inflaming from their contiguity. The constitutional treatment must de- pend upon the circumstances of the case. If the patient is drowsy, with cold extremities and a weak pulse, spuits, wine, and other cordials should be assiduously administered, whUe the body is warmly covered, and sources of artificial heat are applied to the feet. If, on the other hand, the ordinary symp- toms of inflammatory fever should be present, soothing means will be requh-ed. The local treatment of burns has afforded a fruitful field for diversity of practice and opinion, some using cold applications and means of a sedative kind ; while others, as Dr. Kentish, have insisted upon the advantage obtained from employing oil of turpentine, and different stimvilants of this sort. It will be foimd, however, that there is not so much room for doubt and question as may at first appear, since it is only hi what may be called the first stage of burns, or that part of their progress which intervenes between infliction and ulceration, that any uncertainty exists as to the proper mode of treatment. If the injuiy is slight, that is to say, if the part affected still retains152 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. its vitality, I believe that cold apj)lications and cotton will in general prove most useful; and if the textvire of the part be destroyed, there can be notliing better than a poultice, until the sloughs separate. In either case, ulceration sooner or later is established, and then the treatment will be the same for both. Should the patient's strength prove inadequate to support the tedious and exliaustiag process of cure, if the part affected is seated on a limb, it ought to be amputated. Poiso7ks. By poisons are understood agents which have the power of destroying the structure, or inducing disturbance in the actions of the body, independently of mechanical violence and tempera- ture. Those which directly affect the structure are named Escharotic Poisons, or simply escharotics. Of these the most powerful are potass, the concentrated mineral acids, and some metallic salts, as the nitrate of silver, oxymuriate of mercury, and chloride of zinc. They are frequently used intentionally to remove morbid structures, etc., and are then named Caustics. Occasionally, whether from accident or design, they are applied so as to produce serious injury. In such cases, as theu' effect is generally completed before surgical assistance can be procured, the only treatment admissible is that which promotes separation of the slough and healing of the sore. Poultices, until the first of these stages is completed, and then lotions wjth pressure, afford most benefit. 1 Poisons, more strictly speaking, are those agents which pro- 1 duce their effects independently of chemical properties, as well as mechanical force and temperature ; they do not directly alter the structure to which they are applied, but produce such changes in its natural actions as frequently give rise to the most important local and general consequences. A very large propor- tion of the articles comprehended in this class are employed to produce their effects in order to relieve the system from other diseases, whence they are named, not poisons, but medicines,—EXTERNAL INJUEIES. 153 the former title being reserved to denote those which are distin- guished by the potency of their action. The only poisons which present subject for surgical consideration are afforded by the animal kingdom, and may be divided into — 1. Those wlaich exist natiu-aUy in the animals that yield them ; 2. Those which are the results of diseased action ; and 3, Those which depend on changes after death. Natural animal poisons are afforded chiefly by the two classes of Insects and Serpents. In this and other temperate climates, the effects of those of the former are hardly more than local, consisting of pain, swelling, and redness of the part injured. The treatment, when any is judged necessary, shordd also be local; and the solution of muriate of morphia, or that of acetate of lead with opium, aqua ammonim, and other preparations of ammonia, afford most relief There is considerable variety in the effect of these poisons, according to the irritability of the individual on whom they operate ; and habit has a very remark- able influence in lessening it. The poison of serpents produces more serious consequences, which vary according to the species which affords it. The most deadly sort occasions intense local pain, Speedily followed by swelling of the limb, rapidly extending, and attended with mottled livid discoloration of the skin. The patient, almost immediately upon being bitten, feels sick, weak, and confused. • He appears as if intoxicated, vomits, becomes quite insensible, and dies within a few hours, or it may even be minutes, after sustaining the injury. The viper, which is the only poisonous serpent in this country, hardly ever produces fatal effects ; but the pain and swelling caused by its bite are often extremely distressing. The treatment must be both local and general. The former consists in opposing the entrance of the poison into the cii'culation; the latter in counteracting its depressing effect on the vital powers. In accomplishing the first of these objects, the means of most use are—1. Eemoving the poison from the body, either by cutting away the part, or destroying it with caustics or154 PKINCIPLES OF SURGERY, cauteries ;—tlie application of ammonia also seems to have some effect in preventing it from producing its cliaracteristic effects ; 2. Applying a tight ligature on the limb to compress the veins and other absorbent vessels ; and 3. To direct the current of the fluids towards, instead of from, the injured part, by causing suction over it, which may be affected with the mouth, or a cup- ping-glass. One or other of these proceedings may be trusted to chiefly, according to circumstances, but in severe cases it is proper to combine the operation of the whole. The general remedies are such as tend to prevent sinking, by creating a sort of artificial strength through their stimulating property. Ammonia, given pure or in the state of carbonate, with spirits, and warm water, sufficient to make the mixture palatable, ought to be administered every five minutes. Arsenic has been strongly recommended also, as a remedy in such cases ; and although it might be difficult to account for its salutary operation, the facts in proof of it are so striking and well authenticated, that when circumstances permit, this means should certainly be combined with the others. The arsenite of potass, or Fowler's solution, is the most convenient preparation for the purpose, and it has been said that very large doses, even to the extent of two drachms, may be given every liaK hour. The morbid poisons originating in diseased action, which affect the human species, may all be produced by the human body ; ,but two of them, cow-pox and hydrophobia, were in the first instance derived from the lower animals. They exist both in the liquid and in the gaseous state. In the former they hardly act imless inserted or inoculated into the texture of the body. In the latter, they produce their effects when received into the lungs dui-ing inspiration. It is only the first or inocu- lated poisons which belong to. the sm-gical department. They always occasion more or less initation of the part to which they are applied, and generally afterwards more or less constitutional disturbance. Their modus operandi is not at aU Icnown. Tliey seldom cause any immediate local alteration ; and days, or even weeks, may elapse before there is any indication of their action.EXTERNAL INJURIES. 155 The constitutional disturbance follows, and after being fairly- instituted, it cannot be subdued by removing the part on wbicli tbe morbid matter primarily acted. The effect of some of these poisons will be more particularly considered hereafter. At present it may be observed, that the treatment proper for them in the first instance requires to be merely local, and should be conducted on the same principles of prevention, as that of natural poisons. In regard to hydrophobia, it is believed that, if the injured part be cut out, or otherwise removed, any time before the constitutional symptoms appear, the patient wiU. be certainly protected from them. The poisonous effects of dead animal matter are involved in considerable obscurity. It frequently happens that wounds re- ceived ia the dissection of animals after death, whether for anatomical investigation or the preparation of food, are followed by troublesome consequences, both local and general. It is ob- served that those which have a punctured form are most apt to be so. Sometimes there is violent inflammation of one or aU the tissues ia the neighbourhood, from the sldn to the bone, termi- nating speedily in suppuration or sloughing. In the finger this constitutes what is called paronychia or whitlow. The absorbent vessels leading from the injured part often inflame, and by propagating their morbid action to the surrounding tissues, occasion hard painful cords under the skin, and red lines on its surface. Still more frequently the lymphatic glands in the course of the absorbents inflame and suppurate. At other times the patient first complains of cold shivering, headache, and vomitmg of bilious matter, after which the usual symptoms of fever come on, and are generally characterised by extreme irritation—the pulse being excessively qxuck—the respiration veiy hurried— and the countenance unusually expressive of anxiety. Along with this derangement of the system, a diffused inflammatory blush appears in the neighbourhood of the injury, from which it soon extends itself irregularly in various directions, and, termin- ating in mortification, proves fatal within a week or little more ; or the patient may die, as it seems, merely from the exhausting156 PllINCIPLES OF SUliGERY. effect of tlie irritative fever, with very little local appearance of disease. Siace the effects of punctures now mentioned differ from each other very much in kind, and are subject to no less variety in the degree of their severity, while they are aU occasionally produced, so far as can be ascertained, by the same circumstances, it has been inferred that they depend not so much upon a poLsonous influence in the subject dissected, as on peculiar irritability of the individual injured. In regard to the treatment, it may be observed—1. That when punctures occur in suspicious cii-cumstances, they ought to be converted into incisions, sucked, and touched with an escharotic. 2. That persons exposed to such injuries ought to lessen so far as possible, the irritability of their systems. 3. That when the effect is an acute and local inflammation, a free incision through the affected part affords most relief 4, That when the absorb- ents inflame, warm solutions of acetate of lead with opium have the most sootliing influence. 5. That when the lymphatic glands become affected, warm fomentations are the most powerfid means of relieving the patient, which they do either by inducing the inflammation to terminate in resolution, or by hastening suppu- ration if it be inevitable. 6. That when the constitutional distui'bance precedes the local affection, and there are signs of great irritation, scarifications of the inflamed part, followed by hot anodyne fomentations, and accompanied with the internal administration of calomel, opium, and cordials, though they may seldom succeed in curing this most dangerous condition, seem to have more tendency to do so than general bleeding and the antiphlogistic regimen, which by iacreasing the weakness of the patient's system, increase its irritability and render its treat- ment more unmanageable.157 AMPUTATION. CHAPTEE X. AMPUTATION. The expression Amputation, tliongli sometimes applied to tlie excision of parts from tlie trunk, is generally confined in its meaning to the removal of limhs by the knife. In performing this operation, it is not sufficient merely to cut away what is diseased or injured, since the smface that remains ought to be left in such a state as will favour the healing of the wound, and afford a comfortable stump to the patient. Many different modes of operating have been contrived, with the view of attaining these objects; and there is no department of practical surgery into which more improvements have been introduced in recent times. Amputation was anciently performed by the direct and simple process of cutting down at once to the bone, and sawing it through on a level with the soft parts. But as in this way there was no covering ]provided for the bone, whence followed a tedious and imperfect cure, various modifications were introduced to supply the defect. The muscles were drawn up by metallic plates, or pieces of cloth and leather, called retractors. Cheselden (1720) drew back the skin after it was cut, and then divided the mi;scular parts higher up. This method of double incision was caiTied further by Mr. Mynors of Birmingham, who dissected the skin, and turned it back like the sleeve of a coat. Louis cut the muscles by two circular incisions, so as to divide the portion nearest the bone higher up than the external layer. Alanson, by holding liis knife obliquely, while he made the cu-cular sweep through the muscles, cut them at once in the same form that re- sulted from two successive incisions.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 158 The object of all these contrivances was to leave the soft parts sufficiently long to cover the bone ; but this they failed in accomplishing, excepting so far as concerned the skin ; for the muscles being in the first instance cut higher than the integu- ments, and subsequently becoming still more diminished in length by the unopposed effect of their contractility, could hardly be made to meet over the bone, which often protruded during the cure, and required to exfoliate or to be shortened by the saw. Tlie most simple and effectual plan for covering the bones was obviously to form one or more flaps from the part of the limb most able to supply them ; and there can be no doubt that this mode of operating would have come earlier into general use, had it not been that prejudice in favour of the circular in- cision directed the attention of practitioners to its improvement. The operation by flap was performed occasionally during the last century and a half, and recommended by various surgeons who practised it more or less extensively. Lowdham of London seems to have been the first of these (1696), and he was followed by Verduin (1697), Koenerding (1698), Sabourin (1702), and Vermale and Eavaton (1708). Towards the conclusion of last century, it was advocated by several of our countrymen in amputating the leg, of whom may be particularly mentioned Messrs. White (1760), O'Halloran (1765), Hey (1770), and Alanson (1780). The alleged advantages of this method are—1. Tliat it is lauch more quicldy performed, and consequently much less painful to the patient, than the circular incision ; 2. That it cuts the parts smoothly, and leaves them in a state favourable to union; and, 3. That it' affords a better covering for the bones than can be obtained from any modification of the other operation. The flaps may be formed by cutting obliquely inwards to the bone,—by transfixing the limb and cutting outwards,—or by first cutting inwards, so as to obtain one flap, and then outwards to form a second. The particular circumstances of the case often render one of these modes preferable to tl>e others ; but whenAMPUTATION. 159 the surgeon lias liis choice, he will generally find transfixion the easiest method. The size of the flaps, and proportion of muscle and integument composing them, must be regulated by the thickness of the bone, and laxity of the soft parts. The flaps ought to be cut longer than would be sufficient to constitute a well-formed stump in the dead body, to compensate for the con- tractility of the muscles. "VVlien the skin is loose, and the muscles attenuated, the surface of the flaps should be convex, to preserve the latter, and diminish the extent of the former tissue. A^Tien, on the contrary, the limb is muscular, and the skin tense, the knife should be made to describe a concave line, to prevent redundance of muscle. For restraining hemorrhage during the operation, there are three means vv'hich may be used. The first of these is the tourniquet, contrived by Petit (l7l 6), who, instead of the turn- stick, as it was called, and which had been previously employed, used a screw and couple of plates, which, being separated by turning the handle, effected the pressure more gradually, and so as to dispense with-the services of the assistant who was em- ployed to hold the turn-stick. This screw tourniquet, variously modified and improved, is the instrument still generally used for the purpose. The second method is compression of the aorta by a clamp sun-ounding the body, wMch has been found very useful in amputating at the hip joint. The third mode of commanding "the vessels, is by simply compressing them with the hands. In certain amputations this is the only means that can be used, owing to the proximity of the operation to the trimk ; and some surgeons, from the facility and dispatch attending it never employ a tourniquet on any occasion. In cases where the tourniquet can be applied without doing harm, it ought to be preferred, as it relieves the assistant from a fatiguing duty, and prevents the patient from losing so much blood as he is apt to do when the vessels are subjected to manual pressure, if many of them require to be tied. The arteries ought to be pulled out with the catch forceps, and tied quite detached from their neighbouring con- nections. After the principal vessels are secured, the tourniquetPKTNCIPLES OF SURGERY. 160 ought to be entirely removed, to prevent its slackened band from exerting such pressure on the veins as may cause them to bleed, and induce the surgeon to tie them instead of arteries. The earlier modes of amputation rendered union by the first intention impracticable ; and when the operation had been so far improved as to retain the soft paits sufficiently long to meet over the bone, the old system of dressing still continued in use, and the cavity of the stimip was stuffed with lint, as all wounds were in those days healed by the gi-anulating process. Mr. Alanson had the merit of exploding this practice, and introducing light superficial dressings in its stead, which gi-eatly shortened the cure; and though surgeons on the Continent still interpose dressings between the edges of the stump, union by the first intention is always sought for in this coimtry. Stiches, if necessary, ought to be employed to keep the lips of the woimd nearly in theii- proper position; and when the bleeding has ceased, strij)s of adhesive plaster may be used to retain them in accurate contact. The bad consequ.ences of the operation are chiefly hemoiThage, sero-purulent effusion into other parts of the body, especially the cavity of the thorax, suppuration of the stump, and exfoliation of the bone. Hemorrhage may appear immediately after the operation, either from arteries which have not been tied, o^ving to their not shewing themselves by bleeding during the state of collapse suc- ceeding the removal of a limb, or from the veins being com- pressed by too tight a bandage. In the former case, it is necessary to apply such additional ligatures as may be reqtiisite ; in the latter, it is sufficient to slacken the bandage. Hemorrhage sometimes commences a few hours after the stump is dressed ; and then depends either upon a general oozing from the cut sur- face, consequent upon the reaction of the system, or upon some imperfection in the ligature of the vessels, which allows the blood to escape when impelled with more force than it was while the patient remained weak and faint. Cold lotions and pressure will restrain it, if proceeding from the first of these soui'ces ; but additional ligatures will be required, if, resisting such means, it161 AMPUTATION. proves to be from the second of them. The hemorrhage occa- sionally does not occur imtil the third, foiu'th, or even seventh day; and then almost always depends upon ulceration of the artery. In this case, a ligature should be applied to the orifice of the vessel, if the bleeding cannot be arrested by pressure effected through means of compresses introduced into the stump, and a tight bandage applied externally. When the stump does not unite, but inflames and suppurates, fomentations ought to be frequently applied until the discharge is fully established, when stimulating washes and pressure must be employed to support the weakened action of the granulating surfaces, and make them unite together. Purulent effusions into internal cavities occur chiefly in weak, debilitated, irritable subjects, and have been accounted for variously. They are known to result in such habits from excited action, whatever be the cause producing it. Inflamma- tion of the veins and blood-poisoning have also been supposed to be the cause of their occurrence. There are no means of remedy- ing such effusions, and the only way of avoiding them is, so far as possible, to avoid operating in circumstances which predispose to their occurrence. Exfohation of the bone is very troublesome, not only from delaying the process of cure, but by tending to render it imperfect through retraction of the soft parts composing the stump, which gradually takes place in the event of their not uniting over the extremity of the bone. It sometimes depends upon the injured or diseased state of the limb—and may also be occasioned by too free removal of the periosteum, or deficiency in the covering left for the bone. The most common form is merely a ring from the circumference of the bone, with irregular spicular prolongations upwards. But occasionally the exfolia- tion is much more extensive, and extends in a conical form up the interior of the bone. Particular Amputations. The fingers may be amputated with most advantage at the joints. There used to be a prejudice against leaving an articular MPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 162 surface, the cartilage of wliicli was thought to exfoliate necessarily so as to render the cure more tedious and troublesome. Disarti- culation was therefore avoided as much as possible, and when, from any circumstance, it appeared necessary, the precaution was taken of scraping off the cartilage. It is now well ascertained that union by the first intention generally occurs as readily after disarticulation as after amputation through the shafts of bones, and that when it does not take place, the only inconvenience ex- perienced from the cartilage is a little increase and longer con- tinuance of the discharge. Such being the case, though it would be wrong to amputate through a joint by preference, still, when there is any lasting advantage to be gained by doing so, the chance of bad consequences, so trivial, ought not to be regarded as a sufficient objection to it. "When the distal phalanx alone of a finger ds affected, it ought to be removed by cutting into the joint on the dorsal surface, dividing the lateral ligaments, and then carrying the knife for- wards parallel with the palmar surface of the bone so as to save a flap to cover the stump : or the operation may be reversed by transfixing the finger, while its palmar surface is turned upAvards, forming the flap, and then cutting through the joint. "VNTien the finger requires to be amputated above this joint, the operation should be performed by making two semilunar incisions, one on each side, or above and below, so as to form two flaps, which being dissected back will expose the bone, and allow it to be divided by the cutting-pUers. The flaps are then made to meet together over the face of the stump. The second phalanx might be removed at the joint in the same way as the first; but as the portion of finger thus left would be neither useful nor seemly, it is better, unless the patient refuses his consent, to take away the whole of it at its metacarpal articulation. In doing this, while the other fingers are held aside, the surgeon should place the point of his knife exactly over the summit of the joint, and cut first on one side and then on the other, obliquely into the palm of the hand to the point opposite that from which he set out, taking care to keep exactly in the angle formed by tlie integu-AMPUTATION. 163 ments connecting the fingers. The flaps being detached, he may readily pass the point of his knife round the head of the bone. Lisfranc made one flap first, then carried his knife through the joint, and completed the operation by cutting outwards. When the parts retain their natural laxity, this proceeding is equally easy and expeditious ; but if they are thickened and indurated, as is generally the case, the second flap is very apt to be injured in detaching the head of the bone ; and even in the most favour- able circumstances it is much more difficult to adapt the flaps properly to each other in this way, than in the one just described. One or two stitches are often useful in keeping the edges of the skin in contact. Of all the operations for ampu.tating fingers this is the most important, from the frequency of cases requiring its application. The distal phalanx, indeed, almost never stands in need of removal by itself, since nearly all the morbid conditions to which it is subject from injury or disease admit of reparation ; and it is of course always advisable to retain the extremity of the finger with its protecting nail, even though the bone, in whole or . part, may be taken away ; and when more than the distal phalanx must be removed, it is almost always better, in respect to appearance as well as use, to amputate the whole finger. When • the fore or little finger requires removal, the articulating extremity of the metacarpal bone should be taken off for the sake of appearance. "V\naen a portion of the metacarpal bone requires to be removed, •the best method is to apply the point of the knife at the part where the bone requires to be divided, and cut down on each side of it, in the angle formed by the integuments between the fingers, so as to make the incisions meet below, opposite the metacarpo- digital articulation; and then divide the bone by means of the cutting-pKers, which were introduced into surgery by Mr. Listen at an early period of his practice,—and from their extensive utility may be regarded as the most valuable addition that has been made to the modern armoury of the profession. When the metacarpal bone of the thumb is the one concerned, a portion of it may be removed by making two incisions, commencing wherePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 164 the bone requires to be divided, inclosing the thumb, and meet- ing together at the angle of union between it and the fore-finger. If it is necessary, the whole bone may be easily disarticulated through similar incisions. The same processes are proper for re- moving the metacarpal bone of the little-finger in part or in whole. The toes ought to be amputated on the same principles ; but, with the exception of the great one, which may be removed through the joint of the first and second phalanx, it is always proper in removing them to perform disarticulation between the first phalanx and metatarsal bone, since the small portion that might be allowed to remain could be of no use, and in all pro- bability would occasion lameness. When more of the great toe than the distal phalanx requires removal, the operation shoidd be performed through the metatarsal bone, in order to prevent its large articulating extremity from impeding recovery, and render- ing the foot unseemly as well as inconvenient. The disease requuing amputation sometimes extends to the tarsus, but is limited to the bones on one side of the foot— namely, the internal cuneiform and navicular on the tibial, and the cuboid on the fibular side. In this case, instead of ampu- tating the foot, it is better to make a free removal of the diseased parts by taking them away, together with the metatarsal bones articulated to them. The operation should be conducted on the same plan as for the removal of a metatarsal bone by itself, and wiU be found hardly more difficult or serious. Partial ampu- tation of the foot may also be performed transversely through the metatarsus, between the metatarsus and tarsus, and through the tarsus. The first and second of these methods are very seldom admissible, owing to the disease which requires removal of a part of the foot, generally extending so far as to encroach upon the bones where they would need to be divided; and they are also objectionable from the difficulty which attends their execution, while there is no counter-balancing advantage in their favour, since, when once the anterior extremity of the longitudinal arch of the foot is taken away, no additional inconvenience results from removing a larger portion, so long as the posterior extremity165 AMPUTATION, or heel is allowed to remain. It has been objected that the extensor muscles of the ankle-joint, having no opponents left attached when amputation is performed through the tarsus, must draw up the heel and point the cicatrix to the ground. But ex- perience has proved that, this unpleasant consequence is consider- ably opposed by the flexor tendons adhering to the cicatrix. The operation through the tarsus, which was invented by Chopart, had been entirely neglected in this country, but came into pretty general use after I performed it (1829). The blade of the knife employed should be about six inches long, and half an inch broad, sharp at the point, and blunt on the back. The tourniquet ought to be applied immediately above the ankle, having compresses placed over the posterior and anterior tibial arteries. The surgeon should measure with his, eye the middle distance between the malleolus exiernus and the/ head of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, which is the situa-" \ tion of the articulation between the os cuboides and os calcis. Placing his fore-finger here, he ought to fix his thumb on the other side of the foot directly opposite, which will shew him where the os naviculare and astragalus are connected. An inci- sion somewhat curved with its convexity forwards is then to be made from one of these points to the other, when, instead of pro- ceeding to disarticulate, the operator should transfix the sole of the foot from side to side at the extremities of the first incision, and carry the knife forwards, so as to detach a sufficient flap, which must extend the whole length of the metatarsus to the balls of the toes. The disarticulation may finally be completed with great ease, as the shape of the articular surfaces concerned is very simple, and nearly transverse. The plantar, anterior tibial, and any other arteries that require to be secured, must then be tied, and the flap having been secured in its place by a few stitches, some light dressing ought to be applied. During the cure the knee ought to be kept bent to relax the gastrocnemius. As disease of an incurable kind frequently affects the joint between the os calcis and the astragalus, and also the ankle-jointPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 16G itseK, beyond the reach of any partial amputation of the foot, some attempts had been made to remove it at the an Vie, by making a flap from the integuments of the instep, but with results so little satisfactory, that amputation of the leg continued to be the established means of remedy in such cases. In 1842, I accomplished the object in a different way, by preserving the tliick integimients of the heel for covering the ends of the bones, and this may now be considered the proper procedure for effect- ing removal of the foot when practicable. When the operation is to be perfonned, pressure should be made on the tibial arteries by the fingers of an assistant, or a tourniquet applied above the anMe. The only instruments required are a knife, of which the blade should not exceed foui inches in length, and a saw. The foot being held at a right angle to the leg, the point of the knife is introduced immediately below the malleolar projection of the fibida, rather nearer its posterior than anterior edge, and then carried across the bone to the inner side of the ankle, where it terminates at the point exactly opposite its commencement. The extremities of the inci- sion thus formed are then joined by another passing in front of the joint. The operator next proceeds to detach the flap from. the bone, and for this purpose, having placed the fingers of his left hand over the prominence of the os calcis, and inserted the point of his thumb between the edges of the plantar incision, guides the Imife between the bone and nail of the thumb, taking great care to cut parallel with the bone, and to avoid scoring or laceration of the integuments. He then opens the joint in front, carries his knife outwards and downwards on each side of the astragalus, so as to divide the lateral ligaments, and thus com- pletes the disarticulation. Lastly, the knife is carried roimd the extremities of the tibia and fibula, so as to afford room for apply- ing the saw, by means of which the articular projections are removed, together with a thin connecting slice of bone covered by cartilage. The vessels being then tied, and the edges of the wound stitched together, a piece of wet lint is applied lightly over the stump, without any bandage, so as to avoid the risk of167 AMPUTATION. undue pressure in the event of the cavity becoming distended with b]ood, which would be apt to occasion sloughing of the flap. When recovery is completed, the stump has a slightly bulbous form, from the thick cushion of dense textures that cover the heel, and readily admits of being fitted with a boot. The advantages which I originally anticipated from this ope- ration were—-j^rs^,. the formation of a more useful support for the body than could be obtained from any form of amputation of the leg; and, secondly, the diminution of risk to the patient's life, from the smaller amount of mutilation, the cutting of arterial branches instead of trunks, the leaving entire the medullary hollow and membrane, and the exposure of cancellated bone, which is not liable to exfoliate like the dense osseous substance of the shaft. From my own experience, and that of many other practitioners who have adopted amputation at the anlde, I now feel warranted to state that these favourable expectations have been fully realised, and that, in addition to its other advantages, this operation may be regarded as almost entirely free from danger to life. It also has the great advantage of removing not only the bone already diseased, but the whole of that spongy portion which may be disposed to suffer in the same way, as not unfrequently happened after the operation of Chopart. Some attempts have been made to improve this operation by varying the form of the flap, and by retainitig the astragalus or tuberosity of the os calcis. But all of these modifications seem to lessen the simplicity, facility, and efficiency of the operation ; more especially the one last mentioned, which was proposed by M. Perigoff of St. Petersburg, appears objectionable, by complicat- ing the process, exposing to the risk of relapse, by retaining a portion of the tarsal bones, and impeding the use of an artificial foot by rendering the limb inconveniently long. The circumstances which were formerly held to require re- moval of the Leg so generally admit of relief through amputation at the ankle, that the former operation is now rarely necessary in practice. Indeed, I have of late years performed it chiefly for the remedy of useless or uncomfortable stumps, resulting from168 PKINCIPLES OF SURGEKY, amputation by flap at the middle or higher part of the leg. There can be no doubt that in these situations the flap method is very- apt to leave a mass of redundant substance, ai^ording no protec- tion to the bone, which, having nothing to cover it except an imperfect cicatrix, is a perpetual source of discomfort and suffer- ing. In order to prevent the risk of such unpleasant occurrences, and also to afford relief from them when they have unfortunately taken place, I think amputation of the leg should always be per- formed on the following principles :— In the first place, it does not seem desirable for any useful purpose to retain a longer stvimp than when the tibia is divided at the distance of an inch below the tuberosity; and as the can- cellated texture of this part is less prone to exfoliation than the dense substance of the shaft, it is therefore improper to operate lower in the limb. Secondly, since a covering of muscle is not essential to the formation of a good stump, as may be seen from the results of amputation at the ankle, and since the attempt to retain a muscular cushion below the Imee is, as has just been mentioned, apt to leave the bone in an exposed state, the opera- tion should be so conducted as to make sure of obtaining a sufficient protection from the integuments. On the whole, I believe, from ample experience, that the following mode of pro- cedure, founded upon these principles, is the most eligible that can be adopted :— A tourniquet having been applied above the knee, two semi- X lunar incisions are to be made through the skin, from side to side of the limb, with their convexities downwards, and their extremi- ties meeting about two inches below the tuberosity of the tibia. The flaps thus formed are then to be detached from their subjacent connections, so as to expose the bones at the distance of an inch below the tuberosity. The muscles are next divided behind about the middle of the extent to which their surface has been exposed, and then on the other side on a level with the line where the saw is to be applied. Allowance having thus been made for the unequal retraction of the anterior and posterior muscles, the surface of flesh and bone presented after the operation is perfectlyAMPUTATION. 169 even, and admits of being covered by the flaps of integument without either straining or redundance. The stump thus formed may either be rested on the knee, or employed so as to retain the use of the joint, by means of an apparatus consisting of a hollow cone secured by straps buckled round the knee. Amputation of the leg may also Jbe^ performed very con- veniently at its lower end, ajittle__way above the ankle, by formiDg two flaps of nearly equal size from the anterior and pos- terior parts of the limb. The result of this operation is a stump certainly not equal to that obtained at the ankle-joint, but still very suitable for the adaptation of an artificial foot. Amputation of the tliigh has afforded by far the most keenly contested field for conflicting opinions in regard to the best mode of operating. Until about forty years ago, the operation by cir- cular incision, or cutting the integuments so as to provide a covering for the bone, was invariably practised by British surgeons both at home and abroad. But the flap method— which, though taught, and, at a former period, to some extent practised, on the Continent, had not been applied to the thigh in this coimtry—was strongly advocated by the late Mr. Listen, and also by myseK, as may be seen from our papers in the Edin- burgh Medical Jovirnal of that period, and came into general use. Indeed, before the introduction of anaesthetic means, the facility and rapidity of this operation, by greatly lessening the patient's sufferings, gave it a great advantage over the other .process ; and it was also supposed that a muscular covering for the bone would prove of great service. While, however, the former of these considerations has ceased to be of any conse- quence, the latter was contradicted by experience, since it appeared that the muscles were liable to such retraction as not only prevented their union over the bone, but withdrew the integuments so as to prevent them from doing so. Various attempts were made to obviate these bad effects, by modifyiug the length and direction of the flaps, by making them anterior and posterior instead of lateral, and by varying their relative proportions, with little success, until Mr. Teale, by making a170 PllINCIPLES OF SURGERY. very loug anterior flap, has relieved the operation from its great defect. In operating at the lower third of the thigh, when a suffi- ciently long anterior flap cannot be obtained for the purpose, I think the circular method should be preferred, and have loug employed it with the most satisfactory results, by making two semilunar incisions from side to side, close above the patella, reflecting the skin, dividing the muscles as high as they are exposed in front, and a little lower behind, to -allow for the dif- ference in their retraction ; and lastly, drawing them upwards, so as to let the saw be applied two inches higher than the mus- cular incision in front. The tliigh may be amputated at the hip-joint; but in this case the shock inflicted on the system is so great, and the wound which remains to be healed is so extensive, that the operation ought never to be performed unless the patient's situation affords him no other chance of escape from certain death. There are various modes of operating, the choice of which must be regulated by the circumstances of the case, but in general the following one will be found the most eligible, in respect both to the ease of its performance and to its result:— An assistant should grasp the limb as liigh as possible, press- ing with liis thumbs upon the artery in the groin, where it lies on the brim of the pelvis, and with his fingers upon the hip. The surgeon introduces the point of a narrow knife about ten inches long, nearly half way between the spinous process of the ileum and trochanter major, thrusts it through transversely before the bone, so as to form an anterior flap, which, being held up by an assistant, he makes another from the posterior parts, then desires the limb to be abducted, opens the joint^, and completes the disarticulation. The fore-arm ought to be amputated by making two equal flaps, from before and behind; the arm being held while tliis is done injhejniddle state of supination and pronation, in order to relax the muscles equally, and thus facilitate the operation. The hand may be removed at the wrist-joint by transfixing the limb171 AMPUTATION. laterally and forming a flap from the palmar aspect; but the longer stump thus obtained is not found to facilitate the adapta-^ tion, or increase the utility, of an artificial hand; and the large articular surface which remains, though it may not materially delay the cure, must always cause deformity. The arm may be amputated above the elbow, either by double flap or circular incision ; but the former mode is greatly preferable. A tourniquet is here quite unnecessary, as the vessel can be compressed easily and effectually by the hand placed over it at the inner edge of the biceps. Amputation at the shoulder-joint is not unfrequently re- quired, and may be performed in various ways, with three of which the surgeon should be familiar, as the state of the parts concerned sometimes leaves no room for choice. 1. The circulation through the subclavian artery being arrested by pressure with the thumb above the clavicle, where the vessel issues from between the scaleni, and rests on the first rib, the surgeon thrusts a sharp-pointed knife down to the head of the humerus, immediately below the acromion process ; and cutting downwards in a semilunar direction, first on one side, and then on the other, so that the two incisions meet in the axilla, he forms two lateral flaps, which, being dissected back, expose the joint, and enable him to effect the disarticulation very readily, by pushing his knife through the capsular ligament, and then cutting roimd the glenoid cavity. 2. The surgeon introduces the point of a long narrow knife a little nearer the clavicle than the middle space between the acro- mion and coracoid processes, thrusts it downwards and back- wards untn it issues at the inferior margin of the axilla, and then cuts in the same direction, so as to form a large external flap. Having, in doing this, cut through part of the capsular ligament, he has no difficulty in passing the knife round the head of the humerus, and making a suitable flap from the re- maining parts, the assistant introducing his finger as soon as sufficient room is afforded for the purpose, and compressing the vessel. If the left arm is the subject of operation, the knife may172 PRINCirLES OF SURGERY. be introduced at tlie lower margin of the axilla, and brought out at the point where it is entered in the former way. 3. The surgeon cuts in a semilunar direction from one side of the deltoid to the other, so as to form a large flap of this muscle, which, being dissected from its subjacent connections, and held up, exposes the joint, allows the disarticulation to be completed, and permits the fingers of the assistant to be introduced to com- ■press the vessels before they are divided, together with the re- maining muscles and integuments, by a transverse incision. After aU of these operations, of which the one first mentioned should be preferred when circumstances permit its performance, which is generally the case, the arteries ought to be tied, the edges of the flaps stitched together, and a proper bandage applied. The Scapula is liable to the formation of morbid growths, which have on various occasions led to partial, but never to its entire removal, until I performed tlds operation six years ago. It might be expected that the arm concerned, in the event of being preserved, must remain a mere useless appendage; but on the contrary, experience has shown that its strength and mobility are sufficient for all ordinary purposes. There is now dis- charging the duties of a provincial letter-carrier, one of my patients who can lift heavy weights, and has the perfect use of his arm from the elbow downwards. Indeed, there is not only complete mobility, but also a considerable power of motion at the shoulder from the trapezius, and other muscles—which were attached to the scapula—acting through adhesion to the soft textures lying between them and the humerus. The scapula may be removed either alone or together with the arm. In the former case, two incisions should be made in this form f, one extending from the clavicle, a little nearer the sternum than its connections with the arenoid process ; and the other, being transverse in its direction from the acromion to the posterior edge of the tumour. The flaps thus formed having been dissected from the subjacent surface, the clavicle is divided at the part where it is exposed, and held outwards by an assistant, while the operator cuts through the articular textures, andAMPUTATION. 173 separates the muscular attachments, while another assistant compresses the axUlary plexus, with his hand introduced through the wound. The vessels are then tied, the cut edges stitched to- gether, and the arm supported by a sling. Wlien the arm also requires to be removed, the process is stUl more simple. Two semilunar incisions should extend from the acromion process downwards, on each side of the shoulder, to the inferior angle of the scapula ; the operation in other respects being conducted as in the former case.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 174 CHAPTEE XT. BONES. Fractures. The osseous tissue resembles, in general, tlae other vascular parts of the system as to ,the healthy and morbid actions of its nutritious system, but is remarkably distinguished by its power of reproduction. It is not possible to explain on what this difference depends, but its existence is of great consequence in remedying the accidents to which bones are most exposed by their rigidity—viz., Fracture. Bones may be fractured in three ways—1. By external violence operating directly upon the injured part; 2. By external violence causing a strain upon the bone so as to break it, not where the force is applied, but at some other part of its extent; 3. By inordinate action of the muscles. Fractures result, most frequently from the first and second of these causes, and very rarely from the third. They occur at all periods of life, but are more frequently met with in particular bones at one age than another. In children, the thigh bone, humerus, and clavicle ; in adults, the bones of the leg and fore-arm, the shaft^of the femur, the humeinis, clavicle, and ribs ; and in old people, the neck of the femur, are the bones most liable to be broken. Independently of diseased conditions to be mentioned afterwards, which render the bones more subject to fracture, it would appear that the bones of some individuals are more easily broken than those of others. Fractures may be transverse or oblique in respect to the axis of the bone—they may be single or comminuted—and they may be attended with a wound exposing the bone, or without one, whence they are divided into Compound and Simple. In ex-175 BONES. plaining the symptoms and treatment of fracture, it is necessary to consider separately the two departments of this last division, wliich is of great importance. Simple Fractures. The symptoms of simple fracture are—1. Distortion or change of shape, owing to the broken bone being unable to counteract the displacing tendency of the surrounding muscles and the weight of the limb itself; whence are caused shortening or retraction, the extent of which depends upon the obliquity of the fracture, and rotation, 2. Diminution or total loss of volun- tary motion. 3. Preternatural mobility by external forces. 4. Swelling from the effusion of blood by ruptured vessels, and from the same source the discoloration of ecchymosis appearing some time after the accident. 5. Pain and spasmodic starting of the muscles, owing to the irritation of the sharp extremities of the bone. 6. Crepitus, or a grating sensation when the limb is j > moved, from the rough osseous surfaces rubbing against each other. When the extremities of a broken bone are allowed to remain at rest they unite, together, and if examined by a section after- wards, exhibit a mass of new osseous matter, which serves as their bond of union. The old surgeons believed that this callus, as it was called, residted from an effusion poured out by the surroimding soft parts, in consequence of the irritation of the in- jury, which concreted about the broken bones, and united them together. The great object of treatment, according to this view, was by local pressure, to restrain the effusion from going beyond due bounds. For this purpose short splints, or pieces of wood, pasteboard, or iron, were tightly bandaged to the limb over the injured part. Mr. Pott had the merit of exposing to the surgeons of this country the impropriety of such a practice, and introduc- ing another more scientific as well as practically useful. Mr. Pott attributed exuberance of the callus to imperfect adjustment of the broken bones, which causing irregularity and projection of their extremities, consequently rendered their unionPRINCIPLES OP SURGERY. 176 large and clumsy. He therefore insisted upon carefully setting or replacing the fracture, and in doing this pointed out the im- portance of relaxing, by proper position of the limb, those muscles which by their contraction caused or increased the dis- tortion. Here he remarked very justly, that what is usually called the riding or rising end of the bone, from its seeming to project, is, with some few exceptions, really in its place, and appears prominent merely because the other is drawn in an oppo- site direction by the muscles. He shewed the folly as well as danger of attempting to squeeze down the projection by local pressure, and discarded the short splints which were employed for this purpose. But in order to retain the proper position after obtaining it by due relaxation of the muscles, and prevent the weight of the limb, the movements of the patient, and the spasms of the irritated muscles from causing displacement, he recom- mended the use of splints long enough to extend beyond the joints at both extremities of the broken bone. The process by which reunion is accomplished can seldom be inspected before its completion, and experiments on the lower animals are not to be regarded as affording unexceptionable evidence; it has therefore been very variously explained, and still remains in some points rather obscure. The following steps seem to be well ascertained. In the first place, the parts which form the cavity that encloses the fractured extremities of the bone become thickened and consolidated by the interstitial effusion and organization of lymph. The medullary membrane undergoes a somewhat similar change, while the, surface of the bone acquires a covering of gelatinous-looking Ijmiph. The sort of capsule which is thus formed by the indurated periosteum, muscles, fat, or whatever other tissue happens to be concerned, gradually becomes firmer, and has ossific matter deposited in its substance, generally in largest masses where the periosteum stni adheres to the bone. The broken extremities are thus by degrees joined together and rendered immovable, but still remain imable to resist any considerable force which tends to separate them. The process of ossification then proceeds inwards from aU the177 BONES. surface, both of the old bone and of that newly formed. A fibro- cartilaginous sort of mass fills the cavity that exists while this is going on, and when the cure is completed, the bone, if divided, exposes a compact osseous mass, which in the course of time acquu-es a cancellated texture, but has not the medullary canal perfectly restored. The time required for this process varies with the size of the bone, being performed most quickly when it is smallest, and vice versa. The shaft of one of the large bones, such as the femur or tibia, generally acquires rigidity in the course of four or five weeks, but does not regain suflEicient strength for supporting the body or performing locomotion until several weeks afterwards ; and, so far as can be judged from the opportunities of observa- tion occasionally afforded, is not completely ossified - at the fractured part before the lapse of several months. The age, con- stitiition, and peculiar circumstances of the patient also cause variations in the process of cure. It is most speedy in youth and health. In pregnancy it is alleged to be performed in general with less energy than usual. Eest of the limb promotes it, and motion not only retards, but if considerable or long-con- tinued, altogether prevents it; in which case the substance that ought to have formed the new bone acquires the appearance and properties of ligament, so as to render the limb flexible, and con- stitute what is called an artificial joint, the different kinds and ti'eatment of which will be more particularly considered after- wards. In treating fractures, it is of great consequence to set or replace the extremities of the bone as soon as possible after the injury is sustained, in order to prevent the bad effects of their continued imtation, to effect the adjustment before it is impeded by swelling of the limb or thickening of the parts which surround the bones, and to avoid disturbing the process of reunion by altering the position of the broken surfaces at a later period. When swelling and tension are actually present, it is sometimes thought proper to delay the adjustment until these symptoms are subdued by leeches and fomentations ; but as such means can NrHINCIPLES OF SURGEUy. 178 have little effect "while the cause of irritation continues in operation, it is always better to reduce the bones into their proper situation as soon as possible, and then keep the limb steady by means of splints. The best material for splints is thick pasteboard, or thin wood split longitudinally into narrow portions, and covered with leather. They should be long enough to extend beyond both ends of the fractured bones, and broad enough to equal the diameter of the limb. Those of the former kind must be well softened by immersion in hot water, or being thoroughly moistened with it, and then padded with carded tow, lint, or flannel. There are usually required two splints, one for each side of the limb, and the best bandages for retaining them are the loQpgdJbandage, the tailed^^i^ijdage, and the cony^on (^djer. The first of these consists of narrow strips of calico, about an inch and a half broad, and long enough when folded double to pass round the limb with a few inches of excess ; one of the ends is then drawn through the loop and tied to the other. The number of pieces thus applied varies with the length of the limb, as there ought not to be more than three inches between them. This bandage is useful when the degree of tightness requires to be occasionally altered, and the Hmb cannot be moved without disadvantage. The tailed bandage consists of a common roller, divided into pieces long enough to encircle the limb somewhat obliquely, and cross over far enough to keep their hold. Sixj eight, ten, or whatever number of these the length of the limb requires, are placed transversely under it, so that each overlaps the one above it about two-thirds. The lowest one is then drawn tightly round the Kmb, and while its ends are stiU held by the surgeon or his assistant, the one next above is applied in the same manner, so as to secure the former, and so on until the whole are thus disposed of. This bandage effects a very equable pressure, and can be changed without disturbing the limb ; but it does not admit of partial relaxation or tightening. The common roller is the simplest and easiest of all the means for the purpose, but can be only used where the limb may be moved without any inconvenience. There are various contrivances for assisting the179 BONES, splints and bandages in preserving the proper position ; but they will be best explained along with the particular circumstances requiring them. Another method of treating fractures has of late years been introduced, though there seems great reason to question its superiority over that previously in use. It consists in closely enveloping the injured limb with pasteboard and bandages, covered with starch. Some practitioners apply this immovable apparatus, as it has been called, immediately after the receipt of the injury, but others wait a few days until the tension and engorgement of the limb subside. The great advantage contended for is the abridgment of confinement, since the patient, so soon as the bandages become dry and firm, may quit his bed without danger of displacing the broken surfaces. On the other hand, it may be stated, that the process of dressing is not only tedious and requiring great nicety in its execution, but, unless he be carefully watched, must expose the patient to the risk of various bad consequences, from alterations, in the size of the limb occur- ring subsequently to its adjustment. On the latter account, especially, this mode of treatment seems most suitabre in hospital practice; and here, again, as the patients have no object but a speedy recovery, there does not appear to be any benefit derived from treating them propped up in chairs, or moving about on crutches, instead of being allowed to lie quietly in their beds. Compound Fractures. The wound wliich constitutes the distinguishing character of compound fractures occasions a most important difference in respect to the danger and difficulty of cure attending them. There is apt to proceed from this source violent inflammation with fever, terminating in profuse suppuration or gangrene, or death without any remarkable local change, merely from the effects of constitutional disturbance. These consequences used to be ascribed to the admission of air, but are now referred with more reason to the inflammation of an extensive wound impli- cating important and irritable tissues ; for unless the orifice of the cavity heals by the first intention, its surface must necessarilyPIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. 180 inflame as tlie first step to granulation. The great object in treating such injuries is consequently to obtain immediate union, and thus convert them into simple fractures. If the bone projects through the wound, a portion ought to be removed from its extremity by the saw or pliers, sufficient for allowing it to be easily replaced. To prevent irritation, which is so adverse to adhesion, the bones ought to be carefully set as soon as possible; and to keep down inflammatory action, cloths wet with cold water should be assiduously applied, until there is no longer any fear of it, or until it actually commences. With the same view, the patient must be confined to the most strict antiphlogistic regimen ; and if inflammation comes on, fomenta- tions and poultices should be substituted for the cold applications. Bleeding is to be used with great caution, since the patient, if he survives the immediate danger, will have to support a copious and profuse suppuration ; and those means which subdue violent action without permanently weakening the system ought to be preferred. So soon as the inflammatory tension begins to sub- side, the relaxing applications must be changed for those of a stimulating and astringent kind. The lotions of acetate of lead, sulphate of zinc, etc., are the best adapted for this purpose. Counter-openings, if required, should be made to afford the matter free vent, and pressure must be carefully effected by com- presses and bandages, while the most unceasing attention is bestowed on the preservation of proper position and perfect rest. The patient's strength requires of course to be supported by nourishing food. Pieces of bone occasionally become detached during the cure, and delay or prevent it; they ought therefore to be diligently searched for and extracted. When the injuiy is so severe as to preclude the possibility of ■recovery, amputation must be performed. The circumstances to be taken into account in determining on this proceeding are— 1. The state of the soft parts ; 2. That of the blood-vessels and nerves ; 3. That of the bones ; 4. That of the patient's constitu- tion ; 5. That of the means for proper treatment. It is possible that any one of these circumstances may be so unfavourable asBONES. 181 to render the measure in question necessary, but it more frer quently happens that the surgeon is influenced by several or all of them in deciding on the operation. It will, of course, always be desirable to save the limb, but even when the circum- stances of the injury seem favourable for attempting this, if there is a want of proper attendance or other requisites for suc- cess, amputation should be decidedly preferred to endangering the patient's life. Partimlar Fractures. Hands and Feet.—The phalanges of the fingers and toes, o\ving to their shortness and mobility, are little subject to fracture. The injury, when it does occur, is readily recognised, and easily treated by means of a narrow wooden splint, padded with lint, and supported by a roller. In treating fracture of the proximal phalanx of the fingers, it is difficult to keep the bone straight in the extended position, owing to the efiiect of the flexors in drawing the broken ends downwards, and it will be found more convenient to fill the hollow of the hand with tow or some other soft material, and then bind down the fingers upon it. The metacarpal and metatarsal bones are more frequently broken, when there is little displacement, but considerable swelling, pain, and crepitus, with preternatural mobility of the corresponding finger or toe. A compress of tow, supported by a roller, pre- vents motion of the fractured extremities, which is all that the case requires. Bones of the Leg.—The fibula is apt to be fractured by twists of the foot outwards, and usually gives way from about an inch to an- inch and a half above its inferior extremity. The eversjon of the foot, and its mobility in a lateral direction, with the pain and crepitus caused by the broken surfaces, render the injury very distinct. The best mode of treatment is that devised by M. Dupuytren. It consists in placing on the inner side of the leg a thick cushion, to which, after having been secured in its place by means of a roller, a wooden splint, long enough to extend beyond both the foot and the knee, is fastened ; and thenPEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 182 applying a baudage at each extremity of the sphnt, so as to draw the foot and upper end of the tibia towards it, and thus effectu- ally counteracting the distortion which is caused by the weight of the limb, and the action of the peroneal muscles. Sometimes along with this fracture the foot is found displaced not to the side but backwards, in which case the heel is remarkably elon- gated and the instep shortened. After the parts have been adjusted by suitable extension and pressure the same apparatus is to be used, with this difference, that the cushion and splint are placed in front. Dupuytren directed them to be placed be- hind, but I have not been able to attain the object desired in this way. The lower end of the splint should have the form of a horse-shoe, so as to embrace the instep. When the fibula is fractured higher up, the cause is generally direct violence, and the symptoms are so obscure, that, unless the examination be instituted early, before swelling comes on, it is difficult to decide whether the bone is broken or not. The treatment requires ; merely a roller applied from the toes upwards, to prevent motion. The tibia is occasionally fractured, while the fibula remains entire, generally in consequence of falling from a height on the : heel, and gives way most frequently a few inches from the lower end. There is usually not much displacement, but great pain, and complete loss of power over the leg. The treatment is easily conducted, since it requires merely the use of means for prevent- ing motion ; and a couple of pasteboard or leather splints, secured by the looped bandage, so that they may be relaxed or tightened according to the degree of swelling, will be found sufficient for the purpose, the limb being laid on its outer side, with the knee bent. The tibia and fibula are very often broken together. The fracture is generally oblique, and seated about the middle, or towards the lower third of the limb. The two bones seldom give ' way opposite to each other, and frequently do so at the distance of several inches. The accident sometimes results from direct violence, but more usually is caused by strains on the shafts of the bones, from twists or falls. There being in this case no longerBONES. 183 any resistance to the distorting tendency of the weight of the limb and the retraction of its muscles, there is always much eversion of the foot and bending of the leg, the upper extremity of the tibia pressing upon the skin, or projecting through it owing to the lower one being pulled upwards and backwards by the gastrocnemii muscles. Various methods are followed in treating this common and important fracture. It is evident that the extended position is objectionable, from not affording any relaxation to the muscles which produce the distortion, and that, therefore, the knee ought, if possible, to be bent. This may be done either by simply laying the limb on its outer side, properly supported with splints, or by placing it on a double inclined plane. It will be found that, owing to peculiarities in the seat and direction of the fracture, the extremities are retained in apposition more easily, sometimes by one of these modes, sometimes by the other. When the fracture occurs very near the knee, the upper fragment becomes subject to the action of the extensors of the knee, and the straight position, consequently, is required to keep the broken surfaces in contact. The patella is occasionally fractured, both by the direct effect of external violence, and also, as it appears, by inordinate con- traction of the muscles attached to it. In the former case, which is more rare than the other, the fracture is generally commiauted, and sometimes longitudinal. In the latter, it is always transverse, and allows the two portions to be widely separated, so that the condyles of the femur can be felt between them. The nature of the injury is consequently very obvious, and is stiU further indicated by the complete loss of power over the joint which attends it. When the fracture is longitudinal or comminuted, it is distinguished by pain, mobility of the fragments, and crepitus. Eeunion of the transverse fracture is opposed by the following circumstances:—1. The difiiculty of approximating the broken surfaces, and keeping them steady. 2. The presence of the fluid of the joint, which is secreted in increased quantity, owing to tlie irritation of the injury. 3. The want of vascular parts to assisiPRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. 184 in forming the new bone. Osseous union consequently seldom, or almost never, takes place ; and there is formed merely a sort of ligamentous connection, varying from a few lines to several inches in extent. The treatment ought always to be conducted, however, as if a complete cure were practicable, so that the flexible medium of connection may be rendered as short as possible. With this view, the limb ought to be laid out not only straight, but also somewhat elevated by a pillow, to relax the pelvic extremity of the rectus muscle. A wooden spHut having been placed imder the knee, a single circular turn of a roller should be applied above, and another below, the portions of the bone, the broken surfaces of which may then be di-awn very nearly into contact by tying two longitudinal bands introduced under the circular ones, alongside of the pateUa. A more effectual apparatus consists of two pieces of leather, three or four inches broad, and long enough to surround the limb above and below the patella ; they are provided with straps and buckles for rendering them tight and drawing them together, and then- respective edges are cut out in front to receive the bone. Some discutient lotion to promote absorption of the effused fluid may be employed if necessary. Wlien the fracture is longitudinal, little or no displacement occurs; and all the treatment required consists of lateral com- presses with a bandage. In this fracture the imion is osseous, because most of the adverse circumstances which operate against bony union in the former case are absent. The thigh-bone, notwithstanding its great strength, is very frequently broken, sometimes by direct violence, but more commonly by the strain which happens in falling, particularly on the side. In adults, it usually gives way at the lower third ; in children, at or above the middle; and in old people, at the neck or trochanters. When the shaft is broken, the symptoms are those generally characteristic of fracture, and, in particular, more or less shortening of the thigh, according to the degree of obliquity of the surfaces of the bones, the lower extremity being almost always drawn up beliind the superior one, together with186 BONES. rotation of the foot outwards, owing to the weight of the limb. The only cases in wliich I have found the lower end anterior to the upper one, happened from direct violence. As the thigh is covered before as well as behind with muscles, which extend beyond both the joints at its extremities, and are nearly equal in strength, it is obvious that no position can have the effect, as in the leg, of relaxing them on one side without stretching them on the other. Various mechanical contrivances, therefore, have been invented for permanently extending the limb, of which the long splint of Desault far surpasses all the others in simplicity and efi&ciency. It is merely a board about four inches in breadth, long enough to extend from the 'false ribs a few inches beyond the sole of the foot, and having at each end two holes for the attachment of bandages. The patient's bed having been prepared, by being rendered smooth and fii'm, his hmb is extended imtil it corresponds in length and direction with the sound one ; then a pasteboard splint, properly softened and padded, is applied on the inner side of the thigh, extending from the perineum to beyond the knee, and another on the outer side, reaching from the trochanter major as far down as the former. These splints being secured by four or five looped bandages, the board, wrapped in a sheet or tablecloth, of which enough should be left to sur- roimd the thigh, is placed alongside the limb, and a handker- chief passed under the perineum is tied to its upper end, wliile the foot is secured to the lower one. The imfolded part of the ' .wrapper which lies under the limb is then brought over, and fastened to the splint, a handkerchief at the same time being tied round the patient's body to prevent any lateral displacement of the apparatus. I have long been satisfied that the long splint proves useful not by effecting extension, but simply by preventmg motion hi all the joints of the limb. For it is well known that perfect quiet . can be obtained only in this way, and also that putting a muscle on the stretch would be the most certain means of exciting its contractile tendency. If the fractured surfaces are placed in proper position, and supported by lateral splints, nothing more186 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. will be required but the prevention of movement, while the strongest extending force will prove inadequate to coiTect any defect of the original adjustment. The plan of treatment recommended by Mr. Pott, which was to lay the limb on its outer side with the knee bent, and merely apply two pasteboard splints to prevent the ends of the bones from moving, is very objectionable. It does not afford sufficient rest, and renders a permanent eversion of the limb almost unavoid- able, from the patient turning on his back during the cure, and thus causing the bones to unite in such a manner as to produce this effect. The double inclined plane, of various forms and materials, is much used, and has the sanction of high authority. It is alleged to relax the muscles by a bent position of the joints, without occasioning the inconvenience last mentioned, and also to effect extension by the weight of the body, which is, as it were, suspended from the injured thigh. But, as has been already observed, the muscles are equally tense when the joints of both the knee and hip are bent, as when they are extended; and extension could hardly be obtained by suspending the body from the knee, without causing injurious and insufferable pressure on the popUteal vessels. The upper portion of the bone, too, must be influenced by every motion of the patient's body, and accor- dingly the worst cases of retracted and un-united femur are met with in persons treated by means of the inclined plane, by sm- geons whose known reputation precludes the objection that the machine might have been carelessly or unskilfully employed. Even granting that its efficiency were equal to that of the long splint, the simplicity and facUity of procui'ing the latter apparatus would render it preferable. Particular circumstances, however, occasionally occur, which render the inclined plane preferable, such as the existence of a wound, or rigidity of the knee-joint from previous disease, or peculiarities in the direction of the broken surfaces, and therefore every surgeon ought to be provided with it. The thigh-bone is occasionally fractured through one or other of the condyles into the knee joint, in which case the best treat- ment consists in placing the linib straight, in order that theBONES. 187 tead of the tibia may by its pressure assist in keeping the condyles even, and applying lateral compresses with a bandage. The tliigh-bone is much more frequently fractured through the trochanters and neck, iu consequence, generally, of falls on the side. In persons beyond the age of sixty, the neck is broken by a slight degree of force, and may give way alone ; but it often happens also that the trochanters are split, while the neck remains entire, and is driven into the thick mass of bone at its root like a wedge. The symptoms of fracture in both of these situations are pretty much the same; the limb is shortened from one to two inches, the toes are everted by the weight of the limb, and by the action of the muscles which perform rotation outwards, as their attachments to the troclianter major remain, while the usual resistance to their operation is removed by the fracture. When rotation is performed, the trochanter major may be felt moving as if on its own axis, instead of describing the arc of a circle, as it does when the neck is entire ; the shortening of the | limb readily yields to moderate extension, and returns when it is / discontinued, during which movements an obscure crepitus is generally perceived. It would appear from some cases that if the fracture splits the trochanters, so as to detach the smaller one from the shaft, and also the posterior part of the greater, to which the muscles that perform rotation outwards are attached, leaving the anterior portion of the process which receives the insertion of the glutoius ■ ynedius connected with the body of the bone, the eversion of the limb is prevented, and the toes are turned inwards, but in other respects the symptoms are the same. The discrimination between fracture of the neck alone, and that extending through the trochanters, is not easily accomplished with accuracy. When the patient is not very old, when the short- ening of the limb is considerable, and when the trochanter feels, on examination, larger than usual, it may be suspected that the injury is not confined to the neck of the bone. This distinction is of little consequence, except in respect to the prognosis, since the treatment proper for both accidents is the same; but recovery188 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, is much more readily accomplished when the fracture is tlirough the trochanters, than when it is confined to the neck In the latter case, most surgeons in this country believe that osseous union is impossible, unless the reflected ligament, or fibrous covering of the neck, which is continuous with the capsule of the joint, remains entire. There is no doubt that the surfaces of the bones are very apt either to continue quite separate, or to be tmited by a flexible fibrous medium. But none of the argu- ments which have been adduced to prove the impossibility of osseous junction seem to be conclusive ; and though the small extent and mobility of the broken surfaces, the absence of vascular tissues surrounding the fracture, and perhaps also the presence of the synovial fluid, may render the cure very difficult, it ought stiU to be regarded as a possible occurrence. An attempt, therefore,, to unite the fracture ought always to be made, and if it fails, the patient will at least have no ground to reflect on the careless treatment of his attendant. Thie .long^lint affords the most effectual means of preserving the proper position, but has been objected to on the ground that the pressure on the instep of the foot which its use may occasion is very apt to cause mor- tification in the old people who are subject to the accident. As extension is not required, there should be little risk of this dis- agreeable effect; but if it were to appear, the limb ought to be immediately freed from all restraint, and simply laid over a large pillow or folded bolster, which will tend to prevent displacement of the fractured surfaces. A fibrous connection wOl then be gradually formed, with more or less shortening of the thigh ; and as strength retui'ns, the patient should, by cold affusion, and gentle exercise, endeavour to regain the use of the limb. In process of time he becomes able to walk with the assistance of a staff and high-heeled shoe. In fractru-e through the trochanters osseous reunion is certaioly and readily accomplished, provided the limb be kept steady in a proper position ; and, judging from my own experience, I should say, that the long spHnt may always be safely employed for this piu'pose, since it is reqiui'ed merely to prevent motion of the limb. \BONES. 189 Of the bones of the fore-am the radius is most liable to be fractured, and generally gives way about an inch above the wrist. The accident is usually occasioned by falls on the palm of the hand. It is recognised by the ordinary characters of fracture, and is often rendered very obvious by the hand being bent in- wards, owing to the pronator radii quadratm drawing the broken extremities of the bone towards the ulna; or by the distal end of the radius being driven backwards so as to make the proximal one project under the integuments of the wrist. When there is little distortion the treatment requires merely the prevention of motion; and this is easily effected by applying a couple of splints and a bandage, which may be a simple roller, as it can be readily changed without deranging the fracture. When the hand is in- verted, it has been thought necessary to use some counteracting power on the same principle as for fractured fibula; but it is found sufficient to apply a couple of wooden splints narrower than the width of the arm, and long enough to reach from the elbow to the fingers, and thus have such a purchase on the hand as may prevent its inversion by the action of the muscles. The shaft of the ulna also is occasionally broken alone, but not nearly so frequently as the radius. The cause is violence acting directly on the injured part. There is generally little displacement; and the treatment is consequently very easy, re- quiring merely splints and a bandage. The olecranon is sometimes broken from the shaft of the bone by falls on the elbow. When the tough ligamentous covering of the process remains entire, the fragment suffers no displacement, and its lateral mobility is the only indication of the fracture, in addition to pain, swelling, and crepitus. But when this fibrous connection is ruptured, the triceps pulls up the detached olecranon to the distance of an inch or more from its proper place. This fracture, in several important respects, resembles that of the patella and neck of the femur; and, ac- cordingly, like them, is repaired by a fibro-cartilaginous medium instead of bone. With proper care, however, the broken sur- faces may be kept so near each other, that no inconvenience is190 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. experienced on this account. The treatment obviously requires that the limb should be extended, and this is best done by plac- ing a splint on the fore-part of the Umb, a figure of 8 bandage having been previously applied, so as to retain the fragment in its proper position. Both the bones of the fore-arm are sometimes broken to- gether, but this is a rare occurrence, and happens either from falls on the hand or blows on the arm. The accident is readily recognised, and easily treated through means of a couple of splints, supported by a roller ; and if the patient is thin, a lon- gitudinal compress placed between the radius and ulna on both sides of the limb. The humerus is very liable to fracture in almost every part of its extent; and in respect to the diagnosis and treatment, it is necessary to consider the accident as occurring through the shaft,—through the neck,—and through the condyles. The shaft is broken most frequently about its middle,.i)e- tween the attachments of the deltoid and hracMceus intgmm muscles. The fracture is usually transverse, and very readily recognised by the flexibility of the limb at the injured part. It is caused by falls, blows, and inordinate actions of the muscles, as in throwing a stone. The treatment consists in applying splints on the mner and outer sides of the arm, extending from the axilla and acromion process to the olecranon, supported by a bandage, which may be a simple roller, or, if there is much swelling, of the looped kind; the elbow ought to be bent at a right angle, to relax the muscles equally, and supported in a sling, if the patient is kept out of bed. When the fracture is seated above the insertion of the deltoid, the lower extremity is apt to be drawn so forcibly upwards as not to admit of being secured by the means which have been mentioned. In this case the patient must lie in bed, with the arm separated from •the side so as to relax the deltoid, while it is supported by the splints usually required. The humeinas may be fractured at its lower extremity either ^ obliquely or transversely, so as to detach one or both of itsBONES. 191 condyles. Such accidents are generally caused by falls on the hand or elbow, and though they not uufrequently occvir in adults, are particularly common in children, and very apt to be mistaken for dislocation of the fore-arm backwards. The trans- verse fracture may be distinguished by the deformity disappear- ing on slight extension, and returning when the limb is left to itself, but is best detected by extending and bending the fore- arm alternately while one hand embraces the elbow. The oblique fracture is easily recognised if the external and internal tuberosities be pressed backwards and forwards with the two hands. The treatment of this injury is extremely simple, re- quiring merely compresses of tow before and behind, and a figure of 8 bandage applied while the bones are carefully held in the proper position, the elbow-joint being afterwards kept at a right angle. But the consequences of mistaking the nature of the case, and leaving the limb unsupported after extension has temporarily restored it to proper shape, are most distressing, the arm being always deformed, and generally stiff. "When the fracture occurs above the attachments of the pec- tor alis major and latissimus dor si, it is said to be in the neck of the humerus. In this case the muscles just mentioned draw the lower portion of the bone towards the side, while the supra- spxTiatus and other muscles inserted into the tuberosities cause the upper fragment to project forwards and rather oiitwards. This accident happens from falls on the shoulder, and is easily recognised by placing one hand in the axilla, while the other subjects the humerus alternately to abduction and addiiction. The treatment reqiiires a compress in the axilla to counteract the effect of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, with a spica bandage to restrain the upper extremity of the bone from being everted, and a sling to support the Umb. The clavicle is freq\xently fractured, by external violence acting directly, and also when transmitted through more or less extent of the superior extremity. The pain, swelling, mobility, and crepitus of the broken part, which is usually about the beginning of the acromial curvature, readily betray the injury,192 PRINCIPLES OT" SURGEKY. which is rendered still more obvious by the sternal extremity of the bone being drawn upwards by the stemo-mastoid muscle, and the shoulder being depressed, brought nearer the sternum, and rendered more prominent forwards by the action of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, assisted by the weight of the limb. In children the displacement is much less observable than in adults, owing to the lightness of their arms, and hence the injury in them is frequently not discovered until the swell- ing which attends reunion attracts attention. Great difficulty seems to have been experienced in treating this fracture efficiently ; and Desault's method, though compli- cated and troublesome, was formerly regarded the best for the purpose. It consists of a thick cushion fixed in the axilla, to serve as a fulcnmi for removing the shoulder outwards to its proper position, by means of the humerus when brought close to the side; a bandage to keep this cushion steady, another to fasten the arm, and a third to elevate the shoulder, by drawing up the affected elbow. But when the cushion in the axilla is secured so high and so firmly as really to serve the office of a fulcrum, it compresses the nerves and blood-vessels beyond endurance ; and if it be allowed to descend so as not to do this, it increases the distortion, by separating the arm from the side. The method which, on the whole, appears to be the most simple and efficient, is to brace back the shoulders by a figure of 8 bandage, or shoulder-straps drawn together by any simple con- trivance : and having thus obviated the distortion, except so far as regards the depression caused by the weight of the limb, to remedy this also,' by placing the affected arm obliquely across the chest, with the fingers pointing to the opposite acromion, and securing it iii this position by means of a shng or bandage. In difficult cases the patient should be treated in the horizontal posture, which of course greatly lessens the tendency to dis- placement. The scapiila may be broken through the acromion process, ^egk, body, and inferior angle. The first of these fractures is the most common, the others being very rare. It happens fromBONES. 193 direct violence,- occasions nearly the same symptoms as fractured clavicle, but not so well marked, and requires similar treatment. The neck of the scapid.a is broken by violence, transmitted thi'ough the humerus. The symptoms of this fracture are filling up of the axillary cavity by the head of the h\imerus,—a hollow imder the acromion process from the bone being out of its place, —and easy restoration of the parts to their natural position, when the shoulder is gently extended outwards ; during which adjustment there is usually some crepitus perceived. The treat- ment required is the same as that recommended for fracture of the neck of the humerus. The nasal bones, though very thin at their extremity, be- coming gradually tliicker towards their connection with the os frontis, and having a strong support afforded to them by the projecting process of this bone, on which, together with the ascending branches of the superior maxillary, they are firmly placed, suffer fracture less frequently than might be expected from their exposed situation. The fracture, when it does occur, is generally comminuted, and easily recognised by the striking deformity which arises from the flatteniag and obliquity of the nose necessarily attending it. A great degree of violence being requisite to occasion the injury, there is usually much swelling, which is apt to conceal the displacement of the bones, if the ex- amination be not made immediately after the accident is sus- tained. Whence it is proper, in all cases where the injuiy may be suspected, to search very carefully for it, since the inevitable consequence of its being overlooked wo\ild be a deformity equally disagreeable and irremediable. The depressed portions of bone may be easily elevated before they become consolidated by the effusion that ensues, and after being pressed up into their proper places by a pair of dressing forceps, or other suitable in- strument, generally remain without requu'ing permanent support. Should they prove not sufficiently steady, a piece of lint ought to be carefully introduced, so as to distend the upper part of the cavity. The lower jaw, though much exposed to violence by itsPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 194 situation, is comparatively seldom broken, owing to its mobility and strength. The fracture is usually seated in the base of the bone, opposite the bicuspid teeth. It is sometimes confined to one side, sometimes exists in both. It very rarely happens in the ramiis, and is hardly ever met with at the symphysis. The nature and seat of the injury are readily recognised, owing to the thinness of the parts which cover the jaw; and it is generally observed that the portion of the bone next the chin is depressed, partly by its own weight, partly by the action of the muscles which connect it with the os hyoides. The broken surfaces are easily retained in contact, by tying up the jaw' with a handkerchief, or any similar bandage. A pasteboard splint is sometimes applied along the front and sides of the bone, but is in general quite unnecessary. Another contrivance frequently recommended appears, if possible, still less necessary—viz., interposing a piece of wood or cork between the teeth, grooved so as to receive them in a chamael both above and below. This is done to restrain motion of the jaw, and afiford room for the introduction of nourishnient; but the shape of the teeth effectually prevents any lateral movement when they are held together by a bandage, and there are always suf- ficient interstices between them to admit the entrance of soups or other fluid articles of food, which kind of nutriment alone the patient is of coiu-se able to consume, when deprived of the power of mastication. In cases where, owing to the obliquity of the fracture, or any other cause, it is found unusually difficult to maintain the edges of the bone in contact, a thread or silver wire may be tied or twisted round the roots of the adjoining teeth, so as to draw them together; but this expedient should not be resorted to unnecessarily, since it is apt to loosen the teeth concerned. . The ribs are generally broken by direct violence, but also by pressure applied to their extremities, which difference in the cause has been supposed to modify the consequences of the ac- cident ; siace, when the fracture is caused by direct -\dolence, the rough spicula of bone are projected inwards, and readily in-BONES. 195 jure the pleura or lungs ; but when the rib is broken by being- bent outwards by approximation of the sternum to the spine, the parts contained within the chest are less endangered. The fracture is attended with pain, aggravated by respira- tion, and by obscm-e crepitus, which is best ascertaiaed by placing the hand on the injui'ed part while the patient breathes. The diagnosis is frequently far from easy, from the patient's ina- bility to bear the necessary examination ; but its accuracy is not essential, since the treatment proper for fracture is the same with that required for a bruise of the muscles, the only injiuy with which it can be confounded. A broad bandage ought to be applied tightly round the chest, and bleeding, purgatives, and tartrate of antimony must be used according to circumstances. Fractures of the cranium and vertebrae, being of consequence chiefly on account of their connection with accompanying in- juries of the brain and spinal marrow, will be considered most advantageously along with these subjects. The great strength and arched form of the pelvis enable it to resist all ordinary degrees of violence, and it is only when sub- jected to the most powerful compression, as from the weight of a loaded carriage or the force of machinery, that the bones com- posing it give way. They yield most frequently in the horizon- tal and descending branches of the os pubis, and at the same time there is usually a separation of the sacro-Uiac synchon- drosis on one or both sides. The precise extent of the injury can hardly be ascertained, except by dissection ; but the existence of fracture is generally rendered manifest by the pain, mobility, and crepitus which attend it. Sometimes it is made still more obvious by the ramus of the ischium or puMs being driven thi-ough the perineum, or the coats of the rectum. Such fractures are almost certainly fatal, from the great shock of the system and injury of important organs with which they are accompanied; but the patient ought always to be afforded the chance of recovery, by binding the pelvis tightly with a broad circidar bandage, and protecting him from excite- ment of every kind.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 196 The crest of the ilium is occasionally broken by falls and blows; the accident is easily recognised, produces no serious consequences, and reqmres merely rest, with a spica bandage. Diastasis or Separation of the Epiphyses. . ' Before the epiphyses are united to their respective shafts, they may suifer separation from them by such violence as, in the adult, would occasion fracture of the bones concerned, or dislocation of their articulating extremities. The sjrmptoms will resemble those which would result from fracture in the same situation, and the treatment does not in any respect require to be different. Bending of the Bones. While the bones are young and jflexible, they sometimes bend instead of breaking, when subjected to forces that would occasion fracture in the adult; or rather give way only par- tially, so that, while altered in form, they still retain some power of resistance. As this accident is not attended with either mobility or crepitus, it is very apt to be overlooked, the distortion of the limb being attributed to swelling of the soft parts, in consequence of the injury. The bones of the fore-arm are most liable to suffer in this way. In order to remove the curvature, and prevent it from permanently deforming and im- peding the use of the limb, it is necessary, without loss of time, to employ force sufficient for straightening the bone. If this is done effectually, subsequent mechanical support will hardly be required ; but if, from delay or undecided measures in the first instance, the bones should remain bent, they ought if possible to be straightened by force, and maintained so by rigid splints. False Joints. Fractured bones sometimes do not unite firmly together, their extremities being connected by a flexible fibrous medium. The most common examples of this occurrence are afforded by the pateUa and neck of the femur ; but there is hardly any of197 BONES. the long bones in which it may not take place. Its consequences are in general extremely distressing, since the want of due rigidity renders the limbs very imperfect, and sometimes quite useless, for performing their ordinary duties. The principal cause of this occuiTence is unquestionably the want of due fixture, wliich prevents the fractured extremities from remaining at rest, it being well ascertained that false joints may be certainly produced by subjecting the bones concerned to frequent motion. The best means of prevention are consequently to set the fracture as early as possible, and afterwards to retain the bones steadily in their proper places. Before considering the treatment of false joints, it is neces- sary to ascertain the nature of the structure which constitutes them. It is often said to be similar to that of the natural arti- culations, being composed of two opposite plates of cartilage, a covering of synovial membrane, and a capsular ligament. But in most cases there is merely a tough, fibrous, ligamentous-look- ing texture, which extends from one extremity of the bone to the other; and the nearest approximation to a new articulation which almost ever occurs, consists in the existence of cavities more or less extensive, between the fibres of this connecting substance. The best treatment in general is to maintain perfect rest by particularly careful employment of the usual means. Should this not prove sufficient, the plan originally devised by Mr. White of Manchester in 1760, may be employed. This was to •cut down upon the extremities of the bone, and saw them off; after which, the ordinary treatment of compound fracture being employed, the limb regained its firmness, with more or less shortening, according to circumstances. This operation is greatly facilitated by the use of cutting pliers instead of a saw. It ought not, however, to be performed until the more gentle means have proved unavailing, and unless the patient suffers so much incon- venience from the want of rigidity as to waiTant such a severe proceeding. In the humerus and fore-arm, the muscles are so equally balanced, that the limb, though quite flexible at thePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 198 injured part, can sometimes be used for most of the purposes for wliich it is required. In ununited fracture of the thigh bone, the limb is always distorted, from the imperfect resistance opposed by the broken bone to the contraction of the muscles, and there thus results an arched form of the thigh. On the convexity of this arch, which is directed outwards and forwards, a cushion formed of a sheet or table-cloth, folded into the requisite size, is placed, and upon this is made to rest the long splint, which is then drawn tightly towards the knee and pelvis. There is thus not only exerted a constant force, urging the bone into its straight direction, but also the most perfect stability afforded to the frac- tured surfaces. Within the last few years I have succeeded com- pletely in six cases of unimited fracture of the humerus—some of which were of no less than twelve months' standing—by envelop- ing the whole limb, from the scapula to the finger-points, in a firm starch and pasteboard case, which was prepared before the opera- tion of excising the ends of the bone, taken off at the time of its performance, and reapplied when the wound had nearly healed. Inflammation of Bone. Inflammation of the periosteum, and that of the bone itself, frequently occur together, give rise to similar symptoms, and requii-e nearly the same treatment. The former, or Periostitis, is characterised by deep-seated aching pain, and thickening of the integuments, which adliere to the part affected. These symptoms vaiy much in the degree of their acuteness, and are accordingly accompanied with more or less constitutional derangement. The disease frequently becomes periodically aggravated, ^d is apt to be increased by all sorts of excitement. It is usually most severe during the night, and after meals. The periosteum is most liable to inflammation where it covers bones near the siu'- face of the body, as the shin-bone, the skull-cap, the clavicle, and sternum. In the chronic form of the disease, it is generally possible to trace the operation of a predisposing, as well as of an exciting, cause. The former seems to consist in derangement of the system199 BONES. from various circumstances, but most frequently from the preju- dicial use of mercury co-operating with venereal disease, espe- cially in a scrofulous constitution. The latter includes exposure to cold and wet, and blows. Middle-aged adults are the most common subjects of its attack. The mode of treatment depends upon the intensity of the symptoms. When they are very violent, and attended with smart fever, the most effectual practice is to make a free incision tlirough the inflamed parts down to the bone. When less severe, they yield to leeching or cupping, warm anodyne fomentations, camphorated mercurial ointment with anodyne liniment, and opium administered internally along with calomel, ipecacuan, tartrate of antimony, or colchicum. When still more chronic, they require repeated blistering, with an alterative course of the hydriodate of potass, or the oxymuriate of mercury—six grains of the former, or haK a grain of the latter, being given daily in divided doses. The decoction of sarsaparilla is generally pre- scribed, but I believe without any beneficial effect, farther than inducing the patient to conform to dietetic rule. The forma,tion of matter is a very common consequence of chronic periostitis,, but, in this case, absorption may generally be induced by using the means just mentioned; and, therefore, an opening of the cavity ought to be avoided. Should it take place spontaneously, moist dressing, with occasional bhsters, will be found the best means of treatment. Inflammation of the substance of the bone occurs under simi- lar circumstances, and is attended with nearly the same symp- toms. The pain is, if possible, still more deep, dull, and aching; the integuments, though exhibiting the same changes in the pro- gress of the disease, are not so much altered in the first instance, and the swelling affects the shape of the bone more extensively. Wlien acute, it generally terminates in death of the dense osse- ous tissue, and in suppuration of the spongy bone. When chronic, it expands the texture of the shafts, so as to make them larger and less compact, and in the cancellated texture usually induces either absorption or suppuration.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 200 The treatment is to be conducted on the same principles as that of periostitis. Wlien the inflammation is acute, it termi- nates very speedily in absorption, suppuration, or death of the part affected, and seems to be hardly influenced by any remedial measure. But when chronic, it is more under control, yielding in the dense bones to blisters, employed along with alterative medicines, and in the spongy bones to the actual cautery. The swellings which are occasioned, both by chronic periostitis and inflammation of the bone itself, are called Nodes. Necrosis. The expression Necrosis has been employed to denote dif- ferent morbid affections of the osseous tissue, and has conse- quently given rise to much confusion. It literally implies merely the deprivation of life, but has been imderstood to denote also the consequent reproduction of new osseous substance. All the bones are liable to necrosis, but those which possess a dense texture are more subject to it than the spongy ones. The causes of necrosis are various. It was formerly believed that the mere removal of the periosteum certainly caused the death of a scale of the bone more or less thick, by dej)riving it of nourishment, and hence it was a rule, with the old surgeons, to hasten exfoliation in all such cases by applying the actual or potential cautery. But it is now ascertained that simply remov- ing the periosteum does not necessarily cause exfoliation, and that when a bone throws off a scale, after being so exposed, it generally does so in consequence of the injury which it has sus- tained from the violence that occasioned the separation of the membrane. Blows, falls, strains, and exposure to cold, are the causes that most frequently give rise to necrosis, and they act either directly, by at once destroying the vitality of the part affected, or indirectly, by exciting inflammation, wliich terminates in the death of the bone. The inflammation, when acute, is not confined to the bone, but generally affects all the superjacent tissues ; whence it has .been erroneously supposed, from redness of the skin being present, that erysipelas or inflammation of the201 BONES. skin may induce necrosis. There often seems to be a constitu- tional proneness to necrosis, so that many bones of the same person die together or successively. This disposition exists most frequently in childhood, and is almost always associated with, perhaps dependent upon, weakness of the system. The dead portion appears as if it had been long and carefully macerated, being hard, white, brittle, and sonorous when struck with a probe. If exposed to the air previous to separation, it suffers various alterations of colour, and generally, in part at least, becomes black; but this depends upon the discharge of the sore, and the action of the air. It is named an Exfoliation, and gradually separates from the living bone by ulcerative absorption. The circumstances which attend the process of exfoliation and its reparation vary much, accordingly as it affects the external sur- face, internal surface, or the whole thickness of the bone con- cerned. External Exfoliation.—The external surface of bones being most exposed to those injuries which cause exfoliation either directly by their violence, or indirectly by exciting inflammation, most frequently suffers from it; and, of the particular bones, those nearest the surface of the body, as the tibia and cranium, are, as might be expected, more especially liable. The separa- tion of the dead portion, being effected by a process of the living system, does not admit of any assistance from the surgeon, whose interference could hardly fail to do harm, by injuring the adjoin- ing sound bone. Free, vent ought to be afforded by proper inci- sions to the matter, which is copiously secreted; and the exfo- liation should be examined from time to time with the probe, to ascertain whether or not it has become detached. So soon as it is found to be loose, it ought to be removed by means of forceps, either through the opening which already exists in the integu- ments, or a suitable extension of it. The remaining surface granulates, and osseous matter is effused under the pellicle, so as to fill up the breach partially, but usually leaving a permanent depression at the part. Internal Exjoliation.—It is of course only in the cylindrical202 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. bones that exfoliation from an internal surface can take place ; and tliose of the largest size are most frequently the seat of it. The cause is almost always inflammation, since the injuries which directly occasion necrosis can rarely operate on the interior of a bone. The exfoliation in this situation is named a seques- trum. It separates from the sound bone as in the former case ; but having done so, cannot escape through the walls of the shaft withiu which it is enclosed, and therefore remains a source of irritation. The living bone, in consequence, becomes greatly thickened, and new osseous matter is copiously effused from its external surface, in the form of irregular projecting tubercles. At the same time the pus, which is pent up within the cavity, by its pressure on the parietes, induces absorption, and the for- mation of cylindrical apertures through the shell of the bone. These doom, as they are named, allow the confined matter to escape, and present itseK under the integuments in the form of an abscess, which, if not opened by the surgeon, sooner or later evacuates its contents by ulcei-ation. Thus far during the pro- cess, the patient suffers from pain and swelling of the limb, but after the matter obtains free vent, he finds himself greatly re- lieved. The enlargement, though it does not disappear alto- gether, subsides very much, and so little uneasiness remains that he is generally able to make some use of the limb. If it should fortunately happen that the sequestrum is not only small, but also favourably situated for escaping throijgh a cloaca, the source of irritation being thus removed, the patient may be restored to health. But if the sequestra do not pass out spontaneously, the surgeon, having ascertained their presence by the probe, must enlarge the opening which leads into the cavity containing them, so as to obtain space sufficient for their extraction. In order to do this, he makes a simple, or, if the part admits of it, a cnicial incision through the integuments, having the cloaca for its centre, dissects back the flaps, and applies the trephine over the opening should there be room for doing so, and if not, as is usually the case, he employs the cutting-pliers to enlarge the opening sufii-203 BONES. ciently. The process of extraction may sometimes be facilitated by dividing the sequestrum into pieces. Exfoliations of the tvhole thickness.—Bones die throughout their whole thickness from causes similar to those which induce exfoliation of their external or internal surface, and the dead portion separates from the living by the same process of absorp- tion that occurs in such cases ; but the state of the bones, after the cure is completed, requires in this case particular considera- tion. Sometimes the place of the dead part is not at all, or very imperfectly, supplied ; at other times its separation could hardly be suspected from any change visible in the shape or size of the bone affected. In order to accoimt for this remarkable differ- ence, it is necessary to inquire into the circumstances of the cases in which it is exhibited. In some cases, when the dead bone is detached, the remain- ing surface merely granulates, just as after the separation of an exfoliation which extends only partially through the whole thick- ness, and effuses sufficient osseous matter to round off the edges, thus lessening the extent of the gap, but still leaving a perman- ent deficiency at the part. The same result ensues when a por- tion of bone, including its whole thickness, is removed mechani- cally. But at other times the dead portion is found to be con- tained within a more or less complete case of new bone, which is ready to take the place of the old one whenever it is removed, by contracting its sides together so as to become a solid mass. It was formerly supposed that the death and reproduction of .an entire shaft, in this way, was a very common event, all cases of internal exfoliation being regarded as instances of its occur- rence, and the expression Necrosis has been generally employed to denote this remarkable process. It might have been supposed that when only small sequestra made their appearance, or were found on dissection, decisive proof would have been afforded of the partial extent of the disease. But the general swelling of the limb, which is caused by the irritation of an internal exfoliation, having led to the erroneous belief that an entire new shell was forming about the old bone, the non-appearance of a sequestrum,204 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. adequate to the supposed extent of destruction, was accounted for by attributing its diminution or removal to the absorbing power of the vessels, or the solvent property of the pus. It is now weU. ascertained that the sequestrum cannot be acted upon in either of these ways; and that its size may, therefore, be safely taken as a measure of the extent to which the bone has died. According to this test, it is found that the death and regenera- tion of an entire shaft, so far from being a very common occur- rence, is an extremely rare one; and some pathologists, as Leveill^ have gone so far as to deny it altogether, alleging that more or less of the external part of the old bone always remains, and becomes expanded into the new shell There can be no doubt, however, judging from the size, shape, and smooth surface, of the sequestrum, that it sometimes, though certainly very seldom, comprehends the whole thickness and circumference of the shaft. The origin of the substitute in cases of this kind has been variously explained. It must evidently proceed—1. From granu- lating action of the portion that remains. 2. JFrom the old bone previous to its death. Or, 3. From ossification of the periosteum or other suiTounding tissues. The first of these opinions has been supported by Eicherand and others, who regard as strongly in their favour the fact, that more or less of the old shaft, and at all events the epiphysis, always remains. But in external exfo- liations the granulating action seldom, if ever, fills up the breach; and when a considerable portion of the whole thickness of a bone is destroyed suddenly by inflammation, or is removed by mechani- cal means, the loss of substance is in general not fully restored, wluch it ought to be, according to this view of the matter. In cases where no permanent deficiency remains after the separa- tion of the dead bone, it is generally noticed that the limb be- comes enlarged previously to tliis event; and experiments on the lower animals, as well as observations of what happens in the human body, have been thought to shew that the new shell may begin to be formed before the death of the old shaft. Dr. Mac- donald remarked (1799), that the new bone, when first formed,205 BONES. adhered inseparably to the old one; and the late Professor Eussell injected the vessels of the old shaft, while its substitute was in progress of formation. It has hence been concluded, that the ossifying process originates from the old bone ; and that un- less the foundation of a new one be laid by it, previously to its own death, the loss of substance wiU not be replaced. But it has been fuUy ascertained, as weU by experiment in the lower animals as from observation of disease in the human body, that a bone, though suddenly deprived of life, may still be reproduced; and, on the whole, it seems clearly established, that the periosteum must be regarded the main source of reproduction. The views which I entertain on this subject will best appear froni the fol- lowing extract from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Udinhirgh^' " The property of forming new bone was first attributed to the periosteum by Duhamel, about a hundred years ago. Hav- ing been engaged in the study of vegetable physiology, and more particularly in regard to the formation of wood, he imagined that there might be an analogy between the inner layer of the bark and the periosteum, and that as the former hardens in successive layers so as to constitute the wood, the latter might suffer a cor- responding conversion into bone. He supported this opinion by the following arguments:—1. That when bones are burned in the fire, or exposed to the weather, they separate into a number of thin plates. 2. That, in consequence of disease aris- ing from external violence, the bones frequently throw off thin stjales, or exfoliations as they are called. 3. That when animals are fed alternately with madder and without it, their bones exhibit alternate layers of a red and white colour; and, 4, That when bones are fractured, they unite by means of an osseous capsule formed externally to, and embracing the broken extremi- ties, just as the branch of a tree acquires strength after being grafted, or simply broken across, " This theory of Duhamel was strenuously opposed by Haller, who urged, as altogether inconsistent with it, the mode in wliich * Vol. xiv. 1837.PRINCIPLES OP SURGERY. 206 bones are originally formed. He carefuUy investigated the pro- cess of ossification during incubation, and detailed the steps of its progress in the chick as well as other young animals. The rudiment of the future bone being traced from its earliest dis- tinguishable appearance, was found first to present the characters of a jelly; then to acquire the consistence of cartilage or gristle; and finally to reach the perfect osseous state: whence it was contended, that a structure which thus originated in a distinct form, and independently of any other, could not owe its increase afterwards to a different source. HaUer also engaged his pupils Detlef and Boehmer in extensive series of experiments, by break- ing the bones of animals, and feeding them with madder during their recovery ; fi-om the results of which he inferred, that Du- hamel had been mistaken in supposing that fractures are re- united by ossification of the periosteum, " Notwithstanding these objections, and the authority of the physiologist from whom they proceeded, the doctrine of Duhamel stUl maintained its ground; and not long afterwards—^viz., in the year 1780—derived a great accession of strength from the experiments of Troja, who, by destroying the marrow of bones, caused their death, and the formation of new shells surrounding them, apparently from ossification of the periosteum. Tliis ex-r periment, which Troja himself performed some hundreds of times, when repeated and varied by the pathologists of almost every country, seemed to confirm the ossific power attributed to the periosteum beyond question, until Scarpa, the distinguished Professor of Pavia, again investigated the grounds on which it was originally founded by Duhamel, In Scai^pa's treatise,' De Penitiori Ossium Structura,' which was published in 1799, he explained that the foliated appearance, presented by bones that had been burnt, did not depend upon the development of a structure naturally belonging to them, but was an effect pro- duced by the unequal action of the fire ; and that the separation of scales from diseased bones was no stronger proof of their pos- sessing a laminated structure, since thin and broad portions of dead substance are wont to be detached from the skin and otherBONES. 207 soft textures, in which it was never supposed that layers existed naturally. He recalled attention to the synthetic experiments of Haller, who, by investigating the formation of bone from the earliest stage to its perfect state, had established the reticulated nature of its texture; and by an opposite process of an analytic kind, which consisted in depriving bones of their earthy consti- tuent by means of diluted acids, and then macerating them for a long while in water, he unravelled the texture so as to shew that it really was reticular. As a consequence of these observa- tions, Scarpa denied that bone could be formed by the peri- osteum ; and this opinion was keenly embraced by several pathologists of the present century, and particularly by the French surgeon Leveill^. " At present, professional opinion is divided in regard to the ossific power of the periosteum, and different sides of the ques- tion are maintained by teachers and writers in this as weU as other schools of medicine. As the point in dispute is not merely a matter of curiosity, but one of great practical importance, it is very desirable that the truth should be ascertained. It wordd detain the Society too long were I to show how the different opinions on this subject may influence the practice of surgery ; and I shall, therefore, proceed to state the considerations which have completely satisfied my own mind, and are, I think, suffi- cient to satisfy any one who is open to conviction, that though Duhamel was misled into many errors by the false analogy which he supposed to exist between wood and bone—in regard to the mode of their natural formation—the periosteum, never- theless, does possess the power of producing new osseous sub- stance in certain conditions of disease. "The well-known and often-repeated experiment of Troja, which consisted in perforating the cavity and destroying the marrow of a bone, so as to kill it and cause the formation of a substitute in the form of a shell surrounding the old one, was devised in imitation of a process which not unfrequently occurs spontaneously in the human body. In this disease, which has been named Necrosis, a portion of the old bone dies, and becomes208 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. surrounded by a new one. Tlie new shell is of a larger size and more irregular form than the old one, which may be seen through a number of circular apertures lying a prisoner within this struc- ture, intended by Nature to serve as a substitute for it. Those who deny the ossific power of the periosteum maintain, that in all such cases, whether resulting from injury purposely inflicted with the view of experiment, or proceeding from diseased action, a portion of the old bone remains alive, and serves as the germ of a new one; that, in short, the formation of the new bone is simply an expansion or growth from the remnant of the old one, and that if merely the extremities of the bone affected remain alive, they will prove sufficient for generating the substitute shell. " It is difficult to reconcile this explanation with the rapid growth and uniform thickness of the new bone; since, if its forma- tion proceeded from the extremities, the process should be slow and progressive towards the centre; but there is another objection still more conclusive against it. If the new bone is formed by a portion of the old one that remains aHve, then the removal of a part by mechanical means should be supplied from the same source. But in all the cases where this has been done, either in the way of experiment, or for the cure of disease, the loss of sub- stance, unless of small extent, has been found imperfectly re- paired. For instance, after the operation of trepanning the skull, the aperture in the bone, though it becomes diminished in extent, is not altogether obliterated, and the newly-formed bone is not only smaller than the portion removed, but also thinner. " In the fore-legs of dogs and rabbits, there are two bones of nearly equal size, and so connected, that a large portion of one may be taken away without destroying the rigidity of the limb. There is here, therefore, a convenient opportunity of trying what can be done by the extremities of a bone for restoring losses of substance in its shaft. Experiments of this kind have, accord- ingly, been frequently performed on these animals, and the result has uniformly been, that when the portion removed exceeded an inch in length, there was a permanent deficiency of osseous sub-BONES. 209 stance, the ends of tlie bone being merely produced towards each other in a conical form, and connected together by a tough liga- mentous texture. Sir A. Cooper has given representations of the results he met with; and I have met with others precisely similar. " Some of those pathologists who deny the ossific power of the periosteum, and claim the whole production of new osseous sub- stance for the bone itself, have attempted to explain away the difficulties which have just been stated, by supposing that, in cases of necrosis where a new bone is formed, the old one, in consequence of the increased action preceding its death, may de- termine the effusion of organizable matter into the surrounding soft textures, which will serve as a matrix or foundation for the new shell, and be ready to take up the ossifying process so soon as it is communicated from the surviving extremities of the bone. That the process of reproduction may be accomplished in this way I am not prepared to deny, but that it is not necessarily, or always so performed, will, I think, appear from the following case :— " A girl, twelve years of age, strained her ankle in the month of March 1835. Inflammation followed, extending up to the knee, and attended with violent fever. She was brought to the hospital, and placed under my care. Incisions were soon after- wards made to evacuate a large collection of matter which had formed in the leg; and the bone being found dead, while the patient's strength was rapidly giving way, I amputated the limb above the knee five weeks after the injury had been received. The girl recovered, and is now well. In examining the limb to ascertain the extent to which the bone had died, I found that it Avas partially surrounded by the commencement of a new one. The shell had already acquired considerable firmness at some parts, but was not equally thick throughout, and did not seem fixed to the ends of the old shaft. Tliis observation led to a very careful dissection of the parts concerned; and they are now before the Society. It will be seen that the tibia had died very nearly from end to end, and that the new shell enclosing pPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 210 it lias been formed in the periosteum. The new osseous substance may be observed at some parts in the form of small distinct scales. At other parts it looked as if it had originally consisted of separate portions, and been composed by their union. The periosteum connecting these portions to each other and to the extremities of the bone was not thickened beyond its natui-al condition; and where it covered the posterior surface of the tibia, though quite detached fi'om the old bone, had not suffered any further change. It also appeared that at those parts where the periosteum was absent, no new bone had been formed, so that the cloacce would have been formed by these defective portions, and not by absorption, as was supposed to be always the case. " There is here, then, an instance of a bone dying suddenly in consequence of acute inflammation, without any thickening pre- viously formed in its neighbourhood, and nevertheless sxicceeded by the production of a new osseous shell, which evidently could not proceed from the old bone, and no less evidently depended upon an ossific process resident in the periosteum. " As Nature is not capricious or variable in her proceedings, I regard this case as sufficient of itself, without any further evidence, to establish the ossific power of the periosteum. But, with the view of making the matter stUl more clear, I performed the following experiments. I exposed the radius of a dog, and removed an inch and three-quarters of it together with the periosteum. At the same time I exposed the radius of the other leg, and removed a corresponding portion without the periosteum, which was carefully detached from it and left quite entire, except where slit open in front. Six weeks afterwards the dog was killed, and the bones examined. In the one, from which a portion had been taken together with the periosteum, the ex- tremities were found extended towards each other in a conical form, with a great deficiency of bone between them, and in its place merely a small band of tough ligamentous texture. In the other, where the periosteum had been allowed to remain, there was a compact mass of bone not only occupying the211 BONES. space left by the portion removed, but rather exceeding it in thickness. This experiment, when repeated, afforded the same results. " I next exposed the radius of another dog, and separated the periosteum from the bone as in the former experiment; but then, instead of cutting out the denuded bone, inserted a thin plate of metal between it and the periosteum. The edges of the membrane, and then those of the skin, were sewed together, and the wound healed Idndly. At the end of six weeks I dissected the limb, and found a deposition of osseous substance in the periosteum, forming a bony plate exterior to the metal, and not connected with the old bone except by the membrane. " I lastly exposed the radius of a dog, and cut away the perios- teum to the same extent that it had been merely detached in the experiment just mentioned, and surrounded the denuded bone with a piece of metal. At the end of six weeks I found a thick tough capsule formed, enclosing the metallic plate, but having no osseous substance in it. " The evidence which has now been adduced seems to me suffi- cient for putting beyond all question the power of the periosteum to form new bone, independently of any assistance from the old one. 1 submit it, with deference, to the Society, in the hope that those members who have directed their attention to the subject win give it their dispassionate consideration, and either admit the opinion which it supports, or shew the fallacy by which it has misled." The treatment of necrosis seldom admits of active measures on the part of the surgeon at its early stage. Abscesses should be opened when they point. Sequestra ought to be assisted to escape, and the patient's strength supported by nourishing diet, and the other usual means. If the death of the bone is so sudden and extensive, that the new shell is not able, in the first instance, to support the strain of the muscles and weight of the limb, splints must be carefully employed until the process of ossification is advanced far enough to render them unnecessary. Finally, in case the patient proves unable to bear the long-continued and exhaust-212 PRINCIPLES OF SUPvGERY. ing exertion requisite for accoraplisliing the cure, he ought to be relieved by amputation. Su^uraiion of Bone and Caries. It is only in the cancellated or spongy texture of bone that inflammation induces suppuration ; the dense parts never taking it on unless they are previously expanded and loosened, in conse- quence of chronic inflammation. In the cancellated texture sup- puration is frequently preceded by scrofulous deposition. The matter may be collected either on the external surface, or in the interior of the bone. In both cases there is more or less excavation, efi"ected by absorption of the bone concerned; and in the latter not only this effect ensues, but also an enlarge- ment of the external shell of the bone, which thus forms an ex- pansion, constituting what is called spina ventosa. The most remarkable example of osseous expansion from the formation of matter with which I am acquainted, is a preparation in the Museum of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. It residted from fracture of the tibia, and existed, progressively increasing, for many years, during which the patient was enabled to discharge the duties of an active life, by closing the orifice with a cork, which he removed from time to time when he. found a convenient opportunity for poui-ing out the accumulated fluid. The cavities which are formed in the cancellated substance of bones, especially in those cases where there has been a pre- vious infiltration of scrofulous formation, frequently contain loose portions of the spongy bone, which have been deprived of vita- lity by the inflammation. When the matter escapes fi-om a hollow of the bone by causing absorption of its sides, or when it is formed, in the first instance, exterior to it, the integuments are elevated, and at length give way, with great relief from the pain which was previously suffered. The abscess may then heal, like an ordinary one of the soft parts, or prove very obstinate, or per- manently resist all means of cure. It is impossible to foretell positively which of these events will ensue, but experience andBONES. 213 attention to the following circumstances generally enable the surgeon to form a pretty accurate opinion as to the result:—1. If the patient possesses a good constitution, and suppuration in the bone has been induced in consequence of inflammation caused by severe external violence, such as the wound of a joint, the prognosis may be favourable. 2. If the patient possesses a bad con- stitution, and the primary inflammation has commenced without any external cause, or one comparatively so slight as a bruise or a strain, which of itself is evidence of his constitution being un- sound, the disease wiU probably be obstinate or incurable. 3. If the patient is an infant or child, and especially if he suffers from suppuration of several bones at the same time, there is a good prospect of an ultimate cure, but not without a very tedious process of recovery. 4. If the suppuration takes place in a bone that naturally possesses a dense texture, but which has been opened out by previous disease, it generally admits of cure more readily than when seated in one originally cancellated. Sir B. Brodie has directed attention to abscesses forming in the cancel- lated texture of bones, but more especially the tibia, and remain- ing latent for an unlimited duration of months or years, the chief S}Tnptoms being enlargement of the bone, with thickening of the soft parts, and deep-seated pain. In such cases he advises the employment of a trephine to evacuate the matter; and this practice has been adopted with advantage. But the operation must not be resorted to without the greatest caution, since chronic periostitis is extremely apt to simulate the condition re- quiring its performance, and has misled practitioners, even of the most extensive experience, to trepan unnecessarily, with effects not less disastrous than even the death of the patient. Whatever be the opinion entertained of the probable result of the case, after the matter has been evacuated, it ought always at first to be treated as if the sore were expected to heal. Free openings should be afforded to the discharge ; stimulating washes, with moderate pressure afterwards applied; and the patient's general health carefully preserved. When the ulcer of the bone resists aU means of cure, it constitutes what is called Caries.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 2U The distinguishing character of caries is obstinacj'' of the dis- ease. The local symptoms vary considerably as to the quantity and quality of the discharge, the degree of pain, and the appear- ance of the orifice. The matter is generally thin and fetid, but sometimes possesses all the properties of perfect pus ; the pain for the most part is gnawing and incessant, but often is hardly perceptible, or on the contrary extremely severe. The orifice is usually smaU and callous, but occasionally exhibits large and flabby granulations. The disease has for the most part remissions more or less complete, and of considerable duration, in which the pain and discharge nearly or altogether cease, and the tilcer seems to be on the point of healing, or actually becomes covered with a cicatrix, which, however, is always thin and soft. But these amendments are only partial and temporary, being always followed by relapse, and there is no natural limit to the duration of the disease except the life of the patient, who, after months, or even many years of suffering, becomes finally exhausted, either by the caries itself, or some other disorder which the in-itation produced by it has excited. Wlien a carious bone has been macerated, the dis- eased part is found excavated and rough, the cancellated texture being remarkably spicular, white, and brittle, so as to resemble a spongy bone which has been exposed to the action of fire. The surface thus affected is often of considerable extent, though frequently very small, even in cases of old standing, but the dis- ease seldom reaches to a considerable depth. The field of the disease seems to be determined by the primaiy inflammation, and after being thus established, has little or no tendency to become larger. Around the carious part there is always an effusion of new osseous matter in the form of spines or tubercles, extending to a considerable distance, and greatly increasing the thickness of the bone. This new mass, which is no doubt produced in con- sequence of the irritation of the disease, like that formed to reunite fractures and supply the place of exfoliations, is charac- terised by compactness and smoothness when minutely examined, though on superficial inspection it appears rough and porous. The pores are apertures for the transmission of blood-vessels, but215 BONES. their form is circular and their edges rounded off, so that sharp edges cannot anywhere be perceived. The newly-effused bone may thus be readily distinguished from the diseased part, to the irritation of-which it owes its origin. It is necessary also to distinsuish between caries, and the excavation of the cancellated texture which is caused by absorption owing to pressure. In this case the bone presents the same appearance that it would do if its external crust were removed by mechanical means; and it possesses none of the whiteness, brittleness, or spicular surface observed in caries. As this difference can hardly be ascertained until after maceration, a more useful distinction is afforded by the history of the case, and whenever the excavation is plainly referrible to pressure, no apprehension need be entertained of caries. It is thought by many that deep-seated collections of matter, if not evacuated early, may occasion caries; but when tliis morbid state of the bone is connected with deep suppuration, it wiU always be found to have been the direct result of the primary inflammation. That mere pressure is not sufficient to produce caries, may be learned from the want of any morbid disposition in the sides of the apertures which are formed by absorption to evacuate matter confined in the cavities of bones. In the living body the carious surface is generally more or less completely covered with imhealthy granulations, which often possess very considerable firmness, and render the discovery of its extent, or even existence, by no means easy. The disease occurs at all ages, but commences most frequently in the early periods of life. It is most frequently met with in persons dis- posed to scrofulous action, and often follows suppuration in bones which have been the seat of deposits proceeding from that morbid disposition. The treatment of caries is to be conducted on the same prin- ciples as that of cancer, and consists in the use of means which have the effect either of destroying the life of the morbid part, or of removing it at once from the system. There is this differ- ence, however, that there being no malignant tendency to take on the same diseased action in the neighbouring parts, it is notPlilNOIPLBS OF SUllGEBY. 216 necessary to remove any of them, except in order to gain access to the seat of the evil. Notwithstanding this favourable circum- stance, it is found extremely difficult to eradicate the disease by depriving the part affected of its vitality. The bone usually lies at a considerable depth ; the caries, though it seldom penetrates deeply into its substance, generally occupies an extensive and irregular surface ; and the effect of agents used with the view of killing the morbid part is necessarily much weakened by its humidity. The concentrated mineral acids—^the nitrates of sHver and mercury—^the red oxide of mercury—and the actual cautery, are considered the best means for the purpose. In using them the bone affected ought to be very freely exposed by a crucial incision, and then dried as well as possible, after which the caustic or cautery selected should be applied so as to produce a decided effect. The fluid caustics should be applied by means of a piece of lint soaked in them; the solid ones should be rubbed on the part, or, if they are in the form of a powder, as the red oxide of mercury, laid on it in substance ; the cautery should be of a spherical or ovate shape, it must be pressed down firmly, and be succeeded by two or three others until the whole morbid surface has been subjected completely to their action. The effect of all these applications, however carefully employed, is very superficial, and it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to insure their operation on the whole surface of the diseased part. They, therefore, frequently require to be repeated, and generally prove inadequate to destroy the disease, unless it is very limited and accessible ; and it is even not improbable that some of them, as the actxial cautery, may occasionally make .the matter worse, and extend the disease to the neighbouring bone by exciting inflammation in it. For these reasons excision ought to be preferred to caustics for removing the carious bone ; and if the part affected be within reach, which can always be ascertained previous to commencing the operation, it may by this method be surely and thoroughly eradicated at once. If the disease is superficial, and of smaU extent, it is easily scooped out with a gouge, the toughness and compactness of the sound boneBONES. 217 clistiuguishing it from the morloid portion. If extensive and deeply seated, it is best removed by taking away the whole of the articulating extremities concerned, as will be explained here- after when the diseases of the joints are considered. When the situation of the caries prevents it from being cut out, amputa- tion ought, if possible, to be performed ; and if this be imprac- ticable, the disease will sooner or later prove inevitably fatal. Exostosis. The term Exostosis is employed to denote various morbid conditions of the osseous system differing materially from each other, and has consequently occasioned great confusion. In order to avoid this, it ought to be coniined in its meaning to imply an tmnatural growth of bone. Exostosis in this sense ex- hibits three remarkable varieties in respect of its structure; being sometimes solid, at other times hollow, and also not unfrequently spicular or foliated—that is, composed of radiating points or plates. The first of these lands of exostosis exists independently of any other disease, but the two others are connected with, and dependent upon, different morbid formations, along with which they may more properly be considered. The first, which may be called the simple or solid exostosis, consists of a mass of osseous substance growing out of a bone naturally belonging to the skeleton. It is sometimes thin and flat, rising gradually from the surrounding surface, and not caus- ing any sharp projection, when it is named a Node—an appella- tion which is also used to designate a similar swelling dependent on chronic thickening of the periosteum. In other cases it forms a projecting excrescence, the neck of which is usually narrow in proportion to the extremity. The substance composing such ex- crescences is of various solidity, being sometimes open and spongy, at others more dense and compact. The bones most frequently thus affected are the femur, tibia, humerus, and distal phalanx of the great toe. It may appear at any age, but, for the most part, does so about the time of puberty. The inconvenience which this sort of exostosis occasionsPllINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 218 depends very much upon its situation. Generally wMle the growtli is enlarging, pain and annoyance are experienced from obstructed function of the neighbouring parts; but when it ceases to increase and becomes dense, which it usually does sooner or later, the irritation of its presence becoming habitual, is no longer troublesome. The treatment, therefore, seldom requires to be active; and nothing more is usually requisite than to protect the limb, or part affected, from the irritation of motion or pressure, so long as the exostosis is enlarging. Should it prove permanently or seriously troublesome, excision affords easy and effectual means of relief. For this purpose many ingenious contrivances have been recommended, but nothing answers so well as the cutting-pliers. It has been thought necessary to perform amputation of the great toe on account of the exostoses which are apt to grow at the side or extremity of the nail; but this proceeding is equally severe and unnecessarj'-, as excision of the tumour may be easily effected, and is not fol- lowed by relapse. The reason of this appears to be that the ossifying process proceeds not from the root but from the surface of the growth—which is covered by a layer of fibro-cartilage or cartilaginous substance, and in some situations with the addition of an investing bag, like the synovial membrane. This condition greatly facilitates removal, by insulating the exostosis from sur- rounding paiis, and affording access to its point of attachment. It also occasionally embarrasses the diagnosis by becoming the seat of serous effusion. The hollow exostosis depends on the expansive effect of fluid or solid formations within the bone ; and the osseous substance may be regarded as devoid of any morbid disposition, so that if the contents could be removed it would contract to its ordinary dimensions. The same observations apply to the spicular or foliated exostosis, which is always found connected with some source of irritation, and is to be looked upon rather as a conse- quence than a part of the disease.219 BONES. Fih'o-Cartilaginous Tumour of Bone. It is usual to compreliend all the solid tumours of bone, tlie consistence of which is less hard than that of the bone itself, under the title of Osteo-sarcoma. But as this leads to much con- fusion, it is better to divide the softer tumours of bone into the fibro-cartilaginous, and meduUary-sarcomatous, which differ essentially in their nature and consequences. The fibro-cartilaginous tumour, when occurring in bones, possesses the characters which have been already described in the general account of this kind of morbid growth. Its colour is white, gray, or yellow; its consistence more or less nearly approaches that of cartUage, and it often has interspersed through it small cysts of transparent fluid. It generally originates in the central part of the bone affected, and gradually enlarging, expands the surrounding shell, which still preserves the pro- perties of sound osseous tissue, though sometimes singularly altered in shape. The tumour is productive of little inconveni- ence except from its size, but on this account is often a source of great annoyance and distress ; as when the lower-jaw, humerus, metacarpal bones, or phalanges of the fingers are affected. There is reason to believe, that if the fibro-cartilaginous substance could be completely eradicated, the bone would resume its natural shape and size; but as its cellular or honeycomb-looking structure, when expanded by the disease, renders this impractic- able, the only remedy is removal of the bone affected, which, however disagreeable in some situations, from the deformity occasioned by it, may at least be performed with a favourable prospect of effecting a permanent cure. Medullary-Sarcomatous Tumour of Bone. MeduUary sarcoma occurs in bone perhaps more frequently than in any other tissue of the body. It commences sometimes immediately under the periosteum, and causes an excavation in the surface of the bone, around which more or less osseous matter is effused; at other times it begins in the interior,220 I'lUNCIPLES OF SUEGERY. springing apparently from the medullary membrane, and then expands the bone into a sheU, or, by inducing absorption, causes a perforation, through which it issues and swells into an external tumour ; or it opens out the bone into needles or plate-like pro- cesses radiating from the central seat of the disease; or lastly, it may simply occupy the place of the bone. But, whatever may be the diversity in this respect, the morbid degeneration always exhibits its characteristic features. There is usually great pain from the first, and often for a long while, before any external swelling is visible. The patient loses flesh, and indicates, by his anxious expression of countenance, the presence of a malignant disease. The tumour, though at first seldom so soft as when originating in the less dense tissues of the body, in its progress becomes softened, and acquires, at least in some parts of its extent, a consistence so nearly approaching that of a fluid, as to render the discrimination from it, extremely difficult. Then the veins enlarge—the integuments inflame—ulceration ensues— fungous excrescences protrude—and the patient sinks under the exhaustion which results from profuse discharge of ill-condi- tioned matter or blood. The disease makes its attack at every time of life, and in both sexes; but seems, on the whole, most frequent between twenty and forty years of age. The only remedy is amputation; and unless this be performed early, before the constitution of the patient is much injured, and freely, so as to remove the whole of the affected bone, it will in all probability prove of little permanent benefit. Cystic Tumour of Bone. The bones sometimes, but very rarely, with exception of the upper and lower jaw, become the seat of cystic formations. The swelling is generally not attended with much pain, and at its commencement may be mistaken for a solid exostosis or cartila- ginous growth; but as the cysts enlarge and approach the surface, the thinness of their parietes betrays the nature of the case. This disease occurs most frequently in the earlier periods of adult age. So long as it retains the characters221 BONES. of the cystic tumour, it may be regarded as free from any malig- nant action; but tbis morbid structure sometimes changes into medullary sarcoma. The best mode of treatment is early and free removal of the bone affected, if puncturing the tumour, or laying it open by free incision, has not the effect of curing the disease. Rachitis or Rickets. By Rickets is imderstood a morbid state of the osseous system, in which the bones are soft and flexible, being converted into a substance more like leather than bone; having a brown colour and cartilaginous consistence, with no appearance of marrow, but numerous irregularly circular and oval cells, even in the parts naturally most compact, contaming a brownish-red fluid. The disease does not directly cause pain, but occasions great inconvenience by allowing the bones to bend under the weight of the body, and contraction of the muscles. It is accompanied with weakness and derangement of the whole system, the symptoms of which are a pale and sickly counten- ance, tumid abdomen, flabbiness of the miiscles, and unhealthy evacuations. The earliest perceptible alteration of the bones is at the wrists, where the extremities of the radius and iilna be- come preternaturally large, and are apt to excite the suspicion of fracture. It is confined to the period of childhood, and seldom begins later than the second or third year of age. It affects chiefly the offspring of young or unhealthy parents, and occurs most frecLuently in cold moist climates. It terminates either in death or in a return to health, after months or years of duration. Contrary to what might be expected, rickety bones are readily broken by slight degrees of violence, and their re- paration in such cases is effected chiefly by cartilage. Wlaen the bones regain their healthy nutritive action, they become as hard and unyielding as usual, retaining, however, the curva- tures which have taken place during the softened state. The new osseoi;s substance which is deposited during their subse- quent growth, occupies chiefly the concave side of the arches into which they are bent, where it has most effect in strengtheningPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 222 their power of resistance, and thus gives them a remarkable flattened shape. Eickets used to be ascribed to the operation of a morbid acid humour pervading the system, and the remedy consequently con- sisted in liberally supplying the patient with alkaline and earthy preparations, in order to neutralize this acidity, and replace the defective earth of the bones, which was supposed to have been removed by its chemical agency. The disease is now referred, more consistently with scientific pathology, simply to disorder of the nutritive action of the osseous tissue, and the means em- ployed to correct it are merely those which tend to strengthen the system in general, while eveiy prudent precaution is taken to prevent the bones from suffering distortion, so long as they remain exposed to it by theu- softness and flexibility. With these objects in view, the patient ought to be frequently put into a warm bath, and every day have the whole surface of the body subjected to friction. He shoidd be warmly clothed, and, if possible, removed to a dry situation sheltered from the cold. His diet must be moderate, easily digestible, and nourish- ing ; and he should abstain from all medicine, except what is required to maintain or excite the intestinal secretions. While the bones are in a yielding state, exercise in the erect posture may cause curvature and distortion, especially of the bones com- posing the trunk and inferior extremities; the patient ought, therefore, to be debarred from walking, running, etc., and encouraged to creep and roll upon the floor or on the ground in the open air. Should the limbs unfortunately have been bent through neglect or injudicious treatment, they may often be straightened by the gentle and continued use of splints or other apparatus. Mollities and Fragilitas Ossiim. By Mollities Ossium or Malacosteon is understood a general disease of the bones, in which they become extremely soft, much more so than in rickets, so that in its advanced stages there hardly remains any trace of the osseous texture, and the perios-223 BONES. teum encloses merely a yellow or brownish mass of lardy con- sistence. This affection is attended with excessive and almost incessant pain—is almost confined to females—occurs chiefly at the middle period of life—and though often veiy slow in its progress, advances until the patient dies. There is no effectual remedy for this malady, and its treat- ment consists in the use of means proper for palliating the patient's sufferings, of which the different preparations of opium are the best, and supporting the general health, for which pur- pose sea air seems to have most influence. Fragility or unusual facility for being broken, naturally leads to the idea of a redundance in the earthy constituent of bones ; and a certain degree of it depending on this cause is observed in old people; but the condition which is generally understood to be denoted by this title, and in which the proneness to breaking is so great that fracture is caused by the slightest external vio- lence, or even by the action of the muscles in effecting the ordi- nary movements of the limbs, is a state of preternatural softness instead of increased density. Eickets, malacosteon, and the medullary-sarcomatous degeneration, all occasionally render the bones more liable to be broken ; and fracture being sometimes the first obvious effect of the diseased action, is not only thought to be the cause that induced it, but also chosen as the character- istic feature for its designation. A remarkable degree of fragility has been observed in the advanced stage of carcinomatous disease. Diseases of the Spine. ■ There are two morbid states of the spinal column wliich occur so frequently, and are attended with such important effects on the system, that they require to be considered by themselves. These are inflammation, and some of its consequences, with or without curvature, and curvature without inflammation. AVhen inflammation occurs in the vertebrae, it is seated in their bodies and intermediate cartUages, and is indicated first by a dull gnawing pain at the part, which is aggravated by pressure and motion; then a slight degree of swelling generally appearsPRINCIPLES OF SUEGEHY. 224 SO as to make the spinous processes of the affected vertebr£e ap- pear more projecting than usual; the patient loses his appetite and strength; becoming dull and listless, and preferring the . horizontal posture ; his inferior extremities are reduced in bulk, and affected with numbness and rigidity; whence the gait is awkward and vacillating, the legs frequently crossing each other, while the trunk is held peculiarly erect and rigid, to protect the \ diseased part from motion. As the disease advances, the patient 1 sometimes loses the use of his limbs entirely; and, in addition I to his other complaints, is generally distressed by an uneasy jfeehng at the pit of his stomach, and a painful sense of constric- •tion round the chest, in the region of the diaphragm. Suppura- tion usually ensues, and the matter is either confined to the neighbourhood of the bone affected, or descends in the interstices of the soft parts so as to present itself lower down. When the dorsal vertebrte are affected, it generally points in the loins, and constitutes a lumbar abscess; when the lower dorsal or the lumbar vertebrae , are concerned, it for the most part passes down along the p^o^s muscle, and appears in the groin, sometimes above, but more frequently below, Poupart's ligament, when it is named a psoas abscess. The matter, in order to point above Poupart's ligament, must perforate the abdominal muscles and fascine, through means of absorption, which happens generally by a small aperture ; the pus thus comes to be quite superficial, and diffused under the sldn, from which circumstance the abscess may be erroneously regarded as entirely subcutaneous. It must be ob- served, that though chronic abscesses in the loins or groin most frequently proceed from diseased bone, they may exist independ- ently of such sources, just as in other parts of the body. When the pus ceases to be confined near the bone, and begins to drain away from it, the patient generally experiences great relief from his complaints. The pain becomes very much less- ened, and the use of his limbs is often in some measure or alto- gether regained. But this amendment is usually accompanied by a serious change to the worse in another respect; since the vertebral column is apt to bend under its superincumbent weight,BONES. 225 when weakened by the destruction of bone and intervertebral cartilage which attends the suppuration. The curvature in this case takes place forwards, and being confined to a small extent of jthe spine, causes an acute projection behind, so that one or more jof the spinous processes appear to be dislocated backwards. This {change of shape does not take place, either when the extent of the disease is small in proportion to the size of the bones in which it is seated, or when it is so great that the patient is con- stantly confined to the horizontal posture; but these ckcum- stances are comparatively rare in proportion to those which favour the occurrence of curvature. If the morbid action ceases before suppuration, the bones affected unite with a degree of approximation proportioned to the amount of absorption which they have sufiered ; and if suppuration does take place, the sur- face of the abscess either heals with approximation and consoli- dation of its parietes—^the vertebree concerned appearing as if run into one mass—or a state of caries remains, and gradually wears out the patient's strength. This disease may occur at any period of life, but is by far C^' most common in children from two to eight years of age. In adults it generally occupies a small part of the bone, and proves extremely obstinate, or rather always incurable, at least with such few exceptions as hardly deserve to be mentioned. In childhood it usually engages the whole substance of two or three adjoining bodies of the vertebrae, which on dissection are found almost entirely wasted away, together with the intervertebral . substance, portions of dead bone and pus occupying the cavity. The disease is usually ascribed to twists or blows; but as these injuries are seldom thought of until long after they are alleged to have been received, and not before the symptoms attract attention, there is some reason to discredit their effect in exciting the morbid action. In children there is reason to believe that the first step of the morbid process is usually the deposition of scrofulous substance. It would seem that in adults the disease is liable to be excited by sexual excesses. In conducting the treatment of this acute curvature, as it is Q226 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. generally named, surgeons proceeded formerly in the belief that the primary evil consisted in displacement of one or more of the vertebra from violence; that the pain and loss of voluntary motion depended on pressure caused by the dislocated parts on the spinal marrow; and that the disease of the bones was not only caused, but kept up by, the irritation proceeding from their unnatural position. The practice, therefore, consisted in the use of mechanical contrivances for rectifying the displacement. Tlie inef&cacy and danger of such a mode of proceeding must be obvious to every one acquainted with the true condition of the bones, which having their substance destroyed more or less ex- tensively, though separable by force, must resume their situation as soon as it is removed. And if the vertebrte are much weak- ened, or partially united, they will be very apt to suffer such fracture or disjunction as may render the limbs below perma- nently paralytic, or prove immediately fatal. Mr. Pott, observing that curvature of the spine from rickets, though productive of the most extreme distortion and deformity, was not attended with palsy; and that the palsy accompanying the disease in question did not resemble the state which is in- duced by pressure on the spinal marrow, the muscles of the limbs being not soft and flaccid, but rigid and tense, concluded that the curvature was an effect, and not the cause, of the disease, which he thought might more reasonably be referred to inflam- mation seated in the bodies of the vertebrae, and causing more or less irritation of the neighbouring spinal marrow. With this view of the matter he used counter-irritation by means of issues opened with caustic potash, as early as possible, in order to subdue the inflammatory action, and interdicted the erect postui'e, as increasing the irritation. Mechanical contri- vances do not afford the diseased spine nearly the same repose which is obtained from the horizontal posture, and frequently occasion the greatest mischief, by pressing injuriously on different parts of the trunk, as well as by inducing the patient to indulge in exercises which the diseased spine cannot bear with impunity. There can be no doubt as to the soundness of the principle whichBONES. 227 constitutes the foundation of Mr. Pott's practice ; but it certainly has been applied too indiscriminately. In the common case which commences with scrofulous deposition in the substance, or on the surface of the bones, and insidiously advances through its suppurative stage, noadl^^.^^S® ^® derived from counter- irritation, which, on the contrary, may prove injurious by exhaust- ing the^atient's strength. In the case also, occasionally, though not so frequently met with, where the spine forms an acute pro- jection posteriorly, becoming bent almost to a right angle, with little pain and no suppuration,—the bodies of the vertebr£e seem- ing to be simply absorbed, so that the remaining rings and pro- cesses are consolidated together,—there is no use in opening issues. It is only when the pain and other symj)toms that have \ been mentioned denote the existence of inflammatory action, that caustic or the actual cautery should be employed. The latter agent seems greatly preferable, and is to be applied longi- tudinally to the extent of a few inches on each side of the affected part, except when the neck is concerned, in which case the'middle line may be selected for the purpose. This disease occasionally affects the first or second upper cervical vertebra, with the corresponding part of the occipital bone. The symptoms, in the first instance, are the same as those wliich have been already described, consisting of deep-seated pain felt chiefly at night, and aggravated by motion. But, owing to the importance of the portion of the nervous system which lies within the direct influence of the disease, when it is thus situated, namely, the lower part of the medulla oUongata, and the mobility of the joints concerned, the patient's sufferings are extremely severe. In eating and speaking he feels darting pains through the neck. In changing his position, he keeps the \ head perfectly steady, and employs both his hands to assist the i muscles in preventing any rotation or flexion of the affected vertebrse. He loses his appetite and strength; complains of ! almost unremitting and intolerable nausea; and exhibits, by a peculiarly anxious and unhappy expression of countenance, that he labours under a disease of the most agonizing kind. Loss ofPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 228 voice, difficulty of breathing, convulsions, and palsy, occasionally supervene ; the head generally suffers more or less distortion to one side, in' consequence of the bone giving way under the ulcerative process; and at length, after months or years of misery, the patient dies, either gradually, from mere exhaustion, or sud- denly, from dislocation of the odontoid process of the second vertebra, which becoming detached from the occipital bone, presses backwards on the medulla oUongata. If an abscess forms, it is seldom evacuated previously to the patient's death, and sometimes opens into the pharynx. The subjects of this disease are mostly children and yoimg adults. The treatment requires rest of the head, together with counter-irritation, effected early and powerfully by the actual cautery; and practitioners ought to beware of mistaking the first indications of this destructive disease for slight rheumatic \ailments deserving of no particular attention. The preparations . 'in museums prove that the cure of the disease, though perhaps jvery rare, is not impossible. The other disease of the spine which requires to be particu- larly considered, on account, not of its danger to life, but its frequency and important consequences in respect to the patient s appearance and comfort, consists merely in curvature, without any sj)ecific or general morbid affection of the osseous system. It is named the Lateral curvature; its direction being very rarely from behind forwards, and almost invariably from side to side. It occurs chiefly between the ages of seven and seventeen; and, with few exceptions, is confined to the female sex. It generally comes on insidiously, increases progressively, and, terminating at a more or less advanced stage, leaves the patient permanently disfigured in a proportionate degree. The part of the spine principally affected is the dorsal portion, which, bending to one side, almost always to the right one, makes the corresponding scapula and shoulder seem larger and more prominent than usual. As the disease advances, a counter-balancing bend in the opposite direction takes place in the lumbar region, causing the hip concerned to appear enlarged. When the spinous pro-BONES. 229 cesses are traced downwards from the neck to the sacrum, the alternate bending in their course may be readily observed. As the curvature continues to increase, the distortion becomes more and more apparent;—the trunk is shortened and compressed;— the ribs are approximated from side to side, and protruded for- wai-ds to increase the capacity of the contracted thorax, which thus has its shape entirely altered, and is widest from before backwards. However far the disease may proceed, the limbs and pelvis remain free from any participation in it. In ascertaining the cause and nature of this curvature, the following circumstances which attend its commencement must be carefully recollected:—1. It occurs almost exclusively in females who devote a large proportion of their time, duriiig the period when the morbid disposition exists, to the pursuits usually followed in imdergoing a fashionable education, or to some sedentary occupation, which does not require or permit much bodily exertion. 2. It usually affects most seriously those indi- viduals who possess a slender frame, or one characterised by indications of a phlegmatic temperament,—their bodies, though thick and bulky, being pale, flabby, and prone to all the morbid states, depending on weakness of action. 3. Other things being equal, it occurs most certainly, and proceeds most rapidly, when the trunk is habitually maintained in a bent position. The predisposition to the disease, therefore, appears to be // constitutional weakness, and its exciting causes, circumstances I which increase the weakness of the spine particularly, and/ promote its bending by the figure they make it assume. The! strength of the spine depends partly upon the bones, and partly' upon the muscles composing it; and it is probable that the former are chiefly affected by the predisposition, while the latter are influenced more by the exciting causes. All muscles require frequent exercise for the preservation of their strength; but, during the occupations of drawing, playing, sewing, etc., while the extremities are either constantly employed, or, at all events, unrestrained in their movements, the trunk is not only held perfectly steady in one position, often a curved one, but is also230 PIUNCIPLES OF SURGEHY. compressed with the rigid articles of dress wliich are used under the erroneous expectation of improving the shape. The muscles of the hack, therefore, becoming extremely weak, and, indeed, as may be learned by actual examination, almost com- pletely absorbed, are no longer able without an effort to restore the erect position of the spine when bent by the weight of the head and superior extremities, or by the occupation of the patient. It is consequently allowed to assume a permanent curve; and then the predisposition, which depends on a softened state of the bone, acts with full effect; because the more the column bends, the longer levers are afforded to the superincumbent pressure. As the distortion increases, the viscera of the thorax and abdomen are more and more, compressed and displaced, their functions suffer corresponding derangement, and the whole system becoming disordered, the bones, even less properly nourished than before, lose still more of their resisting power. Should the patient unfortunately, during this prociess, fall into the hands of a machine-maker, who attempts to prop up the weak and twisted spine by means of iron frameworks, the morbid alterations which have been described will be accelerated ; for all such contrivances must prove either insupportable to the patient, or inefficient in straightening the spine; and granting even that they could accomplish this, they would still labour under the great objection of confining the movements of the trimk, and preventing the muscles from obtaining 'that exercise which is essential to the recovery of their strength. The result would be not more satis- factory if the practitioner were to go to the opposite extreme, and, regarding the muscles as the sole seat of the disease, attempt to strengthen them by enjoining exercise in the erect posture, or, still worse,, recommending a weight to be carried on the head, in order to render their actions in balancing it more energetic than usual. Such means, however useful in preventing curvature, must manifestly tend to increase it when once commenced. In the management of persons predisposed by their age, sex, temperament, or constitutional make, to this disease, every means ought to be used for strengthening the system in general, andBONES. 231 the,trunk in particular. All long-continued and constrained positions must be interdicted,—frequent exercise of such kind as calls into action the muscles of the trunk should be enjoined. The use of stays, corsets, and every rigid article of dress, howeyer designated, must be strictly prohibited. If curvature has already taken place, it is evident that the first step towards reparation must be relieving the weak and bent spine from pressure. The only mode of effectually accomplishing this is to make the | patient assume the horizontal posture, which can be done with- [ out any great hardship, if a smooth well-stufiPed sofa is provided, f instead of the floor or a board, which is sometimes used for the purpose. When the curvature begins to diminish, the patient may rise occasionally for a few minutes, and exercise the muscles by some suitable employment, which ought never to be continued after the slightest feeling of fatigue is experienced. By persist- ing in this system, the disease will certainly be arrested in its course; the distortion, if not very great, will be removed; and the worst cases will be considerably improved.232 l-mNCIPLKS OF SUEGEIIY. CHAPTEE XII. JOINTS. Sprains and Bmises. The ligamentous tissue is not productive of pain excited by the ordinary stimuli whicli occasion it in other parts ; but though insensible to cutting and tearing, it suffers severely from being overstretched, in conformity with the general law, that the sen- sibility of parts bears some relation to their use in the animal economy. The articular cartilages and hniag synovial mem- brane again suffer from violent compression. The symptoms and effects, primaiy as well as secondary, which proceed from these two sources, are very similar. Joints of the ginglymoid or hinge-like structure, and those of the arthi'odia Idud, such as the tarsal and carpal articulations, are exposed to the first-men- tioned injury, while the ball-and-socket joints, though nearly exempt from it, are subject to bruises from their respective sur- faces being squeezed together. Both strains, or sprains as they are called, and bruises are attended in the first instance with severe sickening pain, and more or less complete inability of using the joint. To these symptoms succeed .swelling, tension, and, if the joint is super- ficial, discoloration from ecchymosis, and not unfrequently in- flammation, particularly if the patient possesses a scrofulous or otherwise irritable constitution. The inflammation, when chronic, leads to thickening and adhesions of the articular apparatus, which occasiofi deformity and lameness, or morbid degenerations of the same part, which frequently end in the destruction of the joint; when acute, it tends to sxijipuration. The immediate effects of these injuries are always distressing, and their secondaryJOINTS. 233 consequences, though not certainly serious, are generally incon- venient, and often destructive of the limb. Such accidents, therefore, ought always to be treated with attention, so that nothing may be neglected in any way calculated to guard against bad consequences to the joint. The means that afford most relief from the pain directly caused by the injury, consist in the application of hot fomenta- tions and the preservation of perfect rest. Tlie ecchymosis is often considered a warrant for leeching or cupping; but, as has been already explained, the blood which produces the discolora- tion, being effused from the vessels, cannot be' withdrawn in either of these ways, and must be removed by absorption. If symptoms of inflammation come on, blood should be extracted freely, and the other means employed that will be .mentioned when the inflammation of joints is considered. After the injured part has ceased to be painful on pressure or motion, and remains merely swelled and stiff, it ought to be supported by a bandage, and at the same time have some stimulating ointment or lotion applied to promote absorption. Blistering, warm pumping, the vapour-bath, friction, and gentle but frequently repeated exer- cise, are useful at the same time, and witb the same view. Dislocation. By Dislocation is understood displacement of the respective surfaces of an articnlation. The dislocation may be partial or complete ; and also simple or compound, in the same sense of these terms as when they are used with reference to fractures. It is simple dislocations only which will be considered under this section, as those which are compound may be arranged more con- veniently imder wounds of the joints. The joints least subject to strains are most readily dislocated, since the mobility and freedom of ligamentous connection which protect them from the former injury expose them to the latter. The circumstance of having been formerly dislocated increases the predisposition. The causes Of dislocation are—1. external violence ; 2. inordinate muscular action ; and 3. diseased altera-PltlNQlPLES OF SUllGERY. 234 tion of the articular apparatus. The displacements which pro- ceed from the last of these causes are named spontaneous dislocations, and will be considered along with the diseases which give rise to them. The process of dislocation usually consists of two stages or acts ; there being first the displacement of the articulating sur- faces, which results directly from the violence that causes the accident; and then a further separation of them by the action of the muscles which formerly held the bones together, but now pull them past each other. These two steps are sometimes de- signated by the names of primary and secondary dislocation. Of the symptoms of dislocation, the most constant and charac- teristic one, .especially as a distinction from fracture, is inamo- bility or fixture, when motion of the limb is attempted either by means of its own muscles or by an external force, which depends upon the unnatural position of the articulating extremities of the bones, and the contraction of their surrounding muscles. The limb is generally shortened, but sometimes it is lengthened, and when the latter is the case there cannot of course be any sus- picion of fracture. There are also attending the accident defor- mity from the altered situation of the bones, pain or numbness from their pressure on the muscles and nerves, and swelling with coldness from obstruction of the blood-vessels. The treatment of dislocation consists in reducing or replacing the articular surface which has been moved from its proper posi- tion ; in doing which it is necessary to counteract the forces that caused the two acts of removal This is effected by first extend- ing the limb, so as to draw back the bone to the point where the muscles began to operate in producing its displacement; and then urging it in a direction opposite to that in which the external violence primarily acted. These steps in the j)rocess of reduction, which are named extension and coaptation, have sometimes an equal share in its accomplishment, but more fre- quently one or other of them is chiefly useful. In ball or socket- joints the first, and in hinge-joints the second, is chiefly used. The dislocated bone ought generally to l;)e extended in theJOINTS. 235 dii-ection which it has assiuned in consequence of the displace- ment. The force for this purpose may be applied so as to act either directly on the hone itself, or on a part of the limb sepa- rated from it by one or more articulations. It has been objected to the former mode, that it causes compression of the muscles opposed to reduction, and to the latter, that, by keeping the limb straight, it is still more adverse to yielding of the muscles. It does not appear, however, that any practical inconvenience is experienced in either of these ways. The former method is on tlie whole more convenient in most cases, and is generally employed in this country. In order to make extension effec- tually, it is necessary to have counter-extension exerted on the corresponding surface from which the bone has been dislocated —^viz., the one nearest the centre of the body; and the more directly it is subjected to the power employed for this pur^jose, the more perfectly will the object in view be attained. The force employed for extension may be either simply the manual strength of one or more stout assistants, or this increased by the power of the pulley. In all cases of recent dislocation, excexDt perhaps sometimes when the hip-joiat is concerned, mere manual extension is sufficient, and it ought, therefore, in general, to be preferred, being more readily obtained, and also more easily managed, than the pulley. The best bandage for applying the extending force is a skein of worsted, or a folded shawl, which must be securely fastened to prevent it from slipping in the pro- cess. The best noose for this purpose is either the clove-hitch, as it is called by sailors, or another which is preferred by the , French surgeons. It is executed by placing the band across the limb in a triple form, and then drawing each of its ends through the opposite loop. The strength of the patient's muscles used to be weakened by bleeding—the warm bath—tobacco injections—and the tartrate of antimony, given in solution in small doses frequently repeated. The involuntary resistance was also lessened by making tlie patient speak, so as to prevent fixture of tlie thorax, which being the central point of attachment directly or indirectly to all thePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 236 muscles of the body, is instinctively rendered immovable when- ever any strong effort is to be made. With a similar view it is sometimes advantageous to effect the extension suddenly, when it is not expected by the patient; but unless it should seem practicable to accomplish the reduction in this way instan- taneously, the limb ought to be extended slowly and steadily, since the effect of the stretching force in subduing the contrac- tile energy of the muscles depends more upon its duration than its degree. The introduction of chloroform has superseded the use of all other subsidiary means, and, by completely suspend- ing muscular contraction, wonderfully facilitated the process of reduction. Coaptation is more or less required according to the resist- ance which is opposed to the reduction by the shape and situa- tion of the articular surfaces. As has been already remarked, it is generally least usefiil in the ball-and-socket joints, and of most advantage in those of the hinge form. In the former, it is sometimes not required at all; and in the latter, it is occasionally sufficient of itself to accomplish the operation. After the dislocation is reduced, the joint ought to be pro- tected against the operation of those circumstances which tend to renew the injury. It ought to be kept perfectly quiet, and frequently fomented, to allay the pain and initatiou consequent on the laceration and bruising of the various injured parts. It might be expected that the immediate pain as well as the danger of consecutive inflammation, woiild be greater in dislocation where the ligaments are torn, than in strains, where they are only overstretched. But this is not the case, and though inflam- mation, both acute and chronic, may no doubt result from the former accident, it is seldom followed by any serious bad con- sequences of this kind. Wlien the dislocation is not reduced, the bone acquires adhesions to the neighboui-iiig parts round the margin of its articular surface, and by its pressure induces absoi-ption of the surface it comes to act on, so that a cavity is formed for its reception, and a sort of new joint produced, which enables theJOINTS. 237 patient to regain considerable use of tlie limb. While this process is going on, the old articular hollow gradually contracts, and iiltimately becomes obliterated ; so that, if the bone were displaced from its new situation, it could not be returned to its original one. The time that may elapse before reduction becomes impracticable, varies with the age of the patient and the nature of the joint concerned, from two or three weeks to as many months. It is longer in old people than in young, and in dislo- cations of ball-and-socket joints than in those of hinge-joints. Slioulder-joint.—The head of the humerus may be dislocated downwards, forwards, and backwards. The first of these dis- placements is the most common, and happens more frequently than the dislocation of any other joint. The accident is caused by external violence proceeding from falls on the hand or elbow, or blows on the shoulder, while the arm is separated from the side, and also, though rarely, by sudden violent contractions of the pectoralis major and laiissimus darsi, while the limb is in a state of abduction. In some rare cases it has been observed to occur during an epileptic convulsion. The capsular ligament is necessarily torn, and the head of the bone rests upon the neck of the scapula over the origin of the long head of the triceps. The sjinptoms are elongation of the arm, which is stiff and powerless, projecting considerably from the side, and slightly bent, both the biceps and triceps being put upon the stretch. The tension of the former muscle generally occasions supination of the fore-arm ; the axOlary hoUow is occupied by the head of the humerus ; and imder the acromion there is a remarkable • depression instead of the usual convexity of the deltoid, from the absence of the bone. There is pain of the shoulder, numbness of the fingers, and more or less swelling of the whole Hmb. The reduction may be effected by various methods, but the one which will generally be found most convenient, is to place the heel of the operator in the axilla of the patient, while both lie horizontally in opposite directions; then perform extension by pulling the hand of the affected arm; and finally effect coap- tation by bending the limb inwards over the ftilcrum which isPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 238 afforded by the foot. The great efficiency of this method depends upon the direction of the extending force, which is not opposed to the action of the pectoralis major and latissiinus dorsi, as when the limb is drawn outwards at a right angle to the chest. In every case which proves difficult, or is expected to be so, from the duration of the displacement, extension should be made downwards, or in the longitudinal direction of the body, either by pulling with the heel in the axilla, or by employing the strength of assistants, aided, if necessary, by the pulley, to draw the arm in this direction, while counter-extension is effected by a cushion secured in the axilla by a strap passing round the shoulders, and secured to a wall or other firm support. In tliis way dislocations of several weeks' standing may be readUy reduced ; and even at the end of six or seven, success need not be despaired of; but beyond this period, notwithstanding occasional instances of success, the case in general must be regarded nearly hopeless. In dislocation of the humerus forwards, the head of the bone lies on the sternal side of the coracoid process, a position into which it can get only by suffering a- secondary displacement after having been forced downwards. The muscles then draw it upwards and inwards, as far as the clavicle allows. In this case the limb is rather shortened. The elbow is bent and in the state of abduction, owing to the position of the head of the humerus, and, from the same cause, there is less numTjness and sweUing of the limb. There is not so much perceptible de- pression imder the acromion, and the axilla is not so completely occupied as when it contains the head of the bone. As might be expected from the negative character of these symptoms, the diagnosis is not so easy as that of dislocation downwards; and hence practitioners who are not sufficiently careful frequently overlook the nature of the accident. Tlie reduction should be performed as in the former case ; but it is here still more advantageous to extend downwards, in order to dislodge the bone from the position into which it is drawn by the muscles.239 JOINTS. Dislocation of the humerus backwards or outwards is very, rare. In the few cases of it which have been observed, the head of the bone lay between the scapula and infra-spinatus muscles, below the spine, so as to cause a distinct external swelling in this situation, and a deficiency at the fore part of the shoulder. The arm was directed forwards across the chest, and could not be moved into any other position without both force and pain. The reduction is easily effected, the extension being made in the direction which the limb retains from the accident. In all very recent cases of dislocation of the shoulder, and more especially within an hour or two after the accident, there is- a considerable chance of effecting reduction by suddenly rotating the arm outwards, and at the same time drawing the elbow backwards, while the operator's hand in the axilla urges the head of the bone into its place. In such circumstances, therefore, this simple method ought always to be tried in the first instance,—of course without any intimation to the patient of the intention to do so, which would certainly excite opposing action of his muscles. Elboio-joint.—The elbow-joint is liable to various sorts of dislocation, the diagnosis of which is often very difficult, especially as fractures near or through the articular surfaces pro- duce in some respects similar symptoms. There is a difference of opinion as to the comparative frequency of these accidents, and also as to the characters for distinguishing them, with the exception of one dislocation, which is certainly the most common and best marked of the whole. This is displacement of both . bones of the fore-arm backwards. The articulating extremity of the hiunerus stretches the biceps and hrachiceus iniernus, occa- sions a hard tumour at the bend of the arm, and generaUy causes permanent semiflexion of the limb, though, sometimes, as I have had occasion to see in several instances, the arm is straight. Tlie olecranon projects behind further than usual, and the triceps is much relaxed. The fore-arm appears shortened. This accident happens from falls on the hand while the arm is bent. The reduction is very easily performed by making extension,240 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. and then bending the fore-arm, while the surgeon, embracing the. elbow with his hands, so tliat the fingers rest on the olecranon, and the thumbs on the extremity of the humerus, pushes the displaced bones into their proper position. The radius is liable to be dislocated separately, and may be driven either forwards or backwards. In the latter case, the dis- placement is so obvious from the tumour which is caused by the head of the bone, that it can hardly be overlooked ; but in the former, which is the more common of the two, the nature of the accident is very apt to escape detection until it is too late to afford relief The symptoms are pain and swelling about the elbow, which is half-bent, and allows a slight degree of flexion and extension ; any attempt to increase the former being attended with a sudden snap or catch, owing to the head of the radius, which lies over the coronoid process of the ulna, strildng against the humerus. I have seen in one case the flexion continue quite free. The form of the fore-arm is altered, being round, instead of flat from side to side. "Wlaen the hand is rotated, the radius is felt rolling under the origin of the flexor muscles, and a cavity is perceived where its head ought to be. Both forms of this accident result either from direct violence sustained on the elbow, or from falls on the hand. The reduction is very easy if performed early, and requires merely that the hand should be extended while pressui'e is made on the head of the bone, and the elbow is bent. The extending force is made to act on the hand, in order to concen- trate it as much as possible on the radius; since, if acting on the ulna, which has not been displaced, it could not do any good. Lateral dislocations of the elbow are occasionally met with, and when examined early may in general be easily recognised by the alteration of shape and direction of mobility which attend them. The reduction is effected chiefly by coaptation, and is not difficult, unless the parts concerned have been allowed to become rigid and adherent. Wrist-joint.—The wrist often appears to be dislocated, owing to the swelling and immobility which it suffers in consequence241 JOINTS. of external injury, but these symptoms in the great majority of cases are merely the effects of sprains ; and real dislocation of the joint is an extremely rare occurrence. It may take place in two directions, forwards and backwards, the bones of the carpus being driven upwards under either the extensors or the flexors. The causes are faUs on the hand. The reduction is efiected by extending the hand, and pressing on the dislocated bones. Tlmmh.—The first or proximal phalanx of the thumb is occasionally dislocated from its connection with the metacarpal bone in consequence of falls or blows. It is driven upwards and baclcwards, where the extremity can be felt distinctly, while that of the metacarpal bone is not less perceptible on the palmar side. The reduction of this apparently trivial displacement has been generally found very difficult, and sometimes altogether impracticable, the reason of which would seem to be, that the lateral ligaments of the joint remain more or less entire, and being stretched by the wedge-shaped extremity of the metacai'pal bone in passing between them, afford.,a serious obstacle to its return. The best mode of proceeding is to extend the thumb with moderate force, and at the same time to exert strong pressure on the extremity of the phalanx in the proper direction for pushing it into its place. The operation, when thus performed, is some- times executed with great facility. In cases where the difficulty proves insuperable, one of the lateral ligaments may be cut, wliich would certainly be better than leaving the bone unreduced, as has sometimes been the case. A needle sharp on the edges, or a very small Imife, should be employed for this purpose, so as merely to puncture the skin. Fingers.—Both the proximal and distal, or .first and third phalanges of the fingers, are occasionally dislocated backwards, so that the displaced extremity rests on the dorsal surface of the corresponcling bone. The accident can hardly be overlooked or mistaken, and the reduction is generally very easy, provided the force employed be directed chiefly upon the projecting end of the phalanx.242 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. ^ Ilip-joint.—Tlie liip-joint, notwithstanding the great strength of all the parts which enter into its formation, is suhjeet to dis- location in four different directions:—1. Upwards and back- wards on the dorsum of the ilium, 2. Backwards into the sacro-ischiatic notch. 3. Downwards into the foramen ovale. And 4. Forwards upon the pubis. In dislocation upon the dorsum of the ilium the limb is shortened from one and a haK to two inches—the affected knee is bent over the sound one—and the foot is turned inwards so that the great toe of it rests on the tarsus of the other. The thigh cannot be moved except slightly inwards—the trochanter major is higher up, and nearer the crest of the ilium than usual —and the head of the bone can sometunes be felt rolling imder the muscles when the limb is moved. This accident happens from falls on the side, and tlie circmn- stance of having a load on the back promotes the dislocation by increasing the strain. It happens most frequently in males, and is seldom met with either in very young or in very old subjects, being in a great measure confined to those in the vigour of life. To effect reduction, the patient should be placed on a mattress upon his back. A folded sheet or tablecloth is then to be passed between the thighs, so as to support the perineum, its ends being either held in the hands of assistants standing bebuid the patient's head as he lies supine, or secured to a rmg in the waU. A skein of worsted, or any other suitable lac, is next fastened round the limb immediately above the knee, and committed to assistants, either trusting to their own strength for extending sufficiently, or aided by pulleys, if the case promise to prove difficult. The points of extension and counter-exteijsion having been thus determined, any degree of obliquity that seems requisite may be easily given to the former by turning round the mattress *a little, until it appears that the Hmb is extended exactly in the line which it has assumed from the dislocation. It is usual to rotate the leg, and at the same time use means for drawing the neck of the thigh-bone outwards so as to lift its head over the edge of the acetabulum; but from my ownJOINTS. 213 opportuuities of observation, I am led to believe tliat any sncli interference is quite unnecessary, since tlie extension, if suf- ficiently powerful and properly directed, completely attains the object, as the muscles generally pull the head of the bone into its place when it has been carried far enough; but if it should seem that the margin of the acetabulum opposes any resistance to its return, the difficulty may be surmounted by drawing the upper part of the thigh outwards while the knee is still held across the soimd one. The dislocation into the ischiatic notch is produced much in the same way as that on the dorsal surface of the-ilium, but does not happen so frequently. The symptoms also' are similar, and differ only in being less marked. There is less shortening—^less bending of the affected limb over the sound one—less inversion of the toes—and less displacement of the trochanter major. In obscure cases a good diagnostic will be afforded by trying to bring the thigh into a straight line with the trunk of the body, which is impossible while the bone is thus displaced. The patient, when lying upon his back, finds it necessary either to arch the loins so that the surgeon may press his hand between them and the bed, or to keep the thigh bent upwards on the pelvis. If the back is straightened the thigh ascends, and if the thigh is laid flat the back becomes arched. The reduction is accomplished in the same way that has just been described, though it has been found to require more force to lift the head of the bone out of its preternatural situation. The dislocation downwards is caused by heavy bodies falling ■qn the hip, while the limb is in a state of abduction. The symptoms are extremely characteristic, there being elongation to the extent of an inch and a half—abduction, owing to the stretching which is suffered by the gluteal muscles—and flexion of the thigh on the pelvis, from the same cause affecting the iliams intemus and psoas magmts. These symptoms are often simulated to a very perplexing extent by the involuntary obliquity of position which the pelvis acquires from irritation of the hip-joint, occasioned by blows or other kinds of external2tt PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY violence ; and inexperienced practitioners are consequently apt to commit the mistake of treating with rough measures a case that requires those of the most soothing sort. The best guide in avoiding this too common error is afforded by the trochanter major, which, when dislocation really exists, will be found by measurement to be more distant from the anterior spinous process of the ilium than its fellow is on the other side. The reduction is accomplished by extending and counter-extending the thigh and pelvis transversely, while the foot of the affected limb is carried inwards under the sound one. The dislocation forwards on the pubis is caused by the body being suddenly bent baclovards, while the foot is fixed and the limb is kept straight by the strong involuntary action of its extensor muscles. The symptoms are slight shortening, eversion of the toes, and the head of the bone being felt distinctly rolling under the integuments of the gi'OLn. The reduction is performed by extending downwards and backwards, while the patient lies on Ms soimd side, and then drawing the upper pai"t of the tliigh outwards, so as to lift the head of the femur over the acetabulum. It has often been a question at how great a length of time after the dislocation reduction may be effected. I have suc- ceeded at the end of seven and nine weeks ; but, in using force at a more distant period, should have little hope "of success, and some fear of doing harm, by deranging the process by which the displaced bone becomes accommodated to its new position. Knee-joint.—The patella may be dislocated laterally by direct violence, and this accident is most apt to happen when the parts concerned are in the relaxed state, which results from sudden removal of a dropsical effusion into the joint. The dislocation is very readily recognised, and admits of easy remedy, by bend- ing the thigh upon the pelvis while the knee is straight, so as to relax the extensor muscles completely, and then pressing the patella into its proper place. The tibia and fibula are so strongly connected with the femiu-, that they very seldom suffer dislocation. In consequence of a violent wrench to one side, there is sometimes a laceration of one245 JOINTS. or other of the lateral ligaments, and a partial displacement of the articulating surfaces of the tibia. In the rare cases of its complete dislocation, it has generally been found behind the femur; but according to Sir A. Cooper, it may also be driven forwaixls. The accident is very readily recognised, owing to the gi'eat size of the articulating surfaces, and the thinness of their siUTOimding parts. The reduction, which is not difficult, requires extension and counter-extension, accompanied with pressure on the dislocated bone. It is thought that the semilunar cartilages are subject to dis- placement, since x^ersons of relaxed frame sometimes complain of pain and stiffness in moving the knee, which are felt suddenly, and disappear no less so, when the joint is forcibly bent and extended. Ankle-joint—Though the ankle is frequently dislocated as a consequence of fracture through either malleolus, as has been noticed under the proper head, yet dislocation happens so rarely by itself, that it is hardly necessary to mention the possibility of its occurrence. This dislocation can be only backwards or for- wards, and is reduced chiefly by coaptation. Astragalus.—When a person falls from a height on his heel, the violence thus sustained not being diffused over a number of articulations, as when he alights on his toes, is transmitted to the astragalus with such intensity, as sometimes to eject it from its place, turn it upside down, and make it protrude under the integuments of the instep, or force its way through them. This dislocation seldom admits of reduction, and the bone, when so .displaced, must in general be removed. If an opening has not been caused by the accident in the first instance, one ought to be made without delay, in order to anticipate and prevent the violent inflammation that will otherwise occur, as the precursor of ulceration or sloughing, by which the loose astragalus must make its escape. Lower-javx—The lower-jaw cannot be dislocated so long as the mouth is closed, since tlie condyles are then firmly secured in the glenoid cavities. But when it is opened so as to bringPllINCIPLES OF SUBGEKY, 246 them forwards on the anterior convex part of the articular sur- faces, they may be readily displaced by a lateral impulse, or even by excessive action of the muscles. One or both of the condyles then glide forwards over the root of the zygomatic process ; and sinking into the hollow on the opposite side, retain the jaw fixed in a state of expansion. The reduction of this dislocation is extremely easy, since, if a fulcrum be placed at the back part of the grinding surface, the anterior portion of the jaw affords a powerful lever for replacing the deranged condyle or condyles. The best fulcrum for this pur- pose consists of one or both thumbs, accordingly as the dislocation is single or double, protected from the action of the teeth by being wrapped in the corners of a handkerchief or toweL After the reduction, the patient ought for some time to avoid opening his mouth wide, and exposing his jaw to the circumstances which favour a recurrence of the accident, as a considerable predisposi- tion to it remains. Clavicle.—The sternal extremity of the clavicle is sometimes dislocated forwards, in consequence of falls on the shoulder or arm. The displacement is readily recognised by the swelling arising from the projecting end of the bone and superjacent por- tion of the sterno-mastoid muscle, together with the mobility of the clavicle and depression of the shoulder that proceed from it. The dislocation is readily reduced by elevating the shoulder, and pressing down the sternal extremity of the clavicle, but returns so soon as the restraint which produces these effects is removed. A bandage, therefore, sufficient to retain the bone permanently in its proper position, should be applied; and the apparatus best calculated for doing this, consists of a sling to suppl)rt the arm, together with a compress placed on the end of the claAdcle, and secured by means of a figure of 8 bandage. The acromial extremity of the clavicle is also occasionally dislocated; but this accident requires no particular considera- tion, as its causes, symptoms, and treatment, are the same as those of fracture of the acromion, or acromial extremity of the clavicle.JOINTS. 247 Vefrteh'ce.—The vertebrae are very seldom dislocated without fractivre or morbid alteration of the bones ; and in all cases the accident is of importance chiefly in respect of the organs con- tained within the vertebral column, along with which, therefore, it may be more properly considered. y Wounds of the Joints, and Compound Dislocations. The synovial membrane is very prone to acute inflammation, wJ, «^h causes violent constitutional disturbance, and leads to the most destructive morbid alterations. Wounds of the joints, therefore, must always be regarded as serious injm-ies ; and the more so in proportion to the size of the joint, and degree of irrita- tion which accompanies the wound. The great object in treating such wounds should be to make them heal, if possible, by the first intention, which, of course, pre- vents the necessity of inflammation as the precursor of granulat- ing action. With this view, all sources of irritation, whether direct or indirect, that may seem to exist, ought to be removed. If there is displacement of the articvdating surfaces, they ought to be accurately reduced; and if the head of a bone protrudes, it should be cut away with the saw or pliers, since the distension that would be caused by its pressure would be apt to excite in- flammation. The edges of the wound should be placed in con- tact, and assiduously cooled by wet cloths frequently changed, while motion of the limb is carefully prevented by the applica- tion of splints. The constitutional treatment is to be conducted with the same view. The diet, in general, should be strictly antiphlogistic ; but here exceptions may require to be made on account of the peculiar circumstances of the case. When compound dislocations are treated on these principles, the necessity for amputation, which used formerly to be generally perfonned as their only remedy, is greatly lessened. The anlde- joiat is most subject to the accident, and the formidable appear- ances which are presented by it seem at first sight to warrant the removal of the limb ; but* when the projecting extremities of the bones are sawn off, the distortion rectified by suitable splints248 ' PRINCIPLES OF SURGKliV. 01- bandages, and the edges of the wound placed fairly togetlier, the cure is often accomplished very readily. The elbow and wi'ist-joints also may in general be preserved, but the knee-jomt, when subjected to the great imtation which attends both a dis- location and penetrating wound, can hardly be expected not to inflame, and either prove speedily fatal or require subsequent amputation. Hence in such an injury the limb wiU. generally rcquu-e to be amputated immediately. Gunshot wounds of the shoulder and elbow, vmless the integuments, blood-vessels, or nerves, are much injured, may be remedied by cutting out tlie articulation, as in cases of caries. Inflammation of Joints. Inflammation of the joints is attended \nth deep-seated pain, greatly aggravated by motion or pressure, swelling, redness, and tenderness of the integuments, and more or less constitutional distiirbance, according to the intensity of the local symptoms. It is caused by the direct initation of wounds, strains, and bruises ; and iudii'ectly, by exposure to cold, errors of diet or exercise, and whatever induces derangement of the system. The consequences of inflammation in this situation are numerous and important, as might be expected from the number and nature of the textures which enter into the constitution of the articular apparatus. The synovial membrane becomes the seat of dropsical and purulent effusions, adhesions, tliickening, and gelatinous degeneration ; the cartilage suffers ulceration and exfoliation ; and the bones are liable to suppuration, caries, and anchylosis, or union of their respective surfaces. The consequences of inflammation are serious in proportion to its severity, and the unsoimdness of the patient's constitution ; but it ought always to be dreaded, and induced, if possible, to terminate in resolution. When the symptoms are acute, blood should be freely ab- stracted locally by leeches or cupping ; and if there is much strength of action in the system, general bleeding may also be practised. Calomel and opium are very useful where tlierfe is much irritability; and the tartrate of antimony, given in fre-JOINTS. 249 queiitly-repeated doses, is a most valuable remedy, not only by allaying violent action, but also by promoting the secretions of the skin and mucous membranes. When the inflammation is sub-acute, warm fomentations, anodyne liniments, such as the liniment of soap and opiiim, with the iirternal use of diaphoretic mediciues, as Dover's Powder, calomel and opium, or vinum colcldci, afford most relief. In its chronic state, counter-irritation effected by stimulating liniments, blisters, tartrate of antimony, setons, and issues, especially those made by the actual cautery, "with perfect rest, and a moderate degree of pressure, are the means wluch deserve most confidence. In preventing motion, and effecting the compression deemed requisite, the best means certainly consist in the application of leather splints. Pieces of bend-leather, cut to the proper size, having been moistened and placed on each side of the joint, are closely moulded to its form by the pressure of a common roller. When dry and rigid, they are taken off and lined with some thinner and softer leather; after which they are again bandaged on, and employed so long as may be necessary. In cases where the knee is severely affected it is very important to prevent motion of the anlde-joint also, and for this • purpose I find nothing so useful as a sj^lint of iron wire covered with chamois leather, extending from the middle of the thigh to the toes. Dropsy of the Joints. The synovial membranes of the joints, though all similar to each other, and resembhug in structure as well as function the serous coverings of the soft parts, are not equally subject to dropsical effusion. It is extremely common in that of the knee, but very rare in all the others. Dropsy of the knee-joint is occasioned by a great variety of circumstances. It occurs most frequently in persons of weak and irritable constitutions; who often suffer from it in consequence of very slight direct initation, such as twists and bruises, or the indirect operation of exposure to cold. It is met with, however, occasionally in the strongest frames ; but then the irritation is250 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. always direct and severe; sucli as fracture of the patella or femur, especially in its lower third, or a violent strain. The effusion generally appears almost immediately after the injury- is received, and is at first attended with more or less acute symptoms of inflammation. It is readily recognised loj the swelling and fluctuation which are caused by its presence. The enlargement reaches as far up the thigh as the synovial mem- brane extends, it fluctuates when subjected to pressure, and the patella is felt to float, as it were, so that it may be made to strike upon the condyles of the femur if pushed downwards with mode- rate force. The means employed for treating this affection must vary with the acuteness of the inflammatory symptoms which attend it. In the first instance, it is often necessary to cup or leech and foment the joint, while constitutional remedies of a co-operative kind are at the same time administered. When the swelling ceases to be painful, but continues still more or less red, tender to pressure, and unable to bear motion, a cooling discutient lotion may be used with advantage. Finally, when there is no longer any indication of excited action, and the only inconvenience that remains is merely that occasioned by the presence of the fluid, the joint should be blistered once or oftener, according to the extent and dui'ation of the disease, and then carefidly bandaged. In cases of a rheumatic kind, blisters may be employed at an earlier stage with advantage. For some time after the cure is completed, the patient should wear a laced or elastic knee-cap, to protect the joint from the various external injuries to which it would be exposed in conseq^uence of its weakened state. Moveable Cartilages in Joints. Small moveable bodies are occasionally met with in the cavities of the joints, either quite detached or connected with the parietes of the articulation by a narrow neck. They have a glistening pearly lustre, and when divided are found to consist of a gristly substance enclosed in a firm capsule, with a bony nucleus in the centre. They are of various magnitudes, from the251 JOINTS. size of a barley-corn to tliat of a pigeon's egg, and are also very- different in their shape, wliicli is generally round, oval, or lenti- cular,, but sometimes tuberous. They exist either singly or in numbers together, but seldom exceed two or three. They have been discovered in several of the joints, but are by far most common in the knee. Even here, however, their presence may be considered a rare occiu'rence. They generally make their first appearance in adults. The origin of such bodies has been ascribed to the effusion and organization of blood and lymph—to the detachment by fracture of a portion of the articular surface—and to the separa- tion of morbid growths from the margin of the cartilages of the joints. The last of these explanations is on the whole the most probable, as the bodies in question are often observed by the patient to be fixed before they become moveable, and they have been repeatedly foimd on dissection adhering to the extremities of the bones. It may also be observed, that, so far as can be learned by external examination, they do not suffer any change of shape or size after they are first discovered. These bodies occasion ho inconvenience, except when they happen to be squeezed between the opposite articular surfaces ; they then excite a sudden and severe sickening pain, which forces the patient instantly to desist from the exertion in which he was engaged, and may even make him fall at once to the ground. In consequence of this irritation, repeated from time to time, the joint becomes the seat of a dropsical effusion, which is sometimes the first symptom of the disease that attracts the patient's attention, as he is apt to account for the pain previously suffered by referring it to rheumatism. Unless proper means are now employed, the use of the limb may be almost completely lost. The radical cure is easily effected by cutting mto the joint, and extracting the cause of irritation. But this very simple operation is attended with considerable risk of exciting such a degree of inflammation, as to endanger not only the patient's limb, but also his life. In order to diminish the danger, as far as possible, the patient should be confined to bed, and restricted252 PIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. to a regulated diet for some days previous to the operation. The cartilage should then be moved into that part of the joint which is most superficial—as over the flat surface of the external con- dyle.in the case of the knee—and held steadily there, whUe a free decided incision is made down upon it, so as to allow of its escape when urged out by the same pressure that was employed pre- viously to fix it, and render unnecessary any groping with hooks, forceps, etc.,-which must increase the chance of inflammation. The edges of the wound ought to be placed together, and kept constantly cool with wet cloths; the joint being at the same time protected carefully from motion, and all other kinds of ini- tation. It occurred to me, and nearly at the same time to a French surgeon, M. Goyrand, that the object of this operation might be attained more safely by merely dislodging the moveable body from the joint by puncturhig the skin with a needle or narrow-bladed knife, and opening the synovial membrane by a subcutaneous incision, through Mdiicli the body coiild be pushed into the cellular substance. The first case in which I tried this method was attended with a satisfactory result. The patient, a man about 40, of a very irritable constitution, was admitted in- to the Infirmary on account of a cartilage in the knee, which completely disabled him for any sort of active employment. Superficial suppuration took place a few days after the dislodg- ment; and it being necessary to make an opening for the dis- charge of matter, I took the opportunity of extracting the car- tilage. The joint remained free from disturbance. In executing this procedure the knife should be used very freely, so as to let the body escape without a dangerous degree of manipulation. Another method, which generally succeeds, is maldng a free sub- cutaneous incision through the synovial membrane and cartilage, and applying a blister over the part, where it is retained by a compress and bandage. Oelatinotis Degeneration of tJie Synovial Mcmh'ane. ^. The synovial membrane is liable to a process of morbid nu- trition, which changes its natural structure into a soft grayish-JOINTS. 253 yellow gelatinous mass, varying in thickness from a line to half an inch or more. This alteration usually occurs in individuals who are disposed to scrofulous action, whence it is generally named the Scrofulous affection of the synovial membrane. Though, met with at aU periods of life, it most frequently com-. mences in yoimg persons before the age of puberty, and is generally induced by some local cause of irritation, though there are many cases in which its origin seems to be entirely s]iontaneous. Tlie first symptoms of the disease that attract attention are swelling and diminished mobility of the joint affected. The swelling is soft, elastic, and colourless, and is diffused over the whole extent of the synovial membrane which does not cover the articulating cartilages. As the morbid thickening increases, the degree of enlargement and stiffness keeps pace with it, but still the patient hardly complains of pain. If the parts be examined by dissection during this stage, the synovial membrane is found more or less thickened, gelatinous, and vascular; the surroimd- rng cellular substance is greatly thickened and condensed by albuminous effusion into its interstices, and the ligaments do not present an outHne so distinct as usual, being matted together with the adjacent tissues. The joint may remain thus altered for months, or even years, without suffering any further change ; but the diseased condition at last terminates either in absorption or suppuration. In the former case, the articulation is restored more or less completely to its previous condition, but almost always continues somewhat swelled and stiff; in the latter, ■ openings into the joint are formed for the discharge of matter, the articular cartilages exfoliate or are absorbed, the cancellated structure of the bones is exposed, and the patient, if not relieved, either dies hectic, or recovers with a limb rigid and shrivelled. Instead of the joint, there is then either a perfeqtly unyielding union by osseous matter, Avhich is named Anclilyosis, or a firm fibrous bond of connection, constituting what is called false Anchylosis. The treatment of the disease in its first stage ouglit to bePRINCIPLES OF SUKGEKY. 254 directed with the view of preventing inflammation, inducing it to terminate in resolution if actually existing, and promoting ab- sorption of the morbid structure. In attaining the fii-st of these objects, it is necessary to protect the joint concerned from all irritations, both direct and indirect. Not only strains, blows, and violent exercise should be avoided, but also motion of any kind or degree ; to prevent which the more effectually, splints of leather may be advantageously employed, the limb being fixed in that position which will render it most useful to the patient after the cure is completed. The various actions of the system should be supported by a moderate allowance of nourishing food —^by exercise of such kind as will not derange the affected limb —and by medicine when it is found necessary. Should inflam- mation be unfortunately excited, leeches, cupping, fomentations, and general remedies, if the severity of the symptoms seem to require them, must be promptly and freely resorted to. But, in promoting absorption, it should be recollected that, as the disease depends upon a disordered state of the system, local remedies can be of very little service. Cod-liver oil, protection from cold, and freedom from motion, have the most powerful influence, while pressure, ointments of iodine with mercury, and lotions, are of hardly any use. Mr. Scott brought the advantages of pressure very prominently forward, and led many people to believe, that in this, as well as some other chronic affection of the joints, it may be deemed an almost certain remedy. Sir B. Brodie seems to have gone into an opposite extreme in regarding the disease, as incurable, and all the remedial measures proposed for its re- moval as at best only palliative. Pressure is apt to occasion pain, and by thus exciting irritation, give rise to inflammation, so as to hasten on the malady to its last stage ; it ought, there- fore, to be employed with great caution. The best plan of treat- ment is, after subduing any inflammatory symptoms that happen to exist, to surround the joint with a common roller, applied so firmly as to effect the desired degree of compression. Mr, Scott recommended slips of plaster instead of the roUer, and changed them not oftener than once in several weeks. But this practice255 JOINTS. seems objectionable on several grounds, since inflammation may thus be very easily overlooked, and allowed to proceed the length of suppuration before it is discovered ; and if things go on well, it is obvious that in a very short time the diminution of the swcllincf must render the bandage loose and inef&cient. The joint should always be restrained from motion by a splint, which may be made of leather or pasteboard, or iron wire, covered with chamois leather. The last-mentioned splint, which I have found extremely useful in treating affections of the joints, may be easily constructed by bending a piece of strong wire to the shape of the limb, so as to extend along both sides of it—and then joining as many pieces transversely as seem necessary to give sufficient strength—after which the apparatus merely requires a leather covering, between the layers of which some cotton or other soft substance may be placed. When suppvu'ation ensues, free vent ought to be afforded to the matter. Stimulating washes should be applied to the sinuses, and moderate pressure still carefully continued, together with, if possible, even more rigid abstinence from motion. If the patient's strength proves inadequate to support the profuse and long-continued discharge which is apt to result, he must be re- lieved by amputation, or excision of the diseased bone. It might be thought that the diseased synovial membrane would oppose the completion of a cure, even after the carious bone was eradi- cated, but experience has proved this to be not the fact; and all trace of the morbid structure in question soon disappears during the suppuration which succeeds the operation. Ulceration of the Cartilages of the Joints. The cartilages which cover the surfaces of articulation are often found to be destroyed more or less completely, becoming in some cases merely thinner than usual—in some rough and irregularly abraded—and in others detached from the bone, so as to lie in their natural situation, but nearly or altogether loose. These changes arc ascribed to a process of absorption in the car- tilages, commencing either on the surface of the synovial mem-PUINCIPLE8 OF SURGERY. 25G brane which lines them, or in the substance of the cartilage. Ulceration of the cartUages occm-s at all ages ; but is more common in adults than the disease wliich originates in thicken- ing of the synovial membrane. It is met with both ia persons of scrofulous constitutions, and in those subject to rheumatism, but cliiefly in the latter. The exciting causes are irritations of various lands, both direct and indirect, such as strains, bruises, and exposure to cold. It is indicated by deep-seated gnawing pain, often referred to one particular point of the articulation, aggravated by motion, and felt most severely at night. The patient also generally complains of pain in the joint beyond the one affected, or in more distant parts of the limb, which is usually throughout its whole extent more or less weak, cedema- tous, and cold. There is little swelling in the first instance, and no great degree of it subsequently, unless thickening of the syno^dal membrane be associated witli abrasion of the cartilages, wliich is not unfrec[uently the case. ' When there is no swelling fi'om this source, the enlargement that does take place is con- fined to the immediate neighbourhood of the joint, and is of a more firm, unyielding consistence than that accompanying the other disease, as it depends merely on thickening and condensa- tion of the cellular substance. Ulceration of the cartilages sometimes causes such violent pain and hectic irritation of the system, as to require amputation even while the parts remain in the ' state that has been described ; but, in general, it either goes on to suj)puration, or terminates in recovery. When suppuration takes place, the joint passes into nearly the same condition as that which exists in the last stage of the disease originating in the gelatinous degeneration of the synovial structure, so that it would be difficult to discover from dissection where the morbid changes had commenced ; and the case admits of cure only by anchylosis. When the disease ter- minates favourably before suppuration, some stifihess of the joint almost always remains. It appears that the articidating cai-tilage is never restored, whether it has been removed by interstitial absorption, or destroyed by ulceration, and that the osseous sur-257 JOINTS. faces deprived of it either unite together by means of a fibrous or bouy medium, or become extremely hard and perfectly smooth, so that they seem as if encrusted with porcelain. This Porce- lanous alteration of the articular surfaces, as it has been called, is far from rare in its occurrence. The corresponding bones are often grooved and ridged, so as to allow of motion in only one direction, and there is always an effusion of new osseous sub- stance around the margin of the joint, as if an attempt had been made to effect anchylosis. This condition may be regarded as a substitute for the cartilage in facilitating motion, and is observed occasionally in the new joints resulting from dislocation. K the stiffness depends on time anchylosis or osseous union, it does not admit of any remedy, but when the connection is of a fibrous kind, much may be done to increase the degree of mobility. In conducting the treatment of this disease, the fii-st object is obviously to protect the joint from all irritations tending to render the morbid action more acute, and hasten it on to sup- pm-ation. For this purpose pei'fect rest, insured by means of splints and bandages, together with strict attention to the various secretions, ought to be particularly insisted upon. The next and not less important object is to subdue the chronic inflammation, or ulcerative action, which is going forwards. With this view all sorts of coimter-irritation are in common use, but it appears that the choice of them need not be very extensive, if due regard be paid to then- effects. Issues have unquestionably most power in checking the morbid action, but the means by which they are opened is not a matter of indifference. Caustic, moxa, and the SiCtual cautery, may all be employed for the purpose, but the last-mentioned agent is infinitely preferable to the others. It is often thought that the pain which attends the opening of the issue affords all the benefit that is derived from it, and that, therefore, the moxa, which usually produces a superficial effect, should be selected. But it is well ascertained that any con- siderable amendment can in general be hardly perceived, until the discharge of the new secreting surface has been fairly estab- lished. The ulcers of burns are always very slow in healing, and srKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 258 hence there is (111 obvious advantage of the cautery over the caustic; but its chief recommendation is the result of experi- ence, and this is so strong as to leave no room for doubt or hesitation in preferring it to the other means. When the cauteiy is used, an eschar three or four inches long should be formed on each side of the joint. In mild cases, and during convalescence, the forcible aspersion of warm water by pumping, or pouring from a height, is attended with much benefit. To remedy tlie rigidity tliat remains after recovery, steaming with the vapour of hot water, frictions with gently stimulating liniments, shampooing, and persevering exercise, are the means that ought to be employed. Nervous or Hysterical Affections of the Joints. Young women, particxilarly those of the higher ranks, are apt to suffer from painful sensations in the joints, which closely simulate the symptoms of articular disease connected with alteration of structure, and consequently are apt to lead to treat- ment no less unnecessary than injurious. Counter-irritation and confinement in such cases tend to increase the constitutional derangement which gives rise to the complaint, and ought, there- fore, to be carefully abstained from, imless it maybe thought neces- sary to make an impression, in the fii'st instance, on the patient's mind by some active measures. In general, the proper course is to pursue an invigorating mode of life by using the shower-bath, taking the preparations of iron, and regularly exercisulg the limbs as well as the body. The spine, knee, hip, ankle, and wiist joints are the most common seats of this troublesome affection. In respect to its diagnosis, the absence of swelling, or any other symptom except pain, together vdth the time of life and general condition of the patient, constitute the best marks of distinction from structural derangements. Sir B. Brodie, to whom the profession are much indebted for the attention wliich he has directed to this form of nervous disease, considers, as one of the best characters for its recognition, the sensibility of the patient to impressions on the surface of the joint that cannot possibly affect the condition of the articulation, pinching the skin being259 JOINTS. eij[ually effectual for causing wincing, as moving the limb or pressing the articular siufaces against each other. Tlie whole system is usually observed to be in a highly sensitive excitable state; but sometimes presents all the characters of perfect health. The uneasy feelings, though frequently remaining months or years, generally commence and disappear suddenly —whence empiricism is afforded a good field, which has been diligently cultivated. Morbus Coxarim. The morbus coxarius, or hip-disease, is an affection of the liip- joint, wMch requires separate consideration, not so much on account of any pecuKarity in its nature, as from the frequency of its occurrence and importance of its effects. It prevails in cold moist climates, and attacks chiefly cluldren between the ages of seven and fourteen, though it is not unfrequently met with both before and after this time of life. The first symptom complained / of is generally pain of the knee, which often exists for months '' before attention is directed to the true seat of the disease.'*.- " ... Sooner or later the patient is observed to walk awlcwardly, and less vigorously than usual; and when the circumstances on which this difference depends are investigated, it appears that the affected limb is elongated and emaciated—that the convexity of the hip is flattened, so that the sulcus between it and the thigh is less distinct and more oblique in its dii'ection—and that in standing, the foot is advanced a little with the toe slightly everted, and that the patient does not rest his weight upon it. Eain is now felt in the hip-joint itself, and though aggravated by motion, often becomes more severe from time to time without any such cause of irritation. It is most apt to do so during the night, particularly when the weather is wet and changeable. In this second stage, the disease remains generally several months. At length the symptoms which have been mentioned either dis- appear, and the limb recovers its former condition, or they are succeeded by others still more disagreeable. In the latter case the limb becomes considerably shorter than the sound one, itsPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 260 mobility at the same time being mucli impaired or altogether destroyed, and permanent eversion or inversion taking place. Collections of matter now generally make their appearance, most frequently pointing on the outer side of the thigh below the trochanter major, but occasionally in the groin or hip, and issue externally through openings formed either by ulceration or artificially by the surgeon. The patient then, after a tedious ill- ness, becomes hectic and dies ; or recovers with a stiff anchylosed joint and wasted useless limb. Such being the insidious and destructive progress of the morbus coxarius, it is evidently of much consequence to ascer- taiu rhe nature and most efficient treatment of the disease. As opportunities of dissecting the paiis in the first and second stages of the morbid process very seldom occur, being confined to those cases in which the patient dies of some other disease, the origin of the evil is still involved in considerable obscurity. Different authorities, accordingly, refer it to thickening of the synovial'^, membrane, ulceration of the cartilages, and inflammation of the bones. But although the second of these opinions is the one generally received in this country, there seems good reason for considering the one last mentioned as nearer the tmth. The facts that have been collected by actual examination are in favoiir of this view, and the symptoms observed externally all lead to the same conclusion. The long existing pain at distant parts of the limb, before any trace of disease at the part really affected can be obser'ved, is strongly characteristic of chronic inflammation in the osseous tissue ; the freedom of motion with- out any crepitus, that continues during the second stage, is hardly reconcilable with either ulceration of the cartilage, or thickening of the synovial membrane ; and the perfect state of the joint in cases of recovery is not consistent with the previous existence of disease in the articular surfaces. In the third stage there is imfortunately no want of opportunity for investigation by the Icnife; but then, as always happens in diseases of the joints which have advanced to sixppuration, the whole articular ap- paratus is so involved ifi the destructive process, that the partJOINTS. 261 primarily affected cannot be recognised. lu tlii'ee cases wliicli I have dissected at tlie beginning of the third stage—that is, after suppuration, but before the matter was discharged externally— the articular cartilage was sound eveiywhere, both on the head of the femur and on the acetabulum, except a small portion not so large as a sixpence at the centre of this cavity, where it was removed, and allowed a probe to pass into or rather through the bone. That cases of ulceration of the cartilages of the hip-joint do occasionally occur, there can be no doubt, both from the symptoms and dissections that have been observed ; but that these bear a very smaU proportion to those in which the disease originates in the bone seems no less certain. The disease may be then regarded as in general consisting primarily and essentially of chronic inflammation in the bones composing the joint, of which the pelvic portion usually suffers more than the femur ; and the means proper for subduing it are % consequently those which have been found most efficacious in the treatment of such affections of the articular apparatus. When the sjnnptoms are not severe, as is usually the case in the early stage, perfect rest alone is required, though it may be prudent also to apply occasionally a few leeches to the groin. For preventing motion, nothing answers so well as the long splint, applied in the same way that has been advised for fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, no extension being effected, but merely complete fixture of the limb in a line with the trimk of the body. But if the pain is severe, so as to disturb the patient's sleep, or continues after the means just mentioned have been employed, which is very seldom the case, recourse must be had to counter- irritation ; and though the various methods of effecting it by blisters, setons, caustic issues, and moxa, are all occasionally beneficial, the actual cautery ought always to be preferred as the most powerful means that can be employed. The best place for applying it is the hollow between the trochanter major and the tidoerosity of the ischium, where abroad eschar, several inches in length, should be formed. The patient must be kept perfectly quiet during the euro, which generally requires several months.2G2 PIUNGIPLEH OF SUItCIKUY. He seldom experiences mucli benefit \intil tlie slough separates, and the ulcerated surface begins to discharge freely. Should there appear any tendency to heal prematurely, it may be easily checked by applying some diluted ointment of cantharidcs ; and if the sore remain? open after the diseased action seems to be at an end, some astringent wash, such as the solution of the acetate of lead, should be applied to promote its cicatrization. When the disease goes on to suppuration in adults, the case may be considered nearly hopeless, as caries then almost always ensues, ^nd being seated in a part where excision cannot be performed, inevitably proves fatal to the patient sooner or later. In children the chance of recovery is much greater, but the limb in this case remains small, rigid, and distorted, the toes being turned some- times inwards, sometimes outwards. When the head of the femur is little affected, and the ravages of the disease, as usually happens, are chiefly exerted on the acetabulum, the thigh is rotated inwards, and presents nearly the same appearance as that which results from ordinary dislocation on the ilium. But when the head of the bone is destroyed by ulceration or inter- stitial absorption, the various muscles tending to effect rotation outwards, being no longer opposed by the usual mechanical resist- ance, draw the limb into nearly the same position which foUows fracture of the neck of the femur, and point the toes outwards. / Excision of the Joints. It has been exj)lained in regard to the treatment of caries, that the only remedy for this condition is removal of the affected portion of the bone. Amputation was formerly regarded as almost the only means of relief from carious joints. But it is now fully ascertained, that, on many occasions, the limb may be saved by cutting out the articulation. The softened, discoloured, and ulcerated integuments, the thickened and indurated cellular substance, and the gelatinous synovial membrane, are found to afford no serious obstacle to recovery, provided the whole of the bone, so far as it is actually carious, be taken away. The operation requisite for this purpose, though severe, is not more263 JOINTS. dangerous than ainpiitatiou, because the joint, previous to its performauce, has been opened by the disease ; the whole of the articulating tissues, wliich are apt to suffer violent inflammation when irritated, are either previously destroyed or removed ; the great blood-vessels and nei-ves are not interfered with ; and the patient is not subjected to the shock which is caused by taking away a limb. As to the joints which may be subjected to this operation, it is evident, I think, that the extent to which the acetabulum is almost always affected in the hij)-disease forbids any attempt at excision. Though experience has not yet fully decided whether the limbs that might be preserved by cutting out the knee and ankle joints would be preferable to the artificial substitutes which may be worn in their stead, it seems pretty well ascer- tained that in general they would not. The wrist also, from the number of bones, and complexity of articulations entering into its formation, together with the numerous tendons, arteries, and nerves passing over it, does not seem to be favourable for the operation. But the elbow and shoulder joints, while theix struc- tiu-e and situation are most convenient for excision, hold out the greatest inducements to effect their removal without performing imputation. In all ranks and circumstances of life, the use of the hand is of great consequence ; and even although the elbow or shoulder were to remain stiff and motionless, if the hand could be preserved entire and serviceable by excision of these joints, this would be infinitely preferable to taldng away the limb. But it has been proved by numerous facts, that wliile the • joints beyond the disease remain as useful as ever, the one which has undergone the operation may regain such a degree of mo- bility and subjection to the action of its muscles as to render it hardly distinguishable from a sound one. There is no new joint, strictly speaking, formed, but a strong fibrous substance unites the extremities of the bones, and by its flexibility allows them to move within proper bounds ; while the muscles obtain new attachments, so as to perform their usual office, and even tlie bones regain somewhat of their original form.PKINCIPLES OF SUllGERY. 2G4 Shoulder-Joint.—Different methods have been Ibllowed in cutting out the shoulder-joint, but it will be sufficient to describe the one wliich appears to be the most convenient. The surgeon introduces a straight, sharp-pointed knife under the coracoid process, thrusts it down to the head of the humerus, and then cuts perpendicularly, close upon the bone, nearly as far as the attachment of the deltoid. In order to detach the head of the humerus, he introduces the fore-j&nger of his left hand into the joint, and using it as a guide for the knife, sej)arates the attach- ments of the muscles, which are inserted into the greater and smaller tuberosities. The arm being then drawn backwards, the head of the bone protrudes through the wound, and being grasped in the hand, may be readUy sawn off. The glenoid cavity should next be examined, and if it is found to requu-e removal, the best mode of procedure is to thrust a knife through the posterior pai-t of the deltoid to the neck of the scapula, and then cut downwards along its inferior costa, until sufficient space is obtained for introducing the bone-pUers, of which the blades may be easily insinuated so as to enclose the whole part that requires to be taken away. This is much better than attempt- ing to dig out the glenoid cavity tlirough the anterior incision. The only arteries cut during the operation that in general require to be tied, are a branch of the Thoracica humeraria and the anterior circumflex. The edges of the wound should be stitched together, and some light dressing having been applied, the arm ought to be supported by a sling. The patient need not be confined to bed beyond a day or two, or so long as the fever excited by the operation continues ; and when the woimd begins to heal, he must gently exercise the limb to prevent it from becoming stiff. The credit of performing this operation for the first time has been ascribed to Mr. White of Manchester (1769); but there seems good reason for believing that the case being one of necrosis, not caries, he merely removed part of the exfoliation before it had become detached from the living bone. The patient was a boy 14 years of age, who "had been suddenly seized about265 JOINTS. a fortniglit before with a violent iuflammatiou in his left shoulder, which threatened a mortification, but at last temiinated in a large abscess, which was opened with a lancet a few days before his admission." Through this opening, and another that had formed spontaneously under the acromion process, the os humeri could be felt and seen " totally divested of its bursal ligament." Mr. White made an incision from the acromion process half- way down the arm, protruded the end of the bone through the opening thus obtained, and sawed it off. At the end of two months he found that a large piece of the remaining bone had become loose, and easily removed it with a pair of forceps. The patient was perfectly cured at the end of four months from the operation. The arm was then not quite an inch shorter than the other, and he had the perfect use of it. In a work published ^thirty-two years ago, ijexpressed my persuasion that this was not a case of caries, as it had generally been regarded, but one of acute necrosis ; and the following very curious companion to it, at a more advanced stage, seems strongly corroborative of that opinion. Tliomas Cairns, aged 13, was admitted into the Infirmary on the 30th of June 1833, on account of a great enlargement of the right shoulder, attended with pain and discharge of matter. It was stated that, ten menths before, he had fallen from a wall about four feet high among loose stones, and afterwards had been pretty severely handled by a bone-sf ttpr^ who alleged that the humerus was broken near the joint. Inflammation and suppuration fol- lowed, openings for the discharge of matter took place at various •parts, the joint became stiff, and the patient's strength declined. In these circumstances, he was sent to be under my care. As it was impossible to obtain any satisfactory information in regard to the condition of the joint by introducing a probe, I enlarged the sinues that led most directly towards it sufficiently to admit my finger, with the point of which the bone was felt bare. The firmness of the surrounding parts prevented a more free examination, but the information thus gained, together with * Treatise on the Excision of Diseased Joints, 1831.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. the history of the case, convinced me that a portion of the bone was dead, and detached, I therefore extended upwards the incision already made, finding it necessary to use for this purpose both the knife and cutting-pliers, and then ascertained that the exfoliation lay loose in a bony case. Being unwilling to remove any of the new-formed osseous substance which was destined to take the place of the old bone, I forcibly dilated tlie edges of the aperture until the shell gave way sufficiently to permit extraction . of the sequestrum. After the principal portion was removed, some small pieces were found lying in the cavity, which proved to be fragments of the dense plate that had formed the convex surface of the head of the bone. The glenoid cavity of the scapula was divested of cartilage, but covered with a smooth firm velvet-like lining. Kecovery was delayed by unhealthy action of the sore, which assumed a phagedenic and afterwards a sloughing character, but was so far completed on the 7th of September that the boy returned home with an arm not per- ceptibly shortened, and, though still stiff at the shoulder, nearly as useful as ever. I saw the patient, some years afterwards, grown up to be a strong active man. In 1826, I operated on a shoulder-joint which had been diseased, for upwards of seven years, and had reduced the patient, a female between thirty and forty years of age, to the greatest degree of exhaustion. The head of the humerus was completely excavated and carious, and presented a most favourable oppor- tunity for excision. Eecovery was soon completed, and for many years afterwards, until she died of some other complaint, the poor woman was enabled to lead an active industrious life, with the full use of her arm for all ordinary employments. . It should be known that this joint is remarkably distinguished by its liabilit}' to suffer from disease in one of the bones composing it, wliile the other remains free from the same derangement—so that the head of the humerus may suffer from absorption and caries, while the glenoid cavity is no otherwise changed than by the removal of its cartilage. This important peculiarity, until lately, did not admit of any satisfactory explanation, but has had some lightJOINTS. 2G7 thrown upon it by a case in which I found the coracoid process of the scapula and the head of the humerus suffering from disease, while the glenoid cavity was free from it, there being at the same time reason to believe that inordinate contraction of the biceps had been the cause of derangement. As the shoulder-joint is distinguished from all others by its anatomical structure in respect to the long head of the biceps passing through it, the peculiarity of pathological condition in question may therefore with some reason be attributed to this source. \ Elbcno-Joint.—In excision of the elbow-joint, it is necessary to expose the articulation freely, and with this view the integu- ments may be divided, either by a single longitudinal incision—as Mr. Park originally proposed—or in the more complicated form adopted by the Messieurs Moreau, wliich was like the letter H, the transverse cut being from side to side along the upper edge of the olecranon. The latter method is that wliich, until lately, I have employed, and perfoi-med hundreds of times with the most satis- factoiy result. It certainly is the easiest mode of procedure, but the former plan has a decided advantage in regard to the after- treatment, from not being' exposed to the inconvenience which attends the tranverse incision, if it does not heal by the first in- tention, and allow the edges to separate. If, therefore, the cir- cumstances permit its performance, the simple longitudinal incision should be preferred, especially in cases of anchylosis, where there is a great tendency to secondary hemorrhage, and consequently much risk of primary union being prevented. The integuments in either of these ways having been separated • from their subjacent connection, and the ulnar nerve held aside, the olecranon should be removed by the cutting-pliers, and then the lateral ligament at the radial side of the joint having been divided, the knife may be safely passed round the extremity of the humerus, so as to let the saw be applied a little above the tuberosities, after which, the radius and ulna being similarly ex- posed, shoidd have their extremities removed on a line with the lower edge of the coronoid process. Any vessel that requires a ligature should then be tied, and the edges of the wound havingPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 268 been retained together by silver sutures, a roller is to be applied in tlie figure of 8 for giving the requisite support, wliich it does much better than any soi-t of splint. In determining the extent to which it is necessary to remove the bone, the truly carious part must be carefully distinguished from the rough and thickened state of the neighboiu'ing bone, which depends upon the effusion of new osseous substance in consequence of the disease causing irritation. When we read of the humerus being cut out to the extent of four inches, it may be safely concluded that this discrimination has not been duly regarded. The cases admitting this operation are much more frequent than those proper for excision of the shoulder-joint. Having adopted the practice when it was almost entirely neglected in this country, and employed it very extensively as well as suc- cessfully, I feel great pleasure in contemplating the benefit that has been derived from its introduction into general use. I have also employed it with great advantage in cases of anchylosis both from disease and injury. Tn such cases, after the flaps are reflected so as to expose the bones, their union should be divided by the saw, after which each of the ends may be readily removed to the extent requisite.MUSCLES. 20 9 CHAPTER XITI. MUSCLES. Injuries of Micsdes. The muscular tissue is not by any means prone to diseased action, and in general suffers little irritation from the injuries to which it is subjected. Wounds.—An incision m the long direction of a muscle occa- sions very little inconvenience, and the wound heals without any remarkable difference from one confined to the integuments. Biit if the muscular fibres are divided transversely, their con- tractility causes a separation of the sides of the wound, more or less considerable, according to circumstances. No new muscular substance is ever formed to supply the defect, and it conse- quently remains permanent, the intermediate space being occu- pied by a dense fibrous substance. The muscle concerned is for a time rendered weak in action, owing to the relaxation of its fibres ; but in general it gradually becomes accommodated to the change, and acts with its former vigour. In order to prevent this separation of the cut extremities as much as possible, the patient should be made to assume such a position as will most effectually relax the injured muscles. Sutures would have little effect in counteracting the retractile tendency, and it is not thought right to employ them lest they should excite irritation. Punctured wounds of muscles are frequently followed by diffused inflammation and extensive sup- puration ; but these effects are to be ascribed to the form of the wound, and the thick fascia which it generally penetrates before reaching the muscle. In gunshot wounds, and extensive lacera- tion of the muscidar texture, a troublesome degree of swelling is270 PKINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY. apt to proceed from expansion of the soft or vascular substance concerned, and requires the pressure of carefully-applied bandages. Rupture and Strains of Muscles by their own Action.—The complete rupture of a muscle by the overaction of its own con- tractile power is an extremely rare occurrence. Instances of it have, however, been observed in the recti muscles of the abdo- men and rectus femoris. The symptoms are sudden inability to perform the accustomed motions, and a vacuity perceptible on external examination of the part affected. The treatment consists in approximating the ruptured extremities as much as possible by the position of the patient, and by bandaging. When the parts become consolidated, the usual power is regained. Partial_rupture of muscles from violent exertion is far from being imcommon. The situation in which it occurs most fre- quently is the calf of the leg, where the soleiis is apt to have some of its fibres torn during extension of the ankle-joint. This is more apt to happen from an inadvertent than a voluntarily violent exertion, and generally occurs without the patient being aware of making any effort. The symptoms are a sudden sensa- tion similar to that which would be caused by a blow on the injured part, succeeded by severe pain, and inability of using not only the muscle injured, but also those associated with it in action, together with swelling and ecchymosis of the limb. The treatment consists in maintaining perfect rest, using warm fomentations while the pain continues, and then applying moderate pressure by means of a bandage, together with lotions or liniments, such as the solution of acetate of lead with opium, or the tincture of soap and opium. The cure is more or less tedious according to the extent of the injury, and reqmres from a few days to as many months for its completion. Strains without rupture are not unfrequently occasioned by violent muscular action. The patient suffers severe pain at the injured part, and is unable to perform almost any motion with the affected muscles. In a day or two the pain subsides; but weeks often elapse before the original strength is regained. This accident is most apt to happen in the loins, where the long271 MUSCLES. muscles of tlie back are subjected to violent exertion in lifting heavy weights, etc. The treatment requires in the first instance repose, warm fomentations, and sometimes the local abstraction of blood. After the pain has ceased, or has lost its intensity, friction with some stimulating liniment, and the support of a flannel bandage, are the best means that can be employed. Dislocation of a muscle is met with only in the case of the latisd-mis doisi, and here very rarely. The portion of this muscle which lies over the inferior angle of the scapula and braces it to the chest, seems, especially in weak relaxed indi- viduals, so loosely connected with the bone, that a very slight force would be sufficient to cause its displacement downwards. Such a dislocation does accordingly sometimes happen, but so seldom that few practitioners have an opportunity of seeing more than one or two instances of it. The accident is easily recognised by the projection of the lower extremity of the scapula, particularly when the arm is raised or separated from the side. All attempts to replace the muscle in such cases have proved unavailing. And the only remedy that can be advised is a bandage to press down the bone, and promote the formation of new adhesions between it and the muscle. Derangements in the Nutritive and Functional Actions of Muscles. It has already been observed, that the muscular tissue is little disposed to morbid action, and though diseases sometimes extend into it from the neighbourhood, there is no part of the •body in which alteration of structure so rarely originates. The carcinomatous and medullary sarcomatous degenerations sooner or later engage every structure that lies near the one in which they originate, and the muscles are not spared. Scrofulous tubercles occur in every tissue, but are rarely met with in the substance of muscles. Fibrous tumours have been met with in the muscles, but still more seldom. Absorption sometimes occurs in muscles so as to occasion an atrophy or wasting of them. This occurrence may be con-272 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY, fined to a single muscle or affect a whole gronp of them. It is generally induced by some irritation, as that of a blow or irritating wound. The pricks sustained in dissecting have led to such con- sequences. There does not seem to be any efficient means of -pve- venting or removing this morbid action when it has commenced. The functional action of muscles depends very much upon the nervous system; and derangement of it is to be regarded, in general, rather as symptomatic of changes in the condition of that important system, than indicative of any alteration in the organs with which it is more immediately connected. It sometimes happens, however, that inordinate disposition to contract, and also in other cases deficiency of contractile power, are met with, when the muscles themselves appear to be the seat and cause of the disease. One muscle, or a group of muscles, occasionally contracts with unusual energy, and either without any, or with very imperfect, intermissions of relaxation. A permanent deformity or unusual position of part of the body is thus caused, which becomes increased in degree from time to time owing to paroxysms of contraction. These paroxysms are extremely variable in their frequency and duration. They often occur without any assignable cause, but are usually induced or aggravated by irritations, whether of body or mind. The muscles affected in course of time enlarge, and project more than is natural; they are also the seat of uneasy sensations, and are painful on pressure. This morbid action of the muscles is most frequently met with in the neck, especially in the sterno-mastoid. It then occasions one kind of wry-neck, the head being turned habitually to the opposite side. The treatment of this disease consists in removing all sources of irritation, whether direct or indirect, that may be discovered to be in operation. The state of the various secretions ought to be carefully inquired into, and rectified if deranged. If there are symptoms of local irritation, leeches, warm fomentations, and anodyne liniments, should be applied over the seat of the disease; and if these means fail, blisters and acupuncturation may be tried.MUSCLES. 273 Single muscles, or groups of muscles, are more frequently- met with in the opposite state to that which has just been de- scribed, their power of contracting being much diminished or altogether lost. The muscles of the face and fore-arm are most subject to this affection, and they suffer from it variously, both as to degree and extent. At one time it is the flexors alone, at another the extensors, and in some cases both together, which lose the power of action. The cause of this condition is some- times a blow, when the cure is usually tedious and imperfect. All that can be done is to use fomentations, frictions, and perse- vering attempts to exercise the muscles. The causes more fre- quently concerned are exposure to cold and long-continued pressure, and both of these often seem to be conjoined in pro- ducing the effect; as the most common history of the disease is, that the patient fell asleep in the open air, or in some unusual situation, and rested his head on one arm. In such cases, the cure is in general readily accomplished by applying a succession of blisters along the course of the affected muscles. Contraction of Muscles—Gluh-foot—Wryneck—Strabismus. In addition to that temporary or spasmodic contraction which has been already mentioned, the muscles are liable to a permanent shortening of their natural length, necessarily pro- ducing deformity, as well as causing inconvenience from restrict- ing motion. Such contractions of the muscles are occasionally congenital, as in the common case of club-foot, which depends not upon any faulty conformation of the bones, but upon a want of due balance in the muscular powers of the limb. In general, the foot is turned inwards (Varies); but sometimes, though very rarely, it is found in the opposite direction {Valgus). The foot may also be maintained in a state of extension without any lateral inclination (Pes eguinus); but this condition is hardly met with as a congenital derangement, and usually occurs in childhood, especially during the period of teething, or after an attack of the exanthematous diseases to which that age is liable. Until recent years, the treatment of club-foot, in all its TPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 271 forms, was limited to the employment of various apparatus with the view of counteractiag the muscles by mechanical force, and gradually elongating them so as to remedy the distortion. This process was excessively tedious, expensive, and too frequently, with every care, imperfect in its effect. Hence the number of adults to be seen everywhere, especially in the lower ranks of life, retaining the bones of their limbs in a perverted position, untU, becoming altered in their form, they constitute supports for the body of very defective utiUty, and no less unseemly appearance. A great improvement has been introduced into practice by surgeons of the present age, particularly Stromeyer and Dieffen- bach. It consists in dividing the tendons of the contracted muscles by subcutaneous incision, and thus at once removing the grand obstacle in the way of treatment, which, when this has been done, merely requii-es such a degree of mechanical sup- port as may compensate for the state of contraction and relax- ation in which the ligaments necessarily remain for a time. The sooner the operation for this purpose is performed the better ; but it may be undertaken without impropriety so long as the bones have not suffered such an alteration of form as must render them unfit for assuming their natural position. This is more especially the case in simple extension of the foot (pes equinus, or pointed toe), which may be remedied in appa- rently the most confirmed degree, provided the astragalus is not displaced so very far forwards that it does not admit of being returned into its proper position. In dividing the tendons, instruments of various shapes and sizes have been employed. The knife should have a very small and narrow blade, with blunt back. An assistant should hold the foot so as to stretch moderately the tendons about to be cut, and then the operator, pinching up the integuments lying over it with the thumb and fore-fmger of his left hand, introduces the knife with its flat edge between the skin thus elevated and the tendon. The integuments being now left free, the cutting edge is directed upon the tendon, and by a slight sawing motion, aided with pressure on the back of the blade, readily completesMUSCLES. 2V5 tlie sectiou. A sudden snap, or absence of previous tension, distinctly denotes when this has been effected. A piece of dry lint is then to be appKed on the puncture ; and to insure healing of the wound it is prudent to afford the support of a pretty long bandage with the view of preventing motion. At the end of two or three days the foot may be placed in the boot provided for it. The best apparatus of this kind is merely a strong boot made of bend leather—moulded into the requisite form while moist—ar.d may be employed with great advantage as a substitute for the more complicated machines in common use. As to the selection of tendons for division, the circnmstances of the case must of course be the guide. In varus the tendo Achillis, tibialis antims or posticus, and in valgus the peronei, are most frequently in fault. But in talipes or pes equinus, nothing more is required than division of the tendo Achillis. Indeed, favourable cases of the last-mentioned kind are remedied almost at once by this operation, without the assistance of any mecha- nical means; since the action of standing or walking is of itself sufficient for restoring the limb to its proper shape,'so soon as the opposing muscular contraction is removed. In one remark- able case, where both feet were affected, the patient, a young man who was about to sail for Australia, walked without any assist- ance, before the end of a week after I had divided the tendons. Wry-Neck. The sterno-mastoid muscle occasionally becomes contracted, and causes a very awkward distoiiiion, the head being drawn to- wards the clavicle on the side affected, while the face is turned in the opposite direction ; and unless relief be soon afforded, the trunk is apt to suffer a degree of lateral curvature, from the want of due balance at its upper extremity. Attempts to remedy this deformity, by division of the muscle, were made at an early period; but being effected by free incision of the integuments, proved severe in their execution, and unsatisfactory in their results. In 1831,1 thought of performing the operation in the way of subcutaneous incision, by means of a knife so nanw-276 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. bladed as merely to puncture the skin. The patient was in- stantly and completely relieved, without any pain or subsequent inconvenience. It appears that nearly at the same time Dieffen- bacli had adopted this method, and that ten years earlier it had been practised in one case by the late M. Dupuytren. Every case of wry-neck that has come under my care since the one just mentioned, I have treated in this manner with invariable success. I have seldom found it necessary to divide more than the sternal portion of the muscle, at the distance of an ijich above the clavicla No dressing or indeed after-treatment of any kind is required, since the distorted parts soon regain their natural position. Straiismus. Strabismus or squinting has always been loiown to depend upon unequal action of the recti muscles of the eyeball, and the idea of affording relief by their division has occasionally pre- sented itself, though not until lately carried into effect. It was only in 1838 that Dieffeubach first performed this operation with success, and since that time it may be said, without exaggeration, to have been repeated in thousands of cases. The procedure being new was eagerly seized upon by the youngest and least experienced members of the profession as an unappropriated territory, wliich might be made their own through the claim of early possession, and the public made to believe, by newspaper advertisements and the titles of trumpery pamphlets on the sub- ject, that the operation was somehow different in its nature from the ordinary practice of surgery—not requiring for its proper performance the usual qualifications of experience, dexterity, and judgment—and best exercised by persons having no claim to confidence in any other department of the profession. The con- sequences may be readily anticipated. No discrimination of cases being made, and no difference in the treatment adopted according to the variety of cii'cumstances, while the fundamental doctrine of invariable success opposed that fair statement of the results which might have tended to improvement, fi-equent failures, and the loss of not a few eyes, have brought the opera-MUSCLES. 277 tiou into a considerable degree of discredit. Having had occasion to divide the muscles for squinting very extensively in that class of patients which permitted me to watch the progress and ascertain the final issue of the treatment, I feel entitled to express a highly favourable opinion of the operation, provided it be conducted on proper principles; and these I will now endeavour to explain. Strabismus is not a congenital derangement, as used to be thought, but commences during infancy or the early years of childhood. It freqxiently seems to be connected with some of the febrile affections incident to this age ; and though often met ^ ' with in several members of the same family, cannot justly be attributed to imitation. The obliquity is for the most part con- fined to one eye, and when both are affected, they suffer alter- nately. In a very large proportion of cases the eyeball is turned inwards to the nose, so that the leer or outward squint is not . seen, I should say, more than once in fifty cases. Squinting is not only unseemly in appearance, but usually attended with more or less deficiency in the power of vision,—the patient being seldom able to read or distinguish any minute objects with the affected eye. This was formerly thought to cause the complaint, but is now ascertained to be its effect, and to depend merely upon the inability of attending to the different impressions made • on the eyes at the same time, so that one of tliem being habitually disregarded, the organ ceases to be serviceable. A lady who squinted inwards with both eyes alternately found that she saw distant objects best with one, and near ones with the otlier. A gentleman who squinted outwards with both eyes alternately complained that, in driving, he felt great difficulty in avoiding obstacles from inability to judge accurately of distances. If the eyes are restored to their proper directions at an early age, the vision of both usually becomes perfect, but in elderly persons there is seldom more than a partial improvement. The internal or external recti muscles occasion the obliquity, but do not affect this, as in the case of club-foot or wry-neck, by permanent contraction. The patient can usually render the eye straight by a voluntary effort, and whenever the sound one isI'lUNClPLES OF SURGEliY. 278 closed, the other ceases to squint; bat, if the eyelids are then suddenly opened, the eye, however straight it may ordinarily be, is found completely inverted or everted, just as the squinting one was previously. From this very curious fact it would appear that the complaint depends upon an alteration, not in the texture or length of the muscle, but in its disposition to contract, or rather in the disposition to contract possessed by the two corre- sponding muscles, and consequently, that if advantage is to be derived from division of the muscle, that of either the straight or the squinting eye may be subjected to the operation. Another inference of practical value is, that in cases where complete relief has not been afforded by cutting the rectus of the squint- ing eye, the corresponding muscle of the other eye may be divided with advantage. In confirmation of the derangement depending rather upon functional than organic alteration, it may be added, that most persons labouring under the complaint re- mark that it varies in degree with a variety of circumstances, but especially disturbance of the digestive organs. A priori, there- fore, it might have been expected that division of the recti would^ not afford complete, or, at all events, permanent relief, since, iT the tendency to contraction remained, it would reinduce obliquity so soon as the muscle acquired new attachments to the sclerotic, just as has been ascertained to happen in the spasmodic form of wry-neck. Experience, however, having happily ascertained that the operation does in general prove effectual, the theoretical ob- jection must not stand in the way of its employment; but may account for the failures as well as relapses occasionally met with, and afford encouragement to repeat the ^ivision when it does not give all the relief desired at once. The operation essentially requires an opening of the conjunc- tiva sufficiently extensive to expose the insertion of the rectus in fault, and a complete division of the muscle at this part. Various methods have been recommended for effecting this, by the use of hooks for catching the muscle as it lies in the loose texture of the orbit; but the procedure consisting in a simple secure dissection of the part, without any hap-hazard diving, has always seemed to279 MUSCLES. me greatly preferable to any such uncertain and dangerous artifices. I have always, with the exception of some experi- mental trials in the early part of my experience, performed the operation in this way, with some little modification, and will now describe the mode of conducting it. The assistant should separate the eyelids by means of a speculum, and keep the eyeball everted by double-pointed hooked forceps. The first step is to raise a fold of the conjunctiva by means of the forceps applied close to the caruncle, and with the scissors cut it in a vertical direction to the extent of about half ah inch in the middle line between the forceps and hook. The attachment of the muscle, being then distinctly exposed, is divided by successively cutting with the scissors portions of it raised by the forceps, just as in dissecting this part in a dead body. The after-treatment requires no particular attention be- yond a moderately abstemious regimen,—avoiding bright light,— exercising the eyes equally,—and not employing them in reading or any minute work. At the end of ten days or a fortnight, if any obliquity is found to remain, or to have returned, it will be a Question, whether the rectus of the other eye should be divided, or the muscle already operated on should be cut a second time. In deciding as to this, I think the best guide is the effect pro- duced by closing the sound eye. If it is found to be altered in its ]3osition by doing so, and to present obliquity when suddenly exposed by opening the eyelids, the rectus concerned in produc- ing this effect may properly be divided. But if it remains straight, the operation should be repeated on the squinting eye, in the hope that the antagonist muscle, being afforded a second opportunity of contrac%ng, will do so more effectually than on the first occasion. In the course of two or three weeks after the operation, a warty-looking excrescence frequently grows from the seat of the wound, and requires to be cut away by dividing its neck, which is small and almost thread-like, with a pair of curved scissors ; or, to render this unnecessary, the nitrate of silver may be applied occasionally iintil the conjunctiva is completely healed. If left to itself, the growth, after gradually indurating, ultimately drops off from atrophy of the nutrient vessels.280 rRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. CHAPTEE XIV. TENDONS. Injuries of the Tendons. Wounds.—Tendons are sometimes divided by cutting-instru- ments, the immediate consequence of wliicli is loss of power of the muscles concerned. It was formerly the custom to sew the cut surfaces of the tendon together; but this practice is now abandoned, and the only means employed in addition to those which the wound of the integuments requires, consists in careful attention to the position of the limb, in order to relax the muscle connected with the injured tendon, and prevent as much as possible the separation of its extremities. When the tendon is of large size, such as the tendo A chillis, lateral compresses are useful in keeping the surfaces opposed to each other. It is ascertained that though the extremities remain considerably dis- tant, they are still united together through the medium of a new- formed substance, the result of an interstitial process of reproduc- tion. This part is sometimes thinner, sometimes thicker, than the original tendon, but always inconvenient by causing relaxation of the muscle, and consequent diminution in the effect of its con- tractile power. The surgeon, therefore, should do everything in his power to render the bond of union as^arrow as possible. In cases where the wound has been allowed to heal, with such sepa- ration of the extremities of the tendon as renders the patient lame, it may be warrantable to cut out the intermediate sub- stance, and sew the ends of the tendon together, as I once did with success in. a case where the tendo Achillis had been divided and allowed to heal with great retraction.* * Ed. Mccl. and Surg. Journal. Report of Surgical Cases, 1835.281 TENDONS. Rupture.—Tendons may be torn either by external violence, or by inordinate contraction of their own muscles. In the former case, they are most apt to give way where the muscular fibres are attached to them, and it not unfrequently happens that the tendons of the penniform muscles of the fingers or wrist are drawn out to the extent of five or six inches. It might be ex- pected that great irritation and diffused inflammation would result from such injuries, but the wound in general heals kindly, as if not complicated with any unusual peculiarity. It is a pradent precaution, however, to oppose the commencement of in- flammation by using cold applications in tlie first instance ; and if it should occur, incisions, together with warm fomentations, if the symptoms are violent, and the latter means alone if they are moderate, will be proper. When suppuration is established, com- pression along the course of the sinus, stimulating washes, and bandaging are required. Tendons are more frequently ruptured by the too energetic action of their muscles. The tendo Achillis is most liable to this accident, and, indeed, with the exception of the tendon of the extensors of the thigh, is almost the only one in which it occurs. It has been supposed that the thread-like tendon of the plantaris may be ruptured without a corresponding injury of the gxeat tendon of the ankle, and that such is the case where patients suddenly, after exertion, lose the power of extending the foot while no vacuity can be felt in the course of the tendo Achillis. But there can be little doubt that on such occasions the injury sustained is rupture of the muscular fibres, probably of the soleus. It is difficult to conceive that the loss of so smaU a power as that of the plantaris muscle should render the patient unable to move the ankle ; and the pain, discoloration, and tedious recovery which are usually obseiTcd to attend cases of the kind in question, are additional grounds for believing that the injury is seated in the muscular tissue. The tendo Achillis is usually ruptured in consequence of some sudden exertion in raising the body, or preventing it from falling. The patient feels a sensation as if struck with a blunt weapon. ItPRINCIPLES or SURGERY. 282 seems to him that his heel has sunlc into a hole, and a noise as of a cord giving way is occasionally heard, both by him and the by-standers. When the limb is examined, a hollow may be felt at the part where the tendon is torn, owing to the retraction of its extremities. The patient, by means of the deep-seated ex- tensors of the ankle, retains the power of extending the foot slightly when there is no resistance except its own weight, but cannot do so with any considerable force, such as is required in walking. Strong adult males are most subject to this accident. The treatment consists in bending the knee, and extending the ankle so as to relax the gastrocnemius as much as possible, applying lateral compresses at the injured part to keep the ends of the tendon in proper position, and supporting the hmb with a bandage. Various contrivances have been employed to maintain the requisite posture. Of these the slipper and calf-piece of Monro^ may be first mentioned. The calf-piece Dr. Monro compares to the aiiicle of dress which jockeys wear to connect their breeches and boots, differing only in so far that it is made to lace on, instead of being buttoned. By means of a strap and buckle, the heel of the slipper can be drawn up to this bandage and secured, so as to effect permanent extension of the ankle. Petit used a similar apparatus, with this difference, that the strap coming from the heel of the slipper was fastened to a collar surrounding the thigh above the knee, which had the advantage of keeping the knee bent, as well as the foot extended. This seems, on the whole, to be the best method, and an apparatus sufficiently effective for the purpose may be readily constructed extemporaneously, or a spHnt may be applied on the front of the ankle to keep the foot in an extended position. Compresses of lint should be placed on each side of the tendon at the ruptured part. In the course of three or four weeks the reunion is completed; but it does not be- come strong enough to resist much force until a considerably longer period has elapsed, during which the patient should be cautious in using the limb, and, as a precaution against straining the tendon, wear a liigh-heeled shoe.TKNDONS. 283 Infiammation and Sloughing of Tendons. The tendons, their fibrous sheaths, and also the fasciae which lie over them, are very readily deprived of vitality by inflamma- tion. This occurrence most frequently happens in the fingers and palm of the hand in what is called Paronychia or Whitlow. By this term is understood an intense inflammation, generally confined to one finger, but sometimes affecting several, and ex- tending into the palm of the hand, to which also it is occasion- ally limited. Though the swelling is generally on both sides, the principal seat of disease is almost always confined to the palmar aspect. The pain is agonising, the tension great, and the redness of the skin affected very bright. The inflammation extends to various depths, and leads to consequences of corresponding importance. Sometimes there is merely a collection of matter foimd under the thick skin of the part affected. More frequently, in addition to this, there is more or less sloughing of the ten- dinous structure, and not rarely death of the phalanges. The causes of paronychia are generally local irritations, but it is pro- bably necessary that their effect should be favoured by a state of the system predisposing to derangement. The only eff'ectual treatment consists in making a free incision through the tense and swollen parts. There is reason to believe, that if this were- done soon enough it would generally prevent the siibsequent suppuration and sloughing; but the opportunity of interposing thus early is seldom afforded, and the incision ig 'usually prac- tised to evacuate matter. Much mischief is often done by continued poulticing in such cases. Under this influence the matter is long of making its escape by ulcerative absorption, and the opening, when at last formed, is always too small for allow- ing free exit either to it or the tendinous sloughs. The iiTita- tion, therefore, is kept up, especially by the retained sloughs of the tendons, and the destruction of the tissues proceeds. There is no advantage in poulticing previous to incision, and though useful for a day or two afterwards in promoting the separation of the matter and sloughs, it ought not to be persisted in longer284 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. than this, as lotions with pressure are much more beneficial. When the tendons slough so extensively as to render the finger rigid and useless, amputation is the most prudent course ; and the patient will generally decide upon it after being made fully acquainted with the reasons for its performance. The distal phalanx often dies, along with a portion of the tendon, but the extremity of the finger ought not to be removed on this account, as it is of great consequence to preserve the secreting organ of the nail, which renders the finger, tliough shortened, little less useful or seemly than it was before. Ganglion. By Ganglion is understood a tiimour connected with a tendon, composed of a bag containing a glairy fluid, and varying in size from that of a pea to that of a pigeon's egg. There is a differ- ence of opinion as to the nature of ganglions, the question beiug whether they are entirely new formations, or merely develop- ments of the natural serous structure connected with the tendons. Though arguments might be adduced to support the former of these opinions, it seems on the whole more reasonable to adopt the latter. The bags vary greatly in thickness, and their contents are no less dissimilar in respect of consistence, being sometimes per- fectly watery, biit in general glairy like the white of eggs. The disease occurs most frequently at the wrist and ankle, the ex- tensor tendons of the fingers and toes being affected. Females are more liable to it than males. It seldom produces inconveni- ence, except from the deformity which it occasions, but some- times the patient complains of weakness in the limb. It is generally referred to over-exertion, but there is nothing certainly known as to the causes of its production. The most simple and effectual mode of treatment is to rup- ture the bag by pressure applied externally, and force its contents into the surrounding cellular texture. For this purpose some recommend that the ganglion should be struck a smai't blow with a book or similar body ; but this is a violent and uncer-285 TENDONS. tain metliod, and it is miicli better to exert a steady pressure on the tumour by means of botli thumbs acting in concert. To promote absorption, a compress and bandage should be applied for some days after the operation. If it should be found impos- sible to rupture the bag, owing to its strength, the best plan is to introduce a narrow sharp-edged instrument through the skin, and open the sac, after which its contents may be squeezed into the cellular substance, or discharged externally. The in- strument used for this purpose may be a common surgical needle, or a small tenotomy knife. To make the effect more certain, a blister ought to be applied immediately after the contents of the bag have been evacuated. Such being the different methods of treatment which will be found most effectual and sufficient for the remedy of the disease in all its forms, it would be use- less to detail the other measures which have been recommended, and are still occasionally employed. Of these, continued pres- sure, effected by means of a piece of money or similar solid compress fastened over the swelling, repeated blistering, in- unction of tartrate of antimony ointment, seton, incision, and excision, are the most deserving of notice, but, for the reason mentioned, need not be more particularly considered. BurscB Mucosa;. The Bursm Mucosce, like other serous structures, are subject to dropsical effusion. The exciting cause is usually some local irri- tation ; and when of an indirect kind, such as cold, its effect in producing the disease seems in general referable to a predisposi- tion of the system, depending on weakness or some peculiarity of constitution. If the membrane is merely distended, and has not suffered any thickening or alteration of structure, blistering, succeeded by pressure, may induce absorption of the fluid. If the sac is thick and indurated, these means often prove insuffi- cient, and it is found necessary to puncture the swelling, so as to let its contents escape, after which, a blister having been ap- plied, and followed by pressure, the radical cure is accomplished. Sometimes, along with the fluid, the sac contains a number ofPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 286 loose bodies, appearing to consist merely of indurated lympli. They are of a yellow or brownish colour, tough consistence, and variable size, from that of a millet-seed to that of a field bean. It is obviously necessary that, in such cases, the puncture must be large enough to let the bodies escape, after which the treat- ment ought to be conducted on the principles already explained. The lymph wliich is effused from the inner surface of the bursa sometimes becomes organized in the form of thick bands stretch- ing across the cavity. In such cases, after the means for pro- ducing absorption have been tried and failed, the disease must be removed by the knife. Bursse, whether in a sound state or one of chronic disease, are subject to acute inflammation in consequence of local irritation, especially that of bruises. The symptoms are severe pain, aggra- vated by pressure or motion, bright redness of the superjacent skin, and more or less swelling. The inflammation usually terminates either in resolution or effusion of lymph or serum, but sometimes goes on to suppuration. The surrounding cellular substance then also becomes inflamed, and a diffused abscess is the result. Leeches, warm fomentations, and lotions of acetate of lead with opium, are the best means for subduing the inflam- matory action, but when matter is formed, a free incision should be made without delay. After the suppuration of a bursa a troublesome sinus may remain, and harass the patient by fre- quent exacerbation of the symptoms. Free dilatation is for the most part sufficient in such cases ; but should it not prove to be so, the surface of the cavity must be touched with caustic. The particular bursse, which most frequently suffer the different diseased conditions that have been described, are those of the flexor tendons of the fingers, and those seated over the olecranon, patella, and ball of the great toe. In the first of these situations, the bursal sheaths, which accompany the flexor ten- dons of the fingers from the fore-arm into the hand, are liable to thickening of their texture, with distension, from effusion of fluid and the formation of moveable bodies, apparently composed of indurated lymph; the wrist and palm of the hand become287 TENDONS. greatly distended, and the patient loses the use of the limb until the disease is remedied. Although this condition does not materially differ from that of other bursal sacs, which, when so deranged, yield without much difficulty to remedial treatment, it has proved peculiarly obstinate under the means of remedy formerly in use, and indeed was regarded as nearly, if not alto- gether, incurable. Blisters, and similar applications, produced little or no beneficial effect, and puncturing the tumour where most prominent in the wrist or palm afforded no permanent advantage, as the wound either continued to discharge, or closed without obliteration of the cavity. The last patient treated thus in the Eoyal Infirmary died from the protracted local and con- stitutional disturbance so excited ; and this case led me to reflect seriously on the subject, in order to discover the cause of obstinacy, and devise a safer remedy. The only peculiarity that I could notice was the constriction caused by the annular ligament, above or below which the opening had always been made, and which might perhaps so interfere with the healing process as to occasion the obstinacy in question. In this view of the matter, it appeared that the proper site for an incision was at and through the ligamentous arch itseff. I took the earliest opportunity of trying the effect of such a procedure, which was so satisfactory as at once to estab- lish the operation. Its results in my own practice, and that of others, have, so far as I know, been uniformly successful. The easiest mode of operation is to puncture the swelling a little above or below the annular ligament, then introduce a blunt-pointed curved bistoury under the arch, and, lastly, divide it together with the superjacent integuments. Light and super- ficial dressing are sufficient in the first instance; and if the swelling does not speedily subside, one or two blisters may be applied. The superficial bursa lying over the olecranon is subject to irritation and acute inflammation from blows, but not unfre- quently suffers an accumulation of fluid with thickening of the membrane, and sometimes also with the formation of internalPRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. 288 crossing bands, from organization of effused lymph.. The bursa over the patella is very often distended with fluid, and thickened so as to constitute what is called Ganglion of the Knee. It is met with most frequently in persons whose occupation leads them often to rest their weight upon the laiee. The bursa over the ball of the great toe, when irritated by the pressure of a tight shoe, lays the foundation of that painful and unseemly swelling named Bunion. The parts adjacent become thickened and in- durated ; the bones of the joint enlarge, and in process of time suffer a sort of subluxation ; and the bursa being thus projected more and more against the shoe, is kept in a state of continual excitement. Dropsical effusion, thickening of the membrane, and suppuration with obstinate sinuses may ensue. It is there- fore proper, by the timely application of leecbes or lotions, and the removal of pressure, to subdue tbe disease in its infancy. Though the deep-seated bursas have long been well known to anatomists, and regarded by surgeons as the seat of morbid derangements, those wliich. lie superficially under the integu- ments are of comparatively late observation, and the swellings, as well as other local affections which proceed from their diseased condition, have been ascribed to entirely new forma- tions. In club-foot, for instance, the bursal sac, which in some measure protects the malleolus exicrnus when the weight of the body rests upon it, is not, as has been alleged, a production entirely the result of circumstances, but merely tbe development of a structure naturally belonging to this part. The superficial bursas seated over the joints of the fingei's and toes, of which views are given in the work of Schreger, though almost wholly overlooked, deserve great attention in consideration of the effects which attend their injuries and diseases.THROAT. 289 CHAPTEE XV. THEOAT. Wounds of the Throat. When self-destruction is attempted by cutting the throat, the wound is generally inflicted transversely near the os hyoides, some- times above, but more frequently below it. There is usually an extensive division of the integuments, which are occasionally the only parts injured—and when the injury penetrates deeply, it almost always extends into the pharynx. Sometimes an opening is made into the larynx, and in a few rare cases the trachea is cut, either alone or together with the oesophagus. The great blood-vessels are very seldom injured, from the force of the incision being spent in dividing the tough substance of the pharynx and air-passage, from the part of the throat which is chosen for the purpose, and from the position in which it is held, while the knife is applied. When they are opened, it is usually by a sharp-pointed knife being thrust directly down upon them. In considering the treatment of cut-throat, it is necessary to distinguish between—1. those cases in which an opening is made above the rima glottidis; 2. those in which it is below the rima glottidis, but does not extend to the oesophagus ; and, 3. those in which the oesophagus is wounded. When the aperture, as usually happens, is above the orifice of the larynx, the dangers to be dreaded, in the first instance, are the entrance of blood into the trachea during respiration, owing to its accumulation in the pharynx, and the escape of food through the wound during deglutition. To obviate the former of these, the cut edges should not. be brought together until the bleeding u290 PEINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY. from them has entirely or nearly ceased; and with the same view the patient should be made to lie on liis face or side, so as to favour the exit of fluids from the wound. If the injury of the pharynx is not very extensive, it will hardly be requisite to em- ploy any measures to assist the entrance of the food into the stomach, since the whole of what is attempted to be swallowed will not pass through the breach, and it is not to be desired that the diet should, for some days at least, exceed the limits of ex- treme moderation. But if the aperture is large, so as to admit one or more fingers, it will be prudent to introduce a tube, such as a flexible catheter, into the oesophagus, to serve as a channel for the conveyance of fluid articles. of nourishment, until the wound contracts sufficiently to render this unnecessary. The tube may be passed either by the nose or mouth, and also through the wound. When passed by the nose it may be allowed to re- main, and is not liable to displacement; but its introduction is extremely difficult, unless the surgeon takes advantage of the opening into the pharynx to direct the point of the instrument, which otherwise is apt to enter the rima glottidis, or engage itself in the lining membrane above the orifice of the oesophagus. When the tube, if judged necessary, has been introduced, and the hemorrhage is suppressed, the edges of the wound should be brought together by stitches, while the head is bent forwards, and retained in this position by a bandage or other means. The tube may be safely allowed to remain for several days ; but if retained during the whole period of healing, which may extend over many weeks, the irritation produced by its pressure, though perhaps not much felt by the patient, is apt to occasion ulceration of the mucous membrane, with abscess, or even exfohation of the car- tilages. After the first week, therefore, nourishment should be afforded either by the power of deglutition still possessed, or by the temporary introduction of a tube into the CESophagus thi'ough the mouth. When there is a wound into the air-passage alone, a tube is not reqiiired, unless the breach in the larynx or trachea is so large as to make it desirable to prevent the action of swallowing,THEOAT. 291 in order to guard against displacement of the edges of the wound. If the preternatural aperture is allowed to remain open, the rima glottidis has a tendency to contract, and even to close altogether. It may be possible, when such obliteration or straitening has occun'ed, to widen the passage sufficiently for the performance of its of&ce by introducing bougies from below upwards; but such a procedure is extremely difficult and uncer- tain, and the necessity for having recourse to it should there- fore be avoided by carefully promoting early closure of the wound. In cases where the oesophagus is cut, the patient must be fed through a tube, unless the opening in the coats of the canal should be so small as to render this unnecessary. The medical treatment of cut-throat is always extremely im- portant. There is generally great cerebral excitement,—the de- sire for self-destruction frequently continues in operation,—and the profuse hemorrhage which sometimes happens exposes the patient to the danger of excessive reaction. It should be recol- lected also, that the irritation of the wound may occasion swell- ing of the pharynx, and other deep-seated parts of the throat, adverse to free respiration, and may lead to bronchitis, more or less acute. Every source of bodily or mental excitement must therefore be strictly guarded against, while bleeding, counter- irritation, opiates, and antimony, are employed according to cir- cumstances. And whenever it seems, from the efforts of the patient or the sound of his respiration, that the ^air does not obtain a sufficiently free entrance, an opening into the trachea should be effected without delay. Tracheotomy and Laryngoiomy. These titles are used to express operations, of which the object is to admit air into the lungs, when the natural passage is obstructed, or to extract foreign bodies that have entered it. The diseases chiefly productive of obstruction are croup, cedema glottidis, and ulceration of the larynx. The membranous crust, which is effused in croup, and occasions the diminution of the292 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, air-passage, is generally of great extent, stretching from tlie larynx down the trachea into the bronchial tubes, and is so rarely limited within those bounds below which an aperture can be made, that an operation in this case must be regarded as only proper in almost desperate circumstances. (Edema glottidis, though not a very uncommon affection, is now so well Imown to the profession, that any account of its symptoms or progress would here be equally uimecessary and out of place. It. is suffi- cient to observe, that in this case, the obstruction is nearly or altogether confined to the rima glottidis, the lips of which are thickened by infiltration of serous effusion, so as greatly to im- pede inspiration, though they still allow of expiration being per- formed with moderate facility; and that, consequently there is' ample space below for making an opening to admit the air. M, Bayle's judicious observation, however, ought not to be forgotten, tliat if the operation is delayed until the disease has advanced so far as to occasion repeated threatenings of suffocation, it will hardly prove successful, owing to the excessive secretion of mucus which is induced by the continued irritation and dysp- noea. As soon, therefore, as the nature of the patient's com- plaint is distinctly ascertained, he ought to be impressed with the propriety and necessity of having the aperture made without loss of time. Ulceration of the larynx does not often impede respiration, though it deprives the patient of his voice, and occa- sions many other distressing symptoms. But sometimes the breathing in such cases suddenly becomes extremely difficult, and the danger of instant dissolution demands surgical inter- ference, though there may not be the slightest prospect of per- manent recovery, or of any advantage more than a few weeks', or • even only days', longer existence. The operation may be performed anywhere between the thyroid cartilage and sternum; but convenience and safety limit the choice more narrowly. The space between the th}T?oid and cricoid cartilages, though covered with little besides the integu- ments, and so far favourable for the purpose, is objectionable in general on the ground of its proximity to the disease, and alwaysTHEOAT. 293 on account of the difficulty wliicli has been experienced in ob- taining here a sufficiently large aperture without encroaching on the cartilages of the larynx. In opening the trachea near the sternum, the depth of the tube, which retreats backwards as it descends,—^the presence of the thyroid veins in the line of inci- sion, or even occasionally of the thyroidea ima artery,—and the transverse portion or isthmus of the thyroid gland, which often, especially in females and children, leaves hardly any accessible space below its inferior margin, are obstacles of no inconsiderable importance. The most convenient situation seems to be imme- diately below the cricoid cartilage. A sufficient portion of the trachea is here often left uncovered, and what more room is required may be gained by turning aside or dividing a little of the glandular substance. The bleeding from it should be allowed to cease before the trachea is opened. In performing the operation, there are required a scalpel, a couple of hooks, a sponge, and a tube of the flattened conical and slightly curved form, which has been found most convenient for the purpose, and of a size suited to the age of "the patient. It is well also to be provided with forceps and ligatures, in case of meeting with any arteries unusually large or irregularly distri- buted. The patient should be seated on a chair with his head bent back, and rested on the breast of an assistant. An incision, about an inch and a half long, is made as nearly as possible in the mesial line. The space between the sterno-hyoid muscles is recognised by its white appearance, and opened with the knife. The operator then feels for the lower margin of the cricoid carti- lage, or the trachea, and cuts down upon its rings, the surface of which having been exposed, serves as a guide for bringing into view what further space is reqviired for the opening, which should be about half an iiich long; and is readily effected by pushing in the loiife, while an assistant holds aside the muscles with a hook in each hand. Before wounding the trachea it is proper to wait a little until the arterial bleeding lias nearly ceased, or has been suppressed by ligature, should such means be required, wliich is seldom the case. But as the obstructedPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 294 respiration, which renders tlie operation necessary, impedes the venous blood in returning to the heart, the surgeon should not delay opening the trachea on account of dark-coloured bleeding. A violent access of coughing follows the introduction of the tube, which is useful in ejecting the acciimulated mucus, and any blood that may have entered; but the patient soon becomes accustomed to the unusual irritation, and respiration is performed without any uneasiness. The viscid tenacious mucus, which is usually secreted very copiously in cases requiring the operation, is apt to obstruct the tube, whence the necessity of employing one at first of a larger size than would be sufficient merely to admit the air, and of clearing it from time to time by means of a probe wrapped round with lint. The tube must be retained in its place by means of tapes passed through rings at its mouth, and tied behind the neck. It should be taken out and washed daily, as long as there continues to be occasion for its use; and it will be prudent to cover the orifice with gauze, to prevent the entrance of injurious matters from without. Foreign bodies are veiy seldom admitted through the rima glottidis; but as the accident, when it does occur, is attended with very distressing and dangerous consequences, great care ought to be taken lest it be overlooked. When it is learned that the patient, while in his ordinary health, in performing the action of deglutition, or, if a child, in playing with some small foreign body in liis mouth, was all at once seized with a violent cough, which has continued to recur in paroxysms with variable intervals, although no other symptom of local inflammation or constitutional disturbance can be perceived, the presumption will be strong that this accident has happened ; and if the sensa- tion of something moving in the trachea should also be felt, there can remain little room for doubting that a foreign sub- stance has entered the air passage. If it is of heavy material, as a piece of money, relief may be obtained by inverting the body. It has also occasionally happened that a violent cough proved the means of cure by ejecting the foreign body through the glottis, but no reliance can be placed on this rare chance ;295 THROAT. and the danger of suffocation, continued irritation, or suppura- tion of the lungs, fully warrants recourse to tracheotomy. When the operation is performed with this view, it should be conducted in the same way that has been described, with the ex- ception that, instead of a tube being introduced into the trachea, the edges of the opening are held asunder by a couple of hooks, until the source of irritation is expelled by the forcible stream of air which it occasions. Should the bit of bone, pea, nut, or whatever may have entered, not appear at the orifice, a pair of curved forceps may be introduced upwards to search the larynx, and, if necessary, the cricoid cartilage should be divided to afford more room for this purpose. The forceps may also be directed downwards if there is reason to suspect that the foreign body is impacted in one of the bronchi, of wliich the right one, as being the larger, and more directly in the course of the trachea, will be more likely to contain it. In cases of urgency, either from the presence of a foreign body, or sudden swelling of the parts concerned, though the proper apparatus for performing tracheotomy cannot be procured, the patient should not be permitted to die of suffocation. A penlmife being thrust into the space between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, as near as possible to the former, and carried down so as to divide the latter, will afford a sufficient aperture, the edges of which may be kept apart by a thin bit of wood, or the expanded branches of a small pair of forceps. Removal of Foreign Bodies from the Pharynx and (Esophagus. The detention of matters, in passing from the mouth towards the stomach, is owing either to their size or their figure. If pre- vented from descending on account of their bulk merely, they are generally arrested at tlie commencement of the oesophagus, just behind the cricoid cartQage,—since, this being the narrowest part of the tube, if not impacted more or less firmly into its orifice, they are expeUed either upwards or downwards, by the contractile action of the pharynx,—and if fairly introduced intoPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 296 the canal, tliey have their descent favoured by its increasing width. When, again, the foreign body is small and sharp-pointed, as a pin, needle, or fish-bone, it is usually entangled about the arches of the palate or the neighbourhood of the epiglottis, often stretching across the cavity. And shovdd it be impeded partly by figure, partly by bulk,—in other words, should it be small enough to pass readily into the oesophagus, if not prevented by its rigidity or angular form,—the bottom of the pharynx and commencement of the oesophagus are the situations where it is generally found. In the case of a tough digestible mass impacted in the oeso- phagus, the usual method of affording, relief is to push it doM'n with a probang—i. e. a piece of whalebone with a sponge or ball of ivory fastened to its extremity. The patient's head should be held back, and the whalebone must be slightly curved to assist its taking the proper direction, which is further promoted by holding the larynx forwards. Instead of this method, I prefer extracting the obstnicting substance, which may in general be easily effected by means of long curved forceps. If the foreign body is of a hard substance, which might occasion inconvenience if swallowed, and more especially if it possesses an angular form, which might render its more firm lodgment the consequence of force being employed to push it down, the safest course is to induce vomiting, in order to effect ejectment upwards. Where the passage was so completely obstructed as to prevent the swallowing of an emetic for this purpose, a solution of tartrate of antimony has been injected into the veins ; but such means are quite xinuecessaiy, as irritation of the fauces by a feather or the point of the finger is sufficient to induce the most violent expul- sive efforts, emptying the stomach of its contents, which carry out the foreign body along with them. In removing pins, needles, and such sort of things, the best plan is to ascertain their situation by means of the finger, and then extract them with the curved forceps. Patients frequently apply for assist- ance days or weeks after swallowing some pointed body, which they believe still remains fixed in the throat. If nothing can be297 THKOAT. felt with, the fingers, it is most probable that the patient's feeKng is deceptive, proceeding from imagination alone, or some irrita- tion of the throat, and not dependent upon the actual presence of the foreign body, which may have descended or been ejected. And even should it be actually detained in the oesophagus, it would be safer to trust its removal to the ulcerative process, which wni soon be excited by its pressure on the tissues concerned, than to persevere in fishing for it with any of the ingenious but in- effective contrivances that have been devised for the purpose. (Esophagotomy. The object of this operation is, to make an opening into the oesophagus, or lower part of the pharynx, to extract a foreign body that cannot be removed otherwise; but such a circum- stance happens so rarely that there are few instances of a surgeon being called upon in the whole course of his practice to perform the operation. Upon two occasions I have cut into the throat for the removal of a piece of bone which had passed through the coats of the oesophagus and caused deep-seated suppuration. In a third case I performed oesophagotomy for the extraction of a copper coin (Swedish penny), which had been impacted for more than two months in the cesophagus, opposite the upper bone of the sternum. All the patients were com- pletely and permanently relieved. The patient should be laid reclining, with the head bent backwards, and to the right side. An incision about two inches and a half in length is then to be made in the middle of the triangular hollow at the upper part of the neck, which is bounded below by the sterno-mastoid and sterno-hyoid muscles. It should extend from the upper margin of the thyroid to a little below the cricoid cartilage. The platysma myoides and fascia of the neck having been successively divided, the sheath of the vessels will come into view, and the surgeon then making an assistant press the larynx to the right side, dissects inwards to the pharynx, avoiding, if possible, the superior thyroid artery, and tying it if cut, until he feels the foreign body through the coats of the tube,298 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. or an ivory ball probang introduced by the mouth so as to dis- tend them. He finally opens the oesophagus, and with his finger, or curved forceps, removes the body of which he is in search. Stricture of the (Esophagus. The oesophagus is subject to three different kinds of stricture; one depending on inordinate contraction of the muscular fibres ; a second consisting in a simple constriction and thickening of the mucous membrane ; and a third caused by degeneration of the coats of the tube, which, becoming the seat of a tumour, render the canal narrow and tortuous. The first, or spasmodic stricture is met with chiefly in young or middle-aged persons ; particularly those of a nervous habit, or disposed to hysterical complaints, or who have suffered much from mental distress. It is recognised by the difficulty which is experienced in swallowing, and by a disagreeable sensation of constriction in the throat. The remedy consists in administer- ing anti-spasmodic medicines, such as the tincture of valerian; correcting any irregularities that may be discovered in the per- formance of the various secretions ; and, if necessary, passing a full-sized bougie into the oesophagus, which sometimes at once completely removes the unpleasant feelings of the patient. Similar symptoms are sometimes produced by an opposite or paralytic state of the muscles of deglutition; in which case, if the patient survives the derangement of the nervous system that primarily occasions this d3'sphagia, food mu^t be sup- plied through a tube introduced from time to time into the oesophagus. The second, or simple organic stricture, as it may be named, occurs chiefly at the commencement of the oesophagus, opposite the cricoid cartilage ; and for the most part in people of advanced age. The contracted part is usually of small extent, seeming as if it were caused by drawing a thread round the tube, and exists in various degrees of width, from that of a small quill upwards. The circumstances which occasion this morbid state have not been well ascertained. When irritating or escharotic fluids, suchTHROAT. 299 as the diluted mineral acids, or strong alkaline solutions, are in- troduced into the oesophagus, the usual consequence, in case the patient survives, is thickening and contraction of its coats. And it may reasonably be imagined that the change in qu.estion is produced by similar causes operating on a smaller scale; but the patient can hardly ever refer the origin of his complaint to any particular irritation from stimulating food or other source. The symptoms of this disease generally manifest themselves very insidiously. The swallowing of large morsels becomes difficult and painful; the food is more carefully masticated than before; and as the contraction increases, while none but very small portions of solid matter can be got down, even they in passing the stricture occasion pain, which is felt shooting into the back of the neck and shoulders. From the frequent recur- rence of this distressing sensation, and the dread of exciting it, the patient's countenance acquires a very characteristic expres- sion of anxiety; which, together with the emaciation that results from deficient supply of nourishment, is almost sufficient to betray the nature of the case to an experienced practitioner. It may be added, that the voice is peculiar, sounding as if the person spoke with a foreign body in his throat; that there is no swelling to be perceived by external examination; and that, though there is frequent spitting of saliva, no blood is discharged. But the only method of positively ascertaining the existence, seat, and degree of stricture, is to introduce a succession of bougies, gradually decreased in size from that which ought to enter the oesophagus readily, if it were sound, down to that which the constriction is capable of admitting. The treatment of this kind of stricture has been conducted on two principles:—one of them being to apply caustic, with the view of destroying the thickened or contracted part of the membrane; and the other to produce a gradual dilatation of it by means of bougies. The former of these methods, though supported by the strong recommendation of Sir E. Home and other authorities, labours under the objection of being painful, difficult, and attended with great danger of injury to the neigh-PRINCIPLES OP SURGERY. 300 bouring parts ; wliile the latter is not only in a great measure free from these defects, but proves much more speedy in its operation. The bougies may be constructed either of elastic gum or of steel. If of the second kind, they ought to be a little curved, and have their extremity made slightly bulbous, as this enables the operator to feel more distinctly when it has passed the stricture. The effect of bougies in removing strictures of mucous canals is not, as was formerly supposed, merely mecha- nical. This no doubt is the first effect; but another very im- portant one follows, which is the action of absoi-ption, induced by the pressure of the instrument. The organizable matter effused into the coats of the gullet, causing their contraction and thickening, is thus gradually removed. But if the bougies be passed with undue force, or too frequently, or be retained too long, the effect, instead of being absorption, is apt to be effusion, the consequence of which is an aggravation of the disease. The bougies, therefore, should be immediately withdrawn after being passed through the stricture; and the operation ought not to be repeated until the irritation of the previous one has entirely Subsided, which usually requires an interval of two or three days. Great care must be taken to avoid maldng a false passage for the instrument, which, if improperly directed, or urged with undue force, may be readily pushed into the posterior mediastinum, or elsewhere through the coats of the canal. In this case the action of deglutition tends to propel foreign matters into the new aperture, instead of the strictured oesophagus, and speedy death is the almost inevitable consequence. The third kind of stricture, or that which depends on morbid degeneration of the oesophagus, causing a tumour in its coats, and which may be named the malignant or carcinomatous stricture, is met with chiefly in persons beyond the middle period of life. It usually occurs at the ordinary situation of other strictures, that is, behind the cricoid cartilage ; but sometimes takes place lower down, near the cardiac extremity of the tube. The symptoms are- those of simple stricture, together with those attendant on morbid formations of the kind in question. The301 THEOAT. patient feels lancinating pain, more or less constant and severe, in the part affected. A tumour can often be perceived by exter- nal examination of tbe throat. There is occasionally a bloody, foul discharge; and the patient's countenance acquires that greenish-yellow complexion which characterises a system labour- ing under malignant disease. As it is evidently impossible to effect excision of the tumour, the disease must be regarded as truly incurable; and any attempts with caustic, or the simple bougie, instituted either from misapprehension of the nature of the case, or an ill-grounded expectation of promoting absorption of the morbid structure, must prove injurious by increasing the patient's sufferings, and hastening the progress of the disease. This kind of strictiire, as well as the one depending on simple contraction, is simulated by malignant disease of the stomach, which therefore requires to be carefully discriminated. This is best done by passing a moderate-sized bougie. Bronchocele. ■ By Bronchocele is understood a tumour depending on enlarge- ment of the thyroid gland. The morbid growth is usually most akin to the simple sarcoma; but sometimes consists, partly or entirely, of cysts, and has also been found to present cerebriform characters. The swelling varies in size, from the slightest per- ceptible degree of fulness, to a magnitude that occupies nearly the whole space between the chin and sternum; and extends forwards as well as laterally in large round irregular projections. Its consistence is soft and elastic, and a section of it exhibits a yellowish granular structure. The vessels are generally very much enlarged, in proportion to the size of the tumour, whence incisions into its substance during life are attended with profuse hemoiThage. Sometimes the whole gland is equally enlarged, but it generally exceeds on one side; and occasionally the swelling is entirely limited to the right or left lobe—particularly the latter. In this case the surgeon must be upon his guard against supposing that the disease is an aneurism of the carotid artery, or an independent tumour admitting of excision, whichPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 302 opinion he may be led to adopt by tbe seeming mobility of the growth, owing to the flexibility of its substance. Bronchocele is observed to abound chiefly in certain districts, which are mostly of a mountainous Idnd, where it may be associated with mental imbecility. The frequency of bronchocele in such regions has not yet been satisfactorily explained. It has been attributed to the use of snow-water, the violent exertions required by the in- habitants in cKmbing precipitous paths, which, it has been alleged, must expose them to frequent venous congestion, and to the prevalence of a damp atmosphere, in the misty valleys and ravines, which has been supposed likely to promote the growth of glandular swellings. In the countries where the disease is not endemic, it is almost entirely confined to females, generally commencing in youth or before middle age, and affecting chiefly the labouring classes. The symptoms of bronchocele are swelling in the situation of the thyroid gland, which follows the motions of the larynx during deglutition, and cannot be moved without a corresponding dis- placement of it. There is seldom much obstruction either, of breathing or swallowing, owing to the resistance which is made by the cartilaginous structure of the air-passages, and the protection from pressure which the trachea affords to the oeso- phagus. Headache, however, not uufrequently results from the obstruction which the blood meets with in returning from the head through the jugular veins; and the patient occasionally complains of more or less uneasiness in the tumour itself. But, for the most part, the principal inconvenience sustained depends simply upon the bulk and weight of the enlargement; and after attaining a certain size, it usually ceases to increase. The deep situation, muscular coverings, firm connections, and large blood-vessels of bronchocele forbid excision; and the attempts which have been made with this view afford a sufficient warning against their repetition, by the fatal issue that has almost invariably, and often immediately, foUowed them. The ligature of the superior thyroid arteries, which, though previously proposed by others, was first executed by Sir W. Blizard, does303 THEOAT. not seem deserving of adoption. The operation has been some- times found extremely difficult, owiug to the displacement and overlapping of the vessels by the tumour—it has even proved fatal, by giving rise to extensive ulceration—it has rarely or never effected an entire removal of the swelling—and has generally iaduced only a very partial absorption. The plan of passing a seton through the tumour, in order to excite suppura- tion, and a consequent diminution of bulk, which was brought into notice by Quadri of Naples (1818), but had been proposed and even practised previously, is easily executed, and seldom leads to any serious bad consequences. Fatal cases, however, have been observed by Chelius and others, in consequence of the centre of the tuinour entering into a profuse suppuration, while the rigidity of the parietes prevented their contraction, so as to diminish the size of the cavity; and the good effects of the practice have been at best but of partial extent. Except, there- fore, ia cases where circumstances render it very desirable to reduce the size of the swelling, there seems to be little encourage- ment to employ the seton. If it is thought proper to do so, a skein of silk or cotton should be conveyed through the anterior part of the tumour where there is no danger of woundiug the large arteries; compresses if necessary are then to be applied over the orifices, and fomentations with poultices must be em- ployed afterwards, if required by the occurrence of inflammatory consequences. When suppuration commences, the seton may be changed, and when the tumour ceases to diminish, it may be withdrawn altogether. Incisions into the tumour, and the appli- cation of caustic to it, which act on the same principle as the seton, are less eligible means, inasmuch as they are more severe in their administration, and not so efficient. Mr. Listen em- ployed the ligature with success, previously dissecting the integuments of the projecting part of the tumour, and then transfixing its base ; and I once adopted this method in the case of a lady who had a lobe of the thyroid enlarged into a round tumour with such a narrow neck as to appear altogether insulated.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 304 With the exception of those cases where some energetic interference is peremptorily required, which are fortunately rare, the best treatment for bronchocele is to bhster the surface, and apply ointments, containing iodide alone, or in combination with mercury. Ever since Dr. Coindet of Geneva introduced the use of this medicine to promote absorption (1820), it has been very generally employed both internally and externally for this purpose, wliile the internal ^^se of burnt sponge, which was formerly considered the grand specific for bronchocele, has gone into disuse since iodine came to be regarded as its active prin- ciple in exciting the action of the absorbents. But for my own part I regard the blisters as productive of nearly if not all the benefit; and therefore use them without any other means or treatment. When the case ceases to improve, or is obstinate from the commencement, the patient should be dissuaded from subjecting himself to any more severe expedients unless his existence should be threatened or rendered seriously uncom- fortable by the presence of the swelling. The headache, which occasionally proves a distressing attendant of the disease, is sometimes much alleviated by the application of a few leeches to the temples from time to time. When the enlargement is found to depend on the presence of a cyst it should be punctured, and injected with tincture of iodine, as in the case of hydrocele.THORAX. 305 CHAPTER XVI. THOEAX. Wounds of the Thorax. SUPEEFICIAL wounds of the thorax which do not penetrate the cavity require merely ordinary treatment. Muscular bruises occur very frequently, and often occasion so much uneasiness in res^Di- ration as to simulate inflammation, and induce the practitioner to employ copious and repeated depletion, which can do no good, and may prove very hurtful by inducing the spnptoms of exces- sive reaction. The state of the pulse in such cases, if attended to, will prevent this injudicious practice, instead of which the injiu'ed muscles should be restrained from motion by encircling the chest with a broad bandage. Penetrating wounds are attended with various important effects, the mode of production and treatment of which should be familiar to the practitioner, who on such occasions is called upon to act without delay on the knowledge he happens to possess. If air be admitted through the aperture, as it must almost necessarily be to a more or less extent, the lung of the side affected, unless adherent to the parietes of the cavity, contracts itself, owing to the elasticity of the pulmonary tissue, which is thus placed in equilibrio as to the pressiu^e of the atmosphere. If only a small quantity of air has been allowed to enter before the woimd is closed, the contraction of the lung will be pro- portionally inconsiderable. But if the wound remains open unto, the contractile tendency of the lung exerts its full effect, respiration, so far as that half of the pulmonary apparatus is con- cerned, will be completely suspended. The patient then feels XPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 300 great oppression in the chest; his cheeks become purple, owing to the imperfect oxygenation of the blood; his extremities are cold; his pulse frequent, small, and irregular; and if proper measures are not employed for his relief, death may ensue from congestion of the sound lung, or from the inflammation which results from this state. In cases of recovery, the wound of the thoracic parietes heals, and then the air which had been admitted into the cavity of the plem-a is absorbed, so that the lung is forced to expand, and performs its function as before the injury. In conducting the treatment of a simple penetrating wound, it should be recollected that the danger consequent upon the injiuy proceeds from inflammation of the pleura, caused by the wound, or by oppression of the sound hmg. The practice thus suggested consists in protecting the patient from aU sources of bodily and mental agitation, and diminishing the quantity of blood in the system so as to lighten the labour of the weakened organ. With these views, the thorax should be surrounded with a broad bandage,—the horizontal posture, and strict antiphlo- gistic regimen, should be enjoined,—and blood should be taken from the arm in quantity proportioned to the strength of the patient, but so largely as to relieve, if not remove altogether, the sense of oppression which is felt about the breast, after whioli antimonials and opiates must be diligently emplo^'^ed to moderate the force of the circulation, supersede the necessity of further depletion, and lessen the risk of excessive reaction from what has been already employed. When a wound of the thorax not only penetrates the cavity, but also extends into the substance of the lung, the consequences are still more important, since, in addition to those that occur in the former case, there are the dangers which attend hemon-hage into the cavity of the pleura, and into the bronchial tubes of the sound lung. The injury is generally recognised by bloody expec- toration, and a discharge of blood or bloody froth from the wound. But it must be recollected, that, though neither of these indications be observable, a wound of the lung may exist, and even be productive of a copious bleeding into the cavity of the cliest.307 THORAX. The same objects of treatment exist here as in the case of a simple penetrating wound, hut should lead to a practice still more decided and careful, as the danger must always be regarded as more serious. The circumstance of internal hemorrhage de- mands additional consideration, and has afforded fruitful subject of discussion in respect to the mode of preventing and remedying it, and also as to the diagnostic marks of its presence. Some recommend the external wound to be closed immediately, in order to retain the blood, and limit the extent of its effusion by effecting pressure on the breach of the lung. It is true that the fluid thus accumulated may be removed by subsequent absorp- tion, without causing any trouble to the patient; but experience has ascertained, that, instead of this salutary process, the irrita- tion of its presence is more apt to excite a fatal inflammation, and there seems little inducement to incur this risk when the alleged advantage of the practice is fairly weighed. When the lung is wounded it must suffer a complete contraction, since the air, though not allowed to enter by the external wound in suffi- cient quantity to occupy the space required for its entire collapse, will find a ready entrance from the branches of the trachea which are wounded; and the external surface of the Itmg being thus maintained permanently in equilibrio with the internal one as to the pressure of the atmosphere, the elasticity of the organ will meet with no obstacle to the exercise of its contractile tendency. The cavity for the reception of the blood must therefore be very capacious; and when the yielding nature of its parietes towards the diaphragm and the other side of the chest is taken into account, it seems dif&cult to conceive the possibility of making effectual pressure on the cut surface of the lung by retaining the flui d. For these reasons, it appears to be the more prudent practice to afibrd free exit to the blood, by keeping the original wound open, or making a new one in a more convenient situation, while by bleeding from the arm, and the other means that promote the cessation of hemorrhage by inducing coagulation in the wounded vessels, the further flow of blood from the lung is restrained.PEINCITLES OF SURGERY. 308 If tlie wound of the parietes is small, or near the upper part of the chest, internal hemorrhage may take place to a great extent without any external indication of its existence, especially if, as sometimes, but very rarely, happens, it should proceed from one of the intercostal arteries. Various symptoms of blood accumulating in the chest have been observed and carefully described as affording the means of recognising it. Of these the most important are, coldness of the extremities—clammy per- spiration of the face—a purple colour of the cheek on the side affected—inability of lying on the sound side of the 'body, which is probably the cause of the precediag symptom—extreme oj)pression of breathing—a small fluttering pulse—suppression of urine—and a want of the usual resonance when the affected side of the chest is subjected to percussion. As all these signs, and also those more questionable ones which have not been thought deserving of mention, whether taken together or sepa- rately, must be regarded as insufficient to yield positive proof on the subject, it is prudent in doubtful cases to open the wound in order to ascertain the truth. In consequence of wounds and fractures of the thorax, air is frequently injected into the cellular substance under the integu- ments of the chest, constituting what is called Emphysema, and in other cases it is accumtdated within the jDleura so as to distend the membrane, and compress the sound lung with distressing or even fatal effect. It is highly important to be acqoiainted with the circumstances on which these events depend, and the mode of preventing or remedying them. For the production of emphysema, it is requisite that there should be an aperture in the pleura costalis, to admit the air into the cellular substance, and the power which forces it to enter is always the contraction of the parietes of the thorax ; but there are two sources from which the air thus impelled may be derived. One of these is a simple jDcnetrating wound of the thoracic parietes, so nari'ow, or so shaped and situated, as to allow the air to enter the chest during inspiration, but oppose its free exit during ex- piration, permitting it to pass no further than through the pleura.309 THOEAX. The second is a wound of the lungs and fUwra costalis, existing without any outlet through the parietes of the chest, which may- be caused by the spicular extremity of a fractured rib, or may result from the healing of the skin while the breach in the lung and pleura remains open, in a case where both the parietes and limg have been wounded. When the air enters the cellular substance, it diffuses itself more or less extensively, and occa- sions a flat undefined swelling of the integuments, which is recognised by a crepitating or crackling sensation, that is felt on pressing it, and by the quick disappearance of dimples thus occasioned in its surface. The integuments of the whole body, except where the subjacent connections of the skin are very firm, as the pahns of the hands and soles of the feet, may be distended in this way; but universal emphysema is an extremely rare occurrence, its extent being usually limited to the side of the chest which has been injured. The treatment is simple and obvious, consisting in the application of a. .compress over the wounded part, to oppose the further issue of air from the cavity of the pleura, and, if necessary, in making punctures at different places, to discharge that which is contained in the cellular sub- stance ; but this should not be done unless the swelling is so great as to be productive of much inconvenience, since, if left to itself, it wiU soon be removed by absorption. Accumulation and confinement of air in the cavity of the pleura, or pneumothorax, as it is called, though less obvious to sight than emphysema, is a more distressing and dangerous occurrence. It gradually distends the membrane in which it is enclosed,—presses upon the pericardium and sound lung,—and may at length occupy so much of the thoracic cavity as not to leave sufficient space for the Iting of the sound side to perform its fimction. In this case, as has been already remarked, the air may either enter by an external wound, which is of such a valvular kind as to allow of its getting in when the chest is expanded during inspiration, but prevents its exit when the parietes of the cavity are drawn together during expiration ; or may pass into the pleura by a wound of the lung which existsPiUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. 310 witliout au external one,—the wound of the lung itself having necessarily a valvular effect, as the soft substance of the pulmo- nary tissue, though opposing no resistance to the escape of ait" from the small bronchial tubes, will prevent its return into them by collapsing round their cut orifices, when subjected to pressure during expiration. In either of these circumstances, every inspiration will tend to enlarge the quantity of au- contained in the pleura, while the succeeding expii'ation has little or no effect in reducing it. The patient consequently feels gi'eat and in- creasing difficulty of breathing. The inspirations are short, almost instantaneous, and effected with a sort of catch. The expirations are laborious and ineffectual; and there is a distress- ing sensation of tightness across the breast; the pulse is small and irregular; the countenance is livid; and unless relief be afforded, death ensues. The symptoms of this condition bear considerable resemblance to those of hemorrhage into the pleura, —^but the resonance of the chest, which is absent in the latter case, and more than usiially distinct in pneumothorax, dis- tinguishes the one from the other. If emphysema is present along with pneumothorax, scari- fications should be made for the discharge of the air contained in the cellular substance, which also afford exit to that accumu- lated in the chest; but if this proves insufficient, or if there is not any emphysema, an opening should be made without delay through the parietes of the thorax. Paracentesis thoracis, for this purpose, was first proposed by Mr. Hewson. Paracentesis Thoracis. Paracentesis, or puncture of the thorax, is performed to evacuate air, blood, pus, or serum, accumiilated to an injurious extent within the cavity of the pleura! It might appear at first sight that almost any part of the parietes could be chosen for this purpose,—but the follo\\dng considerations Mmit the proper boixnds of the operation to a more narrow space. An opening higher up than the fifth or sixth rib would not afford a con- venient outlet for the fluid which requires to be discharged,—311 THOKAX. and it could not be made lower tlian tlie ninth or tenth without incm-ring the danger of injuring the diaj)hragm. The intercostal spaces not thus interdicted are thickly covered with muscles for a third part of theu' extent at least, from both the sternal and vertebral extremities; and at these parts the intercostal arteries are more exposed to danger than m that which lies between the angles and the cartilages of the ribs. The principal vessel of each intercostal space rims along the lower edge of the superior rib, overlapped and protected by the sharp descending ridge of its external margin,—but a branch of the artery proceeds along the upper border of the lower rib,—and the safest place, conse- quently, for cutting through the parietes is equidistant between the two ribs that circumscribe the space selected for the opera- tion. It appears, on the whole, therefore, that the best situation for operating is between the fifth and eighth ribs on the right side, and the sixth and ninth on the left, where the presence of the pericardium renders it prudent to cut lower, at an equal distance from the sternum and spine, and in the middle of the space between the two ribs. The patient should be laid on a sofa, or brought to the edge of his bed, and be made to bend his body so as to ren- der the affected side of the chest as convex as possible. The surgeon then introduces a small trocar, without any prelimi- nary incision of the integuments, and withdraws the canula when the fluid has escaped. Diseases of the Mamma. The Mamma is liable to so many diseases that it is necessary to make a classification of them. They may be divided into— 1. Those in which there is merely derangement of its nutritive or sensitive action, caxising' simple enlargement, induration, and pain ; 2. Those in which there is a collection of purulent fluid ; 3. Those in which there is a morbid growth limited to the part in which it originates ; and, 4. Those in which the gi'owth is of a malignant kind—that is, tends to spread, ulcerate, or fungate, and affect the patient's constitution.312 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. The first of these divisions comprehends the painful indura- tions which occur at the time of puberty, and in the early months of pregnancy—also a more chronic condition of the same kind, not unfrequently met with in middle-aged women—and lastly, a painful state which is named the Irritable Breast. The second , division includes the Acute or Milk Abscess, as it is usually. / called, and the Chronic Abscess. The third division embraces Simple Sarcomatous, Fibrous, and Cystic Tumours ; and the fourth, those of the Carcinomatous, and Medullary or Cerebri- form kinds. In both sexes about the time of puberty the breasts frequently become enlarged, hard, and painful, but soon return to their ordinary condition, and seldom require any treatment further than the application of fomentations or some soothing lotion. This state of excitement, which attends the development of the sexual organs, is apt to occasion alarm, from being supposed to denote malignant action of the part, and, there is reason to fear, has even led to excision of the gland. Tlie same observations will apply to the painful and slightly swollen state of the breast which is observed at the commencement of pregnancy. Induration of the breast at a more advanced age is a very common effect either of slight direct irritations, as blows or bruises, or of the indirect irritation which proceeds from suppres- sion or derangement of the natural secretions. Women about the middle period of life, particularly those who are not married, or who have no children, are most liable to this complaint. It generally affects both breasts, but is sometimes h'mited to a lobe , ^ of one. The induration is not well defined. It does not feel ' very hard or heavy, and, if attended with pain, the patient de- scribes her uneasiness as a sort of burning sensation, which is not always equally severe, but varies much in this respect, according to the state of mind and body. The patient's appear- ance and time of life, the history of the tumour, its consistence, and the readiness with which it generally yields to proper treat- ment, distinguish this from more serious affections of the mamma. When the breast is particularly painful, leeches and warmTHORAX. 313 fomentations may be used with advantage, or a litharge plaster may be applied over it; but local treatment is to be regarded as of secondary importance, since the disease almost always depends upon the state of the general health, and is to be remedied by its improvement. With this view, any derangement of the intestinal or menstrual secretions, which is ascertained to exist, must be, if possible, rectified without delay; and then a gentle course of alterative medicine, especially the saline laxatives, used daily, with due attention to the mental condition of the patient, oxight to be carefully employed. The mamma sometimes becomes the seat of uneasy sensa- tions so distressing and unceasing as fully to warrant the appro- priation of a particular title to express them. The Irritable breast is generally met with in middle-aged women, of nervous disposition, who have been much exposed to grief, disappoint- ment, or anxiety. It is recognised by the extreme suffering of the patient, who represents the pain as equally intolerable and indescribable. It never leaves her entirely, but has remissions of partial relief, and exacerbations in which the agony is extreme. These paroxysms are induced by everything that directly or in- directly occasions excitement. Pressure, as that applied in examining the breast, agitation of mind, and derangement of the secretions, are the most certain means of producing this effect. When the patient submits to an examination of the painful part, it is felt to be a little fuller and denser than usual; sometimes engaging the whole gland, and at others being confined to a single lobe, or a stiU. smaller portion. In cases where the symptoms are mild, great or even complete relief is sometimes obtained from fomentations and other soothing local applications, together with the internal medicines requisite for restoring to a healthy state the secretions that may be deranged. If these means prove unavailing, and the patient suffers such distress that she insists upon the seat of the pain being removed, this wish must some- times be complied with in order to aUay the apprehension of malignant disease, which greatly aggravates the complaint by agitating the mind. The gland, when cut into, displays a some-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 314 what wliiter and denser structure than usual, and frequently also cysts of various size containing a limpid fluid. The opera- tion is usually followed by an interval of complete relief, and sometimes by a permanent cure, but the cicatrix or neighbouriiig parts are apt to become the seat of sensations similar to, though seldom so severe as, those pseviously experienced, and for which the same soothing means ought to be employed.' The milk abscess is a collection of purulent matter formed in the mamma during lactation. If, whUe the gland is in this active state, constitutional disturbance should be excited by ex- posure to cold, errors of diet, or any other circumstances, the fever thus induced is very apt to be attended with or followed by inflammation of the previously excited organ. The patient's first intimation of indisposition is a rigor, accompanied with pain of the back, and headache, which is soon succeeded by heat of skin, quickness of pulse, loading of the tongue, and flushing of the face. At the same time the breast becomes red, tense, and pain- ful, while the short but smart fever, or Weed, as it is vulgarly named, subsides in the course of twenty-four or forty-eight hours. In a few days, if the inflammation does not terminate in resolution, the fluctuation of fluid may be felt in the mamma ; and if the process is allowed to proceed naturally, the matter is evacuated by ulceration or sloughing of the integuments.- In treating this afiection it is usual to begin with the appli- cation of leeches ; but it does not appear that mUch advantage is'thus obtained. Warm fomentations externally, and saline purgatives, to promote the intestinal secretions, with gentle anti- monial draughts, to produce a similar effect on the skin, ought to be employed in the first instance, as being the most efiicient means for inducing resolution of the inflammatory action. If it goes on to suppuration, poultices should be substituted for the fomentations, and the patient must observe a restricted regimen to moderate the flow of blood towards the breast. The cavity of the abscess generally heals sooner when evacuation of the matter is not hastened by using the knife, before the suppuration is so far completed that the thin superjacent integuments project orTHOEAX. 315 point Wlien the process is tlius far advanced, a free incision should be made, since it will not then delay the subsequent process of cure, but accelerate it by preventiag extensive ulcera- tion, sloughing, or the formation of sinuses. After the matter has been discharged, a poultice is useful for a few days; and then simple dressing, succeeded by some gently stimulating lotion, may be used to dress the sore until it is completely healed. The chroijic abscess forms insidiously without any observable symptoms of inflammation. It occurs at all periods of life, but is met with most frequently in middle-aged women. The size of the swelling is generally about that of an egg, its contents are usually thin, and it is for the most part deeply seated. The in- teguments being free from redness and tension, while the sub- stance of the gland, except in the neighbourhood of the part affected, where it is condensed and thickened, retains its natural consistence, the abscess is apt to be mistaken for a solid tumour ; and this error is in some cases confirmed by swelling of the axillary glands, which, taking place in consequence of the irrita- tion caused by the collection of fluid ia the mamma, or perhaps altogether independently of it, is regarded as evidence of malig- nant action propagated along the absorbents. The equality of the surface of the tumour when examined through the parts lying over it, the absence of pain when this is done, and the feeling of fluctuation that may then be more or less distinctly perceived, afford in general sufficient grounds for an accurate diagnosis ; and should there remain any doubt as to the nature of the swelling, it may be readily resolved by making a puncture, which will evacuate the fluid if there is any, and will do no harm if there is not, since in that case excision ought to be performed without delay. A free opening should be afforded to the matter, and the sides of the incision must be carefully kept separate to prevent their union, which is very apt to happen owing to the thickness of the parts. This operation is sometimes followed by considerable inflammation and constitutional disturbance, during the continuance of which, fomentations, with poixltices and suit-PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. 316 able remedies of a general kind, are to be employed according to circumstances. If necessary, more free dilatation, and stimulating washes, with an alterative course of medicine and diet to improve the patient's health, may afterwards be had recourse to. As a consequence both of this and the former kind of abscess having been improperly treated, there fi-equently remain sinuses of great extent, seated very deep between the mamma and pec- toral muscle, and running through the substance of the gland in various directions. A copious thin sero-purulent discharge issues from the orifices, which are generally numerous, and the whole breast becomes hard, and immovably attached through indura- tion and adhesion of the muscular, cellular, glandular, and cutaneous tissues. The appearances presented by the disease are then so alarming, to one not acquainted with the nature of the case, that excision of the affected parts might very readily be thought of, and, there is reason to believe, has even been executed. Mr. Hey of Leeds proposed, as a substitute for re- moval, the free incision of aU the sinuses, so as to lay them fairly open, however numerous and deep, even though it should be necessary in doing this to divide, or even insulate, portions of the gland. This severe practice is not necessary, since ex- perience has shewn, that merely enlarging moderately with the knife the orifices of the more dependent sinuses is suffi- cient for the'purpose. y^^'Q.e-i U'^*^ Simple Sarcoma. "* Simple sarcoma, or hypertrophy of the mamma, seldom occurs to such an extent as to constitute what may be regarded as a disease, since enlargement of the breast is generally owing much more to redundance of the adipose tissue than the size of the gland. Occasionally, however, the mamma does suffer a morbid increase, and may attain such dimensions as to become an insufferable load to the patient. Cases are recorded in which tumours of this kind were found after removal to weigh many pounds ; and if the tumour continues to enlarge, or is the causeTHOKAX. 317 of intolerable oppression to the patient, there can be no doubt as to the propriety of removing it. Fibrous Sarcoma. This tumour is not like the one last mentioned, merely an enlargement of the mammary substance, but a distinct new formation. It possesses a fibrous structure of variable density, from that of fibre cartdage to the consistence of a salivary gland; its colour is generally white, or grayish-yellow; its figure is usually round, or oval, with an irregularly-nodulated surface of a glistening appearance. When small, it is extremely movable, and seems, upon examination through the integuments, as if it could be pushed about from one part of the breast to another. As it enlarges, the gland, being subjected to pressure, suffers a progressive diminution of size, until at length so little trace of it may be left as even to require a search for its discovery. This kind of tumour is generally met with in unmarried women between the ages of twenty and forty. It grows with very different degrees of rapidity, sometimes remaining for years no larger than a walnut, and at others in the same period attaining such a size as to weigh several pounds. There is seldom much para referred to the breast affected, and when it is complained 0^ the mental uneasiness, excited by apprehension of cancer, is probably the principal cause of its production. If the tumour is small, it may be cut out to relieve the patient's anxiety; and if so large as to occasion inconvenience, its extirpation is more decidedly proper. In the former case, it is necessary to make merely a simple incision through the integuments and substance of the mamma, so as to lay open freely the capsule of condensed cellular membrane which surrounds the tumour, and loosely ad- heres to it; but in the latter, where the morbid growth, from its long standing and large size, may have induced more or less absorption of the gland, and adhesion of it to the adventitious structure, it is best to remove the whole together. In cutting tumours out of the mamma a troublesome hemorrhage may be expected, from the numerous arteiial branches which are divided ;PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 318 and, in addition to a number of ligatures, it is sometimes neces- sary to stuff tlie cavity witli lint.- Cystic Sarcoma. It is comparatively rare to meet with tumours in the mamma entirely composed of a cystic structure ; but cysts are frequently found in growths of a solid kind, particularly the one last men- tioned, and are sometimes so large and numerous as to constitute the principal feature of the disease. Su'ch cystic formations occur at all periods of Hfe, generally in women of a healthy appear- ance ; occasion little inconvenience, except from their size; and tend to increase without any liniitation. Their nature may sometimes be recognised previous to removal by the imperfect feeling of fluctuation and bluish appearance of their contents, perceived through the thin distended integuments by which they are covered; but, in general, the nature of the structure is not precisely ascertained until it is displayed by a section. The inconvenience which results from the bulk of the tumour, and the risk of its becoming the seat of malignant action, are sufficient grounds for recommending excision of the disease at all stages of its progress; and the operation may be performed with the same favourable prognosis as for the fibrous and simple sarcoma. Simple serous cysts, existing without any complication of morbid texture, may be easily remedied by evacuating their contents through means of a trocar, and immediately after- wards applying a blister. Carcinomatous Sarcoma. There is no other part of the body in which carcinomatous degeneration occurs so frequently as in the mamma, though a large proportion of the cases in which it has been, and still is, too often supposed to exist, if subjected to a more accurate diagnosis, would be referred to other kinds of disease, and par- ticularly to those that have been already considered. Carcinoma occiirs in the breast at all periods of life, from the age of twenty upwards; but commences rarely before thirty-live, and mostTHORAX. 319 frequently between forty and fifty. It sometimes seems to be called into existence by the irritation of a blow or bruise^ and is occasionally preceded by simple induration of the gland; but very often a local cause cannot be assigned, or is so loosely con- nected with the appearance of the disease as to give no good ground for believing in its operation. The suppression of thef menstrual secretion is regarded as a great predisposing, or even exciting, cause of the morbid action, by disturbing the balance of the system ; and it has been observed, that distress of mind,' errors of diet, and any other circumstances which derange the secretions, tend further to promote the commencement and in- crease the activity of the disease. I am inclined to think that the cessation of the menstrual discharge does not exert so much influence as is generally attributed to it, and suspect that this opinion rests more. upon theoretical grounds, or views of pro- bability, than actual experience. It is true that, in women suffering from cancer of the breast, the catamenia are seldom present; but if inquiry be made whether their disappearance or the commencement of the disease was first noticed, the latter will in many cases prove to have been the earlier of the two events. Carcinoma of the mamma is recognised by its inequality of surface, extreme hardness, and specific gravity, which is greater than that of any other tissue, sound or morbid, except bone and ' cartilage. The integuments, when adherent to the tumour, are puckered, and drawn towards it. The nipple is flattened, hardened, and depressed. The patient complains of occasional lancinating pain shooting through the tumour, and from it in various directions ; and she generally betrays, by her greenish- yellow complexion, that depraved state of health, which, whether it be a cause or consequence, or partly both, as is most probable, usually attends such local affections. The course of the morbid process, if it be allowed to proceed, is to engage the glands of the axilla, which become enlarged and indurated; to form ill-con- ditioned matter hi the substance of the carcinomatous masses; to evacuate the contents of these abcesses by ulcerative absorp-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 320 tion of the superjacent parts; and thus give rise to sores which prove truly incurable cancers. The pain and discharge that ensue occasion more or less exhaustion of the patient, but are seldom the immediate cause of death, as she generally dies before they produce this effect; and existence is often terminated in such cases so suddenly and unexpectedly as to suggest the suspicion of a poisonous influence proceeding from the disease. The patient generally complains of what she believes to be rheumatic pains, extending through the whole body, but being particularly severe in the arm of the affected side, which is often cedematous, numb, and powerless ; and the fatal event is usually preceded by sickness, loss of appetite, and extreme weakness. Effusion into the ca^dties of the chest is occasionally the cause of death. The skin sometimes shews a great tendency to assume the diseased action, either being primarily affected with it, or, wliile. the gland is undergoing this morbid change, becoming studded at various distances with flat carcinomatous tubercles. The disease varies greatly in the rapidity of its progress, accord- ing to circumstances, which seldom admit of being satisfactorily distinguished, but generally proceeds more slowly in advanced periods of life. The appearances which are presented by the section of car- cinomatous tumours, though they all agree in some respects, differ considerably in others. There is always more or less of a very dense, almost cartilaginous structure, of a mixed brownish- gray, and bluish-white colour, which exists either in the form of compact masses, with bands of a similar substance, that radiate from the centre,—or in that of capsules, smooth and distinct ex- ternally, but gradually softening towards the interior. Within this texture there are, as the disease advances, cavities filled with a soft friable grayish-yellow or brown substance, or thin imperfectly-formed purulent matter. Sometimes the appearance produced by the radiating fibrous bands is strikingly marked, while at others, though the carcinomatous texture does not form a capsule, the confines of the morbid formation are very distinctly circumscribed,—and there seems to be a mixture of the brown321 THORAX. and wMte dense texture approaching to a granular consistence, and containing small cells filled with semifluid matter. The distinction between this and the more diffused form of carcinoma should be carefully observed, as it affords some assistance in deciding on the prognosis as to the duration of recovery after the tumour has been removed. When the lymphatic glands suffer carcinomatous degeneration, the morbid structure always assumes the capsular form, unless the disease should be very far advanced, and adhesions to the neighbouring parts have taken place. In this case radiating bands may be discovered, but hardly with the same distinctness that they usually present themselves, when the disease originates in the substance of the mamma. The cure of carcinoma, whether in the state of scirrhus or cancer, by external or internal remedies, being confessedly im- practicable, it does not seem necessary to mention the various means that have been ineffectually employed for this purpose. Leeching, soothing fomentations, and attention to the general health, alleviate the ujieasy sensation of scirrhus, and delay its progress towards ulceration. Poultices of hemlock, and Fowler's solution of arsenic, diminish the agonising pain of cancer. Solu- tions of chloride of lime or soda destroy the fetor which proceeds from its discharge; and more or less temporary amendment results from the application of various ointments, powders, and washes, which can never be prescribed with any certainty of benefit, and must be frequently changed to obtain even the slight and transitory improvement that they at best afford. The usual method of giving relief is to remove the morbid structure with the knife, the depth and connections of the affected parts rendering other means of extirpation, such as caustic and the ligature, seldom admissible. Few questions in surgery have occasioned more discussion than that which has been, and still is; agitated in regard to the propriety of operating. It is ad- mitted that relapse frequently occurs after excision has been performed; bui much difference of opinion exists as to the chance of its doing so, and tlie consequent advantage of tlie Y322 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEIIY. operation. It would appear, on the whole, that the prospect of permanent recovery is not so hopeless as it has been represented, provided the operation be performed only in proper cases and in an efficient manner. Similar diseases are removed from other parts of the body, as the lip, with almost invariable success; but no surgeon thinks of cutting out a cancer of the lip if there be an affection of the glands under the chin ; and, in operating, he carries his knife wide of the morbid part, and leaves a perfectly sound surface for healing. In excision of the mamma, on the contrary, a diseased state of the axillary glands is often either totally disregarded, or coUsidered no obstacle to the operation, provided they admit of removal; and the surgeon frequently cuts close to, or perhaps at some points through, the substance of the tumour. It need not, therefore, excite any surprise, or lead to distrust in the advantage of the operation, to find that the disease frequently returns. The affection of the glands should be regarded as an objection to the operation not so much from presenting an obstacle in the way of its complete perform- ance, as from affording evidence of a tendency in the constitu- tion of the patient to take up the diseased action. The different cases of carcinomatous disease may be divided (into—1. Those where an operation is altogether improper; 2. I Those where it may be performed, but with a very unfavourable i prognosis ; and, 3. Those where it has a chance of proving per- manently successful. The first class will include cases in which I there are enlarged glands, so seated or connected that tbey can- i not be removed,—or where the skin is so extensively diseased that all the morbid portion of it cannot be taken away,—or lastly, where there is positive evidence of some other part of \ the body, as the stomach or uterus, being similarly affected, I or of some other internal disease of a serious nature, such as dropsical effusion of the chest. The second class comprehends those cases in which the glands are tainted, but within reach,^ or in which the disease is in the state of open cancer, or the I progress of the morbid process rapid,—or the patient's appear- ance unhealthy. And to the third class may be referred thoseTHORAX. 323 ill which the disease has advanced slowly,—feels circumscribed, —is not attended with enlargement of the glands, and exists in a person of tolerably healthy appearance. Should the complaint have been' distinctly the consequence of local irritation, or the patient be of an age at which the predisposition is generally not veiy strong, as above sixty, the prognosis will be still more favourable. In very advanced periods of life, as beyond seventy, the diseased action is so slow, and the chance of troublesome symptoms consequently so small, that the operation would in general not be warranted. In my own practice I decline to operate except in cases of the third class just mentioned, and have no hesitation in advising this limitation of interference with the knife, having seen much mischief and no benefit from operations where the glands were affected, though only in a slight degree. When the operation is to be performed, the patient should be laid in a reclining posture, properly supported, and turned towards the light. The nipple, as being a part likely to take up the diseased action, if it has not already done so, and, for the same reason, the whole of the gland, should always be taken away. For this purpose ;two curved incisions are to be made in the direction of the fibres of the pectoral muscle, including an elliptical portion of the integuments, together with the nipple ; unless the particular circumstances of the case render it more convenient to cut in some other way, so as to remove the whole of the affected integument. In calculating the direction and \ extent of the incisions, the object should be, in the first place, / to include all the skin that is diseased ; and in the second, to ^ leave no more of it than what is sufficient for allowing the edges of the wound to be brought together without straining. The surgeon then exposes the anterior surface of the tumour com- pletely, first separating the lower flap, and then the upper one, while the assistant presses his fingers on the orifices of the divided arteries. In doing this he should proceed carefully and deliberately, so as to cut wide of the confines of the disease, and keeping in mind that the permanency of recovery is a more im-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 324 portant object than the rapidity of the operation. He lastly turns up the edge of the tumour, and detaches its remaining connections. The vessels that continue to bleed having been tied, the edges of the wound should be stitched together, and covered with compresses of Unt. Instead of a bandage surround- ing the chest, a folded towel ought then to be applied. Medullary Sarcoma. The medullary sarcomatous affection of the mamma occurs at all periods of life beyond puberty, but most frequently about middle age. The tumour is recognised by its usual characters of irregularly-nodulated surface, and soft elastic consistence, either throughout its whole extent, or at the most prominent parts, which are generally red, either of a dull or bright hue, and exhibit numerous small arborescent vessels. The pain attending the disease varies much in different cases, being at one time very severe, at another hardly perceptible. When there is a strong disposition to the unhealthy action, the complexion of the patient is of a greenish-yellow colour, and the countenance has a peculiar anxious expression. The tendency of the morbid growth is to enlarge ; to contract adhesions with the integuments and muscles in its neighbourhood; to excite a similar disease in the axillaiy glands; to suppurate, ulcerate, and fungate; and occasionally in this last stage to throw out blood from time to time, but more frequently a thin watery discharge, which is in general very copious and fetid. The substance of the tumour often protrudes at the ulcerated openings in large masses, which seem nearly in a sloughing state, and are occasionally altogether detached. The bulk of the swelling is thus diminished, but enough of the disease remains to prevent a cure from being accomplished. The different steps of this process are completed, and follow each other, with various degrees of rapidity. A few months are sometimes sufficient for the whole progress from the first to the last stage, and, on the other hand, years even may elapse before the disease proves fatal.THORAX. 325 All external and internal remedies have been found quite unavailing in. the treatment of medullary sarcoma, whether in the mamma or elsewhere, and the only mode of affording the patient relief is to out out the morbid structure. To this opera- tion the same objections have been urged as to that for carcinoma, and the same considerations ought to guide the surgeon in de- ciding on the propriety of its performance. If the whole of the diseased parts cannot be taken away, no operation ought to be attempted. If the operation be performed when the morbid process has made a rapid advance—the patient's appearance is xmhealthy—^the confines of the tumour are indistinctly circum- scribed—or when ulceration has taken place, the prognosis will be very unfavourable. If the tumour is of firm consistence— distinctly limited—not adherent—of slow formation—and the patient has a tolerably healthy appearance, the prospect of a durable recovery will be better. The appearances found on dissection also afford important indications in regard to the result. The more soft and bloody the consistence of the tumour is, the more malignant may be regarded the morbid disposition; and the more firm it is, the more fibrous intersecting bands it contains—the more, ia short, it approaches the nature of fibrous sarcoma, the less fear may be entertained of a relapse. Since the two kinds of malignant disease pass into each other by insensible degrees, and, when existing in their distinct forms, present varieties hardly less numerous than the cases in which they occur, any attempt to classify their shades of difference could obviously serve no purpose of practical utility. i.-:-iiif326 rKINClPLES OF SUBGEKY. CHAPTEE XVII. ABDOMEN. Wounds of the Abdomen. Wounds of the abdominal parietes not penetrating the peritoneum require merely the ordinary treatment that is proper for injuries of the class to which they belong. "When the peritoneum is implicated, the wound must be regarded as much more dangerous, since this membrane, like all the others of a serous kind, is very apt to inflame when thus injured. There is seldom much internal hemorrhage in such cases, as the pressure of the viscera, which are contained in the cavity of the abdomen, opposes it. In treating simple penetrating wounds, it is evidently proper,, in the first place, to press back any part of the intestines or omentum that may be protruded through the aperture. This should be done as gently and with as little delay as possible. Great care must be taken, also, that the protrusion is not merely returned under the integuments, without being fairly restored to the abdominal cavity, especially if the wound be "oblique and narrow, as when inflicted by a pointed instrument. In cases of this sort, it has happened that the inner opening of the wound so compressed the intestines or omentum permitted to remain in it, under the erroneous impression that reduction had been com- pletely effected, as to cause fatal inflammation. The surgeon, therefore, should follow the protruded parts with his finger, and not be satisfied wdth their replacement until he feels the point within the peritoneum, enlarging the wound in it, if necessary, by means of a probe-pointed bistouiy. It is more particularly necessaiy to observe tliis precaution when any swelling remains at the seat of injuiy, or tlie protrusion tends to re-appear afterABDOMEN. 327 beiug pressed within the external orifice of the wound. 1 once successfully reduced a mass of omentum of the size of a walnut, that lay in an oblique wound, of which the inner aperture was not larger than a small quill. The edges of the wound ought then to be stitched together with the interrupted suture, and the patient must afterwards be diligently protected from all sources of excitement. A milk diet, and moderate depletion, may be employed as preventives of inflammation; and should symptoms of it actually appear, leeching, together with warm fomentations of the abdomen, and the internal administration of calomel with opium, are to be employed without loss of time, since the safety of the patient will depend in a great measure on the activity and decision with which these means are used. During the first twenty-four hours, therefore, the surgeon should be constantly on the watch for increase in the frequency or hardness of the pulse, anxiety of the countenance, and tenderness of the abdomen to pressure. Should there be no positive evidence of the wound actually penetrating the peritoneum, as from protrusion. of the viscera, it ought to be treated with the same attention as if there were,—since it is much better to run the risk of being too careful, than to fall into the opposite error of not being sufficiently so. And it would be highly improper to decide the question by probing, as, in case of the wound penetrating, this must neces- sarily increase the danger of inflammation. "When the intestine is woimded, the injury must be regarded as still more serious, and likely to be followed by the worst consequences. The reason of this will appear from the fact, that whenever the contents of the bowels are effused over the surface of the peritoneum, death is the invariable, and, in general, very speedy result. "When this extravasation occurs in consequence of disease, the effect is the same, unless the ulcerative process, that forms the breach in the intestine, is preceded by or accom- pam'ed with such an effusion of lymph as to limit the extent of the mischief, and confine the extravasation within the bounds of an abscess. It is not easy to understand how the intestinal matters operate thus fatally on the system, when they escap^328 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. into the cavity of the abdomen; for the patient often dies in a few hours after the discharge takes place, and long before it can be supposed that inflammation has proceeded to the extent requisite for destroying life. The symptoms presented are intense burning pain of the abdomen,—insatiable thirst,—cold- ness of the extremities,—collapse of the features,—cold clammy sweat,—small frequent pulse,—coffee-coloured vomiting; in short, a condition nearly the same as that of sinking from morti- fication. The fatal event generally happens between the 20th and 30th hours, and seldom sooner than the 12th, or later than the 48th. "When death does not ensue untU the later periods that have been mentioned, there are always traces of inflammation to be perceived ; but when it happens within a few hours after the in- jury has been sustained, no such appearances can be discovered. The disastrous eflect of penetrating wounds is opposed by the resistance which the surfaces of the neighbouring viscera offer to the escape of the intestinal contents, and also by the contraction of the muscular fibres of the bowel at the injured part, which tends to protrude the mucous membrane through the aperture so as to obstruct it. If the effusion is restrained by these means for a short time, it may be prevented altogether by an adhesive exu- dation of lymph, that soon seals up the orifice, and unites the adjoining surfaces together. It will be most apt to occur when the intestine injured is distended by fluid contents,—when the wound is longitudinal in respect to the direction of the canal,— and when, if transverse, it is so large as to divide the circumfer- ence of the gut to a considerable extent. Extravasation of the contents of the urinary and gall-bladders produces the same effects as that of the intestinal matters. Internal hemorrhage may occur either from an artery of the abdominal parietes, or from the vessels of the viscera. It is recognised by the usual indications of weakness, coldness, and sickness, together with a feeling of oppression in the abdomen, and, in extreme cases, a fluctuation perceptible on examination externally. On dissection, the blood is found either diffused in329 ABDOMEN, a thiu stratum over the whole peritoneal surface, or accumulated at one part. ■ In the diagnosis of wounded intestine, probing of every sort is quite inadmissible. The shape and size of the weapon that inflicted the injury, together with the direction and extent of the course which it seems likely to have taken, will afford some groimd of probable suspicion ; vomiting, or dejection of blood by stool, will not only prove that the gut has been wounded, but lead to a conjecture as to the seat of injury ; and the symptoms of intestinal effusion, or the escape of feculent and bilious matters from the wound, will render the case more decided. Should the wounded intestine protrude through the integuments, the extent of the injury may, of course, be determined by simple inspection. In respect to the treatment of wounded intestine, it is evident, that unless the inju.red part presents itself to view, no local treatment can be employed to remedy the injury, and that the patient's oaly chance of recovery will depend upon the powers of the system effecting the process of reparation which has been described. The object of the surgeon should be to prevent this process from being disturbed, with which view he will be led to enjoin absolute rest, with strict starvation, and abstinence from purgatives. If the injured part of the gut is protruded, an im- portant question will present itself in regard to the management of the wound, with respect to which much variety of opinion and practice has existed. If the wound is very small, and especially if it is seated in a part of the canal not usually distended by its contents, the most prudent course wiU probably be to return the gut, as if it were sound, without any more ceremony. Should the wound be some- what more than a mere puncture, and aUow its cut edges to be distinguished, a suture ought to be passed through them by means of ?i needle, and tied, after which both ends may be cut away close to the knot, and the gut returned, since it has been ascertained by experiments on the lower animals, that stitches inserted into tlie coats of the intestinal canal are detached by \dcerative absorption towards the interior of the tube, and thusPRINCIPLES OF SITEGERY. 330 escape with the feculent discharge. If the wound is so large as to require more than one stitch, as many as seem necessary are to be introduced in the same way at the distance of a quarter of an inch, or less, from each other. If the wound is lacerated or contused, the injured part should be cut away before the edges are joined. And, iinally, if the whole circumference of the gut is divided, it may be best to insert only one stitch on the side next the mesentery, so as to keep the two mouths of the intestine together, and then retain the aperture of the canal in corre- spondence with the external wound. A preternatural opening for the discharge of the bowel must thus in all probability be formed in the first instance; but the immediate danger will be dimi- nished, while room is afforded for subsequent reparation, in the way that will hereafter be described. The viscera of the abdomen, with which may be included the urinary bladder in its distended state, are liable to be ruptured by external violence mthout the infliction of a penetrating wound. The symptoms are those indicative of extravasation of the intestinal matters ; and the result is certainly fatal, almost always within the short period that has been already mentioned. It is imiDortant to know that the bladder, when much distended with urine, may be ruptured very readily, as by falling on the floor or the corner of a table,—since death occurring in such cir- cumstances may give rise to very serious questions in medical jurisprudence. Urinary effusion from this source sometimes does not prove fatal before the lapse of several days, and in a case that came under my ovm observation the patient survived a week. It is also possible that the urine may be effused through a rent in the fore-part of the bladder where it is not covered by the peritoneum, so as to escape into the cellular tex- ture of the abdominal parietes, and permit the patient's recoveiy, as happened in a case which I have x^laced upon recoi-d.* * Contributions to the Patliology and Practice of Surgery, p. 332.ABDOIIEN. 331 Paracentesis Abdoviinis. The abdomen is punctured for the removal of dropsical col- lections of serous fluid in the cavity of the peritoneum, and for the evacuation of cysts developed in the ovary, which grow so larse as to occasion distension of the abdomen. The circum- stances of these diseases, which denote the propriety of paracen- tesis, need not be considered here; and it will be sufficient to explain the mode of performing the operation. The instruments employed for this purpose consist of a trocar and canula. The point of the trocar may be either in the form of a three-sided pyramid, or have a flattened heart-shaped figure with two cutting edges. The canula of the former is round, that of the latter flat; the first is generally employed, and ought to be preferred, especially in cases of ovarian dropsy, where the fluid is often very thick and viscid. In introducing the three- sided instrument, it was formerly the custom to make a pre- liminary incision through the integuments with a scalpel; but this is quite unnecessary, and the fiat one may of course be still more readily j)ushed through the whole of the parietes at once. Two situations have been chiefly selected for the operation— one in the linea alba, about an inch below the umbilicus ; the other in the linea semilunaris, at a point between, and equidis- tant from, the umbilicus and superior anterior spinous process of the ilium. The former of these ought certainly to be preferred, since there is here no danger whatever of wounding either the vessels or viscera,—while, in endeavouring to puncture through the linea semihmaris, the surgeon runs a risk of injuring the epigastric artery, which, owing to the iinequal resistance of the anterior and lateral portions of the abdominal parietes to the force of distension, alters its relation to these points. If it should ever be desired to puncture in this situation, the safest plan is to introduce the instrument at the distance of a hands- breadth from the crest of the ilium, in the course of a line ex- tending from the spinous process to the umbilicus.PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. 332 The patient should be seated on a chair, or the edge of his bed, with the back and legs properly supported. A flannel ban- dage, nine inches broad, and long enough to surround the abdo- men, cross behind, and leave a sufficient hold for an assistant on each side, whose duty is to maintain the pressure as it is dimi- nished by the evacuation of the fluid, is applied. The surgeon then having made an aperture in the bandage, opposite the part where he wishes to puncture, and holding the handle of the trocar in the palm of his hand, while the point of his fore-finger is rested on the abdomen by the side of the canula, pushes the instrument through the thin distended parietes, until he feels that the point does not encounter any more resistance. He then withdraws the trocar, and at the same time insinuates the canula a little farther, to prevent any chance of its escape during the flow of the fluid. When it appears that the cavity has been emptied, the canula may be taken out,—a piqce of folded lint is placed on the wound,—the ends of the bandage, which hitherto have been held by the assistants, are brought round and fastened over the front, or opposite sides of the abdomen, —and the patient is replaced in bed. Hernia. When the viscera of the abdomen are protruded through the parietes of their containing cavity, while the integuments cover- ing the part remain entire, the displacement is named a Hernia. It was formerly thought that the peritoneum was necessarily torn in such cases, whence the disease was named Eupture ; but it has been fully ascertained, that, except in some few rare cases, this membrane always remains entire, and being pushed before the protruded viscera, constitutes a pouch or Sac, as it is called, for their reception. Hernia may take place at almost any part of the abdominal parietes, but does so most frequently through the apertures that naturally exist in them for the transmission of vessels. These are the inguinal and femoral canals, and the umbiliciis ; and the hernial protrusions which occupy them are accordingly named Inguinal, Femoral, and Umbilical.333 ABDOMEN. Ingidnal Hernia. The vessels of tlie testicle in the male, and the round liga- ment in the female, proceed through the parietes of the abdomen in an oblique passage about two inches and a haK long. This passage, which is named the inguinal canal, being formed through the fascire and muscles that constitute the abdominal parietes in the hypogastric region, the connections of which have been variously described, and are still differently regarded, it seems necessary to enter into some anatomical details on the subject. Before doing so, it may be proper to observe that the part of the abdomen to be particularly considered at present is that which lies below a line drawn transversely between the anterior spinous processes of the ilium. Under the integuments and subcutaneous adipose tissue there is here an expansion of condensed cellular substance, con- stituting a membranous fascia, named fascia superficialis, not very thick, but comparatively strong, and always very distinct. Beneath this lies a strong tendinous expansion usually named the tendon of the oUiqum externus; but which, instead of being regarded as subordinate to one particular muscle, ought rather to be considered an independent fibrous structure, like the fascia luraborum, or the fascia lata of the thigh, since many other muscles are attached to it besides the external oblique. Much confusion would thus be avoided; and it might be called the tendinous fascia of the abdomen. "Within this the recti muscles occupy the space on each side of the mesial plane, as far as a line running parallel with it upwards from the tuberosity of the pubis. The internal oblique and transverse muscles cover the remainder of the region under consideration, except a small tri- angular portion of it near the pubis. On the inner side of this muscular layer, there is a fascia, which was first noticed and described by Sir A. Cooper. It is very thin, except at the lower part, and has been named the fascia iransvcrsalis; the peri- toneum comes next, and completes the formation of the abdo- minal parietes. The three fascite that have been mentioned are334 PIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. united together at the line which extends from the spinous process of the ilium to the pubis. They may all be traced distinctly down thus far, but cannot be separated lower without cutting them. The fascia tendinosa (tendon of the exteraal oblique) before uniting with the others, turns back upon itself downwards, so as to present a thick round border like a hem, which has led to the appellation of ligament (Poupart, Fallopius,) to this part. The internal oblique and transverse muscles lie between the fascia tendinosa and fascia transvcrsalis. Their fibres at this part are intimately connected, and constitute but an inconsiderable mass of muscular substance; they are attached to the junction of the fascias all the way from the spinous process to about a third of its length from the pubis. The ms deferens and other vessels which compose the spermatic cord meet together on the outer surface of the peritoneum, about midway between the spinous process and pubis, and about half an inch above Poupai-t's ligament. They here perforate the fascia trans- versalis, not through a well-defined aperture, but by carrying a thin funnel-like projection of it along with them. Descending obliquely towards the pubis, they become united with some fibres of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, which con- stitute the cremaster muscle. Having thus escajDed from under the edge of these muscles, the cord passes through the fascia tendinosa at a sort of slit-like opening about an inch and 'a quarter long, that extends from the tuberosity "of the pubis between the body of the fascia and its inverted margin. Trom the edge of this slit, which is named the external ring, a thin fascia is continued over the cremaster muscle; and the cord then proceeds into the scrotum, covered by an extension of the superficial fascia of the abdomen, which is continued along with it. The epigastric artery rises from the iHac nearly opposite Poupart's ligament, and running in the direction of the umbilicus, between the peritoneum and fascia transvcrsalis, crosses the cord about the middle of the inguinal canal, having nothing inter- posed except the fascia just mentioned. Inguinal hernia either descends along the whole course ofABDOMEN. 335 the cord, or protrudes directly through the external ring. In the former case it is named Inguinal or External Inguinal,_and__£^;<^ in the latter Ventro-Inguinal or Internal Ingu^B^L-.-^lYl^^^-'^'^Lil^^ J • ^ the one kind or the other, it may either remain confined in its extent to the groin, or, getting lower down, distend the scrotum or labium. In the first of these situations it is denominated Bubonocele, and in the others Scrotal or Pudendal Hernia, according to cii-cumstances. There is an important modification of inguinal hernia which takes place before the cavity of the hmica vaginalis ceases to communicate with that of tlie abdomen. The neck of this process of the peritoneum usually becomes im- pervious soon after the descent of the testicle, which generally happens about a month before the time of birth. But if the obliteration is delayed longer, or the foetus is subjected sooner than this to the circumstances which induce the formation of hernia, the viscera are apt to descend into the same bag with the testicle, so that the sac is formed by the tunica vaginalis. The merit of detecting this Congenital hernia is usually ascribed to Percival Pott, but unjustly, as Haller first discovered the descent of the testicle and continuity of the tunica vaginalis with the peritoneum, and also suggested the probability of hernia in infants taking place in that way, while Dr. William Hunter first established the truth of this explanation by dissection. There is-another very rare form of inguinal hernia, in which the pro- truded intestine pushes the peritoneum before it into the tunica vaginalis, so that the sac lies within another sac. I have met with this condition only on one occasion, but then in the most perfect form. The contents of inguinal hernia usually consist of a portion of the ileum, with more or less of the omentum. Sometimes the caput caecum descends by a gradual extension of ^ its cellular connections, and in this case the intestine of course is not completely enclosed in a sac. The sigmoid flexure of the colon also may be protruded, and, tliough more apt to descend on the left side, has been found on the right, while there are not wanting instances of the caput ccecum being discovered on the left. The Hernia is named Enterocele,. Epiplocele, or Entero-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 336 epiplocele, accordingly as it contains intestine or omentum alone, or both together. There is no limit to the size of the protrusion, which varies from mere fulness in the situation of the inguinal apertures, to a size nearly equal to the whole intestinal canal. The causes of hernia may be divided into those which pre- dispose to the disease, and those which immediately give rise to it. The predisposing causes are circumstances which diminish the resistance that opposes the exit of the viscera. Of these the sex of the patient may be mentioned first, since the larger size of the inguinal canal in males renders their predisposition to the disease greatly superior to that of females, so that the proportion which the cases of the former bear to those of the latter is at least a hundred to one. Emaciation and relaxation of the body diminish the resistance remarkably, and some persons seem to labour under a natural peculiarity of structure that exposes them more than others to the disease. The exciting causes consist in the operation of more than usual compressing force acting on the viscera of the abdomen. Such force is exerted during every energetic effort, especially if made with the superior extremities; since, to give the muscles of the arms firm points of attachment, the chest must be rendered immovable, and this is done by contracting the diaphragm together with the abdominal muscles, while the glottis is kept closely shut. The viscera, being thus compressed between the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, are violently forced against the whole surface of the cavity, and if any weak part exist in it, a ]protrusion takes place. This effect is most apt to happen when an effort is made in the erect posture, for the diaphragm, which then extends obliquely downwards and backwards, will consequently press the viscera - downwards and forwards in the direction of the inguinal open- ings. An attention to the same circumstance will afford some explanation of the fact that inguinal hernia occurs much more frequently on the right than the left side, the reason of which appears to be that, when an effort is made, the trunk of the body is usually bent to the opposite side, and, as most vigorous efforts are made with the right arm, the diaphragm will on such occa-337 ABDOMEN. sions generally present its concave surface, and consequently press towards tlie right groin. Tight articles of dress, which compress the abdomen, and increase the confinement of its con- tents without strengthening the parietes at the natural apertures, promote the occurrence of hernia. The symptoms of inguinal hernia cannot be properly described or understood without considering separately three different states in which the disease may exist. In the first of these, the viscera return into the abdomen when the patient assumes the horizontal posture, or when moderate pressure is applied to the tumour. The hernia is then said to be Eeducible. In the second state, the viscera are detained in the sac, but pro- duce no further inconvenience, when the hernia is said to be Incarcerated. And in the third, the viscera are not only pre- vented from leaving the sac, but suffer in it such pressure or constriction as impedes the exercise of their functions, and produces other bad consequences, in which case the hernia is said to be Strangulated. The symptoms of Eeducible inguinal hernia are—a tumour in the region of the inguinal canal, colourless, elastic, and com- pressible, which disappears when the patient Lies down, or when moderate pressure is applied; and a gurgling noise or sensation when the viscera return into the abdomen. The circumstances which occasion Incarceration are—1. Thickening and hardening of the omentum, which comes to resemble the pancreas or even denser structures; 2. Adhesions between the viscera and sac; 3. Distension of the gut with intestinal matters; and 4. The peculiar condition of the cai^t ccecum, which cannot return, except slowly, in the same way it descended, by gradual exten- sion of its cellular connections. The presence of a colourless elastic tumour, of unequal consistence, in the region of the inguinal canal, together with the histoiy of the case, distinguishes the disease. Strangulation depends upon the pressure which is caused by the tough fibrous margin of the inguinal apertures or the condensed neck of the sac. The viscera may begin to suffer from the constriction immediately after their protrusion, or may zPKINCIPLE8 OF SURGERY. 338 not do SO until long afterwards, on the occasion of another portion being suddenly forced down into the sac, or from the intestine becoming gorged with its contents. The symptoms of strangulation are a twisting burning pain referred to the umbilical region, constipation, sickness, and vomiting. The patient's coim- tenance is coUapsed, pale, and anxious. His pulse is small and feeble, his extremities are cold, and he cannot rest. The consti- pation does not depend altogether, as might be supposed, on mechanical obstruction of the bowels, since it is observed where the omentum alone is contained in the hernia, and does not always prove obstinate where the intestine is concerned. It seems to be owing chiefly to the perverted action of the gut consequent on the pressure which it suffers. At first there is little pain referred to the seat of the disease; but if the patient is not relieved, inflammation commences, and then the tumour becomes red, tense, painful, and tender to the touch. This in- flammation may extend inwards and prove fatal, like peritonitis proceeding from any other source, or it may remain confined to the protruded viscera, and, perhaps leading in the first instance to effusion of lymph, terminate in their mortification, when the patient either dies, or recovers with a preternatural opening of the gut at the groin. The time, required for the completion of this process varies extremely in its different stages. It is observed to proceed most rapidly when the patient is young and stout, and when the hernia is small and recent. It is generally more slow in opposite circumstances, but many exceptions occur, and it is never possible to predict with any precision the time that will elapse before inflammation and its consequences are induced. Mortification rarely takes place sooner than eight hours, or later than eight days after the strangulation has com- menced. The treatment of Eeducible hernia consists in the use of means proper for obviating the predisposing and exciting causes of the disease. With this view the inguinal region of the ab- dominal parietes should be strengthened by the mechanical support of a bandage. A timely use of this apparatus mayABDOMEN. 339 prevent the occiirrence of hernia in persons whose predisposition to the disease is manifested by a fulness perceptible in the groin during the impulse of coughing, and by a painful sensation at the same part whenever the viscera are subjected to more than usual pressure, as in making exertion with the arms, or speaking loud. The predisposition being thus guarded against, all sources of excitement must be carefully avoided. The patient should abstain from every sort of food that, by producing flatulence, causes distension of the bowels; he ought to correct any tendency that may be observed to accumulation in the intestinal canal; and he should never engage in exercises or employments that require severe bodily exertion. In the treatment of congenital hernia, it is of great consequence that the truss should be applied as early as possible, in order that the natural disposition which the parts concerned have to close at the time of birth may be allowed to exert its effect, and a radical cure be thus obtained. Beyond this age, if a bandage is ever required, it can very rarely be afterwards dispensed with. Various attempts have at different times been made to remedy the tendency to protrusion by operative procedure, but of these it is needless to mention more than the one some years ago pro- posed by Professor Wiitzer, of Bonn. This was to invaginate the scrotal integument by pressing it up the inguinal canal, retain it-there by passing a needle through it, together with the margin of the external ring, and then keep all the parts concerned in this condition by a very complicated apparatus, until the adhesive process was so far advanced as to render it unnecessary. Approv- ing of the principle—but disliking the complexity of this method —I have endeavoured to simphfy it by employing merely apiece of bougie, gutta percha, or other solid substance, sufficient to fill the hollow of the invaginated integument, with a double thread attached to one of its extremities, and a curved needle in a fixed handle. In performing the operation by means of the needle guided along the finger, which is introduced fairly within the abdominal ring, first one of the threads and then the other is passed through the edge of the tendon, the bougie is drawn upPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 340 into its place, and the threads are tied tightly over a little roll of plaster or lint, to prevent ulceration of the skin, the whole being secured by a compress and spica bandage. In the treatment of Incarcerated hernia, the object should be to remove the obstacles which oppose reduction. The intestines should be unloaded by the free administration of purgatives and injections. If there is reason to suppose that the resistance to the return of the protruded parts depends on thickening and induration of the omentum, which sometimes can be felt through the parietes of the tumour, the patient should be confined to bed, restricted to a slender diet, and depleted from time to time by bleeding, or cathartics, with the view of producing, dimng the general emaciation of the body thus induced, a sufficient diminu- tion of the omental mass to permit the accomplishment of reduc- tion. In the case of adhesions existing between the viscera and sac, the only practicable mode of overcoming the difficulty would be to lay open the contents of the hernia, and separate their morbid connections. Operations have accordingly been performed for this purpose, but their almost uniformly fatal result ought to deter all prudent surgeons from repeating such attempts. And if the gentle means above mentioned should prove unavailing, it will be better to advise the patient to be satisfied with such palliation of his complaint as may be obtained from strict atten- tion to the state of his bowels, abstinence from all violent exertions, and the support of a bag truss, than to endanger his life by trying to effect a radical cure with the knife. The Strangulated condition of hernia being attended not only with extreme suffering, but also with great and immediate danger, demands the most speedy and decided assistance of the surgeon. His first object is of course to effect reduction ; and this he im- mediately endeavours to perform by a careful manipulation, which is named the Taxis. The patient should be laid reclining, with his shoulders and pelvis slightly elevated, to relax the parietes of the abdomen; and with the same intention, the tliigh of the affected side should be bent upwards and inwards, as the fascia lata is thus prevented from causing any tension of theABDOMEN. 341 abdominal fascije to whicli it is connected. The hernial tumour is then to be grasped at its neck, and compressed with the points of the fingers and thumb, which at the same time pull it slightly out- wards. The size of the parts at the ring having been thus dimin- ished, the pressure is to be directed gently but steadily upwards, in the direction of the inguinal canal. When, in consequence of this proceeding, the slightest gurgle is heard or felt, or the size of the swelling is perceptibly diminished, the reduction, in general, may be very soon completed. The larger the hernia is, the more may be expected from this manipulation, and vice versa. There is almost always some serous effusion iuto the cavity of the sac, and in small tumours, especially those of recent production with acute symptoms, the bulk of the fluid bears a large propoii;ion to that of the intestine or omentum. External pressure, conse- quently, however carefully employed, cannot possibly have its effect confined to the neck or any other portion of the stran- gulated parts, since, through the medium of the fluid, its force must be diffused over the whole surface, and therefore urge the entire mass against the narrow aperture by which it is required to retui-n.' WMle circumstances are thus opposed to the bene- ficial influence of pressure from without, it is obvious that the small size of the protrusion, which is often not larger than the point of the finger, and seldom exceeds that of a walnut in most cases, will afford little resistance to an effort in the opposite direction. It accordingly often happens that after the Taxis has failed, the tumour suddenly, and, as it seems, spontaneously dis- appears, no doubt through the operation of some internal change in the condition of the bowels or omentum. Such being the case, in the event of the Taxis failing, it is obviously proper to use means that may produce some effect of the kind reqxxisite for withdrawing the protruded parts into the abdominal cavity. Of these may be mentioned a change of posture, by elevating the pelvis and bending the shoulders back- wards, in order to make a drag on the strangulated viscera, to- gether with the administration of enemata to evacuate the intestines, and thus lessen the resistance to return. BleedingPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY-. 342 largely to diminish the contractile tone of the muacular fibres— using the warm bath with the same view—and in addition to it also employing opium or tobacco, with the application of cold externally, and the internal use of tartrate of antimony, or purgatives, were formerly resoi-ted to, but have been superseded by the more eflicient and less objectionable agency of chloro- form. The choice of means for the pui-pose of promotiug reduction must be determined by the circumstances of the case. When the patient is strong or plethoric, it will always be right, in the first instance, to abstract a considerable quantity of blood. Ee- peated injections, or the warm bath, if .it can be procured, should also be employed. The bowels having been thus, if possible, unloaded, and the spasmodic tension of the abdominal muscles, which is caused by the irritation of the disease, and reacts in- juriously upon it by tightening the fasciaj which produce the stricture, having been subdued or dimiiushed, the taxis is again to be tried. If it should fail, in the more favourable circum- stances that now exist, the sui-geon must think of removing the resistance by dividing the stricture with the knife. It is diffi- cult to determine how long the operation may be safely deferred, as inflammation and gangrene supervene much more quickly in some cases than in others. The best course is to operate so soon as a fair trial has been given without success to the taxis, and the measures which promote it, especially bleeding, and the warm bath if it can be procured. It should be recollected— 1. That the danger of the operation itself is very inconsiderable; and that, consequently, the patient should not, from fear of incurring it, be subjected to the greater risk, or rather almost certainty, of a fatal issue, which attends the disease when allowed to follow its own course. 2. That the progress of the bad consequences is usually rapid, in proportion as-the hernia is small, recent, and tense. 3. That in small recent hernias there is least advantage to be expected from waiting. 4. That in large hernias, strangulated in consequence of congestion, there is most assistance to be looked for from the continued use of purgativesABDOMEN. 343 aud injections. 5. That the operation is attended with least danger in cases where the tumour is small and recent; and with most where it is large and of old standing. When the operation is judged necessary, the patient should be brought to the edge of his bed, so as to present the groin in a favourable position. His shoulders ought to be elevated a little, and the thigh of the affected side is to be slightly bent. The operator having shaved off the hairs, makes an incision about three inches long, in the direction of the inguinal canal, begin- ning rather above the commencement of the tumour, and con- tinned down the middle or most projecting part of it, towards the bottom. This incision is most conveniently accomplished by lifting up a fold of the integuments, together with as much as possible of the loose cellular tissue exterior to the tense parietes of the tumour, and running the knife through it with the back turned towards the sac. If the superficial epigastric, or any other artery of the integuments which may have been cut, threatens to bleed much, it should be tied before going further. The surgeon has then to divide the layers of fasciee which cover the sac; and the old method of doing this was to cut them suc- cessively upon a grooved director thrust under them, so as to elevate portion by portion. Instead of a practice so tedious and perplexing, it is better to dissect through the coverings by raising them with the forceps, cutting the fold thus elevated with the knife held parallel to the sac, and then dividing each layer in succession, upwards and downwards, to the extent of the external incision. In general the peritoneum may be recognised by a bluish appearance which it presents, owing to the presence of fluid contained within it, and by its more loose connections than those of the superjacent parts ; but these characters are deceptive; and it is fortunately not necessai^ that this recognition should be effected previous to opening the sac. If it is opened in the same way that has been recommended for cutting through the fascise, there will be no danger of wounding the contained viscera; and so soon as they are exposed, the dark colour of the intestine, and the smooth glistening internal surface of itsPRINCIPLES OF SUKGEKY. 344 peritoneal covering, which contrasts remarkably with the rough and bleeding external surface of the sac, and those of the fascite, independently of any other signs, will at once assure the surgeon that he has opened the sac. When the hernia is small, its coverings and the sac ought always to be divided first at the fundus, or bottom of the tumour, as they are there most apt to be separated from the intestine by serous fluid, which is almost always present in more or less quantity, and sometimes con- stitutes the principal part of the swelling. In a small hernia also, the sac should be opened throughout its whole extent; but if it is large, merely such a portion of its neck as may be suffi- cient for allowing the stricture to be. reached and divided. If the presence of fluid could be depended upon there would be no danger in openiug the sac ; but as it is occasionally, though cer- tainly very seldom, absent, so that the peritoneal covering lies in close contact with the strangulated parts, it would be extremely imprudent in any case to operate with reliance on the protection which is thus not certainly afforded. The safest mode of pro- ceeding is to pinch up a small portion of the sac with the forceps,, and then to divide it, holding the knife parallel with the surface of the tumour. Wherever an aperture, however small, is made, fluid, if any is contained in the cavity, escapes, and the smooth shining surface of the contained viscera is readily recognised. While the forceps still retain their hold of the membrane, a blunt-pointed curved bistoury shovild be introduced and carried to the requisite extent, with the additional protection of the operator's finger interposed between it and the intestine. After the protruded viscera have been exposed, the next step of the operation is to divide the strictui-e. This might be done in any direction, were it not that the epigastric artery and sper- matic cord, lying in the neighbourhood of the neck of the sac, limit the choice within more narrow bounds. When the hernia protrudes through the internal opening of the canal, it is seated anteriorly to the cord, and has the epigastric artery on the pubic side of its neck. In cases of old standing, wliere the tumour attains a large size, the spermatic vessels are sometimes separated345 ABDOMEN. from each other, and fouud on the lateral, or even anterior part of the sac. In such cases, too, the obliquity of the canal becomes much diminished, and it is often at length impossible to tell, by external examination, whether the hernia is external or internal; in other words, whether it has passed through the whole course of the canal, or escaped directly through the external ring. When it is of the latter or ventro-inguinal kind, the cord lies on the iliac side of its neck, behind which it crosses obliquely downwards, and the epigastric artery is also on the same side ranning upwards and inwards. It appears, therefore, that if the stricture were divided by cutting towards the pubis, the epigastric would be endangered in the former case; and that, if the knife were carried outwards, it would in the latter subject both the epigastric artery and the cord to the risk of injury. As it is often difficiilt, and sometimes impossible, to ascertain positively, either from the examination of the tumour, or from its previous history, whether the vessels are situated on its ihac or pubic side, the safest plan is always to cut upwards, in which direction there can never be any risk incurred. The simple probe-pointed bistoury, which has been. employed for the preliminary part of the operation, is the most safe and efficient instrument for divid- ing the stricture. The surgeon should introduce the fore-linger of his right or left hand, according to circumstances, between the sac and viscera as high as he can, and then, feeling the stricture with its point, carry up the knife with its side turned towards the finger, until it is insinuated between the intestine or omentum and the sac, when, tiirning its edge upwards, he raises the handle gently but steadily, and repeats this process until he perceives that there is a free passage for his finger into the abdomen. The late Mr. Aston Key, and Mr. Luke of London, have endeavoured to lessen the danger of the operation by dividing the constriction without opening the sac. The advantages attri- buted to this procedure, from leaving the serous membrane entire, seem more than counterbalanced by the risk of wounding the intestine in dividing the stricture, the evUs which may result from returning the strangulated parts in an improper condition,PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 346 and the mischief that may arise from abortive elToits to effect reduction, when it is impeded by adhesion, or other obstacles within the sac. On the whole, I am inclined to tliink that, as a general rule, it is better to oxDen the sac; and that the procedure in question should be restricted to the treatment of large hernial protrusions when the bad consequences of opening the sac are greatest, and the difficulty of dividing the stricture smallest. The third step of the operation consists in the management of the protruded viscera. If the hernia is recent, and inflammation has not been excited, the intestine and omentum present nearly their usual appearance, except that the former is more or less thickened in its coats, and has a dark, purple, or brownish colour. In such cii'cumstances, the gut should be returned first by gentle pressure, similar to that employed in the taxis, and then the omentum. If effusion of lymph has taken place on the surface of the intestine in consequence of inflammation, the reduction may be performed as in the former case, but, of course, with a less favourable prognosis. If old adhesions, existing between the surfaces of the intestine, or between them and the sac, oppose reduction, they ought to be divided when this is practicable, and when it is. not, the parts must be left to themselves ; the integu- meuts being brought together, or simply covered by a pledget of ointment. It might be expected that more of the intestine would thus be permitted to escape, but it is foimd that when the stricture has been freely divided, the functions of the bowels re- stored, and the patient confined to the horizontal posture, the protrusion gradually diminishes, and finally withdraws itself into the abdomen. The same practice is proper when the caput cmcixm has descended. Should the omentum be so thickened and indurated as not to permit reduction, it may be cut away as far as is necessary, any vessels that require ligatures being tied. Exit from what has fallen within my own observation, I am in- clined to thinlc that it is better to leave the omentum in the sac, than to practise excision of the indurated portion, since there is thus incurred a risk of several bad consequences. In the fint place, whether from the wound alone or the ligatures, which areABDOMEN. 347 freq[ueiitly required iu considerable numbers, inflammation is apt to be excited ; and, secondly, that most troublesome and dan- gerous occurrence, ulceration of the intestine, is apt to happen, probably from the bowel adhering to the wounded part of the omentum, and losing the protection of its serous covering, which is slow to undergo the ulcerative process. Lastly, when the in- testine is discovered by its soft consistence and fetid odour to be iu a mortified state, any attempt at reduction would be highly imprudent, since the patient's only chance of escape from the fatal effusion of its contents into the abdominal cavity depends upon lymph being thrown out and around the mouth of the sac. If this barrier be broken up, death will inevitably happen, and therefore the surgeon should either leave the contents of the hernia as he finds them, or limit his interference to laying the gut freely open, if it is not so already, after which a soft poultice, or pledget of emollient ointment, may be placed on the part. After the operation, unless circumstances should require the wound to be kept open, its edges ought to be drawn together by stitches, and have a thick compress of folded lint supported by a bandage applied over them. When things go on well, the patient experiences relief almost immediately after the operation. The tormenting pain of the umbilical region, the sickness, and the vomiting subside, the warmth of the body becomes uniformly diffused, the anxious ex- pression of the countenance disappears, and a full, soft, mode- rately fr-equent pulse gives further indication of the salutary change that has taken place. In the course of an hour or two, one or more, usually several, copious evacuations of the bowels, shew not only that the gut has been relieved from mechanical obstruction, but that it has been restored to the due performance of its functions. Tenderness of the abdomen, or uneasiness felt in it independently of pressure, will suggest the immediate ap- plication of warm fomentations ; and if it should increase, or be accompanied with acceleration of the pulse, heat of skin, thirst, anxiety, or restlessness, general bleeding and leeching of the abdomen must be resorted to without delay, decidedly andPKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 348 freely, so as if possible to subdue the incipieut peritonitis. Opium and calomel ought at the same time to be administered in doses proportioned to the urgency of the circumstances. In consequence, probably, of the pressure which has been sustained by the gut while strangulated, and which there is reason to be- lieve generally occasions a certain degree of constriction in the canal for a considerable length of time subsequent to reduction, the patient is frequently annoyed for days or weeks with occa- sional symptoms of chronic inflammation, for which gentle aperients, administered by the mouth and rectum, leeching, and the counter-irritation of blisters, are the best means of counter- action. It is not prudent to get out of bed, or, at all events, to quit the horizontal posture, until the wound is so far healed as to permit the wearing of an efficient truss, which can hardly ever afterwards be dispensed with. When sloughing of the contents of the hernia takes place, a discharge of the intestinal matters always ensues for a time through the opening thus established in the gut. The cavity of the sac gradually diminishes, its orifice contracts, the integuments surrounding it become callous, and a preternatural anus is formed. If only a part of the circumference of the intestine has been protruded, the remaining portion allows some of the con- tents of the canal to descend naturally, and by degrees more of them, until little and at last none are voided in the groin, the opening of which closes, and then the patient obtains a complete cure. This process of reparation is accomplished with difficulty, in proportion to the extent of gut that has been destroyed; and when its whole circumference has sloughed, a complete loop of the intestine having been strangulated, it can hardly be effected without some artificial assistance. In this case the two con- tiguous walls of the gut constitute a septum which directs the flow of matters passing through the canal so as to make them issue at the preternatural orifice ; and sometimes the upper part of the tube becoming inverted, protrudes through it, so as to form a tumour of various size in the groin. Different methods have been employed for dividing the septum, and thus promot-349 ABDOMEN. ing the natural changes that lead to recovery. Incision is dan- gerous from the risk of cutting too much, and allowing the intestinal matters to be effused into the cavity of the abdomen. A ligature passed through the septum by means of a needle, which was first thought of by Dr. I*hysick of 'New York (1802), is more safe in the first instance, but must subject the patient to the chance of symptoms similar to those of strangulated hernia ; and the plan of M. Dupuytren (1813) seems to be on the whole the best. It consists in compressing the septum between the blades of forceps made to meet very accurately, the one being received into a groove of the other, and regulated in their ap- proximation by a screw. The pressure is thus completely under control, and can be increased, diminished, or altogether with- drawn, according to circumstances. The sloughing of a hernia is not the only cause of preter- natural anus. It may be produced also by ulceration of the intestine after it has contracted adhesions to the parietes- of the abdomen, or by wounds. It is always a source of extreme annoyance, and sometimes occasions dangerous symptoms, by the aperture proving inadequate to discharge the contents of the gut, while they are prevented from descending by their natural route. The treatment, therefore, deserves much attention. In the first instance, it is sufficient to keep the part clean, and pre- vent eversion of the upper extremity of the gut by applying gentle pressure, which is also useful by directing the feculent matters into their old channel. If the gut has become everted, it ought, if possible, to be immediately reduced; and in case this cannot be accomplished. Its more gradual return must be pro- moted by permanent pressure, slender diet, and the horizontal posture. Should the aperture not contract, though there is no protrusion of the intestine, it may be concluded that a septum exists between the two extremities of the tube above or below the aperture ; and its situation having been ascertained by care- ful examination, the compressing instrument of Dupuytren is to be cautious]}' employed. The blades of the forceps should be at first very gently approximated, and never tightened so as toPEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 350 occasion any disagreeable symptoms. When the piece included is detached by ulceration, and the forceps faU off, the case must be treated by gentle pressure and attention to the bowels, as if the septum had not existed. Femoral Hernia. The femoral vessels descending along the inner margin of the psoas magnus rest upon a fascia which covers that muscle, together with the neighbouring iliacus internus, and also lines the cavity of the pelvis. This iliac fascia, as it is named, is united to the fascia iransversalis, so as to appear quite continuous with it, when both are brought into view by stripping off the peritoneum from tlie inner surface of the abdominal parietes. They leave, however, an oval aperture to let the vessels pass through them, which it is necessary to consider particularly. The union of the two fascite is continued from the pubis for about an inch and a half towards the ilium, in the direction of the linea ileo-pectinea, where it terminates by a sort of crescentic margin that is seen very distinctly when the parietes are held up and surveyed from the inner side, after the peritoneum lias been removed. Where the fasciae thus meet together, they are inti- mately and inseparably connected with the reflected margin of the tendinous fascia of the abdomen (tendon of the external oblique) which is attached to the tuberosity and crest of the pubis, and also with the superficial fascia of the abdomen, together with the fascia lata of the thigh. On the iliac side of this crescentic margin, with the interposition of some loose cellular substance and fat, the vessels Lie, resting on the fascia iliaca, which here becomes attached to the bone, and covered by the union of the three abdominal fasciae, which form a bridge over them that has been named the crural arch. Between the vessels and spinous process the iliac and iransversalis fasdcs again unite, and allow the iliacus internus, together with the psoas magnus muscle, to pass under them to the trochanter minor. The fasciae are here closely connected with the vessels, or rather with their slieath of dense cellular substance, in wliich theyABDOMEN. 351 insensibly lose themselves when traced by dissection. The vessels are now, properly spealdng, in the thigh, and become covered with the fasda lata, which has an oval aperture in it on their pubal side, immediately below Poupart's ligament, through which the vena sapJmia finds access to the femoral trunk. The fascia lata, at the margin of this aperture, loses itself on the sheath of the vessels. On their pubal side it passes up, resting on the pectineus muscle, and becomes continuous with the iliac fascia; and on the iliac side, while uniting directly with the abdominal and pelvic fascia, it sends a falciform process inwards over the vessels to the pubis, so as thus to enter into the formation of the crural arch throughout its whole extent. It thus appears that the femoral is separated from the . inguinal canal merely by the fascia transverscdis and reflected margin of the tendinous fascia (tendon of the external oblique). "When the viscera protrude through the space between the vessels and crescentic margin of the crural arch, they constitute what is called a Femoral Hernia. The sac in this case is covered by no fascia, properly speaking, having superjacent to it merely the loose cellular substance which occupied the passage, and the thick mass of cellular substance, glands, and fat, which lies in the triangular hollow at the upper part of the thigh between the pectineus and sartorius muscles. This irregularly laminated and tough tissue, when stretched by the tumour, often presents, on dissection, the appearance of layers, but these are very variable in number, as well as thickness, and cannot be distinguished in an operation. The fasciae, therefore, are interesting in regard to femoral hernia, merely in so far as they constitute the stricture that opposes the reduction of the bowels. The causes of femoral, like those of inguinal hernia, are pre- flisposing and exciting. The predisposition to femoral hernia is nearly as much greater in the female as that to inguinal hernia is in the male, owing to the breadth of the pelvis in the former sex, and the consequent width of the female apertures. The exciting circumstances are similar to those that have been men- tioned, but are apt to be assisted in their operation by the dis-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 352 tended state of the abdomen to which, females are liable from pregnancy; and many of the femoral hernias which occur in practice are accordingly referred to the violent expulsive efforts of parturition. The ileum and omentum are the parts usually protruded. The tumour is generally of a small size, and some- times can be discovered only by feeling in the situation where it is suspected. On account of this circumstance, which is apt to conceal the disease from the patient, and also because females are apt to be prevented by feelings of delicacy from disclosing its existence, it is prudent on all occasions, where symptoms indica- tive of hernia are complained of, to insist upon an examination of the groins. The diagnosis of femoral hernia is often more difiicult than that of inguinal. Wlien reducible, it may be confounded with psoas abscess pointing under Poupart's ligament, and in the two other conditions of incarceration and strangulation it is fre- quently distinguished with difficulty from swelling or inflam- mation of the inguinal glands. If the tumour depends on a reducible hernia, it will disappear under moderate pressure, or by assuming the horizontal posture; but if it is owing to a collection of matter, though lessened perhajDS, it will not be entirely removable by pressure, however carefully applied, so long as the patient remains erect. From chronic swelling, or acute inflammation of the glands, it may be distinguished by the thickness and fixture of its neck—^its more smooth and globular surface—and generally by its history. If a hernia, the tumour will either have existed for a length of time previously, and given indication of its nature by some of the characteristic symp- toms, or have appeared suddenly in consequence of a violent exertion. Glandular swellings again, if chronic, will probably have had their nature ascertained, and if recent, are usually con- nected with some source of irritation that leads to their recog- nition. It is important, however, to know that the glands may become suddenly large and painful in consequence of the strain from a violent effort, in which case sickness, vomiting, .and con- stipation, are not unfrequently induced by the irritation. En-ABDOMEN. 353 larged glands also occasionally exist along with a hernia, and render its diagnosis by examination extremely difficult, or even sometimes impracticable. In all cases of doubt, when other means fail in affording relief, it is the duty of the surgeon to cut down upon the swelling, and ascertain its nature. The symptoms of femoral are the same as those of inguinal hernia. But it is observed, that the bad consequences of strangulation are particu- larly severe and rapid in their progress, which is no doubt to be ascribed to the small size of the protruded portion of intestine, and the extreme tightness of the stricture. The treatment of femoral hernia is to be conducted on the same principles which have been fully explained above. If it is reducible, a truss should be carefully worn ; and it is here even more necessary than in obviating the predisposition to inguinal rupture to fit the bandage properly. The cushion should be more convex, and it may be requisite to prevent its displacement upwards by an additional strap passing round the thigh. "VSHien incarcerated, it should be subjected to the measures that favour reduction ; and if it resists, must be prevented as much as possible from increasing by the compression of a suspensory bag. It may be observed, that femoral hernia is rarely met with in this state. Lastly, in case of strangulation, the taxis, together with its subsidiary means, if necessary, must be had recourse to without delay, so that no time may be lost in dividing the stricture, if this should prove the only resource. In performing the operation it is generally better, on account of the smallness of the tumour, and thickness of the superjacent parts, to make, instead of a simple incision, one of the figure of the letter T. The transverse part of it should be as high as the neck of the swelling, that is, close to Poupart's ligament, and is most readdy effected by lifting up a fold of the skin, together with as much as possible of the parts below that can be sepa- rated from the sac, and running a knife through it with the back turned towards the sac. The surgeon may then cut safely from the centre of this incision downwards, to the same depth with it. He next lays aside tlie two small flaps thus formed, 2a'354 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGEEY. and proceeds to expose the sac, by raising and dividing with the forceps and knife the layers of condensed cellular substance which cover it. If glands come in the way, they must be dis- sected oflf the hernial tumour; and when the sac is approached, the operator should be particularly careful to elevate the layer he wishes to divide at the fundus or most projecting part of the bag, as there is here most fluid between it and the enclosed intestine. In cases of femoral hernia requiring operation, the contents of the tumour are almost always recently protruded, and therefore seldom present those adhesions or other morbid alterations which frequently render the inguinal operation so embarrassing. The direction in which the stricture should be divided has afforded fruitful subject of discussion. If the knife is carried upwards, so as to cut through the crural arch, it must evidently endanger the spermatic cord or round ligament. This, therefore, which was the old operation, is decidedly objectionable. Gim- bernat of Madrid observed (1793), that the stricture in femoral hernia on the pubic side of the neck of the sac was not situated, as had been erroneously believed before, at the tuberosity of the pubis, but at the distance of between one and two inches from it, and was formed by what is now called the crescentic margin of the crural arch. The attachment of the fascise to the bone, between this point and the tuberosity of the pubis, has been named Gimbernat's ligament—an appellation which, by convey- ing the idea of a distinct independent structure, has occasioned much confusion. Having ascertained this important anatomical fact, Gimbernat introduced a new method of relieving the stric- ture, which was to cut inwards from the neck of the sac towards the pubis. He operated very rudely, by passing a grooved director and bistoury between the intestine and stricture into the abdomen, and then separating them so as to make a very free division of the fasciae, and thus endanger the bladder, or even the uterus if distended. The principle of the operation, however, being good, was adopted in practice, and would probably long ere now have been invariably acted on, were it not that, in postABDOMEN. 355 mortem examinations of femoral hernias, the obturator artery has been found rising from the epigastric or external iliac and encircling the neck of the sack. This origin of the artery is now ascertained to be far from unusual, but there is reason to doubt that the vessel will often allow the hernia to protrude between it and the trunk from which it rises, so as to lie on the pubal side of the sac, and be in the way of the knife; and even though it were to be so situated, there seems little danger of cutting its coats in dividing the stricture, provided this part of the operation be properly performed. The tumour, which is generally very small, depends principally on fluid accumulated in the sac, and the portion of intestine subjected to strangulation is often no larger than the point of the finger ; but even though it should equal in size a pigeon's egg, which it seldom exceeds, a very slight dilatation of the stricture is sufficient for permitting reduction. Instead of the coarse and dangerous procedure of Gimbernat, therefore, the division of the tight edge of the fasciae should be effected very gently and cautiously. The surgeon having intro- duced his fore-finger into the sac close up to its neck, with the nail turned towards the intestine, feels for the crescentic margin of the fasciae, or rather for its situation, since in cases requiring an operation the stricture is too tight to permit the smallest part of the finger to be passed through. He then carries up a blunt- pointed slightly-curved bistoury along his finger, towards which the flat side is turned, and carefully insinuates its point within the stricture, which being accomplished, he turns the knife so as to direct the cutting edge to it; and if sufficient dilatation is not thus obtained, he presses the edge of the knife on the tense fibres without using any sawing motion. As room is gained, he presses his finger gradually forwards, until he feels that the point is fairly within the abdominal cavity, wlien he may be sure that enough has been done. It often happens that, immediately upon the return of the protruded viscera, a quantity of serous fluid escapes from the abdomen, which has an alarming appearance, but is not of the slightest consequence. The after-treatment of tlie patient should be conducted on the same principles which have356 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. been explained in regard to inguinal hernia. It may here not be improper again to notice the question, whether, in operating for hernia, it would not be better to relieve the stricture without cutting into the cavity of the peritoneum. The advantage con- tended for in favoiir of the latter practice is its lessening the risk of inflammatory consequences. In opposition to it many strong objections will readily appear—as, in the first place, the difficulty, or rather impracticability, of safely dividing a tight stricture without the assistance obained from introducing a finger into the sac as a guide for the knife; secondly, the inefficiency of pressure to reduce the protruded parts, unless the orifice through which they have escaped be rendered very free indeed, so long as it operates through the medium of fluid contained in a bag; {Iiirdly, the fear of returning the sac along with the viscera, in which case strangulation may still be maintained by its narrow neck; fourtlily, the ground for believing that the neck of the sac is in general much concerned in causing the strangulating constriction, so as to require division no less than the fascial stricture itself; and, lastly, the chance of returning the intestine in a state im- proper for reduction, or of being foiled in doing so from adhesions or other morbid changes, requiring free inspection, and the use of the knife for their removal. Umhilical Hernia. Children are sometimes bom with a malformation of the abdominal parietes, which exposes the peritoneum of the epi- gastric region to view, and allows the viscera to protrude, not- withstanding any pressure that may be employed to prevent them from doing so. Such imperfectly formed beings generally die soon after birth ; and if they survive, must labour perma- nently under the inconvenience which attends the improtected condition and displacement of their bowels ; all that art can do being to afford some mechanical support, where the parietes of the abdomen are defective, by means of a firm case of leather or other suitable material. But, independently of this defective structure, the viscera may be protruded through the umbilical357 ABDOMEN. aperture, or passage for the vessels of the foetus, the thin skiu which is formed after the separation of the cord being distended by the sac of peritoneum. Such an occurrence can take place only within a short period after birth, since the runbilical open- ing subsequently becomes obliterated, and occupied by a firm imyielding cicatrix. Hernia occasionally appears in the adult near the umbilicus; but then it is always situated in a preter- natural aperture, and is said to be Ventral. True umbilical hernia in the adult is always congenital In the treatment of this species of hernia, it is of great con- sequence that reduction should be effected and maintained while the apertva-e still retains its disposition to become obliterated, so that a radical cure may be effected, and the patient saved from the necessity of wearing a bandage permanently. In children, where there is no maKormation, and merely a relaxation of the umbilical opening, this may in general be easily accomplished, by returning the protruded viscera; then placing a conical- shaped compress, such as a nutmeg enveloped with lint, on the opening through which they passed; and, lastly, affording suffi- cient pressure by applying cross straps of adhesive plaster. This attains the object better than a circular bandage, which neces- sarily compresses the general cavity of the abdomen, and thus, though it counteracts the predisposition by strengthening the parietes, tends to excite the disease. In the slight degree of this. complaint usually met with in infants, which merely pre- sents the appearance of a thimble-lilce protrusion from the imibilicus, it is not necessary to employ any means of treatment, as the parts soon assume a normal state through spontaneous contraction. In adults such simple measures are not sulficient, and more powerful pressure is required. The best apparatus for the purpose consists of two broad circular cushions, one of which is placed on the back, and the other opposite the seat of the hernia, which may be connected by a spring with any requisite degree of force. Additional security for this bandage can be readily obtained, if found necessary, by means of straps passed under the perineum, or brought over the shoulders.358 PKINCIPLES or SURGERY. Incarcerated and strangulated umbilical hernia should be treated on the same priaciples as those which have been ex- plained. When the operation is judged requisite, a crucial in- cision should be made through the integuments, having the most prominent part of the tumour for its centre, unless the hernia is very large, when it will be sufiicient to make a simple incision two or three inches long, at the base of the swelling, directed towards the centre. The sac is to be exposed and opened in the same way that has been abeady described, and the stricture may be divided on any side, or, what is better, on several sides, so that no one is cut very extensively. The omentum is in this situation apt to cover the viscera, and ought to be carefully dis- engaged from them before being either cut away or reduced. Ventral Hernia. Wliat has been said regarding umbilical hernia mil apply in all respects to ventral hernia, with the exception, that, as the disease is almost exclusively confined to adults, some powerful means of compression are reqrdred. Protrusions of this kind are, not common, and when they do occur, are generally situated in the linea alba near the umbilicus; but the records of surgery shew, that they may take place in almost every part of the abdominal parietes. Hernia Dorsalis, or through the Ischiatic Notch, Hernia of the Foramen Ovale, and Hernia of the Perineum, are so ex- tremely rare that it does not seem necessary to detail the par- ticulars of the few cases in which they have been observed. In a case of perineal hernia that came tmder my notice, the patient, a middle-aged female, made a narrow escape, from having the tumour opened instead of an abscess. The swell- ing was larger than a turkey's egg, and lay between the anus ^ and tuberosity of the reqfam. ^ (clit-fvUvvw ) 1 ./a^a^u f rt>'t' / • Internal Hernia. Under this title are comprehended two conditions, very different in regard to their diagnosis and treatment. In one359 ABDOMEN. of them the strangulation is caused by the constriction of some preternatural adhesion or band, which has resulted from inflammation taking place within the abdominal cavity. On such occasions, interference, though occasionally attempted, does not seem warrantable, on account of the obscurity which must prevent the diagnosis from ever being quite certain, the difficulty of disentangling the intestine—often a tedious and operose pro- cess, even in the dead body—and the extreme danger resulting from such exposure, handling, and cutting of the viscera. Even in circumstances apparently the most desperate, the chance of spontaneous recovery must exceed that of escape from the effects of an operation attended with so much risk and so little promise of success. In the other form of the disease, which may more correctly be denominated Internal Hernia, the case is very different, the seat of constriction being the neck of a sac, which may be dis- tinctly recognised and is safely accessible. This sac is formed by protrusion of the peritoneum through one of the apertures of the abdominal parietes, which constitute the ordinary seat of hernia, more especially that of the inguinal canal, and produces the effect in question by having been reduced into the abdomen together with the portion of intestine contained in it. In one case that came under my care, the sac had not been protruded for many months previous to the symptoms of strangulation, and therefore may perhaps have for some time existed in an empty state. But in general this condition takes place during the period of strangulation, and is effected by external pressure employed for the taxis. The diagnosis is therefore rendered distinct by the symptoms persisting after the tumour disappears, and may usually be confirmed by carefully examining the seat of protrusion, where a sense of fulness or resistance is perceived when pressure is made over the internal tumour. When the history of the case and the existing sjonptoms afford ground for believing that the sac has been reduced, together with its strangulated contents, no time should be lost in affording relief. For this purpose, a free incision having been360 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. made, so as to expose the spermatic cord, the operator introduces his finger through the external ling imder the tendinous expan- sion of the external oblique muscle, and divides it directly up- wards with a blunt-pointed bistoury, to the extent of an inch or more, if necessary, to bring the bottom of the sac into view. It generally then protrudes, and admits of being treated as in ordi- nary cases of hernia; but if it does not do so, even when the patient coughs, may be readily seized with forceps, and drawn fairly into view. In the case above alluded to, where the strangu- lation had taken place within the abdomen, I found no difficulty in executing the process as just described, and with complete success. It is matter of much regret that this mode of relief has been adopted in a comparatively small proportion of the cases requiring it which have hitherto occurred, and in general at a period of the disease so advanced as to preclude any chance of recovery; but the attention which has of late years been devoted to the subject will, it is hoped, render the practice in future more satisfactory and creditable to the art of surgery. Iliac Abscess. Collections of matter are sometimes formed in the iliac or inguinal regions, lying between the parietes of the abdomen and the peritoneum. As the gut on the right side is in tliis situation partly uncovered with peritoneum, there is a risk of ulcerative absorption being induced in its coats by the pressure of the con- fined fluid, so as to form a preternatural opening into the caput ccemm, which may become a stercoraceous fistula if the integu- ments also give way. To prevent this occurrence, it is right m such cases to make an early aperture. This complaint is met with most 'frequently in females soon after delivery, but is not confined to this condition; and I have even met with it, though certainly very seldom, in patients of the other sex. The abscess is generally of a subacute character, and, from its insidious for- mation, is apt to escape recognition.PELVIS. 361 CHAPTEK XVTII. PELVIS. Imperforate Anus. Deficiency or imperforation of the anus is a congenital disease, and exhibits several varieties wluch must be distinguished in practice. Sometimes the rectum is completely formed, with the exception of having its orifice closed by a thin membrane, which allows the dark colour of the meconium to be discerned through it. This obstruction, instead of existing at the extremity of the gut, may be situated a little above it, so as to require the intro- duction of a finger for its discoveiy. The recti;m is also occasion- ally found to be deficient at its lower part, becoming nearly or altogether impervious at the distance of an inch or more from where the anus ought to be. In such cases, there is not unfre- quently a communication between the intestine above the ob- structed part and the vagina of the female, or the urinary bladder of the male, the former of which complications has sometimes proved sufficient for affording passage from the bowels during the course of a long life. The symptoms of imperforate anus are swelling and tension of the abdomen, vomiting, and absence of the usual evacuations from the bowels. If the child is not relieved by having an aperture effected for the escape of the confined feculent matters, it must speedily perish,—and an examination of the rectum should therefore be always instituted without delay, when there are symptoms indicative of obstruction, and more especially when there is no discharge of meconium. Tn case of simple closure, without deficiency of the gut, the membrane should be freely divided in a crucial direction with a362 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. probe-poi^^ted bistoury, guided on the finger. To prevent contrac- tion of the wound, it will be necessary to introduce daily, untU the cure is completed, a tent of lint smeared with some unctuous matter. If there is no appearance of an anus, and the lower part of the rectum is wanting, the prognosis must be very unfavour- able, since such a malformation is usually associated with other imperfections of the system ; and though it should not be so complicated, is remedied with great difficxilty, as the opening made by incision through the integuments and subjacent tissues, even if it reaches the rectum, and suffices in the first instance for allowing the evacuations, is very apt to contract, or become almost obliterated, notwithstanding every care that can be taken to prevent it from doing so. The child should be placed upon its back, and have its thighs held up so as to expose the parts fairly to view. The surgeon then makes an incision about an inch in length in the mesial plane, having its posterior extremity about half an inch distant from the os coccygis. Making way with the knife, he introduces his finger in the direction of the hollow of the sacrum,—and if the gut is near, he will discover it by the fluc- tuation of its contents. If he succeds in puncturing the coats of the intestine, the opening is to be enlarged to a suitable extent, and prevented from closing by the introduction of a tent. But if he faUs in finding the gut within the distance of at most two inches from the surface, he need not prosecute the search further. In cases where a communication exists between the rectum and bladder or vagina, assistance may be derived in discoveriug the obstructed extremity by introducing a director through the pre- ternatural passage into the cavity of the intestine. There are some cases on record in which life has been preserved by cutting into the colon, but such attempts can hardly be recommended. Stricture of the Rectum. Stricture of the rectum sometimes, but very rarely, exists as a congenital imperfection, and almost always depends upon changes in the stmcture of the coats of the intestine taking place in the progress of life, especially during its middle and laterPELVIS. 363 periods. Like stricture of the cesopliagus, it may be caused either by simple contraction, with thickening and induration of the gut, or by morbid degeneration of its constituent tissues, in which case the resulting tumour is usually of a carcinoma- tous nature. The symptoms of simple stricture are painful and imperfect evacuations of the bowels,—the desire to empty the rectum con- tinuing after the most powerful and prolonged efforts of expul- sion,—the discharge of fluid matters with great force, as if from a squirt,—the appearance of the sohd evacuations in the form of slender cylinders or small round masses,—and the admixture of a large quantity of mucus, often bloody, with the feculent excre- tions. The disease generally manifests itself very insidiously, and before long is usually accompanied with a distended state of the abdomen, which is owing partly to retention of the intestinal contents, and partly to a tympanitic condition induced by the irritation. The desire to empty the bowels becomes at length almost incessant, and the frequent attempts which are made to do so being seldom followed by any evacuation except of fluids, there is a risk of erroneously supposing that the patient labours under diarrhcea, and with this view of prescribing astringent or other kinds of constipating medicines, which have a tendency to increase the distension of the intestine. In all cases of doubt, an • examination should be made with the finger, to ascertain positively whether or no there be a stricture. It is generally found about two inches or two inches and a haK distant from the orifice, and very rarely higher up; although some practi- tioners allege that they are able to detect constrictions even in the sigmoid flexure of the colon. But the greatest tact and dexterity cannot insure even a moderate approach to certainty, in exploring the widtli of a canal so capacious and loosely con- nected as the upper part of the rectum, as the coats are extremely apt to be pushed before the point of the bougie, and lead to the belief that there is a stricture when none exists. It is often erroneously supposed that a stricture can be felt about five or six inches up the gut, owing to the resistance caused by the promon-PKINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. 364 tory of the sacrum to the iiitroductiou of a bougie. The diffi- culty of obtaining satisfactory evidence as to the existence of stricture in these situations is the less to be regretted, as it is almost always seated witliin reach of the finger, which cannot be deceived; and if beyond this extent, may be deemed quite irre- mediable. Unless the patient be relieved, general emaciation is gradually induced by the continual distress and derangement of the intestinal functions. Hectic irritation follows, and death may be the ultimate effect, either from gradual exliaustion or from inflammation of the bowels. The progress of the disease is usually very slow, and years may elapse before the symptoms are sufficiently severe to excite attention, their insidious approach rendering the patient unaware of their presence, even when dis- tinctly marked. In carcinomatous contraction of the rectum, the patient suffers the symptoms which have been described, and also those attendant upon that kind of morbid degeneration, viz., lancinatuig pains, not constant but severe, an almost cartilaginous- hardness of the rectum, wliich is felt if the finger be introduced to the diseased part, and frequently extends to the skin surround- ing the anus; also, when the disease has advanced to the ulcer- ated stage, a fetid sanious discharge from the anus, together with involuntary evacuation of thin feculent matters. In females, a commimication with the vagina is often established, and allows the contents of the bowel to escape by it. The appearance of the patient further characterises the nature of the case, being thin and cachectic-looking, and exhibiting the greenish-yellow com- plexion usually observed in persons labouring mider malignant disease. In treating simple stricture of the rectum, if it should appear that the contraction depends on congenital malformation, which, it is important to know, sometimes escapes observation mitil an advanced period of life, the best course is to divide tlie constric- tion freely with a knife, and afterwards interpose dressing suffi- cient to prevent immediate closure of the wound or its subsequent contraction. But if the stricture be the result of diseased action in the coats of the gut, which has caused thickening and indura-PELVIS. 365 tion of them, the best remedy consists in the introduction of bougies successively increased in size, which, by inducing inter- stitial absoi-ption in the parietes of the intestine, gradually restores them to a natural state. Bougies for this purpose are employed of various materials, such as steel, elastic gum, wood, and glass. The two first are the best. They should be slightly curved to facilitate their entrance into the rectum, and, if metallic, have a bulging extremity to render their passage through the stricture more distinctly perceptible. Before being used, they ought to be heated by immersion in warm water, and anointed with some unctuous substance. There is no advantage in allowing them to remain for any length of time after being in- troduced. They should therefore be immediately withdra-mi, and ought not to be employed again before an interval of three or four days. Cancer of the rectum, is no less incurable than in other situations, and, of course, could not be excised without inflicting a mortal wound, unless of small extent, and confined to the verge of the anus ; all, therefore, that can be done for the patient in such unhappy circumstances, is soothing the irritation of the disfease by opiate injections, the hip-bath, and gentle laxatives. Fissures and Ulcers of the Rectum. M. Boyer, in his System of Surgery, describes, under the title of'Ger9ure, or fissure of the anus, a very troublesome affection, which had previously been almost entirely overlooked. It con- sists, according to him, of one or more small superficial ulcerated chops, lying in the direction of the radiated folds of the anus, but rather more internally, so as not to be visible without a forcible separation of the nates. The distinctive symptoms of the disease are—pain in the region of the anus, aggravated during evacuation of the bowels, and such a close constriction of the sphincter as renders the introduction of a finger, or even a much smaller body, insufferably painful. It may occur at any age, but is most fre- quently met with at and before the middle period of life, and in males much more frequently than females. The patient at first merely feels pain coming on some time after evacuation of the366 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. rectum, and suffers no further inconvenience in the intervals between these attacks, which may be of several hours' duration. As the disease advances, he experiences more severe and con- tinued distress ; pressure of any kind, as that which proceeds from sitting, occasions great uneasiness ; and constipation is induced, which, by causing induration of the feculent matters, renders the symptoms still more intense. Mucus, sometimes tinged with blood, is copiously discharged ; when the nates are separated, the anus appears to be absent, owing to the close con- traction wliich it suffers from the inordinate action of the muscle ; and if an attempt is made to introduce the finger, the patient involuntarily springs beyond the surgeon's reach. Any circiim- stances productive of local or general irritation tend to aggravate the patient's suffering ; and those of an opposite kind occasion- ally procure for him intervals of comparative ease. The pain is especially referred to the situations which the chops occupy. The causes of the disease are not well ascertained. Tor the cure of this complaint, Boyer considered it necessaiy to divide the Sphincter ani, and such has been deemed the only certain means of remedy. Beginning my practice under this impression, I gradually limited the extent of incision, and since 1832 have felt warranted to state, that so far from division of the whole muscle being required, cutting the mucous membrane alone is sufiB.cient. In short, the essential of the operation is, converting the fissure into an incision ; and for this purpose, in- stead of the deep gash described by M. Boyer, I merely insert the point of a sharp-pointed curved bistoury at the lower end of the chop, and bring it out at the other extremity, so as to pass under the base and insure its complete division. The small wound thus inflicted scarcely requires any dressing, and the patient is at once relieved. There is a form of this disease which frequently occurs, but is less easily recognised, though the symptoms are well marked, and the sufferings of the patient so great that its discovery is of no small consequence, especially as the remedy is equally simple and certain. This is an lilcer seated immediately -witldn thePELVIS. 367 sphincter, where, of course, it cannot be brought into view by the most forcible separation of the nates, and admits of detection only by examination with the finger gently introduced, and carried round the circumference of the gut, so as to feel the con- dition of its surface. The ulcer has an elongated form, and rarely exceeds half an inch in length, not deep, but indurated at the margin, which facilitates its recognition. The patient's acute pain, when pressure is made on the ulcerated surface, also assists in the examination. The symptoms of this ulcer of the rectum are similar to those attending fissures of the anus. There is the same pain after going to stool,—the same uneasiness in sitting, when the patient may be observed to rest with one hip on the corner of liis chair, —and the same slimy discharge from the bowels. Uneasy feel- ings in the urinary organs are very generally complained of, especially a disagreeable sensation in the perineum, and frequent desire to make water, with more or less pain in doing so. I have met with instances of twenty or thirty years' misery from this source, aggravated by an endless variety of treatment, directed to the urethra by practitioners ia this department of practice both at home and abroad. When the presence of such an ulcer has been recognised, the patient may be relieved by the following no less simple than certain procedure. The operator having gently insinuated the point of his fore-finger, well-oiled, far enough to feel the exact situation and extent of the ulcerated surface, places the point of the sharp curved bistoury at the margin of the anus, and pushes it upwards so as to pass under the base and issue into the gut above tlie summit of the ulcer, after which the incision is com- pleted. It thus resembles that which has been described above for the remedy of Fissures, and requires the same treatment, or, rather, is equally independent of any. Foreign Bodies in the Rectum. Foreign bodies are introduced into the rectum either by descending through the intestinal canal, or by being forced through368 PRINCIPLES or SURGERY. the anus. They are prevented from escaping by their size, or shape, or by both of these circumstances. Concretions of indi- gestible matters, swallowed along with the food, or indurated masses of the ordinary feculent substance, may obstruct the gut. Fisli-bones and other hard bodies of a spicular form, after passing through the whole length of the intestines, are sometimes detained by the sphincter ani. Pieces of wood, glass, earthenware, and other matters, have been accidentally lodged in the rectum, by patients endeavouring to procure evacuation of their bowels, and still more rude articles have been forced into it in consequence of falls on the breech. The symptoms of dourse vary with the bulk and figure of the foreign body. If it merely obstructs the passage, the patient suffers only from constipation, together with more than usual uneasiness and sensation of weight in the region of the rectum ; and if the coats of the gut are punctured or lacerated, the additional symptoms of bloody mucus, or blood dis- charged by stool, and pain more or less acute, will indicate the nature of the case. But the only method of acquiring certain information as to the state of matters is to make an examination with the finger, and this ought always to be done -when there is any reason to suspect the existence of a local cause of irritation or obstruction in the rectum. For effecting the removal of foreign bodies from the rectum, different means must be employed, according to the circumstances of the case. Feculent masses should be broken down with a scoop, or spoon, and extracted by the same means. Hard, pointed substances are best withdrawn by straight or slightly-curved forceps, guided with the finger, so as first to dislodge, and then extract them. If they cannot be got out entire, another pair of forceps should be employed to break them into fragments, while the principal portion is held steady with those first introduced. When the dif&culty proves extreme, it will be much better to make a free division of the integuments and sphincter, than sub- ject the intestine to the risk of injury from violent efforts at extraction.369 PELVIS. Hemorrhoids. By Hemorrlioids, or Piles, are understood tumours of different kinds which are met with at the verge of the anus, either without or within the sphincter,—in the former of which cases they are said to be external, and in the latter internal. They sometimes depend on a varicose condition of the hemorrhoidal veins, which form round, tense, dark-coloured swellings,—but they more fre- quently consist of a morbid growth of the skin or mucous mem- brane, and subjacent cellular tissue. When external, they are of a round or flattened form, and except when suffering from in- flammation, possess the natural appearance and consistence of the part. When internal, they are very vascular, generally of a florid colour, and uneven on the surface like a strawberry. Ex- ternal hemorrhoids occasionlittle inconvenience,unless irritated or inflamed, when they become much enlarged, round, tense, and extremely painful, especially if subjected to pressure. But those of the internal kind are productive of more continued distress, by protruding from slight exertions, bleeding at stool, or exciting- sympathetic uneasiness in the urinary organs. These symptoms are not always equally severe, but, while hardly ever absent alto- gether, are apt to suffer occasional exacerbations, in consequence of general or local irritation. They exist sometimes together, sometimes separately, and one patient may complain merely of protrusion of the bowel, or bleeding from it, while another refers his sufferings entirely to the bladder. The disease is often not detected until an examination is made by the surgeon, and this therefore should always be done when the symptoms are at all suspicioiis. The circumstances that chiefly tend to produce, and also aggra- vate, hemon-hoidal excrescences, are excitement of the digestive and generative organs, constipation, sedentary occupations, preg- nancy, and exposure to cold or wet, which, by deranging tlie actions of the system, is apt to excite local inflammation, especially in parts having already a morbid disposition. It follows that the most effectual means of preventing the disease consist in 2 BPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 370 using regular diet and exercise, avoiding excesses of every kind, and obviating constipation, if it should occur, by suitable medicine or regimen. Similar attention will palliate the symptoms ; but during the paroxysms it is often necessary to maintain the hori- zontal posture, to facilitate the evacuation of the bowels, by ad- nunistering laxative doses of castor oil and emollient injections, and to allay the inflammatory condition of the parts affected by warm fomentations, the hip-bath, and leeches applied round the margin of the anus. Much relief is obtained in the chronic state of the complaint, by the regular use of cold water after evacua- tion of the bowels. But to effect a radical cure it is necessary to remove the excrescences, which may be done by the knife or ligature, accordingly as the disease is external or internal. In regard to external piles there can be no doubt that excision is the preferable mode, being much more speed}'-, and attended with less pain. It may be performed either with a knife or scissors, while the excrescence is held steady with a hook, forceps, or the finger and thumb. There is seldom bleeding of any consequence, and if a vessel should throw out a jet, it can be readUy tied. The excision of hemorrhoids from Avithin the sphincter, owing to the greater vascularity in this situation, and the difficulty of apply- ing pressure or styptics to the cut surface, is attended with the danger of hemorrhage so profuse as to be very alarming, or even prove fatal, and is also apt to excite a no less dangerous in- flammation. In such cases the ligature ought to be preferred, as it is perfectly safe, and has the advantage of so altering the structure of any portion of the excrescence that may have been permitted to remain, as to prevent a relapse of the disease. When the patient, by straining at stool, has caused the whole mass of excrescences to protrude, the surgeon should tie them close to their roots with silk threads as tightly as he can. He may do this either by transfixing them at the base with a needle, and then including a half of each in one of the threads, or if they are small, seizing them with a hook or forceps, and applying single ligatures. The everted gut and tumours should then be carefuUy replaced, and the patient should not quit the horizontal posture371 PELVIS. until the ligatures separate. If lie suffers much irritation, which is seldom the case, he will derive most relief from doses of the muriate of morphia, repeated as often as may be necessary, and the hip-bath. Eetention of urine is a frequent consequence of the operation, and may require the introduction of a catheter. In the piles depending upon a varicose state of the veins, relief may be afforded during the inflammatoiy paroxysm by puncturing the distended vessels and squeezing out their coagulated contents. Polypus of the Rectum. Vascular growths from the mucous lining of the rectum, hav-. iag a rounded form, and narrow elongated neck, so as to resemble a cherry, are occasionally met with in the vicinity of the anus. They protrude at stool, and occasion various unpleasant feelings, besides sometimes giving rise to copious hemorrhage. They should be removed by ligatures, which may be applied either simply or by transfixion.' Prolapsus Ani. Prolapsus Ani denotes a protrusion of the intestinal coats through the anus, so as to constitute an external tumour. The extent to which tliis occurs varies from the slightest eversion of the mucous membrane immediately within the sphincter, to the descent of the whole thickness of the gut for a considerable part of its length. Whatever portion is forced beyond the sphincter has its circulation impeded, and consequently becomes thickened and livid. Wlien the mucous membrane alone is everted, it presents the appearance of a ring ; but when there is prolapsus of all the coats, the tumour is globular, varying from the size of an egg to that of a child's head, and affords a copious secretion of bloody mucus, which very much resembles red currant jelly. Prolapsus of the whole thickness of the gut, or what may be called complete prolapsus, occurs chiefly in children and aged persons, especially females of relaxed frame. That of the inner membrane, or partial prolapsus, is generally observed in the vigour of life. The exciting causes of the former are, in children, severe372 PKINCIPLES or SURGERY. or long-continxied straining at stool; and in adults., generally, violent exertions, as ia. lifting weights on tlie back. Some local irritation, as that of ascarides in the rectum, or stone in the bladder, is often concerned in producing the disease in young persons, especially when it attains a great extent. The partial prolapsus, which is usually met with in adults, depends upon the presence of hemorrhoids. An attentive consideration of the circumstances which have just been mentioned will indicate the preventive and remedial measures that promise to be most beneficial. In treating the complete prolapsus of children, it is necessary, in the first place, to remove any local source of irritation that may be discovered to exist; and, should there not appear to be some such excitiug cause, the patient must be prevented from straining long or vio- lently at stool, by having his bowels kej)t in an easy state, and by being placed on an elevated seat, which will not permit his feet to touch the ground, and consequerrtly render it difficult for him to bend his body forwards, which makes the pressure of the diaphragm act more directly on the contents of the pelvis. The partial protrusion that occurs in adults, requires for its remedy the removal of hemorrhoidal excrescences, whether ex- ternal or internal,—the prevention of constipation by suitable regimen and medicine,—and the use of injections thrown into the rectum. When there is much relaxation, and consequent tendency to prolapsus, it wiU be observed that th'B integuments round the margin of the anus, when the gut has been replaced, are not tense and smooth, but loose, and thrown into radiating folds. M. Dupuytren proposed to cut away some of these folds, and, by thus diminishing the extent of the redundant sldn, wldle consolidation of the remainder was induced by the adhesive process foUowiug the inflammation excited by the operation, radically cure the disease. Mr. Hey of Leeds, with a similar view, removed the whole of the loose skin. This excision is easily performed, and generally proves effectual. Sometimes the ring of the prolapsed membrane, from inflaming, becomes permanently protruded, and the patient, who suffers constantPELVIS. 373 pain, can neither walk nor stand. In these circumstances, the whole of the protrusion may be removed by ligature with perfect safety and complete relief, immediate as well as permanent. The disease is best treated, however, when in its ordinary state, and free from inflammation. It is then easy to ascertain the exact extent of hemorrhoidal swelling concerned, and employ the requisite measures. In every case, the whole of the internal piles should be removed by ligatures, and after they have been tied, any of the external kind that appear are to be carefully cut away, together with the loose redundant integument surrounding the orifice of the gut. In aU operations at this part, it should be a rule never to leave any hemorrhoidal growth, either external or internal, since the portion permitted to remain will be almost sure to inflame and prove troublesome. The tumour that is formed by prolapsus of the whole thick- ness of the intestine, whether occurring in children or adults, is in general very readily reduced by slight pressure, provided the expulsive efforts have ceased, and the patient assumes the hori- zontal posture. Occasionally, however, from the parts being allowed to remain for hours, or even days protruded, the intes- tinal coats become greatly thickened, consequently increasing the size of the swelling, and rendering replacement of the gut more dif&cult. A manipulation, similar to that of the taxis, must then be carefully employed, after the surface of the tumour has been lubricated with oil. The neck, or part next the anus, is steadily compressed with the flngers, and then pushed upwards through the ring which is formed by the sphincter. Successive portions are to be returned in the same way, until the remaining portion is so small as to admit of being pushed up at once. Fistula in Ano. Abscesses frequently form in the neighbourhood of the anus, and, when evacuation is allowed to take place natiu-aUy by ulce- rative absorption, the opening is generally external; but some- times it is formed through the gut, and not unfrcqueutly there is both an external and internal aperture, the formation of the374 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. latter being usually secondary to tliat of the former. After the matter is discharged, the cavity of the abscess very rarely heals spontaneously, but remains contracted in its capacity and thick- ened in its parietes, constituting a sinus, which is named Fistula in Ano. The fistula is said to be Blind External, Blind Internal, or Complete, accordingly as it has merely an external or internal opening, or both the one and the other. The external orifice is variously situated, but generally exists at one side, and is seldom either before or beliind the anus. It is. usually small, and sur- rounded by an elevated induration, more or less distinct. The internal opening was formerly thought eqiially variable in respect to its distance from the anus, and was searched for at the highest part to wliich the sinus reached. M. Eibes (1820) ascei-tained the important fact, that, if existing at all, it is almost invariably seated about an inch or little more from the anus, and can hence be brought nearly or altogether into view by forcibly separating the nates. It is generally small, and often extremely so, with difliculty permitting a probe to pass. The symptoms of the primary abscess are pain, hardness, and slight diffused swelling in the neighbourhood of the anus, from which relief is obtained upon a discharge of matter taking place externally, or from the gut. There is great variety in the degree of acuteness, and in the progress of the disease, the pain being sometimes very severe, and at others hardly perceptible, while evacuation may be accomplished in the course of -a week, or not until the expiration of months. The remaining sinus affords a thin discharge, which is sometimes very copious, and at others so scanty that the patient might suppose he had got quite well, were it not for a slight staining of the linen, and an uneasy sen- sation felt now and then in the parts affected. The unceasing action of the sphincter, which tends to separate the sides of the sinus, and the passage of liquid or gaseous matters from the in- testine through it, not only prevent the cavity from closing, but render its parietes thick and callous from the interstitial effusion of lymph, which is induced by the continued irritation thus occasioned.PELVIS. 376 The causes of abscess in this situation are chiefly the inflam- mation of hemorrhoids, remaining long in a sitting posture, con- stitutional disturbance, and local irritation from foreign bodies arrested in the rectum. Males are more subject to the disease than females, who comparatively rarely suffer from it. It occurs most frequently during the vigour of life, between twenty and fifty years of age, and is very often met with in phthisical per- sons, whether owing to tlie ii-ritation that is occasioned by the morbid state of the lungs, or dependent on the ulceration of the intestines, which generally exists in such cases, it is difl&cult to decide. Children, and even infants, are not exempt from it. In treating the inflammation which precedes the abscess, bleeding from the part is never found to be productive of any advantage, and, on the contrary, seems to have an injurious effect in rendering the morbid process more slow and unmanage- able. Warm fomentations, gentle laxatives, and emollient injec- tions, afford most relief, and if they do not succeed in resolving the inflammatory action, hasten its termination in suppuration. When fluctuation can be distinctly perceived, a free opening should be made with the knife to prevent extension of the matter in the cellular substance, after which a poultice may be applied for a few days, and then simple dressing. Various methods have been followed in treating the subsequent sinuses or fistulas. Injections and ointments of every sort have been inti'odiiced into them, but seldom if ever with any permanent advantage; and it is now admitted, that, except through means of the knife, a cure is next to impracticable. Incisions were formerly practised with another view, which was to remove the callous walls of the cavity, from the erroneous idea that they depended upon a peculiar morbid action, instead of being simply the result of continued irritation. The practice founded on this mistaken principle was no less unsatisfactory than severe, as the recovery after operation always required a long time, and often proved incomplete. Simple division of the septum between the sinus and gut, which is the practice now employed, has been per- formed in a manner much more painful, difficult, and uncertain376 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGEIIY. thau was necessaiy. This arose from its being thought requisite to cut the gut as high up as the sinus extended, and to dress the wound with irritating applications, in order to promote the removal of its callous edges and surface. It is now known, that the induration depends entii-ely upon the irritation of the sinus ; also, that the internal opening is always very near the orifice of the gut; and that it is sufficient to divide the pai-t of the septum which lies between the external and internal openings; lastly, that unless the internal opening be comprehended in the incision, the division of the septum, however free, will fail in affording a permanent cure. It may be added, that where an internal open- ing does not exist, a remarkable thinness of the septum, wliich seems here to consist merely of the mucous membrane, is always observed at the place where the aperture is usually situated, and in such cases it is found sufficient to cut thus far. The opera- tion which is now performed for fisUda in ano being established on these principles, is extremely simple and easy, and is not attended with either much pain or any risk of bleeding. It does not require the complicated instruments formerly emjployed, and is readily effected by a blunt-pointed curved bistoury. The patient should be placed with his body bent forward, and his arms leant on a table or the back of a chair, unless the fistula is on the left side of the anus, and the surgeon cannot use the bistoury with his left hand, in which case the patient must be laid on his back with the thighs drawn up. The surgeon intro- duces his fore-finger into the gut, and then searches with a probe in the fistula for its internal opening, or, if there is none, for the thin denuded membrane where it would be, if present. Having withdrawn the probe, he insinuates the bistoury, carefully con- veys its point through the internal opening, or, if none exists, pushes it through the septum, and then, resting the back of the blade upon his finger, brings the point of the knife out at the anus, after which the septum may be divided quicldy and easily. In difficult cases it is better to let the probe remain, and cut it out while still passed through the internal opening. Any sinuses running into the hip or perineum ought next to be laid open.PELVIS. 377 Pieces of lint should be placed between tlie cut edges, and renewed for a few days until granulation is establisbed, when superficial dressings are sufficient. In cases of blind internal fistula, which are rare, it would be found very difficult to comply with the dii-ections generally given, to guide a probe up the gut into the sinus, and make its point protrude in the hip, to shew where the knife should be introduced to make the fistula com- plete. Such a process is fortunately quite unnecessary, as the seat of the sinus can always be readily recognised by its softness, compared with the firmness of the surrounding parts, especially those in the immediate neighbourhood, which constitute the walls of the cavity, and are indurated by the effusion of lymph. At the centre of this part, which is felt most soft and yielding, an incision should be made, and then the operation may be com- pleted, as if there had been an external opening in the first instance. Fistula in ano, depending upon caries of the sacrum, or con- nected with phthisis, is of course incurable; but partial relief may often be afforded by giving the matter free vent for its discharge. It may be observed, that when the obstinacy of the fistula depends on other causes besides those of a local kind, and particularly the one last mentioned, the external orifice is gene- rally large, and surrounded with thin flabby integuments. Retention of Urine. .1. Retention from deficienexj in the expulsive power of the Bladder. The urinary bladder may be weakened in various ways, so as to effect the evacuation of its contents imperfectly, or not at aU. Mere inordinate and long;contmuei,.di8tension^ by over-stretch- ing the muscular fibres, destroys, more or less completely and permanently, the contractility of the organ, and in a con-espond- ing degree renders the patient unable to void his urine. When the retention is complete, the bladder is distended until it con- tains several pounds, and forms a large tumour, which may be seen and felt in the hypogastric region. The ureters and pelvis378 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY. of the kidneys then become distended, after which the secretion of urine being opposed by the pressure of that already accumu- lated, the patient's state remains without much alteration, until evacuation is effected artificially, or takes place through ulcerative absorption of the coats of the bladder. In this state the patient suffers inexpressible distress from a constant desire to empty his bladder, and from the incessant efforts, violent but abortive, which it induces him to make. Small quantities of water dribble away by drops from time to time, as the secretion slowly proceeds, but the tumour suffers no diminution of size or tension. Exposure to cold or wet, and injuries of the spine, give rise to the same powerless condition of the bladder; and if tliere be any mechanical obstacle to excretion previously existing, as from stricture of the urethra, swelling of the prostate gland, or tumours pressing on the canal, or if the expulsive power of the bladder be weaker than usual, this effect is still more readily produced. In old age the bladder is apt to lose its tone and expel the urine imperfectly. The patient observes that he makes water more freqiiently than before,—that he does so in smaller quantity at one time,—that the stream is not forcible, but small and dribbling,—and that he passes more or less of it during his sleep. It is the last symptom which generally first attracts notice and leads to the more careful attention that detects the others. The obvious explanation of it is, that the bladder never being fully emptied, but merely having the excess expelled, which its feeble power, aided by the compression of the ab- dominal muscles, is able to command, and becoming distended beyond this extent during sleep, while the resistance of the voluntary muscles at the neck and membranous part of the urethra is no longer opposed to its evacuation, the water flows away gently without awakening the patient. The treatment of this palsied state of the bladder, whatever be its cause or degree, absolutely requires, in the first place, that the water should be dra,wn off, since it is only by being allowed to contract that the muscular fibres can recover their usual power. This is effected by introducing a catheter, which may be eitherPELVIS. 379- flexible or rigid,—the former being made of elastic gum, and the latter of silver. Unless there is reason to suspect some morbid alteration in the width or direction of the urethra,—the mode of discovering and treating which will be explained hereafter,—an instrument should be selected equal in size to the ordinary width of the canal. Different surgeons prefer different curvatures of the catheter; but it may be observed in general that it is passed most readily when the bent part is short. The patient should be laid reclining, or made to stand erect with his back supported. The surgeon, holding the penis between the thumb and fingers of his left hand, introduces the point of the catheter, lubricated with oil, into the urethra, and pushes it gently onwards, at the same time stretching the penis until it reaches the bulb. He then relinquishes his hold of the penis with the left hand, applies the points of its fingers to the perineum at the verge of the anus, and bringing the catheter into the direction of the mesial j)lane, withdraws the handle from the abdomen, so as to make the point ascend from the dilatation at the biilb, into the more narrow membranous part of the canal. By simply continuing to de- press the handle, and supporting the perineum, or introducing his fore-finger into the rectum, so as to elevate the point more effectually, he conveys the catheter fairly into the bladder. A surgeon who is practised in the operation will find it more con- venient, when the patient is standing, to introduce the catheter as far as the bulb with the convexity upwards or towards the pubis; and then, by making the handle describe a semicircle, turn it into the same position as when passed thus far the other way. The subsequent part of the process should be conducted in the manner which has been already explained. The danger to be dreaded in performing this operation consists in forcing the point of the catheter through the lining membrane of the urethra into the spongy texture which surrounds it. The false passages thus made occur most frequently about four inches from the orifice, owing to the handle of the catheter being too soon depressed;—at the bulb, from its not being depressed sufficiently, whence the point is pushed between the membranous part of380 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. the xiretlira and the rectum;—and just before entering the neck of the bladder, from the point not being sufficiently elevated while urged forwards, which forces it into the substance of the prostate gland. Attention to these sources of error will guard the surgeon against making false passages, and enable him to avoid them if abeady formed. It seldom happens that one evacuation of the bladder is sufficient for the patient's recovery. He feels completely relieved at the time, but soon begins to suffer again from the symptoms of distension; as the bladder, even when in the soundest state previously, is slow in regaining its contractile power. The catheter, therefore, must be introduced once or twice a day, until it ceases to be required. If the cure should never be completed, as in cases where the palsy arising from distension is complicated with the weakness of old age, it wiU be requisite to draw off the water regularly, especially at bed-time, to prevent its involuntary discharge during sleep. 2. Rctmtion of Urine from Irritation and Spasmodic Contraction at the Neck of the Bladder. When the ordinary resistance to the passage of the urine is increased by inordinate contraction of the muscles, which in the healthy state oppose the expulsive power of the bladder, the fluid is retained, and gives rise to the same symptoms as in the former case, but generally in a very acute form. The muscles concerned in producing this effect are the sphincter^ of the bladder, and Wilson's muscles, which descend from the pubis and embrace the membranous part of the urethra. The causes which excite their excessive action are irritations, sometimes indirectly applied, as those proceeding froni exposure to cold, the use of stimulating food or drink, or the employment of cantharides; but more frequently of a local kind, as from inflammation of the extremity of the urethra, spreading back towards the bladder, or from the injurious effects of instruments introduced into the canal. If these circumstances operate on a person whose urethra is previ- ously diseased, and more especially if it should be already con-381 PELVIS. tracted from any cause, the retention of urine will of course be more readily and completely induced. From the nature of the exciting cii'cumstances, it may be inferred that, along with the muscular constriction, there is a thickening of the mucous mem- brane, depending on vascular engorgement, which contributes to the effect, and must be kept in view during the treatment. As the disease depends on irritation, soothing measures ought always to be employed in the first instance. MUd and anodyne injections thrown into the rectum, the hip-bath, and venesection, if the pulse should require it, often prove sufficient to afford relief. Should they fail in doing so, and the symptoms are urgent, it will be necessary to draw off the water by the catheter, since the additional irritation thus occasioned is more than counterbalanced by the good effect of emptying the bladder, which, when stimulated by distension, reacts upon the spasmodi- cally contracted muscles at' its neck, and increases their resist- ance. The instrument used on this occasion should be neither full-sized—as the urethra is not only compressed by the muscles, but also swollen and contracted—nor veiy small, as the excited and congested membrane is softer, and, consequently, more easily torn than usual. It should be passed very gently, and with great care to avoid the erroneous directions of its point, which have been mentioned above, and in this case are extremely apt to occasion breaches, that increase the difficulty of the operation, by exciting still more initation, by causing hemorrhage, and by misleading the surgeon in his future attempts. The relief afforded by evacuation is seldom permanent, the irritated state of the organs giving rise to a deceitful feeling of distension, and rendering the patient very soon desiroxis of having the catheter again introduced. To obviate these uneasy symptoms, an opiate injection ought to be thrown into the rectum immediately after the instrument is withdrawn; and the operation ought not to be repeated oftener than there may be reason to suppose that the urine has accumulated to an injurious extent. To counteract the constipating effect of the opium injection, and remove any source of irritation from the intestinal canal, a table-spoonful of castor-PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. 382 oil should be given every day or two, according to circumstances. The food of the patient should he of the least stimulating kind ; and he should drink freely of mucilaginous diluent tluids, such as barley-water, containing small quantities of carbonate of soda, —nitrous ether,—or camphor mixture. Bodily fatigue and ex- posure to cold must be strictly avoided. Strickire of the Urethra. Strictures of the urethra were formerly attributed to fleshy excrescences obstructing the canal, and spasmodic contraction of the fibres lying in the substance or on the external surface of the iirethra. It is now almost universally admitted that they invari- ably depend upon narrowing and thickening of the lining coat, from lymph being effused and organized in its interstices. There is thus produced a constriction, varying in tightness from the slightest perceptible diminution of capacity to almost complete closure,—and in extent, from the breadth of a thread to the length of an inch or more. In some very rare cases the stricture has been found on dissection to exhibit what is called a bridle form, there being a fibrous band stretched across from one side of the canal to the other, in consequence, no doubt, of lymph having been effused into the interior of the canal, and organized there. The most common seat of stricture is anterior to the bulb, about five inches from the orifice. The one next in fre- quency is between two and three inches from the orifice. The other situations particularly exposed to its occurrence are the neck of the glans and orifice of the urethra. Two or more strictures are often met with in the same urethra, but when this is the case, one of them in general proves the most confirmed of the whole. The cause of strictures can seldom be positively ascertained, except in cases of injury from external violence. There is no doubt that a very large proportion of them occur subsequently to gonorrhoea, but whether this be in consequence of the disease, or the means employed to remedy it, admits of question. It may be safely stated, that inflammation, or at all events excitement of the urethra, precedes the process whichPELVIS. 383 establishes the thickening and induration, and whatever tends to produce this condition of the membrane -will expose to the risk of stricture. Severe gonorrhoeas, in which the inflammation spreads back along the urethra,—irritating injections, allowed to enter the passage too far,—frequent indulgence in venery,—stone in the bladder or other parts of the urinary organs,—and habitual addiction to a diet that stimulates the parts concerned, may thus be regarded as causes of stricture. Besides this true organic stricture, the urethra is liable to a temporaiy constriction, which has usually been attributed to spasmodic contraction of the surrounding muscles, although con- gestion of the vessels may probably have a considerable share in producing the effect. Independently of the perineal muscles, however, there can be no doubt that the urethra, both in health and disease, possesses a contractile power, which, xmder the influence of irritating circunistances, may prove excessive, so as either to produce the symptoms of stricture, or to aggravate those proceeding from a permanent constriction. The symptoms of stricture are—1. Difficulty in making water, owing to the resistance which is opposed to its escape by the narrow part or parts of the canal. The bladder, therefore, is slowly emptied; and its muscular coat becomes greatly thick- ened, so as to present an appearance similar to that of the ventricles of the heart on their inner surface. 2. Small size of the stream, which is usually spiral, forked, or dribbling. 3. Pain, generally experienced during micturition, and seldom afterwards. 4. Frequent desire to evacuate the urine, which is most remark- able during the night, from the circumstance of persons in health not requiring to do so between the time of lying down and getting up. The patient also often complains of pain in coitu,—of a thin gleety discharge from the urethra,—of swelling and pain of one or both testicles,—of uneasiness about the loins and limbs, and of muscular weakness of the latter. He frequently sufiers feverish attacks of short duration, but considerable intensity, resembling in all respects the fits of an ague. It is observed that the severity of all these symptoms increases when thePRINCIPLES OF SURGKRY. 384 patient is subjected to irritation, whether general or local, and diminishes in opposite circumstances. A very distressing and not unfrcquent consequence of stric- ture in the urethra is abscess, followed by fistula of the perineum. The canal is always much dilated behind the contracted part, and sometimes suffers perforation from ulcerative absorption, so as to allow the urine to enter the cellular substance. But in- stead of being formed by this process, the abscess is much more frequently called into existence merely by the irritation result- ing from the stricture, which excites inflammation and suppura- tion in the cellular substance, or glands adjacent. In either case the result is the same ; and a sinus is formed, leading from the urethra, generally the membranous part of it, to the surface of the perineum. The urine, in a larger or smaller propoi'tion, passes through this preternatural canal, the parietes of which, owing to the continued irritation thus produced, become thick and hardened, so as to resemble cartilage. The urethra be- comes more and more contracted,—new abscesses are formed,— the number of sinuses is increased,—and at length the whole perineum is perforated with openings, which discharge pus mixed with urine, and the seminal fluid also if it happens to be ejected ; while all the neighbouring parts are not only thickened and in- durated, but almost constantly inflamed, and engaged in the formation of abscesses. The treatment of stricture, until lately, has been conducted chiefly through means of Caustic, Internal incision, and Dilata- tion. Caustic has had the support of many powerful advocates. Wiseman proposed it so long ago as in his day, under the sup- position that the disease depended on the growth of fleshy ex- crescences from the inner surface of the urethra. John Hunter recommended it for destroying the callous contracted state of the canal, which he more correctly regarded as the cause of ob- struction. Sir E. Home, LaUemand, and other surgeons of recent times, have earnestly supported it by their practice and writings. But from having been generally employed, it has now, in this country at least, fallen almost entirely out of use, which is notPELVIS. 385 surprising when its disadvantages are considered. The mode of application •usually practised was to insert a bit of lunar caustic, or potass, into the extremity of a wax bougie, and fix it in its place by pressing down the edges of the excavation made for its reception. The bougie was then passed quickly down to the stricture, the seat of which had been previously ascertained, and allowed to remain pressed against the obstruction for a few seconds, so as to let the escharotic effect be produced. The operation being repeated as frequently as the irritation induced by it permitted, at length enabled a full-sized instrument to pass. It may be readily imagined that the process of cure thus con- ducted was necessarily very tedious, painful, and dangerous. The successive applications of the caustic required intervals of several days, and the cure was seldom completed without very many operations of this kind; sometimes a hundred, or more. The irritation produced by the caustic not only excited excessive pain, but subjected the patient to the risk of complete retention of urine, swelled testicle, and other bad consequences; and if the caustic happened to drop out of the bougie, violent inflam- mation, with various injurious effects on the neighbouring parts, abscess of the perineum, etc., were apt to be induced. Modern improvements in the apparatus for applying the caustic have in some measure obviated these objections. Instead of being carried down to the stricture by the simple but insecure means above mentioned, it has been introduced into the strictured por- tion of the canal more accurately, safely, and efficiently, by various instruments, constriicted on the following principle :— A catheter, straight or curved, of full size, has a small perfora- tion in its roimd extremity, to which a wire is fitted, so that when pressed at the handle of the instrument, it may be caused to project. This wire has a slit a little way from the point for receiving the caustic, and when thrust out at the opening of the catheter, after it has been pushed down to the seat of the stricture, will, if successfully managed, apply the escharotic substance to the surface of the morbidly contracted part of the canal. But although the application may thus be rendered more secure from 2 cPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 386 harm, its beneficial effects are still in the highest degree unsatis- factory. Division of the stricture by internal incision has been pro- posed and practised at various times, by introducing a canula with enclosed lancet blade, which may be protruded after the sheath has been conveyed down to the stricture. Mr. Stafford advocated this operation, and improved it by the invention of ingenious instruments for its performance; but the objections which have been alleged to the caustic apply stiU more strongly to such a mode of treatment, since it can never be safe, even ia the hands of the most expert operator, and has proved to be pro- ductive at the best of only temporary benefit. A French sur- geon named Eeybard has modified this process by using instruments of an enormous size, the canula being equal to a bougie of the full magnitude, and containing a blade large enough to cut through not only the urethra but also the corpus spongiosum. The disastrous effects of such a preposterous engine are fortunately prevented by the obvious impracticability of its employment for the remedy of stricture. Another mode of inci- sion has been long practised for contractions deemed imprac- ticable. This was named Boutonniere, or the button-hole operation, and consisted in passing a bougie or catheter down to the obstruction, and cutting beyond its point, so as to open the distended canal. It was extremely embarrassing in the execution, very dangerous from the risk of hemorrhage and ex- travasation of urine, and hardly productive of more than tem- porary relief. Dilatation has been long employed to remove strictures of the urethra, and even before it was known to be the cause of amendment. When fleshy excrescences were regarded as the source of obstruction, bougies, armed with caustic, or medicated as it was termed, with various ingredients believed to have the power of promoting absorption, were introduced into the passage. The caustic, no doubt, produced its peculiar effects, but the otlaer materials were found at length to be quite useless; and it be- came apparent that the good effects which attended their em-387 PELVIS. ployment depended entirely iipon tlie mechanical pressure of the instrument. Though the direct effect of a bougie is merely mechanical, the removal of the stricture depends on a vital pro- cess which is thus excited, and not on simple stretching. The pressure excites interstitial absorption of the thickened walls of the canal, and hence it is, that when an instrument of a certain .size has been passed with difficulty, a larger one can often be readily introduced by a subsequent attempt a few days after- wards. Such being the mode in which benefit is derived from the use of simple bougies in the treatment of stricture, it is evident that they must be employed so as to produce merely such a degree of irritation as is sufficient for giving rise to ab- soi-ption, since more than this might be apt to occasion intersti- tial effusion instead of absorption, and aggravate the stricture instead of relieving it. The bougies, therefore, should not be introduced too frequently, or too forcibly, or for too long a time ; and their use should not be persisted in when the parts or sys- tem are particularly irritable. Metallic bougies are best calcu- lated for the purpose, being the most smooth and easily guided. They may be made solid of steel and hollow of silver, or of the compound metal named Berlin silver, which I have found to answer very well for the purpose, being sufficiently rigid, taking a fine polish, and not being liable to rust. They should be gently paesed down to the obstructed part, in a series of gradually de- creasing sizes, until one can be introduced into the bladder, after which it ought to be immediately withdrawn. In the course of two or three days, when all the irritation that has thus been excited seems to have subsided, the same instrument may again be introduced ; and after it is withdrawn, another of somewhat larger size. By proceeding in this way, the cure, in moderately favourable circumstances, may be completed within from three to six weeks. The grand error to be avoided is that of proceed- ing too hastily, which not only defeats the practitioner in attain- ing the object he has in view, but exposes the patient to the danger of hemorrhage, complete retention of urine, swelled tcS' tide, feverish attacks resembling ague, and other unpleasantrRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 388 consequences. The urethra should always be dilated to its full size, as a relapse is otherwise apt to happen ; but any further extension than this can do no good. There are two forms of stricture in which the bougie has been found inadequate to afford relief. In one of these the canal, especially at the seat of contraction, is so extremely irri- table that even the most gentle use of instruments gives rise to violent and dangerous disturbance of the system, with rigors followed by fever, and frequently local inflammation. The patient, exhausted by such efforts, dreads their repetition ; and successive practitioners, finding that their most careful efforts lead only to the same results, any further attempts to afford relief are at length deemed inexpedient, and the disease is allowed to pursue its course, until a fatal retention of urine, or some equally fatal operation, undertaken to prevent extravasa- tion, terminates the complicated sufferings of such a case. In the other form of stricture which resists the ordinary means of treatment, there is an extreme degree of resiliency and tendency to contract after dilatation, so that only the most evanescent relief can be obtained through the means employed for this pur- pose. It may be added, that in both of these obstinate forms, the s}mptoms of the disease are, in general, peculiarly distress- ing, the urine being not only expelled with great difficulty by drops, or the smallest of thread-like streams, but also very im- perfectly retained, dribbling away involuntarily by day as well as night, and causing the utmost discomfort, by its effects on the patient's clothes and skin, exposed to the acrid moisture. In 1844, 1 felt great pleasure in communicating to the pro- fession a mode of remedy, which had afforded complete and per- manent relief in a case of obstinate stricture, than which it was impossible to imagine one more distressing or more hopeless, under any other known means of treatment. In 1849, en- couraged by further experience, I published a treatise on the treatment of stricture, with the view of explaining and recom- mending this method, and since that time have related a great many additional cases illustrative of its effects. For more parti-PELVIS. 389 ciilar details I may refer to these sources of inforroation, it being sufl&cient at present to render the principles of practice distinctly- intelligible. It is well known that there are certain textures, healthy as well as morbid, which cannot be expanded without pain and the risk of inflammation, but may be divided by incision with ease and safety. Spasmodic stricture of the anus, and the ring at the base of the prostate, which cannot be torn without the produc- tion of fatal effects, afford examples of this kind, and illustrate the advantage of cutting, under certain circumstances, instead of dilatation. In strictures of the urethra which exhibit the irri- table and rmyielding or resilient characters, it therefore seems reasonable to expect advantage from dividing them freely by means of a cutting instrument, instead of j)ersevering in vain and hazardous efforts to dilate the contracted part by bougies. At- tempts to accomplish this, 'by introducing sheathed blades into the canal, and also by cutting from without upon the point of an instrument carried down to the seat of obstruction, had been frequently made with a different view, viz., overcoming resist- ance, which was supposed to render the canal impermeable, but with very unsatisfactory results, from imperfect attainment of the object, extravasation of urine, and hemorrhage caused through the want of a safe guide for the knife. In the operation which I proposed, the first and essential step was to introduce a grooved director fairly through the stricture, so that complete division of the whole thickened texture might be effected with certainty, and with security from any lateral aberration, endangering the artery of the bulb or other arterial branches, the mesial plane of the perineum, which corresponds with the raphe, being free from vessels of the slightest consequence. But if stricture were frequently impermeable, this method must have been limited in its employment, and incapable of affording rehef in those cases which chiefly required it; and, therefore, so long back as 1844,1 expressed my persuasion that no stricture was truly impermeable, the exit of water being a certain sign that instruments might, through sufficient care, bePEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 390 introduced. This principle of practice was obviously of great importance, since conviction of its truth would obviously lead to much more prolonged and careful exploration of the passage than would be thought requisite, if belief in the existence of impermea- bility were entertained. JFor my own part, it was frankly con- fessed that, while sharing in the doctrine of impervious urethras, I had occasionally found them so, and performed the old opera- tion, while ever since adopting the principle that every stricture might be permeated by instruments through time and care, I had not, either in public or private practice, met with one that proved incon-igibly obstinate. In performing the operation, the only instruments required are a short, straight, sharp-pointed bistoury, a grooved director, and a silver catheter. The patient, under the influence of chloro- form, ^^^iepl^sesj) being placed with his back upon a bed or table, and his limbs held up so as to expose the perineum con- veniently for the purpose in view, the operator introduces the director, confides it to an assistant, and makes an incision over the stricture about an inch and a quarter in length, exactly in the I} central line or raphe. This incision should at once extend ' ■ through the skin, subjacent cellular texture, and fascia, and be afterwards deepened if necessary, great care being taken to cut precisely in the same plane, and especially to avoid going aside be- yond the director. The operator, having felt the instrument dis- tinctly, takes it in his left hand, and guarding the knife on his right fore-finger, inserts its point into the groove, on the bladder side of the stricture. He then urges the blade through the tliickened and indurated urethra, which, from its touglmess and yielding disposition, is apt to elude the knife, and next, having withdrawn the director, passes the catheter into the bladder where it must be secured by proper tapes, and a bandage round the loins. The catheter may be removed on the fourth day. This operation, when properly performed, I believe to be perfectly safe, but is apt to produce serious effects through inattention to some aiDparently trivial circumstance. Thus if the catheter be allowed to escape from the bladder, and urine isPELVIS. 391 allowed to separate the recently united edges of the wound, Adolent constitutional disturbance is almost sure to foUow. Another mode of treatment, though I fear inadequate to sub- due this disease in its most obdurate form, may be employed on ordinary occasions with the effect of accomplishing success more quickly than through gradual dilatation. This is to rupture the condensed part by separating the branches of a suitable in- strument introduced into the bladder. Ingenious instruments for this purpose have been invented at different times, and of late by Mr. Holt, who has strongly advocated this course of treatment. When the disease is complicated with fistula in perineo, the same treatment proves sufficient, as the sinuses, together with the callosities or induration surrounding them, speedily disap- pear after the obstruction which gave rise to them is removed. The iacisions, excisions, and cauterizations which were formerly practised, are therefore both' unnecessary and improper. But if the stricture require division on its own account, the presence of a fistulous condition will of coitrse afford no objection to this pro- cedure. If the urethra is altogether obstructed anterior to the fis- tula, so that even the smallest instrument cannot be passed through it, the only remedy is to introduce a catheter as far as the canal permits, and then cut down upon its extremity from the fistula, so as to allow its passage into the bladder. A flexible catheter should then be introduced, and allowed to remain for three or four days, to prevent the recent solution of continuity from heal- ing by primary union ; but it ought not to be left longer than this, as its presence wou.ld occasion a degree of irritation un- favourable to the cure by granulating contraction. If the in- strument is introduced occasionally, with the interval of a day or two, it will prevent any chance of the canal becoming again obstmcted, and not interfere with the process of reparation. Retention of Urine f rom Blows on the Perineum. Blows on the perineum are apt to occasion difficulty or total obstraction of the urinary evacuation. In some cases there is no solution of continuity effected by the violence, no wound of thePIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. 39? integuments, or rupture of the parts witliin, but merely as it seems a temporary paralysis, or want of consent in the muscles concerned, in consequence of the contusion. At other times the urethra is torn, blood streams from the orifice of the penis, not a drop of rxrine can escape, and a tumour is formed under the integuments of the perineum opposite the injured part by blood and urine. The treatment of such injuries is obvious, and not difficult. If there is no evidence of the urethra being ruptured, it may be expected that rest, warm fomentations, and slightly stimulating injections thrown into the rectum, wiU. soon restore the healthy actions which have been disturbed ; and should circumstances require it, a catheter may be introduced with the same facility as usual, to relieve the bladder from distension. For some time after such injuries, a bougie should be passed occasionally to prevent contraction of the canal, which is apt to happen in con- sequence of the irritation caused by the blow. But if, from the discharge of blood, the tension of the peiineum, and the impos- sibility which is experienced in attempting to introduce a catheter, it is ascertained that the urethra has been ruptured, Tueans must be taken without delay to provide for the evacuation of the urine, which cannot be expected to take place naturally, and to prevent the fluid from passing extensively into the cellidar substance through the breach of the urethi-a, which would necessarily lead to the most disastrous consequences. The best mode of proceeding is to cut into the perineal tumour, and then, having brought the ruptured canal into view, to convey a flexible catheter into the bladder. It may be allowed to remain for a few days, as in the case of operating for obstructed urethra, and the subsequent treatment does not differ from that which is proper on such an occasion. Diseases of the Prostate Gland. The Prostate Gland is little subject to disease previous to the age of fifty-five or sLxty. It is then Liable to an enlargemelit, which in its nature most agrees with the simple vascular sar-PELVIS, 393 coma, and, though often named scirrhus, has none of the charac' ters of carcinomatous formations except an approach to their hardness. The tumour is dense and fibrous, possesses little sen- sibility, is not disposed to any morbid action except its own nutrition, and, though the cause of uneasiness by its pressure on the neighbouring parts, is hardly ever itself the seat of much pain. The gland seldom enlarges equally, generally exceeding in one of the lateral lobes, and not unfrequently sending a round process upwards, encroaching on the cavity of the bladder, im- mediately behind its neck. Sir E. Home accounted for this marked limitation of the growth to one part of the gland, by attributing it to the existence of a distinct middle lobe of the prostate ; but in a healthy state of the part it is dijB&cult to dis- cern any trace of such a structure. Whatever be the true ex- planation of the fact, it is an important one in several points of view. Enlargement of the prostate, whether partial or general, does not necessarily or usually diminish the width of the urethra, but alters the direction of the canal so as to impede more or less the passage of the urine. When the whole gland swells, the neck of the bladder is of course elevated in a proportional degree, and the course of the urethra consequently rendered not only longer but more curved than natural. If one of the lateral lobes is more enlarged than the other, it gives the canal a bend to' pne side, and if the tumour is confined to the upper surface of the gland, within the orifice of the bladder, though the urethra cannot suffer any change, the excretion of urine may be con- siderably impeded. The symptoms of enlarged prostate are—1. A feeling of weight and uneasiness in the lower part of the pelvis ; 2. Pain and difficulty in evacuating the bowels ; 3. Frequent and slow micturition ; 4. A copious discharge of mucus with the urine, at the bottom of which it remains separate, forming a glairy mass that adheres to the vessel when the water is poured out; 5. A fetid ammoniacal smell of the urine. These symptoms, though in general always distinguishable, are seldom very well marked, except when the uriuaiy organs suffer irritation from a394 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. local or constitutional cause. They tlien become gi-eatly aggra- vated, and constitute what is called a fit of the disease, during which the patient has an almost incessant desire to empty his bladder, experiences extreme pain in attempting to do so, and sometimes labours under a complete retention of urine. Con- siderable information may usually be obtained as to the exist- ence and degree of the enlargement, by examining the gland with the finger in the rectum, after a catheter or bougie has been introduced into the bladder. Unless this precaution be taken, the prostate is very apt to be thought enlarged when it is not altered in size. The cause of the disease, as might be expected, seems to be excitement of the gland, either directly or through sympathy with the neighbouring parts; and it is accordingly observed chiefly in those who indulge in venereal excesses, who use a luxurious diet, or who are exposed to the stimulating influence of a warm climate. It occurs much more frequently in persons whose circumstances expose them to the evils of sedentary habits and redundant nourishment than in the labouring poor. The treatment of enlarged prostate obviously requires the prevention, so far as possible, of all circumstances tending to promote its increase. With this view the patient should live sparingly, scrupiilously avoiding all articles of food and drink which he linows from experience to have a stimulating effect on the organs connected with the gland, take proper exercise, and preserve the bowels in an easy state by means, if necessary, of gentle laxatives or injections of mild fluids into the rectum. During the paroxysms of the disease, rest in the horizontal pos- ture, the hip-bath, leeches applied to the perineum, small doses of laudanum, or solution of the muriate of morphia, with a few drops of balsam of copaiva, opiate injections into the rectum, and a diet restricted to little more than mucilaginous drinks, are the means which prove most effectual in affording relief. Should the flow of urine not only be rendered difficult, but be altogether impeded, it may become uecessaiy to introduce the catheter. The instrument selected sliould be of a medium size and ordinary395 PELVIS. form, managed so as to suit the direction which the canal takes in consequence of the elevation of the vesical extremity by the swelling of the prostate. When mnch difficulty has been ex- perienced in introducing the catheter, it should be allowed to remain in the bladder for a day or two. Various medicines have been employed to induce absorption of the tumour, as iodine and the muriate of Ume; but no real advantage has ever been de- rived from these means. It has also been proposed to cut out the enlarged prostate; but this proceeding is so inconsistent with the dictates of rational surgery, that the objections to it need not be taken into consideration. Earthy concretions are not unfrequently found in the ducts of the prostate. They are generally of a very small size, which only in rare cases equals that of a pea, of a rounded figure, and reddish-brown colour. Their composition is invariably phos- phate of lime, with a little animal matter. They usually exist in great numbers together; being either imbedded in the sub- stance of the gland, or collected into groups which occupy the dilated ducts. The symptoms which they occasion are not well ascertained, since their existence is seldom known until it is dis- covered afterjdeath by dissection. On several occasions, having cut into the membranous part of the urethra to remove a con- cretion that was felt there, I have found the prostate hollowed out into a cavity containing calculi, which were extracted with success. Extravasation of Urine, and Puncture of the Bladder. When retention of urine, from whatever cause it may proceed, is not remedied, the pressure occasioned by the confined iluid at length induces ulcerative absorption, and forms a breach which allows the urine to escape into the surrounding cellular substance. This rupture, as it is improperly termed, usually takes place im- mediately above the obstruction; and as most cases of complete retention depend on stricture at the bulb, the aperture generally occurs in the membranous part of the urethra. When the bladder gives way in such circumstances, it does so most fre-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 396 quently near the neck, where there is no covering of peritoneum. The urine no sooner begins to flow through the preternatural channel, than the patient experiences relief from the distress he previously suffered, and can hardly be persuaded that he is not ^making water in the ordinary way. The extravasated fluid may diffuse itself in all directions—upwards between the bladder and ! pubis, and laterally by the sides of the prostate, and downwards into the scrotum. The fascia, which lies under the integuments of the perineum, prevents the formation of any tumour in this situation ; but when the fluid gets through the less dense mem- brane opposite the scrotum, it speedily distends tlie loose cellular substance, and produces a large globular swelling. The urine, after being thus effused, soon excites great irritation, the effects of which are intense local inflammation, and constitutional dis- turbance of the most alarming character. The distended scrotum becomes first red, and before many hours black, while the system suffers as if influenced by some deadly poison; a quick small pulse, dark-coloured tongue, frequent vomiting, incessant hiccup, and low delirium, are the indications which betray this danger- ous condition; and death soon closes the scene unless some active means of relief are speedily and successfully administered. A free incision should be made in the perineum, through the fascia, and down to the infiltrated cellular substance. The scrotum may be scarified also, and hot fomentations ought to be applied to promote the discharge of putrid urine, blood, and sloughs ; while, at the same time, the patient's strength is dili- gently supported by wine and other cordials. If the njine has insinuated itself extensively into the cellular substance of the pelvis, all these means wUl be unavailing ; but if it has been chiefly confined to the scrotum and neighbourhood, a cure may be accomplished with careful management, and after a long con- finement. A surgeon should never hesitate to make free inci- sions in such cases, however desperate they may at first appear, since recoveries have taken place in ajjparently the most hopeless circumstances, when extensive slougldng was complicated with the weakness of old age.397 PELVIS. lu some raxe cases, the opening is formed into the rectum, and then the patient may escape the dangerous consequences of urinary effusion which have been described; but such an occur- rence is too rare to afford any reasonable ground for expecting relief from the unaided powers of the system, or withholding the means that effect evacuation more safely. These means consist in puncturing the bladder, so as to draw off its contents without allowing them to enter the cellular substance. If the surgeon possesses the requisite tact for introducing instruments into the bladder throixgh the urethra, and has the treatment of the case from its commencement, he will very rarely, perhaps never, be under the necessity of resorting to this pimcture. But should he not be able to draw off the water by the catheter, either from his own want of dexterity, or from the existence of obstacles caused by mismanagement, there can be no hesi- tation in having recourse to the operation. Puncture of the bladder, however performed, is always attended with more or less danger of urinous infiltration; but a doubtful remedy is better than none ; and there are few states of disease more hopeless than complete retention of urine, permitted to . follow its own course. There are three methods of puncturing the bladder—1, above the pubis; 2, by the perineum; 3, from the rectum. The opera- tion above the pubis is performed by making an incision an inch and a half long from the symphysis upwards, exactly in the mesial jjlaue, and then separating the edges of the recti, or rather pyramidal muscles, with the fingers and a little assistance from the knife, and lastly pushing a trocar into the distended bladder, which can now be distinctly felt. In order to avoid transfixing the neck, it is necessary to direct the instrument not perpendi- cularly, but obliquely backwards, from the point where it enters the cavity behind the pubis. The rigidity of a silver tube is apt to occasion injurious imtation, particularly as it must be long, and deeply introduced, to prevent any risk of its escape from the contraction of the coats of the bladder; but the canula must not be withdrawn without substituting some other channel398 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. for carrying away the urine, wMcli otherwise would be very apt to enter the cellular substance. A piece of flexible catheter answers very conveniently for the purpose, and the exchange should not be effected before the end of at least twenty-four hours. The patient should lie on his side, inclining forwards, to promote the discharge of urine ; and great care must be taken that the tube does not become obstructed by mucus, or in any other way. When the cellular substance surrounding the wound has become consolidated by adhesive effusion, as happens in a day or two, a plug may be fitted into the orifice of the can- ula, and withdrawn from time to time; but it generally hap- pens that the old passage is soon restored, after the bladder has been freed from the irritation of its accumulated contents. The bladder may be reached from the perineum by making a deep incision in the line extending from the bulb to the anus, and then pushing a straight bistoury, guided by a finger in the rectum, into the membranous part of the urethra. Puncturing from the rectum may have been suggested by the opening, which is sometimes formed naturally between it and the bladder, or prostatic portion of the urethra. In cases of complete retention, where the parts are not altered by disease, there can certainly be no easier or more satisfactory mode of re^ lieving the patient by operation. The bladder behind the pros- tate, for the extent of an inch or more, is not covered with peritoneum; and the vesiculcs seminales, though they meet together at the gland, diverge from each other in proceeding backwards, so as to leave sufficient space for the puncture. The vasa deferentia lie near the centre, and may perhaps be injured, even though the trocar is introduced exactly in the mesial plane; but any inconvenience that might be expected to result from this source ought not to be regarded as a serious objection to a proceeding which affords the only means of averting nearly certain death, especially as experience does not confirm the apprehension. When the operation is performed, the patient should be laid on his back at the edge of the bed, with his knees bent and thighs held up, so as to present the parts fairly to thePELVIS. 399 surgeon, who, having anointed the fore and middle fingers of his left hand, introduces them gently into the rectum until he feels the posterior confines of the prostate. The trocar, which should be six inches long and curved, is then carried in along the channel formed by the fingers, and when its point has passed beyond the prostate, the handle is depressed, so as to puncture the coats of the rectum and bladder where they are contiguous. The canula should be secured in its place for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, to .prevent the wound from closing before the obstruction that existed in the natural passage has been removed. Urinary Calculi. The bladder and other parts of the urinary passage frequently become the seat of concretions, which vary extremely in their number, size, and composition, but almost always occasion very distressing symptoms. The measures which have been devised for their prevention and removal consequently demand much attention; and, in order to understand them, it is necessary to be first acquainted with the origin and mode of formation of the different kinds of calculi. The urine in its healthy state holds a number of saline sub- stances in solution, which it deposits in part on cooling to the ordinary temperature. The quantity of this precipitate varies according to the degree in which the urine is diluted, being most observable after abstinence from drinking or profuse perspira- tion. It generally appears in the form of a light-coloured yellowish cloud, occupying the lower part of the vessel, or in that of a thin crust or lining, which adheres to its sides. When chemically examined, the lighl^coloured muddy-looking sedi- ment is found to consist of alkahne and earthy salts, which are chiefly the phosphate of lime, and the triple phosphate of mag- nesia and ammonia—the lateritious or crusted deposit, on the contrary, consisting of uric acid, or urate of ammonia with an excess of acid. In consequence of a variety of circumstances which will be more particularly considered hereafter, the urine becomes loaded with these matters in quantities, proportions, andPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 400 combinations, that give rise to concretions of various kinds. It appears tliat the fluid is sometimes secreted so overburdened with its acid or saline constituents as to deposit them imme- diately on escaping into the pelvis of the kidney, and form con- cretions, consisting by far most frequently of uric acid, but sometimes of the oxalate of lime. If the urine is not so loaded as to free itself immediately after being secreted, it does not afford any deposit so long as it is kept "within the body and maintained at its temperature; but when it is excreted and cooled down to the temperature of the air, it deposits all the redundant portion in the form of a copious muddy yellowish- white precipitate, containing the earthy salts—a lateritious crust, consisting of the acids and acidulous combinations of ammonia. If, however, while such an excess of the urinary constituents exists, a foreign body should be present in the bladder or in any other part of the passage through which the urine flows, so as to serve as a nucleus for concretion, it will, on the well-known principle observed to regulate the separation of salts from their solvents, whether in a crystallised form or not, induce the re- dundant matters to withdraw themselves from the attraction 6f the fluid, and adhere to the surface which is presented to them. This effect, however, can occur only where there is a considerable excess of saline substance, since, when the portion is small, it is retained in solution by the urine, at the high temperature which it has in the bladder, too powerfully to permit its precipitation by the influence of a foreign body. Urinary calculi which have attaiued any considerable size are hence found to consist of con- centric layers, varying in composition and thickness, according to the nature and quantity of the morbid excess that existed in the urine at the time of their formation; and, for the same reason, the rapidity with which they increase in size always bears a direct proportion to the derangement of the urinary secretion. The circumstances which tend to occasion excess in the acid and saline constituents of the urine are chiefly the following :— 1. Imperfect digestion, attended with acidity of stomach; in which case the urine has a deep brownish-red colour, and401 PELVIS. deposits either crystallised grains of uric acid that have separated from the iiuid in the kidney, or a red lateritious sediment on cooling. 2. An irritated state of the kidneys, attended with pain of the loins, quickness of the pulse, and anxiety of the coun- tenance ; in which case the urine is copious, pale-coloured, and deposits such a quantity of the phosphates on cooling as to become turbid and white like milk. 3. A similar state of irri- tation, chiefly affecting the bladder, and attended with a copious secretion of mucus; in which case the urine has a very dis- agreeable ammoniacal odour, and deposits the triple phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, either crystallised or amorphous. The condition of the urine during the deposition of oxalate of lime, and some animal substances that wiU be mentioned hereafter, has not yet been well ascertained. From an attentive consideration of these circumstances, it appears that the presence 'of a calculus may promote the for- mation of concretions from the urine—1. By affording a nucleus; 2. By irritating the bladder, increasing the quantity of mucus, and accelerating the putrefactive decomposition of the urine, during which the urea is converted into ammonia, and an excess of the triple phosphate results ; 3. By causing sympathetic irri- tation of the kidneys, which perverts their secreting action, and leads to the formation of the earthy salts in redundant quantity; 4. By sympathetically irritating the stomach, and occasioning imperfect digestion, attended with acidity. By operating in one or more of these modes, the nucleus, when once formed, always increases, and even tends to cause the generation of new ones. The nucleus, unless when consisting of a foreign body introduced into the bladder, is almost invariably constituted by a concretion formed in the kidney. This renal calculus, in the great majority of cases, as has been already observed, is an aggregation of uric acid grains, but may also consist of oxalate of lime. It is often observed by patients, that previously to suffering from the symptoms of calculus, they were accustomed to pass red grains of uric acid—sand or gravel as they are usually called—and that they ceased to do so for some time before the commencement of 2 D402 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGEKY. their complaint. It is extremely diflficult to account for the origin of these concretions, farther than has been already done, though there are doubtless some important causes in operation, which liitherto have not been ascertained. Calculous diseases are much more common in same districts of country than others, and all that we know in regard to the difference of these is, that where the strongest predisposition has been observed, the mineral strata of the neighbourhood were of a calcareous nature. The . formation of renal nuclei takes place most frequently ■ before puberty, and after the age of fifty; but no time of life is alto- gether exempt from it. There is no temperament or variety of original constitution that seems particularly favourable to the occurrence of the disease, but there is occasionally observed some evidence of the predisposition being hereditary. Gout and stone are often connected, but they probably are so from owing their oiigin to the same source, viz., derangement of the digestive organs. The symptoms of a calculus in the kidney are an almost iconstant feeling of uneasiness in the loins, aggravated by rou^h motion, and soothed by rest; the discharge of small fibrinous clots with the lirine after fits of irritation, and during their con- tinuance, tenderness of the loins, nausea or vomiting, and frequent desire to make water, which is sometimes attended with pain at the point of the penis. If, while there are such symptoms, the bladder should be examined, and found to contain, no calculus, ; there will be strong ground of suspicion that one exists in the ; kidney; but there can hardly be any certainty acquired on the I subject, as different morbid states, not only of the kidney, but f also of other parts of the urinary apparatus, produce nearly, if not altogether, the same indications. The object of treatment in this case is to promote the descent of the calculus into the bladder, with which view the patient should take exercise, and drink largely of diluent fluids. Advan- tage seems sometimes derived from conjoining the latter with a small quantity of spirits, such as Hollands, or with the tincture of cantharides; but caution must be observed in doing so, lestPELVIS. 403 too much excitement be occasioned. The calculus, if it remain in the pelvis of the kidney, does not increase rapidly in size, as the urine, from passing away through the ureter immediately after being secreted, has little time to deposit the excess of solid matters which it may contain. Sometimes, however, the con- cretion of uric acid enlarges so as to occiipy the whole pelvis and infundibula, branching out like a piece of coral, or becomes incnisted with the triple phosphate. Much more freqi;ently the calculus remains of a small size, ranging from that of a pea to that of a field bean, of an oval figure, very similar to the stone of an olive, and smooth reddish-brown surface, in which the com- ponent grains may in general be distinguished. In some rare cases abscesses have been produced by the irritation of the kidney, and in others still more rare, the matter, by inducing absorption of the parietes of the abdomen, has made a passage outwards for the stone. Exaggerated reports of such occurrences have given rise to stories of renal calculi having been cut out, and ISTephrotomy has been seriously proposed by surgeons who think more of the execution than the consequences of opera- tions. "When the calculus descends into the ureter, unless of very- small size, it occasions great local pain, and sympathetic irritation of the abdominal viscera. The patient complains of intense pain •in the inguinal region of the affected side, about midway between the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium and the ^Dubis, which is greatly aggravated by pressure or motion. There is incessant nausea, and frequent bilious retching. The stream of urine pressing behind the calculus, and widening the passage, while it forces the obstructed body forwards, at length conveys it into the bladder, immediately upon which all the uneasiness is at once removed. This process of descent, which usually occu- pies from twelve to forty-ciglit hours, may be expedited and rendered less painful by administering from time to time doses of castor-oil, with the muriate of morphia, or other preparations of opium—by throwing opiate injections into the rectum—by placing the patient in a warm bath—and by bleeding from tlie404 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGEllY. arm, if he is of a robust habit. Sooner or later the passage is completed, and there are few preparations more rarely met with in museums than those shewing a renal calculus areested in the ureter. Having arrived in the bladder, the calculi either remain there, or proceed onwards through the urethra. In the former case, they become encrusted with layers of various thickness and com- position, as has been already explained, and constitute concre- tions which differ widely, according to the circumstances that attend their formation. The following arrangement includes the most important kinds :— I Name. Uric Acid Cal- ciilus. (Sclieele, 1776.) External Cliaracters.

Pain felt in making water, especially when the la^t drops ^ are exited, and/*H» for some time afterwards, refeiTed chieiiy to the point of the -i^i^" penis, bnt also to more distant parts, as the inner side of the thighs, testicles, x^articnlarly the left one, and even the feet. 2. Uneasy feelings of a similar kind, but not so intense, experi- enced upon any sudden motion of the body. 3. Frequent de- sire to make water, varying in degree from slight dimiuution of the length of the intervals, to almost incessant calls, which it is impossible to resist. 4. The urine being tinged with blood after rough motion. 6. An occasional interruption of the stream of urine. 6. A peculiar expression of suffering and anxiety in the patient's countenance. These symptoms vary extremely in their positive and relative severity, being always most intense when there is irritation of the bladder or general system, and bearing a direct proportion to the degree in which the urinary secretion is deranged ;—a fact not easily explained, but very important in respect to the treatment of the disease. Thus, contrary to what might be expected, the least annoyance attends the mulberry calculus. The uric acid kind -are accompanied with more, and the phosphates with most of all. As there are other diseased states of the urinary organs which give rise to comj^laints more or less similar to stone in the bladder, it is necessary for obtain- ing certain proof of its existence to introduce an instrument into the bladder, and search it. The operation performed with thisPKINCIPLES OF BUKGERY. 406 view is named Sounding, and is executed by means of metallic instruments variously formed. The one tliat will generally be found most convenient is a steel bougie of the size usually rated No. 7 or 8. It should be moved about methodically into eveiy part of the bladder, while the patient lies reclining. If the point grazes against the rugse of a thickened muscular coat, an inexpe- rienced surgeon may be misled into supposing that there is a stone; but if it really encounters one, there will hardly be a possibility of misinterpreting the distinct sensation which is always felt, and the corresponding sound generally heard at the same time. A small stone may escape detection, from the bladder being too much distended or. too much collapsed; and when either of these sources of fallacy is suspected, a catheter should be introduced to draw off the water, or convey in a suffi- cient quantity from a syringe or elastic bag. If the parts about the neck of the bladder are very irritable, and grasp the sound- ing instrument tightly, soothing measures, such as gentle evacua- tion of the bowels by castor-oil, opiate injections into the rectum, and the warm-bath, ought to be employed. When the prostate ;has suffered enlargement, a sort of pouch is generally formed behind it, in which the stone may Lie so as to be hardly tangible by the sound, unless placed more within its reach, by altering the position of the patient, or elevating the bladder by a finger introduced into the rectum. The treatment of stone in the bladder may be ^divided into palliative and radical. The former consists in the use of means which tend to prevent the concretion from increasing, and to alleviate the patient's sufferings; the latter, by removing tlae calculus, affords effectual relief from all the uneasiness of the disease. The means used with a palliative \dew are such as may be expected to correct derangement of the urinary secretion, and thus not only remove that excess of acid, or saline constituents, which is essential for the occurrence of concretion, but also diminish the severity of the symptoms resulting from the cal- culus actually existing, since these, as has been already observed,PELVIS. 407 always con-espond directly in their severity with the degree to wliich the secretion of nrine is morbidly altered. In order to determine what remedies ought to be prescribed for this purpose, the urine of the patient must be examined. If it shews the cha- racters which denote an excess of acid, alkaline medicines will be indicated. Of these the carbonates of soda and potash are the best, and may be administered in the dose of a scruple or half a drachm, two or three times a day, dissolved in a tumbler of water. Lime-water and soap-ley were formerly much used in various forms and combinations, in the expectation of their pro- ducing a solvent effect on the stone ; and the relief experienced from them was often so great as to afford apparently good ground for believing that they possessed such a power. It is admitted now that they could act beneficially only by correcting morbid derangements of the urinary secretion ; and they are, therefore, sxiperseded by the less nauseous all?;aline preparations above mentioned. If, on the contrary, the quantity of earthy and alka-\ line salts seems to be redundant, acids should be employed. The muriatic is usually preferred, and may be given in the dose of twenty or thiiiy drops, in a sufficient quantity of water, three times a day. When, along with this state of the urine, there exists much irritation about the bladder and kidneys, as is gene- ] rally the case, small doses of opium ought to be conjoined with [ ■ the acid; and other means of a soothing kind, as the hip-bath j and opiate injections, at the same time prescribed. Whatever be/ the nature of the derangement, it will always be proper to correct any errors in the patient's diet or mode of living that tend to injuri the health in general, and the digestive functions in particular. 1 The means which are employed with the view of effecting a radical cure, may be considered under three heads, accordingly as they act:—1. By promoting the escape.of the stone entire through the natural passage ; 2. By breaking down the stone into fragments small enough for being carried out with the stream of urine; and, 3. By cutting a free outlet for the stone. Eenal calculi of smaU size generally remain only a short time in the bladder, and pass out with the urine often almost imnie-408 PEINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. diately after descending from tlie ureter. When tlie history of a case leads to the suspicion of there being a concretion of tliis kiad remaining ia the bladder, or if it should be detected by sounding, its exit ought to be assisted by a very complete dila- tation of the urethra by means of bougies, by drinking copiously of simple diluent fluids, and by the relaxing influence of warm bathiug. Cases sometimes occur in which the calculus has entered into the urethra, and after passmg through more or less of its extent, has been arrested at a narrow part of the canal either natural, or resulting from stricture. The membranous portion is the most common seat of this occurrence, which also happens sometimes at the orifice. A retention of urine occasion- ally results from the obstruction thus caused; and if a full-sized catheter were passed without any precau.tion, it might push the concretion back into the bladder, which of course ought to be avoided. The instrument should be merely carried down so far as to disengage the calculus from the contracted place that it occupies, and which it closes like a spherical valve ; or, if of a very small size, it may be conveyed past the concretion -into the bladder. The immediate bad effects being thus obviated, it is necessary to employ means for assisting the stone to pass for- wards. Bougies of progressively increasing size, introduced down to the seat of obstruction, may prove sufficient for this purpose. Forceps are used with hardly any advantage, from the difficulty of expanding their blades. "When it proves impos- sible to extract the calculus from the urethra, it ought to be cut out, which is readily effected, by making an incision upon it whUe held firmly, so as to prevent any displacement during the operation, or upon a grooved staff. The wound sometimes heals by the first intention, but it is prudent to keep a catheter in the urethra for a few days, to prevent any risk of the urine infiltrat- ing into the cellular substance. Calculi are sometimes lodged in fistulas of the perineum, and, of course, so long as they are permitted to remain, render a cure by the ordinary means im- practicable. If discovered in this situation, they should be removed without delay by incision.PELVIS. 409 Tlie second mode of removing a stone from the bladder con- sists in grinding it down to powder, or piects small enough for escaping by the natural passage. Though there are very ancient traces of this practice, and though in modern times ingenious patients have occasionally, by persevering efforts, succeeded in bringing away part, if not the whole, of calculi from which they suffered, yet Lithotrity, as this method of operating has been named, may be regarded as of recent origin. The apparatus was necessarily very inefficient and unmanageable so long as the canula through which it was introduced into the bladder had a curved form. Some anatomists of the last century suggested that a straight instrument might be passed along the urethra; but Dr. Gruithuisen (1813) first used a straight catheter. The contrivance of this gentleman, followed by the successive im- provements of Amussat, Leroy, Civiale, and Heurteloup, rendered the lithotritic apparatus woxiderfully perfect. It consisted of a straight canula, containing another of steel, the extremity of which was cleft into three branches, that expanded by their own elasticity when pushed beyond the external tube, and closed upon being drawn ^vithin it. This internal canula in its turn enclosed a solid rod of steel, terminating in a head so figured as to act destructively on a stone submitted to its rotatory motion. At the other extremity of this apparatus there were additional parts for preventing the escape of the urine, without impeding the motion of the canulas or perforator, and for attaching the string of a drill bow. When the stone was large, a compound perforator could be employed, having a movable branch at its extremity, that might be separated to more or less distance from the central position by a regulating screw at the other end, and excavate the stone to an extent corresponding with the degree of its expansion. The thin shell thus formed was broken by an- other instrument, named hriscrcoqiie, which consisted of an instru- ment shaped like a slightly curved Sound, and having its ex- tremity formed into strong jaws, which were made to separate and embrace the stone, which was then crushed by the blows of a hammer or the force of a screw. The latter apparatus hasPBINCIPLES OF SUKGEKY. 410 come to supersede the former one for the whole operation, whicli is, therefore, now named Lithotripsy or crushing, to distinguish it from the grinding process. It is needless to describe par- ticularly the various instruments employed, since description alone could give no precise idea of theii- structure, and stOl less of their exercise. The general principle, as already mentioned, consists in the separation of two jaws by pushing one before the other, and then, after grasping the stone, approximating them by the force of a screw or simply manual pressure. Great improvements have been made in the instruments em- ployed for crushing stones^ in the bladder, attended with a corre- sponding degree of facility and success in their employment. The operation may now be conducted with propriety by any practitioner who is accustomed to mam'pulate the urethra and bladder ; and when the stone is not so large as to require fre- quent repetition of the process, it may be removed in tliis way with wonderfully little disturbance to the patient. But if there is any prospect of a prolonged and laborious conflict with the fragments, it is much better to extract the concretion entire through incision, than to incur the danger of exciting chronic inflammation of the bladder. Chronic inflammation of the prostate gland or mucous mem- brane, if excited by the pressure or laceration of the instrument, will probably lead to further derangement of the urinary secre- tion, and the consequent deposition of new calciili,—the irrita- tion caused in extracting which will keep up the traiu of morbid action, and if not at length fatal to the patient, must at aU events make him suffer much more than he would have done from excision of the stone. x When the operation is to be performed, the patient should be placed reclining, with his pelvis a little elevated. The crushing instruments must not be introduced when the bladder is empty, as its coats could then hardly escape injury; but it is not expe- dient to inject water for the purpose of distension, as it is apt to escape by exciting the contractile effort of expulsion. A better plan is to allow accumulation of the urine to the requisite extent,411 PELVIS. since there is then less tendency to evacuation, while the capa- city of retention affords the best evidence of the organ being sufficiently free from irritability to warrant the operation. Chlo- roform should not be administered, since pain is a sure sign of I some error in the procedure, and therefore if prevented from/ being manifested, can no longer act as a useful beacon to the ^ operator. The patient should be placed on his back, with the pelvis raised by a firm pillow, so as to let the stone lie, not at the neck, but in the posterior fundus of the bladder. In search- ing for the concretion or its fragments, the instrument should not be moved about at random with expanded jaws, but be carefully conveyed to the side of the body which it is desired to seize, and then, ha\dng one blade elevated, while the other remains in its place, be fauiy turned round and closed upon the stone. It is impossible to explain any more in this than other operations, all the minutiae of manipulation which are requisite for its suc- cessful performance. Practical experience, and familiarity with the instruments employed, are essential for a perfect execution of the process, which is one of those that may be performed with advantage on the dead subject. There is no operation of surgery which has excited so much attention, and been practised in so many different ways, as Litho- tomy. A prejudice, that it was unsafe to cut the neck of the bladder, for many centuries paralysed all exertions in improving the operation, which, in accordance with this misleading prin- cix-)le, was performed by making an incision in the perineum, and then nominally dUating, but really tearing, the orifice of the bladder sufficiently to allow the stone to be extracted. Such a procedure being tedious, pamful, and dangerous, was justly dreaded both by patients and surgeons, the latter of whom wil- lingly resigned it to irregular practitioners of rupture curuig, and cutting for the stone, who in those days travelled the countiy in search of employment. The mode of performing lithotomy was indeed taught in the schools, and ingenious men contrived various modifications of the apparatus; but no real improvement was effected until near the end of the seventeenth century, when412 PEINCIPLE3 OF SUEGERY. Frfere Jacques introduced an entirely different method, wliich was to cut freely into the bladder. He commenced his career as a lithotomist, unacquainted with anatomy, and provided with very imperfect instruments,—but nevertheless extracted the stone with such invariable facility and dispatch, that though many of his pa- tients died, and comparatively very few made complete recoveries, he acquired great reputation, and the friendship of some of the most distinguished surgeons in Paris. Through their assistance he supplied the defects of his education, and afterwards operated in various countries with distinguished success. The important truth having thus been ascertained, that the bladder could be cut without any fatal or injurious consequences, the attention of surgeons took a different direction, and a variety of methods and instruments were contrived for cutting the same parts that had been previously torn. It is unnecessary to consider these parti- cularly, as the operation practised and described by Cheselden (1720), though perhaps not differing materially from that of some other surgeons both in this country and abroad, has been gene- rally regarded the standard for imitation. The lateral operation of Cheselden consists in making a free incision of the perineum,—opening the urethra at its membranous part, and continuing the cut through the prostate gland, obliquely outwards and downwards. The simplest mode of effecting this is to use a scalpel, or other knife, that may be under the sur- geon's command; but as it requires an accurate acquaintance with the relative situation of the parts concerned, and consider- able manual dexterity, to divide the prostate safely with such an instrument, various apparatus have been contrived for cutting in the requisite direction, and to a sufficient extent, merely in con- sequence of their form and construction, and without the neces- sity of precise guidance on the part of the sxu'geon. But after a hundred years' experience of such substitutes for operative skiU, it is now almost universally admitted that the simple laufe is by far the safest means for the purpose, and it does not seem neces- sary to enter here into any description of the obsolete procedures which used to occupy so large a portion of systematic surgical413 PELVIS. writings. The instruments required are—1. A grooved staff to guide the knife in cutting into the bladder. It ought to be of the largest size that the urethra will readily admit, which is usually about No. II of the bougie scale, and the groove should be very wide and deep, neither on the side nor convex surface, but in the intermediate space, so as to correspond with the direc- tion in which the incision is carried. ^ Mr. Aston Key recom- mended a straight staff,—which certainly has the eidvantage of conveying the knife more directly than a curved one, but is liable to the objections of occupying the ojjerator's left hand while the section is made, instead of leaving it at liberty to press aside the rectum, and also of exposing the artery of the bulb to danger. 2. A knife, which, including both the handle and blade, should be between seven and eight inches in length. The edge of the blade should be blunt, except to the distance of an inch and a quarter from the point. 8. Forceps for extracting the stone, of two or three different sizes, of which the blades should be broad, moderately hollowed, and destitute of projecting teeth, which are apt to break the calculus. 4. A scoop to remove frag- ments or gravel. And, 5. A flexible tube, about six inches long, and half an inch wide, to convey away the urine after the opera- tion, and prevent its infiltration into the cellular substance. The parts that require to be cut are:—I. The integuments,' which should be divided to the extent of about three inches in an adult, or more if the subcutaneous adipose tissue is unusually thick, and of course less in children. The incision should extend obliquely from the raphe of the perineum to the hip, passing nearly equidistant between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium. 2. The transverse muscle of the perineum, and inte- rior part of the levator ani. 3. The transverse artery of the peri- neum. 4. The membranous part of the urethra. 5. The prostate gland through the whole extent of its left lateral lobe. And the parts which ought not to be cut are:—I. The rectum, which may be injured in laying open the perineum, in cutting into the groove of the staff, and in dividing the prostate, but chiefly in enlarging the wound, in case it proves too small subsequently to withdraw-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 414 ing the staff. 2. The artery of the bulb of the urethra, and the bulb itself, from cutting into the canal too far forwards, and at its lateral part. 3. The pudic ai-tery, from cutting too much in a lateral direction in making the section of the prostate. 4. The internal fascia of the perineum, or vesical reflexion of the pelvic fascia, from cutting the prostate upwards, or carrying the incision beyond it in a lateral direction. Wlien the operation is to be performed, the patient should have his bowels freely evacuated by a laxative administered the day before. He should be placed reclining on a table about two feet and a half high, covered with a folded blanket, and under his head a pillow or two may be laid, but nothing to raise tlie shoulders. He is then to seize the soles of his feet, one in each hand, which should rest on the fibular or outer edge, and by \ means of a strong tape or bandage have the limbs secured in this position, after which they are to be confided to two assistants, one standing on each side of the table. The staff having been introduced is now to be committed to a third assistant, who holds it in one hand, and the scrotum in the other. The surgeon then •seats himself on a chair, shaves off the hair from the perineum, ■feels the different parts that determine the place of his incision, and resting the fingers of his left hand on the skin so as to pre- ■ vent any displacement of it, pushes his knife directly inwards at the anterior point of incision to the depth of the perineal muscles. He cuts in the direction above mentioned so as to divide the skin, fat, superficial fascia, and transverse muscle, gradually diminish- ing the depth of his incision until it reaches its posterior termin- ation; then introducing the fingers of the left hand into the wound, to serve as a guide for the laiife and protection to the '•■ rectum, he cuts so as to divide the anterior part of the levator ani, and expose the membranous portion of the urethra, into which he makes an opening, and then, keeping the knife in the gi-oove, while he satisfies himself, by taking the staff in his left hand, that it is held properly in the mesial plane close up against the pubis, he gives it again to the assistant, and pushes the knife steadil}' into the bladder, and fairly through the prostate ; at the samePELVIS. 415 time, ynth. his left hand, holding down the rectum, and feeling what way is made with the knife. He then introduces his finger into the bladder, desires the staff to be withdrawn, and conducts in the forceps. He searches for the stone with the blades closed, and having found it, opens them very wide, depresses, and then closes them. By gently relaxing his hold, and renewing it, he shifts the position of the calculus, if unfavourable for extraction, and, with the assistance of his left fore-finger, proceeds to draw out the stone, not directly, but by a motion in alternate direc- tions, so as to dilate the margin of the wound without tearing. Forcible efforts ought never to be used in doing this ; and it is much better to introduce the knife again, if the opening proves too small. After one stone has been removed, the bladder ought to be searched for more, with a sound introduced through the wound ; and if any are detected, they must be removed in the same way as the first. Should the calculus be broken, its frag- ments must be carefully extracted with the scoop if small, or the forceps if large. The tube is then to be introduced, either alone, or, if there is much tendency to hemorrhage, with some folds of lint wrapped round its middle.; after which the patient may be placed in bed, on his right side, with the limbs moder- ately bent. The after treatment in cases that proceed favourably is ex- i tremely simple. Means must be employed to prevent the urine ' which distils through the tube fi-om wetting the bed, by interpos- ing a piece of oHed cloth between it and a folded blanket laid under the breech. The diet, during the first three or four days, should be sparing, and of a farinaceous kind. Gentle laxatives, such as castor-oil, are to be administered as occasion may require. The tube may be withdrawn at the end of either two or three days. | About the ninth day a little mine is generally observed to issue [ from the urethra; and when the natural passage thus begins to ■ be resumed, the discharge by the wound very soon ceases, so that ^ by the thirteenth or fifteenth day the whole is evacuated by the I penis. The bad consequences of the operation are:—1. Sinking ;PIUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. 41G 2. Hemorrhage ; 3. Infiltration of urine ; 4. Inflammation at tlu; neck of the bladder ; 5. Peritonitis ; 6. Eecto-vesical fistula. Unless the patient is extremely weak from the exhaustion of disease, or the feebleness of his age, as when it is below two, or beyond seventy years, there is no risk of his sinking directly under the effects of the irritation attending the operation, if pro- perly performed. But if, from the inadequate size of the wound in the bladder or levator ani, the stone, instead of being gently extricated, is dragged out by force, after long and painful ineffec- tual attempts to draw it through, the stoutest individual may suffer a shock too great for liis strength, and die in the course of a few hours, as if suffering from profuse hemorrhage, an extensive burn, or any other injury destructive to the powers of life. If the vessels are regularly distributed, and the surgeon cuts no more than he ought to do, there is hardly any fear of a fatal or even troublesome bleeding. Should the dorsal artery of the penis rise from the pudic high in the pelvis, and take the course which it has been obsei'ved to follow in some few cases along the neck of the bladder, and obHquely across tlie lateral lobe of the prostate, it can hardly escape division during the perform- ance of the operation Avhich has been described. The coincid- ence of such an irregularity with stone in the bladder must be extremely rare; and the danger of hemorrhage from this source so small as to afford little reason for apprehension, though instances of it have occurred. When the flow of blood appears alarming, the surgeon should introduce his finger into the wound, and press the pudic against the ramus of the ischium. He will then ascei-tain whether the hemorrhage proceeds from it or its branches given off below, in either of which cases a ligature may be applied by means of a tenaculum, the sides of the wound being held aside, and the source of the bleeding, if necessary, exposed to view more completely by further iaicisious. If the hemorrhage is found to proceed, not from the trunk of the pudic, the artery of the bulb, or that of the perineum, it must be referred to the neighbourhood of the prostate, and all417 PELVIS. that can be done is to iutroduce a tube wrapped in lint, raise the patient's breech, and apply cold. Infiltration of urine takes place when, from the small size of the wound, from its being seated too far forward in the peri- neum, from an insufficient division of the levator ani, or from swelling of the cut surfaces, the urine has not a free outlet ex- ternally; and if the incision of the bladder is carried far back, more especially through the reflection of the pelvic fascia on its neck, this imtoward event will be more apt to happen. The patient feels first a painful sense of distension, and then an un- easiness in the hypogastric region behind the pubis, which leads to the belief that peritonitis is commencing, and blood is freely withdrawn, both locally and generally, without affording any relief. A fever, attended with the symptoms that denote exces- sive irritation, commences, continues in despite of every means employed to check it, and proves fatal in a few days. When- ever the urine is not observed within five or six hours after the operation, the surgeon should examine the tube to discover whether or no it is obstructed by coagulated blood,—and if a tube has not been employed, he should introduce his finger into the bladder, so as to make sure of there being a free passage for the fluid, keeping in mind that infiltration of urine, though in general easily prevented, can seldom if ever be remedied. .Inflammation at the neck of the bladder is the bad conse- quence most to be dreaded. It is attended with pain at the point of the penis, nausea, with disgust at every sort of food, and occasional retching,—yellow furred tongue,—frequent pulse, —and great general restlessness. It proves fatal seldom sooner than one, or later than three weeks. On dissection, the ceUular substance at the neck of the bladder is found infiltrated with pus, and the prostate gland also contains purulent collections. The circumstances that seem to have most effect in givin" rise to this insidious and deadly process are laceration and contu- sion inflicted during the removal of the stone, especially if the sensitive and unyielding ring at the base of the prostate in the neck of the bladder be not divided by incision. This texture 2 EPRINCIPLES OF SUKGEKY. 418 resists division, and cannot be torn with impunity; so that the safety of the operation depends very much upon the point thus essential being dixly accomplished. Little can be done to an-est the inflammation when once excited,—but the means that pro- mise most assistance in doing so are frequent immersion of the pelvis in a hip-bath, and opiate injections. Peritonitis very seldom follows the lateral operation of litho- tomy ; but if it should occur, it will appear within twenty-four or forty-eight hours at furthest, and may be recognised by the tenderness of the abdomen to pressure, the small wiry pulse, and cadaverous appearance of the patient. Free depletion, both local and general, warm fomentations, and the warm bath, will be the proper remedies. A communication between the rectum and wound occasions, in the first instance, little inconvenience; but as the cure ad- vances, and the orifice of the wound contracts, the contents of the gut, whether gaseous or liquid, instead of escaping through it, are forced into the urethra, and issue from the penis, while part of the urine descends into the rectum. The only chance of remedy for this disagreeable occurrence is to divide the septum that Hes between the external orifice of the wound, and its communication with the gut; but this should not be done im- mediately after the operation, as it has . happened that the woimd of the intestine, when of small extent, occasioned no trouble, and healed by the first intention. "When the various obstacles to success that have been men- tioned, together with the adverse influence. of disease in the Iddney, which is sometimes associated with stone in the bladder, and also the dangerous consequences common to all severe operations, are taken into account, it will appear obvious, that, however perfect the principles on which the operation is performed, and skilful its execution, the patient's recovery can- not be regarded as by any means certain. A succession of for- tunate cases often leads an operator. to flatter himself with a belief of liis own infallibility, but sooner or later he meets with reverses; and it appears that the average of successful practicePELVIS. 419 is one death in from seven to ten cases. The period of life at which the operation proves most successful is between the second and fifteenth years, and next to this from sixty to seventy. The most unfavourable age seems to be about forty or fifty; and it is always observed that when the health is vigor- ous, and the suffering from the disease slight, the risk is much greater than when the patient is reduced by continued and incessant pain, provided no organic disease has been excited in any part of the system. Other methods of cutting for the stone have been proposed and followed more or less extensively; but as the success attend- ing any of them has not nearly approached that of the operation which has been fully considered, it seems unnecessary to enter into a particular detail of them, and the four following may be noticed shortly as the most deserving of attention:—1. The bilateral operation ; 2. The high operation, or above the pubis ; 3. The recto-vesical operation ; and, 4. The median. The first of these was contrived by M. Dupuytren, in order to lessen the risk of injuring the rectum and pudic artery. The peculiarity of it consists in cutting the prostate on both sides equally, which is effected by an instrument constructed for the purpose, and composed of a sheath containing two blades, that can be made to project laterally more or less as may be required. This instrument, being conveyed into the bladder on the groove of the staff, after the preliminary incisions have been made in the perineum, in a transverse direction, is expanded and with- di'awn in this state, cutting the gland to the requisite extent. Many objections might be urged against this method, but it is sufficient to mention that the result of experience is not in its favour. The High operation is of older date, having been intro- duced about the close of the seventeenth century, when it was discovered that the bladder could be cut with safety, but the proper principles for operating in the lateral way had not yet been established. It was proposed considerably earlier than this, and had even been practised in some few cases, but did not engage much attention until the time mentioned. The mode of420 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. procedure was to make an incision in the Mwea alba, about three inches long, extending from the pubis upwards, separate the recti muscles, and open the anterior or pubic side of the bladder, begiiming as near as possible to its neck, and continuing the wound upwards to a sufficient extent, with care to avoid cutting the peritoneum, where reflected on the fundus. The advantages contended for in recommendation of this operation were the facility of its performance, even where the stone was of the largest size, the safety of it in respect to hemorrhage, and the comparatively small degi'ee of pain it occasioned the patient. The objection, however, of urinous infiltration, which was equally obvious in theory and serious in practice, more than coimter- balanced these arguments; and the means contrived for preventing tliis dangerous consequence either proved insufficient, or, by their complexity and irritation, destroyed the great ground of supe- riority contended for. The high operation is now performed by very few surgeons, and will probably soon cease to be practised at all. The Eecto-vesical method was introduced by Vacca and Sanson (1816), and through the influence of their recommenda- tion, together with that of some other surgeons, attracted con- siderable attention for a few years. It consisted in dividing the sphincter ani, rectum, membranous part of the urethra, and prostate, so as to lay the two canals thus far into one, through which the stone could be easily extracted. This was effected by introducing into the bladder a staff grooved on its convex side, cutting through the sphincter and the integuments of the peri- neum, and then conveying in a sharp-pointed curved bistoiuy, which being entered into the groove beyond the prostate, and carried steadily forwards, completed the cutting part of the operation at once. It was contended that the stone could thus be got out very easily, and with hardly more pain than what attends the operation for fistula in ano—that there could be no danger of bleeding incurred—and that the risk of urinous infil- tration, as well as inflammation, would be less than after the lateral operation. The great objection that obviously suggested itself was the probability of a recto-vesical fistula; but the freePELVIS. 421 division of the sphincter seemed likely to diminish the chance of this, and experience proved that it did not often happen. In the hands of an inexpert operator, this method is perhaps the least difi&cult; but it certainly must be regarded as decidedly inferior to the lateral operation when properly performed, as well in regard to the danger of its immediate effects, as in prospect of the patient's condition after recovery being accomplished. When the stone is of no great size, it may be removed very easily and safely by what has been called the Median operation —^that is, opening the membranous part of the urethra, just as if for the division of a stricture, and then passing forceps with narrow blades into the bladder, a tube being afterwards placed in the wound to prevent urinary extravasation. Retention of Urine in Females. From the shortness, straight direction, and width of the urethra, together with the absence of a prostate gland, females are much less liable to retention of urine than males. They suffer from it, however, occasionally, in consequence of the follow- ing circumsta.nces :—1. Paralysis from distension; 2. The pres- sure of a gravid uterus; and, 3. Eetroversion of the uterus. The female bladder is more capacious than that of the male, and can suffer the accumulation of more fluid without being injured in its contractile power. When, however, the limit of healthy expansion is at length exceeded, the same effect is induced as when the male bladder is concerned, and the patient labours under a complete retention, which requires for her relief that the catheter should be introduced. The instrument employed for this purpose is made of silver, about six inches long, very slightly curved, and a quarter of an inch wide. The patient lies in bed on her back with the thighs drawn up ; and the operation ought to be performed imder the clothes. The fore-finger of the right or left hand, according to the position of the patient, is intro- duced between the labia minora, and carried upwards to their junction, a little below which the orifice of the urethra is situ- ated, and where it is readily recognised by the feeling of a de-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 422 pressiou, with a little elevation behind or nearer the vagina. The finger being retained here, the point of the catheter is by its means directed into the bladder. The mouth of the tube may be closed by applying the thumb over it, until a receptacle is pro- vided for the urine,—or a bladder may be tied to it so as to receive the fluid, without any risk of allowing its beiag spilt upon the clothes. If the catheter has a stopcock upon it, this will be managed stiU. more conveniently, but the instrument is thus rendered rather too complicated for its easy introduction. When the uterus is distended, and more especially when its contents descend low in the pelvis during parturition, the urethra is liable to such compression and displacement as frequently induce retention of mine. In such circumstances, it is not always practicable to introduce the common female catheter, and one either flexible, or, if rigid, curved like that for the male urethra, is required. The difliculty is stiU greater when the re- tention depends upon retroversion of the uterus. This displace- ment consists in a turning back of the fundus of the uterus, and its being bent down between the vagina and rectum. It very rarely occurs in the unimpregnated state, though it is said to have been met with in virgins, and is most apt to happen between the third and fourth months of pregnancy, in conse- quence of some sudden motion of the trunk, as in leaping or dancing. A consideration of the relative situation and connec- tion of the OS iiten and urethra will render it obvious that the effect of such a retroversion on the latter must be a great extension of it upwards and forwards ; withdrawing the orifice from its usual situation ; impeding the discharge of the lu-ine, and rendering the introduction of a catheter extremely difificult. The bladder becoming distended, reacts on the primary disease, and opposes the replacement of the uterus, whence the first object in the treatment is to draw off its contents. This may sometimes be done by means of a flexible or cur\'-ed sUver catheter ; but it has happened repeatedly that such instruments could not be introduced, and the patient either died from extra- ^ vasation of urine, or was saved by puncture of the bladder abovePELVIS. 423 the pubis. Should that operation be judged necessary, it is to be perfoimed in the same way as in the male ; but especial care must be taken in introducing the trocar not to transfix the elon- gated and naiTowed neck of the bladder, which may happen by directing the instrument perpendicularly, instead of l^ackwards towards the promontory of the sacrum. Tlie uterus. also has been punctured from the rectum ; but this proceeding must be regarded as unwarrantable, unless the other more safe measures have been tried without success. When the resistance of the -.^ distended bladder has been removed, the sui-geon should intro- / duce the fore and middle fingers of one hand into the rectum, while the other co-operates in tbe vagina, and endeavour to replace the retroverced uterus. It may be observed that females, who suffer from uterine ex- citement or hysterical affections, are apt to complain of inability to excrete the urine, and the catheter is often used in such cases ; but warm fomentations applied to the hypogastrium, and cathartic injections thrown into the rectum, will almost always obviate any real necessity for its employment in such circumstances. Urinary Gcdculi in the Female. Females seem to be much less liable to the formation of renal calculi than the other sex, and get quit of them more readily when they do occur, owing to the shortness, width, and dilata- bHity of their urethra. Sometimes, however, calculi are detained after desoending from the kidney, and nuclei for concretion are also occasionally afforded by foreign bodies introduced from with- out, through the urethra into the bladder. The stones, which have their foundation laid in either of these ways, increase in magnitude in the maimer already explained, and occasion symp- toms analogous to those formerly described. Frequent micturi- tion, the urine tinged with blood, and aggravation of these complaints by rough motion, excite the suspicion of calculus in the bladder, especially if the patient has previously suffered the symptoms which indicate the presence of one in the kidney or ureter, and the introduction of a catheter or sound ascertains its424 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. existence positively. Women between tlie ages of twenty and fifty are most frequently tlie subjects of the disease. The female urethra being not only very short and wide in its natural state, but also very dilatable, allows small stones to be seized and extracted through it very readily. But when the calculus obtains a larger size, it is necessary to enlarge the open- ing by incision. This may be readily effected by dilating the orifice so as to admit the finger, and upon it guiding a knife through the resisting ring at the neck of the bladder, after which the textures readily yield. K the stone is very large, so that it requires the vagina to be cut, silver siitures should be introduced to keep the edges in contact. Incontinence of Urine. Incontinence, or involuntary discharge of urine, is rarely met J with in females, but occurs very often in males. It happens at I all ages, and depends on different circumstances. In children, I who are frequently subject to it during their sleep, the cause i seems to be irritability of the bladder, inducing its expulsive ' contraction before the fluid accumulates in sufficient quantity to occasion uneasiness enough for awakening the patient. The fear of punishment, or some other strong impression on the mind, may break this disagreeable habit, by inducing a more vigorous resistance on the part of the voluntary muscles situated at the neck of the bladder; since, as is well known, vpHtion is not entirely suspended dvxring sleep. A more powerful remedy, and one that seldom fails when the morbid disposition has no other source than that under consideration, is the application of a large blister over the sacrum and lower part of the loins. A very dis- tressing incontinence is met with in persons of more advanced age, and often in the vigour of life, who have suffered derange- ment of the nervous system, either from spontaneous disease or . j the effects of external injury. The complaint is then usually I associated with weakness of the inferior extremities, which I betrays the nature of its origin, but it sometimes exists alone, \ and is of itself sufficient to render the patient miserable. Power-PELVIS. 425 ful counter-irritation, especially that effected by the actual cautery applied on each side of the spinous processes of the lower lumbar vertebrae, affords the best chance of relief; and internal stimulants, as cantharides, may be conjoined with this practice, though there is seldom decided evidence of their exert- ing any beneficial influence. Warm and cold bathing, frictions, and strict attention to the preservation of general health, should at the same time be diligently employed ; and improvement must not be despaired of though it should be a long while of appear- ing. Incontinence is common in old age; but in this case is generally confined to the period of sleep, and may be prevented from proving troublesome by introducing the catheter previous to the time of rest. In extreme cases of incontinence, when there is a constant dribbling from the urethra, the patient may be rendered comparatively comfortable by attaching to the penis a bag of India rubber, provided with a plug or stop-cock, for allow- ing the urine to escape when a convenient opportimity occurs. Imtdbility _qr Chronic In^mmation of the Bladder. This complaint is almost confined to males. It is charac- terised by frequent desire to make water, and inability to resist these calls, however incessant or inconvenient. The feeling before micturition is generally more or less painful, and some- times extremely so, whence stone 'or stricture is often supposed to be present, and this supposition leads to the introduction of instruments that greatly aggravate the patient's sufferings. The disease usually occurs in young and middle-aged men. It is occasioned by various circumstances, siTch as over-distension, which in the first instance causes paralysis of the muscular fibres, the irritation of stimulating food, or chronic inflammation, spreading back from the urethra, or originating in the mucous coat of the bladder, in consequence of exposure to cold, or other exciting causes of inflammatory derangement. The treatment consists in using measures of a soothing nature, of which rest, both of mind and body, is an essential one. This, together with a mUk diet, copious diluent drinks, and the hip-bath, sometimes426 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. proves sufficient. In more severe, cases, injections, of two or three ounces of warm water, with a few drops of laudanum, or the sedative solution of opium, may be thrown into the rectum once a day or oftener. Benefit is also derived on some occasions from hyoscyamus' and camphor, administered in the form of pill, also from ten or twelve drops of balsam of copaiva, with five ov- six of the sedative solution, taken two or three times a day, and from small doses of Dover's powder, with colchicum. 1 Blisters applied to the sacrum or perineum, contrary to what might be expected, sometimes afford relief, and a setou in the latter situation has succeeded after the trial of other means ^ I in vain. The operation of vesicoe lotura, or injecting the bladder, has often been used with temporary but seldom with any per- manent advantage, A solution of the nitrate of silver is intro- duced by means of a catheter and syringe, or elastic bag, in such quantity as the irritable bladder is capable of receiving, and allowed to remain untU the desu'e of exx^ulsion leads to its discharge. In cases which derive benefit from this practice, it is observed that the quantity of fluid injected, and the time it is per- mitted to remain, gradually increase. The disease generally proves ( extremely obstinate, and is not unfrequently found incurable. Catarrh of the Bladder. This title is applied to an inordinate secretion of mucus from the bladder, and discharge of it in the urine, at the bottom of which, when voided, it forms a glairy sediment, sometimes nearly equal in quantity to the fluid. The disease usually occurs associated with the one last mentioned, and, though not necessarily accompanying, hardly exists independently of it. What has been said in regard to the causes and treatment of that affection will therefore apply equally to this. Hcematuria. This, as the name implies, is a discharge of blood, which may occur as a symptom of other diseases, or exist as an independent affection. In the latter case, the hemorrhage is sometimes veryPELVIS. 427 profuse, and the blood coagulating in the bladder' gives rise to very unpleasant consequences, to remedy wMch it has been thought necessary to introduce a very wide catheter, having a syringe adapted to it for sucking out the clots. The discharge of blood may take place either from the surface of the mucous membrane, or from a morbid structure into which it has degene- rated. In the latter case, remedial means can be of jio use, but in the former it is generally possible to moderate and even subdue the morbid flow, by correcting any derangement of the system that has indii-ectly occasioned it, by soothing the parts concerned if they indicate excitement, and by administering the tincture of muriate of iron, the uva wrsi, or other astringent medicines. This disease is most common in advanced age, and may occur to an alarming extent without proving either perma- nent or seriously injurious. Confinement to bed in the hori- zontal posture, a mild diet, and palliation of the symptoms, constitute all the treatment requisite for recovery.PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. 428 CHAPTEE XIX. DISEASES OF THE GENITAL OEGANS. Gonorrhcea. By Gonorrhoea is understood an inflammatory affection of the urethra, attended with a discharge of thick yellow fliiid. As the inflammatory symptoms subside, the discharge becomes thinner, paler, and at last almost watery, when it constitutes what is called a Gleet. Tliis disease is usually the result of impure intercourse; but whether it requires for its production that the person infecting should have been infected—in other words, whether it is to be ascribed to the influence of a peculiar poison transmitted from one person to another—is not yet fully ascer- tained. There is great variety m the susceptibility of different individuals, and the matter seems active in proportion to its thiclmess and yellowness. The watery discharge of a gleet, in persons of ordinary sensibility to irritation, is innocuous, but in others it may occasion the most violent gonorrhoea. The first symptoms of the disease generally appear from one to four days after the poison has been applied. They consist in itching, redness, and swelling of the orifice of the urethra, and are soon succeeded by a painful burning sensation in the same part, particularly severe during micturition, the calls to which are much more frequent than usual A thin serous exudation then takes place, at first merely gluing together the edges of the orifice, but quickly becoming more copious, and at the same time acqiuring a purulent appearance. While these local changes are occurring, the system suffers general derangement in proportion to its irritability, and the acuteness of the inflammation. This symptomatic fever is often attended with local disturbance ofGENITAL ORGANS. 429 different parts. The absorbent vessels of the penis, the glands of the groin, and the testicle, are apt to inflame ; abscesses form exterior to the urethra; the prostate and bladder participate in the diseased action; and various important consequences thus ensue, which will be particularly considered hereafter. The primary and essential morbid action is confined to the extremity of the urethra, from its orifice to the distance of an inch back- wards. The treatment requires, in the first place, purgation, and the antiphlogistic regimen, to moderate the inflammation, and allay the fever. The patient at the same time should drink freely of dUuent mucUaginous fluids, such as rice-water, or linseed tea, and foment the penis frequently with warm water. When the intensity of the disease has been subdued, internal and external means may be employed to stop the discharge. Of the former, the balsam of copaiva and cubeb pepper are the most powerful; and they act much more certainly when administered in sub- stance, than when their virtues are attempted to be concentrated by decomposition into extracts or essences. As the copaiva is not only extremely nauseous, but apt to excite sickness, vomit- ing, and great general tmeasiness, it must be given cautiously, in small doses, combined with camphorated mixture, spirit of nitrous ether, or some such vehicle, and a little laudanum or muriate of morphia. The cubebs may be given more freely, either along with the mixture just mentioned or alone. One or two drachms may be prescribed two, three, or four times a day, either alone or together with the balsam; but in general I believe it is better to abstain entirely from the use of internal remedies, and trust entirely to local means. These are injections of astringent fluids into the urethra. For this purpose the solu- tions of alum and several metallic salts, as the sulphates of zinc and copper, the acetates of lead and zinc, and the nitrate of silver, are chiefly employed. No injections should ever be employed untU the symptoms of acute inflammation have been subdued ; and even then, if the patient has an irritable constitution, they ought to be prescribed with extreme caution. Not more than aPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 430 I quarter of an ounce should be thrown in at once, and the penis should be compressed between the finger and thumb, to prevent the fluid from passing too far back. The injection may be repeated three or four times a day, unless it occasions a renewal of the inflammatory symptoms, when it must be immediately abandoned. If, notwithstanding these means, the running con- tinues several weeks, a full-sized bougie may be passed two or three times, as the initation thus caused, though its first effect is to render the matter discharged more thick and copious, often puts a sudden stop to it. The tincture of cantharides in the dose of twenty or thirty drops three times a day, sulphate of ziac, given internally in the form of pHl, and sea-bathing, are the remaining remedies usually had recourse to when the gleet proves obstinate. The first gonorrhoea is generally more severe than those that happen subsequently. In these the inflam- matory symptoms are often from the commencement so mild that the means proper for arresting the discharge may be used without delay. Of the bad consequences or attendants of gonorrhoea, one of the most frequent is chordee or painful erection of the penis. The only effectual remedy of it is to cure the disease ; but before this is accomplished, the patient's sufferings may be alleviated by opiate injections into the rectum,—the introduction of opiate suppositories within the sphincter ani,—or pUls of camphor with hyoscyamus taken occasionally. If the spongy or cavernous substance of the penis remains hard after the inflammation has subsided, and causes pain, together with distortion of the member when it is erected, the part affected may be rubbed with cam- phorated mercurial ointment, to promote absorption of the con- densing lymph that is effused. Inflamed absorbents are met with chiefly on the dorsal surface of the penis, and in persons of a very irritable constitution. They form hard painful cords, over which the skin is red. The best application that can be made to them is a warm solution of acetate of lead and opium. In- flammation of the inguinal glands, or Bubo, does not occur nearly' so frequently in consequence of the irritation of gonon'hcea, as ofGENITAL ORGANS. 431 tliat proceeding from sores of the penis, and, therefore, may be more properly considered in connection with them. Abscesses sometimes form in the cellular substance exterior to the urethra, at all parts of its extent, from the orifice back to the anus. So soon as they are recognised, an incision ought to be made for the evacuation of the matter, which, if permitted to make a way for itself, may cause ulcerative absorption of the mucous membrane. "When the inflammation spreads back along the urethra to the bladder, it induces the painful symptoms which have been described under the head of Eetention of urine from spasm, and irritable bladder, and requires the treatment that has been already explained in regard to them. Inflammation of the testicle is a common attendant of gonorrhoea, but will be more conveniently arranged along with the other morbid affections of that organ. Gonorrjicea Preputialis. A purulent discharge is occasionally induced from the surface of the glans and prepuce in persons who have this covering long, and the lining integument of its inner surface approximating the nature of a mucous membrane. From the tightness of the pre- puce in such cases, it is generally difficult to bring the orifice of the urethra into view, and the source of the running is, in conse- quence, often referred erroneously to the usual seat of gonorrhoea. As this mistake leads to improper practice, it ought to be avoided by carefully di-awing back the fore-skin until the opening of the urethra comes into view, and then squeezing the penis so as to force out the matter, which wiU shew, by the direction whence it comes, where it has been secreted. The absence of pain in making water affords another good ground of dis- tinction between this form of the disease and the other. The treatment consists in injecting the black wash four or five times a day between the glans and prepuce. Warts. A very common consequence of gonorrhoea, particularly of the preputial kind, is the growth of warty excrescences, chiefly432 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. round the neck of the glans, and by the side of the frojnum ; but they may be seated on any or every part of the surface of the glans and prepuce. These growths vary extremely, both in size and number, being sometimes hardly percex^tible, and at others constituting large tumoiirs. . They have generally narrow necks, and irregular, rough bodies. They are painful and unseemly, apt to bleed when injured, and, if large, attended with a very fcetid discharge. If small, their absorption may be readily induced by a slight application of aromatic vinegar once every two or three days. Various other fluids, powders, and oint- ments, have been employed for tliis purpose; but the one that has been mentioned seems to be, on the whole, the best. When the warts are large, they shordd be cut away with scissors close to the sound skin, and even when but of small size, they are removed in this way more quickly as well as effectually. Sores on the Penis. The penis, like every other part of the body, is Hable to become the seat of ulceration; and its pendulous position, mobility, and proneness to erection, much oppose the healing process. With few exceptions, the sores in this situation result from venereal intercourse, being either simply abrasions or lacerations, or the consequence of the irritation of poisonous matter applied to the organ. The former are usually called ex- coriations, and the latter chancres. The poison gives rise to the ulcer by forming, in the first instance, a small abscess or pustule, which, opening in a few days, leaves a breach in the surface. If an excoriation, at the time of its production, is exposed to the influence of irritating matter, it then exhibits the same cha- racters as if of poisonous origin. The sores of both kinds are generally seated on the lining membrane of the prepuce, near its reflection on the glans, at its orifice, and at the sides of the froenum; being more rarely found on the glans itself, or the body of the penis. Wlien resulting from poison, they are generally small, round, or oval, and excavated, having the base as well as the margin condensed by an interstitial effusion ofGENITAL ORGANS. 433 lymph, aud affordiug a viscid discharge. Wheu caused by violence, they are usually of an irregular figure, and surrounded with more or less hardness, according to the irritation which they have suffered from the matter applied to them. The surface of both kinds is generally grey, yellowish, or ash-coloured, and shews no appearance of granulations. The pain is very variable. When the sore is in a highly irritable state, it usually presents either a phagedenic or sloughing character. In the former case the ulcer, which is generally seated on the body of the penis, is round, shallow, and very abrupt at the margin, which is red, while the surrounding integuments are not altered from their ordinary state. It is very painful, and increases progressively, preserving the characters that have been described, and enlarging in superficial extent without becoming deeper. In the slough- ing state the sore is surrounded with much tense swelling, and difPiised redness. The pain' is intense ; and the margin of the sore, which is very irregular, at one or more parts exhibits sphacelated spots. Owing to the peculiarities of their situation, and also of ^ the circumstances which attend their production, sores on the penis are generally very slow in healing, unless properly treated, and even then often require more time for the purpose than might be expected from their size. It was very generally believed uijtil lately, and the opinion is still maintained by many, that the poison which gave rise to chancres was of a peculiar kind, which had not existed in Europe until the latter part of the fifteenth century, when it suddenly appeared at the siege of Kaples, having either originated there, or been brought by Spanish soldiers who had imported it from the newly discovered Western World. This poison of Syphilis, as it has been called, was supposed to produce various other effects besides the primary sore, when absorbed from it into the system: first causing bubo, and then a succession of constitutional dis- orders that were termed secondary symptoms. Of these the most important were scaly eruptions of the skin, ulceration of the fauces, exfoliation of the bones of the nose, chronic inflam- 2 FPBINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 434 mation of the periosteum and bones, ulcers on the surface of the body, cachectic emaciation, and death. It was further believed that mercmy, administered so as to produce its constitutional effect, or feverish excitement with salivation, acted as a certain antidote to this poison, whether operating locally or generally; but that unless it encountered the poison previously to being absorbed from the sores, it merely arrested the morbid derange- ment in progress, without preventing the occurrence of the other secondary symptoms, which required successive courses of sali- vation for their remedy. It is now fuUy ascertained that the poison of the present day, though producing local effects in all respects similar to those described as resulting from syphilis, does not give rise to the dreadful consequences which have just been mentioned, when treated without mercury. The cure may be tedious, and the skin, throat, or periosteum may be slightly affected, but none of the serious effects that used to be so much dreaded ever appear; and even the trivial ones just noticed comparatively seldom present themselves. "We must therefore conclude, either that the violence of the poison is worn out, or that the effects formerly attributed to it depended on the treat- ment. The latter of these opinions is supported by the fact, that secondary sjrmptoms of the utmost severity, embittering the patient's existence, and ultimately destroying it, are still met with in the practice of those who employ mercury profusely and indiscriminately; and it is a curious circumstance, which cannot be either explained or denied, that this medicine produces these effects, more especially those on the bones, only in persons who are suffering from venereal ulceration of the genital organs. The quantity of mercury requisite for thus injuriously affecting the system is very variable—depending upon peculiarities of the patient's constitution, either natural or acquired. Of the former, a scrofulous disposition may be particularly mentioned; and of the latter, one of the most important is that occasioned by mercury itself, sitice a person who has taken it to such an extent as to have been disordered by its operation, is ever after very susceptible of its effect. It is generally noticed tliat thoseGENITAL OKGANS. 435 persons suffer most from mercury wlio are least readily salivated by it, A fearful system of scientific quackery has, in recent times, been founded upon the ruins of the old mercurial delusion, and although the so-called " modified use of mercury," which is at present so much the fashion in Paris and elsewhere, may not be so speedy in its effect, I can testify, from what has frequently fallen under my observation, that it empties the pocket and injures the health no less effectually than the process of poison- ing which it professes to have so advantageously superseded. In cases where mischief has been done by the administration of mercury, it is sometimes necessary to employ an antidote, and for this purpose the iodide of potassium, in small doses, has ren- dered the most valuable service. The preparations of sarsapa- rUla are also much employed to counteract the effect of mercury, as well as syphilis; and the faith in their eificacy is so firmly established, that any expression of my belief that they are utterly inert could hardly excite doubt except iu the minds of those who have witnessed my hospital practice, throughout the whole course of which not a grain of sarsaparilla has ever been prescribed. The local treatment must be varied according to the circum- stances of the case. In the first rustance, as soon as possible after the appearance of the disease, it is proper to destroy the morbid action of the part by touching it with the nitrate of silver ; and then the black-wash, or a solution of sulphate of copper, containing two grains in an ounce, may be applied on a piece of lint. If the orifice of the prepuce is contracted so as to prevent it from being drawn back, the black-wash should be injected four or five times a day, which is better than laying open the foreskin, as the cut surface is sure to take on a simUar action with that of the ulcers, and thus prolong the cure. When the sore has a phagedenic character, a bread and milk poultice is generally the most useful application in the first instance, for a few days, and then a strong solution" of sulphate of copper, containing a scruple to the oimce, used merely to' moisten thePEINCIPLES OF SURGEKV. 436 surface once a day, with some milder lotion in the inteiTals, proves most efficient in arresting the progress of the ulceration, as well as promoting granulation. The disposition to slough depends on excessive irritability, which in general is owing to too great a power of action, and requires measures of depletion, together with those of a soothing kind. Leeching, scarifying, fomenting, and poulticing, acetate of lead, and watery solutions of opium, are the means found most useful for this purpose, and all of them, except the two first, may be used with advantage also when the irritability is associated with weakness of the part. In mercurial sloughing of a chronic character, the best counteragent is caustic potass gently applied. If secondary symptoms appear, they ought to be treated merely on the ordinary principles which guide the practice in regard to them proceeding from other causes. In affections of the skin and throat, it is much better to abstain from mercury altogether, and either trust entirely to local means, together with a suitable regimen, or employ iodine in some of the forms in which it is usually prescribed. In affections of the periosteum or bones, which, as already mentioned, never occur in a severe form except when the patient has suffered from the mercurial influence, iodine is also found eminently useful, the appropriate local treatment, and especially the regulated application of blisters, being at the same time employed. Should it fail in affording relief, corrosive sublimate may be administered, in very small doses, such as the eighth or sixteenth of a grain two or three times a day, given either solid or in solution, and com- bined with some anodyne or diaphoretic vehicle. If mercury were never used improperly, the treatment of venereal diseases, both primary and secondary, would be very easy; and as its abuse is every day becoming less common, there is reason to hope that the formidable class of mercurial diseases, on which volumes have been written, and particularly ulcers of this origin on the genitals, skin, mouth, and throat, will soon cease to be met with in practice. In regard to them, it wiU be sufficient to state at present, that time, careful attention to theGENITAL ORGANS. 437 general healtli, and for local applications, the nitrate of silver, sulphate of copper, and the black-wash, are in general the best remedies. When the obstinacy of the sore is excessive, it may be necessary to destroy the surface by caustic potass. Bubo. The irritation of a sore on the genitals, of whatever kind, or wherever situated, especially if aggravated by exercise or intem- perance, is veiy apt to occasion swelling and inflammation of the inguinal glands. The buboes thus produced differ in no respect, so far as regards their treatment, from those which owe their origin to other sources; and an erroneous opinion, that formerly led to the most mischievous consequences, namely, that, when caused by chancres, they were tainted with the syphilitic poison, and required a course of mercury for their removal, is now happily exploded. The mercury which, imder this idea, used to be constantly prescribed in their treatment, by exciting fever and increasing the irritability of the system, often occasioned the most destructive phagedenic or sloughing effects, and, when less obviously injurious, rendered the ulcers that resulted from the buboes extremely obstinate, and some- times almost incurable. Instead of thus encouraging the irritation, the object should be to soothe and allay it as much as possible. Whenever the patient begins to feel pain in his groin, he should desist from walking, assume the horizontal posture, and foment the parts, two or three times a day, with hot water. When swelling is perceived, leeches are usually applied; and certainly almost always with the effect, in the first instance, of lessening the timiour and diminishing the redness. But there seems to be good reason for thinldng that the local abstraction of blood is apt to render the morbid process more slow and obstinate, so that the patient suffers much more than if the disease had not been thus retarded. Wann fomentations, cathartics, and, above all, healing of the sores, are the most effectual means for resolving the inflammation; while, if suppuration does take place, thesePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 438 means are conducive to its speedy and perfect accomplishment. If the swelling proves very indolent, blisters are often very useful in effecting discussion, or hastening suppuration, if it is in progress ; and it not unfrequently happens that these means excite absorption of the pus even after it is distinctly perceptible by fluctuation, which is always very desirable, as a breach of the integuments ought, if possible, to be avoided in persons whose sluggishness of local action indicates a bad constitution. When the matter is fully formed, it should be evacuated by free in- cision, after which the cavity may be poulticed for a few days, and then dressed with a metallic wash. Should the surface present an unsound appearance, caustic potass oiight to be em- ployed for its destruction. If the glandular structure protrudes through the aperture, or rises above the bottom of the cavity in spongy-looking, ash-coloured masses, it may either be subjected to the action of caustic, or first be removed in part by the knife or scissors. Should sinuses exist, owing to the aperture being too small or unfavourably situated, they are to be laid fairly open, or blistered if deep. In patients of feeble constitution, starvation and confinement are often the sources of obstinacy in the resulting idcer, and must be obviated by an alteration of regimen. If the system has been injured by mercury, recovery is sometimes rendered extremely tedious. In such cases, the gradual restoration of healthy action, which takes place through time, and the use of iodine with cod-liver oil, together with the external application of blisters, caustic, black-wash, or sulphate of zinc lotion, may be confided in as the best means of promoting recovery. When buboes present a phagedenic or sloughing character, they must be treated on the same principles as sores of the penis in similar circumstances. Phymosis. By Phymosis is understood a condition of the prepuce in which it cannot be draw back so as to expose the glans. This condition may be either permanent or temporary ; in the fomer case depending on the smaU size of the orifice, and in the latter439 GENITAL ORGANS. resulting from swelling of the prepuce or parts contained within it. Permanent narrowness of the opening may be either con- genital, or caused by the contraction that occurs during the cicatrization of ulcers. It is inconvenient on many accounts ; and, in particular, exposes the individual to an aggravated foim of aU the diseases which affect the parts concerned. The tempo- rary phymosis is a very common consequence'of gonorrhoea, sores on the inner surface of the prepuce, and warts. The swelling is attended with redness and pain, and is not only distressing in this way, but reacts on the disease which occasioned it, and renders the symptoms more severe, as well as the treatment more difficult. The treatment of permanent phymosis requires dilatation of the orifice by incision, and this may be effected in various ways. Circumcision, or the removal of the prepuce with a knife or scissors, is easily performed, but deprives the glans of its covering. It sometimes happens, particularly in advanced age, that the prepuce becomes greatly elongated, thickened, and hardened, and then this mode of proceeding is the best, indeed the only one practicable. The ordinary plan is to slit open the prepuce, simply inserting one stitch at the termination of the incision to prevent separation of the cut edges, but this method also exposes the glans, and leaves redundant flaps of skin, which are apt to prove troublesome. The best operation, on the whole, seems to consist in cutting off a circular ring-like portion from the ex- tremity of the prepuce, drawing back the loose external skin, then slitting the internal membrane, on one or both sides, nearly as far back as the neck of the glans, and, lastly, stitching its cut edge to that of the skin. In cases of slight contraction, instead of removing any part of the prepuce, it is sufficient to divide the internal membrane so far as may be necessary by repeated snips of the scissors while it is exposed by drawing back the skin, and then stitching together the cut edges. The temporary form of this disease requires soothing measures, to allay the inflammation on which it immediately depends. Eest, hot fomentations, and, if the symptoms are very acute,440 ■ PRINCIPLES OF SURGEBY. general depletion, together with leeches or scarifications, are the most effectual means for this purpose. If sores exist, they must be treated according to the prkiciples already explained; and the operation for phymosis ought to be avoided if possible, even though the contraction may have existed in a permanent form previous to their production. In this case the prepuce should be restored to its ordinary state before being laid open, as the cure will thus be completed in a few days instead of weeks, which would probably be required if the incision were made during the diseased condition of the parts. Nevertheless if the sores prove very obstinate or irritable, this inconvenience must be encountered ; but a careful and patient trial should always in the first instance be given to those means that are calculated to supersede the necessity of an operation. When the phymosis depends upon or is connected with warts, the prepuce should withoiit delay be sKt open, as these excrescences cannot be removed so long as it remains contracted. It sometimes happens, in consequence of phymosis being associated with an ulcerated state of the respective surfaces of the glans and pre- puce, that adhesion takes place between them. Attempts have been made to remedy this preternatural connection by dissection and careful interposition of dressings ; but this procedure, which is extremely painful, hardly does any good, as the strong ten- dency to contract during cicatrization reduces the parts nearly to the same state in wliich they were previously to the operation. In such cases, however, it is found advantageous to slit open the prepuce as far as it is not adherent to the glans. Pamplvymosis. In Paraphymosis the orifice of the prepuce is drawn back behind the glans, and causes compression or strangulation of its neck. This can happen only where the opening is narrow, with- out being so much so as to occasion complete phymosis. The narrowest pait of the prepuce is just at the orifice, where the skin and mucous membrane meet; and when it is drawn back so as to denude the glans, the internal lining is apt to protrude441 GENITAL ORGANS. more or less beyond the ring thus formed, so that the Seat of the stricture is not exactly behind the neck of the- glans, but separ- ated from it by a circular swelling caused by distension of the protruded internal membrane. A penis suffering from paraphy- mosis thus presents anteriorly the point of the glans in a tumid state,—then a circular swelling of mucous membrane,—next a deep sulcus, at the bottom of which is seated the stricture, formed by the narrow orifice of the prepuce,—and, lastly, the integuments of the penis more or less swollen. Paraphymosis occurs at all ages, but most frequently in boys. It is readily recognised by the appearances which have been described, and the symptoms it occasions by impeding the circulation. These are, in addition to the swelling, pain, and other indications of inflammation, which, in circumstances favourable to intensity of action, may terminate in sloughing, but more frequently proves its own cure, by induc- ing tdceration at the seat of stricture. The treatment obviously requires the use of means proper for effecting reduction of the strictured glans, and the manipulation for this purpose should be conducted on the same principles as those of the taxis for hernia. The surgeon having anointed the glans with oil, embraces it between the points of the thumb and fingers of Ms right hand, while with those of the left he makes counter-pressure on the constricting ring. He gently but steadily compresses it for some minutes, and then by a combination of pushing and rotation, endeavours to press its neck within the stricture. If this proceeding fails, which it very seldom does when properly executed, he separates the swellings on each side of the stricture by bending down the extremity of the penis, so as to bring the tense cord-lil<:e portion of the skin which constitutes it into view; and then, with a sharp-pointed curved knife, makes a small incision at this part, about a line in length and depth. The reduction is now readily effected, unless the parts should have become consolidated by adhesive effusion, in consequence of the disease having been permitted to exist a number of days or weeks, in which case, just as in hernial protrusions that prove irreducible after the stricture has been divided, the completion ofPEINCIPLE3 OF SUEGERY. 442 the operation must be trusted to the gradual effects of that ten- dency to reparation which is exerted by the system. The penis should be enveloped ia lint moistened with acetate of lead lotion, and the patient ought to maintain the horizontal posture, until the parts resume their natural condition. Cancer of tJie Penis. The penis is frequently the seat of cancer. Ulcers on it often assume the most alarming appearance, and exhibit extreme in- disposition to heal, ia consequence of constitutional peculiarities, especially that induced by the prejudicial use of mercury; but such sores should be carefully distinguished from those of a truly carcinomatous nature. The latter are met with in persons of ad- vanced age. They are characterised by the inequality of their surface, the cartilaginous hardness of their base, their fetid dis- charge, and lancinating pain. The inguinal and Uiac glands become affected in the progi'ess of the disease, and the patient dies hectic from continued irritation. The only remedy that affords any prospect of a radical cure is removal of the morbid part, and this, of course, only when the glands are untainted. The operation, therefore, ought to be per- formed without delay, so soon as the disease is distinctly recog- nised to be of this malignant kind. The penis may be amputated without any ceremony,—care only being taken that the whole of the disease is removed, together with a portion of the neigh- bouring sound tissues. The integuments are more apt to prove redundant than defective, and therefore need not be saved by drawing them back previous to division. The arteries that require ligatures are to be tied, and the oozing of blood may be restrained by the application of cold water, or by effecting pressure on the stump after a flexible catheter has been introduced into the bladder. Lest the orifice of the urethra should contract during the cure, a bougie must be introduced occasionally to preserve its proper width.GENITAL ORGANS. 443 Diseases of the Testicle. Inflammation, or Hernia Humoralis. The Testicle is excited to .inflame by a variety of circum- stances, of "wMch the most important, in respect to their fre- quency, are bruises, woimds, gonorrhoeal inflammation, either spreading back along the continuous surface between the urethra and testicle, or suddenly suffering a metastasis to the latter situa- tion, and the irritation proceeding from.strictures, or the means employed to cure them. The symptoms are pain, hardness, and swelling, with more or less redness ; and in acute cases, there is not only feverish disturbance of the system, but also, sickness, vomitiQg, and constipation, similar to those attending strangu- lated hernia, in consequence of the testicle being connected, in its sympathies, with the viscera' of the abdomen. When the inflam- mation is intense, it may prove fatal; but, in general, it is merely productive of temporary distress, and exposes the patient to the risk of serous effusion, chronic enlargement, and altera- tion of structure, which are frequently its consequences. The most violent cases met with are those caused by wounds of the gland; and such injuries are, therefore, regarded as dangeroiis, particularly in irritable constitutions. • The treatment of inflamed testicle must be regulated by the circumstances of the case. If there is redness of the skin, and other indications of acute action, blood should be abstracted locally, either by applying leeches or by opening some of the veins of the scrotum with a lancet. If the latter mode is chosen, the patient should stand erect while the veins are punctured, and as long as it is desired that the blood should flow. Warm fomentations applied to the scrotum, emollient injections thrown into the rectum, occasional doses of castor-oil, and a strict anti- phlogistic regimen, are the other means of most use, and, when the symptoms are very severe, should aU be administered, to- gether with opiates, to allay the tendency to excessive action. In mild cases it is generally sufficient to evacuate the bowelsPEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. not amenable to the ordinary treatment, but I have ascertained freely, enjoin rest in the horizontal posture, and apply a lotion of acetate of lead with opium to the scrotum. After the pain and tenderness have subsided, a degree of swelling frequently remains, for which discutient applications should be em- ployed, but with due caution, so as not to occasion a relapse, by producing too much irritation. Hydrocele. By Hydrocele is understood an accumulation of serous fluid in the cavity of the tunic(x_ vaginalis^ or confined to the part covering the spermatic cord. In the former case, which is by far the most common, the swelling has generally a pyramidal figure, the large extremity being downwards,—is devoid of pain and sensibility, except at the lower and back part where the testicle lies,—appears translucent when placed between the eye and a candle in a dark chamber,—and is felt to fluctuate when pressed between the fingers alternately. In hydroceles of old standing and large size, the tunica vaginalis often becomes dis- tended to an equal size quite up to the external ring, and so thickened that no translucency can be perceived. The fluctua- tion, insensibility to pressure except in the region of the testicle, and the history of the case, are then the only diagnostics from a swelling of the gland; and, if they should leave any doubt, it may be removed by a puncture. From hernia, hydrocele may always be distinguished by compressing the neck of the tumom- between the fingers. In hydrocele of the cord, as collections of fluid in this situation are named, the swelling is usually a'oiind pr^ oval, fluctuating, and translucent, leaving the testicle quite distinct, so that it may be felt on aU sides. It is some- times associated with the other form of the disease, and can then hardly be recognised except by evacuating one or other of the sacs. The title of Spermatocele has been aj)plied to hydi-ocele of the cord when its contents are colourless, slightly opalescent, and present numerous spermatozoa under the microscope. It was thought that this character denoted a form of the disease445 GENITAL ORGANS. that there is no good ground for such a distinction, though it is true that as the swelling is generally of a small size, and little dis- posed to increase, there is seldom much occasion for interference. The origin of hydrocele may sometimes be referred to blows or other sources of irritation, but is in general very obscure. The existence of a predisposition to the disease is rendered probable by the fact, that the fluid sometimes collects first on one side, and then, perhaps after an interval of years, appears on the other. The complaint generally commences about middle age, but is met with at all periods of life. Infants sometimes labour under it, either in consequence of the tunica vaginalis continuing to communicate with the cavity of the abdomen, and allowing fluid effused there to descend into it—a condition that has also, though ver}' rarely, been observed in the adult —or simply effusion from some source of irritation often not observable. The treatment of the disease is either palliative or radical. The former consists in merely drawing off the fluid ; the latter in doing so, and at the same time preventing its re-accumulation. The tapping of a hydrocele is best performed with a small trocar, which should be introduced at the anterior surface, about a third of the length of the tumour from the bottom, and at an equal distance from both sides. There is here least risk of woimding any large vessels, and the greatest separation of the tunica vaginalis from the testicle, to avoid which more effectually the instrument ought to be pushed gently and steadily through the parietes of the sweUing, while they are held tight with the left hand embracing it, and directed not perpendiciilarly to the surface, but obliquely upwards. But as the testicle is not by any means constant in its position relatively to the swelling, and as the tunica vaginalis is liable to partial thickenings, which would very much oppose the free introduction of the trocar, the operator should never proceed to puncture until he has examined the parts, and satisfied himself that there is no obstacle in the way of the instrument. This simple operation is proper in cases where it is not certain that the water will be again collected, and446 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY. when the state of the patient's • constitution, from age or other circumstances, renders it imprudent to_ excite any more than the most gentle irritation. It ought always to be performed, before the radical cure is attempted, when the swelling is very large, or when it is necessary to' ascertain, by examining more accurately than can be done while the water still remains, that the con- dition of the testicle is not opposed to the success of the opera- tion required for this purpose. Various methods have been employed for effecting the per- manent cure of hydrocele. Of these the following may be men- tioned :—Incision, Excision, Caustic, Seton, and Injection. The last of these is now almost universally preferred, and it wHl, therefore, be sufficient to notice the others very shortly. Inci- sion, which is the most ancient practice, consisted in laying the cavity of the distended tunica vaginalis freely open, and inducing its obliteration by the granulating process. Inflammation and constitutional disturbance were the necessary consequences of this operation, and not unfrequently proved so violent as to occa- sion gangrene and death. The plan of Excision, though of very old origin, was chiefly practised in the latter part of the last century. It consisted in cutting away an elliptical portion of the integu- ments, together with the whole of the tunica vaginalis, where not adherent to the testicle and cord. This operation, though more tedious and painful in its execution than the former, occasioned less severe consequences, and was followed by a more speedy cure, owing to the serous tissue being in great part removed. The Caustic was applied in the same way as for making an issue. The aperture caused by it could not of course heal by the first intention, and necessarily excited suppuration of the whole surface, which then gradually contracted Like that of an ordinary abscess. This practice was employed during the last century, though not unfrequently attended with serious accidents in irritable constitutions. The Seton was applied to this purpose by Guy de Chauliac, in the fourteenth century, and is mentioned by Fallopius, Pare, and others, but was never very extensively used, either then or in more recent times. Pott strongly recom-447 GENITAL ORGANS. mended it, and has given a. very particular description of the mode of performing the operation. The essential part of it is the introduction of a skein of silk, or cotton, through the parietes of the swelling in its long direction. Inflammation and suppura- tion follow, and at the end of a fortnight the seton being with- drawn, the cure is soon completed. Notwithstanding all the • precautions that can be used, the irritation thus excited some- times occasions an alarming degree of inflammation, and even in the most successful cases a long and irksome confinement is re- quired. The treatment by Injection was first employed by the surgeon of a Scotch regiment, named Munro, in the early part of last century. Various trials of it were made in this and other countries, particularly by Sabatier of Paris; but Sir J. Earle had the merit of introducing it into British practice. The object of the operation is to excite a degree of inflammation, sufficient to occasion such a change in the state of the parts concerned as may prevent the water from returning. An endless variety of fluids have been employed for this purpose, but port wine, solution of sulphate of zinc, and cold water, have been chiefly used untU lately, when the tincture of iodine has come to supersede all the others. There is some difference of opinion as to the mode in which irritating fluids, injected into the tunica vaginalis, act in radically curing the disease. Some have alleged that the respec- tive serous surfaces become finnly united, in consequence of an effusion of lymph from them; and others maintain that there is merely a change produced in the secreting action of the vessels,, which prevents the fluid from re-accumulating, though the cavity remains as perfect as ever. It is probable that the truth lies between these two opinions, and that, though union of the ad- jacent surfaces is not essential to the cure, adhesions generally do take place. The apparatus required for the operation is a smaU trocar, and a syringe capable of containing a quarter of an ounce. The trocar having been introduced as for the paClliative cure, the canula should be pressed in a little further, to insure its con- veying the injection fairly into the cavity of the timica vaginalis.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 448 The fluid is then thrown Lii and allowed to remain. Pain stretch- ing up along the groin, towards the loins, and occasionally slight nausea, are in general experienced during the operation. After it is concluded the patient goes to bed, and seldom feels much inconvenience from what has been done until the following day, when the testicle swells, and more or less fluid is effused iato the vaginal cavity. A slight degree of constitutional disturbance keeps pace with these local changes, and both are usually at their height on the third day. The swelling then begins to lessen, the feverish state subsides, and the patient is able in a few days to resume his ordinary occupation, though several weeks generally elapse before the swelling is completely dis- persed. It is observed that the more solid the swelling conse- quent upon the operation is, the more speedy and complete is the cure. The hydrocele of children does not require the radical opera- tion, as the fluid is readily absorbed under the influence of a discutient lotion, such as a solution of muriate of ammonia with spuits and vinegar, or, at all events, seldom returns if such a lotion be applied after evacuation by a trocar or lancet. Hcematocele. The tunica vaginalis is sometimes distended with fluid, not clear and serous-looldng, but of a dark-brown colour, and when allowed to remain at rest after being drawn off, depositing a layer of florid blood; while the cavity, if laid open, is generally found to contain more or less fibrinous coagulum, partly detached, partly adherent to the sides of the sac. The disease is then named Hsematocele. It is recognised by the characters of hydrocele, with the exception of translucency, which is altogether absent; but, as this feature may depend on unusual thickness of the sac, the only certain diagnostic is obtained by pimcturing the tumom-. Hsematocele is sometimes associated with diseases of the testicle. The origin of the blood which constitutes it is involved in great obsciu-ity; but, on the whole, seems to be ascribed with most probability to hemorrhage from the vessels of the tunica vaginalis.449 GENITAL OEGANS. The disease is almost always a liydrocele in the first instance, and the histoiy usually given of it is, that after the ordinary serous fluid had been drawn off, the swelling returned very rapidly, and upon being tapped again, was found to be filled with the dark-coloured contents above described. In cases of old standing, numerous small scales are observed floating in the fluid, and these when collected are ascertained to consist of cholesterine. Dr. Bostock has suggested, with apparent proba- bility, that they are not the direct result of secretion, but the product of a chemical change taking place in the effused fluid, similar to that by which adipocire is formed from flesh when subjected to long maceration in water. The same sort of scales are found in old collections of albuminous fluid in other parts of the body, and no doubt proceed from the same source. The tunica vaginalis is always very much thickened, sometimes of almost cartilaginous hardness throughout, and occasionally soft and pulpy on its inner surface. I minutely injected the vessels of a htematocele which had been ascertained, by a puncture pre- viously, to be still capable of reproducing the bloody contents, but did not find the shghest extravasation or appearance of rup- ture, either fi'om disease or injury. The remedy of hematocele, as of hydrocele, may sometimes be accomplished by the injection of iodine; but in general thick and diseased tunica vaginalis requires to be laid freely open, or removed in part if very large. The woimd should be dressed with diy lint after the vessels have been tied. Con- siderable constitutional disturbance may be expected ; but, under proper treatment, it seldom proves excessive. Suppura^- tion being induced, the granulating process soon brings the sides of the wound together, and completes the cure. Cirsocele. The veins of the testicle, which enter into the formation of the spermatic cord, are subject to varicose enlargement, parti- cularly on the left side. The vessels become greatly dilated, thickened in their coats, and extremely tortuous. There is thus 2 0450 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. caiisecl a swelling, wliicli alarms the patient, occasions a dragging uneasy feeling in the groin and back, aggravated by standing or wallving, and is itself also sometimes the seat of disagreeable sensations. When the dilatation occurs high in the cord, near the external ring, it sometimes bears a great resemblance to in- giunal hernia. In order to distinguish between the two diseases, the patient is generally laid in the horizontal posture, when the swelling disappears, whether of the one land or the other. Pressure is then made at the ring, and the patient rises, when the swelling will reappear if depending upon vascular enlarge- ment, as the blood cannot thus be prevented from finding its way through the arteries, but the tumour will not return if of a hernial nature. This test, thoiigh often decisive, is frequently ambiguous ; and it seems a more certain means of ascertaining the truth to compress the neck of the swelling, while the patient stands erect, when, if composed of dilated veins, it will become more tense. The same diagnosis is applicable for the recognition of swellings in this situation dependent upon serous effusion between the vessels composing the spermatic cord, which is not unfrequently met with in children, and is apt to be mistaken for hernia. Cirsocele is met with chiefly in young men between twenty and thirty, but frequently occurs soon after puberty. It exists in very various degrees of size, and occasions more or less inconvenience accordingly. It does not seem to interfere with the functions of the testicle. The circumstances which determine the commencement of the disease have not been ascertained. It is certainly more common in persons who have indulged in venereal excesses, but often exists quite unconnected with any such habits. It tends to increase to a certain extent, and then either remains stationary or diminishes. The patient is generally rendered very anxious by the complaint; but the small inconvenience which attends it does not warrant any very severe measiu'es for its relief "Wash- ing with cold water completely removes the swelling for a time, by corrugating the scrotum, and bracing \ip the testicle to the pubis. A suspensory bandage effects this more permanently,GENITAL ORGANS. 451 though not so efficiently ; and an open state of the bowels, with rest in the horizontal posture, contributes to keep the disease within bounds. The means of radical cure consist in extu-pation of the testicle, which can hardly, if ever, be warrantable ;—^liga- ture or transfixion of the veins, which is dangerous and useless ;— the pressure of a spring truss, which is absurd in theory and hurtful in practice ;—and excision of the redundant scrotum. Chronic Enlargement of tlie Testicle. The testicle is very liable to simple enlargement, with har- dening, which produces uneasiness from the bulk and weight attending it, and no doubt impairs the action of the gland ; but is seldom painful or very sensible of external impressions. It is generally irregular on the surface, and dense in. its structure. The circumstances which most frequently give rise to this condi- tion are attacks of inflammation, especially when repeated or badly treated, and chronic irritation of the urethra from stricture or other causes. In commencing the treatment, the first step should always be to examine the state of the urethra by passing a moderate-sized bougie, and if it either meets with obstruction or causes more than usual pain, thus indicating a morbid sensi- bility of the lining membrane, the operation must be repeated with instruments varied according to the nature and peculiari- ties of the case, until there is no longer any trace of disease. Even when the urethra seems to be sound, advantage is occa- sionally derived from the use of bougies, and in a week or two, or sometimes iu a few days, very formidable-looking tumours may thus be discussed. Should the swelUng exist along with a sound state of the urethra, or resist this treatment, means of promoting absorption must be employed. With this view the patient should maintain the horizontal posture, use a very spare diet, and be subjected to a gentle cou.rse of mercury ; at the same time having the absorbent actions of the part excited by leeching, and discutient lotions, which answer better than blisters or ointments. If there is water in the tunica vaginalis, a com- plication named Hydro-Sarcocele, the fluid ouglit to be evac\i-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 452 ated by puncture before these local measures are instituted. When the swelling attains a large size, and resists a patient trial of the means that have been mentioned, it may be removed by the knife as a last resource, and of course with a favourable prognosis in regard to the prospect of permanent recovery. A section of the tumour removed in such cases generally exhibits a compact fibrous structure, which is usually of a yellow or yellowish-gray colour, and contains irregularly-sized cells iriter- sj)ersed through its substance. Gystic Sarcoma of the, Testicle. The testicle is liable to the formation of cysts in. its texture, and these sometimes occupy so much of it as to constitute a mass in which the cystic character predominates. Wlien this disease is associated with hydi-ocele or htematocele, its diagnosis cannot be made out with accuracy, until the fluid in the tunica vaginalis has been drawn off. The only remedy for this affection is re- moval, and the operation may be performed with less regret, as the glandular structure of the testicle always suffers such atrophy, or changes in. its texture, that it cannot be expected to perform its function. Medullary Sarcoma of the Testicle. Excepting the bones and the mamma, the testicle is perhaps more subject to the derangement of nutrition, which leads to this morbid growth, than any structure in the body. It is generally met with at and before the middle period of life ; sometimes commencing without any assignable cause, but not unfrequently being referred to blows, or bruises, or to inflammation excited by other means. The patient's appearance is generally healthy, and the diseased action shows less tendency to spread than when it occurs in other parts. The tumour merely enlarges, becoming very irregular and tuberous on the surface, and exhausts the patient by the irritation which the pain attending it occasions ; but the integuments and glands are extremely slow in acquiriug the morbid disposition, so that the operation of removal, which,GENITAL ORGANS. 453 of course, affords tlie only' means of relief, is performed even in very advanced cases witli a favourable prognosis. In the earlier stage of the growth, it is often found very difficult to determine positively, by external examination, whether the swelling is solid, or depends on the presence of fluid. The globular shape, tendency to tuberous projections of the surface, pain, and equality of consistence at all parts of the tumour, observed when it is solid, may generally render the discrimination precise ; but in cases of doubt, the truth can readily be discovered by making a pimcture, which can do no harm, if the patient is prepared to submit to extirpation of the testicle in the event of its proving necessary. The tumour, when divided, displays the characters peculiar to such degenerations, namely, a soft brain-lilce pulpy substance, irregularly partitioned by thin septa of cellular texture, and varying in colour from white to dark-red, according to the pro- poi-tion of blood which enters into the composition of the mass. Sibppuration and Fungus of the Testicle. Young men of scrofulous constitutions are liable to abscesses and sinuses of the testicle, which are apt to prove very obsti- nate, even when they are freely dilated by incision. It might seem in such cases that extirpation would be a simpler, much speedier, and hardly more injurious mode of relief, than thus laying open the structure of the gland by dividing it in various directions ; but if the cure is completed, very little trace of these incisions remains, and the organ may perhaps be still capable of performing its office. It occasionally happens after suppuration has taken place in the testicle, particularly when induced by the cachectic state caused by mercury and preceded by hardness, and the resulting matter has been discharged, that a fungous excrescence protrudes from the opening, presenting a very for- midable appearance, which formerly led to removal of the organ as affected with malignant disease. Mr. Lawrence pointed out the true nature of these j)roductions, and explained that they depended not upon the peculiarity of action, but on the pecu- liarity of structure, which, being soft and enclosed in a finnPRINCIPLES OF SURGEPvy. 454 capsule, tended to expand, when tlie coverings were perforated so as to permit its doing so. He ascertained that if the excres- cence were cut off or destroyed by caustic, the remaining surface granulated ; and, though it might repeatedly protrude again to a smaller extent, that ultimately, through a repetition of the same means, followed by pressure, it became completely cicatrized. As the fungus, from its constitution, admitted of being con- sidered similar to an extreme degree of exuberant granulation, it occurred to me that the disease might be induced by pressure to retrace its steps, and thus permit recovery without any loss of substance. For this purpose, nothing seemed so convenient as covering the growth with the scrotal integuments, which being freely separated by dissection from their subjacent connections, could be readily broiight over the tumour, so as to have their edges united by sutiu-es. This experiment proved eminently successful, and has been followed by results in the practice of others, as well as myself, which warrant me to recommend the operation as in every respect deserving of confidence. It may now, through the agency of chloroform, be performed without pain. It is much more speedy in effecting recovery than any other method, and it preserves instead of destroying the organ concerned. Extirpation of the Testicle. The mode of removing the testicle, whatever be the circum- stances requiring the operation, is to be conducted on the same principles, which may now be explained. The ]points of most importance in determining these are—1. The quantity of integu- ment to be left; 2. The suppression of the bleeding; and, 3. The dressing of the wound. Wlien the tumour is large and of rapid growth, the skin covering it is not only put very much upon the stretch, but also borrowed from that of the penis and the other testicle; conse- quently, if the whole of it were taken away, a very large exposed surface would remain. If, on the other hand, none of the integ\i- ments, or only a small portion of them, were removed, more especially in a case of slow and long-continued swelling, though455 GENITAL OEGANS. the corrugating effects of the contractility of the scrotum, excited by the iiiitation of the operation, might, in the first instance, make it appear that no inconvenience was likely to result, the redimdant integument would certainly, so soon as it became relaxed, afford an ample receptacle for the accumulation of blood or pus, and present a very extensive granulating surface, that must greatly prolong the cure. Keeping these different con- siderations in view, the sui-geon should endeavour to preserve merely enough of the integuments to allow the edges of the woimd to be brought together, without either straining or laxity. In regard to the hemorrhage, great apprehension has been enter- tained lest the cord should be retracted by the cremaster muscle, and the artery withdrawn beyond reach of the ligature. This has led to many coarse and dangerous expedients, such as tying the whole cord previou.s to its division, or including all its vessels together except the vas deferens. Violent pain, fever, inflammation, convulsions, and even death, were the conse- quences of this practice, which is now abandoned, the artery being tied alone ; but the fear of retraction stiU excites imeasi- ness during the operation. It, therefore, seems necessary to remark, that, as the cremaster muscle is attached very near the external ring, it cannot withdraw the cord except to a very small extent, and that, if the artery retires at all, it must do so in con- . sequence of its own elasticity. Eetraction on this account may be expected in proportion to the size of the tumour, the rapidity of its growth, and the nearness to the external ring, of the point at which the cord is divided. In no case, however, ■svill it be necessary to use any force in retaining the vessel, and the assistant may readily secure it either between the nails of his thimib and fore-finger, or with forceps. Besides the sper- matic artery, there are always several, and sometimes so many as seven or eight vessels coming from the groin and perineum, that require to be tied. Such being the principles to be followed in performing the operation, it may now be right to explain succinctly the mode of proceeding. The patient should be laid reclining on a table orPRINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY. 456 sofa, witli the tliiglis separated, and the hair of the pubis shaved off. The surgeon then, grasping the testicle in his left hand, makes two incisions, commencing at the external ring, and imiting at the bottom of the tumour. He next cuts down to the cord, where these incisions meet above, passes his finger under the vessels, and then desires the assistant to lay hold of them. He now divides the cord as low as is consistent with entire removal of the disease, and pulling the lower end of it towards him, turns out the testicle, which may be detached with a few strokes of the knife, while the penis and sound testicle are drawn aside. The spermatic artery, and any branches of the perineal or inguinal vessels that threaten to bleed, are then tied, and lint is applied to afford the requisite support. Sarcomatous Enlargement of the Serotuvi. The scrotum is liable to an enlargement, which seems to consist merely in a morbid growth of the cellular substance, with interstitial deposition of albuminous matter, so as to give it a very firm consistence. When exposed by a section, the struc- ture appears white, compact, and homogeneous, except where small cells containing glairy fluid are interspersed through it. The gTowth begins in the lower part of the scrotiun, but, as it proceeds, engages the whole of it, together with the skin of the penis, which becomes completely concealed from view. The prepuce is greatly elongated, and presents at its orifice a tuber- cu.lated cauliflower-looking excrescence, that does not bear the slightest resemblance to the part in its natural state. There are no limits to the size which such humours may attain. Twenty, forty, or even sixty pounds' weight is by no means uncommon ; and there is one case on record in which the mass when removed weighed 170 pounds. The disease generally commences in adults, and increases slowly during the remainder of Mfe. It is common in tropical countries, particularly in the "West Indies, but occurs comparatively seldom in the temperate climates of Europe. The only remedy for this oppressive growth, which impedesGENITAL ORGANS. 457 progressive motion, and occasions other serious inconveniences, consists ill its removal. This object has been attained without taking away the penis and testicles; but the former of these organs is so deeply imbedded in the substance of the tumour, and its texture is usually so vascular, that such a procedure cannot always be practicable. If an attempt is made to preserve the sexual parts, flaps of the integuments must be preserved of sufficient size to cover them. Should, on the contrary, the removal of the entire tumour be determined on, the incisions may be executed with great rapidity, which mode of conducting the operation is much safer than cutting slowly, with the view of securing the arteries as they are divided; for both the pain and hemorrhage are thus greatly increased, and the patient, instead of being relieved from his load in a few seconds, may be detained under the knife for hours. The labium of the female is occasionally the seat of a similar growth. It possesses the same structure, gives rise to similar inconvenience, and admits of no other remedy. Cancer of the Scrotum. Mr. Pott (1775) described a cancerous ulceration of the .scrotum, which he had frequently remarked in adult chimney- sweepers. Succeeding sui-geons have confirmed the accuracy of his observations, so far as London is concerned; but in Edin- burgli, and other parts of Scotland, this chimney-sweeper's cancer is hardly ever met with, except in persons who have begun to suffer from it elsewhere. The following is the description of Mr. Pott:—" It is a disease which always makes its first attack on, and its first appearance in, the inferior part of the scrotum, where it produces a superficial, paiaful, ragged, ill-looking sore, with hard and rising edges. The trade call it the soot wart. In no great length of time it pervades the sldn, dartos, and mem- branes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it enlarges, hardens, and renders truly and thoroughly distempered, from whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdo- men, most frequently indurating and spoiling tlie inguinal glands.458 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. "Wlien arrived witliin tlie abdomen, it affects some of the viscera, and tlien very soon becomes painfully destructive." The only remedy for this disease is removal of the cancerous part; and, unless the operation be performed before the morbid process has advanced far, it does not afford any chance of a per- manent cure. Diseases of the Female Organs of Generation. The vagina is sometimes more or less completely obstructed by a membrane at its orifice, wliicli opposes the exit of the menstrual discharge. The non-appearance of the menses at the usual period of life, or the symptoms connected with their reten- tion, should always lead to an inquiry respecting the conforma- tion of the parts, and if such a congenital imperfection as the one just mentioned is discovered, the patient may be completely relieved by a very simple operation; all that is necessary being to divide the membrane with a kaife or scissors, and inteipose a piece of lint between its cut edges. The vagina, in some rare cases, has been found altogether wanting for part of its extent, in which cases, of course, nothing can be done in the way of. remedy. The Uterus is subject to the development in its substance of simple sarcomatous tumours of a very firm fibrous structure, which often grow from different parts of the organ at the same time, and, though generally not exceeding the size of an egg, are sometimes so large as to distend the abdomen far beyond the limits of an ordinary pregnancy. Iodine and other medicines are prescribed, both locally and internally, with the view of promoting the discussion of such growths; but it is probable that nothing can have any beneficial effect upon their progress except attention to the mode of life, which should be of a kind calculated to excite as little as possible the system in general, and the uterus in particular. Cancer of the uterus occurs occasionally, but is fortunately not frequent, since the situation and connections of the parts affected prevent the only effectual remedy for carcinomatousGENITAL OKGANS. 459 disease from being put in practice, without inflicting a mortal injury. A few cases are recorded in which the uterus is said to have been extii-pated when previously prolapsed beyond the ori- fice of the vagina, and permanently retained in this situation by the adhesions resulting from inflammation. It is only in such circumstances that the operation ought ever to be contemplated, and even here it must be regarded as affording a very small chance of success, so that, unless the patient's sufferings are very great, and threaten to" terminate fatally soon, it coidd hardly be recommended with propriety, y The uterus may be extirpated more safely, when it is in the state named Inversion by accoucheurs. It is in this case turned inside out, so as to form a round or pjrriform tumour, either con- fined to the vagina, or protruded beyond the vulva. When this eversion, which generally takes place at the time of delivery, is not immediately remedied, it is apt to become irreducible ; and the patient suffers many disagreeable symptoms from the un- natural condition of the organ, especially frequent hemorrhage, down-bearing pains, and general weakness. In cases that resist more gentle means, the tumour may be removed by ligature, which should be of strong twine or silk; and either applied simply roimd its neck, or carried through the middle of it double by means of a needle, one of the threads being then tied on each side. If disagreeable effects ensue, opiate injections into the rectum, and the hip-bath, will be the most efficient measures for affording relief Polypous excrescences frequently grow from the inner surface of the uterus, and either remain confined to its cavity, or descend into the vagina, sometimes even protruding externally. These tumours have a pyiifonn shape, and a firm consistence. They possess little sensibility, but much vascularity, and occasion many unpleasant symptoms, such as bloody and mucous dis- charges, pain in the back, weakness, emaciation, and general bad health. Tliey cannot be either positively recognised, or removed, unless they extend below the os %tcri, or have access afforded to them by dilatation of the oiifice. If they cannot be broughtPIIINCIPLES or SURGERY. 4G0 I into view, the best mode of removing them is to tie a strong ligature as close as possible to their root. This is executed much more easily by means of the fingers, than any of the apparatus contrived for the purpose. They may also be removed by evul- sion. When the neck of the excrescence can be pulled beyond the orifice of the vagina, the simplest and speediest mode of proceeding is to transfix it with a needle, and carry thi'ough two threads, wMch are then tightly tied, one on each side, after which the tumour may be removed by the knife. There is often considerable dif&culty in distinguishing growths of tliis kind from eversion of the uterus. Their history, deficient sensibility, and their having round their root a ring formed by the os uteri, in general afford sufficient diagnostics on a careful examination. Excrescences frequently grow from one or both lips of the OS uteri; and by bleeding, or exciting the usual symptoms of uterine irritation, occasion great distress. It has been found by Lisfranc, and other French surgeons, that their excision may be performed without any bad consequences, and with the best effects, even when they have attained a very large size. The in- struments employed for the purpose consist of hooked forceps to draw the morbid growth into view, and curved scissors or a bis- toury to cut it away. The hemorrhage may generally be restrained by cold applications and plugging the vagina with lint or sponge; but if it should prove excessive, the' cut surface must be again drawn out and compressed, by transfixing it with a couple of threads, and tying one on each side. The Ovaries are liable to various morbid conditions, but par- ticularly two, which often become the subject of surgical con- sideration. Of these, the first that may be mentioned consists in the development of cysts in their substance, which is thus con- verted into a cystic tumour. The swelling is at first felt round, firm, and movable in the inguinal region. It gradually increases, not owing to an equal enlargement of all the cysts, but an exten- sion of one or more of them. The cavity of the abdomen is dis- tended, and at length appears as if the peritoneum were the seat of dropsical effusion. The progress of the disease is very vari-4G1 GENITAL ORGANS. able; sometimes proceeding rapidly to the extinction of life, by- pressing to a fatal degree on tlie vital organs of the abdomen or chest, but more frequently allowing years to elapse before coming to tliis termination. The disease commences most frequently in young females, but is met with at all periods of life. It is dis- tinguished in its advanced stage from ascites, chiefly by the his- tory of the case. The treatment by paracentesis of Ovarian Dropsy, as this affection is called, proves still less satisfactory than that of dropsy of the peritoneum, which will not excite surprise, when it is recollected that the diseased action in the latter case is simply an increased secretion, while in the former it is a new and pecu- liar formation. Purgatives, diuretics, and all other means em- ployed to promote absorption of the accumulated fluid, almost invariably prove quite unavailing; and paracentesis, though it affords some temporary relief, seems in general to hasten the progress of the disease. The operation, therefore, ought not to be performed, except when the patient is suffering great distress. Various methods of effecting a radical cure have been proposed. Of these the chief are, throwing injections into the sac, intro- ducing a seton through it, and drawing it out of the abdomen by an aperture in the parietes. The one last mentioned, though apparently the most severe, on the whole seem.s to be the most expedient in cases warranting such interference. The Ovaries are siibject to enlargements of a solid land, which not only occasion inconvenience by their size and weight, but are generally the seat of painful sensations. The structure of these tumours is generally of a complicated kind, displaying, when exposed by a section, the characters of vascular, fibrous, and cystic sarcoma, in variable proportion and distinctness. The disease is sometimes rapid in its progress, but usually slow, and often exists for years before giving much trouble. After attain- ing a certain extent, it sometimes remains stationary, and the patient becoming habituated to its presence, suffers compara- tively little inconvenience. Iodine, leeches, and other means calculated to promote absoi-ption or allay irritation, are employed462 PEINeiPLES OF SURGERY. in such cases, but with hardly any perceptible advantage ; and all that can be done by external measures, whether local or general, seems to be to retard the morbid process through the effect of diet and regimen. Excitement of every kind ought to be avoided ; the secretions ought to be carefully maintained; and if any local means are used, .they ought to be of a soothiug kind, such as warm fomentations. The inefficacy of medicine in remedying tumours of the ovaries has led to the trial of surgical operations for their removal. The objections to such a proposal are—1. The uncertainty that must always attend the diagnosis of the disease, which is often very closely simulated by distension of the bowels, thickening of the omentum, enlargement of the liver, and growths from the uterus; 2. The impossibility of ascertaining, before the abdomen is laid open, whether or no the connections of the tumour allow of its removal without the iafliction of a mortal wound; 3. The danger of the operation even in the most favourable cu'cumstances ; and, 4. The difficulty of knowing how long the patient may live if the disease is not interfered with. Notwithstanding these serious obstacles to ovariotomy, and although until comparatively a recent period experience confirmed the worst anticipation of its effects, the operation has now become established in practice. The greater success which has led to this result apjpears attri- butable chiefly to—1. The more accurate discrimination of cases; 2. The use of silver sutures ; 3. The care taken to prevent san- guineous or cystic effusion into the cavity of the peritoneum ; and, 4. The management of the pedicle, especially by attaching it to the lips of the wound.BRAIN. ^ 463 CHAPTEE XX. BRAIN, SPINAL MAEROW, AND NERVES. Injuries of the Brain and its Coverings. Concussion, or a violent shock, may act injuriously both on the brain and the parts which enclose it, either separately or together. It occasions at one time rupture or laceration, and at another merely disturbance in the vital action. In both cases it is apt to excite inflammation, and then, besides its primary effects, produces very important secondary ones. Concussion of the brain is caused by blows on the head, or by falling in such a position as prevents the force of the shock from being diffused over a number of intermediate articulations, before reaching the head. The effect of blows on the head in pro- ducing concussion is proportioned to their force, the flatness of the surface applied to the skull, and the resistance it makes. The symptoms of the injury vary with the degree of it. If there is no laceration of the cerebral substance or membranes, the patient merely suffers a temporary diminution or suspension of the functions of the organ. In very slight cases, there is confu- sion of ideas, and weakness of the voluntary muscles, which last only a few minutes.- Wlien the shock has been more severe, the patient is quite insensible; his pulse is small and irregular ; his breathing is slow and feeble; his pupils are fixed, generally in a contracted, but sometimes dilated state, and there is occasional vomiting. This condition seldom lasts beyond ten, or at the most twenty minutes, and is succeeded by a return to health, which either continues, or terminates in inflammation. "When the con- cussion has caused laceration of the cerebral substance, tlie insensibility is of longer duration; and when at the end of464 PRINCIPLES OP SUEGEKY. some liours, or it may be a day or more, the patient begins to give signs of returning consciousness, lie recovers very imperfectly, and only for a sliort interval before inflammation commences. In such cases, death often occurs within a few hours, or even a shorter period, after the accident, and before any signs of recovery from the insensible state can be perceived. The treatment of concussion may be conveniently considered, in reference to the three stages of the consequences of the injury which have been mentioned, namely, that of the concussion pro- perly—that of recovery—and that of inflammation. Diu'iug the first of these, little or nothing ought to be done, except putting the patient to bed, and applying some source of artificial heat to his feet if necessary. Bleeding would be decidedly improper; and the exhibition of internal stimulants, though it might hasten the recovery of sensibility, might also increase the violence of subsequent reaction. Unless, therefore, the signs of debihty in the vital actions should be alarming, the patient may be trusted entirely to the powers of his constitution. The second stage, or return of sensibility, requires more atten- tion, since the treatment during this stage greatly influences the succeeding one. The patient is apt to suppose himself quite well, and to have fortunately made a very easy escape from the effects of his accident; but were he, in accordance with this belief, to expose himself to cold, or subject himself to the excitement of exercise or stimulating food and drink, he would increase the risk of inflammation, and aggravate its intensity beyond that which would otherwise have resulted from the injury. He ought, therefore, to be confined to the house, or to bed if the case is severe, and restricted to the most scrupulous antiphlogistic regi- men for a few days. So far as the brain is directly concerned, he might safely resume his usual habits after this period of probation, but its coverings being apt to suifer, or perhaps, more correctly, to shew signs of the suffering at a more distant date, in conse- quence of the injury they have undergone, as will be explained hereafter, he should for several weeks at least be very abstinent, if the blow has been at all severe. The restoration of the sen-BRAIN. 405 sorial faculties is sometimes only partial, and the patient then remains permanently defective in respect to some of them, particularly memory. Sometimes also the character or disposi- tion of the individual is observed to be changed. The symptoms of inflammation of the brain generally appear within from twelve to twenty-four hours after the injury has been sustained. The pulse becomes quickened and sharp in its stroke; the skin feels hot and dry; the patient is restless, complains of headache, and is unusually sensible to light and noise. If the disease proceeds, the indications of it just mentioned become more strongly marked. Delirium and spasmodic contractions of the muscles come on, and are soon succeeded by insensibility and palsy of the limbs, and death closes the scene in the course of a few days at farthest. On dissection, the brain or membranes are found very vascular, with purulent effusion on the surface of the latter, and softening of the substance of the former. In cases where the texture of the brain has been lacerated in the first instance, the state of insensibility and collapse which immediately follows the accident, after a period of variable length, from a few hours to twenty-four, gradually passes into that of inflammation, generally with the intervention of an imperfect return of sense and voluntary motion, which is apt to suggest delusive hopes of improvement. The patient expresses pain by restlessness and moaning, his limbs are rigid or convulsed, and in a short time he passes into the same condition as if the inflammation had origi- nated from mere derangement of action, and not alteration of structure. On dissection, the cerebral substance at the injured part is found softened, and seeming as if mixed with blood and pus. In treating all inflammatory attacks, it is of the utmost conse- quence to employ the remedial measures as early as possible, and in none is it more necessary to do so tlian in this. Free general depletion, followed up by cupping on the neck, powerful cathartics and injections, shaving the head, and applying cold to it, are the means to be chiefly trusted for breaking the strength of the dis- order. By leeching the temples, and keeping up a copious 2 n466 PKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. secreting action of the bowels, the remaining symptoms are in general removed, if the other more efficient measures prove suc- cessful in subduing the force of the disease. Sometimes the inflammation assumes a chronic form, which, though not attended with much immediate danger, is very distressing, and may lead to permanent affections of a very unpleasant kind. In this case the patient's pulse does not descend to the natural standard, but continues small and frequent; his tongue displays a yellowish- white fur, his skin is hot and dry, he has no aj^petite, his sleep is disturbed, he complains of headache, his complexion is sallow, and the expression of his countenance indicative of anxiety. Free purgation, and blistering of the head, are the best means of counteractiag the morbid condition which gives rise to these symptoms, and which, if permitted to go on, may occasion thick? ening of the membranes, or disorganization of the brain, attended with epilepsy, fatuity, and ultimately with death. It appears that the dura and pia mater may also suffer from concussion, since they sometimes inflame, and produce peculiar symptoms in cases where the head has been subjected to vio- lence, that can act only in this way. Blows which expose the bone are the most common sources of such effects, and frequently give rise to them, though of inconsiderable violence. The patient, after a little confusion or stupor, may feel quite wqII, and follow his ordinary pursuits for several days, at the end of which, generally from the seventh to the eleventh, he begins to shew some indication of the disease that is going on within his head. The pulse becomes frequent and wiry; his tongue is furred; his countenance anxious; his sleep broken; and he feels a general uneasiness, with indisposition for all active exertion, whether of body or mind. Headache, with intolerance of light and noise, then succeeds, with occasional rigors ; but delirium and convul- sions are more slow of appearing than when the cerebral sub- stance is the seat of inflammation. At length these symptoms present themselves, and are speedily followed by insensibility, involuntary discharges from the bowels, and death. On dissec- tion, an effusion of pus is generally foimd occupying a more or4G7 BRAIN. less extensive portion of the surface of the dura mater, which is separated from the bone, and altered both in colour and consis- tence, or the subjacent pia mater and substance of the brain. As the approach of this disorder is slow and insidious, while the means of checking it can be used with effect only in the com- mencement of its progress, all injuries of the head that can possibly give rise to it ought to be treated with care. The patient should for weeks abstain from every kind of excitement, and endeavour to preserve his secretions in the most healthy state. Quickness of the pulse, and headache, suggest free venesection, with the internal administration of tartrate of antimony, either alone or combined with the saline cathartics. If repeated rigors succeed signs of inflammation, and especially if the patient becomes insensible, it may be presumed that pus has been effused ; and the only chance of his recovery is afforded by perforating the cranium, so as to give the matter free vent, if it is lodged betAveen the bone and the dura mater. If not found there it may exist deeper, but incisions in search of it would be quite unwarrantable. PuiBness of the scalp, and a glassy dry appearance of the wound, if there be one, have been insisted upon as important indications of suppuration of the dura mater; but they often exist in cases where there is nothing of the kind, and, therefore, ought not to be confided in. The operation of perforating the skull is performed in this country with a Trephine or circular saw, to which the necessary rotatory motion is given by the hand. On the continent, an older instrument named the Trepan, which works like a carpenter's brace, is still in use; and it is difficult to understand how the latter should ever have given place to the former, the use of which renders the process much more tedious and laborious. The only objection that can be alleged against the trepan is, the risk of its injuring the dura mater or brain ; but the apprehen- sion of this rests entirely on theoretical grounds, as with mode- rate care any chance of such an occurrence may be prevented. The patient should be laid on a support, low enough to render it unnecessary for the operator to elevate his arms in working468 PEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. the saw. If the bone is not sufficiently exposed by the original injury, a crucial or triangular incision must be made through the scalp, the flaps of which are then to be dissected back. The pericranium is next scraped off sufficiently to prevent it. from impeding the teeth of the saw, which is applied at first with its centre pin protruded to keep it steady, and afterwards, when a groove has been formed, this obstacle to its progress is removed. The sawing must be conducted cautiously, as the skull is not always equally thick, and is often throughout very thin, with hardly any perceptible diploe. A tooth-pick, or probe, should be introduced from time to time, to ascertain whether or no the bone is perforated at any part of the circle; and when the whole seems to be nearly cut through, a levator or forceps may be employed to raise the detached piece. If circumstances appear to require the removal of more bone, the same means are to be repeated,—or tlie process may be accelerated, if the poi-tion is extensive, by Key's saw, as it is usually called, which proves convenient for connecting the circular apertures together so as to separate at once a large portion of the cranium. After the operation the wound is to be lightly dressed, and the general treatment conducted with the view of checking any tendency to inflammatory action. Cases admitting of this operation with any prospect of success are extremely rare, as the suppuration generally extends over a large surface of the membranes, or engages the substance of the brain, and I never knew an instance of its successful performance. Compression of the brain, when a consequence of external violence, is directly caused either by effusion of blood or by depression of the skull. In both cases the symptoms are the same, and denote suspension of the cerebral functions, more or less complete. The patient lies as if in a profound sleep; his breathing is stertorous ; his pulse slow and labouring; his pupils immovable, and in general dilated. He groans occasionally, winces under pressure applied to the injured part of his head, and frequently raises his hand to it. This state may continue, without suffering any material change, for a period of indefinite4G9 BEAIN. length, from hours to weeks, or even months; but generally terminates in the course of a few days at farthest, either in a return to health, or in inflammation. Effusion of blood may take place between the skull and dura mater, on the surface of the brain, and into its substance. In all of these situations it depends on rupture of the vessels from concussion; and, there- fore, the symptoms of that kind of injury are at first generally associated with those of compression. As the symptoms of con- cussion, however, always go off soon, unless the brain has been lacerated, it may be concluded, if the patient remains insensible beyond an hour or two, that there is either an effusion of blood, or rupture of the cerebral substance. The latter case may be, in general, distinguished by the more complete insensibility, and other indications of suspended function which attend it, and by the early appearance of inflammatory symptoms. It seems that the effusion does not always occur immediately after i the injury is sustained, but sometimes takes place gxadually, so that there may be either no insensibility observable for a short period after the blow is inflicted, or an interval between the in- sensibility caused by concussion and that resulting from com- pression. In this case there can be no doubt as to compression being the cause of the symptoms. The quantity of blood effused is seldom gi'eat, but may amount to several ounces. Between the skull and dura mater it usually takes the form of a cake, of Hmited extent; on the surface of the brain it constitutes a thin crust or lining, widely spread over it; and in the substance of the organ it is generally coagulated at the centre of the injured part, and diffused, in the form of ecchymosed spots, into the neighbourhood. The largest accumulations of blood are met with between the dura mater and the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, where it seems to be effused from the menin- geal artery. The extravasation, in general, takes place either immediately under the part subjected to violence, or on the side of the head ojjposite to it. Depression of the cranium happens more readily in young than in old subjects ; but produces less inconvenience in thePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 470 former than the latter, owing to the yielding condition of the bones at their time of life, which allows the cavity, when dimi- nished at one part, to expand in another. Where a perceptible depression exists, the symptoms may be fairly referred to the compression thus caused; since, when the case is broken, it is not likely that the contents should be so much shaken as when it remains entire. It was formerly thought that the symptoms of compression peremptorily required the immediate performance of an opera- tion for raising the depressed portion of the skull, or affording vent to effused blood. The ample experience of a different practice, followed in modern surgery, has proved that in most cases, imless the substance of the brain has suffered serious in- jury from concussion, the condition of the patient labouring under compression will not be altered for the worse, and in many will amend, if some days are allowed to elapse after the injury has been sustained, before proceeding to trepan the skull. The salutary change depends, no doubt, partly upon the effects of absorption,—partly upon the brain becoming accommodated to the diminished size of its containing case; and it will be promoted by bleeding, active cathartics, and powerful injections thrown into the rectum. If the symptoms do not diminish, or if they increase, the operation must be performed; and the proper time for determining on it is regulated by the particular features of the case. Should depression of the skuU. be asso- ciated with a wound of the scalp, penetrating to the bone, a very short trial of the means calculated to supersede the necessity of an operation wUl be sufficient, as the fracture is already a com- pound one, and consequently not liable to be aggravated in this important respect by trepauing. On other occasions, two or three days may generally be allowed to pass without any bad consequences. In operating for depression of the cranium, the saw should be applied on the sound part, so as to remove the overlapping edge that prevents the broken portion from being raised into its place by a levator, or taken away altogether. If the blood effused is found under the dura maicr, which then471 BRAIN, appears unusually tense, and presents a bluish appearance, an opening ought not to be made through the membrane, since there is great danger in cutting into the cavity of the arachnoid, and little advantage is to be expected from doing so, as the blood in such a case is spread over an extensive surface, and the brain is in some measure relieved from pressure by the aperture that has been formed in the bone. Fractures of the cranium would be of very little consequence, were it not on account of their connection with injury of the organs which it contains. In reference to this, they may be conveniently divided into Fissures, Depressions, and Punctures. A Fissure, as the name implies, is merely a solution of con- tinuity in the bone, without any material displacement of the edges of the fracture. It is caused by diffused force acting directly, or transmitted to a distant part of the cranium by the intermediate portion remaining entire, and conducting it where the strength is less able to resist. The base of the cranium is generally the part broken in the latter way, or by contre-coup, as it is called; and the fissure usually extends through the Gu^a©^:3 process of the occipital bone, transversely or obliquely backwards. Bleeding from the ear often accompanies, though it • does not necessarily proceed from, a fissure of tliis kind. Fis- sures, as might be expected from the mode of their production, are in general followed either by sjjeedy death, or by violent in- flammation of the cerebral substance and membranes. These bad consequences were attributed by the old surgeons to the split of the bone allowing noxious transudations from without inwards, and their practice consisted in sawing away with the trepan, as far as they possibly could, all traces of the injured bone. In the more sound pathology of the present day, fissiires are regarded as quite innocent so far as regards their own effects, —but as affording ground of unfavourable prognosis, by shewing that the skull has been subjected to a great degree of concus- sion. They are, however, seldom known to exist until after death, since no one now thinks of searching for them, as was the custom formerly.472 PRINCIPLES OP SURGEPiY. Fractm-es witli depression result from the operation of forces acting on a somewhat extensive surface which gives way before them. The contents of the cranium are consequently not niuch shaken ; and as the depressed portion presents its smooth side to the membranes, there is 'comparatively little risk of inflam- mation being excited in them. It has been abeady explained, in regard to compression, that it is not considered right in modern siu'geiy to interfere by operation with such fractui-es, unless the symptoms denoting compression of the brain should be well marked, and persist after a modera-fce period, during which proper measures are employed for promoting the accom- modation of the organ to the alteration that has taken place in the shape and size of its containing case. Pimctured fractures are inflicted by sharp-pointed bodies, which apply their force with concentrated effect. They per- forate, or beat in, a small portion of the external table of the skull, which, acting on the more brittle, internal, or vitreous ! part, generally depresses it to a considerably gi-eater extent, in the form of a flattened cone, the apex of which corresponds with ' I the centre of the injuxy. The sharp edges and points of bone thus driven inwards are apt to lacerate the membranes, or at aU events irritate them, so as to excite inflammation. Sometimes the bad effects thus produced are of a chronic kind, and the patient, months or years after the injury has been sustained, may suffer from pain, discharge, or epilepsy, caused by the iiiita- tion of a scale of bone pressing on the dura mater or brain. In the first instance, this injury is attended with little incon- venience, since the skull being broken, there is little concussion, and no internal effusion of blood, while the extent of bone depressed, though it may be considerable when comjDared with the size of the external wound, is not so great as to occasion any sensible degree of comjpression. But no fractm-e is really so dangerous, or so much entitled to attention on its own account, and it ought always to be regarded as requiring an immediate ojjeration. In performing tliis, it is rarely necessary to convert a simple fracture into a compound one, as the bone is in almost473 BKAJN. every case exposed by the blow that caused the injury. In general the apertiu-e is large enough to allow the broken pieces to be picked out; but sometimes it is necessary for this purpose to remove a circular portion by means of the trephine. In this case the centre pin of the instrument should be fixed at the margin of the opening, as near as possible to the middle of the injured part. After the operation, the patient must be protected from all sources of excitement, and freely depleted, if threaten- ings of inflammation appear. "VYounds of the brain, unless very deep or extensive, are not immediately attended with any remarkable indications of the injury, except what may be presented to view by the part itseK. The patient often walks, speaks, and conducts himself in other respects, as if not materially hurt. Inflammation almost inevit- ably, however, soon comes on, and proving no less intense than imcontrollable, usually terminates fatally in the course of a day or two. The treatment ought to be directed with the view of preventing and checking these bad consequences, but will seldom be productive of much benefit, and therefore the prognosis in such cases is very unfavourable. Hernia cerebri is a protrusion that frequently occurs, when . the dura mater has been exposed or injured in consequence of external violence. The membrane becomes prominent, dis- coloured, soft, and at length perforated by a small aperture, which enlarging, allows a fungous excrescence to expand itself. Tliis growth is found on dissection to consist of a bloody mass, in which some traces of the cerebral substance can be discerned, and seems to resemble in constitution the fungus of the testicle that has been described above. It probably depends upon the brain having been injured by the concussion proceeding from the blow which caused the injury, and suffering in succession ecchymosis, inflammation, and suppuration, wliich, extending to the dura mater, effects its perforation, and permits the soft sub- stance of the brain to escape from the pressure that it sustains within tlie cranium, mixed with coagulated blood effused into its interstices, so as to present the appearance of a solid tumour.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 474 The treatment of Jwnia cerebri wMcli proves most beneficial I consists in the free excision of the protruded mass on a level j with the surface of the du7-a mater, and the subsequent appli- I cation of pressure by means of lint, together with a plate of lead suited to the size of the aperture in the bone. With the assist- ance of such means the patient sometimes recovers, but more frequently sinks under the irritation attending the disease. The scalp is liable to various injimes, of which the first that may be mentioned are Bruises. The most common effect of these is the appearance of a firm round flat tumour, owing to effusion into the cellular substance, wliich takes place almost immediately after the blow is inflicted, and then gradually diminishes without any remedial measures, so as to leave, in the course of a few days, no trace of its existence. "When the con- tusion is more severe, blood is effused under the iutegiimeuts, so as to constitute a fluctuating swelling, the extent of which is very variable, from that of the point of a finger to a half or more of the surface of the cranium. The edges of the scalp surround- ing it are very firm, and somewhat thickened, whence there is some risk of erroneously supj)osing, from a careless examination, that the skuU is depressed. The blood is usually absorbed either spontaneously, or under the influence of a discutieut lotion, assisted by pressure, but occasionally excites sufficient irritation by its presence to cause the formation of an abscess. Should this change occur, a free opening must be made for the escape of the matter; and, if the quantity of fluid effused in the first instance is very large, or does not soon shew signs of being absorbed, it may be well, in order to hasten the cure and prevent suppuration, to evacuate the cavity of its contents, and then carefully press its sides together. In some rare cases, one or more of the larger arterial branches are ruptured, and the tumour then not only fluctuates, but pulsates. External pressure is found quite inelfectual in checking the accumidation when proceeding from this source, and the only method of remedying it consists in laying open the cavity, sponging out the blood, and securing the injured vessels by ligature, or the application of475 BllALN. compresses on their orifices. Bruises of tlie scalp, though perhaps apparently very trivial, are sometimes followed, at a distant date after the accident, by very disagreeable symptoms, denoting chronic inflammation of the pericranium, or dura mater. In such cases there are usually indications of constitutional derangement previous to the accident, and means proper for correcting this general disorder may be sufficient to remove the local complaint. But if the patient, after being subjected to an alterative course of diet and medicines, still suffers from pain- ful sensations of the scalp, aggravated by pressure on the injured part, from headache and sickness, or from perversion of any fimction connected with the cerebral organs, a_firucial incision ought to be made down to the bone, and be-prevented from heaUng until it is closed by the contraction of the granulating- process. Wounds of the scalp are to be treated in accordance with the general principles that have been explained. The neighbouring hairs should be always shaven clean away, and those more distant cut short to prevent them from insinuating themselves between the edges of the sore, collecting blood or other matters discharged from it, or impeding the application of dressings. If the scalp is detached from the bone in the form of a fiap, it ought not to be cut away, as was done previously to the time of Mr. Pott, who shewed the advantage of allowing nature to determine how far the part was rendered incapable of recovery* No inconvenience arises from replacing the flap in the first instance ; and if even a portion only of it should be saved, the cure wiU be greatly accelerated. When sand or other impurities are lodged in the wound, it must be carefully washed; and if this proves insufficient, a poultice may be applied until the surface is freed from all foreign matters. All wounds of the scalp, but especially those of a pimctiired form, are apt to occasion extensive inflammation of the neighbouring integu- ments. . It would not be proper, by way of pveventmg this, to make any incisions in the first instance ; but if the bad conse- quences in question shoidd ensue, free dilatation, together with476 PEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. warm fomentations and ponltiqes, ought to be employed without delay, while the general treatment of the patient is conducted so as to conduce to the soothing effect desired. Diseases of flie Coverings and Contents of the Cranium. Encysted tumours occur very frequently under the integu- ments of the scalp. They generally consist of a very thick and firm cyst, which contains a mixture of fluid and pultaceous matter. They vary in size from that of a walnut downwards, and unless subjected to pressure or ulcerated, are very loosely connected, so that when a knife is thrust through the integu- ments and cyst in its long direction, the latter may be readily pulled away with the forceps, or turned out with the handle of the laiife. Tumours of this sort are not unfrequently observed to be hereditary. More rarely, cysts of a thinner texture, and containing lardy-looldng matter, generally intermixed withTiairs, are met with in the scalj), chiefly at its lower and back part, near the neck These adhere more firmly, and require to be dissected out. They often attain a very considerable size. The only disease of the contents of the cranium, not depend- ing on external injury, that has ever been subjected to surgical treatment, is Hydrocephalus, or a morbid accumulation of fluid. The fluid is generally enclosed in the ventricles, but sometimes lies exterior to the surface of the brain, which is then usually more or less malformed. The disease is either acute or chronic : in the former case occuiiing suddenly as a consequence of in- flammatory action; and in the latter commencing insidiously without any such antecedent symptoms. Acute Hydrocephalus may take place at any period of life, but is most common in children. The quantity of fluid seldom exceeds an ounce or two, and death is caused probably not more by the pressure of the water than by the destruction of the cerebral substance occasioned by the inflammation which attends the effusion. The chronic form of the disease always commences in cluldhood, and is not unfrequently congenital. The accumulation of fluid slowly" increases, and the bones of the cranium not being united,477 BRAIN. are separated by stretching of their connecting membranes, so as to allow the quantity at length to weigh several xDounds, without much interfering with the functions of the brain, which becomes expanded into a bag-like form, and loses all trace of convolu- tions except on its inferior surface. The patient in such cases has the power of locomotion diminished, and his body becomes excessively attenuated ; but existence is often prolonged for many years, and may at length terminate in a way not connected with the disease of the brain. The great object in treating acute hydrocephalus is to subdue the primary inflammation, since the case is nearly hopeless when effusion takes place. It is evident that the mere removal of the effused fluid by operation, though it might for a little diminish the symptoms of pressure on the brain, could not afford any per- manent advantage, and the operation for this purpose would necessarily be attended with the danger that attends all wounds of the cerebral substance. Few attempts have accordingly been made to cure the disease by puncture, and the results of these confirm the imfavourable opinion of the practice that was pre- viously entertained on theoretical grounds. In Chronic Hydrocephalus, the accximulation of fluid consti- tutes the whole of the morbid condition, and consequently eva- cuation of it may not appear an unreasonable mode of affording relief. The operation has, accordingly, been frequently performed, but not with such success as affords any encouragement to repeat it. This win not appear surprising, if it is recollected that, in all other dropsical swellings, paracentesis hardly ever affords more than temporary relief, and that, in the particular case under con- sideration, there are circumstances peculiarly opposed to a more permanent recovery. The imyielding nature of the parietes of the cranium, even thougli at some parts remaining in a mem- branous state, must equally prevent the comjilete removal of the fluid, and the employment of effectual compression afterwards to oppose its reproduction. No great risk seems to be incurred, in the first instance, since the wounds made by introducing tlie trocar have generally healed without producing any bad conse-478 PRINCIPLES OF BUEGERY. quences, which may perhaps be accounted for by the thin ex- panded state of the cerebral substance, but the progress of the case is usually accelerated rather than checked. Injuries and Diseases of the Spinal Canal and its Contents. The spinal cord is Kable to concussion from blows and falls, particularly the latter, the symptoms of which are similar to those of concussion of the brain, inasmuch as they denote sus- pension of the functions usually exercised by this part of the nervous system. As these consist chiefly in conduction of the impressions producing sensation and voluntary motion, the patient loses more or less completely the feeling and power of moving in all the portion of the body which is supplied with nerves originating from the spinal cord, below the part where it lias suffered from the external violence. The organ does not recover from this state of inaction so soon as the brain,—a day or two at least almost always elapsing before any well-marked sign of improvement is perceptible. It is probable that the cause of this may be a complication with effusion of serum, or blood, occurring in consequence of the injury, which, subse- quently undergoing absorption, allows the usual actions to be restored. In cases of this kind the treatment, ia the first instance, should consist merely of rest, and, if necessary, introducing the catheter to draw off the urine. The patient, though insensible to external stimuli, generally complains of uneasy feelings, sometimes amounting to intense pain, in the paralyzed part of his body ; and if the state of his pulse, or other symptoms, such as flushing of the face, tenderness of the back to pressure, etc., should indicate the commencement of inflammation, general and local bleeding, warm fomentations, and purgative injections, must be assiduously employed to arrest the morbid process. After the acute symptoms have been subdued, and also in cases where the injury has not been primarily followed by them, the patient sometimes makes very slow progress in regaining the powers he has lost. Counter-irritation by blistering, tartrate ofBRAIN. 479 antimony ointment, or the actual cautery, then often proves ex- tremely useful; while warm bathing, with friction, and attempts at exercise, are diligently used to excite the languid energies of the limbs. The vertebrae are liable to dislocation and fracture, but never suffer in either of these ways without the operation of extreme violence, except in the cervical region, where the parts con- cerned are least firmly constructed, and sometimes suffer dis- placement from a degree of force not so very great. Dislocation seldom occurs unaccompanied by fracture; and the medullary cord is almost always much injured at the time, independently of the pressure apt to be permanently caused on it by the dis- jointed or broken vertebrae. The symptoms resulting from such injuries are nearly the same as those of simple concussion or compression, and the distiiiction between them depends on the former being generally more severe, as well as obstinate, but chiefly in the alteration of shape which is discovered in the spinal column. It has been stated that dislocation of the spine always terminates fatally, either in the first instance, or in the course of a few months, owing to the chronic inflammation, and alteration of structure occasioned by the injury ; but this is not altogether correct, since recoveries in such circumstances do take •place, though certainly very rarely. The prognosis, therefore, must be unfavourable. The treatment does not admit of replacement of the dislo- cated surfaces through the agency of external means, and the removal of portions of bone by operation to facilitate reduction, though it has been attempted, offers no reasonable prospect of benefiting the patient, while it must increase the danger of bad consequences by adding to the irritation. The vertebral canal is so much wider than the nervous cord which it contains, that a mere alteration of its direction, even though pretty acute, could hardly produce any very important effect on the functions of the organ; and if the displacement were so great as to make the bones press injuriously upon it, there is every reason to suppose, that taking away the portions of vertebrte concerned, even grant-480 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. ing it could be done witliout mischief, would be of no use in remedying the derangement of the structure of the cord. The patient, therefore, should be treated as if he had merely suffered concussion or compression. Symptoms of inflammation should be checked—the discharges from the rectum and bladder duly maintained—and if the immediate danger is surmounted, the means proper for subduing chronic disease at the injured part, should it be required, or for rousing the energies of the limbs, in case they remain defective in their power, must be carefully employed. The only disease of the spinal marrow, that affords subject of surgical practice, is that sort of Spina Bifida in which the ner- vous parts are perfectly formed, but the membranes are dis- tended with fluid so as to protrude through the aperture of the spine, and constitute an external tumour. The integuments at \; the part, which is usually the lumbar or sacral region, are gene- rally thin, livid, and adherent This disease is often associated with other congenital malformations, adverse to the duration of life, but when existing by itself, is not necessarily fatal. The thin parietes of the tumour sometimes ulcerate, so as to form a minute orifice, which, opening from time to time, allows the fluid to escape, and thus at length completes the cure. In imitation of this natural process, small punctures have been made with a needle (Sir A. Cooper), pressure being afterwards xarefull)'- exer- cised, and the practice has occasionally proved successful. It is evident that the circumstances are here much more favourable for recovery after puncture than in the case of dropsy within the cranium, since the membranous nature of the sac which contains the water permits it to be readily compressed. The operation may also be rendered more effectual by injecting the tincture of iodine. Injuries and Diseases of (lie Nerves. Wlien a nerve is divided, the part to which it is distributed is immediately deprived of sensation and voluntary motion, and also suffers a diminution in the energy of its vital action, theBRAIN. 481 consequences of which are coldness, emaciation, and proneness to ulceration and sloughing. If the respective extremities are not separated to any great distance, they generally become united by a new-formed substance, and in some rare cases, nervous fibrils have been traced from one extremity to the other. If a nerve is only partially divided, the wound is generally slow in healing—^uneasy sensations are felt by the patient, who refers them to the part where the injured nerve is distributed—and the edges of the external sore are red, tumid, and extremely sensitive to external impressions. In such cases, warm fomentations, and other soothing means, afford some relief; but the most effectual measure for rendering it complete, is to cut the wounded nerve entirely across. "When a foreign body is lodged in the substance of a nerve, the same symptoms that have just been mentioned are produced in an aggravated degree. Agonising pain and spasmodic contraction of the muscles are then induced, so as to make the patient willingly accept the severest terms for obtain- ing a rqlease from his sufferings. Excision o^ the irritating body ought of coui'se to be performed if practicable, and, if this cannot be done, amputation miist be resorted to as the only remedy. Symptoms very similar to those resulting from injury of a nerve sometimes occur without any local circumstances to account for them. The part affected is generally the face. The pain and spasmodic action of the muscles are not constant, but occur in paroxysms, which either come on spontaneously, or are induced by movement of the jaws, the operation of cold, heat, or stimu- lating food, and often mere mental emotion. This Tic-Boulour- eux, as it is called, was formerly treated by simply dividing the nerve affected; but with so little permanent benefit, that the operation fell into great discredit, and was replaced by the use of constitutional remedies, such as a succession of smart purga- tives, especially croton oil, and the carbonate of iron, administered in large doses. But it has lately been found that more perma- nent tliough not lasting relief may be obtained by removing a portion of the nerve, so as to insure its complete division and effectually prevent its reunion. 2 I482 PRINCIPLES OF SURC4EKY. The nerves sometimes become the seat of tumours, wliicli are generally of a firm fibrous structure and yellowish colour, but have been met with of a soft pulpy consistence. They seem to be formed between the nervous fasciculi, which can be traced over one or more sides of the swelling. They are generally smooth, round, or oval; and of a size intermediate between that of a pigeon find hen egg. They occur most frequently in the large nervous cords of the superior extremity, between the elbow and shoulder and at the wrist, for the most part commence about the middle period of life, and are observed more rarely in females than males. They are usually the seat of more or less constant uneasiness ; and when squeezed or otherwise irritated, occasion pain, with spasmodic twitching of the part to which the nerve affected is distributed. They are recognised by their symptoms, by their situation, and by their greater mobility in the transverse than longitudinal direction of the limb. The proper treatment of these tumours, as all external remedies are of no use, is to cut them out. The immediate effect of this opera- tion is insensibility and paralysis of the part concerned; but through time the patient generally recovers, in some degree, the powers thus lost; and, at all events, is freed from the annoyance of the disease, which is often so great as to render his life miserable. Tumours of a similar kind are not unfrequently, met with at or near the extremities of nerves divided by amputation. The enlargement seldom attains a considerable size, being generally that of a pea or marble. It is extremely sensitive to external pressure, which excites intense pain, referred to the limb removed, with spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the stump, while the tumour, even though not mechanically irritated, is hardly ever free from uneasiness. The only remedy is removal, which may be effected either by simply excising the affected pait, or performing a secondary amputation, which is the more eligible course, when the stump has been in other respects imperfectly formed. The Subcutaneous Nervous Tubercle, as it is called, thoughBRAIN. 483 not distinctly connected with the nerves, so far as can be traced by dissection, yet agrees so much in its symptoms with the tumours just described, that it certainly ought to be considered along with them. It is almost always about the size of a ]3ea, smooth, round, or oval, and of a firm yellowish structure. It is seldom, if ever, observed to increase, being as large when first discovered, as it is found to be at any time afterwards. It is seated immediately under the skin, which it slightly elevates; occurs on the inferior extremities much more frequently than on the superior ; and is more rare in males than females, who are usually affected with it before middle age. In one case, the subject of which was a middle-aged lady, I found a tumour of this kind lying under the naU of the little finger. It is the seat of uneasy sensations, which suffer occasional paroxysms of exacerbation, sometime^ periodically, but chiefly in consequence of excitement, either local or general. Emotions of the mind often produce this effect; and it is frequently observed, that the same circumstances which induce the attacks, when repeated, cause their sudden cessation. The only remedy for the disease is excision, which no less easily than quickly and safely relieves the patient from it.484 rRINCIPLES OF SURGEUY. CHAPTEE XXI. SKIN. Erythema, Erysipelas, and Anthrax. The skin is liable to inflammation in consequence of very numerous and various irritations direct as well as indirect. When proceeding from the former, it is either attended with merely local inconvenience, or, if sufficiently severe to disturb the system, occasions symptomatic fever, which presents the usual characters of that accompanying inflanunatory affections. The morbid action of the part concerned does not tend to diffuse itself more extensively, and, according to the particular circumstances of the case, terminates in resolution, piortification, suppuration, effusion, ulceration, or diseased nutrition. Inflammation of the skin, resulting from indii'ect irritation thi-ough constitu- tional disturbance, is distinguished by some important differ- ences, of which the most deserving of attention are its tendency to spread, and the peculiar nature of the disorder in x»ther parts of the system that is connected with it. The terms Erythema, Erysipelas, and Anthi'ax, the last of which may include Car- buncle and BoU, are used to denote the principal modifications which it presents. The first is applied to a very superficial red- ness, attended with hardly any perceptible swelling, evanescent on pressure being applied, having an extreme tendency to spread over the body, occasioning a hot burning sensation, and ter- minating in resolution or death. It is preceded and accom- panied by great constitutional distiu-bance, being ushered in with prolonged and repeated rigors, sickness, and retching, which is sometimes almost incessant for several days together. The pulse is extremely quick, but not strong; the tongue isSKIN. 485 coated with a yellowish-wliite fur, inclining to be dry ; the skin is very hot, often raising the thermometer to 104°; the patient complains of an insufferable burning sensation all over the body; his countenance has a yellow hue and anxious expression ; his mind is weak, and apt to wander. The mucous membranes of the lungs and intestines are often in an excited state, giving rise, by their increased secretion, to crepitation in breathing, and diarrhcea. The disease is extremely distressing and in general very obstinate, recurring again and again after the principal attack appears to have been subdued; but it does not often prove fatal. When death does ensue, it happens either from derangement of some internal organ, especially the brain and limgs, or from exhaustion caused by the continuance of the fever. Erythema is sometimes associated with an inflammatory state of the subjacent cellular substance, which is distended so as to cause a puffy sort of swelling, and generally soon after- wards becomes the seat of purulent effusion, or not unfrequently of slousfhing. The disease generally appears in persons on the surface of whose bodies there is a solution of continuity. This may be either recent or of old standing, but the latter condition seems on the whole most favourable to attacks of the disease. The patient is rendered more liable to be attacked by having a bad constitution, or one disordered by an unhealthy mode of life. The grand exciting cause seems to be some peculiarity of the atmosphere, such as that existing in crowded, ill-ventilated' hospitals, or even in open situations during particular seasons. In such circumstances, the wound, if recent, is often nearly healed before the er^'thema appears. The erythema commences in the neighbourhood of the sore, and then leaving the sldn there in its natural state, travels over the trunk or limbs, or nearly every part of the body in succession. There is hardly any treatment of a local kind that can be used with advantage. Leeching or cupping the inflamed part affords relief for the time, but seems to have no effect in arresting the progress of the disease. Of internal remedies, the most iiseful in the first in-PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 486 stance are emetics, wliicli sometimes appear to cut short the \^ morbid process. The mercurial and saline purgatives, with gentle diaphoretics, should be frequently administered,—^blisters applied to the epigastrium seem very serviceable,—and opiates have often a remarkably good effect in soothing the sensation of heat on the surface of the body, procuring sleep, and otherwise diminishing the uneasy symptoms of the disease. General bleeding can rarely be used with propriety, and stimulants are hardly more admissible except in the advanced stage. By Erysipelas is understood an inflammation of the skin, more deeply seated and less disposed to shift its place than ery- thema, and which tends to terminate in effusion of serum under the cuticle, elevating it into vesicles. The skin may be affected either alone or together with the subjacent cellular texture. In the former case the swelling, though distinctly perceptible, is slight, the surface is red, tense, and glistening, and vesicles of variable size soon make their appearance. In the latter, which is styled phlegmonous erysipelas, the swelling is more consider- able, but the other symptoms are the same; and the most important difference is established by the result, which is apt to be suppuration or sloughing. The constitutional disturbance, that precedes the appearance of erysipelas, is of the same land as that which goes before erythema, but seldom proves so severe. The patient complains of headache, bad taste in his mouth, and coldness ; and when the skin inflames, his general uneasiness, so far from increasing, generally diminishes very much, or entii'cly subsides. The head is the part of the body most frequently affected by • erysipelas, and, along with the external inflammation, there are usually symptoms denoting an excited condition of the internal organs. The causes of erysipelas resemble those of erythema, but differ in so far that they depend more upon peculiarities of the individual. It occurs as often when there is no wound, as when there is one; and it is almost confined to those persons whose , general healtli is previously deranged, particidarly in regard to their biliary secretions, and by intemperance. In theSKIN. 487 treatment more benefit is derived from local remedies, and anti- phlogistic measures of a general kind . are more frequently- required than those of a stimulating nature. When the head is concerned, blood should, if necessary, be abstracted by venesec- tion ; and it is only when the patient's system is extremely weak that an opposite method ought to be pursued. A dilute solution of the tartrate of antimony, with the supertartrate of potass, or the saline purgatives, if given so as to maintain a degree of nausea, with copious discharge from the bowels, exerts a power- ful influence in subduing the disease. Of local means, those of a repellent kind, such as cold lotions, are considered unsafe, at least if they are used before the constitutional disorder has been removed. Bleeding from the inflamed surface sometimes affords benefit, and may be obtained by leeching, puncturing, or scarify- ing. It has been objected to the use of leeches, that it may excite irritation by the bites, but this inconvenience has not been experienced in practice. Punctures to the number of from ten to fifty, repeated once or twice a day (Sir E. Dobson, 1828), have been preferred by some as free from this objection, besides being- more economical and convenient. Incisions of an inch or two in length, and made fairly down to the cellular texture (Copland Hutchison, 1814), are of great use in the phlegmonous form of the disease ; both, in the first instance, by cutting short the in- flammatory process, and also in the more advanced stage by facilitating the discharge of pus or sloughs. Longer incisions, equal in extent to the inflamed surface, and sometimes exceed- ing one or two feet, have been recommended (Lawrence, 1828), but seem to have no advantage to compensate for their severity, and cannot be regarded as exempt from danger in systems not particularly strong. There are few cases that require incisions of any kind ; and great mischief has resulted from their too in- discriminate employment. In persons who are very weak, and suffer intense pain, the best application is a warm solution of acetate of lead with opium. Wlieu there is much swelling of the pai-t affected (Qidematous Erysipelas), pressure is found very beneficial, both before suppuration, and while sinuses exist afterPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 488 the matter is discharged. Tf sloughing takes place (Gangrenous Erysipelas), poultices are proper, until the dead parts are thrown off, after which a nutritive diet is aU that the patient requires. The last-mentioned form of the disease sometimes occurs with very acute symptoms, and runs its course in despite of eveiy sort of treatment, so as to terminate fatally witliin a few days from its commencement. It generally originates from some slight local injury, such as a prick or scratch, but occasionally commences without any breach of the surface having been sus- tained. It is always preceded by, and accompanied with, exti-eme constitutional distm-bance, of which the most remarkable features are excessive rapidity of the pulse, great frequency of respiration, want of sleep, anxiety, dusky complexion, and dark colour of the tongue. Hps, etc. Free incisions, hot fomentations, calomel with opium, administered internally, and a liberal allowance of wine or other stimulants, are the means best calculated to afford relief in this most alarming state, which may be regarded from- the first as all but incurable. By Anthrax or Carbuncle, and Furunculiis or Boil, are im- plied different degrees of a similar affection of the skin, consist- ing in an inflammation fixed to the part where it occurs, but tending to spread in its extent, attended with intense pain, and terminating in suppiiration, with more or less slougliing. The disease is met with of all sizes, from that of a pea to that of a plate. It occurs, when large, generally on the posterior-surface of the trunk between the occiput and sacrum, and, if small, chiefly on the face and limbs. In other parts of the body it usually attains an intermediate size. There is usually little swelling, but great induration. Small apertures take place spontaneously in the progress of the disease, but as these de- pend on detached suppurations in the substance of the thickened cutis, they afford no relief. The irritation consequently con- tinues,—^the disease enlarges its area,—and if of large size, or seated in a weakly subject, may at length prove fatal. In gene- ral, the disease is more distressing than dangerous. It is always preceded by derangement of the system, though it frequentlySKIN. 489 happens that no marked symptom of this attracts attention, until the local appearances present themselves. A state of too full health, or assimilation of food disproportioned to the patient's exercise, and also an irritable state induced by intemperance, and derangement of the biliary secretion, are the conditions most favoiu'able for producing the disease. In the form of boil it often exists in various parts of the body at the same time, or occurs in them successively. It is always accompanied with feverish disturbance, proportioned to the extent and acuteness of the local symptoms. The treatment of all the degrees of this affection should be conducted on the same principles. The first of these is to relieve tension, bleed from the j)art, and afford free vent to the confined matter, by making a freejjrucial incision completely through the integuments to the fuU extent of the disease ;—the next is, to promote the cleaning of the cavity, by applying soft poultices ;—and the third is, to correct the predisposing state of the system, which has induced the morbid action, by a sjoth- ing^,diet. When the boils are numerous and small, the local treatment that has been recommended would be more severe than the disease warrants, and may therefore be omitted, while the constitutional means are diligently employed. In the op- •posite extreme, where the carbuncle is of great extent, it is of the utmost consequence to proceed in the most efficient manner for subduing the local disease, and not only make free incisions in the first instance, but repeat them from time to time, if the inflammation should still at any part threaten to extend. Chronic Ctitaneous Diseases. Under the title of Cutaneous Diseases may be comprehended a great mimber of affections, apparently veiy dissimilar from each other, but which are found to differ chiefly in appearance, and in general to agree very closely in regard to the cause of their production, as well as the mode of their remedy. Tliey all consist in the existence of some chronic preternatural condition of the skin, and have been arranged into divisions, according toPRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. 490 the nature of it. Of these the most important are the Papular, in which the surface is elevated into little pimples,—the Pustu- lar, which consist in small collections of matter,—the Vesicular, in which the cuticle is elevated by small quantities of fluid effused under it,—and the Squamous, in which the cuticle is rendered thick and scaly. The species and varieties of these different kinds, and others that have been noticed, are so nume- rous, that the most concise description of their distinctive cha- racters would require far more space than can be afforded for the purpose in this work, to which, it may be observed, they do not strictly belong, since, though external in theii- situation, they are remedied chiefly by internal means. They originate, in the first instance, with few exceptions, from constitutional disturbance, but frequently become so natu- ralised to the system, as to continue after the derangement that gave rise to them has ceased to exist. Disorder of the digestive organs is the grand source of their production, and they may be regarded as bearing the same relation to chronic conditions of tliis kind, that erysipelas or erythema doe^ to those of an acute form. The circumstances that occasion this disturbance of the abdominal viscera are very various, and many of them were wont to be regarded as the immediate causes of cutaneous disease ; but it wUl be found that they are not truly so, having always interposed, between then" operation and the affection of the skin, some derangement of the digestive functions, which ought more properly to be considered the cause of the disease. In the treatment it is often sufficient to restore the general health, but more frequently it is necessary to conjoin local means with those employed for this purpose, since, as has been already observed, the morbid action of the sldn is apt to become habitual, and to continue after the derangement in other parts of the system that gave rise to it has ceased to operate. For con-ecting the depraved condition of body, all errora of diet must be carefully ascertained and interdicted. The food should be easily digestible, but small in quantity. Bleeding and purg- ing may be used if there seems to be a tendency to plethora.SKIN, 491 Kegular exercise, and an alterative course of mercury, with the saline cathartics, or some mineral water of this kind, are then to be prescribed. In the treatment of scaly eruptions great benefit is derived from the use of corrosive sublimate and Fowler's solu- tion of arsenic ; and from the combinations of iodine with mer- cury and arsenic. Of local means, the one most generally useful is frequent ablution with warm water and soap. Water impreg- nated with sulphur, such as that existing naturally at Harrowgate and elsewhere, or prepared artificially by dissolving a small pro- portion of sulphate of potass with sulphur, usually proves more beneficial. If there are any hairs at the part, they ought to be removed, as their presence is not only a constant source of irri- tation, but prevents the measures for cleansing it from being employed efficiently. Of medicinal applications, the best are lotions containing the acetate of lead and sulphur; the citrine ointment diluted with axunge or linimcntum aquce calcis, in the proportion of one part to four or six; an ointment containing sulphur and axunge in the proportion of one to eight; the ointment of the acetate of lead; a mixtiu'e of the two last mentioned; a solution of the sulphuret of potass, or hydro-sulphuret of ammonia ; and butter- milk. Warty excrescences of the skin are of very frequent occur-. rence, particularly on the face and hands. In the latter situa- tion, they are simple extensions of the natural texture, and prove inconvenient merely from the deformity and awkwardness in using the fingers, occasioned by their presence ; but in the former, they consist of formations altogether foreign to that of the skin, and besides being unseemly, are apt, in the more advanced period of life, to take on malignant action, either in consequence of being irritated, or spontaneously. They generally appear on the hands during the period that intervenes between childhood and puberty, and are seldom met with in adults. They may, if it is desired, be removed at once by the knife, caustic, or ligature, of which means the one first^mentioned is the best; but are in general readily dispersed hy the more gentle492 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. method of exciting their absorption, by applying some stimulat- ing ointment or lotion. Strong acetic acid answers very well for this purpose, if applied every second or third day. When they are seated on the face, caustic, and all other applications likely to excite irritation, should be carefully withheld from them ; and if itching, pain, or increasing size at any time indi- cates activity, and probable perversion of their nutritive action, excision ought to be immediately performed. Corns consist of a thickening or induration of the cuticle, induced by pressure, which excites the secreting action of the cutis. The toes, particularly on their lateral aspect, are most liable to this occurrence; and it appears that there is great variety in the predisposition to the disease, which is possessed by different individuals. The symptoms of a corn are precisely what a foreign body of similar size and consistence would pro- duce, if placed in the same situation. They may be palliated by slicing off the most projecting part of the induration, by wearing wide shoes, or avoiding walking. The radical cure is often attempted by detaching the corn from its matrix by means of a pointed and flat, but not sharp-edged instrument,—^which may be done very completely without bleeding, is always followed by great relief, and sometimes proves permanently effectual. A better method is to soften the corn by touching it with acetic acid again and again until the whole is scraped" out, and then apply the nitrate of sUver to the exposed surface of the cutis, to destroy its morbid secreting tendency. Corns are occasionally not hard, but soft, the cuticle consti- tuting them being white and moist. These soft corns, as they are generally, though not very correctly, termed, usually prove more troublesome than the others. They cannot be detached entirely,—and are apt to inflame, suppurate, and form obstinate sores, if subjected to ii-ritation. Astringent applications, such as that formed by mixing together equal parts of alum and the white of eggs, often afford great relief.493 SKIN. Diseases of the Fingers arid Toes. The nail of the great toe often occasions much distress, by becoming imbedded at one or both of its edges in the soft parts, instead of lying over and protecting them. This growing in of the nail, as it is termed, depends originally in most cases on the pressure of a tight shoe, or on the projecting corners of the nail having been broken off accidentally, or cut away intentionally, with the erroneous view of preventing them from entering the flesh, since they are much more apt to do so when thus rounded oif, than when left in their natural shape. After the edge of the nail has effected an ulcerated breach, it prevents any step toAvards reparation, by causing irritation, which inflames and thickens the soft parts concerned, so as to make them overlap more and more. Various methods were formerly employed in the treatment of this complaint, which seldom did more than afford temporary palliation; of these may be mentioned, cutting away the overhanging edge of skin, touching the ulcerated sur- face with caustic to destroy its morbid sensibility, interposing a plate of some sort between the edge of the nail and the ulcer, and scraping away the morbid part of the nail so as to make it very thin, in order to diminish the force with which it pressed upon the raw surface. M. Dupuytren devised an easy and effectual mode of treatment, which has superseded all the others. This is to remove all that part of the nail which is connected witl] the ulcer,—an operation that may be effected more readily than might be expected, by thrusting one blade of a pair of strong scissors close under the nail, and dividing it quite up to the root, after which the portion that is to be removed being firmly seized with forceps, is twisted out with great ease. Should the nail be exciting irritation at both edges, it will be best to take away the whole of it, for which purpose the pre- liminary division ought to be made exactly in the middle. The wound should be dressed simj)ly, and heals in a few days, in so far as to acquire a cuticular covering. The nail then gradually extends over the surface it formerly occupied, and,PEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 494 unless subjected to imi^roper pressure, occasions no further in- convenience. Small Exostoses occasionally grow from the distal phalanx of the great toe, and also, but very seldom, from those of the other toes. They generally form a tumour under the edge or extremity of the nail, and sooner or later seriously uiij)ede the use of the foot. The nail, if necessaiy, having been removed, an incision should be made, first on one side, and then on the other, so as to embrace the root of the growth, and divide the soft parts covering it, after which it may be readUy detached by the cutting-pliers. Onychia is an obstinate ulcer seated in the vascular struc- ture that lies under the nail, and envelopes its root. It is of small size at first, but gradually spreads so as to engage the whole extent usually covered by the naU. The surface is brown and glossy, the discharge excessively fetid, and the pain intense. The nail is formed very imperfectly, and either remains dry, black, and loosely adherent, or presents merely a small vestige of its root, which is thick, white, soft, and connected by a broad base with its secreting matrix. The surrounding skin is tense and inflamed, and, in cases of long standing, the texture of the subjacent bone is sometimes greatly expanded. This disease occurs most frequently in chUdren, but is met with at all periods of life, and in the fingers -much more fre- quently than in the toes.- It is occasionally referred to local injury, but perhaps always in some measure depends on derange- ment of the general health. After being established, however, it exists as an independent disease, and can hardly be remedied by means that operate on the system. The treatment requires, in the first instance, that the naU should be completely removed, and then that the ulcer should be touched with caustic potass, poultices being afterwards applied until the slough separates, wliile means are at the same time employed to improve the general health. Paronychia, or Wliitlow, denotes an acute inflammation of the finger, generally resulting from local irritation operating on495 SKIN. an irritable constitutiou. The disease is sometimes confined to the soft parts, sometimes engages the tendons or their sheaths, and sometimes affects the hones. In all cases the best practice is to make a free incision as soon as possible through the seat of the disease, which is almost invariably on the palmar aspect. When the fibrovis tissues slough, the dead parts ought to be carefully withdrawn so soon as they are loose, since their pre- sence acts powerfully in keeping up irritation. Leeches, warm fomentations and poultices, are often productive of great harm in the treatment of paronychia, by directing attention from the only effectual mode of affording relief—namely, incision. After the parts are freely divided, a poultice may be applied for a few days, but not longer, as its relaxing effect, if continued, proves injurious. "When the tendons or bones are destroyed, amputa- tion must be performed, a,s the finger, even though it might be healed, could not be of any service to the patient. Exfoliation of the distal phalanx, which frequently occurs, does not require the same proceeding, as the finger, though somewhat shortened by it, is not materially impaired either in appearance or utility. The Palmar Fascia, on the ulnar side of the hand, is liable to contraction, attended with thickening, which produces more or less complete and permanent flexion of the little and ring fingers. This affection occurs in middle-aged and elderly per- sons of the male sex. It seems to be induced by violent exer- tion and pressure of the hand. All Idnds of external apphcations have been found quite unavailing in its treatment, and the only effectual mode of affording relief is to rupture the contracted fibres by forcible extension of the contracted finger, either simply or after a preliminary subcutaneous incision through part of the band, when it is very strong.rRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, 49G CHAPTEE XXII. TPIE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. Inflammation of the Gonjunetiva. The conjunctival covering of the eye and eyelids is very liable to inflammation, in consequence of a great variety of irritations, both direct and indirect. Bright light, intense heat, cold wind, acrid fumes, dust, and foreign bodies of all lands introduced under the eyelids, produce inflammatory symptoms more or less severe, according to the irritability of the individual, and the degree of irritation. The suppression of accustomed secretions, through the operation of cold or any other cause, is also a fruit- ful source of such attacks. The proneness to this inflammation is remarkably increased by habit. In considering the symptoms of the disease, it is necessary to divide them into acute and chronic. The former are—1. Eedness and turgescence of the conjunctiva, the surface of which is everywhere covered with arborescent vessels ; 2. Swelling of the eyelids and watering of the eye ; 3. Intolerance of light; 4. Pain of the eyeball and forehead ; 5. Symptomatic fever. The characters of the chronic form are moderate redness without tumefaction, weakness of the eye when employed for vision, and a disagreeable sensation, as if from the presence of some granular body under the eyelids. Between these extremes there are innumerable shades of difference in the severity of the symp- toms, according to the peculiarities of particular cases. When the inflammation is very intense, the turgescence of the conjunc- tiva is sometimes so great, as to cause an obvious swelling of the membrane, which is named Chemosis. It depends on eff'u- sion into the loose subjacent cellular texture, partially concealsEYE. 497 the cornea, and may even evert the eyelids. The chronic condition almost always remains as a consequence of the acute one, and when it exists independently of this origin, generally, proceeds from some chronic source of irritation, either direct or indirect, as inversion of the eye-lashes, or derangement of the digestive organs. The treatment requires, in the first place, that the eye should be relieved and protected from all sources of irritation. Foreign bodies, if suspected, must be searched for and removed, the eye- lids, if necessary, being everted, so as to bring the whole extent of their miicous surface into view. Workmen employed in forg- ing or gTinding iron are exposed to the entrance of small sparks from the metal into the eye, where they generally fix themselves in the conjunctival lining of the cornea, and, unless speedily wiped oflP, are apt to become imbedded in its substance, where, being extremely small, they may remain a long while, j)roducing rritation without being discovered. The light of the patient's room should be obscured, and he ought to abstain from all attempts to use the organ. Free evacuation of the bowels by mercurial or saline purgatives, leeches applied to the neighbour- hood of the eye, and warm fomentations frequently repeated, are the means of most use. If fever exists, general bleeding, in sufficient quantity to produce a decided effect on the system, should be employed. The blood may be taken either from the arm or temporal artery, but seems to be abstracted most bene- ficially in the former mode. When the chemosis is so great as to impede the closing of the eyelids, some portions of the distended membrane may be cut off with scissors, which relieves the dis- tension, and tends also to subdue the inflammatory action. After the intensity of the symptoms has been subdued, and they assume the chronic character, or if they appear in this form from the commencement of the attack, decided benefit is usually derived from introducing into the eye, once a day, a dilute solu- tion of the nitrate of silver. The vinous solution and tincture of opium, with various other stimulating and astringent applica- tions, have been employed at this .stage of the disease, but the 2 K498 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. solution just mentioned is far more beneficial than any of these. Its most convenient strength seems to be obtained by dissolving- two grains in an ounce of rose-water, but many use it in a much larger proportion than this. Scarification of the inner surface of the eyelids was formerly much practised in the chronic state of inflammation, but is now seldom resorted to, as the relief it affords is generally of short duration. It is executed by everting the eyelid to be operated on, scratching it longitudinally in several places with a lancet, and wiping away the blood as long as it flows with a sponge or piece of Imt. Leeches produce most effect applied to the corners or angles of the eyes, particularly the inner one. In obstinate cases of chronic inflammation, when no permanent source of irritation can be discovered to exist, advan- tage is frequently derived from effecting cormter-kritation by blistering the back of the neck, or introducing a seton into it. Consequences of Inflammation of the Conjunctiva. A purulent discharge from the surface of the inflamed mem- brane occasionally occurs, and constitutes what has been named Purulent Ophthalmy. The inflammation, though probably com- mencing in the conjunctiva, and chiefly observable in it, gene- rally affects the other tissues of the eye, and is apt to prove veiy destructive, when allowed to pursue its course, by causing mor- bid adhesions, opacities, and ulcerations of the organ. It most frequently occurs in infants soon after birth, and in young children. Many explanations have been offered to account for its origin in the former of these, such as the existence of gonorrhoeal or leucorrhoeal disease in the mother at the time of birth; but careful observation of all the circumstances concerned leaves little doubt that the exciting causes are merely those which conduce to common inflammation, operating on a weakly or bad constitution. It is of great consequence to watch the eyes of children, and especially those of very tender age, lest inflammation should commence and proceed without being dis- covered untn too late. The eyelids are apt to be glued together in the first instance, and though they afterwards become tumid.EYE. 499 with distended veins, and of a livid hue, attention may still not be directed to the seat of the disease ; and when at length the pent-up matter gushes out, the organ is too frequently found irremediably injured. If the patient is seen during the inflammatory stage that precedes the purulent discharge, which usually does not extend beyond a day or two, a leech ought to be applied at one or both of the angles of the eyes, according to the age and strength of the child. Warm fomentations, and a frequent separation of the edges of the eyelids, are proper at the same time, due attention being bestowed on the secretions of the digestive organs. So long as symptoms of acute irritation continue, the same soothing system should be pursued; but when the disease begins to assume a chronic form, the solution of nitrate of silver ought to be employed ; and in the still more advanced stage, if it prove obstinate, a succession of blisters applied to the back of the neck greatly contributes to arrest the morbid action. A very violent purulent ophthahny is occasionally met with in adults who are affected with gonorrhoea. There are two opinions in regard to its production : one being that it depends on a metastasis of the disease from the urethra to the eye ; the other, that it proceeds from the irritation of matter casually introduced into the latter part. The former of these explana- tions seems very improbable ; but whatever be the causes of the inflammation, there can be no doubt that it is extremely violent and destructive, in general resisting the most active treatment, and terminating in the serious imperfection or total destruction of the eye as an organ of vision. Free and repeated general bleeding, leeching, and warm fomentations, should be used as early as possible; together with powerful cathartics and anti- monial diaphoretics. If the disease assumes a chronic form, the treatment that has been already explained will be proper. Ulceration of the cornea, or its conjunctival covering, is a very common consequence of inflammation. The ulcers are sometimes preceded by small superficial pustules, but more fre- quently appear without any such antecedent. They are usually500 PEINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. small, round, and of a brownish colour. They possess a veiy irritable surface, and consequently maintain the inflammatory symptoms. If large and deep, they leave, on cicatrizing, a per- manent white spot named Leucoma. In treating them, the measures employed must be varied according to the acuteness of the inflammatory symptoms; but when these are of a chronic kind, as is usually the case, the solution of nitrate of sUver always produces the best effects, and has now completely superseded a practice, formerly much in use, of touching the ulcers with a pointed stick of the lunar caustic. "Wlien the ulcers frequently recur, they will be found to depend on some indirect irritation, such as that caused by an unhealthy state of the digestive organs ; and of course any such source of disturbance ought to be removed as soon as possible. Opacity of the cornea varies in extent and depth. It always proceeds from organizable effusion into the natural textiu'e of the part; but this may be induced in three ways :—1. Inflam- mation, leading to effusion in the superficial conjunctival cover- ing of the cornea; 2. Effusion of lymph into the substance of the cornea with or without purulent matter; 3. Cicatrization of an ulcer. The first of these is named ITebula, the second Albugo, and the third Leucoma. Nebula is a very common consequence of conjunctival inflammation, especially in chUdi'en. It occa- sions various degrees of opacity, according to which, and also its situation in regard to the pupil, it interferes more or less with vision. The remedy consists in the introduction of stimulating applications, which promote absorption. Of these the solution of nitrate of silver is the most efficient. Albugo and leucoma hardly admit of removal The treatment just mentioned some- times produces diminution of the opacity, and is certainly pre- ferable to the more severe measures which have been proposed, such as excision or pxmcturing, since they not only do no good, but generally increase the evU. Pterygium is a fleshy-looldng growth of firm consistence, and flat triangular form. It is seated in the conjunctival covering of the sclerotic or cornea, always beginning in the former, and501 EYE, in its progress tending to encroach over the latter. It generally grows at the internal angle, the apex is always directed towards the pnpil; and the transverse diameter of the eye passes through the centre of its base. It occasions imeasiness, by obstructing the movement of the eyelids; and, if allowed to pursue its course on the cornea, may ultimately impede vision, by covering the pupiL The local means which are proper for subduing chronic inflammation, sometimes check the progress of pterygium; but the radical remedy of it consists in removal. This is readily eflected by seizing the growth with a hook or forceps, pulling it outwards, and cutting it entirely away with scissors curved to one side. If it be so large as to lead to an apprehension of incon- venience from the contraction caused by the resulting cicatrix,— a portion merely of the disease, about a line in breadth, and ninning transversely across it, may be removed. The vessels are thus completely interrupted, and the remainder of the excre- scence gradually shrinks away. A granular state of the conjunctiva lining the eyelids is occasionally a consequence of chronic inflammation, particularly when it is associated with purulent discharge. The surface, instead of being soft and smooth, becomes covered with small elevated points or tubercles ; and the irritation which is neces- ^arOy occasioned by the roughness thus produced, maintains the inflammatory symptoms, so that a reaction is instituted, which renders the ordinary treatment ineffectual. Sometimes, instead of tliis slight elevation and irregularity of the surface, the con- junctiva is extended into large fleshy-looking excrescences, which roll out upon the cheek when the eyelids are separated, and occasionally cannot be reduced without considerable difficulty. In the latter case, excision is the preferable practice; but, in the former condition, which is more frequently met with, though the knife and scissors have been employed, there can be no doubt that the best treatment consists in touching the granular surface from time to time, at the distance of a day or two, with lunar caustic. Staphyloma is a projection of the cornea, of a round or conical502 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY. form, and protrudiag more or less beyond the eyelids. It depends on expansion, together with thickening of the tissue concerned, which sometimes partially retains its translucency, but more frequently loses it entirely. The surface displays arborescent vessels, conveying red blood, and, ia cases where the tumom- is large, acqrdres a cuticular covering. The eye is rendered totally useless as an organ of vision; and the patient is apt to suffer occasionally from attacks of inflammation, which are induced by the exposed state of the organ to external irritation. The disease generally occurs as a consequence of inflammation of the puru- lent kind, but is sometimes brought on by violence. It almost always commences during infancy or childhood ; and after attain- ing a certain extent does not tend to increase. The treatment is either palliative or radical; the former consisting in the use of means calculated to aUay the symptoms of temporary ii-rita- tion ; the latter in cutting away the whole of the projection from within a line of the sclerotic, which is easily done by pushing a sharp-pointed knite through it, and then cutting transversely so as to complete the division, fii'st of one half, and then of the other, while the flap is held so as to steady the part under the knife. After this operation, the humours of the eyeball are more or less completely discharged, and the collapsed coats occasion no further trouble, or may even be made the support of an arti- ficial eye to conceal the defect. The best application during this process is a poultice, and if the inflammation runs too high, it must, of course, be controlled by appropriate measures. Infiammation of the Sclerotic. The fibrous tissue of the eye is apt to inflame in persons who are subject to rheumatism, or who have had thek constitutions impaired by the prejudicial influence of mercury, administered for the cure of venereal diseases. The attack is induced by the ordinary exciting causes of ophthahny, especially exposure to cold. It is characterised by redness of the eyeball, attended with less swelling, and apparently more deeply seated, than when the conjunctiva is the part aff'ected. The distended vessels formEYE. 503 a zone round the anterior part of the sclerotic about a line in breadth, and to the same extent distant from the cornea. Beyond this, the vessels in proceeding backwards observe a radiating direction, and do not branch out as in the conjunctiva. In chronic cases, the eyebaU, along with more or less of the redness that has been described, assumes a sickly yellow hue. The pain is of a dull acliing kind, extending into the forehead, and gene- rally suffering occasional exacerbations, with alternate remissions. The constitutional disturbance varies with the acuteness of the local symptoms. This inflammation may extend to other tissues of the eye, and produce destructive effects on them; but when confined to the sclerotic coat, it terminates always in resolution, or in a chronic state approacliing to it. When acute, it requires bleeding, leeching, warm fomentations, and purgatives; and when chronic, cupping, followed by blistering on the back of the neck, with small doses of oxymuriate of mercury, Dover's powder, and colchicum, administered internally. Iritis, and its consequences. The Iris is liable to inflammation in consequence of local irritation, and also of indirect causes operating on an unsound constitution. The derangement of the system which seems most favourable to this effect, is that resulting from the abuse of mercury in the treatment of venereal diseases ; but bad health from original constitutional defect, or from an improper mode of life, may occasion a predisposition sufficient for its production, when the exciting circumstances are brought into action. It may also result from the extension of inflammation originating in some other texture, as the conjunctiva or sclerotic coat. The symptoms are severe deep-seated pain of the eye, ex- tending into the forehead, with more or less fever, according to the intensity of the local affection; the iris clianges its colour, usually acquiring a dull brick-red hue in part of its extent; the pupU is generally small, fixed, and irregular; the aqueous humour appears turbid; and there is a distinct red zone formed by the enlarged vessels of the sclerotic, at the distance of about504 PEINCIPLES OF SURGERY. a line from its connection with the cornea. The consequences of this inflammation are effusion of lymph on either surface of the iris, which, becoming organized, may cause permanent obliteration of the pupil and adhesion of the iris to the capsule of the lens, or to the cornea. The lymph sometimes exudes in the form of distinct drops, which, when descending to the lower part of the anterior chamber, constitute what is caUed Hypopion. In the treatment of iritis, the ordinary means of depletion, etc., are found to be insufficient for arresting the morbid process. The pain and fever may be thus diminished, but they are not removed ; and the effusion of lymph proceeds as if no attempt had been made to control the disease. The grand remedy for it is mercury, given so as to affect the system ; and if this be done early, while the usual measures for subduing inflammatory action are at the same time employed, and there is no local irritation present, there is almost a certainty of affording speedy and effectual relief.. It is well ascertained that the constitutional action of mercury is the most powerful obstacle to the effusion talcing place, and exerts the strongest influence in promoting the absorption of lymph which has been thrown out. In the first instance, blood should be abstracted generally and locaUy, ac- cording to the violence of the symptoms ; the bowels shoiald be fe'eely evacuated, and then two or three grains of calomel, with a quarter of a grain of opium, are to be given three times a day, until the mouth is affected, when the quantity of the medicine may be diminished so as merely to keep up a moderate degree of ptyalism. In the second stage of the disease, much benefit is often derived from rubbing the forehead and neighbourhood of the eye with a mixture of equal parts of mercurial ointment, opium, and the extract of belladonna. The disease sometimes occurs from the commencement in a chronic form, in wliich case, leeching and counter-irritation, by bKsteriag on the back of the neck, ought to be conjoined with the mercury. The permanent effects of iritis improperly treated or neglected, which consist in obliteration of the pupil, sometimes admit ofEYE. 505 remedy by an operation. The object of it is to make a new aperture ia the iris sufficient for allowing the light required in vision to enter ; and various methods have been contrived for its performance. The most important of these are—1. Making a simple incision in the closed iris by means of a needle with cuttiQg edges, or a small knife introduced through the sclerotic at the distance of somewhat more than a line from the cornea, and carried forwards through the membrane so as to effect its division to the extent required (Cheselden, Sir W. Adams); 2, Tearing away the iris from its ciliary attachment sufficiently for estabhshing an adequate opening, by means of a curved needle introduced through the sclerotic or cornea (Scarpa); 3. Dividing the iris from its centre to the circumference in the direction of two radii meeting together at an angle of 45°, so as to form a triangular flap, the apex of which corresponds to the pupU, and its base to the ciliary attachment of the iris,—a process that may be effected more easily than might be expected, by puncturing the cornea, and introducing the blades of very small curved scissors,—one of which is sharp to penetrate the iris, and the other blunt to prevent injury of the cornea (Maunoir) ; 4. Cut- ting out a piece of the iris, which is done by puncturing the cornea and allowing the iris to protrude, or, if necessary, pulling • it out with forceps, and then removing the portion thus pre- sented by means of scissors curved on the side (Gibson). These methods have been variously modified and combined, and have led to the contrivance of an endless variety of instruments, the particular description of which will be found in the works devoted to ophthalmic surgery. The one last mentioned is easily per- formed, is not attended with much risk of the new apei-ture closing, and is little injurious to the other structures of the eye. The opening of the iris must be made opposite a clear part of the cornea, and the incision of the latter part should not, if possible, be directly over the new pupil, lest the opacity of its cicatrix should throw another obstacle in the way of vision.506 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. Protrusion of the Iris. When an opening is formed in the cornea, either by mecha- nical violence or ulceration, the Iris is apt to protrude through it in the form of a round dark-coloured tumour of variable size, which is extremely sensitive to external impressions, and conse- quently causes great irritation. If the protruded part be cut away, it is replaced by another portion ; it should therefore be removed by caustic, which may be applied every other day. The nitrate of sUver answers best for this purpose; and, by taking off the sensibility of the protruded surface, relieves the patient from pain before the tuniour is destroyed. Dropsy of the Choroid Coat. The Choroid membrane is liable to distension from the ac- cumulation of a dark-coloured fluid, which sometimes contains scales of cholesteriae. The sclerotic and conjunctiva are pro- truded, and becoming thin in consequence of the pressure from within, allow the colour of the fluid to appear through them. The use of the eye is sometimes retained, but frequently lost. If the swelling is small, it need not be interfered with—if large, it may be remedied by repeated punctures. Inflammation of the Retina. In some cases of inflammation of the eye, the Eetina seems to be priucipaUy, if not solely, affected. The patient complains of intense deep-seated pain, accompanied with the false percep- tion of sparks or flashes of fire, while the power of vision is greatly impaired, or altogether susj)ended. In some cases this defect proves permanent, biit in others it disappears, together with the inflammatory symptoms. The most efficient treatment consists in copioiis depletion, both general and local, with active measures for promoting the intestinal secretions.EYE. 507 Cataract The lens and its capsule are liable, together or separately, to opacity, which more or less impedes vision, and constitutes the disease named Cataract, The substance of the lens, when thus aifected, is sometimes firmer than usual, at other times softer, or even fluid, according to which varieties cataract is divided into hard, soft, and mUky. Opacity of the capsule is seated in the anterior layer ; when it exists alone, there is usually no lens, in consequence either of congenital defect, or removal by operation. Lenticular cataract, when solid, is generally of most firm con- sistence at the centre. Its colour is very various, from dark- brown to white when examined through the cornea, but does not exhibit so much difference when removed from the eye, being for the most part grayish-yellow ia the firm kind, and bluish- white in the soft or milky cataract. The last mentioned appears larger, and as if occupying the posterior chamber more fully than usual. Capsular cataract has a grayish mottled appearance, and seems as if flattened. The causes of cataract are involved in great obscurity. It is " sometimes congenital, and then consists either in opacity of the anterior part of the capsule, with atrophy of the lens, or in a soft curdy state of the latter. It frequently occurs at an advanced period of life, after the age of fifty, particularly in persons having light-coloured eyes, where it is generally of dense structure. External violence, as that of a smart blow on the eye, or the penetration of a shaip-pointed instrument into the lens, frequently induces almost immediately the formation of cataract, which in such cases is usually of a white colour and soft consistence. It appears that the substance of a lenticular cataract suffers no change in its firmness during the continuance of the opacity, and that it is either hard or soft from the com- mencement of the disease. The symptoms of cataract are—1, A brown, yellow, gray, or white colour of the pupil, instead of its usual blackness ; 2, De- fective vision, from mere dimness to complete blindness, exceptPRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. 508 that the power remains of discerning the outlines of objects held between the eye and the light; 3. Mobility of the Iris, and the absence of symptoms denoting affection of the nervous system. As the opacity usually takes place slowly and gradually, the indications of it are at first very slight, and increase almost im- perceptibly until it is completed. During the progi-ess of the disease the patient sees best in an obscure light, as the pupil then dilates most, and exposes the lens towards its circumference, where the opacity is less, partly from its thinness at this part, and also from the morbid change beginning at the centre. Belladonna or other applications that dilate the pupil, improve the power of vision, on the same principle, so long as they con- tinue in operation. A great variety of means have been tried for arresting the progress of cataract, and inducing removal of the opacity by absorption, so as to restore the lens to its natural state. None of these have had the desired effect; and it is now admitted, that the only mode of relieving the patient is to remove the opaque body from the situation in which it impedes the entrance of light. The operations performed with this view may be divided into three kinds:—1. Those which merely alter the position of the lens, so as to prevent it from obstructing vision ; 2. Those which extract the lens altogether from the eye ; and, 3. Those which disintegrate the structure of the lens, and expose it to a process, whether of solution or absorption is not well ascertained, but which gradually diminishes its fragments, and finally removes all trace of them. > The fii'st of these methods, or Couching, as it is called, may be effected either by depression or reclination. In the former of these the lens is made to descend into the lower part of the eye- ball, still preserving its original situation in regard to the parietes of the cavity. In the latter its upper edge is turned backwards, so that the anterior surface is directed upwards and the posterior one downwards. Various instruments, named couch- ing-needles, have been contrived for performing depression ; but509 EYE, the most conveuient is the one distinguished as Scarpa's. It is an inch and a quarter long, and slightly curved towards the point, which is sharp. The pupil should be dilated, by the extract of belladonna rubbed over the forehead, or dropped in watery solution into the eye. The patient should be seated, or reclining in a posture perfectly horizontal. The upper eyelid must be elevated by an assistant, who, pressing on its edge with the points of his fore and middle fingers, or a levator if the patient is a child, raises without everting it. The surgeon depresses the lower eye- lid with his fore or middle finger, according to the eye operated on, and places the other at the internal angle, so as to press on the white part of the ball, which powerfully counteracts the tendency it has to roll. He then enters the point of the needle, the convex side of which is turned forwards about a line and a half distant from the cornea, a little below the transverse diameter of the eye, pushing it suddenly through the coats. Pressing the handle towards the temple, he directs the instrument forwards and inwards, between the dilated iris and edge of the lens; moves it freely in the anterior chamber, so as to satisfy himself that it has penetrated the capsule ; next places it across, so as to make its concavity correspond with a line a little above the transverse diameter of the lens, into the substance of which he fixes its point; and then, by a steady decided sweep of the hand, depresses the opaque body into the lower part of the eye- ball, so as to leave the pupil clear and black. He now disen- gages the needle from the lens by a slight rotatory motion, and, waiting a second or two to see that all is right, withdraws it. If the lens rise after being depressed, before the needle is removed, it must be again carried down, and, if it rise subsequently, the operation must be repeated, with an interval sufficiently long to prevent undue irritation. After the operation a piece of lint wet with cold water should be applied, so as to cover the eye—the patient should be confined for three or four days to a dark room and to the antiphlogistic regimen—and the signs of inflammation should be carefully watched for, so that no time may be lost in using active depletion, and the other means that may be required.PRINCIPLES OF SDRGEKY. 510 The bad consequences of the operation are acute inflam- mation, caused by the derangement of structure which it occasions, and a chronic form of inflammatory action, which is not only extremely distressing to the patient, but apt to termi- nate in blindness, by rendering the retina unable to perform its functions, or leading to effusion of lymph in the interior of the eye. The two last of these effects are usually ascribed to con- tinued irritation proceeding from the displaced lens pressing on the ciliary processes and retina. The treatment that has been explained, in reference to acute and chronic inflamrnation, must be employed according to the circumstances of the case. Eecliuation is performed in all respects as depression, except that the needle, after being applied to the anterior surface of the lens, is moved directly backwards instead of downwards. The advantage contended for in favour of this modification of couch- ing, is the smaller risk of inducing chronic inflammation by the pressure of the dislocated lens, which, however, is more apt to rise again than when depressed. Extraction of the cataract is an operation which was not practised previous to the last centuiy. It is effected by making an adequate opening in the cornea, puncturing the capsule, and thus allowing the lens to escape. The advantages of this pro- ceeding are—1. That the lens does not remain to excite ii'rita- tion; and, 2. That no part of the eye is necessarily injured except the cornea, which is not an irritable texture. The objec- tions to it are—1. The risk of wounding the iris, and of allow- ing the vitreous humour to escape along with the lens ; 2. The difficulty of the operation ; and, 3. The danger of the wound of the cornea not uniting by the first intention, and suppurating, in which case, collapse, with opacity of the eye, are the necessary consequences. The instruments required for the operation are a knife for cutting the cornea, and a small hook for rupturing the capsule. Eichter's and Beer's knives are the best for the purpose. They should increase from the point backwards in thickness as well as breadth, so as to prevent the aqueous humour from escapingEYE. 511 until the incision is completed, or at all events carried so far that the cornea is transfixed, since the danger of injuring the iris is not so great after this has been done. The hook should be exceedingly small and rectangular, or instead of it, a curved needle may be employed. The pupil ought not to be dilated, lest the vitreous humour escape. The patient should be seated or reclining, with his other eye covered. The eyelids are to be separated by a speculum, and the eyeball fixed by catch- forceps. The point of the knife is entered about the distance of a line from the margin of the cornea, a little above its trans- verse diameter on the temporal side, and pushed steadily through until it issues at the opposite corresponding part. If the iris comes in the way of the blade, gentle pressure is made upon the cornea; and when the membrane has thus been induced to withdraw itseK, the incision of the cornea is completed at an equal distance throughout from the margin. The eyelids are then allowed to close, in order to dilate the pupil. The hook is cautiously introduced under the flap, and directed into the cap- sule, which should be freely ruptured. The eyelids are again closed, and when they are opened a few seconds afterwards, the lens may probably be found lying in the wound, or exterior to it. If it does not soon appear, very gentle pressure may be made on the ball, with the intervention of the upper eyelid. But if any doubts are entertained as to the capsule being ruptured, or the aperture of the cornea being sufficiently large, it is much safer to remedy these defects of the operation by re-introducing the hook in the former case, and a knife or scissors in the latter, than to endeavour to compensate for them by forcibly compressing the eyeball. The after-treatment consists in confining the patient for several days to a dark room, enforcing the strictest antiphlo- gistic regimen, and employing, without loss of time, the most active means of subduing inflammation, if signs of it should appear. The operation of breaking up the texture of the lens may be performed either through the cornea (Keratonyxis), or through the sclerotic (Scleroticonyxis). In the former way, a small straight needle is the best instrament, and in the latter, if thePEINCJPLES OF SQEGERY. 512 cataract is soft or fluid, the curved one used for couching, but iC it is firm, the edge should be straight and sharp. The pupil ought always to be fuUy dilated, and the eye as well as the patient prepared for the operation in the manner already ex- plained in regard to couching. The needle should be intro- duced at the distance of a line from the sclerotic or cornea, according as it is wished to operate anteriorly or posteriorly. It should be directed to the centre of the cataract, and made to lacerate its texture as extensively as possible. It has been found that the fragments disappear sooner in the anterior than ; in the posterior chambers, and therefore they ought to be urged forwards into it. The process of amendment goes on a long while, extending to weeks and months after this operation, but one or more repetitions of it are frequently required before the cure is completed. As the irritation produced is generally very incon- siderable, this is of little consequence. If a large fragment of the lens, or the whole of it, escapes into the anterior chamber, though solution may take place, there is great risk of such severe or continued irritation as may require its extractioii through an opening cut into the cornea. In relation to the choice of these different methods of operat- ing, it may be observed that the introduction of chloroform has greatly facilitated extraction, and divested it of the objections to which it was formerly exposed, while its advantages in cases of hard cataract remain of unquestionable superiority. Malignant Diseases of the Eyeball. Cancer rarely originates in the eye, though it occasionally extends to it from the neighbouring parts. But medullary sar- coma occurs in it more frequently than in any other part of the body, except the bones, mamma, and testicle. Infants are chiefly subject to its attack, but adults occasionally suffer from it. Tlie retina is generally the part first affected, but in the progress of the disease all the textures entering into tlie fonnation of the eyeball become involved. The first symptoms are blindness, and a greenish or dusky-red colour of the pupil. Then the eye513 EYE. protrudes, sometimes remaining entire, at other times ulcerating, and allowing a fungus to issue. The patient becomes weak and emaciated, loses appetite, and acquires the greenish-yellow com- plexion characteristic of malignant action. The disease varies in the time required for its course from months to years, being usually most rapid in young, and slow in adult persons, but always terminates fatally. The only remedy that affords any chance of relief, is excision of the eye before the morbid process has advanced so far as to render the removal of the whole tumour impracticable, and even then the prospect of a permanent cure is extremely unfavourable, as there is hardly any well-authenticated case of its being accom- plished. In performing the operation, the commissure of the eyelids at the outer angle should be divided in order to gain more room, to dissect out the tumour with a knife or scissors, guided on the fore-finger of the left hand, which being inter- posed between the morbid surface and the edge of the instru- ment, insures the complete excision of the diseased mass. The orbit should be filled, but not stuffed, with lint; and, if the blood continues to flow, cloths wet with cold water may be applied over the face. When suppuration commences, the lint ought to be withdrawn, and replaced by a little simple dressing. The cavity granulates and contracts, but the cure is tedious, and too frequently, before cicatrization is far advanced, the morbid growth reappears. The eyeball is now frequently removed, not in cases of ma- lignant disease, but merely on account of the organ being unfit for vision, and unseemly in appearance—the perfection to wliich artificial substitutes has been brought rendering their employ- ment gi'eatly preferable to such a condition. For this purpose, by means of scissors and forceps, the conjunctiva should be separated round the cornea, so as to expose the tendinous attach- ments, which are divided close to the sclerotic, and the optic nerve being lastly cut through, the eyeball is removed without any further disturbance of the orbit. The conjunctiva thus pre- served covers the sort of cup that remains, and the healing pro- 2 L514 PEINCIPLBS OF SUEGERY. cess proceeds so quickly, that in the course of a week or two, or even by the end of a few days, the substitute may be introduced, and worn with perfect comfort. Tumours of the Orbit. Medullary or cartilaginous growths from the bones, polypous excrescences from the nose, and tumours of independent origin, are occasionally met with encroacliing on the cavity of the orbit, and causing a correspondent protrusion of the eye. Vision is generally impaired or destroyed by the stretching of the optic nerve thus occasioned, but is regained when the eye returns to its place, unless the organ has participated in the morbid action. Before resolving on the removal of an orbital tumom', it is neces- sary that its nature and connections should be carefully investi- gated, in order that an attempt at excision may not be made unless the morbid part can be completely extii-pated. Fatty, fibrous, and encysted tumours, must be completely dissected out. Polypous excrescences ought to be treated according to the prin- ciples that wiU be explained in relation to the nose; and growths from the bone should not be interfered with unless they proceed from the malar or superior maxillaiy portion of the orbit, so that the root is within reach. Eyelids. The eyelids are subject to a chronic inflammation named OpMlialmia Tarsi, which chiefly affects their external edge at the roots of the cilia. The tarsal margin is swelled, red, and the seat of disagreeable itching. The eye-lashes are small, or alto- gether absent. The eye is weak and watery. Children, espe- cially those of scrofulous constitution, are most liable to this complaint, which generally proves extremely obstinate, in re- curring again and again during the period of childhood up to puberty, though relieved for a time by the remedies that are employed to remove it. Stimulating ointments, such as those containing the red oxide of mercury, or the nitrate of mercuiy, are the best local applications, and should be rubbed along theEYE. 515 margin of the inflamed eyelids at bedtime. Great attention ought to be bestowed on the maintenance, or restoration, of the various secretions, particularly those of the skin and intestinal canal; and counter-irritation, by blistering the back of the neck, or introducing a seton into it, is often very serviceable. The upper eyelid, and also, though much more rarely, the lower one, is liable to inversion of the margin, which is named Entropium, This occurrence is usually in the first instance caused by the swelling attendant upon ophthalmia tarsi, and afterwards tends to its own increase, as well as obstinacy, by the irritation which proceeds from the friction of the eyelashes upon the eyeball, and also from the tarsal cartilage acquiring a correspondent curvature, which opposes the return of the eyelid into its proper position. Tumours of the eyelid, and sometimes mere relaxation of it, lead to the disease. It occasions constant uneasiness, and in consequence of this, chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva, nebula, arborescent red vessels, and ultimately complete opacity of the cornea, are sooner or later produced. The treatment is conducted with the view either of palliating or radically removing the disease. The former of these objects may be attained by pulling out the cilia from time to time, or applying straps of plaster, so as to maintain the eyelid in its proper place. As such means are very troublesome and ineffec- tive, much attention has been bestowed on the radical cure, and various modes of procedure devised for its completion. The principle on which these are founded is, to counteract the ten- dency to turn inwards, by removing a portion of the integuments of the eyelid, so as to tighten or tuck up its external edge. Tliis may be done either by cutting, or applying escharotics ; but the former method is unquestionably preferable, since the latter, though recommended by some respectable authorities, is infinitely more painful, tedious, uncertain, and inefficient. The redundant skin is cut away with scissors much more conveniently than with a knife, the requisite portion being embraced between the blades of a pair of dressing forceps, and removed at one stroke. It should in general extend from within a line of thePPJNCirLES OF SURaERY. 516 edge of tlie eyelid, or roots of the cilia, to the same distance from the lowest hairs of the eye-brow, and reach the whole length of the eyelid, so that the form of the raw surface may appear nearly round when the eye is closed. Scissors of the usual form are quite sufficient for the purpose, but they prove more convenient when curved on the side. The cut edges must be brought into accurate contact by stitches of the inten-upted suture, introduced at the distance of a quarter of an inch from each other. The wound heals by the first intention, and leaves hardly any vestige of its existence. In very aggravated cases it has been found necessary to divide the eyelids at their external commissure, in order to obtain sufficient relaxation for effecting the requisite eversion. By Trichiasis is understood a morbid state, which pro- duces nearly the same symptoms as entropium, but depends upon somewhat different circumstances. It seems to consist in an improper direction of the eyelashes, which, instead of defend- ing the eye, turn inwards upon it, so as to cause constant irrita- tion. Attempts have been made to remedy this, by pulling out the cilia, cauterizing their roots, and cutting away their secreting bulbs, or even the whole edge of the eyelid ; but all these means are very ineffectual, and, at the best, afford only a temporary relief. The only method of curing the disease is to ti'eat it like entropium ; and, by effecting a very decided eversion of the ciliary margin, prevent the eyelashes, though still possessing their improper direction, from touching the surface of the ball. Ectropium in an opposite condition, chiefly affecting the lower eyelid. In this case the edge is turned outwards, exposing the lining membrane to external irritation, presenting an un- seemly appearance, and allowing the tears to run over the cheeks. The causes of this eversion are thickening or excrescence of the inner surface, relaxation of the orbicular muscle, and the con- traction occasioned by the healing of sores in the integuments. The treatment must of course be varied according to these different circumstances. If the disease depends merely upon a thickened state of mucous lining of the eyelid, touching it occa-517 EYE. sionally with nitrate of silver, or concentrated sulphuric acid, or shaving away a portion at once with curved scissors, are the means usually employed. If the eyelid is preternaturaUy relaxed, a V-shaped piece may be cut out of it, and the edges then united together by one or two pins; and if the edge is drawn outwards by a cicatrix of the integuments, the contraction should, if possible, be cut out, so that the lips of the wound may be united together directly. Encanthis is a tumour which sometimes presents itself at the inner angle' of the eyelids. It has a fleshy consistence, and tubercular surface. The colour is generally pale red, but some- times very dark, and almost black. It grows from the caruncula laclmjmaliSy and by its pressure not only causes a disagreeable deformity, but impedes vision, and also the motion of the eye- lids. The remedy consists'in excision, which may be performed either with a knife or scissors, care being taken to stretch the attachments of the tumour, by pulling it out with a hook or forceps, so as to prevent any chance of cutting the lachrymal ducts, which lead from the puncta to the sac. Encysted tumours are often met with in the eyelids, particu- larly the upper one. They are sometimes seated immediately under the skin, and may be removed by dividing it to the requisite extent, and then dissecting out the cyst. Much more frequently they lie deeper, and adhere to the mucous lining of the eyelid, which is discovered by their immobility, and the appearance presented by the inner surface of the eyelid when it is brought into view by being everted. The part with which the tumour is connected has a yellowish colour, streaked with red, from the arborescence of vessels over it, and seems flatter than the neighbouring surface. In this case the extirpation could not be accomplished by cutting externally without making a breach through the eyelid, and the proper method is, to remove an ellip- tical portion of the sac from within and squeeze out its contents. The best v/ay of doing this is to evert the eyelid, transfix the sac with a hook, and then cut out a portion of it with a sharp-pointed knife.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 518 Cancerous ulceration sometimes afiects the eyelids ; and, as excision of course affords the only effectual mode of remedy, it is important to determine how far these coverings of the eye may be removed without incurring the necessity of removing the eye itseK. It appears that the whole of the lower lid may be taken away without ahnost any inconvenience, and that a large part of the upper one may also be extirpated without depriving the eye of its necessary protection from external irritation. But if the whole or a considerable part of the upper eyelid required removal, it would be necessary to take away the eye along with it, as the patient could not otherwise avoid suffering extreme distress from the exposure of the organ until it acquired a cuti- cular covering, which, while it afforded protection against inita- tion, would effectually destroy the ]power of vision. It will seldom be necessary, however, to cut out a sound eye on this account, as when the cancer is so extensive as to require removal of the whole or greater part of the upper Ud, it almost always extends to the conjunctival covering of the ball. Obstruction, Abscess, and Fistula of the Lachrymal Passage. The duct which discharges the tears into the nose is apt to become obstructed at its inferior orifice, so as to impede or alto- gether prevent the fluid from descending. This usually occurs in persons who have been previously suffering, from chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva or ophthalmia tarsi, and it has consequently been ascribed to the accumulation of tliick mucous matters resulting from the morbid secretion thus produced. It seems more reasonable to suppose, that, by an extension of diseased action, the lining membrane of the nasal duct swells so as to contract or close the canal. The distinctive symptom of obstruction is distension of the lachrymal sac, forming a flattened round tumour at the inner angle of the eye, lying under the tarsal ligament, and hence often appearing as if bilobated. It is immovable, and when subjected to pressure usually diminishes or disappears, the contents being forced either downwards through the duct, which remains pervious though contracted, or upwardsEYE. 519 through the puncta lachrymalia. When the secretion of the tears is excited by mental emotion, or external irritation, such as that caused by a cold wind blowing on the eye, they nm over the cheeks more copiously than in ordinary circumstances, and the patient frequently complains of a disagreeable feeling of dryness in the nostril. The treatment of Epiphora, as this morbid condition of the lachrymal passage has been named, is conducted on different prin- ciples, according to the view that is entertained of its origin and cause. There can be no doubt that a diseased state of the eye- lids, whether regarded as leading directly or indirectly to the obstruction, ought to be remedied, if possible, without delay. It is then proper to introduce small gold or silver probes through the puncta in order to clear the passage. The canal should be slit open (Bowman) to allow the entrance of a larger instrument than could be admitted by the orifice. By gently urging and alternately pushing or withdrawing a little, it is at length intro- duced into the nose. By repeating this operation, and using probes of larger size in succession, relief may be afforded. The introduction of probes from the nose into the duct, though very easy in the dead body, is hardly practicable in the living, espe- cially when the entrance to the passage is obstructed. Injec- • tions thrown in through the puncta, by means of Anel's syringe, are of so little avail that they need not be particularly con- sidered. If the disease prove so obstinate and troixblesome as to make the patient willing to sufi'er the pain and inconvenience attend- ing the following operation, it ought to be performed. The object is to remove the obstruction, and prevent its reproduction. "With this view an incision is made into the lachrymal sac, by pushing a sharp-pointed knife into it, immediately below the ligament that extends from the inner commissure of the eyelids to the nasal process of the maxillary bone. After the point has been fairly introduced into the sac, by pushing it backwards and inwards, the handle must be raised so as to alter the direction of the blade, and push it downwards into the duct. A thick probePRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. 520 should then be passed through the opening, down the duct into the nose. The obstruction having thus been removed, a piece of bougie, or a small metallic instrument named a style, is intro- duced. The style may be made of silver, lead, or any other metal not readily oxidised ; it is suited to the foiTQ of the pas- sage, and has a broad head to prevent it from descending too far. It should be taken out daily, washed, and replaced. So long as it is worn, the patient is relieved from the inconvenience he formerly suffered, but when it is withdrawn, the passage is apt to close again. Trials may be made from time to time, at the interval of six or eight weeks, to ascertain whether or no the foreign body can be dispensed with. When the obstruction is permitted to continue, it sooner or later occasions suppuration of the sac, and the abscess thus formed being opened naturally or artificially, allows the tears to issue on the cheek, in which case there is produced what may be more strictly named a Fistula Laclmjmalis. The neighbouring integuments become thick and red ; the eye is weakened j and the patient suffers so much from the deformity and inconveni- ence resulting from the disease, that he readily submits to the operation required for his relief. This does not differ from the one that has been described for epiphora. It was formerly the custom to apply the actual cautery, through a canula intro- duced into the entrance of the duct, in order.to destroy the diseased parts which were thought to oppose recovery ; but this practice is now obsolete.MOUTH. 521 CHAPTEE XXIII. MOUTH. Salivary Glands. The ducts of both the parotid and submaxillary glands are liable to become the seat of calcareous concretions, which are named Salivary Calculi. Their composition is phosphate of lime, agglu- tinated by a small quantity of animal matter. They have usually a yellowish-white colour, oval figure, and finely-tuberculated sur- face. They vary in size from that of a millet-seed to that of an almond with the shell. In the parotid duct they are very rarely met with, but in that of the submaxillary not unfrequently. They occasion pain, swelling, and hardness, and sometimes give rise to the formation of an abscess. In the parotid duct, the symptoms thus produced are apt to be confounded with those of rheumatism, toothache, gum-boil, or suppuration of the maxillary antrum ; while under the tongue they may be occasionally mis- taken for those of encysted tumours. In aU cases of doubt, it is right to search the duct with a probe, and to feel for the calculus, by pressing on the place where it is suspected to be. So soon as a free incision is made, the concretion escapes, together with the fluid accumulated about it. The usual situation of these con- cretions is immediately within the orifice of-the ducts ; but they have also been found imbedded in the substance of the sub- maxillary gland, where they excited an increased and unhealthy secretion, with general swelling and hardness of the gland. In such cases the calculus, if distinctly recognised, may be extracted by cutting down upon it, from the mouth, which I have had occasion to do. When the Parotid duct is included in a wound of the cheek,PUmCIPLES OF SURGERY. 522 unless the edges of the integuments be very closely approxi- mated, a salivary fistula is apt to remain at the part. In case it should take place, the patient will labour under the double annoyance of dryness of the mouth during mastication, and a dis- charge of fluid oh such occasions from the preternatural orifice. The use of soft or fluid food, and pressure applied to the gland, afford some palliation of these complaints ; but the radical cure of them requires the re-establishment of a passage into the mouth, and obliteration of the external aperture. Both of these objects may be obtained by introducing a smaU seton through the cheek, from the fistula, into the mouth, withdrawing it after the lapse of a few days; and then, having rendered the edges of the external opening raw by paring them with a knife, uniting them together by means of the twisted suture. UntU the cui'e is completed, the patient should subsist on fluid articles of nourish- ment, and abstain from moving the jaws by spealdng, or any other exercise of them. The neighbourhood of the parotid gland is frequently affected with diffused inflammation and suppuration of the cellular sub- stance, which, owing to the presence of a thin but dense fascia lying over this part of the face, does not form a prominent tumour, and spreads extensively instead of pointing. The patient in consequence suffers great and protracted distress, untU an incision is made to let the matter escape. Morbid growths also often bccur here, and by causing absorption of the parotid in proportion to their own enlarge- ment, at length sometimes completely take the place of the gland. These tumours are generally of the fibrous kind, fre- quently containing cysts in their substance, and tending at length to assume the medullary sarcomatous action. Blistering and iodine ointment occasionally check the increase, or even excite the removal by absorption of enlargements in this situation ; but when they prove obstinate, the only remedy for them is the knife. K the morbid mass is deeply seated, it is necessary, in effecting its removal, to avoid cutting the common trimk of the temporal and internal maxillary arteries, and also the ^orfo'o dnm, or facial523 MOUTH. nerve, the consequence of wMcli is an unseemly and distressing paralysis of tlie face. A very free incision of the integuments should be made to facilitate the subsequent dissection. After the whole of the external surface of the tumour has been exposed, its anterior edge should be turned back by degrees, as the sub- jacent connections are divided, which ought to be done by cutting u^on the tumour so as to divide the connecting cellular sub- stance, without endangering the neighbouring parts by carrying the knife parallel to the surface of the tumour. The arteries that require ligatures are to be tied, and as a troublesome oozing of blood is apt to take place from the glandular substance of the parotid, a piece of lint or sponge should be placed over the wound. Tumours are occasionally met with under the tongue, varying in size, and prodTicing accordingly more or less inconvenience. Of these the most common is named Eanula. It consists of a sac containing fluid, which is usually thick and glairy like the white of eggs, but sometimes is watery, or of a pultaceous con- sistence, like that of porridge or boiled rice. Hardly any limits can be assigned to the extent of such formations, if allowed to increase without interference. The tongue is impeded in its movements—articulation and deglutition are rendered very diffi- cult—the cavity of the mouth is completely occupied by the tumour—and it also appears under the chin. The swelling is generally attributed to distension of the submaxillary duct, owing to obstruction of its orifice, but really depends on the pre- sence of an encysted tumour. The treatment it requires is exci- sion of an oval piece of the cyst, together with the superjacent mucous membrane, which may be easily effected by means of a hook and knife, or pair of curved scissors. The cavity suppu- rates and granulates, and if the lining membrane is very thick, or slow in taking on a proper action, it may be touched with caustic. In some cases I have succeeded in removing the whole of the cyst, so as to prevent any delay in healing from its presence. Fatty tumours occasionally grow in the situation of ranula,PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 524 and present characters so similar as to be distinguished from it with difficulty by external examination. The best way of deciding the question is to make an incision, which, in the event of the swelling proving solid, may be extended sufficiently for its removal. The Lips afford subject of surgical treatment chiefly on account of congenital malformations, and cancerous ulceration. The former of these are usually comprehended under the title of Hare-Lip. They consist in fissures of the upper lip, varying in extent and number, and either simple, or more or less compli- cated with malformation of the jaw and palate. The simplest form in which they are presented is that of a single fissure, extending from the edge of the Hp to its connection with the gum, and seated a little to one side of the mesial plane. In double hare-lip, there are two such fissures, with an intermediate portion of lip, which varies in size. The imperfections of the palate consist in a longitudinal spKt or division, which is either confined to the soft part, or extends throughout the whole parti- tion between the nose and mouth. This Split Palate may exist independently of hare-lip, but rarely does so. The maKormation to which the jaw is liable consists in a projection of the central part that holds the cutting teeth, forming a tumour from which ^ the teeth grow out at an angle to their ordinary direction. In most cases of this kind the projection comprehends an equal portion of both superior maxillary bones—^the portion, namely, which in the lower animals is occupied by two distinct bones, the ossa incidva or intcrmaxillaria. It forms a round knob, con- nected by a narrow neck to the septum of the nose, covered with a firm substance, similar to the gum, and having at its anterior part a similar shaped, but smaller sized, appendage, consisting of the tissue that should have constituted the lip. The fissures on each side of this Imob meet together behind it, and are then con- tinued through the palate backwards. Instead of tliis conforma- tion there is sometimes merely an overlapping of one edge of the split gum over the other, and the degree to which the projection thus formed takes place is extremely various.525 MOUTH. The impediments to deglutition and artiralation, and the de- formity which result from these imperfections, render their complete and early reparation very desirable; but several cir- cumstances in respect to the age of the patient must be taken into consideration before any operation for this purpose is at- tempted. Infants before the sixth month, especially if weak or irritable, are apt to die from convulsions or exhaustion occa- sioned by the hemorrhage which attends it; and, besides this danger, there is another of less magnitude, which is the risk of union between the edges of the lip not taking place properly. Between the sixth and twelfth months the process of dentition is unfavourable for the operation. The surgeon, therefore, if he has his choice, should not operate before the child is two years old, and in no case ought he to do so before the fifth month, or during the process of dentition, until all the incisors at least have appeared. So long as the child is at the breast the opera- tion, of course, cannot be performed ; and it must consequently be weaned, if an early attempt at reparation should be deter- mined on. When the jaw is preternaturally projecting, the pro- minent portion must be either reduced to a proper level by continued pressure, or removed by the knife. If of small extent it may be treated in the former way, but if at all considerable it requires the latter; and it is evidently proper to execiite this preliminary part of the process as soon as possible, in order to render the condition of the lip more favourable for union when the time fol- attempting it arrives. The operation must be varied in some respects according to circumstances, but always essentially consists in joining the edges of the lip after making them raw by paring the respective surfaces. This may be done by means of scissors, or by embrac-^ ing the lip between the blades of forceps and shaving off the portion of the edge that is allowed to project beyond them, or lastly, by seizing the edge of the lip by catch-forceps while it is held between the finger and thumb of an assistant, transfixing it with a Icnife a little above the angle where the two edges meet, and then removing a slice of the requisite extent or thickness.526 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. This last-mentioned mode is on many accounts the one that ought to be preferred, and particularly because it enables the ope- rator to regulate the shape of the cut surfaces more accurately than any other. The margins of the fissure present a convex outline, which, if allowed to remain, would cause the edges, when joined, to form an unseemly angle in the lip at their point of meeting. The respective surfaces should therefore be made straight, or rather slightly concave, so that when brought together they may give the lip its natural fulness, and the lip should be very freely separated from the gum on both sides of the fissure. The two raw surfaces are next united by means of silver sutures, of which three are generally required. They may be taken out on the fourth day after the operation, but the cheeks should be supported for a week or even longer by a strap of adhesive plaster placed across the face. In cases where there are two fissures, the intermediate portion of skin would not reach the margin of the lip, so that both of its edges should be made raw at the same time ; three sutures being then introduced, one at the margin of the lip, one near the nose, and one in the middle passing through the apex of the triangular piece. Fissure of the soft palate may be united in favourable cases by an operation similar to that for the hare-lip, but which is un- certain of execution, owiag to the situation of the parts, their mobility, and the involuntary efforts of the patient. It would be impracticable, except in adults possessed of considerable for- titude, and in cases where the state of the parts is favourable to union, the difficulty of course increasing with the width of the breach. The edges may be made raw by means of either the scissors or the knife, the latter of which is the most convenient. Silver sutures must be introduced, and for this purpose various instruments and modes of procedure have been contrived. The best means on the whole appears to be the simple curved surgi- cal needle with a fixed handle, which should be made to perforate the palate from without inwards—first on one side and then on the other—so as to convey a thread through each, and the twoMOUTH. 527 ends corresponding with the posterior surface having been tied together, so as to form a single thread, the wire may be attached to it and drawn through. The patient for some days after the operation must abstain from food, except what is absolutely necessary, and this should be of a fluid kind. Several repetitions ofihe process have repeatedly been required to complete the union of the whole fissure, and therefore the failure of one attempt or more ought not to occasion discouragement. Small apertures in the soft palate resulting from ulceration may be closed by re- peated applications of the cautery to their margins. Cutting the muscles of the palate as a preliminary to the operation is no more required than cutting the muscles of-the cheek for hare-lip. Fissure of the hard palate was formerly regarded as irremedi- able, except through the insertion of a metallic plate to supply the deficiency. But it is now ascertained that if the soft parts are separated on each side from the bone so as to be sufficiently re- laxed for uniting together, they may be united, and thus enabled to fill the vacant space with bone, through the ossific power of the periosteum in its new position. Cancer of the Lip. Cancerous ulceration frequently occurs in the under lip, but hardly ever affects the upper one, except by extending to it from the other, which seldom happens. This difference pro- bably depends on the greater or more frequent irritation to which the lower lip is exposed by its situation and mobility. The dis- ease rarely commences before middle age, and is met with more frequently in males than in females. It originates in different ways, at one time being preceded by a hard warty excrescence, possessing the carcinomatous texture, and at another appearing first in the form of a superficial chap or excoriation. The cancer, once established, increases progressively, but with vari- able rapidity, being attended with burning or lancinating pain, and surrounded by a remarkable induration. The aspect of the sore is extremely various, but always dissimilar to that of a sound granulating surface. All sorts of applications and modes528 PRINCIPLES OP SUKGEEY. of treatment, except removal of the diseased parte, are found quite unavailing; but, in proceeding to this extreme measure, it is necessary to beware of regarding as cancerous, ulcers not pos- sessed of malignant action, and obstinate merely on account of the peculiar circumstance of their situation. Ulcers occurring on the lip at or before middle age may often be traced to the influence of local irritation, proceeding from the motion of the part, or the asperities of the teeth; and in all cases, unless the cancerous characters should be veiy distinct indeed, it is right to try the effects of rest by confining the lip with a bandage, and of removing any sharp points of the teeth that may be found to project, by filing or extracting them. While this trial is made, the sore should be dressed with black-wash, or solution of the sulphate of zinc, care being taken at the same time to remedy any derangement that may be discovered to exist in the state of the general health. If it is determined to remove the sore, there can be no hesi- tation in choosing excision as the best mode of doing so. Caustic of different kinds has often been used, but, besides being tedious and painful in producing its effect, it is always apt to aggravate the disease by eradicating it imperfectly, and irritat- ing the part which is allowed to remain. The method of excision generally followed is to cut out a triangular or V- shaped piece of the Hp, by making an incision obliquely down- wards on each side of the ulcer, so that the one may meet the other at an angle sufficiently acute for permitting the cut siu'- faces to be brought together and united, as in the operation for hare-lip. When the cancer is of no gTcat extent, and the lip possesses considerable fulness, this procedure is very convenient, and renders the resulting deformity little perceptible. But when a large part of the surface of the lip is affected, there would then be removed so great a portion of the sound struc- ture as must prevent or very much impede the union of the cut edges. In such cases, the method proposed by M. Eicherand is certainly to be preferred. It consists in cutting away the mor- bid part alone with curved scissors, after which the skin andMOUTH. 529 iiuicous membrane ma^^ be stitched together. Ulcers extending over almost the whole surface of the lip may in this way be completely excised, with hardly any deformity or inconvenience. On all occasions the surgeon should take care that the whole of the induration surrounding the sore is removed, and he ought to abstain from operating when the glands under the chin, or in the neck, are affected. Tongue. The tongue is liable to ulceration in consequence of chronic derangement of the digestive organs,—the injurious effect which is produced on the system by the excessive use of mercury,— and the influence of local irritation, such as that proceeding from sharp poiats of the teeth. In the first of these cases, the ulcers are generally small, round, and yellowish-coloured; they are seated chiefly on the edge and inferior surface of the organ, which usually appears somewhat swollen and marked with the shape of the teeth. Their remedy consists in an alterative course of diet and medicine, together with some astringent ap- plication, such as powdered borax or alum. The ulcers that are met with in persons whose constitutions are vitiated by mercuiy present a bluish colour, and are extremely irregular in shape. They affect the edge of the tongue especially, and appear in the form of chaps or superficial excoriations. The sulphate of copper used once a day, either solid or in solution, is the best local application; and the gi'adual improvement that takes place in such states of the system, through time and a proper mode of living, must be trusted to as the means of affording permanent security against their continuance or recurrence. The sores which result from the irritation of the teeth occur, of course, at the part exposed to its operation. They present vari- ous appearances, according to the circumstances of the case, but are easily recognised by the existence of a tooth presenting a sharp edge in their neighbourhood. The treatment obviously reqxiires immediate removal of the initation, by smoothing the rough surface of the tooth, or extracting it; and advantage is 2 MPRINCIPLES OF SUIiGEIlY. 530 also derived from touching the ulcer with nitrate of silver, or the sulphate of copper, in order to destroy its morbid sensibility. Cancer of the tongue is occasionally met with chiefly at advanced periods of life, but also not unfrequently at an earlier period. It is attended with the usual characters of hardness and pain, and leads to similar disease of the glands of the neck. The only remedy is extirpation, and this unfortunately can sel- dom be effected with advantage, owing to the diffusion of the morbid tendency. When the cancer is seated on the apex or edge of the tongue, it may be safely cut out with the knife or scissors, after being grasped and forcibly stretched by means of a hook or hooked forceps. But the result of experience forbids almost any hope of effecting permanent relief by extirpating cancer even of this part, and, of course, if possible still less when the disease is seated further back. The Frainum of the tongue is sometimes originally formed so as to present the appearance of a narrow white band when the apex is turned backwards, and more or less impedes the motions of the organ. This imperfection is easily remedied by cutting the edge of the tight frsenum, and then rupturing the remaining part of it as far as seems necessary, by pushing the tongue back- wards. When children are late of beginning to articulate, whether this be owing to mental weakness or any other cause, the relatives are apt to suppose that the frsenum is confining the tongue, and it is necessary to be cautious in acceding to their wish of having it divided, as the raninal arteries might be opened by making an incision for this purpose in a natural state of the parts. The tongue is liable to a general enlargement of both a chronic and an acute nature. The former occurs in children; and, indeed, is probably always congenital, although apt to be overlooked at an early stage. It gradually increases until the organ may be so enormously enlarged as to protrude from the mouth to the extent of several inches, with a con-esponding degree of thickness and breadth, so that the teeth are displaced, and the jaw even becomes altered in shape. The treatment531 MOUTH. requires pressure together with astringents, such as the sulpliate of copper, and, if necessary, after the use of these means, ex- cision of the redundant poiiion. The acute form of the disease is very rare. It possesses an inflammatory character, and not only occasions great inconvenience by impeding deglutition and articulation, but has even proved fatal by causing suffoca- tion. The most effectual remedy consists in making two or three deep longitudinal incisions into, the upper surface of the distended organ. Eelief is thus very speedily obtained ; but if it should not be so, soon enough to protect the patient from the risk of suffocation, tracheotomy ought to be performed without delay. In cases of less urgency, leeches and fomentations applied to the throat prove sufficient. , Tonsils. The morbid conditions to which the tonsils are chiefly sub- ject, are inflammation, suppuration, ulceration, and chronic en- largement. Inflammation of the tonsils constitutes the most common kind of sore throat, Cynanche Tonsillaris. It is induced by exposure to cold,—is recognised by pain, and swelling in the region of the glands, particularly observable during deglutition, •—and is remedied by general or local bleeding, cathartics, and, after the intensity of the symptoms has been subdued, counter- irritation. When suppuration takes place, the matter is not confined to the gland, but extends into the surrounding cellular substance, and forms a diffused tumour of the fauces, which depresses the palate, renders swallowing almost impossible, and sometimes interferes with respiration also. If the disease be allowed to follow its course, evacuation of the matter is accomplished sooner or later by the natural process ; but, in order to hasten the patient's relief, and prevent the risk of suffocation that might attend the fluid escaping into the throat, while tlie patient is not prepared for it, as during sleep, it is right to puncture the abscess. In doing this, tlie situation of the carotid arteiy.532 PRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. ■ must be kept in mind, as it would be exposed to injury, if tlie knife were directed outwards, in tbe line of the ear. If it is introduced a little nearer the mesial plane than the wisdom tooth, and pushed directly backwards, there will be no possibility I of wounding the vessel; and it seems safer to proceed on this principle than to confide in the instrument which has been in use for this j)articular purpose, consisting of a lancet blade in- closed in a canula, from which it may be protruded, more or less, by means of a screw at its other extremity. Ulceration of the tonsils is sometimes of an acute, but much more frequently of a chronic nature. Astringent gargles, and attention to the general health, are sufficient for its remedy in ordinary circumstances ; but when obstinate, it must be treated more actively, by touching the surface every day or two with a strong solution of the sulphate of copper, or some other applica- tion powerful enough to change the morbid action. Along with these local measures, an alterative course of medicine and diet is frequently required. Chronic enlargement of the tonsils generally results from one or more attacks of inflammation in childhood, and tends to disappear after the period of puberty. In most cases both of the glands are enlarged, but one, in general, exceeds the other in size. The swelHng is firm in consistence, pale in colour, but often streaked with vessels, and unequal on its ^surface. There is great variety in the extent which the swelling attains, from the slightest perceptible fulness to a magnitude that leaves . hardly any space between the two tumours. The sjTuptoms are —uneasiness in the throat, huskiness of the voice, noisy respira- tion, which is generally performed with the mouth open, and sometimes deafness, from obstruction of the Eustachian tubes. But what usually occasions the patient greatest annoyance, is the frequency of sore throat to which the morbid state of the ^ gland exposes him. The ordinary treatment for sore throat affords some palliation of this disease, but the only effectual remedy of it consists in removing a part of the tumour. Caustic, the cautery, and theMOUTH. 533 ligature, though they have all been often employed for this purpose, are decidedly less eligible means than the knife. The two first are tedious and painful in then' operation; and the ligature, while it is liable to these objections, is also attended with great difficulty in its application, owing to the depth of the parts concerned, and the involuntary resistance of the patient. The only gTOu.nd of declining excision is the apprehension of hemorrhage ; but, if the cutting instrument is kept parallel with the great vessels, there cannot be the slightest risk of this. It is not necessary to remove the whole of the tumour, since the portion that remains is soon diminished by absorption, so as to occasion no further inconvenience. Curved scissors might be supposed the most efficient instrument for this operation, but on trial are found not to be so. They can hardly be made to cut thi'ough the whole thickness of the mass at one stroke, and it is extremely difl&ciLlt to make a second, owing to the struggles which are induced by the bleeding. The tumour thus partially detached, hangs down into the pharynx, where it excites irrita- tion that causes coughing or retching, and it has even happened that death I'esulted from this circumstance. The easiest and safest method is to seize the tumour with hooked forceps, and having put it on the stretch, to cut away as much of it as seems .necessary with a probe-pointed slightly-curved bistoury. Teeth. The teeth generally begin to appear in the mouth between the seventh and tenth months, and present themselves in the following order:—1. The two front incisors of the lower jaw ; 2. The four incisors of the upper jaw; 3. The two lateral inci- sors of the lower jaw; 4. The four anterior grinders ; 5. The canine; and 6. The four posterior grinders. The process of dentition, particularly that part of it in which the teeth, by pressing upon the gum, induce absorption of it, and thus form a breach to allow their protrusion, is attended with irritation, which varies in degi'ee, and produces effects of corresponding importance, both local and general. Uneasiness of the mouth,534 PKINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. swelling and pain of the gums, inflammation of the eyes, and eruptions of the skin—particularly that of the head—diarrhoea, convulsions, and fever, are the symptoms most frequently observed. Soothing measures, such as the warm bath and gentle opiates, ought to be employed for allaying them, and whenever they are at all severe, the gum should be freely scari- fied where the teeth are supposed to be pressing on it. A convex-edged instrument answers best for this purpose, and it ought to be carried fairly down to the teeth in two du'ections, so as to make a crucial incision. When the teeth decay, so as to lay open the internal cavity, and expose the sensible pulp to external irritation—pain, or Toothache, as it is called, usually commences. It is not con- stant, and varies extremely in the degi-ee of its severity. Various irritations besides those of a local kind induce its fits, or occa- sional attacks, such as cold operating on the surface of the body, derangement of the digestive organs, or anxiety of mind. Preg- nancy is observed to favour their occurrence. The process of decay which leads to this complaint may often be averted, by scooping out the dark-coloured part of the tooth that sur- rounds the cavity, and filling the hollow with gold or silver foil, or gum mastic. Opium in substance or solution, some essential oils, as. that of cloves, chloroform, and also the strong mineral acids, when introduced into the hollow, often procure temporary relief from suffering ; but in general the only effectual remedy is extraction of the tooth affected. This operation is best per- formed by means of powerful forceps, of which the blades are short, concave, and placed obliquely in regard to the handles. Many ingenious apparatus have been contrived with the view of pulling the teeth perpendicularly from their sockets; but a little attention to the shape and direction of the fangs will render it evident that this mode, granting it to be practicable, would not be convenient. In order to dislodge the roots, it is often neces- sary that the alveolar processes should be broken more or less ; and the best way of accomplishing this is to draw the tooth towards that side which makes the least resistance, at the same535 MOUTH. time raising it from its bed. The forceps, in the hand of one not practised in their use, are apt to detach the crown of the tooth from its fangs, and must therefore be employed with caution. After the process of decay has proceeded so far that the roots of the tooth alone are left, the patient is relieved from toothache, but exposed to other symptoms of a troublesome kind, in conse- quence of the irritation caused by the stumps, as they are called. These useless remnants become loosened in their connection with the jaw, and are apt to occasion similar effects to those which would proceed from foreign bodies in the same situation. In- flammation of the gum, leading to abscess (gum-boil or parulis), suppuration of the cheek, followed by fistulous ulcers opening externally, ulceration or purulent discharge of the nasal cavities, sore throat, and disorder of the digestive organs, are the most common of these ; and th^ir mere mention will be sufficient to shew the importance of removing the stumps of decayed teeth. This is done by means of an instrument named a punch, which should be forcibly pushed into the socket close to the stump, in a pei-pendicular direction, and then, by moving the handle to one side, made to loosen and elevate it. Hemorrhage occasionally occurs to a troublesome or even alarming extent after the extraction of teeth or stumps. The best application is dry lint forcibly pressed into the cavity, which proves much more effectual than the use of caustic or the actual cautery. Abscess of fhe Antrum. The cavity of the maxillary bone is liable to become the seat of abscess in consequence of the lining membrane talcing on a suppurative action. The fluid escapes partially into the nasal cavity when the head is laid in the horizontal posture, but the outlet thus afforded is not sufficiently free to allow the parts to return to their healthy state. The bone is gradually expanded, so as to elevate the cheek and depress the palate; dull aching pains are felt at uncertain times throughout the face and head; and the superjacent integuments are usually thick and red. A dependent opening into the cavity may be easily formed byPEINCIPLES OF SUKGEKY. 536 pulling one of the grinders, or a stump remaining in the place of one of them, as the partition between the bottom of the alve- olar hollow and the antrum is so thin as to afford no resistance which a common probe is not able to overcome. In this way, however, little advantage is obtained, as the matter is still not evacuated with sufficient freedom, and it is usually found neces- sary to establish a more ample aperture by separating the cheek from the gum opposite the bicuspid teeth, and breaking down the anterior wall of the cavity, sufficiently to admit the point of a finger, which, oAving to the weakness of the bone at this part, may be executed more easily than might be expected. Tumours of the Gums and Jaws. Excrescences of a firm substance, irregular surface, and usually whitish colour, are not unfrequently met with proceeding from the gums. If allowed to pursue their own course, they increase in size, loosen the teeth in their neighbourhood, and at length may prove fatal by causing hemorrhage, profuse discharge of matter, or excessive and long-continued pain. These growths ought to be freely cut away, and as they extead to the alveolar process, the adjacent teeth must be extracted, so that the excision may be completely effected by cutting-pHers. Both the upper and the lower jaws are liable to morbid degene- ration of structure, giving rise to medullary and fibro-cartilagin- ous tumours. The former occurs more frequently in the upper than the lower, and generally extends to the bones of the nose and orbit; the latter is more common in the lower jaw. The medullary growth, as in other parts of the system, is attended with severe pain, an unhealthy appearance, and in its more ad- vanced stage, profuse fetid discharge or hemorrhage. The fibro- cartilaginous tumour, though sometimes in the first instance the seat of uneasy sensations, u.sually produces no inconvenience except by its bulk, to wliich no limits can be set. At length occasional bleeding takes place from the surface, but this seldom happens until the tumour has existed for years, and attained a V ery large size. There is never any purulent or fetid matter dis-537 MOUTH. eliarged, and the substance of the mass remains as dense and entire as at the commencement of its formation. This kind of growth is usually met with in young persons between puberty and middle age. The only method of relieving the patient from these tumours, whether of the one kind or the other, is complete excision. This used to be attempted by cutting out with saws, forceps, and chisels, the diseased mass alone, the adjacent part of the jaw being allowed to remain. Such operations, with hardly any exception, proved ineffectual in accomplishing a radical cure, as the smallest portion of bone possessing the morbid disposition, that was not eradicated, insured a return of the disease. The gi'eat improvement has been introduced into modern surgery of amputating the jaws when they become the seat of these forma- tions, in a part of their extent which is perfectly free from enlargement, or any other indication of unhealthy action. The names of Grafe of Berlin, Dupuytren of Paris, Mott of ISTew York, Crampton and Cusack of Dublin, and Gensoul of Lyons, are most deserving of mention for adopting and establishing this operation. It has been performed with almost uniform success in cases of the fibro-cartilaginous tumour both of the upper and the lower jaw, and also on account of the medullary growth. From the nature of the bones entering into the formation of the upper jaw, complete eradication is practicable only when the disease is confined to the superior maxillary bone. Growths from the fore- head and bones of the nose must be carefully distinguished from those that, possess this limited origin, as no satisfactory result would attend their removal. In performing excision of the superior maxillary bone, an incision should be made through the cheek, extending either from the junction of the maxillary and malar bones to the angle of the mouth, or from the inner angle of the eye directly down through the lip. The integument having been dissected from the tumour, and the margin of the orbit exposed, one blade of a large pair of cutting-pliers is mtroduced into the nose, and the other into the orbit, so as to divide the nasal process of thePRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 538 maxillary bone. The connection with the malar bone is next separated in the same way, and then the palate is divided, pre- viously to which one of the incisor teeth must be extracted it" necessary. The surgeon having now deprived the bone of all its principal attachments, wrenches it out. There is seldom much bleeding, and no advantage is obtained by tying the carotid pre- viously. The only vessels that req^uire to be tied are the facial and posterior palatine arteries, and the latter not always. The cavity of the cheek should be moderately filled with pieces of lint, and then the edges of the wound are brought carefully together by means of the silver sutures. The deformity wliich remains after the cure has been completed is very inconsiderable, and the jDatient is able to speak, eat, and swallow, with much less imperfection than might be expected. In the event of the cure proving permanent, an artificial substitute for the palate may be adapted to the cavity. Excision of the lower jaw is an easier and less formidable operation. The mode of performing it must be varied according to the size and situation of the tumour. It is usually either con- fined to one side of the bone, or engages one side more than the other. The base is the part most frequently affected, but the ramus is sometimes implicated, so as to reqvdre disarticulation. The best direction for the incision through the cheek is along the base as far as the tumour extends, and, if necessary, up along the posterior margin of the ramus to the condyle. The integu- ment having been separated from the tumour, the jaw is partially cut through with a smaU saw, and completely divided by strong cutting-pliers. The surgeon then grasping the detached portion turns it outwards, and separates its connections with the muscles and mucous membrane of the mouth. If the symphysis is included, means must be employed to prevent suffocation from the tongue being drawn back by the muscles of deglutition, owing to the power which kept it forward having ceased to act. As it is only for a minute or two that there is any risk of this occur- rence, the best mode of proceeding is to seize the tongue with a ihook, and confide it to an assistant until the tendency to retrac-539 MOUTH. tiou ceases. The only arteries that require to be tied are the facial, and the transverse branches of the temporal, in the case of cutting over the ramus. The cavity of the wound shoiild be gently filled with pieces of lint, after "which sutures are to be introduced so as to retain the cut edges in accurate contact. If it is necessary to remove the bone at its articulation, the opera- tion should be conducted as has been described, until the jaw is divided on that side of the tumour where it remains sound. The tumour is then pulled outwards, while its connections with the mouth are detached, and at the same time depressed so as to bring the coronoid process within reach. The attachment of the temporal muscle having been divided, the bone is more fully depressed, so as to expose the articrdation, into which the knife is carried close round the condyle, in order to avoid the internal maxillary artery, which crosses the neck of this process on its inner surface about half an inch below the joint. The remaining connections are lastly divided, and the operation concluded as has been directed. The small amount of deformity or inconvenience of any kind occasioned by the excision of the greater part of the lower jaw, can be conceived only from actual observation, and, as well on this account as the relief afforded to the patient from an oppressive and idtimately fatal disease, the operation may be regarded as one of the greatest improvements in the practice of modern surgery.540 PKINCIPLES OF SUKGliKV. I CHAPTEE XXIV. NOSE. Extraction of Foreign Bodies from the Nose. Children frequently introduce small bodies, such as i^eas or cherry-stones, into the nostrils, where they are sometimes de- tained in consequence of the enlargement which they suffer, the swelling that takes place in the parietes of the cavity, or simply from their being pushed in with greater force than can be ap- plied from within for their expulsion. The immediate incon- venience is seldom considerable, and the presence of the foreign body often escapes observation for a long while. Sooner or later a purulent discharge and ulceration are induced, and it may happen that surgical assistance is required on account of these symptoms months after the body has been introduced, and when its existence is not known, either from having never been discovered, or from having been completely forgotten. In all cases, therefore, of matter being discharged from one nostril of a child, the surgeon should search the cavity to ascertain if it con- tains any foreign substance. This is most effectually done by means of forceps with narrow blades terminating in small pro- jecting points. They should be introduced with the branches fully expanded, and held in a vertical direction, parallel with the septum of the nose. From the flattened shape of the nostril they may thus be passed behind any body, however firmly im- pacted in it, and, after being fairly introduced, they should be closed so as to seize anything that may be present. One or two trials conducted in this way will enable the surgeon to satisfy hiuiseK whether or no there is a foreign body lodged in the cavity, and to extract it if detected. When the extraneous sub-541 HOSE. stance has been recently introduced, the process of removal should be performed in the same manner. EjpistcLxis, or Bleeding from the Nose. Hemorrhage from the nose frequently takes place, either commencing spontaneously, or being induced by the injury attending operations in which the parietes of the cavity are concerned. Spontaneous bleeding is generally suppressed by applying cold to the forehead, or introducing a piece of lint, moistened with spirits or some astringent saline solution, into the nostrils. The same means usually prove sufficient when mechanical violence has been the exciting cause. But, in both cases, it occasionally happens that more efficient measures are required ; the blood, though prevented from flowing through the anterior openings of the nose, being observed to trickle down into the throat. It is then necessary to close the posterior nares '-^ also, by introducing a piece of lint. This may be done in various ways, and instruments have been contrived for the pur- pose ; but the most convenient method is to pass a probe, curved to the form of the palate, through the nose into the pharynx, and then draw it out of the mouth, conveying by its means a piece of strong ligature, about a foot and a half in length. A compress of lint, large enough to obstruct the pos- terior opening of the nostril, is next tied securely to the middle of the thread which issues from the mouth. The other end being pulled, this plug is drawn backwards, and, with the assist- ance of the operator's left fore-finger, is lodged behind the soft palate, at the nasal orifice. The two ends of the thread are then secured; and when it is judged safe to remove the plug, the thread that lies in the mouth affords the ready means of doing so. Polypus of the Nose. Tumours of several different kinds are met with in the nasal cavities ; and though comprehended under the general denomi- nation of polypus, must be carefully discriminated in regard to their prognosis and treatment. The most common of these542 PKINCIPLES OF SURGERY. growths possess a soft, but rather tough consistence, and yellowish-gray colour; they bleed slightly when injured, and have not much sensibility; they often contain collections of limpid fluid, so as to constitute thin bags. These are named Simple, Mucous, or Benign Polypi. They grow from the mucous membrane generally, where it covers the upper part of the nostrils, sometimes where it lies upon the inferior spongy bone, but never from the septum. They seldom exist singlj, and are often met with in numbers together. One^jiostril is very rargly. affected alone. They occur at aU periods of life, but are most frequent about middle age. They enlarge until the cavity is filled, and then remain stationary, without causing any expansion of the face by the pressure proceeding from their con- tinued increase. The symptoms which they occasion are, obstruction of respiration, an uneasy sensation of stuffing of the head, dulness or total loss of smeU and taste, and sometimes deafness. It is generally observed that these symptoms are most distinct in moist weather, and least so in an opposite state of the atmosphere. The treatment of mucous polypus consists in removing them; and though various methods have been employed for this purpose, there can be no doubt that the best mode of effect- ing it is evulsion by forceps. The instrument must be so small that its blades can be passed up along the sides of ^the polj^ius to its root, where they should be fixed by strong compression of the handles. The surgeon then, by a compound movement of pulling and twisting, the latter of which should be steadily in one direction, endeavours to disengage the connections of the tumour. He may fail in the first or several.subsequent attempts, but by careful and persevering efforts, guided by acquaintance with the shape of the cavity, he is sure of ultimately eradicating the disease. Except in those rare cases where the polypus is single, the patient can hardly be completely relieved by one operation ; and the nostrils, though seemingly quite cleared, arc again and again found more or less occupied by a similar excrescence. The cause of this is probably not so much repro-543 NOSE. duction as expansion of the polypous growth, and the repeated relapses, tlierefore, ought not to occasion discouragement. Astrin- gent washes and caustic are sometimes employed to repress the tendency to new formation, hut there is reason to helieve that the good effects ohtained in this way are very inconsiderable, and it would be improper to confide in them so far as to with- hold the use of the forceps, so long as any vestige of the disease can be discovered to exist. It is necessary to beware of mis- taking for this disease a mere thickening of the mucous mem- brane over the inferior spongy bone, which is common in children, or a projection of the septum to one side, which exists to a slight degree in most people, and not unfrequently encroaches so mucli on the nostril as to occasion serious inconvenience. The next kind of polypous growth from the nasal cavities that may be mentioned is of variable consistence, from the soft- ness of brain to the firmness of glandular tissue, but is always extremely friable in its structure, so as to tear easily, and when subjected to extension, gives way at the part where the force is applied. It bleeds profusely when injured—tends to increase without any limitation, making room for its accommodation by expanding and separating the bones of the face—and is found to originate from the osseous substance of the parietes of the cavity. This medullary, bleeding, or malignant polypus, as it is named, usually occurs at the middle and later periods of life. It is distinguished by the characters which have been mentioned, and by being attended with pain, and bloody or purulent fetid discharge. The rapidity of its progress is very variable, but its result is always unfavourable. The radical removal of this disease is impracticable, and when the morbid disposition is very active, or when the disposi- tion to bleed is great, any attempts to delay its progress by extracting as miich of the mass as can be reached, are hardly- prudent, being more likely to accelerate than prolong the patient's fate. In cases of a milder description, advantage may be derived from clearing the nostrils occasionally, which is easily accom- plislied, and relieves the patient from time to time. The opera-PRINCIPLES OF SURGRRY. 544 tion cannot be performed well with forceps alone, as the want of cohesion in the morbid structure prevents them from removing any more of the mass than what is actually embraced between their blades. Knives, scissors, and hooks are employed, but the best instrument for the purpose is a finger, which, being intro- duced into the expanded nostrils, feels where the pol}qpus is attached, and forces it away from the bone. The cavity, having been thus emptied, is stuffed with lint to stop the bleeding. The third and last kind of polypus that requii-es to be noticed is remarkably distinguished by the extreme firmness of its tex- ture, which nearly equals tendon in strength. It is distinctly fibrous, and has hence been named the Fibrous Polypus. It bleeds profusely when injured, increases without any limit, descendmg into the pharynx, and proceeding beyond the external orifice of the nose, and ultimately proves fatal by causing hemor- rhage, suffocation, or pressure on the brain, It almost always exists singly, and occurs chiefly in young adults of the male sex. M. Dupuytren, who first remarked the peculiarities of tliis fibrous structure, supposes that it frequently exists as an antecedent of the medullary or brain-like polypus, into wliich it degenerates, first at the part most distant from its root, and ultimately throughout its whole extent. It may be stated, however, on the evidence of extensive observation, that the soft kind of growth often (so far as I have seen, always) disj)lays its proper charac- ters from the commencement; and there are cases on record in which the fibrous polypus retained its distinctive firmness of texture after existing for years, and attaining a great size. It seems to adhere to the bone, but not to depend on any diseased condition of that tissue, so that if torn out by the root it may be permanently removed. This method has been recommended by Dupuytren as the only mode of effectual treatment. Sometimes it distends the antrum, maxillarc,—and, having caused absorp- tion of the walls of the cavity, protrudes under the cheeks, where it may be exposed by dividing the mucous membrane of the mouth, and seized with forceps. The instruments for this purpose should be very strong, and provided with numerousNOSE, 545 large projecting teetli. Several pairs in general are required to be fixed in succession as space is gained,—and the strength of two or more stout assistants has been found necessary to effect the evulsion. In performing such operations, the surgeon should be prepared for a profuse hemorrhage,—and, as a precautionary measiu'e, ought to pass a thread for plugging the posterior open- ing of the nostril, if this should prove necessary. Polypous growths of different kinds sometimes, instead of growing forwards into the nose, descend into the pharynx. In such cases the best plan is to detach the polypus by seizing its roots with forceps introduced through the nostril, and then draw it from the nose or push it iato the throat. Ulcers and other Diseases of the Aim of the Nose. It has already been observed that warty excrescences on the face are apt to degenerate into malignant sores in the advanced period of life. When cancers, originating from this or other sources, are seated over the cartilages of the nose, it is prudent to cut away a portion of the whole thickness of the jDarietes, as the disease can hardly be extu-pated otherwise, and ineffectual attempts would probably promote the diseased process. If this operation is performed early, the cut edges may be brought together and united so as to leave no perceptible deformity. The skin of the nose is liable to an over-growth, which at first makes it present a warty or tuberculated appearance, but when more advanced, completely alters its shape, and constitutes large, irregular, pendulous masses, which occasion great defor- mity and inconvenience. In cases of this kind, that are so aggravated as to warrant an operation, the redundant substance may be shaved off, while the surgeon, by keeping his finger in the nostril, ascertains the extent to which he should cut. Cold applications restrain the bleeding; and when cicatrization is completed, wonderfully little trace of the disease remains. It may afterwards return and require similar treatment, but the operation is seldom necessary more than once. Lupus, or noli me tangere, is an obstinate ulceration of the 2 N546 PEINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. nose or adjacent parts, always superficial in the first instance, and generally contimiing so, l)ut sometimes extending more deeply and causing extensive destruction of the face. It presents various appearances, but in general has the character of healing at one part while it extends at another. The ulcer is usually covered with a scab, and surrounded with inflamed skin. The disease, though left to itself, sooner or later suffers a spontaneous cure, but seldom until great deformity is occasioned by its ravages. It occurs chiefly in youth, and affects females more frequently than males. The treatment of this affection is very unsatisfactory, since the mode employed often proves unavailing, or procures merely a temporary amendment. The general health, if deranged, ought to be restored if possible by an appropriate course of alterative medicine and diet; but it is on local applications that the principal reliance is usually placed. Of these, different prepara- tions of arsenic are regarded as the most ef&cient; but I have found most advantage from the use of caustic potass. Restoration of the Nose. The nose may be defective as a fault of original formation, or from the effects of violence, or in consequence of ulceration. The want of this feature not only causes a most disagi'eeable deformity, but impairs the sense of smell, and exposes the patient to annoyance from the entrance of foreign matters into the nostrils. Ingenious practitioners have endeavoured to con- struct a substitute for the lost part, by attaching in its place a flap of skin taken from some other part of the body. There are two methods that have been chiefly followed in doing this, which are named the Italian and Indian. The former was contrived and practised by Taliacotius. It consisted in dissect- ing from the arm a flap of skin, uniting one of its edges to the face, wliile the other remained attached to the arm, and after the iinion was completed, separating the piece of skin entirely from the arm, fashioning it properly for representing the nose, and completing its union with the face. This operation seems to547 NOSE. have been repeatedly performed by Taliacotius, and some of his contemporaries, but has not been adopted in modern surgery. The Indian method is simpler, and better calculated to attain the object in view. It is executed by dissecting from the forehead a flap of skin sufficient for constructing the absent feature. The size and shape requisite for this purpose having been determined by fitting a piece of card or wax into its place, and then expand- ing this upon the forehead, where its extent is defined by marking the skin round it with ink, the flap is detached, with the exception of a narrow slip at its lower part, which is left to supply, it with nourishment, and its edges are connected by stitches to raw surfaces formed where they are required on the face. Tubes are inserted into the nostrils to permit respiration, and a sufficient quantity of lint is introduced to give them the requisite shape. Cloths wet with cold water are then applied to moderate the subsequent action, and promote union by the first intention. This operation, which seems to be of very ancient origin, was first adopted in tliis country by Mr. Carpue. It lias since been frequently j)ractised both at home and abroad, and often with results highly creditable to the dexterity of the operators. But though noses may thus be formed which would not attract attention at a distance, and appear tolerably well in a drawing, where the disparity of colour, surface, and other 'characters are not expressed, it must be admitted, that the sub- stitute is almost always even more disagreeable than the deficiency; and there is good reason for regarding such achieve- ments as more curious than useful, especially as by means of enamel or other suitable compositions, imitations of the lost part may be constructed, which prove more seemly, and much less uncomfortable to the patient.PRINCIPLES OF SURGEEY. 548 CHAPTER XXV. THE EAR Foi'cign Bodies in tlie Ear. Children are veiy apt to introduce peas and other small bodies into the ear, and attempts to remove them with forceps of the usual construction tend to press them inwards. The forceps, or a slightly-curved steel probe, is the most convenient instrument for the purpose. It has happened that the extraneous substance, by swelling after its introduction, or by being very forcibly in- serted, resisted the most careful efforts at removal in this way, and it has become necessary to make an incision into the tube of the ear at its posterior side, so as to permit the introduction of a hook or probe for effecting the dislodgement. Such a proceed- ing can very rarely be necessary, and the surgeon should beware of having recourse to it in cases where he cannot detect the foreign body by external examination, and is led to believe in its presence merely by the relation of the patient's friends, as an erroneous impression of this land is frequently produced by dis- agreeable feelings in the ear, remaining after the removal of some irritating substance. The ceruminous secretion of the ear frequently accumulates in undue quantity, and occasions deafness more or less complete. When this is discovered by inspection of the cavity in a bright light, a little oil should be introduced to soften the mass, after which repeated injections of warm water are to be thro^Ti in to wash out the wax. The patient should afterwards avoid ex- posure to cold, and take measures to prevent the same thing from happening again. A preternaturally dry state of the meatus and membrane of549 EAR. the tympanum, depending npou a deficient secretion of wax, also impairs the sense of hearing, and benefit in such circumstances is often derived from anointing the surface with some stimulat- ing ointment, as a mixture of axunge with a small proportion of oil of cloves, or any other of a similar kind. Inflammation and Suppuration of the Ear. Inflammation of the ear is generally induced by exposure to cold. It is attended with pain, more or less acute, and either confined to the ear, or extending tlirough the head. Pressure or motion of the auricle increases the patient's distress, and there is constitutional disturbance in proportion to the severity of the local complaint. The attack terminates in resolution or suppura- tion, the matter in the latter case being effused, either exteriorly to the membrane of the tympanum, or within it, so as to cause pressm'e and absoi-ption, for obtaining vent to escape. In the former case there is merely a running, which admits of cure without loss of hearing; but in the latter, there is apt to be caries of the temporal bone, and a permanent discharge, with partial or complete deafness. The treatment of the inflammatory state requires bleeding, cathartics, warm fomentations, and the antiphlogistic regimen. The chronic discharge of matter demands the injection of metallic washes, and blistering on the back of the neck. And when the bones are affected, the same means may be employed, but with an unfavourable prognosis. Recovery from this state sometimes occurs ; but more frequently the disease proves obsti- nate, and occasionally fatal, by leading to a morbid condition of the brain, particularly the formation of abscesses in its substance. Polypus of the Ear. Polypous excrescences are occasionally met with growing from the cavity of the ear, and protruding either through the external aperture, or an opening caused by absorption in the pos- terior wall of the canal. They usually possess a floiid colour, and vascidar structure. They are attended with a thin niuco-550 PKINGIPLES OF SUKGKHY. puruleut discharge, aud seem to agree in their nature with the growths v/hich spring from the lining membrane of the prepuce and the conjunctiva, in consequence of inflammation terminating in suppuration. The best mode of treating them is to pull away with forceps as much as possible of their substance, and then touch the remaining surface with nitrate of silver, afterwards using injections of sulphate of zinc, or other metallic solutions, to correct the morbid action of the membranes. Obstruction of tJie EusiacJdan Tuhe, and Perforation of the Membrane of the Tympanum. The Eustachian tube is liable to be obstructed at its pharyn- geal extremity by a variety of circumstances, of which the most deserving of notice are, thickening and adhesion of its lining membrane, consequent on inflammation of the throat, enlarge- ment of the tonsils, and nasal polypus. It has been already mentioned, in regard to the two last of these affections, that they occasionally give rise to deafness in this way, which is relieved by their removal. But when the tube is closed, the only method of restoring the patient's hearing is to remove the obstruction, by introducing probes or injections through the nose into the contracted or obliterated tube. This operation is so extremely difficult and imcertain, that it cannot be regarded as affording any real advantage ; and it has therefore been proposed, in such cases, to make an opening in the membrane of the tympanum, so as to place it in equilibrium as to the pressure of the atmos- phere, on its internal as well as external surface. Numerous attempts have been made with this view, and frequently with temporary benefit. The return of deafness, which the patient has almost always suffered, has been ascribed to closure of the aperture, and various modes of making it have been proposed, in order to prevent the edges of the wound from uniting. It is probable, however, that the relapse depends on other circum- stances, as it is not easy to conceive how the edges of such wounds could unite, except as a rare accident, and since the deafness has returned, even after a part of the membrane was actually removed.INDEX.

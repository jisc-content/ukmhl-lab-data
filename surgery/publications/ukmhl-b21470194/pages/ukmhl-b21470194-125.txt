BLOOD-VESSELS, 103 removed as it were from the current of circulation, and exposed to a surface different from that of the healthy vessel, has a douhle inducement to coagulate, and accordingly does so, not all at once, but by degi'ees, thus forming a succession of concentric fibrinous laminse, which line the aneurismal sac, and sometimes fill its cavity completely. The arteries liable to this disease are almost all the great trunks of the system; and the parts of their course most fre- quently affected are those where they give off large branches, or are exposed by their situation to blows and sudden extremes of tension or relaxation. The aorta at its arch, origin of the coeliac, and its bifurcation, the carotid at its division, the axillary, the external iliac at the groin, and the popliteal, are the most com- mon seats of its occurrence. The first step in the production of this kind of aneurism is the formation of a breach in the iijner coats, through which the blood, being constantly urged by the force of the heart, passes and gradually distends the cellular coat into a bag. The tumouT thus caused must press upon the sur- rounding tissues, and, by its constantly increasing size, effect such a condensation of their textures as will greatly strengthen its parietes. The original breach or crevice can generally be traced either to a blow, sudden extension, and such sorts of injury, or to violent impulse of the heart, attendant upon some severe exertion. It would be difficult for these means to rupture the internal coats of._a,^ound artery, and if they did so, the speedy effusion of lymph would, we have reason to believe, in most cases at least, not only repair the injury, but obliterate the vessel. The artery, therefore, must in general be predisposed to suffer the process that has been described, by undergoing morbid degeneration of the internal coat, which renders it soft, easily torn, and unfit for performing the adhesive action. It has been already stated, that the inner and middle coats, though exten- sively altered in their texture, usually retain a thin membranous film, were it not for which, the frequency of aneurism would doubtless be much greater than it actually is; since in that case there would be no occasion for any particular force to cause the

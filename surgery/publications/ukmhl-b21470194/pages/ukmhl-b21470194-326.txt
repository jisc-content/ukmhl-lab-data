PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 304 With the exception of those cases where some energetic interference is peremptorily required, which are fortunately rare, the best treatment for bronchocele is to bhster the surface, and apply ointments, containing iodide alone, or in combination with mercury. Ever since Dr. Coindet of Geneva introduced the use of this medicine to promote absorption (1820), it has been very generally employed both internally and externally for this purpose, wliile the internal ^^se of burnt sponge, which was formerly considered the grand specific for bronchocele, has gone into disuse since iodine came to be regarded as its active prin- ciple in exciting the action of the absorbents. But for my own part I regard the blisters as productive of nearly if not all the benefit; and therefore use them without any other means or treatment. When the case ceases to improve, or is obstinate from the commencement, the patient should be dissuaded from subjecting himself to any more severe expedients unless his existence should be threatened or rendered seriously uncom- fortable by the presence of the swelling. The headache, which occasionally proves a distressing attendant of the disease, is sometimes much alleviated by the application of a few leeches to the temples from time to time. When the enlargement is found to depend on the presence of a cyst it should be punctured, and injected with tincture of iodine, as in the case of hydrocele.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 300 great oppression in the chest; his cheeks become purple, owing to the imperfect oxygenation of the blood; his extremities are cold; his pulse frequent, small, and irregular; and if proper measures are not employed for his relief, death may ensue from congestion of the sound lung, or from the inflammation which results from this state. In cases of recovery, the wound of the thoracic parietes heals, and then the air which had been admitted into the cavity of the plem-a is absorbed, so that the lung is forced to expand, and performs its function as before the injury. In conducting the treatment of a simple penetrating wound, it should be recollected that the danger consequent upon the injiuy proceeds from inflammation of the pleura, caused by the wound, or by oppression of the sound hmg. The practice thus suggested consists in protecting the patient from aU sources of bodily and mental agitation, and diminishing the quantity of blood in the system so as to lighten the labour of the weakened organ. With these views, the thorax should be surrounded with a broad bandage,—the horizontal posture, and strict antiphlo- gistic regimen, should be enjoined,—and blood should be taken from the arm in quantity proportioned to the strength of the patient, but so largely as to relieve, if not remove altogether, the sense of oppression which is felt about the breast, after whioli antimonials and opiates must be diligently emplo^'^ed to moderate the force of the circulation, supersede the necessity of further depletion, and lessen the risk of excessive reaction from what has been already employed. When a wound of the thorax not only penetrates the cavity, but also extends into the substance of the lung, the consequences are still more important, since, in addition to those that occur in the former case, there are the dangers which attend hemon-hage into the cavity of the pleura, and into the bronchial tubes of the sound lung. The injury is generally recognised by bloody expec- toration, and a discharge of blood or bloody froth from the wound. But it must be recollected, that, though neither of these indications be observable, a wound of the lung may exist, and even be productive of a copious bleeding into the cavity of the cliest.

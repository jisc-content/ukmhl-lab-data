ABDOMEN. 347 freq[ueiitly required iu considerable numbers, inflammation is apt to be excited ; and, secondly, that most troublesome and dan- gerous occurrence, ulceration of the intestine, is apt to happen, probably from the bowel adhering to the wounded part of the omentum, and losing the protection of its serous covering, which is slow to undergo the ulcerative process. Lastly, when the in- testine is discovered by its soft consistence and fetid odour to be iu a mortified state, any attempt at reduction would be highly imprudent, since the patient's only chance of escape from the fatal effusion of its contents into the abdominal cavity depends upon lymph being thrown out and around the mouth of the sac. If this barrier be broken up, death will inevitably happen, and therefore the surgeon should either leave the contents of the hernia as he finds them, or limit his interference to laying the gut freely open, if it is not so already, after which a soft poultice, or pledget of emollient ointment, may be placed on the part. After the operation, unless circumstances should require the wound to be kept open, its edges ought to be drawn together by stitches, and have a thick compress of folded lint supported by a bandage applied over them. When things go on well, the patient experiences relief almost immediately after the operation. The tormenting pain of the umbilical region, the sickness, and the vomiting subside, the warmth of the body becomes uniformly diffused, the anxious ex- pression of the countenance disappears, and a full, soft, mode- rately fr-equent pulse gives further indication of the salutary change that has taken place. In the course of an hour or two, one or more, usually several, copious evacuations of the bowels, shew not only that the gut has been relieved from mechanical obstruction, but that it has been restored to the due performance of its functions. Tenderness of the abdomen, or uneasiness felt in it independently of pressure, will suggest the immediate ap- plication of warm fomentations ; and if it should increase, or be accompanied with acceleration of the pulse, heat of skin, thirst, anxiety, or restlessness, general bleeding and leeching of the abdomen must be resorted to without delay, decidedly and

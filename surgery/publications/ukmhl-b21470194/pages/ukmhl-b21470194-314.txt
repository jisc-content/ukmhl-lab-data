292 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, air-passage, is generally of great extent, stretching from tlie larynx down the trachea into the bronchial tubes, and is so rarely limited within those bounds below which an aperture can be made, that an operation in this case must be regarded as only proper in almost desperate circumstances. (Edema glottidis, though not a very uncommon affection, is now so well Imown to the profession, that any account of its symptoms or progress would here be equally uimecessary and out of place. It. is suffi- cient to observe, that in this case, the obstruction is nearly or altogether confined to the rima glottidis, the lips of which are thickened by infiltration of serous effusion, so as greatly to im- pede inspiration, though they still allow of expiration being per- formed with moderate facility; and that, consequently there is' ample space below for making an opening to admit the air. M, Bayle's judicious observation, however, ought not to be forgotten, tliat if the operation is delayed until the disease has advanced so far as to occasion repeated threatenings of suffocation, it will hardly prove successful, owing to the excessive secretion of mucus which is induced by the continued irritation and dysp- noea. As soon, therefore, as the nature of the patient's com- plaint is distinctly ascertained, he ought to be impressed with the propriety and necessity of having the aperture made without loss of time. Ulceration of the larynx does not often impede respiration, though it deprives the patient of his voice, and occa- sions many other distressing symptoms. But sometimes the breathing in such cases suddenly becomes extremely difficult, and the danger of instant dissolution demands surgical inter- ference, though there may not be the slightest prospect of per- manent recovery, or of any advantage more than a few weeks', or â€¢ even only days', longer existence. The operation may be performed anywhere between the thyroid cartilage and sternum; but convenience and safety limit the choice more narrowly. The space between the th}T?oid and cricoid cartilages, though covered with little besides the integu- ments, and so far favourable for the purpose, is objectionable in general on the ground of its proximity to the disease, and always

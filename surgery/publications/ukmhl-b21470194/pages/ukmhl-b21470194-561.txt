The cavity of the wound shoiild be gently filled with pieces of lint, after "which sutures are to be introduced so as to retain the cut edges in accurate contact. If it is necessary to remove the bone at its articulation, the opera- tion should be conducted as has been described, until the jaw is divided on that side of the tumour where it remains sound. The tumour is then pulled outwards, while its connections with the mouth are detached, and at the same time depressed so as to bring the coronoid process within reach. The attachment of the temporal muscle having been divided, the bone is more fully depressed, so as to expose the articrdation, into which the knife is carried close round the condyle, in order to avoid the internal maxillary artery, which crosses the neck of this process on its inner surface about half an inch below the joint. The remaining connections are lastly divided, and the operation concluded as has been directed. The small amount of deformity or inconvenience of any kind occasioned by the excision of the greater part of the lower jaw, can be conceived only from actual observation, and, as well on this account as the relief afforded to the patient from an oppressive and idtimately fatal disease, the operation may be regarded as one of the greatest improvements in the practice of modern surgery.

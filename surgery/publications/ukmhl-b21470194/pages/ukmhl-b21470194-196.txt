PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 174 CHAPTEE XT. BONES. Fractures. The osseous tissue resembles, in general, tlae other vascular parts of the system as to ,the healthy and morbid actions of its nutritious system, but is remarkably distinguished by its power of reproduction. It is not possible to explain on what this difference depends, but its existence is of great consequence in remedying the accidents to which bones are most exposed by their rigidity—viz., Fracture. Bones may be fractured in three ways—1. By external violence operating directly upon the injured part; 2. By external violence causing a strain upon the bone so as to break it, not where the force is applied, but at some other part of its extent; 3. By inordinate action of the muscles. Fractures result, most frequently from the first and second of these causes, and very rarely from the third. They occur at all periods of life, but are more frequently met with in particular bones at one age than another. In children, the thigh bone, humerus, and clavicle ; in adults, the bones of the leg and fore-arm, the shaft^of the femur, the humeinis, clavicle, and ribs ; and in old people, the neck of the femur, are the bones most liable to be broken. Independently of diseased conditions to be mentioned afterwards, which render the bones more subject to fracture, it would appear that the bones of some individuals are more easily broken than those of others. Fractures may be transverse or oblique in respect to the axis of the bone—they may be single or comminuted—and they may be attended with a wound exposing the bone, or without one, whence they are divided into Compound and Simple.

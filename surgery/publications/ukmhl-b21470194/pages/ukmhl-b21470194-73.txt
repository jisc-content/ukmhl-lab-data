51 GRANULATION. adopt an easier system; and the three following heads will be found to comprehend the whole :— 1. Ulcers which are prevented from healing by defect of action. 2. Ulcers which are prevented from healing by excess of action. 3. Ulcers which are prevented from healing by peculiarity of action. The cii'cumstance which has occasioned the ulcer, the part of the body in which it is situated, or the peculiarities of the patient's system, sometimes at once denote its nature ; but in general this can be learned best by carefully examining the di^ tinctive features that are presented, in respect—1. To the surface^ of the ulcer, which may be level with the surrounding skin, depressed below it, or elevated above it, concave, smooth, or irregular ; 2. The shape of its edges, which may be regularly curved and smooth, or eroded and angular, round or sharp, undermined and inverted, or thick and everted; 3. The quantity or quality of its discharge, which may be purulent, bloody, or serous, thick or thin, copious or scanty, fetid or inodorous; 4. The kind and degree of the pain proceeding from it; 5. The con- dition of the surrounding and subjacent parts, which may be hard or soft, inflamed or natural; and, 6. The mode of its cica- trisation, which may proceed from the circumference to the centre, or from the centre towards the cu'cumference,—on a level with the surrounding surface, elevated above, or depressed below it. Ulcers prevented from Healing ly Defect of A ction. The defect of action has been thought to depend sometimes upon a real want of power, and at others upon a want of dispo- sition to exert the power that exists. The ulcers of this kind have accordingly been divided into Weak, and Indolent or Callous, which exhibit different characters, and requke different treatment. In Weak Ulcers the surface is generally higher than that of

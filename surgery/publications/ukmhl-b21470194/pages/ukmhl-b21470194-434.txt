412 PEINCIPLE3 OF SUEGERY. Frfere Jacques introduced an entirely different method, wliich was to cut freely into the bladder. He commenced his career as a lithotomist, unacquainted with anatomy, and provided with very imperfect instruments,—but nevertheless extracted the stone with such invariable facility and dispatch, that though many of his pa- tients died, and comparatively very few made complete recoveries, he acquired great reputation, and the friendship of some of the most distinguished surgeons in Paris. Through their assistance he supplied the defects of his education, and afterwards operated in various countries with distinguished success. The important truth having thus been ascertained, that the bladder could be cut without any fatal or injurious consequences, the attention of surgeons took a different direction, and a variety of methods and instruments were contrived for cutting the same parts that had been previously torn. It is unnecessary to consider these parti- cularly, as the operation practised and described by Cheselden (1720), though perhaps not differing materially from that of some other surgeons both in this country and abroad, has been gene- rally regarded the standard for imitation. The lateral operation of Cheselden consists in making a free incision of the perineum,—opening the urethra at its membranous part, and continuing the cut through the prostate gland, obliquely outwards and downwards. The simplest mode of effecting this is to use a scalpel, or other knife, that may be under the sur- geon's command; but as it requires an accurate acquaintance with the relative situation of the parts concerned, and consider- able manual dexterity, to divide the prostate safely with such an instrument, various apparatus have been contrived for cutting in the requisite direction, and to a sufficient extent, merely in con- sequence of their form and construction, and without the neces- sity of precise guidance on the part of the sxu'geon. But after a hundred years' experience of such substitutes for operative skiU, it is now almost universally admitted that the simple laufe is by far the safest means for the purpose, and it does not seem neces- sary to enter here into any description of the obsolete procedures which used to occupy so large a portion of systematic surgical

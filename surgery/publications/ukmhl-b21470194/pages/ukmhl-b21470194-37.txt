INFLAMMATION. 15 from beiiig more easily closed. Those at the bend of the arm, the external jugular, and more rarely the veins of the hand and foot, are chosen for venesection. Venesection.—The patient should be placed in a reclining posture, unless the peculiar circumstances of his case should render some other more convenient; a bandage is then to be put twice round the arm, about an inch above where it is proposed to open the vessel, and tied with sufficient force to obstruct the veins without impeding the current of the artery. The surgeon now chooses the largest vein, which is generally the median basilic—puts the limb into such a position as may be preserved while the blood is flowing, and presses the thumb of one hand upon the vessel immediately below where he proposes to punc- ture it, in order to prevent it from rolling, and the blood from escaping until he is ready to receive it; then holding the lancet with the other hand, he introduces it into the vein obliquely, in respect to the direction of the vessel. "When the blood appears, he ceases to push the instrument deeper, but carries it a little further forward, in order to enlarge the opening of the vein; and, lastly, elevates the point, so as to make the external wound of sufficient size. The pressure of the thumb is then removed, and the blood is allowed to flow so long as seems proper. The surgeon, when a sufficient quantity has been abstracted, slackens the bandage—places his thumb upon the orifice—cleanses the arm from blood—lays a small compress of folded lint on the wound—and applies with moderate firmness a single turn of a bandage in the figure of 8. It frequently happens, from the operator making too small a wound, or the opening of the vein ceasing to correspond with that of the skin, that the blood enters the cellular substance, and constitutes a tumour, which is named Thrombus. It produces no inconvenience, further than arresting the flow of blood.; and if from this, or any other cause, the quantity desired cannot be ob- tained, it is better to open another vein, than to run the risk of exciting inflammation in the one already wounded, by introduc- ing probes, or using any other contrivances for assisting the

226 PRINCIPLES OF SUKGERY. generally named, surgeons proceeded formerly in the belief that the primary evil consisted in displacement of one or more of the vertebra from violence; that the pain and loss of voluntary motion depended on pressure caused by the dislocated parts on the spinal marrow; and that the disease of the bones was not only caused, but kept up by, the irritation proceeding from their unnatural position. The practice, therefore, consisted in the use of mechanical contrivances for rectifying the displacement. Tlie inef&cacy and danger of such a mode of proceeding must be obvious to every one acquainted with the true condition of the bones, which having their substance destroyed more or less ex- tensively, though separable by force, must resume their situation as soon as it is removed. And if the vertebrte are much weak- ened, or partially united, they will be very apt to suffer such fracture or disjunction as may render the limbs below perma- nently paralytic, or prove immediately fatal. Mr. Pott, observing that curvature of the spine from rickets, though productive of the most extreme distortion and deformity, was not attended with palsy; and that the palsy accompanying the disease in question did not resemble the state which is in- duced by pressure on the spinal marrow, the muscles of the limbs being not soft and flaccid, but rigid and tense, concluded that the curvature was an effect, and not the cause, of the disease, which he thought might more reasonably be referred to inflam- mation seated in the bodies of the vertebrae, and causing more or less irritation of the neighbouring spinal marrow. With this view of the matter he used counter-irritation by means of issues opened with caustic potash, as early as possible, in order to subdue the inflammatory action, and interdicted the erect postui'e, as increasing the irritation. Mechanical contri- vances do not afford the diseased spine nearly the same repose which is obtained from the horizontal posture, and frequently occasion the greatest mischief, by pressing injuriously on different parts of the trunk, as well as by inducing the patient to indulge in exercises which the diseased spine cannot bear with impunity. There can be no doubt as to the soundness of the principle which

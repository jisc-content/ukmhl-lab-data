PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. 520 should then be passed through the opening, down the duct into the nose. The obstruction having thus been removed, a piece of bougie, or a small metallic instrument named a style, is intro- duced. The style may be made of silver, lead, or any other metal not readily oxidised ; it is suited to the foiTQ of the pas- sage, and has a broad head to prevent it from descending too far. It should be taken out daily, washed, and replaced. So long as it is worn, the patient is relieved from the inconvenience he formerly suffered, but when it is withdrawn, the passage is apt to close again. Trials may be made from time to time, at the interval of six or eight weeks, to ascertain whether or no the foreign body can be dispensed with. When the obstruction is permitted to continue, it sooner or later occasions suppuration of the sac, and the abscess thus formed being opened naturally or artificially, allows the tears to issue on the cheek, in which case there is produced what may be more strictly named a Fistula Laclmjmalis. The neighbouring integuments become thick and red ; the eye is weakened j and the patient suffers so much from the deformity and inconveni- ence resulting from the disease, that he readily submits to the operation required for his relief. This does not differ from the one that has been described for epiphora. It was formerly the custom to apply the actual cautery, through a canula intro- duced into the entrance of the duct, in order.to destroy the diseased parts which were thought to oppose recovery ; but this practice is now obsolete.

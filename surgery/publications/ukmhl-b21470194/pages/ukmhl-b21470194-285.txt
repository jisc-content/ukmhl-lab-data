263 JOINTS. dangerous than ainpiitatiou, because the joint, previous to its performauce, has been opened by the disease ; the whole of the articulating tissues, wliich are apt to suffer violent inflammation when irritated, are either previously destroyed or removed ; the great blood-vessels and nei-ves are not interfered with ; and the patient is not subjected to the shock which is caused by taking away a limb. As to the joints which may be subjected to this operation, it is evident, I think, that the extent to which the acetabulum is almost always affected in the hij)-disease forbids any attempt at excision. Though experience has not yet fully decided whether the limbs that might be preserved by cutting out the knee and ankle joints would be preferable to the artificial substitutes which may be worn in their stead, it seems pretty well ascer- tained that in general they would not. The wrist also, from the number of bones, and complexity of articulations entering into its formation, together with the numerous tendons, arteries, and nerves passing over it, does not seem to be favourable for the operation. But the elbow and shoulder joints, while theix struc- tiu-e and situation are most convenient for excision, hold out the greatest inducements to effect their removal without performing imputation. In all ranks and circumstances of life, the use of the hand is of great consequence ; and even although the elbow or shoulder were to remain stiff and motionless, if the hand could be preserved entire and serviceable by excision of these joints, this would be infinitely preferable to taldng away the limb. But it has been proved by numerous facts, that wliile the â€¢ joints beyond the disease remain as useful as ever, the one which has undergone the operation may regain such a degree of mo- bility and subjection to the action of its muscles as to render it hardly distinguishable from a sound one. There is no new joint, strictly speaking, formed, but a strong fibrous substance unites the extremities of the bones, and by its flexibility allows them to move within proper bounds ; while the muscles obtain new attachments, so as to perform their usual office, and even tlie bones regain somewhat of their original form.

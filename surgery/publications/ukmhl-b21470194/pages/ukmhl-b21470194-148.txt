rillNClPLES OF SURGERY, 126 to constitute the axillary plexus, thougli not lying in the way of the artery, are apt from their proximity to be mistaken for it; wherefore the surgeon should be cautious in passing the ligature, and not tie it until satisfied, by the effect of compressing what he has included, that it is really the artery. Notwithstanding the superiority of this proceeding over those which were previously employed for ligature of the subclavian artery, there can be no doubt that the operation is not merely very difficult, but also very dangerous, since it has been found in the recorded cases of its performance, that fuUy a half of the results were fatal from secondary hemorrhage, deep seated sup- puration, and other bad effects. It would therefore seem better in this situation to prefer the old operation, for which the vessel is very conveniently situated, since, if not found to admit of being tied within the confines of the sac, it may be exposed quite up to the clavicle by dividing the superjacent muscles. That this artery may be safely tied at the seat of rupture, is proved by the facts that I have with perfect success twice amputated at the shoulder joint for axillary aneurism which did not admit of any other remedy, and twice operated by laying open the sac ; while the hemorrhage may be completely prevented by malcing an incision at the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid, so as to admit the finger of an assistant, and allow it to press upon the vessel when it rests on the first rib. Carotid Aneurism. The carotid artery at the angle of the jaw, where it divides into its two great branches, occasionally becomes the seat of aneurism, which is easily recognised by the general characters. Sir A. Cooper first ventured to tie the common carotid for this disease (1805); and though the attempt did not succeed, he re- peated it successfully not long afterwards (1808). Since then the artery has been secured very frequently, on various accounts, and with so little difficulty or bad consequences, that the opera- tion is regarded as one of ordinary interest. The patient should be placed on his back with the head Iom-

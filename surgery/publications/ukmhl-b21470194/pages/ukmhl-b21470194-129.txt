107 BLOOD-VESSELS. obviate this cause of failure various contrivances were employed. The ligatures were sometimes drawn gently, lest they should cut the coats of the vessel, or a little roll of plaster was interposed with the same view between the knot and artery. Ligatures in the form of tapes were employed ; two or three of them were tied at some distance from each other, so as to compress a con- siderable extent of the vessel; and ligatures of reserve, as they were called, being introduced under the artery, beyond those which had been tied, were left loose, so that they might be draAvn tight if occasion should require, l^otwithstanding all these precautions, bleeding still occurred as often as before, and proved, if possible, even more unmanageable. In despair, there- fore, of obstructing arteries safely in this way, attempts were made to obhterate them without inducing the ulcerative absorp- tion which was requisite for the separation of the ligature. Simple compression of the vessel, division of its internal coat, and these two means conjoined, were tried for this purpose, but, as has been already stated, however promising they might appear from their results when practised on the lower animals, they were found to operate very uncertainly on the human arteries. Though these experiments thus did not lead directly to any prac- tical improvement, they occasioned such a series of extensive and accurate observ-ations, as had the happy effect of developing the true principles on which the bleeding caused by ligatures depends, and consequently shewed how it was to be avoided. The great source of danger, was found to proceed from the ulceration which detaches the ligature going beyond due bounds; and it was ascertained that the circumstances most conducive to this, were extensive separation of the artery from its neighbour- ing connections, the interposition of much foreign matter between it and them, or the irregular puckering of the coats by flat or twisted ligatures, also laceration and contusion of the neighbour- ing tissues, caused by exposing the vessel with the fingers or any blunt-pointed instrument, which prevented union by the first intention, and excited inflammation. Such being the case, it naturally followed that the most effectual method of preventing

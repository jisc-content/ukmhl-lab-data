BONES. 207 soft textures, in which it was never supposed that layers existed naturally. He recalled attention to the synthetic experiments of Haller, who, by investigating the formation of bone from the earliest stage to its perfect state, had established the reticulated nature of its texture; and by an opposite process of an analytic kind, which consisted in depriving bones of their earthy consti- tuent by means of diluted acids, and then macerating them for a long while in water, he unravelled the texture so as to shew that it really was reticular. As a consequence of these observa- tions, Scarpa denied that bone could be formed by the peri- osteum ; and this opinion was keenly embraced by several pathologists of the present century, and particularly by the French surgeon Leveill^. " At present, professional opinion is divided in regard to the ossific power of the periosteum, and different sides of the ques- tion are maintained by teachers and writers in this as weU as other schools of medicine. As the point in dispute is not merely a matter of curiosity, but one of great practical importance, it is very desirable that the truth should be ascertained. It wordd detain the Society too long were I to show how the different opinions on this subject may influence the practice of surgery ; and I shall, therefore, proceed to state the considerations which have completely satisfied my own mind, and are, I think, suffi- cient to satisfy any one who is open to conviction, that though Duhamel was misled into many errors by the false analogy which he supposed to exist between wood and bone—in regard to the mode of their natural formation—the periosteum, never- theless, does possess the power of producing new osseous sub- stance in certain conditions of disease. "The well-known and often-repeated experiment of Troja, which consisted in perforating the cavity and destroying the marrow of a bone, so as to kill it and cause the formation of a substitute in the form of a shell surrounding the old one, was devised in imitation of a process which not unfrequently occurs spontaneously in the human body. In this disease, which has been named Necrosis, a portion of the old bone dies, and becomes

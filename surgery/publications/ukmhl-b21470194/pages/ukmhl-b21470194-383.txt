Sometimes the rectum is completely formed, with the exception of having its orifice closed by a thin membrane, which allows the dark colour of the meconium to be discerned through it. This obstruction, instead of existing at the extremity of the gut, may be situated a little above it, so as to require the intro- duction of a finger for its discoveiy. The recti;m is also occasion- ally found to be deficient at its lower part, becoming nearly or altogether impervious at the distance of an inch or more from where the anus ought to be. In such cases, there is not unfre- quently a communication between the intestine above the ob- structed part and the vagina of the female, or the urinary bladder of the male, the former of which complications has sometimes proved sufficient for affording passage from the bowels during the course of a long life. The symptoms of imperforate anus are swelling and tension of the abdomen, vomiting, and absence of the usual evacuations from the bowels. If the child is not relieved by having an aperture effected for the escape of the confined feculent matters, it must speedily perish,â€”and an examination of the rectum should therefore be always instituted without delay, when there are symptoms indicative of obstruction, and more especially when there is no discharge of meconium. Tn case of simple closure, without deficiency of the gut, the membrane should be freely divided in a crucial direction with a

PEINCIPLES OF SUEGEKY CHAPTEE I. INFLAMMATION. INTRODUCTION. With exception of the cuticle and its a^Dpendages, the nails and hairs, all the solid part of the human body is composed of vas- cular tissues, which consist of blood-vessels and nerves interwoven together through a basis of cellular substance. These tissues are everywhere permeated by the blood, which supplies them with nourishment for their growth and renovation. Some of them, as those of which the bones and ligaments are formed, seem to per- form no living action, but that of duly appropriating the nutritious matter thus afforded, so as to preserve their structure in a healthy or perfect state, and this is named their Nutritive Action. Other tissues, as the muscular and glandular, in addition to the power of nutrition, possess various remarkable vital properties, wliich are named their Functions. Both the nutritive and functional actions of the tissues are subject to disorder. When the former are perverted, alteration of the structure necessarily results, as is seen in the growth of tumours or the formation of ulcers ; but the latter may be dis- turbed without any obvious change of this kind, as when the digestion of food or the secretion of urine is imperfectly performed, without any perceptible difference in the stomach or kidney. Derangement of function, however, is most frequently connected B

ABSORPTION, 43 CHAPTEE IV. ABSORPTION. By Absoi-ption is understood an excess in the action of removal over that of deposition by the nutrient vessels. The effect of this is necessarily a diminution in the bulk of the part con- cerned, which may be either of the surface or the substance. Absorption, therefore, is distinguished into superficial or ulcera- tive, and interstitial. It may occur in both situations as a consequence of inflam- mation merely, without reference to the exciting cause; but much more frequently depends upon some peculiarity of local irritation, which either occasions it directly, or indirectly through the intervention of inflammation. The most common exciting causes of absorption are pressure, and the presence of something not naturally existing in the body. It frequently removes fluids effused into the interstices and cavi- ties, and when inadequate to effect this, generally opens a passage for their escape externally, by removing the parietes containing them to such extent as is necessary for effecting an aperture. Foreign bodies which excite more irritation than what is suffi- cient for causing the effusion and organization of lymph around them, very frequently obtain their discharge by a similar process of interstitial absorption. It is important to notice, that, though the pressure or uTitation excited by the foreign matter, one would suppose, must be equal on all sides,â€”the absorbing action always takes place in the direction of the nearest external sur- face, unless an internal one lined with mucous membrane should be very near, when the process proceeds towards it. It is by ulcerative absorption of the surrounding living tissues that sloughs are detached.

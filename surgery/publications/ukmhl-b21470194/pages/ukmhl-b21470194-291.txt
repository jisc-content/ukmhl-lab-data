MUSCLES. 20 9 CHAPTER XITI. MUSCLES. Injuries of Micsdes. The muscular tissue is not by any means prone to diseased action, and in general suffers little irritation from the injuries to which it is subjected. Wounds.â€”An incision m the long direction of a muscle occa- sions very little inconvenience, and the wound heals without any remarkable difference from one confined to the integuments. Biit if the muscular fibres are divided transversely, their con- tractility causes a separation of the sides of the wound, more or less considerable, according to circumstances. No new muscular substance is ever formed to supply the defect, and it conse- quently remains permanent, the intermediate space being occu- pied by a dense fibrous substance. The muscle concerned is for a time rendered weak in action, owing to the relaxation of its fibres ; but in general it gradually becomes accommodated to the change, and acts with its former vigour. In order to prevent this separation of the cut extremities as much as possible, the patient should be made to assume such a position as will most effectually relax the injured muscles. Sutures would have little effect in counteracting the retractile tendency, and it is not thought right to employ them lest they should excite irritation. Punctured wounds of muscles are frequently followed by diffused inflammation and extensive sup- puration ; but these effects are to be ascribed to the form of the wound, and the thick fascia which it generally penetrates before reaching the muscle. In gunshot wounds, and extensive lacera- tion of the muscidar texture, a troublesome degree of swelling is

141 EXTERNAL INJURIES, CHAPTER IX. EXTEENAL INJURIES. Bruises. By a Bruise is understood an injiiry caused by a blow, or violent compression, witliont division of the integuments. Its effects vary according to circumstances, but tlie one most common is Eccbymosis, or tbe injection of blood into the cellular tissue, which occasions more or less swelling, and discoloration of the skin. The blood, after being thus effused, is gradually removed by absorption, diu'ing which the colour of the part passes through various shades of red, green, and yellow. To promote this absorption, some gently stimulating lotion, containing the salts of ammonia, spirits, and vinegar, ought to be applied, together with moderate pressure. It is usual to apply leeches in the treatment of eccbymosis, but as the blood is not contained within its own vessels, and, on the contrary, is extravasated into the cellular texture, bleeding from the surface cannot possibly be of any service, and may even do harm by increasing the weakness which the skin has previously suffered, both from the immediate effect of the injury, and also by its separation from the parts beneath through the bloody effusion, and thus causing sloughing. The blood is sometimes effused in larger quantity, and col- lected in a cavity formed by the torn and distended cellular substance. In this kind of bruise there is usually the same sort of discoloration of the skin as in the former, but the size and fluctuation of the tumour readily distinguish it. This condition is comprehended under the title of eccbymosis ; but it is neces- sary to make a distinction between the two, though doubtless

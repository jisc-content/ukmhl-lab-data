JOINTS. 2G7 thrown upon it by a case in which I found the coracoid process of the scapula and the head of the humerus suffering from disease, while the glenoid cavity was free from it, there being at the same time reason to believe that inordinate contraction of the biceps had been the cause of derangement. As the shoulder-joint is distinguished from all others by its anatomical structure in respect to the long head of the biceps passing through it, the peculiarity of pathological condition in question may therefore with some reason be attributed to this source. \ Elbcno-Joint.—In excision of the elbow-joint, it is necessary to expose the articulation freely, and with this view the integu- ments may be divided, either by a single longitudinal incision—as Mr. Park originally proposed—or in the more complicated form adopted by the Messieurs Moreau, wliich was like the letter H, the transverse cut being from side to side along the upper edge of the olecranon. The latter method is that wliich, until lately, I have employed, and perfoi-med hundreds of times with the most satis- factoiy result. It certainly is the easiest mode of procedure, but the former plan has a decided advantage in regard to the after- treatment, from not being' exposed to the inconvenience which attends the tranverse incision, if it does not heal by the first in- tention, and allow the edges to separate. If, therefore, the cir- cumstances permit its performance, the simple longitudinal incision should be preferred, especially in cases of anchylosis, where there is a great tendency to secondary hemorrhage, and consequently much risk of primary union being prevented. The integuments in either of these ways having been separated • from their subjacent connection, and the ulnar nerve held aside, the olecranon should be removed by the cutting-pliers, and then the lateral ligament at the radial side of the joint having been divided, the knife may be safely passed round the extremity of the humerus, so as to let the saw be applied a little above the tuberosities, after which, the radius and ulna being similarly ex- posed, shoidd have their extremities removed on a line with the lower edge of the coronoid process. Any vessel that requires a ligature should then be tied, and the edges of the wound having

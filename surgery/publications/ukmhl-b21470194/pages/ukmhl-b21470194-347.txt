THORAX. 325 All external and internal remedies have been found quite unavailing in. the treatment of medullary sarcoma, whether in the mamma or elsewhere, and the only mode of affording the patient relief is to out out the morbid structure. To this opera- tion the same objections have been urged as to that for carcinoma, and the same considerations ought to guide the surgeon in de- ciding on the propriety of its performance. If the whole of the diseased parts cannot be taken away, no operation ought to be attempted. If the operation be performed when the morbid process has made a rapid advance—the patient's appearance is xmhealthy—^the confines of the tumour are indistinctly circum- scribed—or when ulceration has taken place, the prognosis will be very unfavourable. If the tumour is of firm consistence— distinctly limited—not adherent—of slow formation—and the patient has a tolerably healthy appearance, the prospect of a durable recovery will be better. The appearances found on dissection also afford important indications in regard to the result. The more soft and bloody the consistence of the tumour is, the more malignant may be regarded the morbid disposition; and the more firm it is, the more fibrous intersecting bands it contains—the more, ia short, it approaches the nature of fibrous sarcoma, the less fear may be entertained of a relapse. Since the two kinds of malignant disease pass into each other by insensible degrees, and, when existing in their distinct forms, present varieties hardly less numerous than the cases in which they occur, any attempt to classify their shades of difference could obviously serve no purpose of practical utility. i.-:-iiif

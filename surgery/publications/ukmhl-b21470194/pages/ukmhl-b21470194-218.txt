PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 196 The crest of the ilium is occasionally broken by falls and blows; the accident is easily recognised, produces no serious consequences, and reqmres merely rest, with a spica bandage. Diastasis or Separation of the Epiphyses. . ' Before the epiphyses are united to their respective shafts, they may suifer separation from them by such violence as, in the adult, would occasion fracture of the bones concerned, or dislocation of their articulating extremities. The sjrmptoms will resemble those which would result from fracture in the same situation, and the treatment does not in any respect require to be different. Bending of the Bones. While the bones are young and jflexible, they sometimes bend instead of breaking, when subjected to forces that would occasion fracture in the adult; or rather give way only par- tially, so that, while altered in form, they still retain some power of resistance. As this accident is not attended with either mobility or crepitus, it is very apt to be overlooked, the distortion of the limb being attributed to swelling of the soft parts, in consequence of the injury. The bones of the fore-arm are most liable to suffer in this way. In order to remove the curvature, and prevent it from permanently deforming and im- peding the use of the limb, it is necessary, without loss of time, to employ force sufficient for straightening the bone. If this is done effectually, subsequent mechanical support will hardly be required ; but if, from delay or undecided measures in the first instance, the bones should remain bent, they ought if possible to be straightened by force, and maintained so by rigid splints. False Joints. Fractured bones sometimes do not unite firmly together, their extremities being connected by a flexible fibrous medium. The most common examples of this occurrence are afforded by the pateUa and neck of the femur ; but there is hardly any of

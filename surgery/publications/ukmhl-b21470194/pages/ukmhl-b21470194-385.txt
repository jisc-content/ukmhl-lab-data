PELVIS. 363 periods. Like stricture of the cesopliagus, it may be caused either by simple contraction, with thickening and induration of the gut, or by morbid degeneration of its constituent tissues, in which case the resulting tumour is usually of a carcinoma- tous nature. The symptoms of simple stricture are painful and imperfect evacuations of the bowels,—the desire to empty the rectum con- tinuing after the most powerful and prolonged efforts of expul- sion,—the discharge of fluid matters with great force, as if from a squirt,—the appearance of the sohd evacuations in the form of slender cylinders or small round masses,—and the admixture of a large quantity of mucus, often bloody, with the feculent excre- tions. The disease generally manifests itself very insidiously, and before long is usually accompanied with a distended state of the abdomen, which is owing partly to retention of the intestinal contents, and partly to a tympanitic condition induced by the irritation. The desire to empty the bowels becomes at length almost incessant, and the frequent attempts which are made to do so being seldom followed by any evacuation except of fluids, there is a risk of erroneously supposing that the patient labours under diarrhcea, and with this view of prescribing astringent or other kinds of constipating medicines, which have a tendency to increase the distension of the intestine. In all cases of doubt, an • examination should be made with the finger, to ascertain positively whether or no there be a stricture. It is generally found about two inches or two inches and a haK distant from the orifice, and very rarely higher up; although some practi- tioners allege that they are able to detect constrictions even in the sigmoid flexure of the colon. But the greatest tact and dexterity cannot insure even a moderate approach to certainty, in exploring the widtli of a canal so capacious and loosely con- nected as the upper part of the rectum, as the coats are extremely apt to be pushed before the point of the bougie, and lead to the belief that there is a stricture when none exists. It is often erroneously supposed that a stricture can be felt about five or six inches up the gut, owing to the resistance caused by the promon-

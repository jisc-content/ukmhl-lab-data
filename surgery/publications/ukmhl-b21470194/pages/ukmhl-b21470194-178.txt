156 PllINCIPLES OF SUliGERY. effect of tlie irritative fever, with very little local appearance of disease. Siace the effects of punctures now mentioned differ from each other very much in kind, and are subject to no less variety in the degree of their severity, while they are aU occasionally produced, so far as can be ascertained, by the same circumstances, it has been inferred that they depend not so much upon a poLsonous influence in the subject dissected, as on peculiar irritability of the individual injured. In regard to the treatment, it may be observedâ€”1. That when punctures occur in suspicious cii-cumstances, they ought to be converted into incisions, sucked, and touched with an escharotic. 2. That persons exposed to such injuries ought to lessen so far as possible, the irritability of their systems. 3. That when the effect is an acute and local inflammation, a free incision through the affected part affords most relief 4, That when the absorb- ents inflame, warm solutions of acetate of lead with opium have the most sootliing influence. 5. That when the lymphatic glands become affected, warm fomentations are the most powerfid means of relieving the patient, which they do either by inducing the inflammation to terminate in resolution, or by hastening suppu- ration if it be inevitable. 6. That when the constitutional distui'bance precedes the local affection, and there are signs of great irritation, scarifications of the inflamed part, followed by hot anodyne fomentations, and accompanied with the internal administration of calomel, opium, and cordials, though they may seldom succeed in curing this most dangerous condition, seem to have more tendency to do so than general bleeding and the antiphlogistic regimen, which by iacreasing the weakness of the patient's system, increase its irritability and render its treat- ment more unmanageable.

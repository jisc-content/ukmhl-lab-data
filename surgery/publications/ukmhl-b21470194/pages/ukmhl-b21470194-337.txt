THOEAX. 315 point Wlien the process is tlius far advanced, a free incision should be made, since it will not then delay the subsequent process of cure, but accelerate it by preventiag extensive ulcera- tion, sloughing, or the formation of sinuses. After the matter has been discharged, a poultice is useful for a few days; and then simple dressing, succeeded by some gently stimulating lotion, may be used to dress the sore until it is completely healed. The chroijic abscess forms insidiously without any observable symptoms of inflammation. It occurs at all periods of life, but is met with most frequently in middle-aged women. The size of the swelling is generally about that of an egg, its contents are usually thin, and it is for the most part deeply seated. The in- teguments being free from redness and tension, while the sub- stance of the gland, except in the neighbourhood of the part affected, where it is condensed and thickened, retains its natural consistence, the abscess is apt to be mistaken for a solid tumour ; and this error is in some cases confirmed by swelling of the axillary glands, which, taking place in consequence of the irrita- tion caused by the collection of fluid ia the mamma, or perhaps altogether independently of it, is regarded as evidence of malig- nant action propagated along the absorbents. The equality of the surface of the tumour when examined through the parts lying over it, the absence of pain when this is done, and the feeling of fluctuation that may then be more or less distinctly perceived, afford in general sufficient grounds for an accurate diagnosis ; and should there remain any doubt as to the nature of the swelling, it may be readily resolved by making a puncture, which will evacuate the fluid if there is any, and will do no harm if there is not, since in that case excision ought to be performed without delay. A free opening should be afforded to the matter, and the sides of the incision must be carefully kept separate to prevent their union, which is very apt to happen owing to the thickness of the parts. This operation is sometimes followed by considerable inflammation and constitutional disturbance, during the continuance of which, fomentations, with poixltices and suit-

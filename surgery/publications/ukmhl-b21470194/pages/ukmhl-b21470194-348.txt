326 rKINClPLES OF SUBGEKY. CHAPTEE XVII. ABDOMEN. Wounds of the Abdomen. Wounds of the abdominal parietes not penetrating the peritoneum require merely the ordinary treatment that is proper for injuries of the class to which they belong. "When the peritoneum is implicated, the wound must be regarded as much more dangerous, since this membrane, like all the others of a serous kind, is very apt to inflame when thus injured. There is seldom much internal hemorrhage in such cases, as the pressure of the viscera, which are contained in the cavity of the abdomen, opposes it. In treating simple penetrating wounds, it is evidently proper,, in the first place, to press back any part of the intestines or omentum that may be protruded through the aperture. This should be done as gently and with as little delay as possible. Great care must be taken, also, that the protrusion is not merely returned under the integuments, without being fairly restored to the abdominal cavity, especially if the wound be "oblique and narrow, as when inflicted by a pointed instrument. In cases of this sort, it has happened that the inner opening of the wound so compressed the intestines or omentum permitted to remain in it, under the erroneous impression that reduction had been com- pletely effected, as to cause fatal inflammation. The surgeon, therefore, should follow the protruded parts with his finger, and not be satisfied wdth their replacement until he feels the point within the peritoneum, enlarging the wound in it, if necessary, by means of a probe-pointed bistouiy. It is more particularly necessaiy to observe tliis precaution when any swelling remains at the seat of injuiy, or tlie protrusion tends to re-appear after

547 NOSE. have been repeatedly performed by Taliacotius, and some of his contemporaries, but has not been adopted in modern surgery. The Indian method is simpler, and better calculated to attain the object in view. It is executed by dissecting from the forehead a flap of skin sufficient for constructing the absent feature. The size and shape requisite for this purpose having been determined by fitting a piece of card or wax into its place, and then expand- ing this upon the forehead, where its extent is defined by marking the skin round it with ink, the flap is detached, with the exception of a narrow slip at its lower part, which is left to supply, it with nourishment, and its edges are connected by stitches to raw surfaces formed where they are required on the face. Tubes are inserted into the nostrils to permit respiration, and a sufficient quantity of lint is introduced to give them the requisite shape. Cloths wet with cold water are then applied to moderate the subsequent action, and promote union by the first intention. This operation, which seems to be of very ancient origin, was first adopted in tliis country by Mr. Carpue. It lias since been frequently j)ractised both at home and abroad, and often with results highly creditable to the dexterity of the operators. But though noses may thus be formed which would not attract attention at a distance, and appear tolerably well in a drawing, where the disparity of colour, surface, and other 'characters are not expressed, it must be admitted, that the sub- stitute is almost always even more disagreeable than the deficiency; and there is good reason for regarding such achieve- ments as more curious than useful, especially as by means of enamel or other suitable compositions, imitations of the lost part may be constructed, which prove more seemly, and much less uncomfortable to the patient.

36 rRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. appears not improbable that some, at least, of the cases in which amputation has been reported as successful, on account of spreading gangrene, were not really of the formidable nature supposed. For although the inflammation induced by a local injury may be extensively diffused over the limb, the mortifi- cation is frequently limited to the part directly concerned—as where the leg has been bruised by the wheel of a waggon—so that if amputation be performed in the early stage of such a case, it may have the appearance of limiting the gangrenous process, which, if left to itself, would probably not have extended any further. But there can be no doubt that, upon some oc- casions, the destructive action, when really spreading, has been prevented from pursuing its fatal course by timely amputation.

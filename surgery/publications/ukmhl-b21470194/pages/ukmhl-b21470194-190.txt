168 PKINCIPLES OF SURGEKY, amputation by flap at the middle or higher part of the leg. There can be no doubt that in these situations the flap method is very- apt to leave a mass of redundant substance, ai^ording no protec- tion to the bone, which, having nothing to cover it except an imperfect cicatrix, is a perpetual source of discomfort and suffer- ing. In order to prevent the risk of such unpleasant occurrences, and also to afford relief from them when they have unfortunately taken place, I think amputation of the leg should always be per- formed on the following principles :— In the first place, it does not seem desirable for any useful purpose to retain a longer stvimp than when the tibia is divided at the distance of an inch below the tuberosity; and as the can- cellated texture of this part is less prone to exfoliation than the dense substance of the shaft, it is therefore improper to operate lower in the limb. Secondly, since a covering of muscle is not essential to the formation of a good stump, as may be seen from the results of amputation at the ankle, and since the attempt to retain a muscular cushion below the Imee is, as has just been mentioned, apt to leave the bone in an exposed state, the opera- tion should be so conducted as to make sure of obtaining a sufficient protection from the integuments. On the whole, I believe, from ample experience, that the following mode of pro- cedure, founded upon these principles, is the most eligible that can be adopted :— A tourniquet having been applied above the knee, two semi- X lunar incisions are to be made through the skin, from side to side of the limb, with their convexities downwards, and their extremi- ties meeting about two inches below the tuberosity of the tibia. The flaps thus formed are then to be detached from their subjacent connections, so as to expose the bones at the distance of an inch below the tuberosity. The muscles are next divided behind about the middle of the extent to which their surface has been exposed, and then on the other side on a level with the line where the saw is to be applied. Allowance having thus been made for the unequal retraction of the anterior and posterior muscles, the surface of flesh and bone presented after the operation is perfectly

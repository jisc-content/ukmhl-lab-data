PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 114 cedematous—the pressure of the tumour induces absoiptiou of the condyles of the femur—and if the disease is left to itself, the aneurism either opens and gives rise to a fatal hemorrhage, or undergoes a natural cure by coagulation and absorption of its contents. It was here that the old operation proved most difficult and appalling; and when we consider the deep situation of the arteiy, the diseased condition of its coats, and their close con- nection to the bone through means of the tendinous sheath of the triceps ; also the large and shapeless cavity, at the bottom of which the vessel was to be secured; the hardly repressible hemorrhage ; and the obstacle occasioned by the vein and nerve lying over the tumour, it does not seem surprising that its results should have been almost uniforndy fatal. Dr. Wilmer of Coven- try states, that at the time he wrote (1780), there was not an instance of its successful performance in this country. The modern operation could hardly have been more practicable for aneurism in this situation, if it had not been for the happy im- provement of John Hunter (1785), who, observing that no large branch rose from the artery for a long way above the tumour, proposed to tie-it on the fore part of the thigh, where it was nearer the surface, and at a greater distance from the disease ; where the operation would be easier, and the coats of the vessel might be expected to remain in a more healthy state. The artery may be tied either before or after it passes under the Sartorius muscle, but more conveniently at the former of these points, being there nearer the surface, and further from the disease. The patient being placed in a reclining posture, with his knee bent and the thigh placed on its outer side, the surgeon should feel with the fingers of his left hand for the triangular hollow which is formed by the meeting of the Sartorius and ad- ductor longus, then stretching the integuments not transversely, but in the long direction of the limb, he should make an incision from two and a half to three and a haK inches long, according to the thickness of the parts, having its lower extremity situated

EFFUSION. 37 CHAPTEE III. EFFUSION. Effmion of Serum. The action or process wliicli is denoted by the expression Effusion, consists in the separation of the serous, or fibrinous portion of the blood, and its discharge into some part of the body. Effusion is not necessarily preceded by inflammation, but is very frequently a consequence of it. It has already been re- marked, that a slight degree of effusion almost always attends inflammation. Serous effusion takes place chiefly into the interstices of the subcutaneous cellular texture, and into the cavities which are lined with serous membranes, as the pleura, or peritoneum, and the joints. In the former situation, it occasions a swelling of the part affected, which, unless inflammation exists, is colourless, and pits on pressure. This is (Edema or Anasarca. It occupies chiefly those parts which are most dependent, especially the inferior extremities and the scrotum, and changes its place with the position of the body. In the serous sacs it constitutes collections of fluid, which are named Dropsies. The fluid, both of oedema and dropsy, generally bears a close resemblance to, or rather seems identical with, the serum of the blood. Sometimes it is more limpid and colourless, tinged with blood or bile, more watery, or loaded with a larger proportion of albumen. Serous effusion is induced in the cellular texture and serous sacs by various circumstances. It is often observed distinctly as a consequence of inflammation, but in this case the serous sacs are chiefly concerned. It very frequently results from the venous

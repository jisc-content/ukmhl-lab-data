230 PIUNCIPLES OF SURGEHY. compressed with the rigid articles of dress wliich are used under the erroneous expectation of improving the shape. The muscles of the hack, therefore, becoming extremely weak, and, indeed, as may be learned by actual examination, almost com- pletely absorbed, are no longer able without an effort to restore the erect position of the spine when bent by the weight of the head and superior extremities, or by the occupation of the patient. It is consequently allowed to assume a permanent curve; and then the predisposition, which depends on a softened state of the bone, acts with full effect; because the more the column bends, the longer levers are afforded to the superincumbent pressure. As the distortion increases, the viscera of the thorax and abdomen are more and more, compressed and displaced, their functions suffer corresponding derangement, and the whole system becoming disordered, the bones, even less properly nourished than before, lose still more of their resisting power. Should the patient unfortunately, during this prociess, fall into the hands of a machine-maker, who attempts to prop up the weak and twisted spine by means of iron frameworks, the morbid alterations which have been described will be accelerated ; for all such contrivances must prove either insupportable to the patient, or inefficient in straightening the spine; and granting even that they could accomplish this, they would still labour under the great objection of confining the movements of the trimk, and preventing the muscles from obtaining 'that exercise which is essential to the recovery of their strength. The result would be not more satis- factory if the practitioner were to go to the opposite extreme, and, regarding the muscles as the sole seat of the disease, attempt to strengthen them by enjoining exercise in the erect posture, or, still worse,, recommending a weight to be carried on the head, in order to render their actions in balancing it more energetic than usual. Such means, however useful in preventing curvature, must manifestly tend to increase it when once commenced. In the management of persons predisposed by their age, sex, temperament, or constitutional make, to this disease, every means ought to be used for strengthening the system in general, and

INFLAMMATION. 17 receive the blood, being held tightly below the aperture, will determine the blood to flow through it; and when a sufficient quantity has been obtained, its further escape will be easily pre- vented by applying a small compress of lint, which should be retained by two crossing shps of adhesive plaster, rather than by a bandage encircling the neck, as this might reinduce the bleeding. Artcriotomy.—The only artery now ever opened intentionally for the abstraction of blood is the temporal. Either its anterior or middle branch may be selected, but the former is the most convenient; and the best part of its course for the purpose is just where it begins to be covered by the hairs of the head, a few of which ought to be shaved off previously to the operation. The artery is sometimes so large and superficial that it may be opened in the same way^ as a vein ; but, in general, this method wordd not succeed, as the* small size and depth of the vessel render it extremely difficult to avoid either cutting its coats entirely across or pricking them slightly, in both of which cases the blood does not flow freely. Many plans have been proposed to obviate tliis difficulty, but the simplest and su.rest is to place the points of the fore and middle fingers over the artery so as to ascertain and mark its course—then to make an oblique incision about half an inch long with a lancet through the integuments over the vessel where it lies between the fingers—and lastly, to introduce the instrument gently again and again nntil the blood springs out. The operation may also be rendered more certain by using a small cupping-glass having an oval aperture fitted to the shape of the temporal region ; even if the artery should have been completely divided, this means will induce the blood to flow from it. To stop the hemorrhage a firm compress of lint should be placed on the wound, and then a bandage a yard or two long, and an inch broad, roUed up at each of its extremities, being applied first to the opposite side of the head, should be brought round and crossed over the arteiy, after which its ends are to be carried back again in the opposite direction, and this repeated until sufficient pressure is effected. 0

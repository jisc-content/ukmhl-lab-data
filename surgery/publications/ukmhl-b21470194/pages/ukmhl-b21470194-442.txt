420 PRINCIPLES OF SUEGERY. procedure was to make an incision in the Mwea alba, about three inches long, extending from the pubis upwards, separate the recti muscles, and open the anterior or pubic side of the bladder, begiiming as near as possible to its neck, and continuing the wound upwards to a sufficient extent, with care to avoid cutting the peritoneum, where reflected on the fundus. The advantages contended for in recommendation of this operation were the facility of its performance, even where the stone was of the largest size, the safety of it in respect to hemorrhage, and the comparatively small degi'ee of pain it occasioned the patient. The objection, however, of urinous infiltration, which was equally obvious in theory and serious in practice, more than coimter- balanced these arguments; and the means contrived for preventing tliis dangerous consequence either proved insufficient, or, by their complexity and irritation, destroyed the great ground of supe- riority contended for. The high operation is now performed by very few surgeons, and will probably soon cease to be practised at all. The Eecto-vesical method was introduced by Vacca and Sanson (1816), and through the influence of their recommenda- tion, together with that of some other surgeons, attracted con- siderable attention for a few years. It consisted in dividing the sphincter ani, rectum, membranous part of the urethra, and prostate, so as to lay the two canals thus far into one, through which the stone could be easily extracted. This was effected by introducing into the bladder a staff grooved on its convex side, cutting through the sphincter and the integuments of the peri- neum, and then conveying in a sharp-pointed curved bistoiuy, which being entered into the groove beyond the prostate, and carried steadily forwards, completed the cutting part of the operation at once. It was contended that the stone could thus be got out very easily, and with hardly more pain than what attends the operation for fistula in ano—that there could be no danger of bleeding incurred—and that the risk of urinous infil- tration, as well as inflammation, would be less than after the lateral operation. The great objection that obviously suggested itself was the probability of a recto-vesical fistula; but the free

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 400 combinations, that give rise to concretions of various kinds. It appears tliat the fluid is sometimes secreted so overburdened with its acid or saline constituents as to deposit them imme- diately on escaping into the pelvis of the kidney, and form con- cretions, consisting by far most frequently of uric acid, but sometimes of the oxalate of lime. If the urine is not so loaded as to free itself immediately after being secreted, it does not afford any deposit so long as it is kept "within the body and maintained at its temperature; but when it is excreted and cooled down to the temperature of the air, it deposits all the redundant portion in the form of a copious muddy yellowish- white precipitate, containing the earthy salts—a lateritious crust, consisting of the acids and acidulous combinations of ammonia. If, however, while such an excess of the urinary constituents exists, a foreign body should be present in the bladder or in any other part of the passage through which the urine flows, so as to serve as a nucleus for concretion, it will, on the well-known principle observed to regulate the separation of salts from their solvents, whether in a crystallised form or not, induce the re- dundant matters to withdraw themselves from the attraction 6f the fluid, and adhere to the surface which is presented to them. This effect, however, can occur only where there is a considerable excess of saline substance, since, when the portion is small, it is retained in solution by the urine, at the high temperature which it has in the bladder, too powerfully to permit its precipitation by the influence of a foreign body. Urinary calculi which have attaiued any considerable size are hence found to consist of con- centric layers, varying in composition and thickness, according to the nature and quantity of the morbid excess that existed in the urine at the time of their formation; and, for the same reason, the rapidity with which they increase in size always bears a direct proportion to the derangement of the urinary secretion. The circumstances which tend to occasion excess in the acid and saline constituents of the urine are chiefly the following :— 1. Imperfect digestion, attended with acidity of stomach; in which case the urine has a deep brownish-red colour, and

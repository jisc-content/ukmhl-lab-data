506 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. Protrusion of the Iris. When an opening is formed in the cornea, either by mecha- nical violence or ulceration, the Iris is apt to protrude through it in the form of a round dark-coloured tumour of variable size, which is extremely sensitive to external impressions, and conse- quently causes great irritation. If the protruded part be cut away, it is replaced by another portion ; it should therefore be removed by caustic, which may be applied every other day. The nitrate of sUver answers best for this purpose; and, by taking off the sensibility of the protruded surface, relieves the patient from pain before the tuniour is destroyed. Dropsy of the Choroid Coat. The Choroid membrane is liable to distension from the ac- cumulation of a dark-coloured fluid, which sometimes contains scales of cholesteriae. The sclerotic and conjunctiva are pro- truded, and becoming thin in consequence of the pressure from within, allow the colour of the fluid to appear through them. The use of the eye is sometimes retained, but frequently lost. If the swelling is small, it need not be interfered withâ€”if large, it may be remedied by repeated punctures. Inflammation of the Retina. In some cases of inflammation of the eye, the Eetina seems to be priucipaUy, if not solely, affected. The patient complains of intense deep-seated pain, accompanied with the false percep- tion of sparks or flashes of fire, while the power of vision is greatly impaired, or altogether susj)ended. In some cases this defect proves permanent, biit in others it disappears, together with the inflammatory symptoms. The most efficient treatment consists in copioiis depletion, both general and local, with active measures for promoting the intestinal secretions.

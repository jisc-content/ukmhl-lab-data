PllINCIPLES OF SUBGEKY, 246 them forwards on the anterior convex part of the articular sur- faces, they may be readily displaced by a lateral impulse, or even by excessive action of the muscles. One or both of the condyles then glide forwards over the root of the zygomatic process ; and sinking into the hollow on the opposite side, retain the jaw fixed in a state of expansion. The reduction of this dislocation is extremely easy, since, if a fulcrum be placed at the back part of the grinding surface, the anterior portion of the jaw affords a powerful lever for replacing the deranged condyle or condyles. The best fulcrum for this pur- pose consists of one or both thumbs, accordingly as the dislocation is single or double, protected from the action of the teeth by being wrapped in the corners of a handkerchief or toweL After the reduction, the patient ought for some time to avoid opening his mouth wide, and exposing his jaw to the circumstances which favour a recurrence of the accident, as a considerable predisposi- tion to it remains. Clavicle.â€”The sternal extremity of the clavicle is sometimes dislocated forwards, in consequence of falls on the shoulder or arm. The displacement is readily recognised by the swelling arising from the projecting end of the bone and superjacent por- tion of the sterno-mastoid muscle, together with the mobility of the clavicle and depression of the shoulder that proceed from it. The dislocation is readily reduced by elevating the shoulder, and pressing down the sternal extremity of the clavicle, but returns so soon as the restraint which produces these effects is removed. A bandage, therefore, sufficient to retain the bone permanently in its proper position, should be applied; and the apparatus best calculated for doing this, consists of a sling to suppl)rt the arm, together with a compress placed on the end of the claAdcle, and secured by means of a figure of 8 bandage. The acromial extremity of the clavicle is also occasionally dislocated; but this accident requires no particular considera- tion, as its causes, symptoms, and treatment, are the same as those of fracture of the acromion, or acromial extremity of the clavicle.

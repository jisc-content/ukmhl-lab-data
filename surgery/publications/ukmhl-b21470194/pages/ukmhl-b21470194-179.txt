157 AMPUTATION. CHAPTEE X. AMPUTATION. The expression Amputation, tliongli sometimes applied to tlie excision of parts from tlie trunk, is generally confined in its meaning to the removal of limhs by the knife. In performing this operation, it is not sufficient merely to cut away what is diseased or injured, since the smface that remains ought to be left in such a state as will favour the healing of the wound, and afford a comfortable stump to the patient. Many different modes of operating have been contrived, with the view of attaining these objects; and there is no department of practical surgery into which more improvements have been introduced in recent times. Amputation was anciently performed by the direct and simple process of cutting down at once to the bone, and sawing it through on a level with the soft parts. But as in this way there was no covering ]provided for the bone, whence followed a tedious and imperfect cure, various modifications were introduced to supply the defect. The muscles were drawn up by metallic plates, or pieces of cloth and leather, called retractors. Cheselden (1720) drew back the skin after it was cut, and then divided the mi;scular parts higher up. This method of double incision was caiTied further by Mr. Mynors of Birmingham, who dissected the skin, and turned it back like the sleeve of a coat. Louis cut the muscles by two circular incisions, so as to divide the portion nearest the bone higher up than the external layer. Alanson, by holding liis knife obliquely, while he made the cu-cular sweep through the muscles, cut them at once in the same form that re- sulted from two successive incisions.

462 PEINeiPLES OF SURGERY. in such cases, but with hardly any perceptible advantage ; and all that can be done by external measures, whether local or general, seems to be to retard the morbid process through the effect of diet and regimen. Excitement of every kind ought to be avoided ; the secretions ought to be carefully maintained; and if any local means are used, .they ought to be of a soothiug kind, such as warm fomentations. The inefficacy of medicine in remedying tumours of the ovaries has led to the trial of surgical operations for their removal. The objections to such a proposal are—1. The uncertainty that must always attend the diagnosis of the disease, which is often very closely simulated by distension of the bowels, thickening of the omentum, enlargement of the liver, and growths from the uterus; 2. The impossibility of ascertaining, before the abdomen is laid open, whether or no the connections of the tumour allow of its removal without the iafliction of a mortal wound; 3. The danger of the operation even in the most favourable cu'cumstances ; and, 4. The difficulty of knowing how long the patient may live if the disease is not interfered with. Notwithstanding these serious obstacles to ovariotomy, and although until comparatively a recent period experience confirmed the worst anticipation of its effects, the operation has now become established in practice. The greater success which has led to this result apjpears attri- butable chiefly to—1. The more accurate discrimination of cases; 2. The use of silver sutures ; 3. The care taken to prevent san- guineous or cystic effusion into the cavity of the peritoneum ; and, 4. The management of the pedicle, especially by attaching it to the lips of the wound.

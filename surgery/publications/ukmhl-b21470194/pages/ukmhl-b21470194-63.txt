41 EFFUSION. does not possess mucli mechanical strength ; and if the lips of the "Wound be torn asunder, they are found to have a coating of coagulable lymph on each of the respective surfaces, precisely similar to that wliich is effused upon serous membranes as a consequence of inflammation. Inflammation, therefore^ used to be considered essential to this mode of union, which was said to be effected by Adhesive Inflammation. It is now ascertained that inflammation, so far from being essential to the process, is subversive of it. A certain degree of excitement is not in- compatible ; but whenever it goes so far as to occasion pain, or much swelling and redness, union by the first intention is frus- trated : and the way is led to another process of reparation here- after to be described, viz., Granulation. Inflammation being thus preventive of primary union, and the interposition of any foreign substance, or the separation of the cut surfaces, beyond the extent to which they can be glued together by the thin layer of lymph effused from each, being of course no less adverse to the process, it follows that the plan which used to be followed in dressing wounds should be re- garded as equally injudicious and injurious. It consisted in closing them immediately, or soon after their infliction, and retaining their Kps in accurate contact by adhesive plasters, or other means, pledgets of ointment and bandages being applied— and no change made in the dressing till the foui'th day. The consequences were that the blood and serum being confined, the edges of the wound were separated from each other ; and the stimulus of necessity, as John Hunter called it, or irritation pro- duced by the continuance of a breach in the structure of the body, which, if primary union had occurred, would have ceased to exist, caused inflammation as the first step to the other mode of reparation already mentioned. Two insuperable obstacles, either of which would have been sufficient for the purpose, were thus placed in the way of direct adhesion—viz., separation of the raw surfaces, and inflammatory action; and when the wound was at length undressed, instead of being united, it was found distended into a cavity filled with matter.

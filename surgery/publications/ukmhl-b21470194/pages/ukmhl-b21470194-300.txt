I'lUNClPLES OF SURGEliY. 278 closed, the other ceases to squint; bat, if the eyelids are then suddenly opened, the eye, however straight it may ordinarily be, is found completely inverted or everted, just as the squinting one was previously. From this very curious fact it would appear that the complaint depends upon an alteration, not in the texture or length of the muscle, but in its disposition to contract, or rather in the disposition to contract possessed by the two corre- sponding muscles, and consequently, that if advantage is to be derived from division of the muscle, that of either the straight or the squinting eye may be subjected to the operation. Another inference of practical value is, that in cases where complete relief has not been afforded by cutting the rectus of the squint- ing eye, the corresponding muscle of the other eye may be divided with advantage. In confirmation of the derangement depending rather upon functional than organic alteration, it may be added, that most persons labouring under the complaint re- mark that it varies in degree with a variety of circumstances, but especially disturbance of the digestive organs. A priori, there- fore, it might have been expected that division of the recti would^ not afford complete, or, at all events, permanent relief, since, iT the tendency to contraction remained, it would reinduce obliquity so soon as the muscle acquired new attachments to the sclerotic, just as has been ascertained to happen in the spasmodic form of wry-neck. Experience, however, having happily ascertained that the operation does in general prove effectual, the theoretical ob- jection must not stand in the way of its employment; but may account for the failures as well as relapses occasionally met with, and afford encouragement to repeat the ^ivision when it does not give all the relief desired at once. The operation essentially requires an opening of the conjunc- tiva sufficiently extensive to expose the insertion of the rectus in fault, and a complete division of the muscle at this part. Various methods have been recommended for effecting this, by the use of hooks for catching the muscle as it lies in the loose texture of the orbit; but the procedure consisting in a simple secure dissection of the part, without any hap-hazard diving, has always seemed to

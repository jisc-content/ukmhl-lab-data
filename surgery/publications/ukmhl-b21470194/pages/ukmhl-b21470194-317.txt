295 THROAT. and the danger of suffocation, continued irritation, or suppura- tion of the lungs, fully warrants recourse to tracheotomy. When the operation is performed with this view, it should be conducted in the same way that has been described, with the ex- ception that, instead of a tube being introduced into the trachea, the edges of the opening are held asunder by a couple of hooks, until the source of irritation is expelled by the forcible stream of air which it occasions. Should the bit of bone, pea, nut, or whatever may have entered, not appear at the orifice, a pair of curved forceps may be introduced upwards to search the larynx, and, if necessary, the cricoid cartilage should be divided to afford more room for this purpose. The forceps may also be directed downwards if there is reason to suspect that the foreign body is impacted in one of the bronchi, of wliich the right one, as being the larger, and more directly in the course of the trachea, will be more likely to contain it. In cases of urgency, either from the presence of a foreign body, or sudden swelling of the parts concerned, though the proper apparatus for performing tracheotomy cannot be procured, the patient should not be permitted to die of suffocation. A penlmife being thrust into the space between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, as near as possible to the former, and carried down so as to divide the latter, will afford a sufficient aperture, the edges of which may be kept apart by a thin bit of wood, or the expanded branches of a small pair of forceps. Removal of Foreign Bodies from the Pharynx and (Esophagus. The detention of matters, in passing from the mouth towards the stomach, is owing either to their size or their figure. If pre- vented from descending on account of their bulk merely, they are generally arrested at tlie commencement of the oesophagus, just behind the cricoid cartQage,—since, this being the narrowest part of the tube, if not impacted more or less firmly into its orifice, they are expeUed either upwards or downwards, by the contractile action of the pharynx,—and if fairly introduced into

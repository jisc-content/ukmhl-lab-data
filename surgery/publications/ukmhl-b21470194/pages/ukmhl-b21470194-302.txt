280 rRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. CHAPTEE XIV. TENDONS. Injuries of the Tendons. Wounds.â€”Tendons are sometimes divided by cutting-instru- ments, the immediate consequence of wliicli is loss of power of the muscles concerned. It was formerly the custom to sew the cut surfaces of the tendon together; but this practice is now abandoned, and the only means employed in addition to those which the wound of the integuments requires, consists in careful attention to the position of the limb, in order to relax the muscle connected with the injured tendon, and prevent as much as possible the separation of its extremities. When the tendon is of large size, such as the tendo A chillis, lateral compresses are useful in keeping the surfaces opposed to each other. It is ascertained that though the extremities remain considerably dis- tant, they are still united together through the medium of a new- formed substance, the result of an interstitial process of reproduc- tion. This part is sometimes thinner, sometimes thicker, than the original tendon, but always inconvenient by causing relaxation of the muscle, and consequent diminution in the effect of its con- tractile power. The surgeon, therefore, should do everything in his power to render the bond of union as^arrow as possible. In cases where the wound has been allowed to heal, with such sepa- ration of the extremities of the tendon as renders the patient lame, it may be warrantable to cut out the intermediate sub- stance, and sew the ends of the tendon together, as I once did with success in. a case where the tendo Achillis had been divided and allowed to heal with great retraction.* * Ed.

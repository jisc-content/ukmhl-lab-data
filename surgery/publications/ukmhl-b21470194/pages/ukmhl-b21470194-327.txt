THORAX. 305 CHAPTER XVI. THOEAX. Wounds of the Thorax. SUPEEFICIAL wounds of the thorax which do not penetrate the cavity require merely ordinary treatment. Muscular bruises occur very frequently, and often occasion so much uneasiness in res^Di- ration as to simulate inflammation, and induce the practitioner to employ copious and repeated depletion, which can do no good, and may prove very hurtful by inducing the spnptoms of exces- sive reaction. The state of the pulse in such cases, if attended to, will prevent this injudicious practice, instead of which the injiu'ed muscles should be restrained from motion by encircling the chest with a broad bandage. Penetrating wounds are attended with various important effects, the mode of production and treatment of which should be familiar to the practitioner, who on such occasions is called upon to act without delay on the knowledge he happens to possess. If air be admitted through the aperture, as it must almost necessarily be to a more or less extent, the lung of the side affected, unless adherent to the parietes of the cavity, contracts itself, owing to the elasticity of the pulmonary tissue, which is thus placed in equilibrio as to the pressiu^e of the atmosphere. If only a small quantity of air has been allowed to enter before the woimd is closed, the contraction of the lung will be pro- portionally inconsiderable. But if the wound remains open unto, the contractile tendency of the lung exerts its full effect, respiration, so far as that half of the pulmonary apparatus is con- cerned, will be completely suspended. The patient then feels X

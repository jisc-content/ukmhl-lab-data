PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 294 respiration, which renders tlie operation necessary, impedes the venous blood in returning to the heart, the surgeon should not delay opening the trachea on account of dark-coloured bleeding. A violent access of coughing follows the introduction of the tube, which is useful in ejecting the acciimulated mucus, and any blood that may have entered; but the patient soon becomes accustomed to the unusual irritation, and respiration is performed without any uneasiness. The viscid tenacious mucus, which is usually secreted very copiously in cases requiring the operation, is apt to obstruct the tube, whence the necessity of employing one at first of a larger size than would be sufficient merely to admit the air, and of clearing it from time to time by means of a probe wrapped round with lint. The tube must be retained in its place by means of tapes passed through rings at its mouth, and tied behind the neck. It should be taken out and washed daily, as long as there continues to be occasion for its use; and it will be prudent to cover the orifice with gauze, to prevent the entrance of injurious matters from without. Foreign bodies are veiy seldom admitted through the rima glottidis; but as the accident, when it does occur, is attended with very distressing and dangerous consequences, great care ought to be taken lest it be overlooked. When it is learned that the patient, while in his ordinary health, in performing the action of deglutition, or, if a child, in playing with some small foreign body in liis mouth, was all at once seized with a violent cough, which has continued to recur in paroxysms with variable intervals, although no other symptom of local inflammation or constitutional disturbance can be perceived, the presumption will be strong that this accident has happened ; and if the sensa- tion of something moving in the trachea should also be felt, there can remain little room for doubting that a foreign sub- stance has entered the air passage. If it is of heavy material, as a piece of money, relief may be obtained by inverting the body. It has also occasionally happened that a violent cough proved the means of cure by ejecting the foreign body through the glottis, but no reliance can be placed on this rare chance ;

When the curvature begins to diminish, the patient may rise occasionally for a few minutes, and exercise the muscles by some suitable employment, which ought never to be continued after the slightest feeling of fatigue is experienced. By persist- ing in this system, the disease will certainly be arrested in its course; the distortion, if not very great, will be removed; and the worst cases will be considerably improved.

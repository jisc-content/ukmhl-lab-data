By Diseased Nutrition is understood an action of tlie capillary ^ vessels, which, instead of preserving the tissue concerned in a natural condition, increases its size or alters its texture. The morbid gi-owths thus resulting constitute the principal division of a most important class of surgical diseases, which are named Tumours. The term tumour implies enlargement of a part of the body beyond its natural dimensions, which may be owing to the effusion or accumulation of fluids, as in hydrocele ; the displace- ment of organs, as in hernia; or morbid growths, as in wens. Morbid growths include simple enlargements of the natural tissues, such as exostosis,—conversion of them into textures foreign to the healthy constitution of the body, such as cancer of the breast,—and the development of entirely new formations, such as fibrous tumours. Mr. Abemethy used the term tumour as synonymous with morbid growth, and restricted its appli- cation "to such swellings as arise from some new production, which made no part of the original composition of the body." As this would exclude many important enlargements of natural tissues which constitute tumours very deserving of attention, the more comprehensive definition that has just been stated seems to be j)referable. Morbid growths occur in almost every part of the body, but the glands and subcutaneous tissue are their most frequent seats. They are very variable in the rapidity and extent of their increase, but, generally speaking, grow quickly in proportion to their size ; and other things being equal, usually enlarge most vigorously

PELVIS. 389 ciilar details I may refer to these sources of inforroation, it being sufl&cient at present to render the principles of practice distinctly- intelligible. It is well known that there are certain textures, healthy as well as morbid, which cannot be expanded without pain and the risk of inflammation, but may be divided by incision with ease and safety. Spasmodic stricture of the anus, and the ring at the base of the prostate, which cannot be torn without the produc- tion of fatal effects, afford examples of this kind, and illustrate the advantage of cutting, under certain circumstances, instead of dilatation. In strictures of the urethra which exhibit the irri- table and rmyielding or resilient characters, it therefore seems reasonable to expect advantage from dividing them freely by means of a cutting instrument, instead of j)ersevering in vain and hazardous efforts to dilate the contracted part by bougies. At- tempts to accomplish this, 'by introducing sheathed blades into the canal, and also by cutting from without upon the point of an instrument carried down to the seat of obstruction, had been frequently made with a different view, viz., overcoming resist- ance, which was supposed to render the canal impermeable, but with very unsatisfactory results, from imperfect attainment of the object, extravasation of urine, and hemorrhage caused through the want of a safe guide for the knife. In the operation which I proposed, the first and essential step was to introduce a grooved director fairly through the stricture, so that complete division of the whole thickened texture might be effected with certainty, and with security from any lateral aberration, endangering the artery of the bulb or other arterial branches, the mesial plane of the perineum, which corresponds with the raphe, being free from vessels of the slightest consequence. But if stricture were frequently impermeable, this method must have been limited in its employment, and incapable of affording rehef in those cases which chiefly required it; and, therefore, so long back as 1844,1 expressed my persuasion that no stricture was truly impermeable, the exit of water being a certain sign that instruments might, through sufficient care, be

307 THORAX. The same objects of treatment exist here as in the case of a simple penetrating wound, hut should lead to a practice still more decided and careful, as the danger must always be regarded as more serious. The circumstance of internal hemorrhage de- mands additional consideration, and has afforded fruitful subject of discussion in respect to the mode of preventing and remedying it, and also as to the diagnostic marks of its presence. Some recommend the external wound to be closed immediately, in order to retain the blood, and limit the extent of its effusion by effecting pressure on the breach of the lung. It is true that the fluid thus accumulated may be removed by subsequent absorp- tion, without causing any trouble to the patient; but experience has ascertained, that, instead of this salutary process, the irrita- tion of its presence is more apt to excite a fatal inflammation, and there seems little inducement to incur this risk when the alleged advantage of the practice is fairly weighed. When the lung is wounded it must suffer a complete contraction, since the air, though not allowed to enter by the external wound in suffi- cient quantity to occupy the space required for its entire collapse, will find a ready entrance from the branches of the trachea which are wounded; and the external surface of the Itmg being thus maintained permanently in equilibrio with the internal one as to the pressure of the atmosphere, the elasticity of the organ will meet with no obstacle to the exercise of its contractile tendency. The cavity for the reception of the blood must therefore be very capacious; and when the yielding nature of its parietes towards the diaphragm and the other side of the chest is taken into account, it seems dif&cult to conceive the possibility of making effectual pressure on the cut surface of the lung by retaining the flui d. For these reasons, it appears to be the more prudent practice to afibrd free exit to the blood, by keeping the original wound open, or making a new one in a more convenient situation, while by bleeding from the arm, and the other means that promote the cessation of hemorrhage by inducing coagulation in the wounded vessels, the further flow of blood from the lung is restrained.

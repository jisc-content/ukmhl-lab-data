PRINCIPLES OF SURGEKY. 288 crossing bands, from organization of effused lymph.. The bursa over the patella is very often distended with fluid, and thickened so as to constitute what is called Ganglion of the Knee. It is met with most frequently in persons whose occupation leads them often to rest their weight upon the laiee. The bursa over the ball of the great toe, when irritated by the pressure of a tight shoe, lays the foundation of that painful and unseemly swelling named Bunion. The parts adjacent become thickened and in- durated ; the bones of the joint enlarge, and in process of time suffer a sort of subluxation ; and the bursa being thus projected more and more against the shoe, is kept in a state of continual excitement. Dropsical effusion, thickening of the membrane, and suppuration with obstinate sinuses may ensue. It is there- fore proper, by the timely application of leecbes or lotions, and the removal of pressure, to subdue tbe disease in its infancy. Though the deep-seated bursas have long been well known to anatomists, and regarded by surgeons as the seat of morbid derangements, those wliich. lie superficially under the integu- ments are of comparatively late observation, and the swellings, as well as other local affections which proceed from their diseased condition, have been ascribed to entirely new forma- tions. In club-foot, for instance, the bursal sac, which in some measure protects the malleolus exicrnus when the weight of the body rests upon it, is not, as has been alleged, a production entirely the result of circumstances, but merely tbe development of a structure naturally belonging to this part. The superficial bursas seated over the joints of the fingei's and toes, of which views are given in the work of Schreger, though almost wholly overlooked, deserve great attention in consideration of the effects which attend their injuries and diseases.

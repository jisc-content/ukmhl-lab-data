GENITAL OKGANS. 435 persons suffer most from mercury wlio are least readily salivated by it, A fearful system of scientific quackery has, in recent times, been founded upon the ruins of the old mercurial delusion, and although the so-called " modified use of mercury," which is at present so much the fashion in Paris and elsewhere, may not be so speedy in its effect, I can testify, from what has frequently fallen under my observation, that it empties the pocket and injures the health no less effectually than the process of poison- ing which it professes to have so advantageously superseded. In cases where mischief has been done by the administration of mercury, it is sometimes necessary to employ an antidote, and for this purpose the iodide of potassium, in small doses, has ren- dered the most valuable service. The preparations of sarsapa- rUla are also much employed to counteract the effect of mercury, as well as syphilis; and the faith in their eificacy is so firmly established, that any expression of my belief that they are utterly inert could hardly excite doubt except iu the minds of those who have witnessed my hospital practice, throughout the whole course of which not a grain of sarsaparilla has ever been prescribed. The local treatment must be varied according to the circum- stances of the case. In the first rustance, as soon as possible after the appearance of the disease, it is proper to destroy the morbid action of the part by touching it with the nitrate of silver ; and then the black-wash, or a solution of sulphate of copper, containing two grains in an ounce, may be applied on a piece of lint. If the orifice of the prepuce is contracted so as to prevent it from being drawn back, the black-wash should be injected four or five times a day, which is better than laying open the foreskin, as the cut surface is sure to take on a simUar action with that of the ulcers, and thus prolong the cure. When the sore has a phagedenic character, a bread and milk poultice is generally the most useful application in the first instance, for a few days, and then a strong solution" of sulphate of copper, containing a scruple to the oimce, used merely to' moisten the

358 PKINCIPLES or SURGERY. Incarcerated and strangulated umbilical hernia should be treated on the same priaciples as those which have been ex- plained. When the operation is judged requisite, a crucial in- cision should be made through the integuments, having the most prominent part of the tumour for its centre, unless the hernia is very large, when it will be sufiicient to make a simple incision two or three inches long, at the base of the swelling, directed towards the centre. The sac is to be exposed and opened in the same way that has been abeady described, and the stricture may be divided on any side, or, what is better, on several sides, so that no one is cut very extensively. The omentum is in this situation apt to cover the viscera, and ought to be carefully dis- engaged from them before being either cut away or reduced. Ventral Hernia. Wliat has been said regarding umbilical hernia mil apply in all respects to ventral hernia, with the exception, that, as the disease is almost exclusively confined to adults, some powerful means of compression are reqrdred. Protrusions of this kind are, not common, and when they do occur, are generally situated in the linea alba near the umbilicus; but the records of surgery shew, that they may take place in almost every part of the abdominal parietes. Hernia Dorsalis, or through the Ischiatic Notch, Hernia of the Foramen Ovale, and Hernia of the Perineum, are so ex- tremely rare that it does not seem necessary to detail the par- ticulars of the few cases in which they have been observed. In a case of perineal hernia that came tmder my notice, the patient, a middle-aged female, made a narrow escape, from having the tumour opened instead of an abscess. The swell- ing was larger than a turkey's egg, and lay between the anus ^ and tuberosity of the reqfam. ^ (clit-fvUvvw ) 1 ./a^a^u f rt>'t' / â€¢ Internal Hernia.

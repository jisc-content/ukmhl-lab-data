74 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. removal by evulsion, ligature, or excision. The expression poly- pus, like that of wart, is often loosely and inaccurately employed to denote growths of a totally different character, merely from their occupying the same situation. Adenoid Sarcoma. Under this title may be comprehended growths resembling secre^ing glands in their structure, but varying in density from that named Fibrous by anatomists, to the softer consistence of some glandular textures, as that of the pancreas. They usually possess a nodulated, or what mineralogists caU. a botiygidal sur- face, and a compact homogeReous consistence, with the exception of small cells, variable in size and number; they are of a yellowish or gray colour ; and are enclosed in . a capsulg, which separates them from the surrounding parts. They are met with in all parts of the body, but occur most frequently in t^e vicinity of the parotid and mammary glands, which they compress, and thus cause to be diminished by absorption, so as at last sometimes to occupy their place, and appear to superficial observers a morbid degeneration of the glands themselves. They are seldom attended with any inconvenience except what their size occasions, but occasionally become the seat of uneasy sensations ; they are not prone to any other. action than that of their own nutrition; and after attaining a certain magnitude, remain stationary, but in the course of time are apt to assume a more troublesome disposition. The only ef&cient treatment is removal by the knife, and this in general may be easily done. The incision should be made freely through the integuments, and fairly down to the substance of the tumour; and in detaching the cellular connections, the knife should be directed upon the surface of the growth, since it may be cut with impunity, while the neighbouring parts by doing so are protected from injury. A dipose Sarcoma. One of the most common solid tumours is that which has

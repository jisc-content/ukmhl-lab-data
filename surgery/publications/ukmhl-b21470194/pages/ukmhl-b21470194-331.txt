309 THOEAX. The second is a wound of the lungs and fUwra costalis, existing without any outlet through the parietes of the chest, which may- be caused by the spicular extremity of a fractured rib, or may result from the healing of the skin while the breach in the lung and pleura remains open, in a case where both the parietes and limg have been wounded. When the air enters the cellular substance, it diffuses itself more or less extensively, and occa- sions a flat undefined swelling of the integuments, which is recognised by a crepitating or crackling sensation, that is felt on pressing it, and by the quick disappearance of dimples thus occasioned in its surface. The integuments of the whole body, except where the subjacent connections of the skin are very firm, as the pahns of the hands and soles of the feet, may be distended in this way; but universal emphysema is an extremely rare occurrence, its extent being usually limited to the side of the chest which has been injured. The treatment is simple and obvious, consisting in the application of a. .compress over the wounded part, to oppose the further issue of air from the cavity of the pleura, and, if necessary, in making punctures at different places, to discharge that which is contained in the cellular sub- stance ; but this should not be done unless the swelling is so great as to be productive of much inconvenience, since, if left to itself, it wiU soon be removed by absorption. Accumulation and confinement of air in the cavity of the pleura, or pneumothorax, as it is called, though less obvious to sight than emphysema, is a more distressing and dangerous occurrence. It gradually distends the membrane in which it is enclosed,—presses upon the pericardium and sound lung,—and may at length occupy so much of the thoracic cavity as not to leave sufficient space for the Iting of the sound side to perform its fimction. In this case, as has been already remarked, the air may either enter by an external wound, which is of such a valvular kind as to allow of its getting in when the chest is expanded during inspiration, but prevents its exit when the parietes of the cavity are drawn together during expiration ; or may pass into the pleura by a wound of the lung which exists

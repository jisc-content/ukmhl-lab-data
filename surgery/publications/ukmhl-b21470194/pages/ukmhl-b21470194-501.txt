BRAIN. 479 antimony ointment, or the actual cautery, then often proves ex- tremely useful; while warm bathing, with friction, and attempts at exercise, are diligently used to excite the languid energies of the limbs. The vertebrae are liable to dislocation and fracture, but never suffer in either of these ways without the operation of extreme violence, except in the cervical region, where the parts con- cerned are least firmly constructed, and sometimes suffer dis- placement from a degree of force not so very great. Dislocation seldom occurs unaccompanied by fracture; and the medullary cord is almost always much injured at the time, independently of the pressure apt to be permanently caused on it by the dis- jointed or broken vertebrae. The symptoms resulting from such injuries are nearly the same as those of simple concussion or compression, and the distiiiction between them depends on the former being generally more severe, as well as obstinate, but chiefly in the alteration of shape which is discovered in the spinal column. It has been stated that dislocation of the spine always terminates fatally, either in the first instance, or in the course of a few months, owing to the chronic inflammation, and alteration of structure occasioned by the injury ; but this is not altogether correct, since recoveries in such circumstances do take â€¢place, though certainly very rarely. The prognosis, therefore, must be unfavourable. The treatment does not admit of replacement of the dislo- cated surfaces through the agency of external means, and the removal of portions of bone by operation to facilitate reduction, though it has been attempted, offers no reasonable prospect of benefiting the patient, while it must increase the danger of bad consequences by adding to the irritation. The vertebral canal is so much wider than the nervous cord which it contains, that a mere alteration of its direction, even though pretty acute, could hardly produce any very important effect on the functions of the organ; and if the displacement were so great as to make the bones press injuriously upon it, there is every reason to suppose, that taking away the portions of vertebrte concerned, even grant-

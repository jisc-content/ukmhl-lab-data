PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 162 surface, the cartilage of wliicli was thought to exfoliate necessarily so as to render the cure more tedious and troublesome. Disarti- culation was therefore avoided as much as possible, and when, from any circumstance, it appeared necessary, the precaution was taken of scraping off the cartilage. It is now well ascertained that union by the first intention generally occurs as readily after disarticulation as after amputation through the shafts of bones, and that when it does not take place, the only inconvenience ex- perienced from the cartilage is a little increase and longer con- tinuance of the discharge. Such being the case, though it would be wrong to amputate through a joint by preference, still, when there is any lasting advantage to be gained by doing so, the chance of bad consequences, so trivial, ought not to be regarded as a sufficient objection to it. "When the distal phalanx alone of a finger ds affected, it ought to be removed by cutting into the joint on the dorsal surface, dividing the lateral ligaments, and then carrying the knife for- wards parallel with the palmar surface of the bone so as to save a flap to cover the stump : or the operation may be reversed by transfixing the finger, while its palmar surface is turned upAvards, forming the flap, and then cutting through the joint. "VNTien the finger requires to be amputated above this joint, the operation should be performed by making two semilunar incisions, one on each side, or above and below, so as to form two flaps, which being dissected back will expose the bone, and allow it to be divided by the cutting-pUers. The flaps are then made to meet together over the face of the stump. The second phalanx might be removed at the joint in the same way as the first; but as the portion of finger thus left would be neither useful nor seemly, it is better, unless the patient refuses his consent, to take away the whole of it at its metacarpal articulation. In doing this, while the other fingers are held aside, the surgeon should place the point of his knife exactly over the summit of the joint, and cut first on one side and then on the other, obliquely into the palm of the hand to the point opposite that from which he set out, taking care to keep exactly in the angle formed by tlie integu-

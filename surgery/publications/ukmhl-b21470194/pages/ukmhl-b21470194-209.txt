BONES. 187 tead of the tibia may by its pressure assist in keeping the condyles even, and applying lateral compresses with a bandage. The tliigh-bone is much more frequently fractured through the trochanters and neck, iu consequence, generally, of falls on the side. In persons beyond the age of sixty, the neck is broken by a slight degree of force, and may give way alone ; but it often happens also that the trochanters are split, while the neck remains entire, and is driven into the thick mass of bone at its root like a wedge. The symptoms of fracture in both of these situations are pretty much the same; the limb is shortened from one to two inches, the toes are everted by the weight of the limb, and by the action of the muscles which perform rotation outwards, as their attachments to the troclianter major remain, while the usual resistance to their operation is removed by the fracture. When rotation is performed, the trochanter major may be felt moving as if on its own axis, instead of describing the arc of a circle, as it does when the neck is entire ; the shortening of the | limb readily yields to moderate extension, and returns when it is / discontinued, during which movements an obscure crepitus is generally perceived. It would appear from some cases that if the fracture splits the trochanters, so as to detach the smaller one from the shaft, and also the posterior part of the greater, to which the muscles that perform rotation outwards are attached, leaving the anterior portion of the process which receives the insertion of the glutoius â–  ynedius connected with the body of the bone, the eversion of the limb is prevented, and the toes are turned inwards, but in other respects the symptoms are the same. The discrimination between fracture of the neck alone, and that extending through the trochanters, is not easily accomplished with accuracy. When the patient is not very old, when the short- ening of the limb is considerable, and when the trochanter feels, on examination, larger than usual, it may be suspected that the injury is not confined to the neck of the bone. This distinction is of little consequence, except in respect to the prognosis, since the treatment proper for both accidents is the same; but recovery

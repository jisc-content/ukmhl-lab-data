Children frequently introduce small bodies, such as i^eas or cherry-stones, into the nostrils, where they are sometimes de- tained in consequence of the enlargement which they suffer, the swelling that takes place in the parietes of the cavity, or simply from their being pushed in with greater force than can be ap- plied from within for their expulsion. The immediate incon- venience is seldom considerable, and the presence of the foreign body often escapes observation for a long while. Sooner or later a purulent discharge and ulceration are induced, and it may happen that surgical assistance is required on account of these symptoms months after the body has been introduced, and when its existence is not known, either from having never been discovered, or from having been completely forgotten. In all cases, therefore, of matter being discharged from one nostril of a child, the surgeon should search the cavity to ascertain if it con- tains any foreign substance. This is most effectually done by means of forceps with narrow blades terminating in small pro- jecting points. They should be introduced with the branches fully expanded, and held in a vertical direction, parallel with the septum of the nose. From the flattened shape of the nostril they may thus be passed behind any body, however firmly im- pacted in it, and, after being fairly introduced, they should be closed so as to seize anything that may be present. One or two trials conducted in this way will enable the surgeon to satisfy hiuiseK whether or no there is a foreign body lodged in the cavity, and to extract it if detected. When the extraneous sub-

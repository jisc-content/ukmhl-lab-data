356 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. been explained in regard to inguinal hernia. It may here not be improper again to notice the question, whether, in operating for hernia, it would not be better to relieve the stricture without cutting into the cavity of the peritoneum. The advantage con- tended for in favoiir of the latter practice is its lessening the risk of inflammatory consequences. In opposition to it many strong objections will readily appearâ€”as, in the first place, the difficulty, or rather impracticability, of safely dividing a tight stricture without the assistance obained from introducing a finger into the sac as a guide for the knife; secondly, the inefficiency of pressure to reduce the protruded parts, unless the orifice through which they have escaped be rendered very free indeed, so long as it operates through the medium of fluid contained in a bag; {Iiirdly, the fear of returning the sac along with the viscera, in which case strangulation may still be maintained by its narrow neck; fourtlily, the ground for believing that the neck of the sac is in general much concerned in causing the strangulating constriction, so as to require division no less than the fascial stricture itself; and, lastly, the chance of returning the intestine in a state im- proper for reduction, or of being foiled in doing so from adhesions or other morbid changes, requiring free inspection, and the use of the knife for their removal. Umhilical Hernia. Children are sometimes bom with a malformation of the abdominal parietes, which exposes the peritoneum of the epi- gastric region to view, and allows the viscera to protrude, not- withstanding any pressure that may be employed to prevent them from doing so. Such imperfectly formed beings generally die soon after birth ; and if they survive, must labour perma- nently under the inconvenience which attends the improtected condition and displacement of their bowels ; all that art can do being to afford some mechanical support, where the parietes of the abdomen are defective, by means of a firm case of leather or other suitable material. But, independently of this defective structure, the viscera may be protruded through the umbilical

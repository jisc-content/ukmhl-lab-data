188 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, is much more readily accomplished when the fracture is tlirough the trochanters, than when it is confined to the neck In the latter case, most surgeons in this country believe that osseous union is impossible, unless the reflected ligament, or fibrous covering of the neck, which is continuous with the capsule of the joint, remains entire. There is no doubt that the surfaces of the bones are very apt either to continue quite separate, or to be tmited by a flexible fibrous medium. But none of the argu- ments which have been adduced to prove the impossibility of osseous junction seem to be conclusive ; and though the small extent and mobility of the broken surfaces, the absence of vascular tissues surrounding the fracture, and perhaps also the presence of the synovial fluid, may render the cure very difficult, it ought stiU to be regarded as a possible occurrence. An attempt, therefore,, to unite the fracture ought always to be made, and if it fails, the patient will at least have no ground to reflect on the careless treatment of his attendant. Thie .long^lint affords the most effectual means of preserving the proper position, but has been objected to on the ground that the pressure on the instep of the foot which its use may occasion is very apt to cause mor- tification in the old people who are subject to the accident. As extension is not required, there should be little risk of this dis- agreeable effect; but if it were to appear, the limb ought to be immediately freed from all restraint, and simply laid over a large pillow or folded bolster, which will tend to prevent displacement of the fractured surfaces. A fibrous connection wOl then be gradually formed, with more or less shortening of the thigh ; and as strength retui'ns, the patient should, by cold affusion, and gentle exercise, endeavour to regain the use of the limb. In process of time he becomes able to walk with the assistance of a staff and high-heeled shoe. In fractru-e through the trochanters osseous reunion is certaioly and readily accomplished, provided the limb be kept steady in a proper position ; and, judging from my own experience, I should say, that the long spHnt may always be safely employed for this piu'pose, since it is reqiui'ed merely to prevent motion of the limb. \

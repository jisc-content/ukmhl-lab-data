It was further believed that mercmy, administered so as to produce its constitutional effect, or feverish excitement with salivation, acted as a certain antidote to this poison, whether operating locally or generally; but that unless it encountered the poison previously to being absorbed from the sores, it merely arrested the morbid derange- ment in progress, without preventing the occurrence of the other secondary symptoms, which required successive courses of sali- vation for their remedy. It is now fuUy ascertained that the poison of the present day, though producing local effects in all respects similar to those described as resulting from syphilis, does not give rise to the dreadful consequences which have just been mentioned, when treated without mercury. The cure may be tedious, and the skin, throat, or periosteum may be slightly affected, but none of the serious effects that used to be so much dreaded ever appear; and even the trivial ones just noticed comparatively seldom present themselves. "We must therefore conclude, either that the violence of the poison is worn out, or that the effects formerly attributed to it depended on the treat- ment. The latter of these opinions is supported by the fact, that secondary sjrmptoms of the utmost severity, embittering the patient's existence, and ultimately destroying it, are still met with in the practice of those who employ mercury profusely and indiscriminately; and it is a curious circumstance, which cannot be either explained or denied, that this medicine produces these effects, more especially those on the bones, only in persons who are suffering from venereal ulceration of the genital organs. The quantity of mercury requisite for thus injuriously affecting the system is very variableâ€”depending upon peculiarities of the patient's constitution, either natural or acquired. Of the former, a scrofulous disposition may be particularly mentioned; and of the latter, one of the most important is that occasioned by mercury itself, sitice a person who has taken it to such an extent as to have been disordered by its operation, is ever after very susceptible of its effect. It is generally noticed tliat those

In this case, the part is not only deprived of sensation and voluntary motion, but is com- pletely divested of all vital properties, so that no opposition being any longer presented to the exercise of chemical attraction, putre- factive decomposition at once commences. The appearance of a mortified part varies with its texture, just as happens in putre- faction. The soft juicy tissues suffer most alteration, and the hard fibrous ones least. The former are reduced at once to the state of a fetid pulp, or hard leathery consistence, while the latter retain their distinctive characters for a much longer time. Another circumstance that affects the appearance of a mortified .part, is the degree of action which has preceded its death, since the softness and fetor will of course be greater if much fluid has been accumulated previously. This has led to the old-fashioned division of mortification into moist and dry. These terms have also been employed, with less propriety, to express the diflference which depends upon the disease being of internal or external origin; in other words, spontaneous, or the result of injury. The symptoms of mortification may be divided into those which precede its accomplishment, those exhibited by the mortified part, and those of the system which attend the local changes. The symptoms that precede acute mortification are, generally speaking, those indicative of intense inflammation. The redness

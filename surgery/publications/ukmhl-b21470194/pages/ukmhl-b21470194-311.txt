THROAT. 289 CHAPTEE XV. THEOAT. Wounds of the Throat. When self-destruction is attempted by cutting the throat, the wound is generally inflicted transversely near the os hyoides, some- times above, but more frequently below it. There is usually an extensive division of the integuments, which are occasionally the only parts injured—and when the injury penetrates deeply, it almost always extends into the pharynx. Sometimes an opening is made into the larynx, and in a few rare cases the trachea is cut, either alone or together with the oesophagus. The great blood-vessels are very seldom injured, from the force of the incision being spent in dividing the tough substance of the pharynx and air-passage, from the part of the throat which is chosen for the purpose, and from the position in which it is held, while the knife is applied. When they are opened, it is usually by a sharp-pointed knife being thrust directly down upon them. In considering the treatment of cut-throat, it is necessary to distinguish between—1. those cases in which an opening is made above the rima glottidis; 2. those in which it is below the rima glottidis, but does not extend to the oesophagus ; and, 3. those in which the oesophagus is wounded. When the aperture, as usually happens, is above the orifice of the larynx, the dangers to be dreaded, in the first instance, are the entrance of blood into the trachea during respiration, owing to its accumulation in the pharynx, and the escape of food through the wound during deglutition. To obviate the former of these, the cut edges should not. be brought together until the bleeding u

In all cases the best practice is to make a free incision as soon as possible through the seat of the disease, which is almost invariably on the palmar aspect. When the fibrovis tissues slough, the dead parts ought to be carefully withdrawn so soon as they are loose, since their pre- sence acts powerfully in keeping up irritation. Leeches, warm fomentations and poultices, are often productive of great harm in the treatment of paronychia, by directing attention from the only effectual mode of affording reliefâ€”namely, incision. After the parts are freely divided, a poultice may be applied for a few days, but not longer, as its relaxing effect, if continued, proves injurious. "When the tendons or bones are destroyed, amputa- tion must be performed, a,s the finger, even though it might be healed, could not be of any service to the patient. Exfoliation of the distal phalanx, which frequently occurs, does not require the same proceeding, as the finger, though somewhat shortened by it, is not materially impaired either in appearance or utility. The Palmar Fascia, on the ulnar side of the hand, is liable to contraction, attended with thickening, which produces more or less complete and permanent flexion of the little and ring fingers. This affection occurs in middle-aged and elderly per- sons of the male sex. It seems to be induced by violent exer- tion and pressure of the hand. All Idnds of external apphcations have been found quite unavailing in its treatment, and the only effectual mode of affording relief is to rupture the contracted fibres by forcible extension of the contracted finger, either simply or after a preliminary subcutaneous incision through part of the band, when it is very strong.

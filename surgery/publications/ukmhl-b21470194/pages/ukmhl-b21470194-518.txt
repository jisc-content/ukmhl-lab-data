The conjunctival covering of the eye and eyelids is very liable to inflammation, in consequence of a great variety of irritations, both direct and indirect. Bright light, intense heat, cold wind, acrid fumes, dust, and foreign bodies of all lands introduced under the eyelids, produce inflammatory symptoms more or less severe, according to the irritability of the individual, and the degree of irritation.

Between these extremes there are innumerable shades of difference in the severity of the symp- toms, according to the peculiarities of particular cases. When the inflammation is very intense, the turgescence of the conjunc- tiva is sometimes so great, as to cause an obvious swelling of the membrane, which is named Chemosis. It depends on eff'u- sion into the loose subjacent cellular texture, partially conceals

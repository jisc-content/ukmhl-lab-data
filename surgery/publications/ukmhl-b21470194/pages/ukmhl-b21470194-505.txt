BRAIN. 483 not distinctly connected with the nerves, so far as can be traced by dissection, yet agrees so much in its symptoms with the tumours just described, that it certainly ought to be considered along with them. It is almost always about the size of a ]3ea, smooth, round, or oval, and of a firm yellowish structure. It is seldom, if ever, observed to increase, being as large when first discovered, as it is found to be at any time afterwards. It is seated immediately under the skin, which it slightly elevates; occurs on the inferior extremities much more frequently than on the superior ; and is more rare in males than females, who are usually affected with it before middle age. In one case, the subject of which was a middle-aged lady, I found a tumour of this kind lying under the naU of the little finger. It is the seat of uneasy sensations, which suffer occasional paroxysms of exacerbation, sometime^ periodically, but chiefly in consequence of excitement, either local or general. Emotions of the mind often produce this effect; and it is frequently observed, that the same circumstances which induce the attacks, when repeated, cause their sudden cessation. The only remedy for the disease is excision, which no less easily than quickly and safely relieves the patient from it.

JOINTS. 249 queiitly-repeated doses, is a most valuable remedy, not only by allaying violent action, but also by promoting the secretions of the skin and mucous membranes. When the inflammation is sub-acute, warm fomentations, anodyne liniments, such as the liniment of soap and opiiim, with the iirternal use of diaphoretic mediciues, as Dover's Powder, calomel and opium, or vinum colcldci, afford most relief. In its chronic state, counter-irritation effected by stimulating liniments, blisters, tartrate of antimony, setons, and issues, especially those made by the actual cautery, "with perfect rest, and a moderate degree of pressure, are the means wluch deserve most confidence.

Dropsy of the Joints. The synovial membranes of the joints, though all similar to each other, and resembhug in structure as well as function the serous coverings of the soft parts, are not equally subject to dropsical effusion. It is extremely common in that of the knee, but very rare in all the others. Dropsy of the knee-joint is occasioned by a great variety of circumstances. It occurs most frequently in persons of weak and irritable constitutions; who often suffer from it in consequence of very slight direct initation, such as twists and bruises, or the indirect operation of exposure to cold. It is met with, however, occasionally in the strongest frames ; but then the irritation is

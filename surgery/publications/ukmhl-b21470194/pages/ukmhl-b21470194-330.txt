PEINCITLES OF SURGERY. 308 If tlie wound of the parietes is small, or near the upper part of the chest, internal hemorrhage may take place to a great extent without any external indication of its existence, especially if, as sometimes, but very rarely, happens, it should proceed from one of the intercostal arteries. Various symptoms of blood accumulating in the chest have been observed and carefully described as affording the means of recognising it. Of these the most important are, coldness of the extremities—clammy per- spiration of the face—a purple colour of the cheek on the side affected—inability of lying on the sound side of the 'body, which is probably the cause of the precediag symptom—extreme oj)pression of breathing—a small fluttering pulse—suppression of urine—and a want of the usual resonance when the affected side of the chest is subjected to percussion. As all these signs, and also those more questionable ones which have not been thought deserving of mention, whether taken together or sepa- rately, must be regarded as insufficient to yield positive proof on the subject, it is prudent in doubtful cases to open the wound in order to ascertain the truth. In consequence of wounds and fractures of the thorax, air is frequently injected into the cellular substance under the integu- ments of the chest, constituting what is called Emphysema, and in other cases it is accumtdated within the jDleura so as to distend the membrane, and compress the sound lung with distressing or even fatal effect. It is highly important to be acqoiainted with the circumstances on which these events depend, and the mode of preventing or remedying them. For the production of emphysema, it is requisite that there should be an aperture in the pleura costalis, to admit the air into the cellular substance, and the power which forces it to enter is always the contraction of the parietes of the thorax ; but there are two sources from which the air thus impelled may be derived. One of these is a simple jDcnetrating wound of the thoracic parietes, so nari'ow, or so shaped and situated, as to allow the air to enter the chest during inspiration, but oppose its free exit during ex- piration, permitting it to pass no further than through the pleura.

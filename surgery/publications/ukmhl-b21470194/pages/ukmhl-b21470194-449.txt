The discharge of blood may take place either from the surface of the mucous membrane, or from a morbid structure into which it has degene- rated. In the latter case, remedial means can be of jio use, but in the former it is generally possible to moderate and even subdue the morbid flow, by correcting any derangement of the system that has indii-ectly occasioned it, by soothing the parts concerned if they indicate excitement, and by administering the tincture of muriate of iron, the uva wrsi, or other astringent medicines.

Confinement to bed in the hori- zontal posture, a mild diet, and palliation of the symptoms, constitute all the treatment requisite for recovery.

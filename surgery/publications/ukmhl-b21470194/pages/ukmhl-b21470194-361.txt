ABDOMEN. 339 prevent the occiirrence of hernia in persons whose predisposition to the disease is manifested by a fulness perceptible in the groin during the impulse of coughing, and by a painful sensation at the same part whenever the viscera are subjected to more than usual pressure, as in making exertion with the arms, or speaking loud. The predisposition being thus guarded against, all sources of excitement must be carefully avoided. The patient should abstain from every sort of food that, by producing flatulence, causes distension of the bowels; he ought to correct any tendency that may be observed to accumulation in the intestinal canal; and he should never engage in exercises or employments that require severe bodily exertion. In the treatment of congenital hernia, it is of great consequence that the truss should be applied as early as possible, in order that the natural disposition which the parts concerned have to close at the time of birth may be allowed to exert its effect, and a radical cure be thus obtained. Beyond this age, if a bandage is ever required, it can very rarely be afterwards dispensed with. Various attempts have at different times been made to remedy the tendency to protrusion by operative procedure, but of these it is needless to mention more than the one some years ago pro- posed by Professor Wiitzer, of Bonn. This was to invaginate the scrotal integument by pressing it up the inguinal canal, retain it-there by passing a needle through it, together with the margin of the external ring, and then keep all the parts concerned in this condition by a very complicated apparatus, until the adhesive process was so far advanced as to render it unnecessary. Approv- ing of the principle—but disliking the complexity of this method —I have endeavoured to simphfy it by employing merely apiece of bougie, gutta percha, or other solid substance, sufficient to fill the hollow of the invaginated integument, with a double thread attached to one of its extremities, and a curved needle in a fixed handle. In performing the operation by means of the needle guided along the finger, which is introduced fairly within the abdominal ring, first one of the threads and then the other is passed through the edge of the tendon, the bougie is drawn up

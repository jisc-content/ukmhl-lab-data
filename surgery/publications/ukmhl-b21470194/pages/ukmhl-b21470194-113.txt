BLOOD-VESSELS. 91 CHAPTEE VIII. BLOOD-VESSELS. AKTERIES. The two great arterial trunks, the aorta and pulmonary artery, agree generally in structure and function, but differ remarkably in two respects. The branches of the former unite or anastomose freely with their neighbours, while those of the latter continue unconnected from their origin to their termination ; and the coats of the aorta are prone to morbid action, while those of the pulmonary artery are hardly ever known to suffer from it. It is the aorta alone which affords subject for surgical practice. The arterial tube is comj)osed of three coatsâ€”1. The ex- ternal or cellular; 2. The middle or fibrous; and, 3. The in- ternal or serous. The first of these consists merely of condensed cellular texture, and is therefore not recognised by some as a distinct tissue, being regarded rather as a modification of the cellular sheath which envelopes other organs of the body. But the larger arteries and veins, where lying contiguous, have usually a covering of this kind in addition to the one in question, which, from its compactness, strength, and constant existence, ought certainly to be considered an essential constituent part of the vessel The middle coat is composed of circular fibres, which, from their appearance and properties, have been referred to the elastic tissue; but also possess a contractile property. When examined in a large artery of the human body, or in the artery of a large animal, as the horse, they are distinctly extensible and resilient, so as to. resemble the ligamcnium michae of quadrapeds, and other similar stnictures. The elastic property of tliis coat must tend to preserve the vessel of a certain size, in opposition

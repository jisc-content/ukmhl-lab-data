45 GRANULATION. CHAPTEE V. GKANULATION. Effects of the Granulating Action^ The term Granulation is applied to an action, which repairs breaches in the continuity of the surface that are not healed by primary union. Such breaches may be caused either by violence or absorption, and m both cases are named Ulcers. An ulcer may be defined to be a solution of continuity in a natural sur- face, secreting matter. , \ When a wound does not heal by the first intention, it begins about twenty-four hours after the injury has been sustained to be painful, and attended with the other symptoms of inflamma- tion. A thin serous discharge oozes out from it, and by and by the surface acquires a uniform appearance, whatever be the tissues which compose it, owing to an effusion of IjTuph that seals up the interstices of the cellular substance, and forms a thin superficial covering. About the third day, sooner or later, according to the activity of action, the incrustation of lymph becomes organized, — it acquires a red colour, bleeds when touched, and before many days have elapsed, shoots up into small granvdar projections, whence the process is named. These granulations are small, pointed, firm, and vascular,—they are covered with a fine pellicle, and secrete a peculiar straw-coloured fluid named Pus, the properties of which will be more particu- larly described hereafter. The wound is now, properly speaking, an ulcer, and the sub- sequent process of healing is the same as in ulcers caused by absoi-ption. The inequality of surface, if any existed, gradually disappears, the bottom of the ulcer becomes regularly concave,

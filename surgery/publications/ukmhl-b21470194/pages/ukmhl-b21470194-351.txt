329 ABDOMEN, a thiu stratum over the whole peritoneal surface, or accumulated at one part. â–  In the diagnosis of wounded intestine, probing of every sort is quite inadmissible. The shape and size of the weapon that inflicted the injury, together with the direction and extent of the course which it seems likely to have taken, will afford some groimd of probable suspicion ; vomiting, or dejection of blood by stool, will not only prove that the gut has been wounded, but lead to a conjecture as to the seat of injury ; and the symptoms of intestinal effusion, or the escape of feculent and bilious matters from the wound, will render the case more decided. Should the wounded intestine protrude through the integuments, the extent of the injury may, of course, be determined by simple inspection. In respect to the treatment of wounded intestine, it is evident, that unless the inju.red part presents itself to view, no local treatment can be employed to remedy the injury, and that the patient's oaly chance of recovery will depend upon the powers of the system effecting the process of reparation which has been described. The object of the surgeon should be to prevent this process from being disturbed, with which view he will be led to enjoin absolute rest, with strict starvation, and abstinence from purgatives. If the injured part of the gut is protruded, an im- portant question will present itself in regard to the management of the wound, with respect to which much variety of opinion and practice has existed. If the wound is very small, and especially if it is seated in a part of the canal not usually distended by its contents, the most prudent course wiU probably be to return the gut, as if it were sound, without any more ceremony. Should the wound be some- what more than a mere puncture, and aUow its cut edges to be distinguished, a suture ought to be passed through them by means of ?i needle, and tied, after which both ends may be cut away close to the knot, and the gut returned, since it has been ascertained by experiments on the lower animals, that stitches inserted into tlie coats of the intestinal canal are detached by \dcerative absorption towards the interior of the tube, and thus

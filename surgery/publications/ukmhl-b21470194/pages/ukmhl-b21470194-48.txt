PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 26 the action of the caustic is completed, a poultice ought to be applied uiitU the portion of skin tbat has been destroyed sepa- rates, when some foreign substances, such as those already mentioned, must be introduced to prevent the opening from closing. The actual cautery is the best method of the whole, since the breach which it occasions requires no means for keeping it open, and does not heal until after many weeks or months, or healing applications are employed. The pain is severe but almost momentary, and, on the wliole, much less than that of the caustic; while the counter-irritatiag effect is found to be greater than that of any of the other means.

This practice is of ancient origin, and held in much esteem in Eastern countries, where, as iir China and Japan, its employment is said to constitute a distinct department of the surgical profes- sion. Some years ago it was tried pretty extensively in France

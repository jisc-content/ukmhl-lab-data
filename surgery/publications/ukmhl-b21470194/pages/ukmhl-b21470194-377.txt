ABDOMEN. 355 mortem examinations of femoral hernias, the obturator artery has been found rising from the epigastric or external iliac and encircling the neck of the sack. This origin of the artery is now ascertained to be far from unusual, but there is reason to doubt that the vessel will often allow the hernia to protrude between it and the trunk from which it rises, so as to lie on the pubal side of the sac, and be in the way of the knife; and even though it were to be so situated, there seems little danger of cutting its coats in dividing the stricture, provided this part of the operation be properly performed. The tumour, which is generally very small, depends principally on fluid accumulated in the sac, and the portion of intestine subjected to strangulation is often no larger than the point of the finger ; but even though it should equal in size a pigeon's egg, which it seldom exceeds, a very slight dilatation of the stricture is sufficient for permitting reduction. Instead of the coarse and dangerous procedure of Gimbernat, therefore, the division of the tight edge of the fasciae should be effected very gently and cautiously. The surgeon having intro- duced his fore-finger into the sac close up to its neck, with the nail turned towards the intestine, feels for the crescentic margin of the fasciae, or rather for its situation, since in cases requiring an operation the stricture is too tight to permit the smallest part of the finger to be passed through. He then carries up a blunt- pointed slightly-curved bistoury along his finger, towards which the flat side is turned, and carefully insinuates its point within the stricture, which being accomplished, he turns the knife so as to direct the cutting edge to it; and if sufficient dilatation is not thus obtained, he presses the edge of the knife on the tense fibres without using any sawing motion. As room is gained, he presses his finger gradually forwards, until he feels that the point is fairly within the abdominal cavity, wlien he may be sure that enough has been done. It often happens that, immediately upon the return of the protruded viscera, a quantity of serous fluid escapes from the abdomen, which has an alarming appearance, but is not of the slightest consequence. The after-treatment of tlie patient should be conducted on the same principles which have

PRINCIPLES OP SURGERY. 206 bones are originally formed. He carefuUy investigated the pro- cess of ossification during incubation, and detailed the steps of its progress in the chick as well as other young animals. The rudiment of the future bone being traced from its earliest dis- tinguishable appearance, was found first to present the characters of a jelly; then to acquire the consistence of cartilage or gristle; and finally to reach the perfect osseous state: whence it was contended, that a structure which thus originated in a distinct form, and independently of any other, could not owe its increase afterwards to a different source. HaUer also engaged his pupils Detlef and Boehmer in extensive series of experiments, by break- ing the bones of animals, and feeding them with madder during their recovery ; fi-om the results of which he inferred, that Du- hamel had been mistaken in supposing that fractures are re- united by ossification of the periosteum, " Notwithstanding these objections, and the authority of the physiologist from whom they proceeded, the doctrine of Duhamel stUl maintained its ground; and not long afterwards—^viz., in the year 1780—derived a great accession of strength from the experiments of Troja, who, by destroying the marrow of bones, caused their death, and the formation of new shells surrounding them, apparently from ossification of the periosteum. Tliis ex-r periment, which Troja himself performed some hundreds of times, when repeated and varied by the pathologists of almost every country, seemed to confirm the ossific power attributed to the periosteum beyond question, until Scarpa, the distinguished Professor of Pavia, again investigated the grounds on which it was originally founded by Duhamel, In Scai^pa's treatise,' De Penitiori Ossium Structura,' which was published in 1799, he explained that the foliated appearance, presented by bones that had been burnt, did not depend upon the development of a structure naturally belonging to them, but was an effect pro- duced by the unequal action of the fire ; and that the separation of scales from diseased bones was no stronger proof of their pos- sessing a laminated structure, since thin and broad portions of dead substance are wont to be detached from the skin and other

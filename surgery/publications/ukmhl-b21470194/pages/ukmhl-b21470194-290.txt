PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 268 been retained together by silver sutures, a roller is to be applied in tlie figure of 8 for giving the requisite support, wliich it does much better than any soi-t of splint. In determining the extent to which it is necessary to remove the bone, the truly carious part must be carefully distinguished from the rough and thickened state of the neighboiu'ing bone, which depends upon the effusion of new osseous substance in consequence of the disease causing irritation. When we read of the humerus being cut out to the extent of four inches, it may be safely concluded that this discrimination has not been duly regarded. The cases admitting this operation are much more frequent than those proper for excision of the shoulder-joint. Having adopted the practice when it was almost entirely neglected in this country, and employed it very extensively as well as suc- cessfully, I feel great pleasure in contemplating the benefit that has been derived from its introduction into general use. I have also employed it with great advantage in cases of anchylosis both from disease and injury. Tn such cases, after the flaps are reflected so as to expose the bones, their union should be divided by the saw, after which each of the ends may be readily removed to the extent requisite.

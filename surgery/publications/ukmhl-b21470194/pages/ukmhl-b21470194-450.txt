By Gonorrhoea is understood an inflammatory affection of the urethra, attended with a discharge of thick yellow fliiid. As the inflammatory symptoms subside, the discharge becomes thinner, paler, and at last almost watery, when it constitutes what is called a Gleet. Tliis disease is usually the result of impure intercourse; but whether it requires for its production that the person infecting should have been infected—in other words, whether it is to be ascribed to the influence of a peculiar poison transmitted from one person to another—is not yet fully ascer- tained. There is great variety m the susceptibility of different individuals, and the matter seems active in proportion to its thiclmess and yellowness. The watery discharge of a gleet, in persons of ordinary sensibility to irritation, is innocuous, but in others it may occasion the most violent gonorrhoea. The first symptoms of the disease generally appear from one to four days after the poison has been applied. They consist in itching, redness, and swelling of the orifice of the urethra, and are soon succeeded by a painful burning sensation in the same part, particularly severe during micturition, the calls to which are much more frequent than usual A thin serous exudation then takes place, at first merely gluing together the edges of the orifice, but quickly becoming more copious, and at the same time acqiuring a purulent appearance. While these local changes are occurring, the system suffers general derangement in proportion to its irritability, and the acuteness of the inflammation. This symptomatic fever is often attended with local disturbance of

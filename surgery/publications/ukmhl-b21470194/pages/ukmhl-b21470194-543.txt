MOUTH. 521 CHAPTEE XXIII. MOUTH. Salivary Glands. The ducts of both the parotid and submaxillary glands are liable to become the seat of calcareous concretions, which are named Salivary Calculi. Their composition is phosphate of lime, agglu- tinated by a small quantity of animal matter. They have usually a yellowish-white colour, oval figure, and finely-tuberculated sur- face. They vary in size from that of a millet-seed to that of an almond with the shell. In the parotid duct they are very rarely met with, but in that of the submaxillary not unfrequently. They occasion pain, swelling, and hardness, and sometimes give rise to the formation of an abscess. In the parotid duct, the symptoms thus produced are apt to be confounded with those of rheumatism, toothache, gum-boil, or suppuration of the maxillary antrum ; while under the tongue they may be occasionally mis- taken for those of encysted tumours. In aU cases of doubt, it is right to search the duct with a probe, and to feel for the calculus, by pressing on the place where it is suspected to be. So soon as a free incision is made, the concretion escapes, together with the fluid accumulated about it. The usual situation of these con- cretions is immediately within the orifice of-the ducts ; but they have also been found imbedded in the substance of the sub- maxillary gland, where they excited an increased and unhealthy secretion, with general swelling and hardness of the gland. In such cases the calculus, if distinctly recognised, may be extracted by cutting down upon it, from the mouth, which I have had occasion to do. When the Parotid duct is included in a wound of the cheek,

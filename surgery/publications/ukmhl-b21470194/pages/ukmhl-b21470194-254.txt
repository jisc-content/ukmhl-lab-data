232 l-mNCIPLKS OF SUEGEIIY. CHAPTEE XII. JOINTS. Sprains and Bmises. The ligamentous tissue is not productive of pain excited by the ordinary stimuli whicli occasion it in other parts ; but though insensible to cutting and tearing, it suffers severely from being overstretched, in conformity with the general law, that the sen- sibility of parts bears some relation to their use in the animal economy. The articular cartilages and hniag synovial mem- brane again suffer from violent compression. The symptoms and effects, primaiy as well as secondary, which proceed from these two sources, are very similar. Joints of the ginglymoid or hinge-like structure, and those of the arthi'odia Idud, such as the tarsal and carpal articulations, are exposed to the first-men- tioned injury, while the ball-and-socket joints, though nearly exempt from it, are subject to bruises from their respective sur- faces being squeezed together. Both strains, or sprains as they are called, and bruises are attended in the first instance with severe sickening pain, and more or less complete inability of using the joint. To these symptoms succeed .swelling, tension, and, if the joint is super- ficial, discoloration from ecchymosis, and not unfrequently in- flammation, particularly if the patient possesses a scrofulous or otherwise irritable constitution. The inflammation, when chronic, leads to thickening and adhesions of the articular apparatus, which occasiofi deformity and lameness, or morbid degenerations of the same part, which frequently end in the destruction of the joint; when acute, it tends to sxijipuration. The immediate effects of these injuries are always distressing, and their secondary

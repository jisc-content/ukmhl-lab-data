riUNCIPLES OF SURGERY. GO CHAPTER VL SUPPURATION. SuppuRiVTiON consists in the formation of a peculiar fluid named I'us, which possesses the following characters :â€”It has nearly the consistence of cream ; it has a pale yellow or straw colour ; \^ it occasions no smell while cold, but when heated to the tempe- rature of the body emits a faint odour ; it is opaque, and when examined by the microscope, appears to be composed of globules suspended in a transparent fl.uid; it sinks in water ; it is coagu- ^ latcd by muriate of ammonia; and sometimes has its fluidity diminished, merely by removal from the body. It was formerly believed that pus originated from putrefac- tion or degeneration of the blood and other fl.uid or solid parts ; and a loss of substance or breach in the continuity of the solids was thought essential to its formation. It is now ascertained A that pus is produced by a peculiar secreting action of the capil- lary vessels, wliich may occur without any solution of continuity. The mucous membranes, after being inflamed, frequently take on the suppurative action ; and the purulent secretion of granula- tions may be quoted as another instance, since the pus is dis- charged here at once from the vessels. A gi'anulating surface in several respects bears much resemblance to a mucous membrane, and may be regarded as a temporary covering instead of skin. Pus varies very much in consistence, colour, and other properties, from admixture of blood, the nature of the part, or the consti- tution of the patient. Suppuration may be divided into superficial and interstitial.

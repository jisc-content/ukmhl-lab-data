PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 318 and, in addition to a number of ligatures, it is sometimes neces- sary to stuff tlie cavity witli lint.- Cystic Sarcoma. It is comparatively rare to meet with tumours in the mamma entirely composed of a cystic structure ; but cysts are frequently found in growths of a solid kind, particularly the one last men- tioned, and are sometimes so large and numerous as to constitute the principal feature of the disease. Su'ch cystic formations occur at all periods of Hfe, generally in women of a healthy appear- ance ; occasion little inconvenience, except from their size; and tend to increase without any liniitation. Their nature may sometimes be recognised previous to removal by the imperfect feeling of fluctuation and bluish appearance of their contents, perceived through the thin distended integuments by which they are covered; but, in general, the nature of the structure is not precisely ascertained until it is displayed by a section. The inconvenience which results from the bulk of the tumour, and the risk of its becoming the seat of malignant action, are sufficient grounds for recommending excision of the disease at all stages of its progress; and the operation may be performed with the same favourable prognosis as for the fibrous and simple sarcoma. Simple serous cysts, existing without any complication of morbid texture, may be easily remedied by evacuating their contents through means of a trocar, and immediately after- wards applying a blister. Carcinomatous Sarcoma. There is no other part of the body in which carcinomatous degeneration occurs so frequently as in the mamma, though a large proportion of the cases in which it has been, and still is, too often supposed to exist, if subjected to a more accurate diagnosis, would be referred to other kinds of disease, and par- ticularly to those that have been already considered. Carcinoma occiirs in the breast at all periods of life, from the age of twenty upwards; but commences rarely before thirty-live, and most

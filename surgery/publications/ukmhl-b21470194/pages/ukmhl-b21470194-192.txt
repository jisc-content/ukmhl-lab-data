170 PllINCIPLES OF SURGERY. very loug anterior flap, has relieved the operation from its great defect. In operating at the lower third of the thigh, when a suffi- ciently long anterior flap cannot be obtained for the purpose, I think the circular method should be preferred, and have loug employed it with the most satisfactory results, by making two semilunar incisions from side to side, close above the patella, reflecting the skin, dividing the muscles as high as they are exposed in front, and a little lower behind, to -allow for the dif- ference in their retraction ; and lastly, drawing them upwards, so as to let the saw be applied two inches higher than the mus- cular incision in front. The tliigh may be amputated at the hip-joint; but in this case the shock inflicted on the system is so great, and the wound which remains to be healed is so extensive, that the operation ought never to be performed unless the patient's situation affords him no other chance of escape from certain death. There are various modes of operating, the choice of which must be regulated by the circumstances of the case, but in general the following one will be found the most eligible, in respect both to the ease of its performance and to its result:â€” An assistant should grasp the limb as liigh as possible, press- ing with liis thumbs upon the artery in the groin, where it lies on the brim of the pelvis, and with his fingers upon the hip. The surgeon introduces the point of a narrow knife about ten inches long, nearly half way between the spinous process of the ileum and trochanter major, thrusts it through transversely before the bone, so as to form an anterior flap, which, being held up by an assistant, he makes another from the posterior parts, then desires the limb to be abducted, opens the joint^, and completes the disarticulation. The fore-arm ought to be amputated by making two equal flaps, from before and behind; the arm being held while tliis is done injhejniddle state of supination and pronation, in order to relax the muscles equally, and thus facilitate the operation. The hand may be removed at the wrist-joint by transfixing the limb

a. Bilateral. h. Unilateral. AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS Dislocation of Lower Jaw. 119. Dislocation may involve only one or both of the condyles, i.e. it may be unilateral or bilateral. If bilateral the moutb is widely open, and cannot be closed, tbe chin projects, there is a hollow in front of the ear on either side where the condyle should be, and an undue prominence above the zygoma in the temporal fossa, caused by the displaced coronoid process. Speech is impaired, deglutition is interfered with, and the saliva dribbles from the mouth. If unilateral there is a marked depression in front of the ear on the affected side, and the chin is displaced in the opposite direction. The other symptoms are present, though in a less degree. 120. Fractures of the Lower Jaw are generally com- -^^^^'J^* pound, sometimes from external wound, but more fre- — quently from laceration of the tissues of the gum by the broken fragments. Any part of the bone may be broken, e.g. the neck, angle, ramus, or coronoid process, but the most frequent situation is through the body, at that spot where it is specially weakened by the mental foramen and the deep socket for the canine tooth. Fracture through the Body.—The symptoms of frac- a. Body, ture are usually well marked, especially when, as is often the case, the fracture is double {i. e. on both sides of the symphysis), for the central portion is then drawn down by the muscles attached to the hyoid bone. There is considerable mobility of the fragments with crepitus, irregularity in the line of the teeth, dribbling of saliva from the mouth, impairment of speech, and if, as is often the case, the fracture is compound, laceration of the gums. Fracture through the Angle or Lower part of the Ramus. *• ^JJ^]^ ^Vixui —In this case the displacement is not usually great, owing to the muscles on either side (masseter and

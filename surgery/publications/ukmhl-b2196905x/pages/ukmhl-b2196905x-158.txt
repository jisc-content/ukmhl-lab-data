Bnchondromata are of much rarer occurrence, but would present somewhat similar symptoms. 238. Fibrous Tumours are sometimes met with springing from the periosteum of the bones of the orbit. They may be distinguished by their slow growth, firm consistence, and intimate connection with the subjacent bone, with which they are usually con- nected by a broadish base. 239. Deposits of Gummatous matter may occur in the cellular tissue of the orbit, independently of or in con- nection with syphilitic periostitis (231), producing almost identical symptoms. 240. Hydatid Cysts are sometimes met with in the interior of the orbit as soft, well-defined, fluctuating tumours, causing in many cases protrusion of the eye- ball. On exploratory puncture, the clear, thin, watery character of the fluid, which often contains the heads or booklets of the echinococci, will reveal the nature of the swelling. 241. Under the term "Aneurism of the Orhit," " Pul- sating Ikomour of Orhit," " Vascular protrusion of Eyeball" are included several very different conditions, which are characterised, however, by somewhat similar symptoms, viz. in addition to those already described as peculiar to tumours of the orbit (235), there is pulsation of the eyeball, sometimes perceptible to the eye, but almost always to be detected by the finger. In some cases there is a distinct or circumscribed, pulsating swelling, affecting, only a limited portion of the orbit, while in other cases the pulsation is general, afi'ecting all parts of it. On auscultation over the eyebrow or orbit, a distinct

REGIONAL SUEGEET 198 Enchondromata. Surcomata. Tophi or Chalk- stones. Hypertrophy. the superficial structures, may gradually extend inwards, involving the external auditory canal and deeper parts of the ear. 336. JEncTiondromata, or tumours consisting of car- tilage only, and sarcomata may in rare cases attack the external ear. 337. Tophi, or ChalJc-stones, are the terms applied to the collections of urate of soda often found on the edge of the hehx or in other parts of the auricle, in patients suffering from chronic gout. The little concretions, which vary in size, are at first somewhat softish and of a doughy consistence; after a time they become solid and hard, forming small, irre- gular, whitish masses, which are plainly perceptible beneath the slrin, and finally the skin may ulcerate over them, and there may be a discharge of the chalky matter, a slight cicatrix alone remaining to mark the seat of the former deposit. At other times active in- flammation is excited in the neighbourhood of the deposit, and a small abscess forms, which, when it bursts, discharges pus mixed with particles of urate of soda. 338. Hypertrophy of the Auricle, or Lohule, is some- times produced as the result of chronic inflammatory changes affecting these parts.

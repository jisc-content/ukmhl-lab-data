ArrECTIONS OF THE TONGTTE 95 may subside or terminate in tlie formation of an abscess, or diffuse suppuration. 145. Abscess usually appears as a circumscribed swell- Abscess, ing, more or less superficial, or deeply seated in the substance of the tongue, fluctuating, or of an elastic consistence; on inquiry it will generally be found to have been preceded by symptoms of inflammation. It may also occur in connection with syphilis, as the result of the softening and breaking down of a gummatous deposit (141). 146. Macroglossia or hypertrophy of the Tongue is Macrogiossi usually a congenital affection; the enlargement, which may be symmetrical or may affect one side more than the other, is often so great that the organ projects from the mouth, Prolapsus linguce. This condition has been referred to hypertrophy of the muscular elements, or of the fibrons tissue of the tongue, but in many cases it appears to be the result of lymphatic obstruction and consequent dilatation of the lymph-spaces which nor- mally exist in its substance, and should therefore be regarded as an example of diffused lymphangioma or lymph-tumour affecting the tongue ; in some cases it is associated with the presence of a hygroma (252), or cystic tumour, at one side of the neck, which is then probably due to the same cause, viz. lymphatic obstruction.* In those instances where the affection is not congenital, it usually comes on during the first two or three years after birth. 147. Owing to congenital shortening of the frsemim Tongue-tie. linguae, the anterior portion of the tongue may be fixed and bound down to the floor of the mouth, so that it is incapable of being protruded beyond the teeth; * Maguire, 'Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' vol. xiv, p. 416-

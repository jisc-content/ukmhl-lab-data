TUMOTJES OF SCALP AND VAULT OP CEANIUM 11 Jcqmred Tumours. coming gradually involved, the subjacent tone may subsequently become implicated in the disease. The characteristic appearance of the ulcer, the history of the case, and in many cases the age of the patient (usually over 40), will usually serve to distinguish epi- thelioma from a fungating sebaceous cyst (6), with which affection it is liable to be confounded. 16. The scalp may become the seat of " horns" or Honis. warty growths. These structures usually result trom the drying up of the contents of a sebaceous cyst, which has either ruptured spontaneously or been burst acci- dentally ; in other cases they resemble more the struc- ture of a simple wart or papilloma. 17. Enlargement of the Lymphatic Glands at the back Enlarged Glands, of the head along the attachment of the occipito-frontalis (occipital), or behind the ear at the upper end of the sterno-mastoid (posterior auricular), is often seen and may be due to numerous causes (246, 247, 248). The inflammation, to which the enlargement is most commonly due, and which may be either of an acute or a chronic nature, may gradually subside, or it may go on to suppuration and the formation of an abscess (14). 18. Lipomata or Fatty Tumours are sometimes met Lipoma, with on the scalp, most commonly in the occipital re- gion and at the back of the neck (268.) 19. Fibromata, Molluscum Fibrosum, or small tumours Fibroma, consisting of a simple outgrowth of the connective tissue elements of the skin, are sometimes met with at the posterior part of the scalp and back of the neck. The little tumours, which are often multiple, are at first sessile, but as they slowly increase in size they be- come pedunculated and pyriform in shape; they are usually of softish consistence, and are covered by normal skin. They generally occur in adults, giving rise to no

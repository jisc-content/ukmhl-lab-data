163 AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK. seen as the result of wounds involving the food-pas- sages (282). 4. Branchial fisMcs, viz, narrow canals or channels, present at birth, opening externally by minute orifices, and running backwards towards the pharynx or oeso- phagus, with which they rarely communicate, are some- times seen. The external openings of the fistula, of which there may be more than one, sometimes two or three, are generally situated along the anterior border â€¢ of the sterno-mastoid muscle, more commonly just above the sterno-clavicular articulation.* These fistulous channels, which often secrete a clear, mucoid fluid, appear to be due to incomplete closure of the branchial clefts or fissures which are present during early foetal life ; they are often found associated with some other deformity, e.g. malformations of the external ear (328), macrostoma (94), &c. 277. Emphysema of the neck, due to the presence of Emphysema, air in the subcutaneous connective tissue, gives rise to a puffy swelling, soft and compressible, communicating to the finger pressed upon it a peculiar cracking sensa- tion. This condition may be due to several causes, viz.: 1. Extension of the same condition from the face (68), or chest, where there has been fracture of the ribs with injury to the lung. 2. Wounds of the neck involving the air-passages, when the external wound is small, or does not corre- spond in position with that in the larynx or trachea (278). 8. Injuries to the neck involving the air-passages, but without any external wound, e. g. fracture of the * Paget,' Medico-Chirurg. Trans.,' vol. Ixi.

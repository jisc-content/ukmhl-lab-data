They may remain stationary in this condition for a considerable length of time, giving rise to slight incon- venience, and may subsequently become absorbed and disappear under treatment, producing a fissured con- dition of the tongue (143), or they may soften and break down, giving rise to the formation of the deep tertiary ulcer (135). 142. In constitutional syphilis the tongue may be- come the seat of ulceration, either of a superficial or a deep character (135, 3). 143. As the result of absorption of gummatous de- posits, or after healing has taken place in the case of deep tertiary ulcers, fissures are left extending into the substance of the tongue, and at the same time, in con- sequence of cicatricial contraction of the adjacent tissues, considerable distortion is often produced, the tongue being twisted on itself or drawn over to either side. These fissures cannot be effaced by stretch- ing out the tongue with the fingers, thus differing from the rugse or simple folds in the mucous mem- brane, which are often present on the dorsum of the tongue of those who are the subjects of chronic dys- pepsia. 144. Acute inflammation of the substance of the tongue is sometimes seen as the result of injury, sali- vation by mercury, iodism, or in some cases occurring idiopathically without any apparent cause. The tongue rapidly swells so as to fill the mouth, and in consequence, speech, deglutition, and respiration are considerably interfered with ; the glands beneath the jaw are enlarged and painful, and there is excessive dis- charge of saliva from the mouth. The inflammation

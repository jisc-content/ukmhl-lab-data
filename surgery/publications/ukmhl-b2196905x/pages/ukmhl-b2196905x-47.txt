Froclnres of INJURIES OF THE HEAD 27 Skull. Simple fissures and fractures without displacement of the fragments may he unattended hj any symptoms, but when the fracture is complicated with displacement, symptoms of compression of the brain are generally present, and when there is an external wound, the fissure or depressed portion of bone can generally be seen or felt with the finger. Simple extravasation of blood, bounded by a raised and thickened margin, with an apparent depression in its centre, is very liable to be confounded with a fracture with displacement inwards of the fragments; for the diagnosis between these two affec- tions, cf. 21. Fracture of the Base may occur without any external 'BMe. ""^* ° wound, but is, in the majority of cases, a simple exten- sion downwards of a fracture of the vault, which may be either simple or compound. 1. Anterior Fossa.—In fractures of the anterior fossa, when the orbital plate of the frontal bone is involved, there is extravasation of blood into the cellular tissue of the eyelids and orbit. This extravasation is dis- tinguished from that attending an ordinary " black eye " (46) by its being more in the ocular and less in the palpebral conjunctiva, and also by its being most marked as it passes backwards towards the posterior part of the orbit. Persistent epistaxis is often present, the blood escaping through a fissure in the roof of the nasal fossa, and indicating a fracture through the ethmoid or body of the sphenoid bone. Hsematemesis is often jDresent, owing to blood which has been swallowed being rejected by the stomach. Paralysis of the nerves of the orbit may also be pro- duced. 1. Anterior Fossa.

Examination with the laryngoscope is scarcely prac- ticable in these cases, but if it can be employed, the false membrane lining the interior of the larynx might possibly be seen. The dyspnoea, which is so prominent a symptom, is due not only to the presence of the false membrane, which mechanically obstructs the entrance of air into the air-passages, but also to spasm (or, as some assert, to paralysis) of the muscles of the interior of the larynx, excited by the inflammation.

Tumours of Vj)per Jaw. Encliondroina. 70 REGIONAL SUEGEET Oateoma. 2. Malignant. Sarcoma. Carcinoma. 107. Encho7idromata, or tumours, consisting of a mixture of fibrous tissue and cartilage, are sometimes met witli, and may attain a large size; their rate of growth, is very variable, in some cases rapid, in others very slow. When running a rapid course, reach- ing a large size, these tumours are essentially of a malignant nature. 108. Exostoses are also met with, usually of the ivory variety ; they are sometimes found lying loose in the cavity of the antrum, owing to their having undergone fracture or spontaneous separation at their base of attachment. In rare instances ,the upper jaw becomes the seat of the diffused osteoma, a large, irregular, lobulated mass of osseous tissue, springing from the superior maxilla, and often involving the neighbouring cavities and other bones of the face ; great deformity is pro- duced by this condition, which in some cases appears to be a general hypertrophy of the bones of the face, those of the cranium being at times also similarly affected (cf. Leontiasis, 33 c). 109. The malignant forms of tumour met with in the upper jaw are usually either sarcomata or carcino- mata, the former being most common, and often con- taining cysts in their interior. Carcinomatous tumours are usually of the encephaloid variety, and though generally described as " cancer of the upper jaw," the bone itself is only secondarily in- volved, the original seat of the disease being, as a rule, the mucous membrane lining the nasal fossa or antrum, whence it extends, usually expanding the antrum and manifesting itself as an enlargement of the superior maxilla. The "diffused osteoma" above described is essen-

Perforation and Destruc- tion. masses, sometimes "like a bunch of earthworms," hang- ing down from the roof of the pharynx, and more or less completely blocking up the posterior nares. 89. Deviation of the Septum to either side may occur as a congenital malformation or as a result of injury, causing more or less constriction of the corresponding nostril and consequent obstruction to respiration; on examination of the nostril the nature of the deformity, which in extreme cases might lead one to suspect the presence of a polypus, will at once be apparent. 90. Blood Tumours of the Septum generally occur as the result of injury, and are often accompa,nied by frac- ture of the septum. They may be confined to one or appear on both sides of the septum, and, if of con- siderable size, may offer considerable obstruction to breathing. 91. Ahscess of the Septum, acute or chronic, may re- sult from injury or form spontaneously ; it usually appears as a painful, more or less prominent, fluctuating swelling, causing obstruction to respiration, and being in many cases followed by perforation of the septum. The situation of the swelling and other symptoms will readily distinguish it from polypus, with which it may be confounded. 92. Perforation of the S'ep^Mm is not uncommon as the result of syphilitic ulceration of the mucous membrane covering it, or of abscess of the septum; more rarely it is found in strumous subjects, and in these cases it is sometimes due to lupus attacking the interior of the nose. Workmen exposed to the vapour of bichromate of potash are liable to a peculiar form of perforation of the septum, which in some cases leads to its complete destruction (' Bichromate Disease '*).

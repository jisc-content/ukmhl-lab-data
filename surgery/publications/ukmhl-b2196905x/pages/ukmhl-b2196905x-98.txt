Gongenital.—Imperfect development, or absence more or less complete, of the lower jaw is sometimes seen. In many cases it is associated with some other congenital deformity, e.g. with the presence of branchial fistulae (276), malformations of the ear, supernumerary auricular appendages (328), macrostoma (94), &c. 2. From Dis- 2, From Disease. — Tumours of the upper jaw, growths within the mouth, hypertrophy of the tongue, cicatricial contraction after extensive injuries or ulcera- tion about the lower part of the face, &c., may all from simple mechanical causes (e.g. pressure, di-agging, &c.) produce considerable alteration in the shape of the lower jaw. 3. lu Rickets. 3.

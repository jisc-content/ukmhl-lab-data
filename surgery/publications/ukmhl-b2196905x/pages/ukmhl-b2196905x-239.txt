DIAGNOSIS OF CAUSE AND SEAT OF DEAFNESS 219 " Suppose the meatus to be closed with cerumen, or the tympanum to be obstructed with morbid products, the result of catarrh, the same effect will follow; and in the case of a patient with the auditory nerve un- affected, he will hear the tuning-fork more loudly on the side which is deaf from these causes, as either interfere with the outward passage of sound. "A person in whom the functions of one or both auditory nerves are impaired will hear the tuning-fork (on the vertex) less loudly than he should do in the one or in both ears, and in severe cases will not hear it at all. " It follows that, if one ear only be deaf, the tuning- fork will be heard better on this side if the disease is in the middle ear, and worse if it be in the labyrinth." In cases where deafness is simply due to Eustachian obstruction (viz. catarrhal thickening of the mucous membrane about its orifice or lining its interior, closure by a plug of inspissated mucus, &c.), and where the affection has not been so long neglected that serious changes have taken place in the tympanum, the loss of hearing will often readily disappear (though in many cases only temporarily) on inflating the middle ear by Diagnosis o f Cause and Seat of Deafness. 6. Inflation of Tynipanum. they are transmitted through the condacting apparatus than through the cranial bones. " Again, if the tuning-fork be placed on the vertex, and the external auditory meatus on one side be closed, the sound will be heard more intensely on this side than on the other. " This is also true in respect of the voice of the person on whom the experiment is being made, and in both cases is due to the fact that when the meatus is closed, the waves of sound in their passage out from the tympanum through the meatus are reflected again and agiiin, and therefore their effect on the auditory nerves becomes intensified " (Dalby, * Diseases of the Ear').

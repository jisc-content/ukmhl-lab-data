Fractnrei of 29 INJTTKIES OF THE HEAD Skull. Compression.—Compression of the brain may be pro- compression, duced in several ways, e. g. from the presence of— 1. Depressed bone. 2. Blood extravasated upon the surface of tbe brain or its membranes, or into its substance. 3. Pus formed within the skull. 4. Foreign bodies lodged within the skull. In the following table the main points of diagnosis between concussion and compression are laid down : Tahle sliowing Chief Points of Distinction between Con- cussion and Compression of Brain. Onset of symptoms Mental faculties Respiration Pulse Skin Tempera- ture Pupils Concussion. Immediately after the receipt of the injury Partial insensibility: patient can be roused to answer questions Quiet, shallow, ii-regu- lar Quick, weak, irregu- lar or intermittent Cold and clammy Lowered Often contracted: sen- sible to light Compression. If due to extravasation of blood, the injury is imme- diately followed by symp- toms of concussion; these may pass off, and then after an interval of more or less perfect consciousness, those of compression set in; or, ■without any return of con- sciousness, the symptoms of concussion may speedily pass into those of compres- sion. If due to depressed bone, pus, or foreign bodies cf. (39 ; 2, 3). Complete or profound insen- sibility. Slow, laboured, stertorous. Slow and full. May be cool, but often hot and perspiring. Normal or increased. Dilated or unequal: sluggisli or insensible to light. Diagnosis of Con- cussion and Compression.

AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA 193 „ , . ^ „ Paralysis of Mus- cles of Vocal h. Unilateral.—The voice is altered and often assumes '^"^'^'j^ a falsetto character. Laryngoscopical examination shows that the vocal cord on the affected side does not act during attempts at phonation. 2. ParaZysis 0/a6(Zwcfors (crico-arytenoidei postici). i. a. Bilateral.—The voice is not much affected, but may be harsh ; there is considerable dyspnoea with noisy stridulous inspiration. Laryngoscopical examination shows that the vocal cords lie close together near the median line, and do not separate when an inspiration is taken. 6. Unilateral.—The voice is not much affected, but more or less dyspnoea is present, with noisy inspiration. Laryngoscopical examination shows that the affected vocal cord does not move during respiration, but lies near the median line. 3. Paralysis of tensors fcrico-thyroidei).—The voice becomes deep and hoarse, and the production of high notes is difficult or impossible. Laryngoscopical examination shows that the surfaces of the vocal cords are not quite horizontal and their edges not perfectly straight. 4<. Paralysis of relaxors (thyro-arytenoidei).— In paralysis of these muscles, whose office it is to relax the vocal cords, the ligamentous part of the glottis remains open, while juxtaposition of the arytenoid cartilages takes place. On laryngoscopical examination a minute elliptical opening may often be discovered between the cords. 325. In spa.sm of the muscles of the glottis the vocal Spasm of Glottis, cords suddenly become approximated to one another; if the orifice of the glottis is completely closed, there will be complete arrest of respiration and apnoea if 13

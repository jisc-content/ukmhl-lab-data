On exami- nation with a speculum, the perforation, if of small size, will be usually evident as a minute opening, or it may be occupied by a drop of fluid, which sometimes exhibits distinct pulsation ; if the patient be directed to close his mouth and nostrils, and then forcibly expire, bubbles of air will be often seen to pass through the opening. When the perforation is of large size and almost the whole of the membrane is gone, the inner wall of the middle ear, with the remains of the ossicles, will be exposed to view, the mucous membrane lining its interior will present a red and granular appearance, and the promontory can often be detected as a rounded prominence. Otorrhoea (350) is generally present, the pus being secreted by the lining membrane of the middle ear, and when this condition has continued for some time, polypi (360) not unfrequently make their appearance, growing from the interior of the tympanum and projecting through the perforation. More or less deafness will be present, the loss of hearing varying considerably in different cases. Rupture. 355. Bupture of the membrana tympani may be pro- duced as the result of a penetrating wound from with- out ; or it may accompany a fracture of the base of the skull (38) ; in other cases it may result from a blow on the ear, or from simple concussion, such as that pro- duced by a loud report; or it may occur during fits of sneezing, coughing, blowing the nose, &c. The injury will be attended by more or less haemorrhage (351) ; on examination with a speculum, the rent or laceration will be apparent. Deafness will be generally present, vary- ing in degree, but as the rupture generally readily

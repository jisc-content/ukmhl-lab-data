AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS 69 the antrum, characterised by expansion of its walls, so that the cheek is rendered round and prominent, and. the floor of the orbit, roof of the mouth, and nasal cavity are all more or less encroached upon, semi-elastic to the touch, and when the expansion is extreme, giving rise to the sensation of egg-shell crackling upon pres- sure, is hydrops antri or dropsy of the antrum, a condition which was fonnerly looked upon as due to obstruction of the aperture leading from the antrum to the nostril and consequent retention of secretion, but which is now known to be dependent upon a cystic degeneration of the glandular follicles of the mucous lining of the antrum, the contents of the cysts con- sisting, not of true mucus, but of a glairy mucoid or a thin brownish serous fluid. 105. Dentigerous Cyst.â€”A cystic tumour with smooth outline, painless, and of slow growth, occasionally reaching a considerable size, and then characterised by egg-shell crackling on pressure, is a dentigerous cyst, due to the irritation of some tooth, usually a permanent one, which has been misplaced or ill-developed. An important symptom in the diagnosis of this aftection is the absence from the mouth of some tooth or teeth, which have not appeared or which have never been extracted. 106. Fibrous Tumours not uncommonly spring fi"om the antrum or body of the jaw, independent of any connections with the gums (cf. Epulis, 162), and are characterised by their slow growth, regular outline, and uniform firm consistence. Small polypoid growths, not unlike those found in the nasal fossa (84), occasionally spring from the mucous lining of the antrum ; in some cases the only symptom marking their presence is the discharge of a clear fluid from the nostril (88).

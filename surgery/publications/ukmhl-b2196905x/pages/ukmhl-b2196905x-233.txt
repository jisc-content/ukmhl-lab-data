THE EARâ€”AFFECTIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAR 213 poiypi, externally, projecting from the external meatus as an irregular mass of a reddish colour. It appears to originate in an excessive growth of the granulation tissue which is generally found to line the middle ear in cases of chronic purulent catarrh, for it is by a subsequent development of the granulation tissue into fibrous or fibre-cellular tissue that the little tumour, or polypoid growth, is eventually produced. A polypus is usually accompanied by a purulent dis- charge from the external meatus, and deafness is gene- rally present, for independently of the condition of the middle ear which usually co-exists, the polypus will itself mechanically interrupt the passage of sound to the labyrinth. Total deafness is not, however, usually present, unless the auditory canal is completely oc- cluded. In cases where the external meatus becomes com- pletely blocked up, the polj pus may, by preventing the free discharge of pus, induce purulent absorption, or meningitis, or cerebral abscess may be produced (369). 361. Inflammation of the Membrane lining the Mastoid Disease of Mas- Cells, in many cases going on to suppuration, and lead- ing to caries or necrosis of their bony walls, is not uncommonly met with in cases of disease of the middle ear (358). This condition is characterised by pain and tenderness over the mastoid process, with more or less redness and swelling behind the ear. If suppuration occurs, the pus may make its way internally through the inner wall of the mastoid cavity into the cavity of the skull, a result which is often followed by fatal con- sequences ; or it may continue to discharge through the middle ear and external meatus ; or, making its way externally through the outer wall of the mastoid cells, an abscess may form behind the ear (14), and

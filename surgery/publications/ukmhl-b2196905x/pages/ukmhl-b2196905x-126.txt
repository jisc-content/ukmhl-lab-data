106 EEGIONAL SUEGEBY tion. Botli glands are usually affected, projecting as pale, indurated, somewhat nodular masses from between the pillars of the fauces into the interior of the pharynx, where they sometimes meet and touch each other in the middle line. In some cases their surface becomes affected with superficial ulceration. As a consequence, deglutition and respiration are more or less interfered with. The sense of hearing is often impaired ("throat dea.fness") (358), owing to thickening and congestion of the surrounding mucous membrane causing obstruction of the orifices of the Eustachian tubes. The patient speaks with a pecuhar nasal twang, snores loudly at night, and breathes with the mouth half open. The mucous membrane of the back of the pharynx is often much thickened and relaxed (176), and the lymphatic glands at the sides of the neck are not uu- commonly also enlarged and perceptible beneath the skin (248). . The enlargement of the tonsils is, m many cases, the result of obstruction of the ducts of the gland, which leads to retention of mucous secretion withm the follicles, and this is followed by chronic inflammatory changes in the surrounding tissue, syphilitic uicera- 171. Ulceration of the Tonsils very commonly occurs as the result of constitutional syphilis. Small, round ulcers, with sharply cut edges, of a superficial nature, are often present in the earlier stages, affectmg both the tonsils, fauces, and back of pharynx, while at a later period deep circular ulcers are often found due to softening and breaking down of gummatous deposits. This condition is diagnosed from epitheliomatous ulce- ration (172) by the fact that both tonsils, as also neighbouring parts, are usually similarly affected, by

In acquired syphilis a deposit of gummatous material often occurs in the soft tissues of the hard palate, in many cases involving also the periosteum covering the bone. This usually shows itself as a soft, elastic swelling upon the roof of the mouth, often in the median Hne, varying in size from a pea to a walnut, or even larger; if not absorbed under treatment, it will probably soften and break down, giving rise to super- ficial ulceration, or if extending deeply, it will probably expose a necrosed condition of the palatal process of the superior maxilla, and in many cases an opening will result (164), forming a communication between the buccal and nasal cavities. In children, the subjects of congenital syphilis, well- defined tumours of a similar nature are sometimes seen ; they are most common between the ages of six and twelve, and may attain the size of a walnut, or even larger. A similar deposit of gummy material may occur in the substance of the soft palate, giving rise to the presence of a small tumour, varying in size from a pea to a bean; as the result of softening and breaking down of this deposit, ulceration, perforation, and destruction, more or less extensive, of the soft palate is very liable to ensue (163).

]14 REGIONAL SUEGERY periosteum covering the anterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae. In the early stage, the diagnosis of these affections is often a difficult matter ; from post-pharyngeal abscess (182), which is generally found at an earlier age, they can usually be distinguished by the absence of a feeling of true fluctuation, and also of any evidence of disease of the cervical vertebrae (304). G-ummata and sarcomata are most commonly found in adults, and in the former case there -^ill usually be a history or other evidences of syphilis, and the swelhng will either disappear under treatment, or softening and breaking down may form a deep ulcer on the posterior wall of the pharynx, and be followed by necrosis or caries of the anterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae. Sarcomata are distinguished by their smooth surface; their soft semi-elastic consistence with absence of fluc- tuation ; by the fact that they are uninfluenced by treatment, but steadily increase in size, extending up- wards and downwards along the anterior surface of the vertebrae, and also laterally, involving adjacent structures ; at the same time they grow forwards into the interior of the pharynx, producing serious pressure effects, and ultimately cause death either from asphyxia or interference with deglutition. mesandNe- 185. Caries or Necrosis of the anterior surface of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae forming the posterior wall of the pharynx is generally the primary cause of post-pharyngeal abscess (182) ; it may follow the soften- ing and breaking down of gummatous deposits (184), or the formation of a simple abscess in this situation. 186. Paralysis of the Muscles of the pharynx is some- mSLÂ°^ times met with, the result of the same causes which produce a similar condition in the oesophagus (190).

EEGIONAI, SUEGEEY 60 jects" belong to a medium type between the two just described. " Sucb a type would include what is known as ' p'^etty struma.' The general features of individuals, so termed, belong to the so-called ' phleg- matic ' type ; but the coarseness of the features is toned down ; the lips would be called' full,' not tumid, and a coarse flabbiness would subside into a pretty plump condition of the body. The skin may not be thin and fine, but it is soft, white, and clear. The general ex- pression is not absolutely apathetic, but would be termed rather gentle and eminently feminine."* The various affections to which the parts about the head and neck are commonly liable in these so-called strumous or scrofulous subjects are as follows : 1. ^fcm.—Various eruptions on the scalp and face: eczema, impetigo, lichen, lupus, ulceration of face (44). Eczema of the auricle and skin behind it. Otorrhoea (350). Strumous ulcerations (272), scars (273), and sinuses (271) about the neck. 2.

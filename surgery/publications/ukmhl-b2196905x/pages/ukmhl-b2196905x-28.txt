Acquired ^ KEGIONAL STTEGEET Tmnonrs. may occur in either the secondary or tertiary stage of the constitutional affection. In the secondary node, the periosteum, thickened and inflamed, is raised up and separated from the bone by a more or less fibrinous effusion. Along with this there is generally associated some inflammation of the surface of the bone itself. The simple inflammatory swelling thus formed may become absorbed and dis- appear, or it may ossify and remain as a permanent periosteal thickening, sometimes termed a "syphilitic exostosis." In the tertiary node there is, in addition to simple periostitis, a deposit of gummatous matter in and upon the surface of the bone, which is very liable to soften and break down, exposing a carious or necrosed condi- tion of the bone itself. Syphilitic nodes are often multiple, and usually attended by considerable pain, which is worse at night. *. Rheumatic. The rheumatic node is a much rarer affection than the preceding; it is usually single, and unattended with much pain, even at night. It is softer and more fluctu- ating than the syphilitic variety. The cranium is the favourite seat of this form of local periostitis, which is due to simple inflammatory thickening of the periosteum and fibrinous effusion between it' and the bone. c. strumous. The so-called "strumous" node differs from the pre- ceding varieties in the fact that it is hardly ever a purely periosteal swelling. In this form there is thick- ening and expansion of the osseous tissue itself, but the swelling is chiefly due to infiltration of the periosteum and superjacent soft tissues with inflammatory exuda- tion, which is very prone to break down, exposing a soft and carious condition of the bone. A variety of strumous node is described as due to a

TUMOURS OF SCALP AND VAULT OF CRANIUM 3 2. Meningocele, Encephalocele, Hydrencephalocele are the terms applied toâ€” Congenital tumours formed by a protrusion or hernia of the membranes of the brain or the brain itself, through an opening in the skull, either in the line of one of the sutures, or at some spot where the cranial bones are deficient at birth. In a Meningocele, the protrusion consists only of a sac formed by the membranes (dura mater and arachnoid) filled with subarachnoid fluid. In an EncepJialocele, the brain itself is contained in the external tumour. In a Hydrencephalocele, in addition to subarachnoid fluid, the brain itself also protrudes to some extent into the external tumour. Another variety of hydrencepha- locele is described where, in addition to brain sub- stance, the tumour contains a portion of one or both ventricles filled with fluid. These tumours form soft, rounded or oval swellings, attached by a broad base, or in some cases by a narro J pedicle, varying from the size of a pea to that of a tumour exceeding the child's head. When large, the integuments are much thinned and the skin is often of a bluish colour. Fluctuation is generally present. The tumour in- creases in size, and becomes more tense on strong expi- ratoiy efforts, as when the child cries or coughs - it is partly or entirely reducible within the cavity of the skull, and after reduction the aperture in the bone can be felt. In many cases, cerebral symptoms (from pres sure upon the brain) are produced upon their reduc" tion. Pulsation, synchronous with the pulse, can be detected when the tumour consists mainly ;f l>rain substance. '' Congenilal Tumours. Meiiiiistocele. Eacephalocele. Hj-dreuceplia- locele.

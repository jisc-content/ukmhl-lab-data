It may also become the se^t of syphilitic ulceration, epithelioma, lupus, or rodent ulcer (335). Tumours. 330. The auricle may become the seat of various tumours or morbid growths; those most commonly met with are sebaceous cysts (322), hsematomata (331) fibrous or keloid tumours (333), and nsevoid growths (334). Epitheliomata, enchondromata, and sarcomata are of rare occurrence. It may also become the seat of tophi or chalk-stones (337). Hsematomaor 331.

Two varieties are described, the idiopathic and traumatic, according as the extravasation of blood takes place spontaneously or as the result of injury. The idiopathic form usually appears in those who present evidence of insanity, and it is believed to de- pend upon some morbid condition of the brain, in con- sequence of which dilatation of the vessels of the ear, followed by rupture and effusion of blood, is produced; when occurring spontaneously in apparently healthy individuals, who present no evidence of mental disease, a "hEematoma auris" should therefore be regarded with suspicion, as indicating a tendency to the develop- ment of insanity. Its formation is usually preceded by flushing and congestion of the auricle, which feels hot and painful; effusion of blood then rapidly takes place, and in the course of a few hours the swelling reaches the size of a walnut or small egg, presenting itself as a somewhat hot, tense, and fluctuating tumour, situated most com-

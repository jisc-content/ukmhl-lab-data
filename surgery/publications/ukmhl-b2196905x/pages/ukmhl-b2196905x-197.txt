Sudden death may he produced when the axis is affected, as the result of giving way of the ligaments which hold in position the odontoid process; under these circumstances, this portion of bone being suddenly displaced backwards presses upon the medulla oblon- gata and causes sudden death. 305. Spondylitis Befonnans,* a form of Chronic Bheu- Ei^umaUc matic Arthritis, may attack the cervical portion of the " Spondylitis spine, the vertebrae becoming anchylosed together by masses of bone deposited upon their external surface, at the same time that absorption of their articular surfaces and intervertebral cartilages takes place. This condition is characterised by rigidity and stiff- ness, with more or less thickening of the affected portion of the spine, and is distinguished from cervical caries (304) by the fact that tlie patient is usually more advanced in years; by the absence of much, if any, tendency to destruction of the bodies of the vertebrae and consequent production of angular curvature, though there may be a general bowing of the spine (306) ; by the absence of any tendency to suppuration and the formation of abscess ; by the presence or history of other symptoms of rheumatism, though in many cases the spine may be the only part affected ; by the charac- ter of the pain, which is often worse at night and influ- enced by the weather; by the more extensive nature of the affection, the whole of the spinal column being â–  often involved, as also its articulations with the ribs, so that the movements of the chest walls are often inter- fered with, respiration being in advanced cases entirely abdominal. 306.

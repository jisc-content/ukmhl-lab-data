They are characterised by their rapid growth and serious pressure effects (e. g. pressing upon the spinal cord, or interfering with deglutition and respiration) : if the patient lives long enough they are generally followed by secondary deposits in internal organs (lungs, liver, &c.).

Carcinoma. Carcinoma may in rare cases attack the bones of the spinal column as a secondary affection, most commonly consecutive to cancer of the breast.* " The symptoms of malignant disease in the spine are of the same general character as those of other destruc- tive diseases in the vertebrae.

* Hutchinson, ' Clinical Lectures,' plate 43. 83 AFFECTIONS OF THE TEETH 126. In tlie so-called " craggy teeth " the enamel on " Craggy Teetii." the lower halves of the crowns of the tipper incisors and canines, or the upper halves of the crowns of the lower incisors and canines, " is absent, and its deficiency is bounded by an abrupt transverse line which deeply grooves the tooth. The denuded part of the tooth shows strong ridges, and is by no means in the soft, pitted, and crumbling condition often seen in the teeth of stomatitis." " I believe that a tendency to the ' craggy teeth' is sometimes a matter of family inheritance, and they may sometimes probably be produced by mercury. They are to be carefully distinguished from those of syphilis." *

The glands, as they more or less rapidly increase in size, may remain separate from each other, or becoming confluent, form large lobulated tumours, which present a smooth surface and are generally of a softish, semi- elastic consistence; at first they are freely movable beneath the skin and upon subjacent parts, but as the disease progi'esses they become fixed, owing to infiltra- tion of surrounding structures, often running a course, if the patient lives long enough, very similar to that seen in cases of lymphosarcoma (251) ; in fact, " Hodg- kin's disease" might be described as a very generalised form of lymphosarcoma. 250. Carcinoma may attack the lymphatic glands of *• Caicmoma the neck as a •primary affection in the form of epithe- lioma, scirrhus, or encephaloid cancer, but this is of very rare occurrence;* in the majority of cases it is of a secondary nature, being consecutive to carcinoma attacking some neighbouring part, as, for example, epithelioma of the tongue, lip, mucous lining of the cheek, tonsil, or oesophagus; in the case of cancer of the breast, the glands at the root of the neck above the clavicle often become secondarily affected. The affected glands rapidly enlarge, forming an irre- gular, ill-defined, and nodulated tumour, of hard, and in some cases of almost stony consistence ; as the sur- rounding tissues become involved, the tumour becomes fixed and immovable, and the skin covering it becoming * Dreschfeld, ' Brit.

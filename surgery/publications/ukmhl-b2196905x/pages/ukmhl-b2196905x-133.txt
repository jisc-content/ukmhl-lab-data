113 AFFECTIONS OF THE PHARYNX fluctuating or of elastic consistence, pushing forwards the posterior wall of the pharynx, interfering more or less with deglutition, and, if of large size, offering con- siderable obstruction to respiration. It may occur at any age, but is most commonly found in children, and, in the majority of cases, on careful examination, evidences of cervical caries (304) will be seen to be present. If occurring in adults without any evidence of spinal disease, and where the sense of fluctuation cannot be readily obtained, there may be some difficulty in dis- tinguishing between this affection and a tumour origi- nating in the same situation (184), If left to itself, a post-pharyngeal abscess may burst into the pharynx, or, burrowing laterally, the pus may pass forwards beneath the sterno-mastoid, and point either at the side or fore part of the neck (256). 183. Pharyngocele, i.e. dilatation and pouching of the Piiaryngoceie. lower part of the pharynx (cf. 193), 184. Tumours are sometimes met with springing Tumours, from the back of the pharynx, either of a simple or malignant nature ; in many instances, especially when of softish and semi-elastic consistence, pushing before them the mucous membrane, they closely simulate a post-pharyngeal abscess, and recourse to exploratory puncture may be necessary in order to distinguish be- tween the two affections. The tumours most commonly met with in this situation are eitherâ€” Sarcomata, springing from the periosteum, " perios- Saicomatn. teal," or originating in the interior of the bodies of the vertebrae, " central " (312 a). Gummata, the result of deposit of gummatous material ^ uranmtn. in the soft tissues of the back of the pharynx, or in the 8

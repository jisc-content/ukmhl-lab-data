StomatUis. AFFECTIONS OF THE MOTTTH 85 whitish spots, consisting of epithelial cells mingled with the sporales and filaments of the fungus, appear on reddened patches, presenting an appearance not unlike that of curdled milk. In children, the subjects of congenital syphilis, the mucous membrane of the mouth is very subject to attacks of inflammation, coming on shortly after birth, following closely or accompanying the inflammation of the interior of the nose, which gives rise to the character- istic " snufBes " (77). The gangrenous form of stomatitis or " cancrum oris is described (53). The mercurial form of stomatitis is described (164). 128. The mucous membrane of the cheeks may be the seat of psoriasis (133) ; ichthyosis (134); mucous tubercles (139); syphilitic ulceration, superficial or deep (135), or epithelioma (135); and in each instance the appearance will closely resemble that which is found when the tongue is similarly affected with the same disease. Simple ulceration, affecting the mucous lining of the cheeks and angles of the mouth, usually of a superficial nature, is often found in association with the irritable (135), or dyspeptic (135) ulceration of the tongue, <5r in consequence of salivation by mercury (164) ; in young children it is often produced as the result of the dif- ferent forms of stomatitis (127). 129. A Banula, or Sublingual Cyst, is a cystic tumour found on the floor of the mouth beneath the tongue, the result generally of dilatation of one of the sublingual ducts or mucous follicles present in this situation. It usually appears as a semi-transparent, fluctuating, globular swelling, the size of a walnut or small egg, often considerably displacing the tongue, and containing 4. Syphilitic. " 5.

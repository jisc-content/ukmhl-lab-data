Ftaeture. ^''''^ REGIONAL SUEGEET power in the sphincter ani and the muscular walls of the bladder, there are involuntary evacuations of faeces and retention of urine, subsequently followed by incon- .tinence,the result of overflow from a distended bladder. An accumulation of gas takes place in the intestines, giving rise to tympanitis, and if the patient lives long enough cystitis is set up, the urine becoming ammonia- cal and alkaline in reaction. Sensation is entirely lost in the parts supplied by nerves | given off below the seat of fracture, bed-sores soon form, and priapism is generally present. The temperature of the paralysed part varies, being sometimes much higher than normal, while in other cases it is considerably lowered. Death generally results in the course of a few days (in the majority of cases within three) from a gradual process of asphyxia, the result of imperfect respiration. When the displacement of the fragments is slight, the parts below the seat of injury may be only partially paralysed; under these circumstances considerable pain is generally experienced at the seat of fracture, and hyperaesthesia is often found to exist at the line of junction of the paralysed and sound parts of the body, owing to compression and irritation of the nerves that issue from the intervertebral foramen at the seat of fracture. If the fracture involve the sixth cervical vertebra, the upper extremities will be only partially paralysed. In the majority of cases some abnormal projection or displacement of the spinous processes will be percepti- ble at the seat of injury. If the fracture involve only the top of the spinous process, mobility of the fractured portion of bone, with crepitus and more or less stiffness, swelling, and pain

Syphilitic. Syphilitic TJlceration may occur in either the early or late stages of the constitutional affection, assuming either a superficial or a deep form. Secondary or Superficial Ulceration usually appears in the form of fissures or cracks, though in some cases superficial ulcers of round, oval, or irregular shape are also found. These are generally multiple, occurring at the anterior part of the tongue, especially on the tip, sides, and under surface, and they are often accom- panied by similar ulcerations upon the insides of the cheeks and at the angles of the mouth. The ulcers are generally of a painful nature, and after they have healed leave behind them smooth, shining cicatrices and milk-white scars. The tongue is at the same time often affected in other places with patches of psoriasis (133), or chronic superficial glossitis (132). Tertiary or Beep Ulceration is generally the result of the softening and breaking down of a gumma (141) which has formed in the substance or on the surface of the tongue. It is generally situated in the median line in the neighbourhood of the fibrous raphe, and usually on the middle or posterior surface of the dorsum. For the diagnosis from epithelioma (cf. 136). 4.

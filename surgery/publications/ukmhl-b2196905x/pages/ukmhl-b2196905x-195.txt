INJtrniES AND AFFECTIONS OF CERVICAL SPINE 175 Fracture. may te the only symptoms necessarily connected with the injury. When the fracture involves the cilio-spinal region of the spinal cord, contraction of the pupil is often observed. (The " cilio-spinal centre," from which oculo-pupillary fibres issue controlling the movements of the iris, is contained in that portion of the cord which corresponds with the two lower cervical and two upper dorsal vertebrae.) 304. The earliest symptoms of caries, which usually Ce'"<=^' Cariea. commences in the bodies of the cervical vertebrae (less frequently in the intervertebral, cartilages), are as follows: 1. Stiffness and rigidity of the neck, so that the head is constantly fixed in a certain position; nodding and rotation of the head are impossible, and the patient, when he wishes to look round, has to twist the whole body, owing to loss of motion between the affected vertebrae, and muscular spasm, the result of reflex irritation. 2. Pain, at the seat of the disease or radiated to some distant part, either constant or paroxysmal, and increased on certain movements, e. g. on a sudden jar or shock, as, for example, on coming downstairs, jump- ing from a chair on to the floor, on a sudden cough, or sneeze, &c. Pain is usually experienced on rotating, tapping, or pressing downward the head, and in some cases on tapping or applying a hot sponge to the affected por- tion of the spine. In disease of the first or second cervical vertebrae, pain is often referred to the back of the head, following the distribution of the suboccipital and great occipital nerves. In disease of the lower cervical vertebrae, pain is often

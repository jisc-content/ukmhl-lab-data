INJURIES AND AFFECTIONS OF CERVICAL SPINE 181 g^^^^ and membranes of the cord (dura mater and both layers of ai'achnoid), usually contains in its interior subaracb- noid or cerebro-spinal fluid, and sometimes in addition the pia mater and spinal cord itself. Less frequently the fluid contents of the tumour, containing no sugar, consists simply of the serous secre- tion of the arachnoid space itself, and not, as in the previous case, of cerebro-spinal or subarachnoid fluid ;* under these circumstances, the coverings of the sac are also different, comprising the integument, dura mater, and outer layer of the arachnoid alone. In very rare instances a protrusion of the membranes may occur between or through the bodies of the verte- brae, on either their anterior or lateral surface, giving rise to the presence of a tumour on the front or lateral aspect of the spinal column, It usually appears as a soft, fluctuating tumour, par- tially or almost entirely reducible, increasing in size and becoming tense when the child cries or makes any violent expiratory efforts. When of small size, the stin covering the tumour may be of its normal colour and appearance, but when large, it is much thinned and in some cases almost transparent. 312. Hyperostosis or enlargement and thickening of Hyp the cervical vertebrae may be due to simple overgrowth or hypertrophy, or it may be the result of osteitis de- formans (308) or chronic rheumatic arthritis (305). In these affections, irregular masses of bone (osteo- phytes) are sometimes found overspreading or project- ing from the surfaces of the vertebrae, causing anchy- losis, and in some cases producing more or less thicken- ing and fulness at the back and sides of the neck. * Gould,' Lancet,' 1882, vol. i, p. 737.

68 REGIONAL SUE.GEET Tiiiiiours of Upper — tumour of the antrum grows simultaneously in all these directions, producing exophthalmos, obstruction of nostril, prominence of the cheek, and bulging of the roof of the mouth. When springing from the anterior s^irface of the Superior Maxilla, it causes a projection of the cheek, dipping down between the gums and the soft structures of the face. As the tumour increases in size it may grow backwards into the interior of the antrum, and thus secondarily implicate that cavity. When springing from behind the Superior Maxilla, the upper jaw will at first be pushed bodily forwards, but as the antrum becomes secondarily involved any of the walls of this cavity may subsequently become ex- panded and rendered prominent. 13. Simple or A Simple Tumour is characterised by its slower Malignant. gj.Q^th, its firmer consistence (except when cystic), its more regular and rounded outline, and by the non- implication of the neighbouring lymphatic glands and the skin covering it. A Malignant Tumour is characterised by its more rapid growth, its softer and more elastic consistence, its ill-defined outline, its tendency to infiltrate the skin and project as a fiingating mass, and, in the case of carci- noma, its implication of the lymphatic glands in the neighbourhood of the jaw. y. Cystic or Cystic are distinguished from solid tumours by the semi-elastic and even fluctuating character of the swell- ing, and by the presence in some cases of a distinct egg-shell or parchment-like crackling on palpation, due to extreme thinning by absorption of the bone covering them. 104.

AFFECTIONS OF THE ORBIT 141 ^.^.^.^yaal Tumours and 3. Tumours of the nasal fossae, e.g. fibrous or sarco- matous polypi (84), cancerous polypi (84). Cf. naso- orbital tumour (84). 4. Tumours connected with the base of the skull, temporal fossae, or any adjacent part. In all these cases careful examination of the adjacent parts, and an inquiry into the history of the case, will reveal the fact that the orbit was only secondarily in- volved, as a result of extension of the growth or swell- ing into its interior from without. The symptoms when its cavity is involved will be the same as in the case of tumours originating in its interior (235), preceded of course by evidence of disease in some adjacent part.

AFFECTIONS OF SCALP AND VAULT OF CBANItTM 21 Hypertrophy of Cranium. d. Osteo- malaciii. and nasal fossae, gradually become encroached upon, so that after a time these cavities are often found more or less completely obliterated. In certain cases of Osteomalacia the bones of the skull are after death found to be thickened, irregular in structure, and very porous, presenting a peculiar mor- tary appearance. Hypertrophy of the cranium, due to thickening of its bones, must not be confounded with the enlargement or expansion of its cavity, dependent upon chronic hydro- cephalus (34). 34. In Chronic hydrocephalus, owing to accumulation Hydrocephalus, of fluid in the ventricles of the brain and subarachnoid space, the cranial bones become expanded and thinned, sometimes to such an extent as to yield a crackling sensation on pressure; the fontanelles and sutures are at the same time widened out and rendered unduly prominent, so that in many cases fluctuation can be distinctly felt. The head is consequently much enlarged and the forehead projects; the eyeballs protrude, owing to pres- sure from within upon the orbital j)lates of the frontal bone. In comparison with the size of the cranium, the lower part of the face looks unusually small. Hydro- cephalus is either congenital or comes on soon after birth, and is in many cases found associated with rickets. 35. The scalp is not unfrequently the seat of one of the following affections: in two instances. Tinea ton- surans and Tinea favosa, the condition is dependent upon the presence of a vegetable parasite.

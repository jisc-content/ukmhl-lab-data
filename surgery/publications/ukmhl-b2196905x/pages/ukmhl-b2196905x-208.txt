Chronic Laryngi- REGIONAL SURGERY lis. ing tlie epiglottis and lining the larynx; this is very prone to break down and ulcerate, in consequence of which erosion and destruction of the cartilages are not uncommonly produced. Syphilitic laryngitis may be met with either as a secondary or tertiary aifection. In the secondary stage, the affection of the larynx may be due to the spread of inflammation from the throat (177), or less commonly, the larynx itself may be primarily involved, and erosion and superficial ulceration of its mucous lining may be produced. In the tertiary stage, there is often a deposit of gum- matous material in the mucous and submucous tissues of the larynx, and this, softening and breaking down, is often followed by ulceration, which extending deeply may cause extensive destruction of the cartilages and vocal cords. The symptoms characteristic of chronic laryngitis are as follows : a feeling of discomfort and uneasiness about the larynx, worse after speaking or reading aloud; alteration in the voice, which may be hoarse, harsh and cracked, or much weakened and almost entirely lost. Cough is generally present, of a constant irritating and tickling nature, or it may come on from time to time in severe paroxysms; it is usually attended by more or less expectoration, and the patient has often a constant desire to clear the throat: dysphagia is sometimes com- plained of. When the larynx is much obstructed, either from chronic thickening or from oedema of the soft parts, more or less dyspnoea will be produced, with stridulous inspiration; and when ulceration has taken place severe spasm of the glottis will be liable to occur. Ulceration. 318. Ulceration of the mucous membrane lining the interior of the larynx may be due to several causes, e. g.:

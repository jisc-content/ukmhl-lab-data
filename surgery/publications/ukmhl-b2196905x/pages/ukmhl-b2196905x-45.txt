CHAPTER ni INJURIES or THE HEAD 36. As a consequence of some local injury without Contusion, external wound, blood may be effused in small quantity into the tissues of the scalp, producing an ecchymosis or simple bruise ; when, however, the injury is followed by considerable extravasation of blood, a hsematoma or blood-tumour (20) is formed. 37. Wounds of the scalp may involve only the soft Scaip-wounds, structures which enter into its formation, or they may be complicated with fracture of the skull; owing to the extreme vascularity of the scalp they are often accompanied by considerable hsemorrhage, and when the external wound is of small size, as in the case of a simple puncture, the blood may accumulate in consider- able quantity beneath the tissues of the scalp. 38. Fractures of the Skull may be divided into fracture ^'^'^gl''^" °^ of the vault and fracture of the base, or, again, into — fractvire of the vault and base combined. Fractures of the Vault may be simple or compound, a. Fractures of that is, without or with external wound; they may be classified as follows, according as one only of the tables, or as the whole thickness of the skull is involved. 1. Fracture of the outer table only. This form, in which the outer table only is depressed and driven into the diploii, is most common in the neighbourhood of the frontal sinuses, where a considerable depression may be

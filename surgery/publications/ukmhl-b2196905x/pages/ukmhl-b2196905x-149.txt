CHAPTER XVII APFECTIONS OF THE LACHRYMAL APPARATUS 218. The lachrymal gland may become the seat of iniammation of , 1 • ■ n ■ ''''^ Lachrymal acute or chrome inflammation, and in either case the Giand. process may go on to suppuration and the formation of an abscess ; the enlarged gland will form an unnatural projection at the upper and outer margin of the orbit, and when the swelling is extreme, the eyeball will be displaced downwards and inwards. If an abscess forms, fluctuation will be evident, and if unopened, the pus will generally make its way exter- nally, often discharging itself through the skin of the upper eyelid; in many cases a lachrymal fistula will result (220). 219. Cysts of the Lachrymal Gland—Bacnjops—due c>sts of Laciirv- to obstruction and distension of the ducts of the gland, "Dac'ySs.-- are sometimes seen; they usually present themselves as small, well-defined, elastic swellings in the situation of the gland, over which the skin is freely movable. In some cases they burst externally, giving rise to the formation of a fistulous opening in the upper eye- lid, through which there is a constant discharge of lachrymal secretion. 220. Small openings are sometimes seen in the outer Fistula of portion of the upper eyelid, leading down to the lachry- Gkidf™"' mal gland, and discharging a muco-purulent or clearish fluid. 9

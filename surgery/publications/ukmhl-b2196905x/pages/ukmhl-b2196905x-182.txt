The cicatrix, which is left after healing has taken place in the case of stmmous ulceration of the neck (or indeed in the case of any slowly healing wound), is usually somewhat deep coloured, dense, thick, heaped-up, puckered, and cord-like, being raised above the level of the surrounding integument in the form of little ridges or tongues of skin. 274. The cancerous ulcer is sometimes seen in the neck, in cases where the lymphatic glands having be- come affected with carcinoma (250), the skin covering them has also become infiltrated and the seat of ulcera- tion* The appearance of the ulcer, formed under these cir- cumstances, is always very characteristic; its base is generally irregular, discharging a fetid, sanious pus, its edges are raised, everted, and considerably thick- ened, while the STirrounding integuments are much in- durated. This form of ulceration usually occurs at a much later period of life than the strumous (272), and on ex- amination evidence of carcinoma will generally be found in some neighbouring part. 275. Rodent Ulcer is sometimes found attacking the neck, presenting an appearance similar to that described (p. 34). 276. Fistulous Openings in the NecJc may be due to several different causes. 1. Simple sinuses, due to the non-closure of the cavity of an abscess, are often seen (271). 2. Aerial fistulce, viz. communications with the larynx or trachea, are sometimes found, as the result of wounds involving the air-passages (282). 3. Pharyngeal and oesophageal fistulce, viz. commu- â–  nications with the pharynx oi' oesophagus, are rarely

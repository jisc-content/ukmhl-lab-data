EEGIONAL SUEGEET 88 consistence. The papillae, immensely hypertrophied and overloaded with epithelium, may retain their separate form, or they may be welded together and covered over with a layer of thickened epithelium, which completely conceals them from view, the patches, which are often almost of cartilaginous consistence, then assuming a somewhat smooth appearance. Ichthyosis linguae may present itself under three different forms, viz.: 1. Whitish patches, varying in extent, presenting a smooth surface of cartilaginous or almost horny con- sistence. In some cases the patches are broken up into quadrilateral spaces by slight fissures, which intercross each other. 2. Diffused patches, consisting of filiform papillae, immensely hypertrophied (in some cases a quarter of an inch or more in length), but still retaining their sepa- rate form. 3. In cases where the ichthyotic patches are single, circumscribed, and limited in extent, approaching more in character the warty growths so often seen on the skin, they are often described as " papillomata of the tongue," and, in fact, the ordinary form of the disease itself might be well described as a diffused papilloma- tous condition of the surface of the tongue. This affection is in rare cases congenital. More commonly it is found associated with syphilis, or some cause of local irritation, e.g. smoking, rough or carious teeth, &c. The ichthyotic patches may remain in a stationary condition for many years, or they may slowly extend, causing very little pain or inconvenience. In other in- stances they may ulcerate, and not at all uncommonly they eventually develop into epithelioma, so that we

Dilatation of the oesophaofus (oesopJiaqocele), or " CLsopliagocele." r a \ j. a /j or the lower part of the pharynx (pharyngocele), is generally found associated with stricture; much more rarely it is of congenital origin, or the result of injury, or disease (e.g. ulceration). It is met with in two forms, either as a distinct pouching or diverticulum at some point of the food passage, or as a general dilata- tion of the lower part of the pharynx or of the oeso- phagus itself for a greater or less portion of its length. This condition is characterised by more or less dys- phagia and regurgitation of food after a varying in- terval, along with the usual symptoms of stricture (188) when that condition is present. In rare cases the dilated portion of the tube, when distended with food, is perceptible as a swelling at one side of the neck, which can be emptied and made to disappear on external pressure. Rupture. 194. Rupture of the (Esophagus is a rare accident, which may take place during violent attacks of vomiting, usually in those in whom the walls of the gullet are weakened from disease. It is characterised by acute pain, cessation usually of vomiting, though in some cases vomiting of blood may ensue, emphysema of the neck, and severe collapse, which generally soon terminates in death.

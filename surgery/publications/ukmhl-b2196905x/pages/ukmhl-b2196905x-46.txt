Fractures of Shtll. 26 EEGIONAIi SUEGEEY produced without the inner table being in any way injured. 2. Fracture of the inner table only, without any injury to the outer table, is a rare injury; it may be accompanied by depression of the fragments. 3. Eracture of the whole thickness of the skull—the most common variety—may occur under various forms, viz. a. Simple cracks or fissures—when there is no dis- placement of the fragments. 6. Fracture with depression—when one or more of the fragments is driven inwards. c. Fracture with elevation—when one or more of the fragments is forced outwards ; this is of very rare occurrence. d. Comminuted fracture — when there is extensive splintering of the fragments. e. Punctured fracture—when the injury being caused by a pointed instrument, the outer table is merely perforated, and the inner one extensively splintered and often depressed. /. Starred fracture—when there are numerous fissures radiating from a common centre. g. Gutter or saucer-shaped fractures—where the injury having been caused by a blunt instrument the bone is depressed in a gutter or saucer-like shape, the depression being greater at the centre than at the cir- cumference. In some cases, viz. in young children, where the bones are soft and pliable, the vault of the skull may be in- dented and driven in without being accompanied by any actual fracture beyond a slight yielding or giving way of the substance of the bone, a kind of so-called, green-stick fracture being produced.

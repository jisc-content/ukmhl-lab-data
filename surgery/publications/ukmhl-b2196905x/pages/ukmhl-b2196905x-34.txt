Tumours of Traumatic Origin. REGIONAL STTKGEET Diagnosis of Scematoma from Bejpressed Fracture of Vault of Skull. Pott'8 Puffy Tumour. ScBmatoma. 1. The margin bounding the depression is raised above the level of the surrounding surface of the skull. 2. The margin is rounded, and on pressing the finger-nail upon it an impression can often be made. 3. The outline is regular, and often creseentic. 4. The apparent depression within the ridge will probably yield sufficiently to the pressure of the finger, so that the smooth surface of the skull can be felt below. 5. No symptoms of compres- sion of brain. Fracture. 1. The margin of the depres- sion is on a level with the sur- rounding surface of the skull. 2. The margin is sharp and irregular, and upon pressure no impression can be made upon it. 3. The outline is very vari- able, often irregular. 4. If any bone can be felt at the bottom of the depression it will be loose and irregular. 5. Cerebral symptoms pro- bably present. 22. A circumscribed " pufEv " tumour forming upon the scalp some days after the receipt of an injury (wHcli may or may not have been accompanied by ex- ternal wound), attended by symptoms of inflammation of the brain or its membranes, terminating in coma or paralysis, generally indicates the presence of pus between the bone and dura mater at the seat of injury. The puffy swelling upon the uninjured scalp, or in the neighbourhood of the external wound, when one is present, is the result of a localised periostitis excited by the injury, and the inflammation thus excited ex- tending inwards, and involving in succession the diploe

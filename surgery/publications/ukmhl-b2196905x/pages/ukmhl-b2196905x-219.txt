Accumulation of Cerumen in the external meatus Cerumen, is a very common cause of deafness, whicli may come on gradually, or perhaps more frequently shows itself some- ^hat suddenly. Tinnitus, often of a distressing cha- i-acter, more or less pain or uneasiness, and attacks of giddiness are often present; on examination with a speculum, the collection of wax can he readily detected, and the membrana tympani will he completely hidden from sight. On removing the accumulation, either with a pair of forceps or by syringing, the deafness, if due to this cause alone, will at once disappear, and the drum- head will at the same time be exposed to view. From constant pressure of the cerumen upon the membrana tympani, ulceration of this structure, followed in some cases by perforation, may be produced, giving rise to more or less permanent loss of hearing. 340 A peculiar kind of mould or vegetable fungus, Parasites. -i- . , . , "Aspergil the "Aspergillus," is sometimes met with an the ex- ternal meatus, and in many cases the symptoms pro- duced are very similar to those caused by accumulation of cerumen, viz. loss of hearing, tinnitus, fulness of the ear, and more or less aching pain ; or inflammation of the meatus may be set up, accompanied by a serous

Venotcs Ncdvus.—A more or less prominent swelling, soft and puffy to the touch, at times somewhat lobu- lated, diminished in size on compression, and slowly swelling up again when pressure is removed, without bruit or pulsation, increasing in size during strong ex- piratory efforts, of a blue or purplish colour, is a venous ncevus, involving usually both skin and subcuta- neous tissue. This variety of vascular tumour is often of consider- able size at birth, and, as the result of external irritation, the skin over it not uncommonly becomes abraded or slightly ulcerated. The purely venous nsevi are usually confined to the subcutaneous tissue, those involving the skin only being always of a capillary nature; where, however, both skin and subcutaneous tissue are implicated, the nsevus is generally of the mixed kind, viz. both venous and capil- lary. 5.

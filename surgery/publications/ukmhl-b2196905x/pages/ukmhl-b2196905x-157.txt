AFFECTIONS OF THE OEBIT '^^'^ Timours of Oriit. Periosteum, e.g. nodes (usually syphilitic, 231), fibroma (238), sarcoma (243). Soft tissues of orbit, e.g. sebaceous cyst (207), gum- mata (239), sarcoma (243), carcinoma (243), hydatid cysts (240). Blood-vessels, e.ff. aneurism and pulsating tumours (241), naevus (242). Lachrymal gland, e.ff. inflammatory enlargement (218), new growths (221). 2, Those originating at some point external to the oriit, hut which in their growth have extended into the interior of that cavity (244). The general symptoms attending the presence of an orbital tumour will be as follows, varying of course in degree and severity according to the position and size of the swelling: protrusion of the eyeball (exoph- thalmos) (229), either directly forwards, or in an upward or downward, or lateral direction; limitation of the movements of the eyeball; interference with vision from pressure upon or stretching of the optic nei-ve; epiphora; eversion of the eyelids, and if the cornea is constantly exposed, ulceration and, sloughing of its surface will result. In cases of aneurism of the orbit (241) there will of course be an additional group of symptoms dependent upon the pulsatile nature of the swelling. 236. Exostoses, ivory or cancellous, are sometimes Exostosis, found springing from one of the walls of the orbit and projecting into its interior. They appear as hard, circumscribed, slowly-growing tumours, at times pe- dimculated, at others attached by a broad base. In some cases they may extend from the orbit and involve neighbouring cavities, e.g. antrum, frontal sinuses. (Cf. Leontiasis ossea (33 c), Diffused osteoma (108).

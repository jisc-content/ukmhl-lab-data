REGIONAL STJRGEBY 82 the permanent teeth often exhibit a defective develop- ment of enamel; as a result of this, erosion of the ex- posed dentine readily takes place, and the crown of the tooth presents in consequence an irregular, rugged, discoloured appearance, its surface being pitted and often marked with horizontal groovings; at. the same time the cutting edge is often unusually sharp, owing to the thinness of its covering of enamel. The incisors, canines, and first molars in particular, are usually affected in this manner, the biscuspids and second and third molars, which are developed at a later period (when the causes that arrest the enamel forma- tion are not in action), as a rule altogether escaping. This condition of the teeth must not be confounded with that present in congenital syphilis, consisting, as it does, not so much in alteration of the shape of the teeth as in defective development of enamel; the two conditions are not, however, uncommonly combined, that is to say, a typical syphilitic tooth may present a rocky or honeycombed condition of its crown as the result simply of imperfect development of its covering of enamel. I Rickets 125- Bickets, Struma, or in any condition which is Struma.' associated with defective or depressed nutrition during infancy, when dentition is taking place, the proper development of the teeth is interfered with; hence both temporary and permanent teeth are cut late, they are deficient in enamel, and often present a rocky or pitted appearance, or are marked with transverse lines. The permanent incisors, which may be large, white, and well formed, are often thin and brittle, and their cutting edge is not unfrequently notched and serrated; the teeth generally soon become carious, readily crum- bling and wearing away.

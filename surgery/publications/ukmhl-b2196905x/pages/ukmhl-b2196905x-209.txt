AFFECTIONS OF THE LAEYNX AND TRACHEA 189 ulceration. In simple laryngitis, acute or chronic, ulceration of a superficial character is often present. In phthisical laryngitis, the under surface of the epiglottis, the vocal cords, and adjacent parts often hecome the seat of ulceration, which, in many cases, is the result of the softening and breaking down of depo- sits of tubercle. In syphilitic laryngitis, during the secondary stage, ulceration of a superficial nature is often seen ; while in the tertiary stage, as the result of softening and break- ing down of gummatous deposits, deep ulcers are very apt to form and necrosis of the subjacent cartilages often ensues. If cicatrisation takes place, the contract- ing scars often narrow the calibre of the larynx, and considerable obstruction to respiration is consequently produced. The symptoms indicative of ulceration of the larynx are as follows : hoarseness and alteration in the voice, which may be almost entirely lost; attacks of coughing, with expectoration of pus, blood, and shreds of tissue; dysphagia, pain being especially experienced when the epiglottis is involved; respiration is often noisy ; attacks of spasm of the glottis are liable to occur, giving rise to urgent dyspnoea. On examination with the laryngoscope, the mucous membrane will present evidences of chronic laryngitis (317), and distinct ulcerations will be seen in difierent places. 319.

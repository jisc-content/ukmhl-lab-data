The bones of the cranium are sometimes the seat sarcomata, of sarcomatous growths, which may spring either from the bone or periosteum. Periosteal Sarcomata usually appear as rapidly grow- a. Periosteal, ing tumoui-s connected with the exterior of the bones of the skull. They are commonly multiple, and, though the neighbouring lymphatic glands usually escape, they are soon followed by secondary growths in internal organs, rapidly destroying life. Central Sarcomata usually appear as rapidly growing »■ Central, tumours springing from the diploe of the cranial bones. They closely resemble the preceding in their rapid course and fatal termination, but differ in the fact that the primary growth is rarely multiple, and is usually found in somewhat older subjects. 11. Smooth globular tumours, hard to the touch and Exostosis, perfectly immovable, springing from the cranial bones, causing generally no pain, of small size, slow growth, and often multiple, are ivory exostoses. This growth may be distinguished from the " syphi- litic exostosis," or periosteal node that has undergone ossification, by the absence of any inflammatory sym- ptoms, by its slower progress, and by its uniform hard- ness throughout its whole course. 12.

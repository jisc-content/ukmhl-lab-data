AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK 151 Abscess. ness of the integuments, more or less sWHng, and, as suppuration takes place, and the pus approaches the surface, fluctuation will be evident. When of a cJiromc nature, as is usually the case when due to strumous adenitis, suppuration takes place very slowly, and the pus often widely undermining the skin and superjacent tissues is slow in pointing and coming to the surface. When the ahscess has hurst and discharged its con- tents, the cavity does not in many cases readily close, and, as a result, a sinus, or so-called " strumous ulcer," is left hehird (272). In cases where suppuration takes place at a consider- able distance from the surface beneath the deep fascia, giving rise to the formation of a " dee;p cervical abscess" the pus being bound down and unable to discharge itself externally, may burst into the trachea or cesophagus, or make its way into the pleural cavity or anterior medi- astinum, and a fatal result may ensue from one of these complications or from general blood poisoning. When thus affected, the side of the neck becomes hot, swollen, brawny and cedematous; the swelling, which is ill-defined, is tender on pressure, and pain is generally produced on any movement of the head; there may be but slight redness of the superjacent in- teguments, and owing to the pus being bound down by the deep fascia, fluctuation is often absent or very in- distinct, deglutition and respiration may be more or less interfered with owing to pressure upon the oesophagus and trachea, and severe constitutional disturbance is often present. 257.

AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK 163 „ , , Bronchoeele. For the diagnosis of this affection from carotid aneurism, with which it may be confounded, cf. (259). Acute bronchoeele is a rare affection in which the *• gland undergoing a rapid enlargement attains a consider- able size in the course of a few weeks. Malignant bronchoeele.—Carcinoma and sarcoma may 5. Malignant, attack the thyroid gland, but are of very rare oc- currence. 258. A circumscribed tumour in the course of one of Cervical Aneu- ,-, , . rism. the large arteries or at the root of the neck, more or less compressible, exhibiting pulsation of an excentric or ex- pansile character, with well-marked bruit perceptible when the ear is' placed over it, is probably an aneurism connected with the carotid, subclavian, or innominate arteries, or perhaps springing from the arch of the aorta. 259. An aneurism of the carotid artery is generally CarotidAneurism. situated near its bifurcation, the upper portion of the vessel being affected much more commonly than the lower one. Aneurism of the upper portion of the carotid artery usually presents itself as a small, well-defined ovoid tumour, with distinct, expansile pulsation and well- marked bruit; compression of the vessel below the tumour suspends both pulsation and bruit, and at the same time it becomes soft and diminished in size ; on withdrawing the pressure, the tumour refills in a certain number of beats. As it increases in size, from pressure upon the pharynx, oesophagus and larynx, deglutition and respiration become interfered with, and as a result of interference with the supply of blood to the head cerebral symptoms may be produced, e.g. giddiness, im- paired vision, noises in the ear, &c.

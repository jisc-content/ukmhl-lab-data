When of large size the swelling may be perceptible externally beneath the jaw, and fluctuation may then be obtained between the neck and the interior of the mouth. Sublingual Seba- 130. Encvsted TumouTs, oftcn congenital and of the ceous Cyst. . j. -j.! i â€¢ nature of sebaceous cysts, are sometimes met with, lymg upon the mylo-myoid muscle and situated more deeply in the floor of the mouth than the ranula or simple sublingual cyst (129). They project at the upper part of the neck beneath the jaw rather than on the floor of the mouth, often forming prominent tumours the size of an orange, and containing in their interior, not a thin glairy fluid, but cheesy sebaceous matter. Salivary Calculi. 131. Salivary CalcuU not uncommonly form in the ducts of the sublingual or submaxillary glands, giving rise to the presence of a hard swelling on the floor of the mouth, usually in the neighbourhood of the fraenum linguae. If the obstruction is complete, causing reten- tion of the salivary secretion, the corresponding gland will be more or less swollen and painful, and in excep- tional cases it may become the seat of suppuration and abscess.

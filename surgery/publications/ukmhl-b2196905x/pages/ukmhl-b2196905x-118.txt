Inlliitunia- tory. the tard palate is not unf requently present in children the suhjects of congenital syphilis. 152. The uvula is at times much thickened and in- creased in length, and under these circumstances is liahle to give rise to somewhat unpleasant symptoms, e. g. constant cough, and other symptoms of laryngeal irritation, tickling sensation in throat, feeling of nausea, &c. 153. Ulcemtion of the Palate, hard or soft, is very common as one of the symptoms of constitutional syphilis; it may be either of a superficial nature, or may extend deeply, causing perforation of the hard or considerable destruction of the soft. When the disease is arrested the ulcers heal, and adhesions often form between the velum and the back of the pharynx, causing more or less stenosis of the pharynx (180), and conse- quently interfering with deglutition and often producing a nasal intonation of voice. In other cases it is due to epithelioma, commencing in the velum palati or pillars of the fauces, or spreading from the tonsil (172) or tongue (135), and involving the palate secondarily from simple extension. 154. Perforation of the Sard Palate is generally the result of syphilitic ulceration of its mucous covering, which, extending deeply and involving the bone, has been followed by caries or necrosis of the bony palate ; the presence of this condition is usually indicated by a nasal intonation of voice. 155. A Swelling or undue Prominence on the Boof of the Mouth may be due to various conditions, viz. 1. Simple inflammatory affections, e. g. a simple abscess forming in the soft tissue covering the hard palate, as, for example, alveolar abscess, fori^iing in connection with the upper teeth and burrowing back-wards beneath

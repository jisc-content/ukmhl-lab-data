Tumours of Lower REGIONAL STTEGEET Jaw. 115. The tumours met with in connection with the lower jaw are very similar to those occurring in the superior maxilla (103). Sarcomata springing from the periosteum, or having their origin in the interior of the bone, are not uncom- mon, and are in many cases of an especially malignant nature. They are more or less elastic in their con- sistence, often containing cysts in their interior, and may rapidly attain a large size, involving the skin, bulging forwards the chin, pushing up the tongue, or growing downwards beneath the floor of the mouth. The various forms of e;pulis (162), dentigerous cysts (105), fihrous and fihro-cystic tumours, and more rarely osseous and encliondromatous growths, are also met with, all of which present characteristics very similar to those which are found in the case of similar growths affecting the upper jaw (106—108). Fibro-cystic Tumours.—The lower jaw is a favourite seat of the so-called "jfibro-cystic tumour," which may attain an immense size. It is, in some cases, the result of irritation set up by imperfectly-developed and mis- placed teeth, and consists of a number of cysts, whose walls are usually formed partly of bone and partly of fibrous tissue, and which contain a clearish fluid in their interior. The nature of the growth, which, unless it contains sarcomatous elements mingled with the fibrous tissue, is essentially of a simple character, is rendered evident on exploratory puncture, and in many cases a feeling of crackling, due to extreme thinning of the bone by absorption, can be obtained on pressure over the most prominent portion of the swelling.

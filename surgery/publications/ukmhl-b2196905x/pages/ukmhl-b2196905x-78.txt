68 REaiONAL SUEGEET springing, as a general rule, from the septum, to which they are attached by a broad base. They are usually of slow growth, firm consistence, and often cause consider- able displacement of the septum. Osteoma. 87. Osteomata, or osseous growths, are very rarely found in the interior of the nose, springing either from its bony walls or invading it from without. In some cases they are found lying quite loose in the nasal fossa, like the exostoses, which are occasionally found detached in the antrum (108) and frontal sinus ChronicDiscl,ar.e ^^^^' from the Nos- 88. A chronic discharge from the nostril may be due to several causes. If purulent, it is termed ozsena (78). If thin and mucoid, it is probably due to the pre- sence of a polypus (84), or some morbid condition of the mucous membrane lining the nasal fossa (cf. Coiyza, 77). If perfectly clear and watery, presenting the reaction of cerebro-spinal fluid, and following the receipt of an injury to the head, it shows that a fracture has taken place through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, through the fissure in which the cerebro-spinal fluid constantly drains away. Under these circumstances it will probably have been preceded by a history or sym- ptoms of fracture through the anterior fossa of the base of the skull (38). In rare cases a constant and copious discharge of a clear, colourless, watery fluid, free from smell, and con- taining little or no albumen, is met with from the nostrils, the interior of which is, on examination, found to present a perfectly normal condition. The fluid, which at times may be so abundant as to flow in an almost continuous stream, is probably secreted by the lining membrane of the antrum or frontal

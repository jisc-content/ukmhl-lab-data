AFFECTIONS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS 119 swallowed without much trouble, while considerable difficulty attends the passage of liqxiids (a condition just the opposite of that which exists in stricture), will serve to distinguish between the two affections ; the absence of any resistance to the passage of a bougie, the history of the case, and other symptoms present, will also assist in diagnosis. 191. Foreign Bodies are in some cases arrested in the Foreign oesophagus, and, if of considerable size, generally oppo- site the cricoid cartilage, or just above the diaphragm, these being the narrowest portions of the gullet; the symptoms indicating their presence are more or less irritation, with dysphagia and pain on swallowing. It not uncommonly happens that after some sharp or rough substance, such as a piece of bone, has been swallowed, the mucous lining of the oesophagus may have been slightly lacerated; under these circumstances the patient generally believes that the foreign body is still present in the cesophagus, and deglutition is, for a time, rendered painful and difficult. If of considerable size and impacted in the upper part of the gullet, a foreign body can sometimes be detected in the neck on external examination. 192. Scalds from swallowing boiling fluids, involving Scalds, the lower part of the pharynx and commencement of the oesophagus, are always followed by acute inflamma- tion of the parts, with pain and difficulty in deglutition; in many cases the orifice of the larynx is involved at the same time, as a result of which oedema glottidis (313) is produced, and death often results from suffo- cation. If the patient recovers from the effects of the injury, there is always a risk of a fibrous stricture of the CESophagus (188) forming in after life.

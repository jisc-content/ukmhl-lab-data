128 EEGIONAL SURGERY lid to he drawn upwards, witli inability to close tte eye is a condition very rarely met with as the result of some irritation, either central or reflex. p. Orbicularis. 3^ Paralysis of orbicularis, causing inability to close the eye, is due to paralysis of the seventh or facial nerve. This condition is generally present in cases of facial palsy, the causes and symptoms of which have been described (58). Owing to the relaxed condition of the lower lid, slight entropion (212) and epiphora (224) are often present. 4. Spasm of orhicularis, " JBlepharospasm" leading to contraction and closure of the eyelids, may be either of a tonic or clonic character. a. Tonic contraction of the orbicularis, causing the eyelids to be firmly closed, is found in all conditions of the eye where intolerance of light is a prominent sym- ptom, e. ff. corneal ulceration, granular and purulent ophthalmia, &c. 6. Clonic contraction of the orbicularis, or " nictita- tion," causing a frequent or almost constant bliaking of the eyelids, is sometimes seen in nervous subjects. The spasm may be confined to the eyelids or may affect the muscles of the whole of the side of the face (cf. 59).

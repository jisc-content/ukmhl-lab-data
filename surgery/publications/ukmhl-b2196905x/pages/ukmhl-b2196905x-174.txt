154 BEGIONAL SURGEET Carotid Anevrism. Diagnosis mours. Aneurism of tlie secondary carotids, more commonly tlie internal, is sometimes found ; while of the hranches of the external carotid, the temporal artery is the one most frequently involved, usually as the result of injury. Diagnosis—The principal affections with which a carotid aneurism is liable to be confounded are glandular or other tumours,abscess,andenlargementsof the thyroid gland. When situated at the root of the neck, it may be confounded with an innominate, subclavian, or aortic aneurism. For the chief points of diagnosis between these varieties, cf. (261). 1. Glandular or Glandular or other tumours may be distinguished by the solid, and, in many cases, irregular or nodulated character of the swelling; the nature of the pulsation, which, if transmitted, is a simple heaving up and down of the tumour and not of an expansile character ; the possibility of raising the tumour more or less completely from the subjacent artery, when the pulsation will cease; the absence of any diminution in the size of the swellmg on compression of the vessel below; and the fact that, upon the removal of pressure from the vessel below, the pulsation returns in the tumour at the fii'st renewed beat of the artery as strongly as ever, (and not only after a certain number of beats, as in the case of an aneurism), will usually assist in distinguishing a glandular or other tumour lying over the large blood-vessels from an aneurism affecting the upper part of the carotid artery. . ., Abscess —The presence of distinct fluctuation, its more rapid formation, the absence of expansile pulsation and of any diminution in the size of the swelling on compres- sion of the vessel below, a history or the presence of symptoms of inflammation, more or less marked, along 2. Abscess.

4 EEGIONAL SUEGEEY Conr/eiutal Tumours. â€” In exceptional cases, however, where the aperture to the skull is very small, or where it has become oblite- rated after birth, the symptoms just described as pecu- liar to these tumours of intracranial origin may be altogether absent. They may form in the line of any of the sutures, or at any of the fontanelles, but are most commonly situated in the middle line, often at the back of the head just behind the foramen magnum. Another favourite seat is at the root of the nose between the two halves of the frontal bone, or in the temporal fossa near its external angular process. Much more rarely a protrusion of the membranes of the brain may take place at the base of the skull, causing a swelling at the back and upper part of the pharynx. The same condition has been found at the point of junction of the frontal and ethmoidal bones, the meningocele under these circumstances presenting itself as a tumour on the roof of the nasal fossae. Sebaceous Cysts. 3. Small round or oval tumours, often somewhat flattened, and not uncommonly multiple, present at birth, slowly increasing in size, and rarely attaining a greater diameter than about two thirds of an inch, are congenital sebaceous, dermoid, or cutaneous cysts. These tumours have often deep attachments, being connected with the pericranium, in some cases perforating one or both tables of the skull, and not unfrequently lying in contact with the dura mater. Sometimes they contain hair in their interior. Small meningoceles or encepha- loceles are very liable to be mistaken for these tumours, but they may be distinguished by the fact that a seba- ceous cyst is not reducible, never pulsates, does not in- crease in size on violent expiratory movements, and is often found in situations where a meningocele could not exist. If pressure upon the tumour causes cerebral

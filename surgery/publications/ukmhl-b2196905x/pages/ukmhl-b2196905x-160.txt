Compression of the ophthalmic vein.—In some cases in which all the symptoms of orbital aneurism have been present during life, nothing has been found after death beyond compression of the ophthalmic vein as it lea,ves the cavity of the orbit by an aneurism of the internal carotid artery, or by a thrombus in the cavernous sinus. 242. Venous Ncevi, generally of congenital origin, are often met with in the neighbourhood of the orbit; they may be situated deeply in its interior, or superficially near its margin, and in the latter case they often extend to and implicate the eyelids (205). If superficial, a nsevus usually presents itself as a softish, ill-defined, elastic swelling, of a somewhat bluish colour, devoid of pulsation, compressible, and becoming harder and more tense during violent expiratory efforts. If situated deeply the diagnosis will be more difficult, protrusion of the eyeball, increased on forced expiration, being the most prominent symptom. 243. Malignant Growths, of a sarcomatous or cancerous nature, springing from the bones, periosteum, or soft tissues, are sometimes found in the interior of the orbit; they are characterised by their rapid growth, ill-defined outline, and speedy implication both of the eyeball itself and adjacent parts. 244. The Tumours or Swellings originating at some point external to the orbit and secondarily involving tlmt cavity include— 1. Affections of the upper jaw and antrum, e. g. tu- mours of the janr and antrum (103), hydrops antri (104), suppuration of the antrum (110), &c. 2. Affections of the frontal sinus (61).

152 Bronchocele. REGIONAI, SUEGEET 2. Cystic. S. Pulsating. hypertrophy of the thyroid gland, which may attain a considerable size, so as to form a prominent swelling in the fore part of the neck. Both lobes are generally in- volved in this general enlargement, which is most com- monly met with in young females, and is often associated with some menstrual irregularity. In its severer forms this affection is endemic, in this country prevailing especially in Derbyshire, hence it is sometimes termed " Derbyshire necK" In rare instances, a simple bronchocele may undergo calcareous degenera- tion, and inflammatory changes may subsequently be excited, leading to the formation of an abscess. The shape of the swelling and its situation corre- sponding with that of the gland or one of its lobes, its slow growth, its very frequent occurrence in females, and its movement with the larynx during degluti- tion, will usually assist in the diagnosis of this affec- tion. Cystic hronchocele.â€”In this form of enlargement, the hypertrophy of the gland is accompanied by the forma- tion of cystic cavities in its interior, containing a viscid or thin and watery fluid; the cysts may be multiple and of small size, or few in number and under these circum- stances of large dimensions. Pulsating Bronchocele, Uasophthalmic Goitre; Graves* or Basedow's disease, are terms applied to a pulsating enlargement of the thyroid body, in which the hyper- trophy of the gland, not usually very great, is accom- panied by dilatation of its blood-vessels. The gland, which is enlarged and somewhat softish, pulsates synchronously with the carotid artery; it is generally associated with palpitation of the heart, marked pulsation in the vessels of the neck, and prominence of the eyeballs, or " exophthalmos."

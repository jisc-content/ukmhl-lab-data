Hordeolum, or Stye, is the term applied to an acute or subacute inflammation of the glands at the margin of the eyelids. It shows itself as a small, red, and painful swelling, which may suppurate, or remain in an indolent condition for some time, and then gradually subside. Styes are in many cases, especially when appearing in successive crops, indicative of a lew state of the general health. 198. Inflammation of the soft tissues entering into the formation of the eyelids may occur as the result of injury, or it may be due to simple extension of inflam- mation from adjacent parts, e. g. the face, scalp, or orbit itself; the eyelids become red, hot, painful, and exces- sively swollen, and, if suppuration occurs, fluctuation will be evident. 199. Ulceration of the eyelids may be due to various causes, viz.: The cutaneous aspect of the eye- lids, more especially the lower one, is a favourite seat of rodent ulcer; they may also become the seat of epithelioma or lupus (the general characteristics of which have been described in Table, p. 34) or of sy- philitic ulcers (200). 200. Syphilis may attack the eyelids in the form of primary sores or chancres, or secondary or tertiary ulcers. Chancres are of extremely rare occurrence. They usually appear as superficial or slightly excavated sores, with well-marked induration about their base; there is 1. Rodent ulcer 2. Lupus 3. Epithelioma 4s. Syphilitic

Lateral curvature may also be produced when collapse of the walls of the thorax has taken place in cases of pleurisy or empyema. It is often present in cases of shortening of either lower extremity from any cause, e. g. morbus coxae, &c., the obliquity of the pelvis causing a lumbar curve, and this is compensated for by a dorsal curve in the oppo- site direction, which may involve the lower cervical vertebrae. Rigidity of Spine. 310. Rigidity OX Stiffness of the cervical spine, causing the patient to hold the neck more or less completely fixed and interfering with the movements of the head, may follow an injury to the back of the neck (301), or it may be due to anchylosis of the hodies of the vertebrce, e.g. in caries of the spine (304), spondylitis deformans (305), or simple muscular contraction, e.g. in torticollis (265); in the very early stage of caries of the cervical spine, before anchylosis has taken place, stiffness of the neck, due to simple contraction of the muscles from reflex irritation, is always a prominent symptom (304). It is also present in some cases of osteitis deformans (308), the result either of simple contraction of the ligaments, or of changes in the vertebrae themselves. Spina Bifida. 311. Spina Bifida is the term applied to a congenital hernia, or protrusion, of the membranes of the cord through a cleft in the arches of the vertebrae, owing to their incomplete closure. Though this condition is more common in the lower dorsal or lumbar region, it is occasionally met with in the cervical portion of the spinal column. The sac of the tumour, which is formed by the skin

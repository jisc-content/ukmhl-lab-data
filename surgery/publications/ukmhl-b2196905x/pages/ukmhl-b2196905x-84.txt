EEGIONAL STTEQEET Chancre. o. Hard or In- 98. a. Sard Chancres, or primary syptilitic sores, fectmg. sometimes met with on the lips, usually the lower one, as the result of the direct inoculation of some accidental crack or fissure with the syphilitic virus. In some cases, it shows itself as a fissure with indu- rated margins and base; in other cases, the whole thick- ness of the lip may be affected, being converted into a mass of indurated tissue with an ulcerated surface, which is usually somewhat smooth, and discha,rges a scanty secretion. In many cases, the lip is protruded and somewhat everted, so that the patient is unable to completely close the mouth. The diagnosis of the affection, which is sometimes mistaken for epithelioma (99), can usually be made by attention to the following points:—In chancre, the affection is usually found at an earlier period of life, and most commonly in the female sex. The surface of the sore is generally flattened, and much less warty and irregular than is the case in epithelioma. The cutaneous border of the lip is oftener involved than the mucous surface, as in epithelioma. The indiu-ation at its base, if present, is not so marked and much more limited in extent. The submaxillary glands are usually affected at the time the case comes under observation, being involved at a much earlier stage of the disease (usually within three weeks) than is the case in epithelioma. If the case has been in progress for some weeks, secondary symptoms, e. g. rash and soi'e throat, will have usually made their appearance. Under specific treatment the sore will generally rapidly heal. t. Snft or Non- &• Much moro rarely, as the result generally of auto- infecting, inoculation, from careless habits, want of cleanliness, &c., the lips are affected with the sqfl or non-infecting chancre. In this variety, the ulceration, which is of an

AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX AND TEACHEA 187 mucous memlDraiie lining its interior may then become tlie seat of the deposit characteristic of this affection. It may he distinguished from the other forms of laryn- gitis by the fact that diphtheria is either epidemic or there is a history of contagion ; the general symptoms of diphtheria will have preceded the implication of the larynx, and on examination of the throat the peculiar deposit will probably be evident; enlargement of the glands about the angles of the jaw will almost invari- ably be present; epiataxis will probably occur from time to time ; and, on examination of the urine, it will generally be found to contain albumen. As one of the sequelae of diphtheria, paralysis of the muscles of the larynx is sometimes seen. 317. Chronic Inflammation of the Interior of the Larynx may depend upon constitutional causes, e.g. phthisis, syphilis; or, it may remain as the sequel of the acute form of inflammation; it may result from excessive use of the voice, or may be produced in con- sequence of some cause of irritation extending from the throat or acting upon the larynx itself, e.g. inhalation of irritant matter, excessive smoking, ulceration, or growths in the larynx, &c. The appearances produced in the larynx vary in different cases, but, as a general rule, its mucous lining is more or less congested, hypersemic, and thickened; in some cases its surface is dry and shining, or it may be swollen and cedematous, discharging an abundant secretion. In glandular or follicular laryngitis, which usually accompanies "clergyman's sore throat" (176), the mucous glands of the larynx, which are the structures chiefly involved, become enlarged and prominent. In phthisical larynyitis there is, in many cases, a de- posit of tubercle beneath the mucous membrane cover-

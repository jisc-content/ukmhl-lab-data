INJURIES AND AFFECTIONS OF CERVICAL SPINE 179 _ , , Curvature of ( vical Spine. dorsal and lumbar regions), with considerable rigidity, — is sometimes seen. This condition appears to be due to contraction and hardening of the fibrous and ligamentous structures of the spine, the vertebrae themselves generally remaining healthy and separate from one another; in some cases, however, they have been found much hypertrophied, undergoing changes identical with those seen in the bones of the cranium and extremities (cf. 33 b). 309. 3. In lateral curvature, due to relaxation and 3. Lateral, weakening of the muscles and ligaments of the spine, ■the lower cervical vertebrae are generally involved in the upper or dorsal curve, the convexity of which usually looks towards the right shoulder; or, in ex- treme cases, a third, independent or compensatory curve is sometimes produced in the cervical portion of the spine. This form of curvature is usually met with between the ages of 12 and 18 years, much more com- monly in girls than boys. The displacement is not a purely lateral one, for the bodies of the vertebrae are in addition somewhat rotated or twisted upon each other in such a way that, while the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae look towards the convexity of the curve, the spinous processes occupy the concavity; on this account the deformity is sometimes called " rotation curvature." When the deformity has lasted for some time, the bodies of the vertebrae will often be found somewhat compressed on the concave side of the curve. In rare cases of caries affecting chiefly one side of the bodies of the vertebrae, a lateral displacement may be produced instead of the ordinary angular curvature backwards, but under these conditions a certain amount of displacement backwards is always present as well.

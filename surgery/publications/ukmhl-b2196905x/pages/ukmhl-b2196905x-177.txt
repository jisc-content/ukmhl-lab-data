Arterio-venous Aneurism is the term applied to ^'^^Ane'urism"^ an abnormal communication between an artery and a vein, the result either of injury or disease. It comprises two different conditions, viz. : Aneiirismal varix—when the artery and vein directly communicate. Varicose aneurism—when the artery and vein do not directly communicate, but an aneurismal sac is formed between the two, into which the blood passes after leaving the artery, and before entering the vein. Aneurismal varix of carotid artery and jugular vein Aneurismal may occur as the result of wounds in the neck involving these vessels; it shows itself as a soft, oblong, some- what irregular, compressible tumour, and if situated near the surface, the skin covering it will be of a bluish colour; it exhibits pulsation, but not of the distinct expansive character peculiar to a true aneurism; on auscultation a loud rasping bruit can be heard; if the carotid artery is compressed below, the pulsation will cease, and the tumour can be partially emptied of blood.

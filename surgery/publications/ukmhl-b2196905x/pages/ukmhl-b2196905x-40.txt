Leontiasis 03sea. gradually increases in size, owing to thickening of the bones entering into its formation. The bones of the face generally remain unaffected, retaining their normal condition. At the same time the normal curvatures of the vertebral column gradually become much exagge- rated, so that the patient's stature is considerably diminished, while the spine itseK becomes stiff and rigid (308 c). The long bones of both upper and lower extremities enlarge and soften, becoming in many instances un- usually curved and misshapen. This affection, which appears to be of a chronic in- flammatory nature, is very rarely met with before middle life. It runs a very slow course, usually lasting for many years. A curious feature in connection with it is that malig- nant disease (especially cancer or sarcoma attacking some portion of the skeleton) eventually shows itself in a large proportion of the subjects of this affection. This condition differs from leontiasis ossea in two important points:â€”1st, in the more advanced age of the patients ; 2nd, in the fact that the facial bones are not involved. In Leontiasis ossea* a very rare affection, which is generally met with in early life, sometimes in young children, the bones of the cranium and, in addition, those of the face (and in some cases those of the ex- tremities also),becoming greatly thickened and enlarged (108). In consequence of these changes, the cavity of the cranium is greatly contracted, and when the bones of the face are involved (in which respect it differs from ostitis deformans) the orbits, antrum, frontal sinuses,

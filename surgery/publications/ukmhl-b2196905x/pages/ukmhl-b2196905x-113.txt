AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE 93 Syplnlitic due to ''desquamative sypliUs of tie tongue" a condition recently described as occurring in young children tlie subjects of congenital syphilis* 138. Primary sores, the result of direct inoculation with the syphiUtic virus, are occasionally, though very rarely, seen attacking the tongue. The sore presents the characteristic appearance of the Hunterian chancre, though somewhat modified by its unusual situation, and is soon followed by enlargement and induration of the glands beneath the jaw. 139. Mucous tubercles are generally an early second- ary symptom, occurring at the same time as the papular eruption on the skin. They show themselves as broad, flattened, slightly-raised patches, of a pale- white colour, situated on the margins or surface of the tongue, and resembling in their general appearance the mucous tubercles so often seen on other parts. In many cases ulceration or erosion of their surfaces occurs, giving rise to the " superficial syphilitic ulcer" (135,3). 140. The appearances presented by these affections, which are often found in patients suffering from con- stitutional syphilis, have been already described. Cf. Chronic Superficial Grlossitis (132), Psoriasis (133), Ichthyosis linguae (134). 141. Gummatous deposits may form in the substance of the tongue, in some cases near or upon the margins, but more commonly on the dorsum, in the neighbour- hood of the fibrous septum, and towards its middle or posterior part. They usually appear as small, nodular, painless tumours, single or multiple, varying in size from a pea to a filbert (though in some cases they may attain larger dimensions), projecting on the surface and * Parrot, 'Med.

REGIONAL StJEGEET Cervical Caries. felt over tlie shoulders, along the arms, or in front of the upper part of the chest, following the distribution of the cervical nerves and brachial plexus. In order to ease the pain, some device is often pre- sent for relieving the spine of the weight of the head, e. (/. the patient often supports the chin or occiput with the hands, or rests the head upon a chair. In the later stages, when the disease is more ad- vanced, some of the following symptoms may be pre- sent, viz. : 3. Angular curvature (Pott's curvature) or undue prominence of the spines of the affected vertebrae, as the result of destruction and fusion together of the bodies of the diseased vertebrae. 4. Thickening of the soft tissues over the affected vertebrae. 5. Slight increase of temperature over the affected por- tion of the spine. 6. Abscess, which may present behind the pharynx (post-pharyngeal, 182) or pass forwards heneath the sterno-mastoid to the side or front of the neck (256) ; when the abscess discharges its contents, portions of necrosed bone may come away, exfoliating into the pharynx and being coughed up by the patient, or escap- ing through a sinus in the neck. 7. Sinuses about the neck, in some cases leading down to diseased bone, only present in the later stages after suppuration has occurred. 8. Paralysis: though in the majority of cases the spinal cord usually escapes, yet in some instances jjara- lysis, more or less complete, may be produced as the result of pressure upon the cord by the displaced ver- tebrae, or in consequence of inflammatory changes set tip in its membranes (pachymeningitis).

Otitis Externa Circumscripta is Silocalised inflam- °^^^j*^'^^^*//?p*,a_ mation of the soft tissues lining the external meatus, Abscess or Fur- which in many cases leads to the formation of a small abscess or boil (furunculus). The symptoms are very similar to those attending the diffuse form of otitis externa (342), differing only in the fact that the inflammation is confined to a limited portion of the external auditory canal; in many cases a succession of small abscesses takes place, another form- ing as soon as the preceding one has healed up. 344. Ulceration of the External Meatus may remain Ulceration, as the result of otitis externa (342), or it may be due to syphilis or caries of the meatus; or be associated with perforation of the membrana tympani. It is characterised by a more or less purulent dis- charge from the ear, and on examination of the parts the ulcerated surface will usually be evident. 345. Caries of the Walls of the External Meatus may Caries, be produced as the result of otitis externa (342), where the periosteum has become affected, or it may follow inflammation and disease of the middle ear. It is characterised by the presence of a purulent dis- charge, and on examination with a probe, rough and carious bone will be detected. 346. The tumours or new growths most commonly Tumours, found in the external meatus are exostoses (347), polypi (349), and sebaceous tumours (348). 347. Exostoses, or small bony outgrowths, are not Exostoses, unfrequently met with in the external meatus, spring. ing from any part of its osseous walls; they are covered by the cutaneous tissues of the canal and are usually unattended by any pain; when of considerable size

AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS 71 tially of a malignant nature, as in many cases life is eventually destroyed from mechanical interference with deglutition, pressure upon tlie brain, or some other com- plication. 110. Suppuration may occur in the interior of the ^n- antrum as the result of some local injury, or in conse- quence of irritation set up by the fang of a carious tooth (bicuspid or molar) ; in other cases it may be associated with necrosis of its walls, or be due to the irritation caused by retained secretion. The symptoms are very similar to those of dropsy of the antrum (104), but are distinguished from that affection by being accompanied by evident signs of inflammatory action, viz. local heat and tenderness with throbbing pain. Any of the walls of the cavity may be expanded, and when the distension is extreme, egg-shell crackling on pressure is often present; or the pus, as it forms, may drain away through the socket of a tooth into the mouth, or discharge into the nose through the commu- nication with the middle fossa. In other perfo- rating the anterior wall of the antrum, it may burst externally through the cheek, or, opening beneath the cheek, may discharge between it and the gum into the mouth, 111. Abscess about the gums is very common as the Alveolar Abscess ... ^ â€¢ ^ Gum-boil. result of irritation set up by carious teeth; as suppura- tion takes place around the fang of the tooth, the bony walls of the alveolus become gradually expanded and absorbed, and the pus, as soon as it has formed, tends to make its way externally, either discharging at the free margin of the gum round the neck of the tooth, or perforating the gum at a point corresponding to the fang of the tooth involved. In other cases, the pus burrowing for some distance between the bone and

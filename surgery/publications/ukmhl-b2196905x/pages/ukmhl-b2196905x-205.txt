AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA 185 feet aeration of the blood appear, and death ensues, either suddenly from spasm of the glottis or from gra- dually increasing obstruction to respiration, the result of oedematous infiltration of the submucous tissue lining the interior of the larynx (oedema glottidis). "fj^Xdis" On examination with the laryngoscope, the laryngeal mucous membrane will, in the early stage, be seen to be turgid and of a bright red colour, and when oedema glottidis is present, the epiglottis and ar> teno-epiglot- tidean folds will be found much swollen and congested, so as to prevent inspection of the interior of the larynx. 314. Croup, or Gynanche Trachealis, is an acute in- C'SwIiT'^" flammation of the larynx peculiar to childhood, charac- terised by the deposit of a peculiar exudation or false membrane on the mucous membrane lining its interior, and which in many cases also extends to and involves the trachea. This affection usually sets in during the night, in many cases suddenly and without any premonitory symptoms; the voice is hoarse, or completely lost; paroxysms of hard, dry, ringing cough come on from time to time, and the cough is interrupted by a shrill, whistling, or crowing inspiration. A little viscid mucus is sometimes brought up, and the expectoration may oocasionally consist of shreds or patches of the false membrane. Eespiration is greatly interfered with, being very laboured and attended by violent efforts ; more or less pyrexia is generally present. The symptoms are not persistent, being worse at night, when the paroxysms are always aggravated. In fatal cases the dyspnoea in- creases, the respiration becomes still more laboured, and is attended by suclring-in of the chest walls; the pulse becomes small and thready and the face livid;

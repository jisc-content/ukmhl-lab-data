AFFECTIONS OF THE PHARYNX ]11 „ ,t,- Syphilitic Pha- ryngitis. whitisli colour, circular or oval in shape, and often bilaterally symmetrical. In many cases they become the seat of shallow ulcer- ations, as a result of which numerous small ulcers with sharply-cut edges, never sinking to any great depth, are seen studded over the pillars of the fauces, velum palati, and surface of the tonsils. 3. Ulceration.—In the later stages of the affection, ^- Ulceration, deep and perforating ulcers, due to breaking down of gummatous deposits, form in the same parts, destroying the soft palate and pillars of the fauces more or less completely (153), extending deeply into the substance of the tonsils (171), and sometimes affecting also the posterior surface of the pharynx (179). 178. In Diphtheria, the mucous lining of the pharynx, ^ipi»ti»eria. much inflamed and swollen, becomes coated in places with a thick, greyish-white exudation. When this sepa- rates and comes away, it leaves behind a raw, bleeding surface or distinct ulcer, which, however, soon becomes covered over again with a fresh deposit, and this spread- ing from the throat may involve the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. There is considerable depression of strength, quick pulse, more or less pyrexia, albuminous urine, soreness of the throat, dijfficulty in swallowing, dyspnoea if the larynx becomes involved, and tenderness and enlaro-e- ment of the lymphatic glands about the angles of the jaw. 179. TJlcera:tion of the interior of the pharynx is Ulceration. generally the result of constitutional syphilis (177), and !• SyphiiiUc. in the majority of cases the soft palate (153) and tonsils (171) will be found to be more or less similarly affected. In other cases it may be due to epithelioma com- EpiHieiio- lUlltOUS.

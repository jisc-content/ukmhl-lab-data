134 REGIONAL SUEGEEY 12. Chronic hydroceplialus (34). Symptoms.—The degree of protrusion and direction in which the displacement takes place will depend upon the extent and nature of the disease; thus the globe may be displaced directly forwards, or in a lateral, or upward or downward direction. Double vision (diplo- pia) is often present; if the protrusion is so great that the eyeball is left uncovered by the eyelids, ulcera- tion and sloughing of the cornea may result, and, owing to displacement of the puncta, epiphora (224) is often produced. Orbital Ceiivuitis. 230. Orlital Cellulitis, or inflammation of the con- nective tissue of the orbit, may be produced as the • result of injury, e. g. blows on the eye, penetrating wounds, fractures involving the walls of the orbit, the presence of a foreign body &c.; or it may be excited, independently of any injury, as the result of extension of inflammation from any of the parts in the neighbour- hood of the orbit, e. g. erysipelas of the face or scalp. The inflammation may be either of an acute or a chronic character, and in many cases goes on to suppu- ration and the formation of an abscess. Deep-seated pain will be present, more or less acute, according to the severity of the symptoms. The eye- lids become red and swollen, with chemosis of the con- junctiva ; vision is affected, and there is protrusion of the eyeball, with limitation of its movements. Abscess. When suppuration occurs, the symptoms become more marked, and as the pus makes its way to the sur- face, fluctuation will be detected at the most prominent part of the swelling. When the abscess is of a chronic nature, suppuration taking place very slowly and without being attended by any pain, the condition may simulate very closely that

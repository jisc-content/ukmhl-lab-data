212 EEGIONAIi STTEGEEY Complications of Suppuration in -. . the Middle Ear. cranial cavity on the other, serious comi^lications may occur in cases of suppuration in the middle ear, viz. : 1. Caries of the thin septum of. bone which forms the roof of the tympanum and separates it from the cranial cavity may at any time occur, and, as a con- sequence, meningitis, or cerebral abscess, may be pro- duced. 2. The same effects may be produced as the result of extension of disease to the internal ear, and thence through the internal auditory canal to the interior of the cranial cavity. 3. Suppuration in the mastoid cells, and caries or necrosis of their walls (311) is very liable to be pro- duced as the result of extension of inflammation from the tympanum into their interior; and owing to the fact that the mastoid veins open directly into the lateral sinus, absorption of inflammatory products is very likely to take place, and as a consequence s&ptiecemia or pyaemia may be produced. 4. Pohjpi (360) often appear when the purulent dis- charge has continued for some time, and by blocking up the external meatus, and in this way obstructing the free discharge of pus from the middle ear, they may indirectly assist in producing any of the above complications. Polypi. 360. Aural Polypi almost invariably spring from the mucous membrane lining the middle ear, and they are generally found in cases where a purulent discharge has been in existence for some time, growing outwards through a perforation in the membrana tympani, which is usually found to be present. The growth may be of small size, just showing itself through the opening in the membrane, or it may appear

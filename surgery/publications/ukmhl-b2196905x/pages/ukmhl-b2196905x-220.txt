Foreign bodies axe often passed into the external meatus, especially in the case of young children. If rough and angular, or tiglitly wedged in the canal, or pressing on the membrana tympani, their presence generally gives rise to more or less pain and loss of hearing, though unless the meatus is completely ob- structed, deafness is not generally present; if allowed to remain severe inflammation may be excited, especi- ally if the substance is rough or sharp; under these circumstances considerable swelling of the soft tissues lining the meatus will be produced, accompanied by a purulent discharge, and perforation of the membrana tympani often results. On examination with a specu- lum, the foreign body can generally be detected, obstruct- ing from view the drum-head. 342. Diffuse Inflammation of the External Meatus may involve only the cutaneous tissues, or it may ex- tend more deeply, implicating the periosteum of the osseous portion of the canal; it may also affect the membrana tympani itself. This condition is most frequently met with in children after scarlet fever or one of the exanthemata, or it may arise idiopathi- cally as the result of exposure to cold, or simply in connection with a low state of health; in other cases it may be excited by the presence of a foreign body (341). It commences with a feeling of heat and uneasiness within the external meatus, the orifice of which soon becomes red, tender, and swollen; deafness and tin- nitus are generally present; sooner or later a purulent discharge appears, and the pain, which has usually been a prominent symptom, then disappears. In some cases

AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE 59 sinus, and is sometimes associated with the presence of a polypus, or with some morbid condition of the mucous membrane lining the interior of these cavities* (106, 61). 88 a. "Adenoid Vegetations in the Naso-pharyngeal Cavity" t is the term applied to little growths or vegeta- tions, which, though they may spring from any part of the mucous lining of the naso-pharynx with the excep- tion of the septum nasi, are most commonly found situated on its upper and posterior walls. The growths, which are often vascular and bleed readily on slight irritation, vary in size and shape, appearing either cristate, cylindrical, or flat and sessile. They appear to be due to simple hypertrophy of the glandular or adenoid tissue in this situation, and the condition is generally found associated with thickening and hypertrophy of the surrounding mucous membrane. If few in number and of small size, they may give rise to no symptoms whatever ; if exuberant and plenti- ful, blocking up more or less completely the nasal fossse, considerable impediment will be offered to respiration. The voice is altered, becoming thick and losing its resonance in the naso-pharynx. Hearing is often affected, owing to the Eustachian tubes being more or less obstructed by the presence of the growths about their orifices. In severe cases, owing to the fact that the patient is compelled to constantly breathe through the mouth, the nose after a time somewhat collapses, becoming thin and compressed. On digital examination of the naso-pharynx from the mouth the vegetations can often be felt as softish * Paget, ' Clinical Society's Transactions,' 1879.

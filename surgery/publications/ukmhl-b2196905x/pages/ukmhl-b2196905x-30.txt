Probably many of the growths formerly described under this name are sarcomatous tumours, springing from the diploe of the bone, or which, originating either from the dura mater or pericranium, penetrate the skull either from within or without, and subsequently present themselves externally as more or less fungat- ing tumours. 14. A soft, fluctuating, more or less rapidly forming swelling, preceded by symptoms of inflammation, which will vary in intensity according as the process is of an acute or chronic character, is probably an abscess. If superficial to the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, the suppuration is usually limited in extent, forming a well-defined swelling; but if beneath, it may (as in the case of extravasation of blood) spread widely in the loose areolar tissue between the aponeurosis of the muscle and the pericranium. In many cases an abscess of the scalp is due to some cause of local irritation, e.g. pediculi, or it may form as the result of injury, or without any apparent cause; when occurring in syphilitic subjects, it is often due to the softening and breaking down of a gummatous de- posit (8, 9 a.) When situated behind the ear, an abscess may be due to suppuration of a lymphatic gland (17), or to disease of the mastoid process (361). When at the back of the scalp, it may be connected with the oc- cipital lymphatic glands (17). 16. Epithelioma may attack the scalp in the form of a foul ulcer with a hardened base, raised and irregular surface, and prominent, everted and indurated edges. After a time the neighbouring lymphatic glands become enlarged and nodular, and the surrounding parts be-

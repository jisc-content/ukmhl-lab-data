REGIONAL SURGERY 126 212. Entropion, or inversion of tlie margin of the eyelids, may be of two kinds, viz. : 1. Spasmodic—the result of spasmodic contraction of the orbicularis muscle; this form is most commonly seen in old people, in whom the skin of the eyelids is loose and relaxed. 2. Organic—dependent upon structural changes lead- ing to contraction of the palpebral conjunctiva; this is generally the result of granular or purulent ophthalmia, or of injuries or operations involving the eyelids, in which a portion of the palpebral conjunctiva has been destroyed. Trichiasis (214) is generally produced, and in many cases epiphora (224), due to displacement or obstruc- tion of the canaliculi, is also present. 213. Ectropion, or eversion of the margin of the eye- lid, is the opposite condition to the preceding, and may be due to a variety of different causes; e. g. the con- traction of cicatrices on the face or eyelids in the case of wounds, burns, lupoid or other forms of ulceration, involving the soft tissues in the neighbourhood of the orbit; dropping of the lower lid with slight eversion of its margin is sometimes seen in cases of paralysis of the orbicularis, or, in the old and feeble, where the skin of the eyelid is loose and relaxed. In consequence of the eversion of the eyelid, which varies in extent in different cases, the exposed con- junctiva becomes thickened and inflamed; owing to the displacement of the canaliculi, epiphora is present, and in severe cases, owing to the anterior surface of the eyeball being constantly exposed and deprived of its natural coverings, chronic inflammatory changes, often leading to ulceration, are produced. 214. Ti-ichiasis is the term applied to an ingrowing

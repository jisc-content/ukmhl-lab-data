AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE jp^tign, of Frontal Sinvset. nose becomes closed; or it may depend upon some morbid condition of the sinus itself, e.g. tlie presence of polypi, hydatids, cystic or other forms of tumours. It may be either of an acute or a chronic character. When acute the distension is generally due to the presence of pus, which, accumulating in its interior and perforating its bony walls, may discharge itself either externally at the inner margin of the orbit, or internally into the nose. This condition is attended by consider- able pain of an acute or dull aching character, along with redness, tenderness, and swelling of the eyelids and soft tissues about the inner canthus. When chronic the distension is, as a rule, simply due to the accumulation of secretion, which may remain pent up for a considerable period without giving rise to any symptoms except the presence of a swelling at the inner and upper margin of the orbit, which causes a gradual displacement of the eyeball. This condition is liable to be mistaken for distension of the lachrymal sac (222). The frontal sinuses are occasionally the seat of ivory j. Exostoses. exostoses, which, in some cases having very narrow attachments, are liable to undergo spontaneous fracture at their base, and thus they may be found lying loose in the interior of the air-cells in this situation. To this variety of bony tumour the term " enostosis " is some- times applied. Similar growths are sometimes found in the interior of the antrum (108) and nasal fossae (87). The frontal sinuses are sometimes the seat of polypi, c. Polypi, which, as above described, may give rise to " disten- sion." In other cases they may cause a clear discharge from the nostril (83). Fractures involving the frontal sinus may be gene- rf. Fracture.

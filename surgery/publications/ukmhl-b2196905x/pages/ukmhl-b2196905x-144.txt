124 EEGIONAL STJUGERY Meibomian or Tarsal Cysts. Nsevi. Papillomata. Sebaceous Cysts. or dermoid cysts (207), molluscum contagiosum (208); they also frequently become the seat of rodent ulcer (199), and much more rarely of epithelioma (199). 204. Small, isolated, encysted tumours, due to hyper- trophy or overgrowth of a Meibomian gland, are often met with in the eyelids, more especially the upper one. They usually appear as small, hard, painless nodules, about the size of a pea ; more than one is often present, and they may make their way, either inwards so as to project on the conjunctival surface, or less frequently outwards beneath the skin, which is at first freely mov- able over them ; they may remain of small size and in a stationary condition for a considerable period, or, be- coming inflamed, may sometimes suppurate. 206. The eyelids are sometimes the seat of ncevi, which may be confined to the skin, or involve the whole thickness of the lid and subjacent conjunctiva; in some cases, they may be an extension of similar growths within the orbit (242). 206. Papillomata, or warty growths, are sometimes met with attacking the margins of the eyelids. When occurring in elderly people, they should be regarded with suspicion, for, as previously stated (199), the eye- lids are a favourite situation for rodent ulcer, which in many instances first shows itself in the form of a small nodule or warty growth. 207. Sebaceous or Dermoid cysts are sometimes met with in the neighbourhood of the eyelids, most com- monly at the upper and outer, or lower and inner, margins of the orbit. They are usually of congenital origin, lying at some depth from the surface beneath the orbicularis muscle, often in a depression in the subjacent bone, which in some cases may be completely perforated.

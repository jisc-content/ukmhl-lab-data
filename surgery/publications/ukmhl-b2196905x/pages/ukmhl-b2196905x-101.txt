AFFECTIONS OF THE TEETH 81 the same time they are usually somewhat dwarfed or di- minished in size, and their direction is altered, so that they often converge towards or diverge from each other. The other incisors are usually similarly deformed, though to a much less extent, as also the canines, which are often somewhat peg-shaped, and may present a notch on their cutting border ; in many cases they are separated from one another by wide gaps. At the same time, owing to deficiency of enamel, the teeth are soft and of a bad colour, readily wearing away; on this account the characteristic malformation disappears after many years of wear, being, as a rule, only to be recognised between the ages of eight and twenty-five or thirty years. In some cases the cutting edge, which is usually much thinned, presents a number of small spines bounded above by a crescentic line (" serrated teeth "), or two notches with a central projection (" peg-top teeth ") ; these two conditions are usually an early stage in the formation of that above described, for, after a time, the little spines or projections will wear away or break off, leaving as the result a single crescentic notch on the cutting border of the tooth. These malformations of the teeth (which it must be borne in mind are not necessarily present in the subjects of congenital syphilis) are the indirect result of stoma- titis (127) during infancy, which, involving the perios- teum of the gums and lining membrane of the dental follicles, interferes with the nutrition and development of the tooth just at the period when dentification is taking place. 124.

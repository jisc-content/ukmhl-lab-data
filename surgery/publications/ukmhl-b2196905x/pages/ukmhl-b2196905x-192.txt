CHAPTER XXI INJURIES AND AFFECTIONS OP CEEVICAL SPINE Injuries. 300. The injuries to which the cervical portion of the spinal column is subject are sprains or twists, disloca- tions, and fracture. Sprains. 301. Severe strain or stretching, and even laceration, of the ligaments connecting together the cervical ver- tebrae is followed by pain and aching in the back of the neck, more or less swelling over the affected part, along with stiffness and inability to move the head from side to side, or to and fro. Dislocation. 302. Pure dislocation of the spine can for anatomical reasons (e.g. the greater mobility of the cervical vertebrae and the horizontal aspect of their articular processes) only occur in the cervical region, such an injury being almost impossible in the dorsal and lumbar portions of the column. The upper vertebrae are generally thrown forwards upon the lower, the spinal cord being more or less pressed upon and crushed between them. The lower cervical vertebrae, third to seventh, are those which are most usually displaced, the fifth most com- monly, and in the majority of cases the dislocation is associated with fracture. Dislocation of the atlas from the occipital bone has been known to occur, but is very rare. Dislocation of the axis from the atlas is of more fre- quent occurrence, and it may happen with or without

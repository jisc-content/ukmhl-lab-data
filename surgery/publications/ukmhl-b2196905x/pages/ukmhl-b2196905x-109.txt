AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGTJE 89 sometimes find the same tongue presenting distinct evidences of both ichthyosis and epitheliomatons ulcera- tion. In some cases the surface of the gums or the mucous lining of the cheeks are similarly affected at the same time, and this condition may appear independently in either of these situations. 136. Ulceration of the Tongue may be due to some cause of local irritation, or it may be associated with chronic dyspepsia, or be of a syphilitic or a cancerous (epitheliomatous) nature. Irritable Ulcers are generally caused by the irritation of rough or carious teeth, and in many cases the lips (96) and interior of the cheeks (128) are similarly affected at the same time. The ulcers, which are often multiple, are found chiefly on the margin and tip of the tongue or on the folds of the frsenum, and they are generally very painfiil, interfering with speech and mastication. They are distinguished from epithelioma by their superficial nature, by the fact that they are generally multiple, and by the absence of much or any induration about their base. Dyspeptic Ulcers are usually situated on the dorsum in the middle Hne, and often originate in psoriasis (133), so that evidence of that affection is often present along with them. They generally arise without any cause of local irritation, and the patient has usually suffered for some time from dyspepsia. This condition is diagnosed from epithelioma, which affection it resembles more closely than the preceding, by the fact that the ulcers, which are not unfrequently multiple, are usually situated at the middle of the tongue (an unusual situation for epithelioma), and not at its margins, by the absence of much induration of

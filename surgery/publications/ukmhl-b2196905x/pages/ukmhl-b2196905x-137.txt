AFFECTIONS OF THE CESOPHAGUS 117 strieture. Cicatricial or Fibrous stricture is generally tlie result ^-SS'"'" of swallowing some corrosive fluid or boiling liquid, in consequence of which the mucous lining of the ceso- phagus is more or less extensively destroyed, and the cicatricial tissue which supplies its place, afterwards undergoing contraction, causes a permanent narrowing of the tube. In rare instances, it may occur after healing has taken place in the case of ulceration affecting the oeso- phagus, usually of a specific character. This form is diagnosed from cancerous stricture, with which it is liable to be confounded, by the previous history of the case, the patient having usually swallowed at a former period some caustic fluid or boiling liquid ; by the smooth surface of the constriction felt on passing a bougie, very different from the rough, ulcerated sur- face usually found in cancer; by the fact that the patient simply brings up glairy mucus, never pus, blood, or shreds of tissue, as in cancer ; by the absence of any enlargement of the cervical glands, or of any tumour perceptible in the neck; by in many cases the age of the patient, this form often occurring in young people ; by the absence of any evidence of the cancerous cachexia, though after a time considerable emaciation may be produced, as the symptoms increase in severity, and nutrition is consequently interfered with.

Any part of the oesophagus may be affected, but the most common situation is per- haps the upper third. The disease is rarely met with before middle life, and it generally runs a rapid course, the neighbouring lymphatic glands and surrounding

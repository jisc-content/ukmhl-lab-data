136 REGIONAL STJEGEET OrbitHl Hsemor- rliage. inflammation from the cellular tissue lining tlie orbit to the subjacent bone. This condition is characterised by symptoms very similar to those accompanying orbital cellulitis, but the pain is generally of a more severe character, and in many cases necrosis of a portion of the walls of the orbit is produced. Cries or Necro- 232. Caries or Necrosis of the walls of the orbit is generally the result of periostitis (231) or cellulitis (230), symptoms of which will generally have been pre- sent ; sinuses will generally be found at some point of the margin of the orbit, discharging pus, and leading down to dead and exposed bone. 233. Hemorrhage into the Orbit may be due to spon- taneous rupture of one of the blood-vessels in its interior, but in the majority of cases it is the result of injury, a>nd is associated with fracture either of its roof or some portion of its osseous walls. If the bleeding is considerable in amount, the eye- ball will be displaced forwards (229), and ecchymosis of the eyelids and ocular conjunctiva will also be pro- duced (201). 234. In fracture of the inner or upper wall of the orbit involving the nasal cavity or frontal sinus, air may make its way into the cellular tissue of the orbit and eyelids, and more or less protrusion of the eyeball may be produced. 235. Excluding the intraocular tumours {e.ff. glioma of retina, sarcoma of choroid, &c.), the tumours met with in the orbit may be divided into two great classes, viz. : 1. Those originating in the orhit itself, connected with eitherâ€” Bone, e.g. exostosis (236), enchondroma (237), sar- coma (243). Oi'bital Enipliy seiiia. Tumours of orbit.

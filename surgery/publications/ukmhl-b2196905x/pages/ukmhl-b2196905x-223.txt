THE EARâ€”AFFECTIONS OF THE EXTERNAL MEATUS 203 X)iscMrge of Blood. is often seen in cases of fracture through the middle fossa of the hase of the skull; in other cases it may be dependent on laceration of the external meatus, or upon simple rupture of the membrana tympani unassociated with any fracture. In the former instance, as the blood comes from one of the large vascular channels at the base of the skull, the discharge is generally copious and long continued, and the haemorrhage is often followed by the discharge of a watery fluid, quite clear or tinged with blood (352). In the latter instance, the blood coming from the small vessels of the external meatus or membrana tym- pani is usually inconsiderable in quantity, and the haemorrhage soon ceases. 352. A Discharge of Watery Fluid, either clear or ^^^^ tinged with blood, following immediately a severe in- jury to the head, or preceded by copious and long-con- tinued haemorrhage from the ear (351)," is generally indicative of a fracture through the middle fossa of the base of the skull (38), whereby the prolongation of arachnoid which invests the seventh pair of nerves in the internal meatus is ruptured ; in this way, the subarach- noid space being laid open, the cerebro-spinal fluid escapes externally through a laceration in the mem- brana tympani, which will always be found to co-exist. An escape of cerebro-spinal fluid in this way must not be confounded with the simple serous discharge which may follow an injury, or be due to some inflam- matory condition, affecting the lining membrane of the external meatus or tympanum, and independent of any fracture. In the latter case there will be an absence of the usual symptoms of fractured base (38) ; the watery discharge does not immediately follow the receipt of

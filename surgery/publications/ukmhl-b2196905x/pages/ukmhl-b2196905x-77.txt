AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE 57 Polypi. Naso-pharyngeal — y^hen the polypus grows down- "•rfugtf"" wards and backwards into the pharynx, appearing behind and pushing forwards the soft palate, at the same time that it makes its way anteriorly into the nasal fossa. Naso-orlital—^hen penetrating the inner wall of the orbit, the growth makes its way into the interior of that cavity, and causes more or less displacement of the eye- ball, generally in a downward and outward direction. Sight will be more or less interfered with, and on ex- amining the interior of the nostril on the same side it will be found to be obstructed by the growth, which will be readily recognised. Carcinoma, usually of the encephaloid variety, may 3. cancerous, grow in the form of a polypus from the mucous mem- brane hning the nasal fossa; it is generally to be recog- nised by its very rapid growth, its extensive infiltra- tion of the adjacent cavities and structures, and the great deformity it produces ; it is usually accompanied by severe haemorrhage, and the growth often projects from the nostril as a fungating bleeding mass, the neighbouring lymphatic glands are involved at an early period of the disease, evidences of the cancerous cachexia soon appear, and life is speedily destroyed. 85. The other affections of the nasal cavity which are ^°"tj^g pof^i'^" liable to be mistaken for polypi are— Chronic thickening of the mucous membrane (83). Deviation of the septum to either side (89). Abscess (91), blood tumours (90), or other tumours (93) of the septum. Cartilaginous (86), or osseous tumours (87) of the nasal fossa. 86. JEnchondA'omata, or cartilaginous tumours, are EncUondroma. sometimes found in the interior of the nasal cavity,

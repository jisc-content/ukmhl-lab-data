INJURIES AND AFFECTIONS OF CERVICAL SPINE. 173 fracture of the odontoid process; it may result from injury or disease (e.g. softening and giving way of the transverse ligament which holds it in position). The symptoms of dislocation are those of compression of the spinal cord, and are almost identical with those of fracture (303), the two conditions being generally associated together. Occasionally the displacement is only momentary, the vertebrse, by the elasticity of the structures connect- ing them together, at once recovering their normal position; under these circumstances there may b-? no marked paralysis as the immediate result of the injury, but it may supervene after an interval of several days, as the result of inflammatory changes set up in the spinal cord or its membranes. 303. A fracture of the cervical portion of the spine, Fracture, involving the arch or body of the vertebra, attended with displacement of the fragments and compression of the cord opposite to or above the third cervical vertebra (i. e. above the origin of the phrenic nerve) is usually immediately fatal, death from asphyxia being produced owing to paralysis of the diaphragm and muscles of respiration. In fracture of the odontoid process, the result of injury; or separation, the result of disease (e.g. caries of the cervical vertebrae), death is usually instantaneous, owing to the sudden pressure of the displaced portion of bone upon the medulla oblongata. When the fracture takes place at any point between the third cervical and first dorsal vertebra, paralysis more or less complete of both upper and lower extremities is generally produced; breathing is much interfered with, owing to paralysis of the muscles of respiration, inspi- ration being entirely diaphragmatic; owing to loss of

AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS 75 1. Anchylosis of the Temporo-maxillary Joint, the result of etiroiiic rheumatic arthritis, or other disease affect- ing the articulation (117). 2. Cicatricial Contraction of the Soft Structures either within or without the mouth, following extensive injuries, burns, cancrum oris, lupoid, or other forms of ulcera- tion. 3. Spasmodic Contraction of the Muscles of the Jaw, due to reflex irritation, as in the case of carious or imperfectly-developed teeth; under this head may- be included trismus or lock-jaw, one of the earliest symptoms of tetanus. 4. Inflammatory Affections in the neighbourhood of the Jaw, e.g. mumps (64), parotid abscess (66), alveolar abscess (111), &c. 117. Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis is usually met with Diseases of Tem- poro-maxillary in persons somewhat advanced m life, and is character- ised by enlargement of the condyle of the jaw, with crepitation on movement, and stiffness and inability to completely open the mouth. The pain, which is usually present, is of a dull, aching kind, worse at night, and influenced by the state of the weather. If absorption of the articular eminence takes place, considerable de- formity may be produced, owing to displacement of the jaw by muscular action. In other cases, without any affection of the articular surfaces, complete closure of the jaw may be produced as the result of fibrous anchylosis from thickening and contraction of the ligamentous structures about the joint. This affection, which is sometimes met with in young people who have suffered from acute or subacute rheu- matism, develops itself much more rapidly than the preceding condition. Joint. 1.

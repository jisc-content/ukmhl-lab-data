AFFECTIONS OF SCALP AND VAULT OF CRANIUM 19 * Paget, ' Medico-Chirurg. Trans.,' vol. Ix. 31. A sinus behind the ear, discharging pus and ^^jiagto\^''pj.o leading down to bare bone, is often found in cases of <=esa. disease of the mastoid process (361). In other in- stances, it may simply be the result of non-closure of the cavity of an abscess which has formed in the soft tissues, or in connection with the lymphatic glands in this situation (14). 32. We find two types of head associated with ^''''P^ of rickets. Rickets. In some cases it is of a square shape, as though flattened on its superior, lateral, and antero-posterior aspects, so that the forehead and parietal protuberances are unduly prominent (33), In other cases it is long and narrow, as though com- pressed from side to side, the forehead projecting and its antero-posterior diameter being unusually length- ened. At the same time we find that the sutures and fon- tanelles are late in closing, and craniotabes (29) is occasionally present. 33. Hypertrophy, or enlargement and thickenins of Hypertrophy , . ° ° Cranium. tiie bones ot the cranmm, may be due to various causes. It may be dependent upon simple chronic inflammatory changes, the result of injury, syphilis, or struma; or it may be due to rickets, ostitis deformans, leontiasis ossea. It is also produced in some cases of osteo- malacia. In Rickets the bones of the cranium, especially the «• Ricketg! parietal and frontal eminences, are often much thick- ened, and consequently unduly prominent (32), owing to the development of new osseous tissue from the deeper layers of the periosteum. In Ostitis deformans* the cranium very slowly and i. OstitiR de-

Diseases of Tem- poro-maxillary Joint. 76 EEGIONAL SUEGEEY As the result of disease commencing in the synovial ^'^"umtis!^^^ membrane, condyloid process, or glenoid cavity, erosion of the cartilages, with destruction of the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and absorption of the articular surfaces entering into the formation of the joint, may be pro- duced. If suppuration occurs, more or less disorganisation of the articulation will ensue, and sinuses will be often found in the neighbourhood of the joint discharging pus, and leading down to dead and exposed bone. This condition is sometimes met with in children as the sequel of one of the exanthemata, or it may show itself in the course of a case of pyaemia. When occurring in young children, a movable jaw by the formation of a new joint sometimes results, but in the majority of cases anchylosis more or less complete will be produced. 118. As the result of external injury, neglected frac- ture, or other causes, acute periostitis may be produced. This will manifest itself as a hot and jjainful swelling, deeply situated, and connected with the body of the jaw, and accompanied by more or less redness and oedema of the soft structures covering it. If suppura- tion (periosteal abscess) occurs between the periosteum and the bone, fluctuation will be detected, and after evacuating the pus a probe will probably come into contact with bare bone, and necrosis of its superficial portion may result in consequence of its being denuded of its periosteal covering. In the chronic form the symptoms are much less evident and severe: there is more or less enlargement of the body of the jaw, not distinctly circumscribed, and attended by pain of a dull aching character, aggravated at intervals, and especially worse at night.

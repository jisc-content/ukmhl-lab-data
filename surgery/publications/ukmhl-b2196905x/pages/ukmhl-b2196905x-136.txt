Stricture of the (Esophagus may be spasmodic or organic in its nature, and organic stricture may again be either simple or fibrous, or malignant or cancerous. 1. Spasmodic Spasmodic Stricture generally occurs in young or middle-aged females of a nervous or hysterical temper- ament, and the obstruction is due to spasm affecting the constrictor muscles of the lower part oE the pharynx rather than those of the oesophagus itself; when occur- ing in these subjects, it is sometimes termed " Hysterical or Nervous stricture." In some cases, this form of stricture is associated with some slight ulceration of the mucous lining of the oeso- phagus, which may be of a simple, syphilitic, or trau- matic nature, the spasm being then the result of reflex irritation ; under these circumstances, it is sometimes termed *' Irritative or Beflex stricture." The diagnosis of the affection can usually be made by attention to the following points : the age, sex, and temperament of the patient; the intermittent nature of the symptoms, which are entirely absent at times, and are aggravated when the patient's attention is directed to them ; the disappearance of the resistance, which is at first offered to the passage of a bougie, on making steady and firm pressure ; and also its complete absence when the patient is under the influence of an anaesthetic.

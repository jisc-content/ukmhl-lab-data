INJURIES OF THE HEAD 31 /3. When Cerebral—viz. wlien tlie haemorrhage is de- pendent upon laceration of some portion of the brain, and when the extravasation takes place into its sub- stance, the interval of consciousness does not occur, but the symptoms of concussion are speedily followed by those of compression. In these cases the patient is generally restless and excited ; the paralysis is usually incomplete, and conviilsive movements and twitching of the limbs are often associated with it, affecting chiefly the side of the body opposite to that which is the seat of the cerebral lesion. 2. Depressed Bone or a Foreign Body. When due to the presence of depressed bone or the lodgment of a foreign body, the symptoms of compres- sion are present from the first, following the injury at once without any interval of consciousness. 3. Pus formed within the skull. When due to the presence of pus, the symptoms of compression come on a considerable time after the re- ceipt of the injury, often not for ten or fourteen days, and are preceded by symptoms of inflammation of the brain or its membranes, e.g. considerable pyrexia, great heat of head, hot skin, quick pulse, flushed face, pain in the head, intolerance of light and sound, and more or less delirium. Rigors often occur in the later stages of the inflammatory process, and are usually diagnostic of the commencement of sup- puration. When present, Pott's puffy tumour (22) is a valuable indication of the formation of pus within the skull. Diagnosis of Compression. the side opposite to that which was the seat of in- — ^.

This condition, which is common amongst clergymen or those who use the voice much in public speahing, is familiarly known as " clergymen's sore throat" (317). 176. In strumous children, the mucous membrane lining the pharynx is often thickened and relaxed, and the glandular follicles are hypertrophied and rendered more prominent than usual. This condition is the result of a low form of chronic inflammation, the glandular tissue at the back of the pharynx becoming the seat of changes somewhat similar to what occur in the tonsils, for hypertrophy of these structures (170) is often found to coexist. The enlargement of the lymphatic glands in the neck (248), so common in these subjects, is in many cases due to irritation propagated from the pharynx, in the lymphoid tissues of which a number of their radicles originate. 177. In constitutional syphilis the phaiynx may be- come affected in various ways, e.g.: 1. Erythema.—hi the very early stage, and correspond- ino- with the period of macular eruption (roseola) on the skin an erythematous redness often spreads over the posterior surface of the pharynx, most marked on the velum palati, pillars of fauces, and tonsils, distmctly defined, usually symmetrical, and sometimes going on to very superficial ulceration. 2 Mucous Patches or Tubercles.—At a stage somewhat more advanced, and correspondmg with the period of papular (lichen) and squamous (psoriasis) eruptions on the skin, the same parts may become the seat of mucous patches or tubercles. These present themselves as broad, flattened, slightly raised patches, of a pale-

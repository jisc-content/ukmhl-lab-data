TUMOTTES OF SCALP AND VATTLT OF CRANITTM 15 Tumours of Traumatic Origin, and inner table, is generally followed by intracranial suppuration (i. e. between the bone and dura mater). 23. A circumscribed swelling connected witb the bone Nodes, and periosteum, attended by considerable pain, worse at night, appearing on the cranium shortly after the receipt of an injury, is a traumatic node, the result of a localised inflammation of the periosteum. 24. A fungating mass, of ten pulsating synchronously Semia Cerebri, with the brain, consisting of cerebral substance, more or less mingled with inflammatory products, following laceration or sloughing of the dura mater, the result of a compound fracture of the skull, or the removal of a portion of the skull-cap with a trephine for injury or disease, is a hernia cerebri or protrusion of the brain. It is termed a false hernia cerebri when the protruded mass consists mainly of inflammatory exudation and granulation tissue, and true hernia cerebri when it is composed chiefly of real cerebral substance. 25. A small fluctuating swelling, situated upon some Collections of ^ . . ^ . . cerehro-apiiial part of the vault of the cranium, in some cases exhibit- fluid, ing slight pulsation, more or less completely reducible, varying in size from time to time, but generally be- coming larger and more tense during violent expiratory efforts or on lowering the head, usually occurring in children, and following an injury to the head, generally unaccompanied by any external wound, is a collection of cerebrospinal fluid beneath the tissues of the scalp.* This condition is generally the result of a simple fracture of the vault of the sliull, whereby the subarach- noid space, or possibly one of the ventricular cavities of the brain having been laid open, the cerebro-spinal fluid escapes through the crack or fissure in the bone, and gives rise to the localised swelling beneath the tissues * Clemtiut Lucas,' Guy's Hospital Reports,' 1876, 1881.

72 REGIONAL SURGERY periosteum, or in the soft tissues after it has made its way through the periosteum, may find an exit on the surface of the cheek, and a fistulous opening may result, very similar to that which is often found in connection with necrosis of the jaw, the diseased tooth acting like a sequestrum, and preventing the sinus (at the bottom of which it can oftenbe felt with a probe) from closing. The formation of an alveolar abscess is usually attended by considerable pain and tenderness on pressure, and the swelling which results is of an elastic and fluctuating character, in some cases localised and confined to the alveolar margin of the jaw, in others widely spread and accompanied by considerable fulness of the cheek. Necrosis 112. Necrosis of the jaw is a common result of peri- ostitis (118) from any cause ; it may occur as a result of injury, e. g. fracture ; it may follow one of the erup- tive fevers, or be caused by the exposure to the fumes of phosphorus in persons engaged in lucifer match factories; in other cases it may be due to scrofula, syphilis, or salivation by mercury, and it may also occur in apparently healthy subjects without any assignable cause. The necrosis, which may attack either the body or alveolar margin of the jaw, is generally preceded by more or less pain and swelling in the affected part, and sinuses are usually present leading down to bare bone, and opening either externally upon the cheek, chin, or beneath the margin of the jaw, or internally into the mouth, and discharging a fetid pus which poisons the breath. In phosphorus necrosis, which more commonly attacks the lower jaw, and is caused by the acid fumes gaining access to the bone through the sockets of carious teeth, the sequestrum, which is always slow in separat-

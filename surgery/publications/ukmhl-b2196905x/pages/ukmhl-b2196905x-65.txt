In either case the tumour is of a more or less rapid growth, deep- seated, and immovahle, with ill-defined outline. As it in- creases in size, surrounding parts become infiltrated and incorporated with the new growth, serious pressure effects being produced. The skin covering it becomes adherent, discoloured, and the seat of ulceration, and, in the case of cancer, the neighbouring lymphatic glands become at the same time enlarged, points of importance as serving to distinguish between the simple and malienant varieties of tumour found in this situation. 64. Pain or swelling in one or both parotid regions, with stiffness of the neck, accompanied by slight febrile disturbance, and occurring usually in children, is ^arofiiis or mumps, a contagious inflammatory affection of the parotid gland, which may occur sporadically or prevail as an epidemic. The swelling gradually estends from below and in front of the ear (the situation of the parotid), along the side of the neck, as the submaxillary and subliagual sali- vary and the neighbouring lymphatic glands generally become secondarily involved. In the course of a few days the swelling gradually subsides, it being very rare for suppuration to occur. "Metastasis" occasionally takes place, that is to say, the inflammation may sud- denly leave the parotid and attack the testicle, or more rarely the mammary gland. 65. Inflammation of the Parotid Gland is not un- Aiiscess or common as a complication or sequela of some of the eruptive fevers, e. g. typhus, variola, scarlatina; more rarely, it may occur idiopathically or in the course of a case of pyaemia ; under these conditions suppuration very often takes place, differing in this respect from

AFFECTIONS OF THE ORBIT 135 produced by the presence of a tumour of the orbit, therefore in all cases when there is the slightest doubt, recourse should be had to exploratory puncture. 231. PeriostUis, when attacking the bones of the PencsHUs^ orbit, is generally of a chronic nature, and^ is, in the i- ci.ron.c. majority of cases, due to constitutional syphilis. The nodes or periosteal swellings which result usually present themselves as firm and painful swellings ; they may affect any of the four walls of the orbit, but their favourite situations are the inner portion of the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and the superior and inferior margins of the orbit. When the swelling is of some size, and occurring at some depth within its cavity, protrusion of the eyeball may be produced, along with loss of vision consequent upon stretching of the optic nerve, and in many cases paralysis of some of the ocular muscles is also present. Syphilitic periostitis may be accompanied or followed by orbital cellulitis, which may go on to suppuration and the formation of an abscess, and in many cases, caries or necrosis of the subjacent bones will be pro- duced (232). The same result may follow softening and breaking down of a syphilitic node. In other cases the nodes may ossify and give rise to a syphilitic exostosis (236). In cases where the lachrymal bone or adjacent parts become affected, changes may occur in the lachrymal passages, giving rise to more or less complete obstruc- tion to the flow of tears (Epiphora, 224). Acute inflammation of the periosteum is sometimes 2.

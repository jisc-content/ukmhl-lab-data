EEGIONAL SUJRGEET 166 Wounds o/lhroai. Immediate Dausera. Secondary jjangcrs. 3. Through the larynx, dividing the thyroid, or cricoid cartilages, or crico-thyroid membrane. 4. Tlivough the trachea, dividing the windpipe, either partially or completely. If the wound is above the level of the cricoid carti- lage, it may involve the pharynx; while if below the oesophagus itself may be injured. In cases where the air-passages are wounded, air will bubble in and out of the wound during respira- tion, and when the external wound is small, or does not correspond in position with that in the larynx or trachea, emphysema (277) is very liable to super- vene. When the pharynx or oesophagus are involved, food will probably pass out of the external wound on attempts to swallow. If any of the large blood-vessels are divided, the hismorrhage may be so profuse as to cause almost instant death. 280. The Immediate Bangers attending- a wound of the throat are— 1. Death from haemorrhage, which is liable to occur if the large vessels (carotid artery, jugular vein) are divided. 2. Death from asphyxia, either from blood flowing into the trachea, or from portions of tissue which have been either partially or completely divided falling over or into the larynx, exciting spasm of the glottis, and m this way causing obstruction to respiration. 3. Death from entrance of air into one of the large veins, especially those at the root of the neck. 281. The Secondary Bangers coming on in the course of a few days are— 1. Inflammation of the larynx, leading to codema glottidis (313).

146 EEGIONAL SXTEGERY Affections of Lym- phatic Gland}. — wHcli it is in fhe early stage very liable to be mistaken, by attention to the following points. In scrofula the affected glands remain freely mov- able, forming no deep attachments ; they remain sepa- rate from one another, and are of softish consistence ; their rate of growth is generally very slow; there is an absence of much, if any, pain; inflammatory symptoms may be entirely absent, or there may be some tender- ness on pressure, with external redness often of a dusky colour, and slight increase of local temperature; the lower cervical glands are most frequently involved in senile scrofula, while malignant disease usually attacks 1 those at the upper part of the neck. The patient will perhaps have been the subject of scrofulous affections during early life, and on inquiry it will probably be found that other members of the family have suffered from similar symptoms; or there will perhaps be a history of phthisis. Of course, when, as is often the case, the glands break down and suppu- rate, the diagnosis will be evident. In constitutional syphilis, often as a part of a general glandular infection, the suboccipital glands, those lying over the sterno-mastoid just below the ear, or those along the anterior margin of the trapezius, may become slightly enlarged and indurated; this condition, which is of a painless nature, and usually involves both sides of the neck, never goes on to suppuration. 249.

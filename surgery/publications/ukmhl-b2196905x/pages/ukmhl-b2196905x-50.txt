Diagnosis of Con- cussion and Compression. 30 EEaiOSTAL SURaERT Diagnosis of Coni' pression. 1. Extravasa- ted Blood. a. Meuin- Bladder Bowels Vomiting Voluntary muscles Concussion. Not paralysed; but owing to relaxation of its sphincter, there is often an involun- tary flow of urine There is no paralysis ; but owing to relaxa- tion of the sphincter ani,there are'of ten in- voluntary discharges of f'ajces Often comes-on as the symptoms of concus- sion pass away Not paralysed, though often flaccid and much relaxed. Sphincters not para- lysed, but simply re- laxed Compression. Paralysed, therefore retention of urine is often present, followed after a time by in- continence, the result of overflow from a distended bladder. Paralysis of sphincter ani is present, and as a result in- voluntary evacuations often occur; or the bowels may be torpid and constipated. Not generally present. Paralysed, generally on one side of the body, and oppo- site to that which is the seat of compression. Sphincters are completely paralysed. Compression of the Brain may, as previously stated, be due to several causes, e. g. ; 1. Extravasation of Blood upon the surface of the brain or its membranes, or into its substance. a. When Meningealâ€”viz. when the extravasation takes place upon the surface of the brain or its membranes, without laceration of its substance, the symptoms of compression come on after an interval of consciousness more or less complete. The injury is followed by symptoms of concussion, from which the patient more or less perfectly recovers; then, after an interval of consciousness, symptoms of com- pression set in, and as these increase in severity he falls into a state of coma, more or less profound, accompanied by general paralysis or hemiplegia of

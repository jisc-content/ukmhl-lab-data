Extravasation of hlood occurring in the scalp may take place in one of three situations, viz, a. Cutaneous—in the integument superficial to the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis tendon. 13. Subaponeurotic—in the loose cellular tissue be- neath the occipito-frontalis, between the muscle or its tendon, and the pericranium, y. Subpericanial—between the pericranium and the bone. o. Cutaneous. When extravasation of blood occurs in the dense cellular tissue which connects the skin to the occipito- frontalis and its tendinous aponeurosis, it is usually limited in extent, presenting itself as a small, well- defined, more or less hard unyielding swelling. When extravasation takes place in the loose cellular tissue between the tendon of the occipito-frontalis and the pericranium, owing to the laxity of the tissue in this situation, it is usually much more widely spread, in some cases extending over one side or even the whole of the scalp, the swelling being generally most promi- nent in the temporal region. This variety most com- monly occurs in children as the result of a fall or blow. When limited, the fluctuating swelling which is formed may simulate an abscess, from which, however, it may be distinguished by the absence of any symptoms of inflammation, and also by the history of the case. The blood-tumour, which is formed in the cellular tissue between the pericranium and bones of the skull, usually occurs in new-born children as the result of pressure upon the head during delivery. Owing to the connection between the pericranium and the subjacent bones being especially strong at the p. SubaponeU' rotic. y. Subpericra- nial.

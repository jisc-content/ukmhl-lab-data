INJURIES OF THE NECK Foreign Bodies in the Air-passages. another common accident is the impaction of a large portion of food in the lower part of the pharynx, which by obstructing the orifice of the larynx may cause death from asphyxia. A foreign body may be lodged— 1. At the orifice of the larynx, just above the rima glottidis. 2. In the interior of the larynx, e.g. in one of the ventricles, or between the vocal cords. 3. In the trachea. 4. In one of the bronchi or their subdivisions ; ■ if a foreign body is not arrested in the trachea, it passes more commonly into the right bronchus, for though this bronchus lies more horizontally than the left, yet it is of somewhat larger size, and the septum between the two is placed slightly to the left of the median line. The symptoms attending the entrance of a foreign body are those of irritation of the air-passages and obstruction to respiration, viz. fits of spasmodic cough, great dyspnoea and a feeling of suffocation ; they vary, however, considerably with its size and shape, and also with its situation, fpr the larger and rougher the foreign body and the nearer it is situated to the vocal cords, the more urgent are the symptoms. If situated in the larynx, the symptoms are generally in Larynx, very severe, and death often speedily results from spasm of the glottis; in other cases, there is a feeling of in- tense suffocation and urgent dyspnoea, with constant cough, aggravated from time to time; respiration is stridulous, and the voice is altered or lost; pain is often experienced in the neighbourhood of the larynx, and the foreign body can sometimes be felt from the mouth, or be detected with the laryngoscope. If situated in the trachea, the symptoms are usually in Trachea.

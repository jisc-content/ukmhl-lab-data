AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK 155 (jg^fotii Aneurism. witli perhaps a reddened condition of the integuments covering it, will in most cases serve to distinguisli a simple abscess lying over the vessels from a carotid aneurism. BroncUcele.â€”ln cases where one lobe only of the 3. Bronchoceie. thyroid gland is enlarged, extending laterally over the carotid artery and having pulsation transmitted to it, or in cases of pulsating bronchoceie (267), where the swelling pulsates by virtu^ of its own inherent vascu- larity, the diagnosis, which at first may appear some- what difficult, can usually be made by attention to the following points : 1. Though one of the lobes may be chiefly involved in bronchoceie, yet the isthmus is always more or less enlarged. 2. In bronchoceie the mesial portion of the tumour is that which is most firmly fixed ; while in aneurism it is the most external portion, viz. that which lies beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle. 3. During deglutition the enlarged gland moves with the larynx ; in the case of aneurism, the tumour remains immovable. 4. If a bronchoceie is raised up from the subja- cent vessels, the pulsation which it exhibits more or less completely ceases; this is not the case in aneurism. 260. An Aneurism at the Boot of the Neck may be con- Aneunsm^at Root nected with the carotid, subclavian, or innominate arteries, or possibly with the arch of the aorta ; in the following table are laid down the main points of dis- tinction between the three first varieties, but in many cases, unless the condition comes under observation at an early period, it is impossible to determine with which vessel the aneurism is connected.

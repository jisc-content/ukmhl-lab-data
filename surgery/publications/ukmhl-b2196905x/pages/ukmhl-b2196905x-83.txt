AFFECTIONS OF LIPS 63 * Morgan, ' Lancet/ 1881, vol. ii, p. 289. Cheek*—In rare cases congenital fissures, involving the whole thickness of the cheek, are found extending from the angle of the mouth as far as the anterior border of the masseter muscle, or upwards towards the malar bone. At. times this condition is found associated with the presence of supernumerary auricles (328). 95. Ulceration of the Lip may be due to various Ulceration of Lip. causes, e.g.: 1. Simple, in connection with herpes labialis (96) ; fissure, or cracked lip (97); irritable and dyspeptic ulceration of the tongue and mucous lining of the cheeks (135); stomatitis (127). 2. Strumous.—'In strumous subjects, or in those suffering from a low state of health, superficial ulcera- tions and cracks or fissures, in many cases of a very irtractable character, are often found affecting both the upper and lower lips. 3. Syphilitic, in the form of a chancre or primary sore (98), or accompanying the superficial form of syphilitic ulceration of the tongue and mucous lining of the cheeks (135). 4. Cancerous, in the form of epithelioma (99). 96. Herpes labialis is characterised by an eruption of B-erpea kbiaiis. small vesicles, which soon dry up and form a crust or scab, or bursting, leave a superficial ulceration. This condition is often found in connection with slight catarrh, or accompanying an attack of pneumonia. 97. Fissure of the Lip, or "Cracked lip," is of ten rissure of Lip- found as the result of exposure to cold. The crack is " ^^^'=''^'1 i^'p- usually situated near the centre of the lower lip, in- volving only its mucous surface, being attended by much pain, and readily bleeding if its edges are acci- deatally separated from each other.

EEGUONAL SUEGEET 210 Eustachian Ob- 359 a. Inasmuch as it is tlie function of the Eusta- struction. "Throat Deaf- cliiaii tubc, by admitting air from the pharynx into the interior of the tympanum, to maintain an equal atmo- spheric pressure upon the two surfaces of the membrana tympani, it follows that in obstruction of this tube from any cause, owing to absorption of air in the tym- panum,. the atmospheric pressure on the outer surface of the drum-head will be greater than that on its inner aspect. In consequence, the inward curvature of the drum- head is increased, arid with it the chain of ossicula are forced somewhat inwards, so that undue pressure is exerted by the base of the stapes through the fenestra ovalis upon the perilymph which surrounds the mem- branous labyrinth ; the result of this is that the vibra- tions of air (by which sound is produced), falling upon the membrana tympani, do not produce the same efiect upon the internal ear, as in cases when the nonnal equilibrium is preserved. Hence deafness is caused as the result of obstruction of the Eustachian tube, so- called "throat deafness." Eustachian obstruction may be due to several causes, e.g.: Simple catarrh of the mucous membrane lining the tube, the result in many cases of extension of inflam- mation from the throat. Thickening and hypertrophy of the mucous mem- brane about the faucial opening of the tube, a condi- tion which is in many instances associated with hyper- trophy of the tonsils. Pharyngeal tumours; naso-pharyngeal polypi; ade- noid vegetations in the naso-pharynx; constriction or stricture of the tube itself ; closure by a plug of inspis- sated mucus, foreign bodies, &c. In cases where deafness is simply due to this cause,

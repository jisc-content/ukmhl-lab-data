1 132 EEGIONAIi STTEGEET Obstruction of Canaliculi. Obstruction of iKasal Duct. Inflammatory affections of tlie eyelids, e.g. tinea tarsi (195), hordeolum (197), abscess (198), ulceration (199), &c. Tumours of the eyelids (203). Cicatricial contraction in the case of wounds or ulceration involving the eyelids. 227. Obstruction of the CawaKcwZi may be produced by any of the same causes which give rise to displacement (226) or closure (226) of the puncta. 228. Obstruction of the Nasal Duct may be due toâ€” 1. Stricture. Stricture, or closure of the nasal duct, partial or complete, is generally the result of chronic inflammatory thickening of the mucous and submucous tissue, or periosteum, lining the interior of the canal. This condition may arise idiopathically without any apparent cause, or as the result of injury; it may occur in strumous subjects, or as one of the evidences of con- stitutional syphilis; or as a consequence of periostitis or necrosis of the bones forming the walls of the duct. If a pf obe is passed along the duct, it will be arrested at the seat of obstruction, and, after the condition has existed for some time, inflammation of the lachrymal sac (222), with epiphora (224), will probably be pro- duced. 2. Mechanical pressure from tumours, springing from the antrum (103), interior of nose or base of skull (84), or from any adjacent part. ( I

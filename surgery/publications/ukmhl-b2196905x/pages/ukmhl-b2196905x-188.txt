The injury is characterised by a depression at the seat of rupture, and is soon followed by extensive em- physema (277); great dyspncBa is produced, and death from asphyxia is very likely to occur. In rare instances a rupture or rent in the treaehea is produced as the result of violent respii-atory efforts, e.g. in croup or whooping-cough in children; in severe attacks of bronchitis; in the violent expiratory efforts of parturition. ^'of Larynx!"'"" ^^'^' 'S^cciZc^s of the Larynx often occur in young chil- dren from the accidental swallowing of boiling water; as the direct result of the injury, the interior of the pharynx or larynx becomes the seat of acute inflam- mation, and oedema glottidis (313) is often produced ; this, if severe, speedily destroys life from suffocation.

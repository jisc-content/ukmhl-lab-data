CHAPTER II AFFECTIONS OF SCALP AND VAULT OF CEANItTBI b. Cutaneous. 26. Phlegmonous or Cellulo-cutaneous.—A hot, tense, Erysipelas, painful swelling of the scalp, spreading rapidly over the " monous. whole or greater part of the head, and often involving the face, attended by considerable oedema, showing a great tendency to terminate in suppuration and slough- ing of the soft structures, so that the pericranium is often destroyed and the bone exposed, accompanied by rigors and severe constitutional disturbance, is phleg- monous or cellulo-cutaneous erysipelas, probably ap- pearing in connection with some injury to the scalp. CzitoeoMs.—When of an idiopathic nature, viz. occur- ing without any external wound, the cutaneous tissues only are often involved, and under these circumstances the affection generally runs its course without being attended by formation of pus. 27. A sinus, or unhealthy ulcerated surface, dis- Necrosis, charging fetid pus, with the surrounding soft parts thick- ened, infiltrated, and undermined, leading down to bare bone, which can be detected with a probe, is found in cases of necrosis of the bones of the cranium, the result probably of syphilis, struma, or some injury which has been followed by destruction of the perios- teum, and consequent death of the subjacent bone. 28.

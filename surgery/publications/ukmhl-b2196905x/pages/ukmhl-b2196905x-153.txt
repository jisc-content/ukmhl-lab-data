Emphysema of the connective tissue of the orbit (234). 6. Tumours of the orbit, either originating in its interior, or extending into it from without (235). 7. Affections of the lachrymal gland, either inflam- matory, or dependent upon the presence of new growths (218â€”221). 8. Distension of the frontal sinus (61). 9. Paralysis of the muscles of the eyeball, in conse- quence of which the globe drops forward and is rendered unduly prominent. 10.

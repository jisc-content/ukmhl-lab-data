Fractures of Skull. 2. Middle i'ossa. 28 EEGIONAL SXJRGEB.T 3. Posterior Fossa. Complications of Injuries to the Head. Concussion. Discharge of a clear watery fluid (ceretro-spinal) from the nostrils is very rarely present (88). 2. Middle Fossa.—In fractures through the middle fossa involving the petrous portion of the temporal bone, hsemorrhage from the ear is often present, owing to rupture of the membrana tympani and escape of blood from one of the vascular channels at the base of the skull which has been wounded in the fracture (351). Discharge of clear watery fluid from the ear is often associated with the hsemorrhage, and is due to escape of cerebro-spinal fluid, owing to the prolongation of arachnoid which accompanies the seventh pair of nerves having been laid open, when the fracture involves the internal auditory canal (352). Paralysis of the facial nerve and deafness are often present (58). 3. Posterior Fossa.—Fractures involving the posterior fossa are often followed by extravasation of blood in the neighbourhood of the mastoid process, or in the occipital region, or at the side of the neck; in many instances there will be tenderness on pressure over the mastoid process, and when the mastoid cells are involved emphysema may be also present (277). 39. Any injury of the head, whether it be a simple contusion, scalp wound, or fracture of the skull, may be followed by symptoms of concussion or compression of the hrain. Concussion.—Bj concussion of the brain is meant the state of shock or nervous depression which follows an injury to the head, and which in some cases is said to depend upon simple disturbance of the cerebral circulation, while in others it is attended by some visible lesion of the brain or its blood-vessels (contusion of brain substance or minute extravasations of blood).

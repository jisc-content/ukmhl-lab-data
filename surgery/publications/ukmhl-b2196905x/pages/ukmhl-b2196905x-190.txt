Secondary f.ffecta. less severe, and there are often long intervals of freedom from spasm, which is, however, often excited on any movement of the hody, or on violent expiratory efforts, by which the foreign body is driven up so aa to strike against the larynx; in many cases the patient will be conscious of its movements up and down the trachea. If the ear is applied to the front of the chest, the foreign body, if loose, can be often heard moving up and down in the windpipe; if fixed, its position can be often determined by the obstruction which is offered to the free passage of air beyond it during inspiration. If situated in one of the hronchi, the entrance of air into the corresponding lung will be partially or entirely prevented; consequently there will be a more or less complete absence of respiratory murmur, without dul- ness on percussion, while in the opposite lung the breath sounds will probably be exaggerated. If situated in one of the subdivisions of either bronchus, the same conditions will be present in the lobe con- nected with the obstructed bronchus (which may become collapsed), though air passes freely into the remainder of the lung. 289. Supposing a foreign body is not extracted or expelled, and that death does not result from spasm of the glottis, inflammation of the air-passages (laryngitis or bronchitis) will probably be set up, and this extend- ing to and involving the lung (pueumonia) will be very liable to be followed by a fatal result, or, the foreign body, if situated in one of the bronchi, may ulcerate into the lungs and ultimately give rise to all the symptoms of phthisis ; or, making its way into the pleura, may give rise to empyema. If smooth and round, it may occasionally remain im- pacted in the lower part of the trachea, or one of its

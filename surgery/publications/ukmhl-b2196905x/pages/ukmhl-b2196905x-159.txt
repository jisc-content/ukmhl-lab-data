AFrECTIONS OF THE OEBIT Tumours of Orbit. bruit is often audible; singing in tbe ears is often present; the patient generally complains of a whizzing noise in the head, and more or less pain in the orbit. On stooping down, or on any exertion, the symptoms are all increased in severity, while on compressing the common carotid artery on the same side they are di- minished, the pulsation being arrested, and the protru- sion of the eyeball more or less completely disap- pearing. These symptoms may be due to several different con- ditions, viz ;— 1. Aneimsm, true or false, of the ophthalmic artery, or one of its branches—where the sac is formed by one or more of the coats of the vessel. 2. Consecutive or diffused aneurism —where one of the arteries of the orbit, or the sac of an aneurism (true or false), having given way, extravasation of blood has taken place, and the sac is formed by condensation of the surrounding tissue. This is the most frequent form of orbital aneurism, and is generally due to an injury affecting the orbit or side of the head; when the result of injury, the tumour generally shows itself somewhat suddenly, and the patient is often sensible of something having given way, a kind of snap or crack being felt, along with a sudden attack of pain in the orbit. 3. Erectile tumours—of the nature of cirsoid aneurism and aneuri&m by anastomosis (7)—where the tumour is made up of a mass of tortuous and dilated arteries and capillaries packed together. 4. Arterio-venous aneurism—i.e. a communication between the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus ; in these cases, which are of very rare occurrence, the

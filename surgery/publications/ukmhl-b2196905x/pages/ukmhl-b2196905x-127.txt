AFFECTIONS OF THE TONSILS 107 the multiplicity, in many cases, and also by the sym- metry of the ulcers, by the absence of induration and aversion of the edges, and by the history and other evidences of the presence of syphilis, 172. Malignant Disease may attack the tonsil in the Malignant Dis- form either of sarcoma or carcinoma. Carcinoma. Sarcoma, usually of the round-celled variety, is the most common variety of malignant tumour, but carci- noma is also met with in the form of epithelioma, en- cepJialoid, or more rarely scirrhous cancer. Epithelioma usually appears as a deep foul ulcer, with indurated and everted edges. It may attack the tonsil primarily, or be due to extension of disease from the tongue, palate, or pillars of the fauces. Sarcomata and encephaloid cancer show themselves as prominent, rapidly growing tumours, soon involving the surround- ing structures, and, in the case of cancer, soon accom- panied by enlargement of the lymphatic glands at the angle of the jaw and side of the neck. The epitheliomatous ulcer may simulate that which is found in syphilis from the breaking down of a gummatous deposit (171), but the induration of the base and eversion of the edges of the ulcer, the rapid progress of the disease and implication of the surround- ing structures (pillars of the fauces, base of tongue, and neighbouring glands), the more advanced age of the patient in many cases, the fact that no improvement results from specific treatment, and the absence of other symptoms of syphilis, will usually enable one to readily diagnose between the two affections. 173 Calculi occasionally form in the substance of the Caicuii. tonsil, give rise to a more or less painful enlargement of the gland. In some cases suppuration is set up, and

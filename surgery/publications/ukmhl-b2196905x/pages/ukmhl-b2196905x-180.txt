160 EEGIONAL SUEGEET Lipoma, shoulders, appearing as slowly-growing, soft, semi- elastic swellings; often distinctly lobulated and in some cases reaching large dimensions ; they are usually unattended by any pain, and seldom give rise to much inconvenience unless from their size. When the skin is moved over a fatty tumour, or if its base is compressed so as to make the skin tense over it, slight dimpling is often produced, owing to the skin being more closely attached and bound down to the interspaces between the lobules of the tumour than to other parts. These growths are liable to few degenerations, and are of an innocent nature, not recurring after removal; a curious fact in connection with them is that they occasionally shift their position, slowly travelling to some distance from their original situation. They may be diagnosed from chronic abscess, with which they are liable to be mistaken, by the absence of fluctuation, their soft solid feel, their lobulated surface, the dimpling of the skin over them, and their slow growth ; in some cases, when the diagnosis is difficult, recourse to exploratory puncture may be required. The neck is sometimes the seat of the diffused fatty tumour, an ill-defined, non-encapsuled outgrowth of adipose tissue, which, without constituting a distinct disease, may give rise to considerable deformity, this condition may affect any part of the neck^ and when attacking the front often gives rise to the so- called " double-chin," SeiiaceouB Cyst. 269. Sehaceous Cysts are not uncommonly met with about the back of the neck and shoulders, presenting characters very similar to those described as occurring on the scalp (6). They may be distinguished from lipomata by their

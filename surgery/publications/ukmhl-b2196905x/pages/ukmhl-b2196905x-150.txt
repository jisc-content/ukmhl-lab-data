REGIONAL STTRGEEY 130 Tumours of Lacliryraal Gland. liiflummation of ' Uacryo- eystiiis." a. Mucocele. They may be the result of a penetratmg wound in- volving the gland, or of a lachrymal abscess (222), or cyst (219), which has burst externally. 221. The lachrymal gland is very rarely the seat of new growths of a sarcomatous or cancerous nature. The symptoms would be identical with those charac- teristic of tumours of the orbit (235), the situation of the tumour corresponding with the position of the gland, and causing displacement of the eyeball, usually in a forward, downward and inward direction. 222. Inflammation of the Lachrymal 8ac—Dacryo-cys- sac.^'"""'^"'^ titis—m&j be of an acute or a chronic nature, and is in the majority of cases secondary to obstruction of the nasal duct (228). When of a chronic nature, there will be increased lachrymation with distension of the sac, which will present itself as a more or less prominent sweUing, " Mucocele," beneath the sliin at the inner canthus; pressure upon the swelling will cause it to disappear more or less completely, its contents, which consist of a mucoid or muco-purulent secretion, being forced either downwards into the nose through the nasal duct, or upwards through the canaliculi. When of an acute character, going on to the forma- tion of a " Lachrymal abscess," there will be more pain, with redness and swelling of the parts around the sac; the lachrymal sac itself becomes tense and distended with pus, which generally discharges itself externally, making its may to the surface in most cases at a pomt iust below the tendo palpebrarum ; after the evacuation of the pus the opening may close, or a lachrymal fistula (215) may result. Distension of the frontal sinus (61) maybe mistaken for a distended lachrymal sac; in the latter case the Liaclirymal Abscess.

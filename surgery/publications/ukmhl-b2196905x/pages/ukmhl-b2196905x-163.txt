This condition, which is often described as " Strumous strumous. adenitis," usually manifests itself as an indolent and slightly painful enlargement of the glands, most com- monly of those beneath the jaw or along the border of the sterno-mastoid. The affected glands may become fused together, but more commonly they remain isolated from one another, forming swellings, often unattended after a time by any pain or tenderness, more or less hard, and of uniform consistence, freely movable and rolling under the finger, the overlying skia being non- adherent and unaffected. The glands may remain in this condition for a con- siderable period and resolution may then take place, or, more commonly, they bi-eak down and suppurate, giving rise to the formation of an abscess (256).

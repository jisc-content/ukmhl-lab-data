Angular Curvature, due to caries and destruc- tion of the bodies of the vertebrae, followed by a sharp projection backwards of their spinous processes, is (on account of the small size and depth from the surface of the spines of the cervical vertebrae) never so marked a symptom in the neck as it is in cases where the dorsal region of the column is involved. Paralysis of the spinal cord from pressure upon its substance or from inflammatory changes set up in its membranes (pachy- meningitis) may attend this form of curvature, though as a general rule it is not present (304). 308. 2. General Boioing, or arching backwards, of the spine is sometimes seen in children, the subjects of rickets, owing to simple relaxation of the ligaments and muscles connecting together and supporting the bodies of the vertebrae. The lower portion of the cervical spine is usually involved in the general or diffused curve, which is of a very different character to the sharp angular projection associated with disease of the bodies of the vertebrae; in many cases a certain amount of lateral displacement accompanies the general arching backwards. In extreme cases the bodies of the vertebrae may become somewhat compressed on the concave side of the curve. b. Spondy- In cases of spondylitis deformans (305), there is often Deformans, a general bowing or arching backwards of the cervical spine, very different to the sharp projection of angular curvature, but resembling that affection in being accom- panied by rigidity and stiffness of the neck.

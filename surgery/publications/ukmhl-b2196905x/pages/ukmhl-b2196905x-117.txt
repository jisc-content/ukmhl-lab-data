CHAPTER XI AFFECTIONS OF THE PALATE 150, Congenital fissure of tlie palate may appear in cieft-paiate. various degrees of severity, viz. 1. Simple fissure of the soft palate—when the cleft is confined to the soft palate, involving only the uvula, or, in addition, a portion or the whole of the velum palati. 2. Fissure of the soft and a part of the hard palate— when the cleft involves the whole of the soft and a portion of the hard palate. 3. Complete fissure—when the cleft involves the soft and the whole of the hard palate. In this form the alveolar margin of the jaw may be perfect, or it may present a single cleft corresponding with the line of junction of the intermaxillary and superior maxillary bones; or there may be a double cleft of the alveolar ridge corresponding with the lines of junction of the intermaxillary and superior maxillary bones, continuous jjosteriorly with a median fissure of the hard and soft palates. When the alveolar ridge of the jaw is thus involved, harelip (94) is usually associated with the cleft palate ; when the cleft in the alveolus is double, double harelip is generally present; when single, the lip is usually similarly affected, the cleft in the lip cor- responding with that in the alveolar margin, 151, Extreme arching or a dome-shaped condition of Arched j-aiaic. 7

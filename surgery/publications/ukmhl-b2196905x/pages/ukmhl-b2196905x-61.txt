41 AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE pression; the eyelids are widely separated, and cannot be closed; there is dropping of the angle of the mouth and often dribbling of saliva, while on the un- affected side, to which it appears to be drawn, its angle is raised. Articulation is often impaired, the patient is unable to blow or whistle, and mastication is interfered with, owing to the food collecting between the gum and cheek. In some cases there is perversion of taste, with slight thrusting of the tongue and pointing of the uvula to the affected side. This condition may be the result ofâ€”1. Organic mis- chief in the brain. 2. Injury or disease affecting the nei-ve in its course through the temporal bone. 3. Causes affecting the nerve after its emergence from the stylomastoid foramen, e. g. injury, pressure from tumours, exposure to cold, &c. The diagnosis of the condition on which it depends may be made by attention to the following points : 1. In cerebral disease, the muscles of the eyelid gene- rally escape, those only of the lower part of the face being affected. In all the other forms, the whole side of the face is paralysed. Hemiplegia is often present, affecting the opposite side of the body. 2. If due to disease of the temporal bone, deafness and otorrhoea are usually present. If due to fracture of the base of the skull, involving the petrous portion of the temporal bone, there will be a history and other evidences of injury (38). It is only when the nerve is implicated in its course through the temporal bone that the palate and tongue are affected. 3. If the nerve is affected after its emergence from the stylomastoid foramen, some cause of pressure is ob- vious, or there is a history of injury or exposure to cold.

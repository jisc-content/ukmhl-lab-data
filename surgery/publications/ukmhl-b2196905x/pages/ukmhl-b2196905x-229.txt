THE EAB—AFPECTIONS OP THE MIDDLE EAR 209 . . „ , , Acute Catarrh. cliildreii in the course of one of the exanthemata, and more especially in connection with scarlet fever, owing to the spread of inflammation along the Eustachian tube from the pharynx. When occurring in children its course is often very insidious, or perhaps moi*e often the symptoms are altogether overlooked, for it generally happens that the pus has made its way through the membrana tympani before the case comes under observation. 358. Chronic Catarrh of the Middle Ear is one of the Chronic Catarrh, most frequent and obstinate dtuses of deafness. It may com© on as the result of the acute disease, or gradually and insidiously without any apparent cause. In many cases it is associated with obstruction of the Eustachian tube, the result of thickening and relaxa- tion of the mucous membrane about its orifice and lining its interior (170). Accumulations of mucus, fluid in the earlier stage, somewhat inspissated ia the later, often occur in the middle ear, and owing to the obstruction to the entrance of air into its interior through the Eustachian tube, the membrana tympani becomes in many cases retracted and more drawn in than is normally the case (366). Owing to the interference with the conduction of sound through the middle ear, deafness is produced, accompanied by more or less tinnitus, often of a very distressing character. The chronic purulent catarrh of the middle ear is generally the sequel of the acute affection, where per- foration of the membrana tympani has taken place ; it is characterised by a purulent discharge (350) from the external meatus, and when it has continued for some time is often associated with the presence of a polvDus (360). 14

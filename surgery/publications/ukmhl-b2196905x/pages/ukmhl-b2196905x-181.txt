161 AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK more distinct and regular outline, with absence of lobu- lation ; their more intimate connection with the skin, which does not glide over them ; their more elastic feel, aaid, as a rule, their smaller size ; the presence in some cases, of a black speck on their surface, indicating the orifice of an obstructed hair-follicle, and through which sebaceous matter can be forced out; the absence of dimpling when the base of the tumour is compressed, though slight dimpling maybe produced when an attempt is made to raise the skin from the tumour. 270. The nape of the neck is a favourite situation for Eruption on Nape the early syphilitic eruptions, e.g. the papular and squa- mous syphilides, and in many cases the rash will be found to extend round the margin of the scalp and forehead, giving rise to the so-called " corona veneris." 271. Owing to the non-closure of the cavity of an Sinus, abscess in the neck (256), a sinus or narrow channel may result, burrowing for a considerable distance beneath the skin, discharging a thin, unhealthy, purulent fluid, and having its orifice usually concealed by a mass of projecting granulations. 272. As the result of suppuration, in or around the s^â„¢mo"s uicera- lymphatic glands in strumous subjects, ulcers are often formed of a very chronic and intractable character. They may be single, or appear in groups, and are generally somewhat irregular in shape ; their edges, on a level with the surrounding surface, or very slightly thickened, are usually much undermined, and the sur- rounding skin is congested and of a dusky or purple colour ; the surface of the ulcer is uneven and covered with large flabby granulations, which often project above the level of the skin and discharge a thin, curdy, un- healthy pus. 11

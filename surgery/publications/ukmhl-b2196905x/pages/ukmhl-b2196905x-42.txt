In Impetigo the eruption consists of numerous small pustules, grouped together in clusters, which burst and form thick scabs and incrustations, glueing together and entangling the hair. In many cases the eruption is accompanied by enlargement of the cervical glands, and appears to be due to the irritation caused by the presence of pediculi. The connection between eczema and impetigo is a very close one, and by some impetigo is regarded as a pus- tular form of eczema. A combination of the two affections is not at all uncommon, the pustules of the former being often present along with the vesicles of the latter. In Pityriasis the scalp is covered by an increased formation of very fine epidermic scales, like those of bran, which are readily rubbed off and fall in the form of scurf or fine powder. There is no thickening or apparent inflammation of the cutis, as in psoriasis, and the affection is of an entirely superficial cha- racter. In Psoriasis the skin, which is somewhat thickened and inflamed, is covered with raised patches of dry white epidermic scales. It is distinguished from eczema, with which it is somewhat liable to be confounded, by the fact that the thickened patches are simply made up of proliferating epidermic scales, and not of dried-up secretion, as is the case in that affection.

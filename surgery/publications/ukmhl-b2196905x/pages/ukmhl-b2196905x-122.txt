CHAPTER XII AFFECTIONS OF THE GUMS 160. Hypertrophy of the Crum, or a simple outgrowth of gum-tissue alone, is sometimes seen, presenting itself as a more or less pedunculated, red, fleshy, polypoid growth, often projecting above and overlapping the crowns of the teeth. This condition is usually asso- ciated with uncleanly habits, or may be due to the irritation of carious teeth. 161. The gums, especially in the neighbourhood of the front teeth, are not uncommonly the seat of vascular or ncevoid growths, generally of small size, often more or less pedunculated, and readily bleeding upon manipula- tion. 162. The term Epulis {kin, upon, ovXov, the gum) is sometimes applied to any tumour situated upon the gum, but strictly speaking it should be confined to the more or less purely fibrous tumour that arises from the surface of the alveolar process, and which is in many cases connected with the periosteum, lining membrane of the alveolus, and fibrous tissue of the gum. The simple epulis is a purely fibrous tumour; in some cases, however, round and spindle (sarcomatous) cells are found mixed with imperfectly formed fibrous tissue, or myeloid cells may be present as well, and may constitute the greater portion of the growth. The purely fibrous epulis shows no tendency to return

Tinnitus Tinnitus is always an important symptom in making a diagnosis as to the cause of deafness, for it is present in a great variety of affections, alike of the external, middle, and internal ear. "Any condition which produces pressure on the labyrinth or tympanic membrane may give rise to this symptom. A piece of cerumen lying in contact with the membrane is a familiar example or one, and some cases of Eustachian obstruction of the other. " In this latter instance, the pressure of air on the external surface of the membrane being greater than on the internal, the membrane is retracted, in its turn the handle of the malleus is drawn inwards, and the stapes in this way is unduly pressed on the fenestra ovalis. " When the cerumen is removed in the one case, and the tympanum inflated in the other, in the immediate disappearance of tinnitus we recognise cause and effect, and are able to explain the phenomenon, " If in cases of catarrh of the middle ear the tinnitus does not disappear after inflation of the tympanum, it is in all probability due either to a partial or complete anchylosis in some part of the chain of ossicles, or else is dependent on causes situated in the labyrinth. " As a rule, when it is dependent on pressure due either to disease of the middle ear, to impacted ceru- men, or foreign bodies in the meatus, it is not of that aggravated character which it assumes when its origin must be sought for in the deeper structure. " With persons in whom there is no evidence what- ever of catarrh, either from the history or from ca.reful examination of the middle ear, in whom the deafness

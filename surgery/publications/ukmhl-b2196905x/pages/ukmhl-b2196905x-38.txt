REGIONAL STTEGEEY 18 anterior fontanelle, and producing more or less distinct prominences in this situation, occurring in young children the subjects of congenital syphilis, usually ■within the first two years of life, are due to syphilitic osteitis, the substance of the bone itself being involved, as well as that of the periosteum covering it. In many cases there are four of these little bosses or prominences round the anterior fontanelle, separated from one another by the coronal and sagittal sutures. From the supposed resemblance to the " nates," the term " natiform eminences" is sometimes applied to the little elevations or thickenings of the bones of the skull produced in this way. The thickenings of the frontal bone continuing may, at a later period of life, produce the peculiar and cha- racteristic protuberance of the frontal eminences, which is so diagnostic of hereditary syphilis (47).* Craniotabes. 29. Abnormal softening of portions of the occipital and parietal bones, causing them to yield to moderate pressure and impart to a finger pressed upon them a sensation like that derived from stif£ parchment or from the surface of a bladder, is craniotahes, or extreme thinning, followed in some cases by perforation of the bones of the skull, the result of the pressure of the brain and the counter-pressure of the pillow upon the softened and spongy osseous tissue. This condition is sometimes found in young children the subjects of rickets, but by some it is looked upon as an evidence of congenital syphilis.f iiodeni Ulcer. 30. The scalp is sometimes the seat of rodent ulcer, the general appearance of which is described in Table (44). * Parrot, ' Brit. Med. Journal,' vol. i, p. 789, 429. t Ibid.

AFFECTIONS OF THE EYELIDS 127 or displacement of the eyelashes, the result generally of contraction of the palpebral conjunctiva in cases of granular lids ; owing to the friction of the eyelashes against the globe, its anterior surface becomes irritated and the seat of chronic inflammatory changes. This condition is generally found to be present in cases of entropion (212). The term distichiasis is applied when the eyelashes are so displaced that they are arranged in a double row. 215. Fistulous Openings, discharging a clearish or Lachrymal Fis- muco-purulent fluid, are sometimes seen in the outer portion of the upper eyelid communicating with the lachrymal gland (220), or in the neighbourhood of the inner canthus leading down to the lachrymal sac (223). 216. Ptosis, or drooping of the upper eyelid, may be ^iobib. due to several causes, viz.: JL. Paralysis of the third nerve or that branch of it which supplies the levator palpebrse. 2. Direct injury, e. g. a blow on the upper eyelid, or a wound involving the levator palpebrse. 3. Some congenital defect, e. y. non-development of the levator palpebrae. 4. In old subjects a slight degree of drooping of the upper eyelid is sometimes seen, apparently the result of simple relaxation and redundancy of integument. 217. The muscles of the eyelids, orbicularis, and ^'^^'^3°°^ , levator palpebrae, may become the seat of spasmodic or ^'''s- paralytic affections. 1. Paralysis of levator palpehrcs, causing drooping of Levator the upper eyelid or ptosis (216), is generally the result i"'''"''"*- of paralysis of the third nerve, or of that branch of it which supplies the muscle. 2.

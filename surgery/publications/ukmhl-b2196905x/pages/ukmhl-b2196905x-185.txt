CHAPTEE XX INJURIES OF THE NECK 278. Wotmds of the Throat are, in tlie majority of Wounds cases, of suicidal origin; tliey may be divided into two great classes, viz.: Superficial, involving tlie skin alo?ie, or skin and superficial structures. Deep, involving the large blood-vessels, pharynx, ceso- pbagus, or some portion of the air-passages, e.g. larynx or trachea. In some cases, all the soft parts may be divided down to the spinal column, and when the wound is situated at the back of the neck, the cord itseK and its membranes may be divided ; under these cir- cumstances the symptoms will be very similar to those accompanying fracture of the spine with compression of the cord (303). If in front, the wound may be situated as follows : 1. Above the hyoid bone, involving the floor of the mouth and dividing the base of the tongue ; wounds in this situation are often accompanied by considerable haemorrhage from injury to the lingual artery, and if the tongue is completely divided, its base may fall back over the orifice of the larynx and produce death from suffocation. 2. Through the thyro-hyoid membrane, dividing the epiglottis or tips of the arytenoid cartilages; these structures, if they fall back into the larynx, may offer considerable obstruction to respiration, or, setting up severe spasm, may cause death from suffocation.

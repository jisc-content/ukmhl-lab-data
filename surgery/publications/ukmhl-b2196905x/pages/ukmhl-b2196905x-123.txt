AFFECTIONS OF THE GUMS 103 after complete removal, but in those cases where there is a combination of round, spindle, or myeloid cells, with imperfectly formed fibrous tissue, local recurrence is very liable to take place. An epulis usually appears as a small, lobulated, fleshy outgrowth of the gum, in the immediate neigh- bourhood of or surrounding the teeth, which often pro- ject through it. It generally has a broad base, is of firm or semi-elastic consistence, growing slowly, and at times slightly ulcerating on the surface. 163. Epithelioma, or " malignant epulis," as it is Epithelioma, sometimes termed, may attack the gum, and is to be Epuiu." recognised by the indurated, everted edges and irregular, ulcerated surface of the growth, which is often some- what excavated, and at times very vascular, bleeding readily. Enlargement of the glands beneath the jaw is soon produced, and the disease, which is often attended by considerable pain, generally occurs at a later period of life than the simple epulis just described (162). 164. Mercurial Stomatitis is characterised by redness Mercurial stomn- and swelling of the gums, which feel tender and bleed readily. There is a disagreeable fcetor of the breath with profuse secretion of saliva, and the patient expe- riences a peculiar metallic taste. After a time ulcera- tion occurs along the margin of the gums; sloughing of their surface ensues, the teeth become loosened and fall out, and in extreme cases necrosis of the alveolar margin of the jaw may ensue. 165. In Chronic Lead-poisoning, a peculiar blue line in Lead-poiaon- is produced at the junction of the gums and teeth, and the latter, if not cleansed, become coated with a blackish incrustation and show a tendency to decay. The other symptoms of lead-poisoning will be pro- bably present, e.g. intestinal colic, muscular tremors.

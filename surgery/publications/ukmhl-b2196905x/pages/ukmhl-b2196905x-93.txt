AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS 73 ing, is generally surrouBded by a large mass of spongy bone poured out by tbe neighbouring periosteum. The necrosis which follows the eruptive fevers (scarlet fever, measles, &c.) is probably due to a similar cause, viz. the access of a specific poison to the bone through the sockets of the teeth; it is generally limited to the alveolar margin, the body of the jaw as a rule escaping. 113. Fracture of the upper jaw may involve either ^^j^^^™-^ of Upper the body or alveolar margin and hard palate ; the injury is often complicated with laceration of the face, and when the alveolus is involved, there will be loosening and more or less displacement of the teeth. When the anterior wall of the antrum is driven in, considerable deformity may remain, owing to the difiiculty of replac- ing the depressed fragments, and emphysema (68) is often present. 114. Enlargement or Expansion of the Lower Jaw may ^ ^xpSn' of be due to— the Lo« er Jaw. 1. New growths, e. g. different forms of tumours (115). 2. Simple Inflammatory Affections, e.g.: a. Acute periostitis (118). ^. Chronic periostitis (118). y. Necrosis of the body of the jaw, where the seques- tmm or dead portion of bone is surrounded by a greatly thickened case of new bone (112). 8. Alveolar abscess, in connection with carious teeth, when the pus, not finding an outlet, burrows between the bone and periosteum, or forms a diffused swelling beneath the tissues of the gum (111). c. Excessive formation of callus after fracture, in cases where the fragments have not been kept at rest (120).

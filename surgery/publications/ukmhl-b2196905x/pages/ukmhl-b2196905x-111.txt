91 AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE Vlceraiion. the same affection attacking the lip, it is much more common in males than females. Any part of . the tongue may be attacked, but its margins, towards the middle or posterior part, suffer much more frequently than the dorsum or anterior portion. In the following table the main points of distinction between this affection and the deep syphilitic ulcer, with which it is very liable to be confounded, are laid down. 136. Differential Diagnosis of Epithelioma and Deep SypMlitio Ulcer. Cause Age Situation Shape Base Edges Course Floor of mouth Epithelioma. Often due to some local irritation, e.g. rough or carious teeth; smoking a clay pipe Generally over 40 years Most commonly at one side, towards middle or posterior third Irregular Foul and sloughy; rough and irregular, with well-marked and wide- spread induration Raised, everted, thick- ened, and indurated Ulceration primary, the induration about base being secondary to the ulceration Becomes involved, so that tongue after a time is tied down,fixed, immovable, and incap- able of being protruded from the mouth Syphilitic Ulcer. Due to breaking down of a gummatous deposit, not to any local irrita- tion. Generally under 40 yrs. Often in median line, towards middle or pos- terior surface of dor- sum. Oval or round. Deeply excavated; much less induration; often covered with a " wash- leather" slough. Rugged and irregular; often sharply cut. Ulceration secondary, i.e. the induration (viz. the gumma) breaks down and ulcerates. Not involved, so that tongue is freely mova- ble and capable of be- ing protruded from the mouth.

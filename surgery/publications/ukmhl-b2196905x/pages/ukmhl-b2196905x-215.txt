CHAPTEE XXIII THE BAB Affections of the Auricle 328. Malformations of the Auricle, or external ear, are Malformation, sometimes seen. Complete absence or imperfect development of the auricle is occasionally met with, and in many cases these conditions are associated with defect or absence of the external auditory canal. Supernumerary auricles are sometimes found, situated on the cheek or side of the neck, and at times this deformity is associated with macrostoma or congenital fissure of the cheek (94). Congenital fistulce, the result of non-closure of the first visceral cleft, are rarely found, opening just in front of the tragus and extending for a variable dis- tance, sometimes as far as the tympanic cavity; in some cases the external opening is situated on the helix. Associated with these congenital fistulse we sometimes find supernumerary auricles, or the external ear may be imperfectly developed; in some cases, similar openings are found at the side of the neck (276). Absence of some portion, or of the whole, of the awnci^e Absence, may be due to a congenital arrest of development, or it may be the result of injury or of disease, e.g. epithe- lioma, lupus, rodent ulcer, syphilitic ulceration (335).

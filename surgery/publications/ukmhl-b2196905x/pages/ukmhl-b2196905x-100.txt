CHAPTEE VIII AFFECTIONS OF THE TEETH ^yphfus"''^ 123. Children, or young adults, the subjects of con- genital syphilis, often present a peculiar malformation of the permanent teeth, most marked in the incisors, especially the central ones of the upper jaw, the shape, size, and direction of which are in many cases consider- ably altered. In typical cases, the central upper incisors present a vertical notch, usually of crescentic shape, on their cutting edge; their lateral borders are bounded by curved outlines, the convexities of which look outwards, and their cutting edge is narrower than their neck, just the reverse of what is found in the normal state.* At * The characteristic notch present on the cutting edge of the central upper incisors in congenital syphilis must not be confounded with the notches or serrations often normally present in the teeth of young subjects, which vary in number and degree. Not un- commonly, the central upper incisors show three little projections or denticles, separated by two little notches (or there may be four projections and three notches). The lateral incisors, on the other hand, often present " a single central notch, one which, if it occurred in the central incisors, might easily lead to the suspicion of syphilis." Â« The malformation peculiar to syphilis is caused by the non- development of the central denticle in the three-toothed upper central incisor; this leaves a gap in the middle and allows the lateral denticles to fall together, thus producing the characteristic shape."

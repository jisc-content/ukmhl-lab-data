AFFECTIONS OF SCALP AND TAULT OF CRANIUM 23 p^^^^^^,,^ jp,, lions. tlie course of tlie frontal nerves, is an instance of Rerpes zoster or " Shingles" (H. frontalis). Along with other symptoms of constitutional syphi- ^'"P^^^'^^ 'yp^'"^- lis, and most commonly during the earlier stage, the hair of the scalp, becoming dry and withered, comes away ia large quantities, and leaves the patient more or less completely bald. Pityriasis is often present at the same time, the shedding of the hair being often accompanied by superficial desquamation of the epidermis. In Tinea tonsurans, or ringworm, there are round or Tinea tonsurans Â° -J OY Kingworm. oval, slightly elevated patches on the scalp, covered with fine white scales, upon which the hairs, rendered dry and brittle by the invasion of the fungus, have been broken off close to the skin. The patches tend to increase in size, spreading at their circumference, and in some cases reach consider- able dimensions. The disease, which is usually found in children, is due to the presence of a vegetable parasite, the TricopJiyton tonsttrans, the spores and tubes of which will be seen if the scales or hairs are examined tmder the microscope. In Tinea favosa portions of the scalp are covered with ^inea favosa, small, yellow, cup-shaped crusts, each of which contains a hair in its centre. As the disease progresses the crusts, increasing in size and becoming confluent, pro- duce large, irregular, thickened yellowish masses, which on their removal leave somewhat ulcerated sur- faces. In some cases a peculiar offensive odour is per- ceived, like that of mice or cat's urine. This affection, which is most common in children, is only occasionally met with in this country; it is due to the presence of a vegetable parasite, Achorion Schonleinii, and if the yel- low scabs or crusts are examined microscopically they

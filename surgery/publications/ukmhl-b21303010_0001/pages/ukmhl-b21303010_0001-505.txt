LIGATURE OP ARTERIES. 475 Such a case as this is unique, and deserves a place in the records of our profession. I’lG. 149. neri^e "^^-^Omc-hi/cld masctf ^\jCarctid \^r££ry (This figure, with many others in tliis chapter, is based upon those given in Sedillot’s work.) With respect to the prognosis after this operation, much depends Prognosis of on the object for which it is performed. Dr. Pilz, of Breslau, whose ligaturing in statistics ai’e the most recent (‘ Langenbeck’s Archives,’ 1868), makes out that 43 out of every 100 die. He says that of 228 cases in which the operation was performed for hmmorrhage, 128, or 56 per cent., were fatal; of 87 for aneurism, 31, or 35 per cent., diedj of 142 for tumours, 49, or 34 per cent., died ; of 71 for extirpations, 25 died, or nearly 34 per cent.: of 34 for affections of the nervous system, only one died, or 3 per cent.; and of 38 for aneurism, on the distal or Brasdor’s method, 25 died, or 65 per cent. Secondary haemorrhage is a common cause of death, but brain com- plications are the more frequent—abscess in the brain and atrophic softening from want of arterial supply being the usual form—local gangrene, as it were, of the brain. Brain symptoms in some of their forms also occur frequently after tne operation, when death does not take place simply from altered cerebral circulation. Suppuration of the aneurismal sac is not unfrequent j and in a case of my own it was the cause of death.

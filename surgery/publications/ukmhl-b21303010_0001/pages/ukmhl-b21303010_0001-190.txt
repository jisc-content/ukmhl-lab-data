160 diseases and cicatrices. Cancer may attack scars, Examples. Painful cicatrices. subcutaneous areolar tissue, and often going on to produce sucb a contraction of the part affected as to resemble the indurated cicatrix of a burn. Figs. 43, 44 represent the two affections. The cheloid tumour which follows the perforation of the ear for an ear-ring is a curious form, and seems less liable to return than others of a like nature; and from the deformity it causes it should be excised with a portion of the healthy lobule. Cancer may attack a scar, but when it does so the scars are generally old. Thus, I have treated a man who had a cancerous lip, the disease having developed in a scar he had had for fifty years. It began as a thickening of the scar, and then showed itself as a tubercle, which grew, broke down, and ulcerated, the ulceration rapidly spread- ing. Cancers in cicatrices mostly appear after this fashion, are usually epithelial, and are to be treated by the removal of the growth. Eig. 43. Fig. 44. (From models in Guyâ€™s Museum.) Cheloid of Alibert. Cheloid of Addison. In December, 1871,1 was called upon to amputate above the knee in a man, mt. 58, a leg stump that was the seat of a frightful cancerous disease which had existed for two years, and had appeared in the cicatrix of an old amputation performed fifty-four years before for gangrene after fever (Fig- 25). Pninfnl cicatrices are often due to tbe divided ends of the nerves being bound in by the cicatricial tissue, and as often as not they are caused by a bound-down bulbous growth at the extremity of a nerve. In a case I had some years ago the external popliteal nerve, as it wound round the head of the fibula, was so bound down by the cicatrix of a burn as to cause severe agony in the whole course of its distribu- tion. The symptoms were relieved by two free verticalincisions tbroug the cicatrix, and the patient recovered. Should I ever see a similar case 1 shall pursue the same course, except that I shall subsequently transp pieces of skin in the wounds as soon as they assume a healthy appearance.

To cut the corner of the nail, under the idea that it is the offending body, is a futile proceeding; it may for the moment appear to be of service, but, in the end, it is injurious; indeed, the nail should be left square, as nature made it, and care should he taken to see that the soft parts are in no way pressed over its edge. Onychia maligna. This is a disease of the nail matrix, and a far more severe and On onychia obstinate affection than the last. It is found most commonly in maligna, nnhealthy children, and, as a rule, is started by some local injury, children.^ such as a squeeze. It commences as a swelling of the end of the toe or finger, with the other external signs of infiammation—redness, heat, and pain. These symptoms are soon followed by the exudation from beneath the nail of a serous fluid, which is often foetid; the nail itself loosens, sometimes falls off, or either flattens out or curls up at its edges (Fig. 53). When this occurs, a foul ulcer is visible beneath. In extreme cases the affected parts assume a flattened bulbous form, and look as incurable as any local affection can well appear, and, in rare instances, the disease involves the last phalangeal joint or bone. It is never found in other than feeble and cachectic children. The worst case I have seen of this nature occurred in a child, at. 10, in whom the fingers and thumbs of both hands were involved, and had existed for years.

OPERATIONS ON THE EYELIDS. 341. cartilage. Tbe raw surface should then be wiped with a sponge, and any black dots denoting the presence of hair-bulbs carefully removed. Compressorium forceps. Compressorium forceps applied. Entropion. From spas- modic con- traction of orbicularis. From dis- tortion of tarsal cartilage. The compressorium forceps should then be unscrewed, when sharpUi bmraorrhage will take place. The eye must be covered by two piecis of wet lint secured by a turn of bandage. Entropion signifies a rolling inwards of the whole lid, the whob row of lashes being completely turned towards the eyeball; it is mo4 frequently met with in the lower lid, more especially in old peopb with a superabundance of loose skin about the face. It is often tie cause of much trouble and annoyance, as well as of danger to the eye after cataract e.\traction. The inversion may be caused either by spasmodic contraction of the orbicularis muscle or by distortion and thickening of the tarsal car- tilage after granular ophthalmia. Entropion caused by contraction of the orbicularis is easily remedied as follows:â€”The patient, lying on a couch {see Fig. 94, p. 340), the operator should seize with forceps the skin of the lid at a point near one or other cauthus, about two lines from its margin, and then with scissors remove a portion in breadth corresponding to about half the surface of the lid, and extending along its whole length; he should then seize and remove the orbicularis muscle to a corresponding extent; no suture need be used; the eye should be bound up with wet lint and a bandage. The subsequent healing of the wound and contraction of the cicatrix will remedy the inversion. Entropion depending on distortion and thickening of the tarsal c.ar- tilage is usually met with in the upper lid. It can be remedied by removal of a wedge-shaped piece of cartilage, including the more Fig. 95. Compresso- rium forceps. Fig. 96.

728 EECTAL MEDICATION. Milk and eggs, alternating witli one of meat juice and pancreas, seems to be preferable. As a meat emulsion, Kaufmann’s mixture is excellent, composed of a pound of minced beef, a third of a pound of fresh pancreas, and half a pint of cold water. The whole allowed to macerate for three quarters of an hour, gradually raised to the boiling point, and boiled for two minutes. The mixture will then have been reduced to the con- sistence of a thick soup. When this mixture is not at hand, good beef tea or mutton broth may be employed, to which Liebig’s extract of meat may be added. In making beef tea or broth, long boiling does no good. A pound of finely-minced meat macerated in half a pint of cold water for three or four hours will give an excellent mixture; and, if the whole is well shaken for half an hour, nearly the same result is obtained. Rectal medication in its way is as valuable as alimentation, more particularly when morphia, opium, or mercury is prescribed. The former drugs administered after an operation before the influence of the ansesthetic has passed off, doing more to calm the patient and give rest than any other method, more particularly in cases of abdominal surgery. The latter employed twice a day acting on syphilitic patients in such a quiet and beneficial way as to lead me to look upon it as the best method of bringing any one under its influence.

The blood is not modified as regards its fibrine, globules, gas, temperature, or density; it passes from one system to another with all its primitive vitality, and continues to live on.” Not more than six to nine ounces of blood should be transfused at one time, the injection too should be gradual, that is, about six syringofuls a minute. DISEASES OF THE AETERIES. Arteritis.—Under this heading, besides the rarer forms of disease, we shall include atheroma, as there is no longer any question of its inflammatory nature. Of this, Virchow, Billroth, Wilks, and Moxon, have given sufficient evidence, though in modern text-books the old view is still taught, and the weight of Gulliver’s investigations (‘ Med.- Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xxvi) has not yet lost its influence. We by no means think that Gulliver was altogether in error in holding that atheroma was a fatty and calcareous degeneration of the inner and middle arterial coats with subsequent thickening of the adventitia; on the contrary, it is not improbable that atheroma may sometimes be a simple retrograde metamorphosis of the arterial tissues; but, there can be no doubt that it more often begins as a sub-inflammatory pro- On arteritis and atheroma.

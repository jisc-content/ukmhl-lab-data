TREATMENT OP N^VTJS. 466 Within the last few years I have successfully treated many of the mixed varieties of nmvi with the galvanic cautery, by simply per- forating them with the heated needle in many points (ignipunc- ture). dfffuaednEevi treatment of a diffused najvus by means of setons is a practice ae naevi. strongly recommended. Several setons steeped in the solution of the perchloride of iron are often sufficient to coagulate the blood or to set up enough inflammatory action to cure the growth.

In nsevi involving the eyelids this suggestion is of value, and, in my own practice, several instances of cure have followed the application of a ligature to half the growth. In a mixed na3vus of moderate size when the cnre by ligature is to be carried out, a pin may be passed beneath the grouiih, and also a needle at right angles to the pin, armed with a double ligature (Fig. 144a). The nmvus is then strangled in halves by the ligatures tightly drawn beneath the pin ; but before the ligatures are Anally tightened it is well to puncture it to let out the serum and blood, to relieve tension, aud to allow of the more perfect strangulation of the growth. When this act is completed the pin may generally be removed. Small nsevi may be vaccinated, although the chances of a cure by such means are very small. The same also must be said for compression.

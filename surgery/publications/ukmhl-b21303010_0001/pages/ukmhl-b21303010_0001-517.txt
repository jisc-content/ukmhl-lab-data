LIGATURE OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 485 cision he practised was vertical in the course of the artery, begin- ning an inch above Poupart’s ligament. The peritoneum, however, is too much disturbed by this proceeding, as well as the abdominal walls weakened. The best incision is that employed by Sir A. Cooper, a slightly curved one, about half an inch above Poupart’s ligament, and to the inner side of its centre, curving upwards and outwards for about three inches towards the anterior superior spine of the ilium. (Pig. 156.) This incision should divide all the soft parts superficial to the external oblique muscle. All vessels that are divided should be secured. Fig.156. Ligature of external iliac and superficial femoral arteries. The tendon of the external oblique muscle should then be divided the whole length of the skin wound, togetlier with the internal oblique and trausversalis muscle when they cannot be drawn outwards, and care should he taken not to injure the peritoneum; the cord .Modern incision, and description of the operation.

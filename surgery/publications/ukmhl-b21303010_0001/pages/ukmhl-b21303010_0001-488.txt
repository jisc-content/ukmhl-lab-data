(4) That a ruptured artery in parts less fascia-bound than the leg;: (as, for instance, the arm) may be treated more as in the case of injuries to arteries by the application of a ligature to the wounded vessel. When an artery is obstructed, the circulation is carried on by what is Fig. 136. Fig. 137. Anterior view. Posterior view. bruuclics of the profunda.

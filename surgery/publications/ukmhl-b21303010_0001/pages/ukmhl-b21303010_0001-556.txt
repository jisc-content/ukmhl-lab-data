AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE. 524 i 1 Treatment of cancer of tongue. I ■i ! ,, Caustics, 'j Ligature. |i i Excision. I Treatment.—It is now admitted that the sooner the disease is removed the better, as there seems good reason to believe that it is at first a local affection, and that after its removal a cure may be ob- tained. If this end he not secured, much benefit will be gained by the operation, as it relieves a patient for a time, from a most distressing and exhausting affection; and, should a return take place, it is more likely to do so in the glands than in the part—while death, under these circumstances, is less painful. The operation, moreover, is attended with marvellously little risk to life, and is followed by improved articu- lation even when the whole organ has been removed. In the case figured (Fig. 195) the man could speak as well after as before the operation. There are only two modes by which this removal should be effected, excision and the ecraseur. Caustics are painful and uncertain, consequently have been rightly abandoned. The ligature is painful and tedious, and, beyond the freedom from haemorrhage, it has no advantages ; and in this is only equal to the ecraseur. In excision the surgeon using knife or scissors must be careful to remove the whole of the diseased part, cutting weU beyond the limits of the tumour. At the same time, when a portion of the organ only need be sacrificed, no more should be removed than necessary. It is wiser, however, to remove too much than too little. Fig. 194. Tongue forceps.

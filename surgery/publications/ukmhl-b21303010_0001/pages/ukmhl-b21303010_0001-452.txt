422 HiEMOREHAGE AND ITS TREATMENT. Arguments in favour of torsion. Statistics of torsion. The artery constrictor. How it acts. The physiological arguments in favour of torsion are numerous,] while the practical advantages seem to be not less. After nine years’ experience of the practice among vessels of all sizes (the femoral being ] the largest) I have had no mishap. I have further observed, that wounds] have united more rapidly and kindly—primary union being the rule ;1 there has been less constitutional disturbance after operation and] consequently less liability to traumatic fever, pysemia, and other com-j plications such as we are all too familiar with, in the practice of surgery.^ Stumps have healed in a week, and patients been up in two weeks,! without one single drawback, rapid and uninterrupted convalescence] following the operation. In other cases, equally good success can be] recorded. At Guy’s Hospital we have had two hundred consecutive] cases of amputation of the thigh, leg, arm, and forearm, in all which] the arteries had been twisted (110 of them having been of the femoral] artery) and no case of secondary hasmorrhage. The Artery Constrictor. Dr. Fleet Speir, of Brooklyn, New York, has had an artery constricto^ Fig. 123. 1. Au artery taken up by the constrictor. 2.

Effects made (Fig. 123) which, as he has demonstrated upon both the living! and the dead, has the power of dividing the inner coats of an artery and I allowing them to recurve, as in torsion. He has used it on *iU tlie_j larger vessels except the iliac and subclavian, and has never had any, trouble, union chiefly by first intention having followed ( Med.

PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION. In presenting to my professional brethren the Third Edition of a book which has been so kindly received as this, I have only to express a hope that it will not pi’ove less acceptable than its predecessors. The whole has been carefully revised, much of it has been re-wiatten, important additions have been made to almost every chapter, and, of the six hundred and seventy-two woodcuts, eighty-eight are new, and many colom’ed.

655 ABDOMINAL HERNIA. tissues is often very marked, the degree of congestion depending upon the intensity of the strangulation. When, however, the strangulation has been acute or of long standing, and an inflammatory action been added to that of congestion, the mation. bowel will not only be swollen but soft, the natural glistening aspect and elasticity of its coats having become changed for a dull appear- ance and leathery condition. Its serous surface may indeed be covered with a layer or with flocculi of lymph, or the knuckle of intes- tine may be wholly or in part soft and gangrenous, with ash-coloured spots on its surface, and even perforations.

ILt At the neck of the sac other changes will also be found, and these changes at depend materially upon the character and seat of the constricting neck of sac. force. Thus, when the line of a strangulation is rigid and linear, as it is in direct inguinal and femoral hernia, the knuckle of strangulated bowel, either as a whole or in part, may be rapidly destroyed by gangrene. And when the pressure is more diffused and less rapid. Ulceration of as in large inguinal hernia, ulceration of the mucous membrane at the mucous line of stricture, even to perforation, is more common—the grooved or “>*mbrane. sulcated condition of the serous surface in the line of stricture being found in both. Within the abdomen every indication of peritonitis from the mere Peritonitis, tj greasy condition of peritoneum to fibrinous or even suppurative effu- I sion may be met with. In most cases local peritonitis will be found about the seat of hernia, and in some the peritonitis will be general, w The strangulated portion of bowel will almost always be found at the 1.

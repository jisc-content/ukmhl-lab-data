Tumours of auricle. Cheloid tuoioursv 1 AFFECTIONS OF THE EXTERNAL EAE. ulceration of the external ear some years previously. The condition of the ear is indicated in the accompanying engraving (Fig. 109). By paring the edges of the pendulous portions of the auricle, and the skin covering over the parts behind, a good-looking entire ear was made with great addition to her comfort. The tumours of which the auricle may he the seat are the othse- matous, gouty, fihro-plastic, fihro-cartilaginous, sebaceous, erectile, epitheliomatous, and sarcomatous. The fihro-plastic or cheloid has been already alluded to as occurring in the lohulusof the ear after the operation of puncture. I have seen many such, the largest having been the size of a walnut (Fig. 110). They generally do well after excision, hut if not thoroughly removed will grow again. The othsematomatous requires special mention, but the others are to be recognised and treated as in other,parts of the body. Report by Dr. Goodhart on Cheloid Tumours of the Dar. The small tumours or thickenings of the skin which usually go by the name of cheloid (Alibert) are of infiammatory nature, with more or lessj Fig. no. I'm. 111. Cheloid tumour of ear.

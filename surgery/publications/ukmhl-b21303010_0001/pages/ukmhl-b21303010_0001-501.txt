LIGATURE OP ABDOMINAL AORTA. 471 I believe, nevertheless, the operation of placing a ligature upon the abdominal aorta to he justifiable under exceptional circumstances, such Pig. 148.

The hit incision by which to reach the abdominal aorta is the indirect, a modifittion of that adopted by Sir P. Crampton in the case of the common liac artery (Fig. 148), viz., one extending from the anterior superior pinous process of the ilium of the left side to the cartilage of the tei.h rib, the peritoneum being reflected. The great difficulty in this oeration is in the application of the ligature to the vessel. The bestfircc^ incision is through the abdominal walls on the vessel such as isDractised by Dr. Watson. Ligature of the Arteria Innominata. On ligature of the arteria The firsoperat'on was by V. Mott, of New York, in 1818, and since innominata. then this Jtery has been tied twelve times, but only once with success (by Dr. Smth, of New Orleans, in 1864) and in that case the carotid and vertebral iteries were likewise ligatured, the former at the same time as the innainata, the latter a month af terw’ards for secondary haemor- rhage. D Smyth accomplished this on the suggestion made by Mott in 1818, wm he wrote, “ by thus intercepting the retrograde current through thprimitive carotid there would be less chance of any reflux haemorrbap in the event of a phagmdenic ulceration taking place in the wound. In all the other cases a fatal result rapidly ensued. It can only b entertained, therefore, in cases of injury to the carotid or subclavh near their origin, or in exceptional cases of disease. When deciid on, the operation should be proceeded with as follows—

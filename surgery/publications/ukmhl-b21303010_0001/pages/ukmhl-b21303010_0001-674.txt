642 ABDOMINAL HERNIA. CHAPTER XV. HERNIA. Fig. 2C1. Fig. 262. Diagrams illustrating the different forms of Hernia, with some of its complications. In all these diagrams the thick black line represents the parietes covering in the hernial saej the thin line the peri- toneum and hernial sac; the small body at the bottom of the sac the testicle. Fig. 261.—This diagram illustrates the tubular vaginal process of peritoneum open down to the testicle, into which a hernia may descend. When the descent occurs at birth the hernia is called “con- genital when at a later period of life the “congenital form,” Birkett’s “ hernia into the vaginal process of peritoneum,” or Malgaigne’s “hernia of infancy.” Fig. 262.—The same process of peritoneum open half way down the cord, into which a hernia may descend at birth or at a later period. Birkett’s “hernia into the funicular portion of the vaginal process of the peritoneum.” Fig. 263.—The same process undergoing natural contraction above the testicle, explaining the hour- glass contraction met with in the congenital form of scrotal hernia as well as in hydrocele. Fig. 264.—Diagram showing the formation of the “acquired congenital form of hernia,” the “encysted of Sir A. Cooper,” “the infantile of Hey,” the acquired hernial sac being pushed into the open tunica vaginalis which encloses it.

444 ANEURISM. Hosp. Rep.’ for 1869, a patient ajt. 32 cured himself of a popliteal aneurism by pressure in four and a half hours. In one more recent a man mt. 40 cured himself in eighteen hours, after flexion and pro- longed surgical treatment hy instrumental pressure had utterly failed. M. Vanzetti, in 1855, records another in which digital compression cured a popliteal aneurism in four hours. When digital pressure can he employed and is successful, it is more rapid than any other, and as a rule less painful. It can also he used where instrumental pressure is inapplicable, as in the case of the carotid. In fact, when admissible, it should always be primarily employed in pre- Instrumeutal ference toany other form of treatment. When digital compression cannot pressure. jg applied, the next best is instrumental pressure, and for this purpose Fig. 131. Use of weight. ^Mode of appiyins pressure to the femoral artery for the cure of aneurism, there is nothing equal to a conical weight of lead (Fig. 131 a) covered with leather and perforated with an iron axle (b), upon which extra pieces of lead (c) can be dropped (Bellingham’s Method); the weights being so adiusted as to arrest the circulation through the artery and no more. This weight can be slung to a cradle placed over the limb, held by an assistant, or left to the intelligent patient. It can be shifted gently from one spot to another when pressure causes pain, antt is far less painful than any other instrument. In popliteal aneurism, the weight maybe adjusted to the upper part of the groin, and it is an excellent plan to apply a semicircular tourniquet lower down, by n bicn

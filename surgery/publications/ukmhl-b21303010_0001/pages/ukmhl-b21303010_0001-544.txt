When removed, tile maxillary bones subsequently approximate, and the lateral in- cisorteeth frequently assume the posi- tion of the central. Sir W. Fergusson latterly removed these bones, or the milk tooth with its bony bed, subcu- taneously, and, I think, with advan- tage. When they are pushed so for- ward as to form a kind of appendage to the tip of the nose, as seen in Fig. 180, they ought to be removed. The portion of skin over the bones, however, must always be utilised, either to form a columna nasi where none existed, as in Figs. 181 and 182, or, to be brought down, and inserted between the two lateral por- tions of the lip. Wlien primary union fails, the surgeon can often succeed by scrap- ing the surface of the wound and re-applying the sutures; and he may do this, although tbe parts have sloughed at first as soon as healthy granulations appear.

These are demanded for deformity of the mouth from destructive ulceration or sloughing, as from cancrum oris, and are somewhat similar to those for harelip. When undertaken for contraction of the mouth, the surgeon should always try and turn up from within the mouth, some portion of the mucous membrane to cover over tbe new angle, and thus prevent its subsequent contraction. I have done this in j several cases with gratifying success; one of which is figured below. The deformity was the result of sloughing after fever. At times new tissue must be brought up from the chin or down from the cheek. Indeed, Fig. 183. Fig. 184. Fig. 185.

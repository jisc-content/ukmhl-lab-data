On the dead subject this operation is not difficult, but the number of veins and arteries that exist in the space must ever render the operation on the living far from easy. M Ligature of To tie the axillary artery in the axilla, the arm should be well | in U^*Sdla upwards, and the course of the vessel marked out slightly pos- I terior to the middle line of the axilla. An incision should then be I made along the inner margin of the coraco-brachialis muscle through T the skin and fascia for about two or three inches, and the deep fascia ! exposed. This should be carefully divided to the whole extent of the jj wound, when the artery with its attendant nerves and veins will come into view. In this stage of the operation, the forearm should be flexed on the arm to relax the parts. The vessel, as a rule, has the median ^ nerve on its outer side and nearer to the pectoralis major muscle, and the vein and ulnar nerve to its inner side. The internal cutaneous nerve is in front.

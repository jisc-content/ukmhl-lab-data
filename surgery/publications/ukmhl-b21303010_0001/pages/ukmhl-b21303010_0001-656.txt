INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 624 no little difficulty in finding a band among the distended coils, but I regard tbe facts derivable from our post-mortem records as indicating no insurmountable obstacles to the success of an exploratory operation in the great majority of the cases of true internal strangulation, which are to be found in these records.” Dr. Brinton, in his analysis of 600 cases, points also to the same conclusions. Under these circumstances, I feel bound to express my conviction, that on the diagnosis being made of an internal strangulation, from whatever cause, the operation of “ laparotomy” should be performed. But this operation is not to be performed as a “dernier ressort” more than that for external hernia, but should be carried out as early in the progress of tbe case as the diagnosis will justify—when, in spite of the gravity of the measure, good results may be looked for. Chronic Intestinal Obstruction now claims attention, and it is to be observed “ in limine” that the clinical history of these cases is very distinct from that of the acute ; for, whereas iu the latter, the symptoms appear, as a rule, suddenly in patients who have been apparently in good health—in the former it will almost always be found that there has been for a more or less lengthened period some abdominal pain or symptom; some difficulty in obtaining a movement of the bowels or in the act of defaecation— some discharge probably of glairy mucus, of pus or of blood, separately or combined at uncertain intervals; and last, but not least, some change in the form and character of the stools, the motions at one time being liquid and loose, at another hard and marble-like, while at intervals they are pipe or tape-like. Under all circumstances there must be symptoms of long standing, and, if more acute symptoms exist when the case comes under notice, they will be found to have been grafted upon the old. If, therefore, we are called to see a patient suffer- ing from marked symptoms of obstruction of some days’ duration, and obtain such a history of the case as has j ust been sketched, and find him with abdominal tympanitic distension and probably pain, possibly visible peristalsis, nausea, vomiting, hiccough and borborygmi, we may safely come to the conclusion that the case is one of chronic obstruc- tion, and that it has for its cause one of those named in the table (page 620). It will prove to be either stricture of the colon or rectum, the mechanical pressure of a pelvic or abdominal tumour, the matting together of the intestinal coils from old or chronic inflammation of tbe peritoneum or mesentery, or from cancerous abscess; and last but not least, to fsecal accumulations, and in every case of obstruction the last possibility being the cause should be borne in mind. Rare instances are also on record in which other causes have existed; and I have given in the chapter on hernia, some in which the obstruction had been clearly traced to the influence of an adhesion between the bowel and a hernial sac or some part of the abdominal parietes, or to an obstructed obdurator or other hernia. Now the effects of obstruction, from whatever cause, are very uniform, and terminate fatally from either exhaustion or peritonitis if the obstruction is not overcome; the chronic peritonitis being directly due to tbe obstruction, and the acute to either a perforating _ ulcer of the sigmoid flexure secondary to the stricture, to some ulceration of the csecum or colon, the result of the overdistension, or to the

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. A SECOND EDITION of this manual having been called for, I have availed myself of the opportunity to make some altera- tions in the substance as well as in the aiTangement of the work, and, with a view to its improvement, have recast the materials and revised the whole. I have, also, to make the work more complete, added much new matter, including chap- ters on diseases and injuries of the eye and ear, some remarks on dental surgery, on the diagnosis of ovarian tumours, and on deformities, together with at least one hundred new wood- cuts. The book has also, for the sake of greater convenience, been divided into two volumes, the first including the elementary principles of our art, general subjects, tumours, the surgery of the cutaneous, lymphatic, nervous, circulatory, and digestive systems; and the second the surgery of the respii'atory, urino-genital, muscular, and osseous systems, gunshot wounds and amputations, with a full general index. I am well aware that I have failed to realise, in the execu- tion of my task, the ideal standard I, at starting, proposed to myself, and I knew when I first undertook to write the book how difficult it was to compress the treatment of the vast range of subjects included under the title of Surgery into one volume; but my object was to offer such an epitome of the main prin- ciples and methods of practice as should be serviceable to the student and practitioner; and from the reception the first edition of this work, published in November, 1872, has met with in Great Britain and America, I feel justified in saying

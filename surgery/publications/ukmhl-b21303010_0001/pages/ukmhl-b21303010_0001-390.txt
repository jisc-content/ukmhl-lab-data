OPERATIONS ON THE IRIS. 360 Eor swollen lens. Iridectomy instruments. In corneal staphyloma. In glaucoma. To influence nutrition. In cataract operations. (b) In injuries of the eyeball, in which the crystalline lens, being wounded, has become opaque and swollen, and is pressing on surround- ing parts, causing severe pain and threatening the integrity of some of the delicate structures within the globe. In these cases, not only does iridectomy diminish tension, and so relieve pain, but gives room for any subsequent swelling of the lens. (c) In staphyloma of the cornea iridectomy often causes complete subsidence of the projection. {d) In glaucoma a timely and well-performed iridectomy causes instant and lasting diminution of tension and places the ejâ€™e in com- parative safety; the operation should be performed on any eye that can distinguish bright light, and to relieve pain in any case whether there be perception of light or not; in acute glaucoma it must be tried even if all perception have been lost for some days. (2) To inHuence nutrition, iridectomy should be performed in chronic choroido-iritis, recurrent iritis, and in cases of total e.vclusion of the pupil, where there is no communication between the anterior and posterior division of the aqueous chamber. (3) Associated with operations for cataract iridectomy should be performed previous to a needle operation if much swelling of the lens be anticipated; or it may require to be done after the needle has been used if pain or increase of tension occur.

PKEFACE. Vll that I have not failed in the attempt, amd that the book supplied a want felt by the professional public. To the many reviewers, who have acknowledged my labours so fairly and so fully, my thanks are clearly due, but still more to the profession which has welcomed my humble seiwices so kindly. Fully alive, therefore, to the generous appreciation of my past work, and assuring my readers that no pains have been spared to bring the present iip to as high a standard as my time and opportunities have allowed, I submit it in all con- fidence to the kind consideration of my professional brethren as no unworthy exposition of modern British Surgery. In its execution I have endeavoured to acknowledge on all occasions the claims of others, and whatever merit or novelty may attach to their views or operations; for my msh has been to represent not so miich my own opinion as the position of Surgei-y at the time I write. It only remains for me to express once more my obligations, to Mr. Thomas Turner, the Treasurer of Guyâ€™s Hospital, by whose kindness the materials in the unrivalled collections of that institution were placed at my disposal; to my col- leagues, Drs. Moxon, Goodhart, and Pui-ves, Messrs. Howse, C. Higgens, and Moon; and to Mr. Wesley, the artist who has so ably illustrated these pages. Since I first undertook this work death has deprived me of two colleagues, Mr. Poland and Dr. Phillips, both of whom rendered me many friendly services and much valuable assist- ance. I refer to their names with gratitude and regret. 53, Upper Brook Street, Grosvenor Square; March, 1876.

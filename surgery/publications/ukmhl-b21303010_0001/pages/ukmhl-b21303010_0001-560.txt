Dr. Mason Warren, in 1843, described the process of separat- ing the hard from the soft palate with the view of its closure, though it has been left to Langenbeck, Billroth, Pollock, Avery, Lawson Tait, Annandale, T. Smith, and others, to perfect the process. The operation.—Chloroform is not necessary in a patient old enough to understand the necessity of being still and assisting the surgeon. In young children, with Smith’s gag, it is an advantage. The recumbent position, with the head sufficiently thrown back, is probably the best, although some surgeons make the patient sit. The operator should stand on the patient’s right side, or, in front. The steps of the operation have been hitherte as follows :—Pare the edges of the fissure j pass the sutures; para- lyse the muscles ; and fix the stitches. To pare the edges, a blunt-pointed bistoury is generally used, and a thin border of mucous membrane cut off from below up- wards, the bifid uvula being held by a tenaculum-pointed forceps (Fig. 199). The incision also should he made as clean as possi- ble. When it is made from above downwards, a sharp-pointed bis- toury is needed. To pass the sutures, a corkscrew needle may be employed, or a curved needle flat- tened laterally (Fig. 200), with a slit in it for an eye, or an eye in the end. The lowest suture should be inserted first and both ends held—this practice facilitating the introduction of the others.

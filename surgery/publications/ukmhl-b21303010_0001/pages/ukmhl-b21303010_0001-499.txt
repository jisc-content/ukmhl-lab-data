LIGATUKE OF ARTERIES. 469 In looking for tke sbeath every anatomical guide is to be made use of to prevent undue manipulation or separation of parts. Fig. 146. This diagram represents three distinet operntions. A. Opening tlie sheath. B. llrawing ligature round the artery. C. Tying artery. Fig. 14-7. Wben tbe sbeatb is found and tbe pulsating artery is felt witbin, tbe end of tbe operation is not distant. Yet many errors may be com- mitted. Every possible mistake should consequently be thought over beforehand in order to be avoided. Tbe operator must ask himself as to tbe position of tbe nerves and veins about tbe part, so as to avoid them. He need not look for them as in a dissection, for this would necessitate superfluous manipulation, but their existence ought to be present in bis mind. He should only remember their relative position to the vessel where the ligature is to be applied, and then guard against their being injured. The sheath having been found, it must Opening of be raised by the forceps and carefully opened (Fig. 146, a), such slieath. opening being only suflicient to admit a probe or aneurism needle, and the less the sheath is separated from its vessel the better. The needle Passing of (Fig. 147) with the ligature is then to be passed (Fig. 146, b), and it should be introduced between the artery and the vein, because when it is passed the other way the vein may be perforated or mistaken for fascia; yet in the hands of a careful surgeon this point need not weigh against convenience. With the exposure of the artery all anxiety ceases, for, to put an ordinary silk, wire, or catgut ligature around it is a comparatively easy task with the majority of arteries; so when this is accomplished, the operation, as such, is all but completed. To do this. Care in however, the surgeon must be careful not to elevate the artery from its bed by the ligature, but to tie tbe knot with his fingers well passed

Purves ; the latter is, I think, the more convenient of the two.* The TREATMENT of anomalies of refraction consists mainly in neutral- ising the defect hy suitable spherical lenses. We must, however, in myopia take care not to give too strong glasses. For further information on the subject of refraction the reader is referred to works treating specially of ophthalmic subjects, more espe- I cially to that on ‘ The Accommodation and Refraction of the Eye ’ < (Donders).

I By accommodation is meant the power which the eye possesses of Accommo- <t altering the condition of its refractive media, so as to form upon the Nation. ‘■| retina images of near objects, the rays of light from which are diver- gent, equally as distinct as images of more distant ones, the rays of I; light from which are parallel, or nearly so. jl The power of accommodation depends upon the elasticity of the I; crystalline lens, the curvature of which can be increased to a consider- i!i able extent; the alteration of curvature is brought about hy the action of a ring of inorganic muscular fibres, situated between the sclerotic : I and choroid, just external to the greater circumference of the iris. ■ This ring is known as the ciliary muscle. The manner in which the Ciliary / ciliary muscle acts upon the lens is as yet a disputed point, one theory muscle, being that the lens is maintained in a flattened condition by tension i 1 Many other refraction ophthalmoscopes are in use, hnt the two mentioned and another smaller and eheaper instrument, known as Loriug’s ophthalmoscope, will be I' found as useful as any.

Chap. II. of Arteries^ <^>c, 43 for putting a total flop to it.â€”The man- ner of ufing it is this. Let a culliion of three inches in length by one inch and half in diameter, be pre- pared of a linen roller, and be made tole- rably firm, but yet not fo hard as to ren- der the prefTure produced by it very pain- ful : This being placed upon the courfe of the principal artery of the limb, is to be firmly fecured in that^fituation by one or two turns of a circular roller, of the fame breadth with the cufhion itfelf. The inflrument A, with the firap con- nected with it, being now placed upon the limb, with the handle of the fcrew B on the fide of the member oppofice to the cufhion upon the artery, the fhrap G is to be carried round the limb direCtly over the cufhion, and to be firmly connected on the other fide to the buckle D. In thus connec- ting the ftrap and buckle together, parti- cular attention is necefiary in doing it with great firmnefs, fo that the fcrew may after- wards operate with as much advantage as poffible, in producing a fufficient degree of prefTure.

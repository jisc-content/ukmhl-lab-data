HEN treating of the anatomy of thefe parts, we remarked, that in a ftate of health an aqueous fecretion is always found in the tunica vaginalis; the princi- pal ufe of which feems to be, to lubricate and keep the furface of the tefticle foft and eafy. In a healthy (late, this fluid is abforbed by the lymphatics of the part; its place being as conflantly fupplied by a frefh fe- cretion : But in difeafe, it frequently hap- pens, either that the fecretion of this fluid is morbidly increafed, or that the powers of the abforbing vefTels of the part are di- minifhed.

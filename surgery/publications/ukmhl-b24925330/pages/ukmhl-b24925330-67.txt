43 AMPUTATION* In this flage of the difeafe our obje£l is not fo much to remove the dead parts as to preferve the living; it is therefore not the flate of the dead parts, but the flate of the living parts on which the operation is to be per- formed, that is to dire6l our condufl. A partial removal of the mortified parts cannot be produ£live of the leaf!: advantage; if any abforption of putrefcent matter does take place, it mufl be from that part which is in immediate contact with the living, and as it would be impoffible to fepa- rate the dead and living parts without fome painful operation, this addi- tional injury would exafperate the difeafe, and increafe the danger. In a fcientific view the removal of part of a dead limb is certainly not worthy of our confideration, but trifling as it may appear to the furgeon, either in fcience or in practice, the patient may view the bufmefs in a differ- ent light; and in fuch cafes of danger and diftrefs, every probability of alarming the patient fhould be carefully avoided : at the fame time we fhould confider that this firfl operation does not end the bufinefs, and whe- ther it is, or is not performed, the fecond will be equally neceffary. The part where the operation might take place is not mentioned; but as Mr. Bell’s objeft is to prevent the abforption of putrefcent matter, he certainly would fix on fome part beyond the limits of putrefa£lion. In the few inflances where the patient furvives the mortification cf a limb, we muflexpe£l to find the whole fyftem much exhaufled; in this flate to operate would certainly not be advifable, except by fuch hafly proceedings fome impending danger was to be avoided, or fome confiderable advan- tage to be obtained. By reafonable delay, the conflitution will acquire returning energy, and the

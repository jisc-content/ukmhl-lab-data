Every judicious method may be made ufe of and the bed dire&ed efforts tried in vain, and the operation may be determined upon ; in confequence of which, apprehea- fion and defpair may fcize the patient’s mind, general relaxation may- take place, and under thefe circumflances the hernia be returned.

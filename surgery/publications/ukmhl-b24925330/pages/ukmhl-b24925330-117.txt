93 PHYSIOLOGY. Why a (late of difeafe (hould have been made choice of as the moft pro- per period for fuch obfervations, I am at a lofs to conje&ure, as the a&i- on of the vafcular fyftem is in all probability as univerfal in a ftate of health, as when under the influence of difeafe. But if the facfs are as here Rated, we mufl admit the inference; for reafon and argument both lofe their power, the queftion depending alone on the evidence of fafts; and if the veins do not dilate and contratt and pulfate like the arteries* we mufl then admit that the motion of the blood in the veins does not depend on the action oi the heart. Doctor Whytt examined this fubjeft with confiderable attention about fifty years ago, and he then endeavoured to prove %that the power of the heart does not reach the ext remities of the arterial fy ftem; to make up for this defe6t of power a new hypothefis was then brought forward, and the fmall arteries were fuppofed to be actuated by principles inherent in them- felves. Which of thefe two high authorities mufl we then fubfcribe to? it is certain that they cannot both be in the right; but I dare not prefume to give an opinion with equal confidence that they may not both be wrong, as it is much eafier to invent an hypothefis than to inveftigate the me- chanifm of nature. Do&or Whytt has attempted to illuftrate his opinion by a difplay of mathematical demonftration; but fihe feems fo wel1 con- vinced of the mifapplication, that it is not neceflary I fhould now intro- duce any argument to prove the inconfiflency. But notwithftanding all that Do£tor Whytt has faid to the contrary, X * Whytt’s works, page 225. f Whytt’s works, page 218, A a am

320 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. Bat it is particularly after fever that the powers of the bark are mo A cos- fpicuous; it may aCl in part as a cordial or ftimulus to the fyftem, but lam difpofed to think that the falutary effe&s depend more on its powers of deflroying the laid effort of fever, than by exciting the healthy pow- ers to flronger a&icn. It will here be necefiary to obferve, that it is in the laft ftage of fever that the bark is mod efficacious, after the paroxyfm of an intermittent or in the advanced period of putrid fever; and as the morbid (late of the fyffem, which precedes the commencement of mortification, is a difeafe of the putrid kind, it muff: a priori appear a proper remedy in this dif- eafe ; but I am well fatisfied on the authority of experience, and the evi- dence of facls, that I have feen its effeCis in mortifications more clearly exemplified than in any other fpecies of putrid difeafe. When mortification takes place in confequence of external injury to the extremities, it has already been fhewn that the previous inflam- mation is not produClive of fizy blood, which I confider a hate of the conftitution incompatible with the falutary influence of the bark; and this is alfo a fpecies of difeafe that is unconnected with any of thofe affections of the vifcera which frequently accompany putrid fever, and which would render the bark improper. The objeCt on this occafion is, to ftimulate the finking povers into a&ion, and to prevent the abforption of the putrid fanies; and I am well convinced of the in- fluence of the bark under fuch ciicumflarces, and have repeatedly had the fatisfa&ion of noticing the progreflive efifeds of its falutary powers.

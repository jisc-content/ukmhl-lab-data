368 THE OPERATIVE without a fpeedy amputation, it is then the furgeon’s bufinefs to face all the difficulties with which he is furrounded. It is faid to be almoft impoffible for a furgeon, in many inftances, to make himfelf mafter of a cafe fo as to perform fitch a capital operation with propriety; but this will depend much on his abilities and addrefs. I have already given an inftance of a cafe in a public hofpital where there was time for deliberation, where one furgeon gave his opinion in oppofition to another, in confequence of which the patient loft his life. It is not to be fuppofed that army lurgeons will always be more free from errors than thofe who attend the hofpitals ; but whatever fituation a man is placed in, he is to aft to the beft of his abilities, and whatever thofe diffi- culties may be, this does not alter the principles by which he is to regu- late his conduft. As for the operation itfelf I am happy in an opportunity of coinciding with Mr. Bell, who fays, that it is an operation which any furgeon can get through with*, indeed it is a bufinefs fo generally underftood, that to make a difficulty of amputating a limb muft be conftdered a reflection on the prefent ftate of furgery. For my own part, it is only from defcription and conjefture that I can form an opinion of the field of battle; and though I am ready to ac- knowledge that I have never yet experienced either the glow of martial ardour, or the fear of a ball, yet I do not intend to eftablifh any apology on the want of information, or plead ignorance of the nature of gun-fhot wounds, the operations of furgery, or the method of cure. * Bell’s lyftem of Surgery, vol. 6, fifth edition, page 302c It

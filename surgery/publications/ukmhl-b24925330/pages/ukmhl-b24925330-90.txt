66 PHYSIOLOGY* There certainly is a great propriety in giving plates on fuch fubje&s, as it affords an opportunity of forming fome opinion of what has been fup- pofed to have been feen on thefe occafions, and without plates the deferip- tions would be unintelligible. Mr. Chefelden, whofe book was publifhed about forty years after Leu- Wenhoekâ€™s fuppofed difcovery, has given two plates of microfcopic repre- fentations; but does not mention whether the plates were engraved ac- cording to his own directions, as deferiptions of experimental evidence, or whether they were copied from others. The manner of conducing the experiments fhould have been minutely deferibed, and the power of the microfcope, and the method of expofing the obje&s to view, fhould liave been explained. To thofe, who are not well acquainted with the ufe of optical inftru- tnents, it may be neceffary to mention, that the larger the magnifying power, the lefs will be the focal diftance; in confequence of which, fo large a body as the tail of a filh could not be examined with a glafs of great magnifying power. Microfcopes are generally furnifhed with little glafs tubes for this pur- pofe, and in deferiptions of the microfcope we frequently meet with re- prefentations of thefe glafs tubes with little fifh in them, in the manner they are prepared for thefe experiments; and fuch deferiptions make very pretty pi&ures, and may by fome be thought to look well on paper, but in pra&ice they only ferve to amufe the credulous, or to impede the pro- / grefs of inquiry.

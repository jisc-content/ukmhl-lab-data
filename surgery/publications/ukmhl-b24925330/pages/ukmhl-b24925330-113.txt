And if fuch is the fimplicity of nature, it is neceflary that the arteries fhould be cylindrical; for in all parts of a cylindrical veflel the blood would move with the fame velocity; and as fluids prefs equally in all di- re&ions, the fame impulfe, with which the blood is impelled into any branch of the arterial fyftem, will operate equally throughout the whole extent. And if we divide the arterial fyftem into parts, andclafs the ramificati- ons according to their refpeftive diameters, as the fum of the diameters of the branches exceeds that of the trunk from which they originate, the velocity of the blood will confequently diminifh in proportion as the num- ber of ramifications is increafed. This circumftance, which is univerfally admitted *by all writers on the anatomy of the blood veflels, furnilhes us with a fatisfaffory anfwer to the fuppofition, + that mortification fometimes takes place in the extremities*. * “ From what has been faid it muft appear that the arteries forma cone whofe apex is at the heart.5' I, Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 171., t “ Sometimes the fluids of the body are fo vitiated as to lofe their proper nutritious qualities, and the limb becomes gangrened, not from an Alteration ofits Veflels, but chiefly from its fltuation, which being at a great diftance from the Heart, will be more prone to feel the ill effe&s of a bad blood, than- any other part, as the circulation is more languid in the extremities.55 Sharp’s furgery, third edition, page 213*. in Z

163 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. The nal caufe, in which Mr. Pott afferts that the bark is not efficacious ; nor does it appear from this inflance that the bark was produ&ive of any fa- int ary confequences; for Mr. Rufhworth obferves that the difeafe was cu- red by incifions and fcarifications. But let us here attend to the manner in which thefe operations were performed; deep incifions were made in the mortified parts to the bone. If the mortification reached the bone, the incifions would do no harm, but if the incifions exceeded the limits of the mortification they would then be prejudicial. I fhall not attempt to determine what diftinftion fhouldbe made on this occafion between inci- fions and fcarifications, but we are then informed that he fcarrified all round, as far as there was any inflammation : if thefe fcarifications were made on an inflamed part, they would certainly aggravate the difeafe, if they were on the parts already dead, they were both ufelefs and unnecef- fary. But by incifions, fcarifications, and the common applications, the fever abated, the pulfe became calm and regular, and digeftion was procured. Yet the difeafe in a fhort time returned, and the fame remedies were made ufe of with fimilar fuccefs. The difeafe returned a third time, and the fame plan of treatment again fucceeded. He does not fay that the difeafe re- turned a fourth time, but he fays providence now (I fuppofe he means af- ter the third cure was accomplifhed) dire£fed me to order the bark in this cafe, whilfl there was a remiffion of the fever; and then adds, “that it anfwered beyond what he expe&ed, the fever no more returned;” from which we find, that the bark was given in this cafe after the recove- ry ; but, notwithflanding the perfeftion of this cure, the leg was taken off.

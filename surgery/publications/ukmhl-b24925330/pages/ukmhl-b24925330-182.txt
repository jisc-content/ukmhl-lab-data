HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. 158 When Mr. Sharp published his critical Enquiry in the year 17505 the bark had then been ufed as a remedy in mortifications for more than thir- ty years. He was a man of extenfive information and found judgment, and might jufily be confidered as prefiding at the head of his profeffion: he had for many years been a teacher of anatomy, and furgeon to Guy's hofpital, where he had frequent opportunities of feeing the effects of this new method of praflice; and yet, after deliberately examining the fubjefi, he gives it as his decided opinion that the bark was not an efficacious remedy in cafes of mortification. This publication of Mr. Sharp’s im- mediately became a fubjeft of general attention, and is mentioned by mofl fucceeding writers; but the above obfervations have I believe never yet been noticed, and the bark has been made ufe of for thefe lafl fifty years with the fame blind enthufiafm, as if his obje&ions had never made their appearance. About the year feventy-nine*, Mr. Pott publifhed his obfervations on the mortification of the toes and feet, and pointedly denies the efficacy of the bark in this fpecies of difeafe. Now if we examine the cafes that have been recorded on this fubjefi, where the bark was fuppofed to flop the progrefs of the difeafe; we fhall find that moff of the inffances were of this kind, in which Mr. Pott afferts that it is not efficacious. Mr. Sharp obferves that mortification frequently flops fpontaneoufly, independent of the influence of medicine; and if, agreeably to Mr. Pott’s opinion, the bark has no influence in cafes of mortification of the toes and feet, the inference is unqueflionable that, in all thefe cafes that were fup- • Pott’s chirurgical works, fecond edition, 1 fjg, pofed

140 THE PRINCIPLES OF convenient. But if the expedition, with which the blood is evacuated, be found to increafe its falutary influence, then the lancet will prove the moft efficacious; and this opinion is fo clearly eftablifhed on the evidence of general experience, that I believe none of the advocates for topical bleeding will prefume to affert, that they would depend alone on either cupping or leeches in a truly phlogiftic difeafe, in preference to more copious and expeditious evacuations by the lancet. In cafes of violent inflammation, where a fhort fpace of time is to de- cide the fate of the patient, and where the fuccefs depends, not only on the powers of the remedies made ufe of, but alfo in a great meafure on the expedition with which they are adminiftered: it certainly would be highly irrational to depend on the precarious fucking of a leech, or the tedious operation of a cupping glafs ; where any quantity of blood, that the urgency of the difeafe might be fuppofed to require, could be taken in a few minutes by a fingle punÂ£ture of a vein in the arm. It is rather fingular that Sydenham, who appears to have been fo well acquainted with the effects of bleeding, ftiould have fuppofed that, in cafes of pleurify, bleeding was more efficacious when taken from the arm on the painful fide; for, as he prafticed and wrote fubfequent to the time of Harvey, it is reafonable to fuppofe that a man of his abilities would have been too well acquainted with the courfe of the circulation to have retained fuch an irrational prejudice. The choice, once given to different veins according to the feat of the difeafe, is now I believe but little attended to; as bleeding in the cepha- lic vein, in difeafes of the head; and this is a fpecies of topical bleeding that

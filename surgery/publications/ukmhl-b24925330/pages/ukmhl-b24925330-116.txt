PHYSIOLOGY# 9* in fome degree illuflrated by the velocity of the difcharge’in venefe&ion $ and we find by the fame evidence that the power of the contra&ion of the veins increafes in proportion to their diflention; but the power with which the veins contract is inferior to that of the arteries. The vacuity of the arteries after death has been noticed by fome of the firfl writers on this fubjeft and urged in proof of this opinion; but I think that the pale- nefs of the face, and the difappearance of inflammation in the eyes during a fainting fit, may be confidered as much more fatisfaftory, as in thefe inftances we have an opportunity of obferving thefe phenomena without the lofs of life. Refpefling the caufe of the motion of the blood in the veins, we meet with a difference of opinion ; Mr. I. Hunter fuppofes that it depends on the power of the heart. He fays, <e the firfl caufe of the blood’s motion in a vein of a quadruped, is the force of the heart; for I think we mull fuppofe that the heart can, and does carry on fimple circulation But Mr. I. Hunter feems apprehenfive of the objection before flated; that if the motion of the blood in the arteries and veins depended on the fame caufe, we fhould meet with a fimilarity of effeH; for he cautioufly guards againfl the difficulty, by admitting the conclufion. He fays, " I think it is probable, that where there is an univerfal a6lion of the vafcular fyflem, the a6lion of the arteries and veins is alternate, that when the arteries con-. tra£l, as in many fevers, the veins rather dilate, more efpecially the lar- gerf,” <* I.

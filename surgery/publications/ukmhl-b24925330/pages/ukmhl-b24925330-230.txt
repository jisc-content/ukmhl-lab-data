J 206 CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. When the firft fuppuration had fubfided, a fecond inflammation took place, by which the integuments and the fafcia of the mufcle were united, and another tumour formed, which terminated like the former; and thus the difeafe went on by fhort ftages and tedious progrt Is, till it arrived at the origin of the mufcle, in the outward apophyfb of the os humeri.

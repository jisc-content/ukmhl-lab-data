HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. 200 refpefftingthe comparative powers of the different preparations of thebark, and afierts that half the quantity of the refin or extract would anfwer the purpofe in cafes of mortification, becaufe it is fuppofed that thefe refpec- tive dofes are equally efficacious in intermittent fever; and immediately afterwards he endeavours to prove that thefe two difeafes have not the Jeafl refemblance to each other. But what is (till more unintelligible, this ingenious writer has before informed us that the bark is not a proper re- medy in intermittent fevers; in which he “obferves that the ufe of the bark is generally noxious and fometimes fatal.” I fhall not attempt to reconcile all thefe contradictions, or take upon myfelf to fet in a clear point of view a fubjeCl that appears to me inex- plicable. Thefe cafes have been repeatedly copied by others becaufe they were fuppofed to contain indifputable evidence of the falutary powers of the bark as a remedy in mortification. I have given my opinion in plain terms, and the public muff determine. But if thefe cafe writers were fo unfortunate firft to impofe upon themfelves, as I think it impoflible that fuch a fyftem of confufion could have been formed by defign, it would be difficult to conjefiure by what magic art the delufion was transferred to the public at large; and, for my own part, I (hould never ceafe to wonder, if I had not previoufly examined the dark hiftory of human nature, and was well convinced how much the world is gratified by impofition and deceit.

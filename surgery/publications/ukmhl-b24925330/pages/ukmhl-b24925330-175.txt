TOPICAL BLEEDING# *5* The fpecies of fympathy, which is made the bafis of his argument, is certainly the moil fimple; it is in reality no more than a local affection; and if it is to have this nominal diftin&ion, it is fo limited that it can on- ly be conlidered as a part fympathizing with itfelf. If we admit that bleeding on an inflamed part will produce the effefl that he aflerts it does produce, this is no proof that bleeding on the external parts fliall by the power of fympathy relieve internal difeafe. Blifters are in general made ufe of with this intention; and in cafes of external inflammation are frequently applied to the neighbouring parts beyond the limits of difeafe; for inftance, in cafes of eryfipelas of the head and face, they are applied to the ffioulders with great advantage. But if this be an ufeful practice when applied to diftant parts, we are not to con- clude that they might be applied to the part aflefled with equal fafety and advantage; fo, by a parity of reafoning, if the application of leeches was evidently proved to be an efficacious remedy when made ufe of to the part affe&ed, this is no proof that their influence would extend from an external part which was in a date of health to an internal feat of difeafe. In one inflance we are told that topical bleeding ce a£is by continued fympathy*,” and immediately afterwards we are informed, “likewife, that contiguous fympathy comes into a£Hon,” from which it appears, that all kinds of fympathy are equally convenient for his purpofe; but the whole argument depends on the philofophy of authority, and reafon is not once appealed to. * I.

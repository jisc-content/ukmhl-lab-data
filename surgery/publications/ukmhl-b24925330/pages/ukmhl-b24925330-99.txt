75 PHYSIOLOGY* The vacuity of the arteries after death was particularly noticed by the firft: anatomifts, long before the courfe of the blood was difcovered, or the ufe of the arteries known. It was from this circumftance that the ar» teries firft took their name; it being at firft fuppofed, as they were found empty after death, that they only contained air during life, and were con- fequently confidered condu&ors of air.* This circumftance is mentioned both by Boerhave and Haller, for the purpofe of proving that the contraftile power of the arteries is fuperiorto that of the veins. And at the fame time that the vacuity of the arteries clearly determines that part of the argument, I {hall venture to give it as my humble opinion, which their relaxation proves with equal evidence, that the contradlion of the arteries depends on mufcular power. It has long appeared very lingular to me, that a fa6l of fuch importance fhould at the prefent day be fo little noticed: for independent of any fci- entific views, it is alfo frequently neceflary for the adminiftration of im- partial juftice, that the natural appearances after death fhould be generally * “The name Artery is derived, f o’.isb rS r olegx from its containing Air; for the firft Veffel thus denominated, was that we now call the trachea or Windpipe, the Ateries themfelves being in the early Times of Hippocrates termed beating, or internal Veins, in contradiction to the external Veins, which have no Motion. But after Hippocrates, the notion of Erafijlratus prevailing, till it was refu- ted by Galen, that the Canals we now call Arteries, received a Quantity of Air in their diaflole from the Heart, which they expelled in their Svftole; thefe Veffcls were from that Time named arterix. This Air they fuppofed the Arteries received from the left Ventricle of the Heart, which again took it from the Lungs; holding likewife, that the fame Ventricle received but a very little Blood which tranfuded into it through the mufcular Septum of the Heart. At that time they diftinguifhed two Kinds of Air-veffels or Arteries, arifing from the left fide of the Heart; the one which we call the Aorta, they by way of eminence named artcriq, aiteriofa; the other, which appeared to have the Struc« iure of a Vein, they termed arteria venofa.” Boerhaave’s ledures, vol. 2, page 3, known

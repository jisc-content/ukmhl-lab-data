305 MEDICINAL TREATMENT, Ms obfervations on this fubjeCt firft made their appearance in the intro- duction to his treatife on the venereal difeafe, I was in expe&ation of finding a full explanation of the molt important morbid afiions that are incompatible with the venereal difeafe. It may here be necefiary to mention, that the introduction to the trea- tife on the venereal difeafe and that on gun-fliot wounds are nearly fim fi- lar, (1 do not fay that the difeafes themfelves are reprefemed as analo- gous), but it mud appear rather fingular, that in the former indance the lad fefliori, which is on mortification, is preceded by a feflion on inflam- mation ; whereas, in the introduflion to the treatife on gun-fliot wounds,, the fe&ion on inflammation is omitted; but in both introductions he men- tions “the fufpenfion or cure of a gonorrhoea by a fever which is not given as a matter of opinion, but is certainly reprefented as an uoquefti- enable truth. Mr. Pearfon is of opinion that neither fever nor inflammation pof- fefles the power of fufpending the venereal difeafe *; and with refpefi to the former I have no evidence to produce againft him, but I am well convinced from repeated experience that a phlogiflic diathefis will com- pletely fufpend the venereal difeafe; and three unquedionabie indances aow prefent themfelves to my recolledion. The fird I fhall allude to was a cafe of eryfipela*, where the inflamma- tory fymptoms ran high, where bleeding was frequently repeated, and the * Obfervation« on the effects of various articles of the Materia Medica in the cure of the Luee Venerea, by John Pearfon, page 84. 4f blood

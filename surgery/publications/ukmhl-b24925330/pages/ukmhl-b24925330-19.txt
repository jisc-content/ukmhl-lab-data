The waters of the ocean flow at liberty on the furface, and move in obedience to the combined influence of attrac- tion and centrifugal power; but the fluids of the animal bo- dy are all furrounded with, and confined in, their proper vefiels; and confequently, if they were fuhjedl to the fame -external influence, flill it would be impoffible that they fhould ebb or flow correfpondent to the tides. The attrac- tion of the fun and moon operate both on the folids and fluids of the animal body, and diminifh the gravity of the whole in proportion to their attraflive power, and the cen- trifugal power will operate on both in a fimilar direftion; but

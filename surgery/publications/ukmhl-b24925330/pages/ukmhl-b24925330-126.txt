102 MORTIFICATION IN If tion into two fpecies, but the writers on modern furgery exerted their ut- moft induftry to reftore the whole to its original obfcurity. Doctor Underwood has made four fpecies of mortification*, but his divifion will neither improve our knowledge of the difeafe, nor aftift in di- rearing the method of cure. The laid caufe that he mentions is dyfcracy, but if he intended to reprefent this as a fpecific caufe of a diftinft: fpecies of difeafe, it would not have been neceffary to have added, that the different kinds might all depend upon external injury. I do not pretend to deny that a certain degree of external injury, would not be more likely to ter- minate in mortification when connefled with a bad conftitution, than with agoodone; but that difeafe which is the effe&of external injury fhould have beein confidered independent of any other circumftances; and when theftate of the conftitution becomes the caufe, as is fo particularly exem- plified in the mortification of the toes and feet, if we admit this new the- ory, we fhall find that the rational diftin&ions of Mr. Pott muft fink into obfcurity. The defcription that Mr. Pott has given is an accurate reprefentation of nature, but the hypothefis before us is compofed of a pompous affem- blage of words without any rational fignification. Thefe obfervations are faid to have been written for the improvement of the younger ftudent, but in my opinion the maturity of experience will not be able to aflimi- late this theory with the evidence of nature. * <{ Gangrenes may bediflinguifhed into four kinds; fuch as arifefrom irritation, attended w ith more Or lefs inflammation ; from an inflammatory diathefisof the fyftem; from general debility ; and from dyfcracy, to each of thefe fpecies external injuries may give rife, or become the remote caufe.” Dr. fjjaderwood’s furgical tra£ls, page 277.

MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 284 The I had then been in the habit of giving the digitalis in hedlie cafes for fome years ; and fuppofing it the only medicine that was likely to abate the difcharge, I diredfed two grains of the powder of digitalis to be taken every night and morning, which was continued at intervals for more than two months; but whenever the ftomach became affedled it was then omitted for a few days, and when the naufea had fubfided it was again re- fumed. The difcharge of matter gradually diminifhed, and in about two months completely ceafed. The parties, from motives of ceconomy, did not require regular at- tendance; and as I confidered it a loft cafe, I was perhaps on that account lefs folicitous ; I confidered the cafe defperate, and the remedy the laft refource ; and when I urged the propriety of perfeverance, I cannot fay that I had any very fanguine expedition of fuccefs. If I had then had more frequent opportunities of making obfer- vations, I might now be more accurate in my defcription ; but I have nothing but the dates and prefcriptions to aftift my recolledlion, and I fhall not now attempt to fill up the vacancies with conjectures. I find, by referring to my account books, that I firft vifited this patient on the fourth of May one thoufand feven hundred and ninety-two, and that on the fixteenth of June I began to give two grains of digitalis in powder every night and morning, which appears to have been continued, with fome fhort intervals of omiftion, until the laft week in Auguft, when the account terminates ; and the patient, who was at that time about ten years of age, has been perfedfly well ever fince.

IO9. CUN-SHOT WOUNDS. fhot wounds, we meet with fome obfervations on the effects of bleeding; but in many infiances thefe obfervarions are obfcnre, and in fome they are unintelligible. In one place bleeding is ftrongly recommended, in ano- ther we are told that this remedy is to be ufed with the greateff caution. Topical bleeding is alfo recommended on the parts already in a hate of inflammation, but we do not meet with many powerful arguments in f p- port of thefe opinions; and as thefe opinions may by fome be thought rather fingular, they fhould have been both protefted and explained. The fubjeft is certainly of importance, as this is a very powerful reme- dy in cafes of inflammation; I fhall therefore endeavour more fully to explain the effefts of bleeding in a feparate fedlion. It is affected that * “a man will bear bleeding better after an amputation of the arm than the leg; better after a compound fracture of the arm than the leg, he will bear bleeding better after an injury done to the head, chef!, the lungs &c. than either the armor leg;” and all this is given without the leaf! explanation in fupport of it. And what application can be made of thefe obfervations* either in a fcientific or praftical view, I am at a lofs to conjechire. It is not aqueftion which will bear bleeding beff, but which will require it moft; and for my own part I am of opinion, that bleeding will be very rarely neceffary in cafes of amputation.

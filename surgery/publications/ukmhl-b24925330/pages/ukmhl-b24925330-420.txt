THE OPERATIVE 39s' the public on this occasion, that the furgeon’s abilities are in general edimated by the extent of the operation. But this is not merely a quedion of profeffional policy, it will be found to be a fubje£l of great practical importance. The facility with which an unlearned operator may remove a portion of the fcalp, and make a perforation with the trepan through any part of the fkull where there is no ine- quality in the thicknefs of the bone, may fometimes prove a recom- mendation to this operation in cafes where it is unneceflary : but to form a critical opinion of the degree and extent of the injury, and to determine under all circumdances where the trepan may be applied with the lead hazard, and the greated probability of fuccefs, not only requires an accurate knowledge of the anatomy of the pans, but it will be alfo neceffary to form an opinion of the degree and extent of the dif- eafe, and for this purpofe to edimate the effe61s of inflammation on the integuments, on the bones, on the membranes, and on the brain. From this view of the fubje6l we fhall be led to the confideration of the fame principle that has already been pointed out as an important obje£l in the fcientific department of the operations of furgery. And as 1 am apprehenfive that the progrefs of inflammation, in cafes of wounds, contufions, and fra&ures of the fkull, is a fubjeft that has in general paffed unnoticed, for that reafon it becomes an obje£i more deferving our attention. It frequently happens in very extenfive inju- ries of this kind that large portions of the integuments will dough away, that the parts of the fkull will die, and be removed by a tedious procefs of exfoliation, and all this will be attended with inflammation. And though the degree of inflammation in fome indances may be inconsi- derable, yet the degree of injury and the confequences will always bear a certain

THE OPERATIVE 380 but whether by the needle or tenaculum Teems doubtful. For my own I think the tenaculum much lefs convenient than the needle for 1 nail arteries ; and I have heard of furgeons, M'ho give a decided prefer- ence to this ind rumen t, who have'been much longer about an operation than if they had ufed the needle. I hope it -will not be thought tnat I would advife imprudent hade in performing-an operation ; deliberation and fleadinefs are certainly the ftronged chara&eridics of profefiional accomplifliments ; it is not hady execution which lam contending for, but I wifh to point out every in- cumbrance that may embarrafs the operator, or in any refpeft occafion unneceffary delay. Great as are the advantages of the needle and ligature, every objeftion was raifed againd them that a blind prejudice could fugged; and the predltre of the ligature on the extremity of a divided nerve was fuppofed to be more dangerous than the cautery itfelf. The tenaculum was cer- tainly well defigned to obviate thefe objefiions ; but, as it is not fanCtioned with a uniformity of approbation, it dill remains a quedion whether the needle and ligature were attended with thofe inconveniences that have frequently been laid to their charge. Mr. Sharp, in his critical enquiry, has given a very accurate hidoryof the introduction of the needle and ligature ; and it is principally on ac- count of one of his obfervations that I have been induced to enter into this difeudion. He appeals to authorities, with which he feems to coin- cide, for the purpofe of proving that ligatures on the nerves are very innocent

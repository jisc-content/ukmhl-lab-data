l8g HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. ctIn Tome infiances of mortifications, I have feen fingular good effedls from giving the Bark in much larger quantities than commonly prefcri- bed *:• Mr. Shipton, after recapitulating what had been faid on this fubjeft by preceding writers, defcribes two cafes; one a mortification of the toes and feet, where the bark did not fucceed; the other a mortification in confequence of agun-fhot wound, in which the bark was fuppofed to be efficacious.

For removing all which; efpecially fince the increaf- ed Quantity of Urine feems to require the aftringent Qualities of the Bark; and fince both Mr. Rujhworth’s and Mr. Amyand’s Trials promifed Suc- cefs, Mr. Shipton propofed it to the Phvficians and Surgeons, to which they eafily agreed, fince they were fatisfied from feveral fruitlefs Trials, that amputation would be of no Service: But tho’ two Scruples of the * Gooch on furgery, vol. 2, page 371, A a a Bark

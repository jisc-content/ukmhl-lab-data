PART OF SURGERY. 373 When a ligature is applied above the elbow for the purpofe of bleed- ing in the^arm, it frequently happens that the artery is fo compreffed as to prevent the circulation of the blood through the arm; and this is a circumflance which every one, who has been accuflomed to perform this operation, mull repeatedly have obferved. If then a ligature, which is fo moderately tight as what is ufed for the purpofe of bleeding, frequently flops the courfe of the blood through the arteries, the violent force that is generally made ufe of by the tourniquet mufl be unr.ecefTary. When a limb is to be amputated, the tigbtnefs of the ligature may not be of much confequence; but when this inflrument is ufed in the field for the purpofe of flopping the difcharge of blood from a wounded limb that is to be amputated at a diflant period, it is a circumftance of great importance that the ligature fhould not be fcrewed more tight than juft what is neceffary to flop the haemorrhage ; and this by a little care and obfervation may eafilv be accomplifhed, as the flopping of the difcharge of blood from the wounded parts will prove a proper index to the regu- lation of the preffure. On this occafion there can be no doubt whether the fcrew or twill tourniquet fhould be made ufe of; by the former the tightnefs of the bandage may be regulated with the greatefl accuracy, and I have always confidered the latter fuch a clumfy inflrument, that it has long been a fubjefd of aflonifhment to me why fuch an imperfeft inflrument fhould be retained in practice. If it is a matter of no importance whether the pref- fure is jufi fufficient or ten times more than neceffary, and if* the uncer- tainty and irregularity are marks of perft&ion, then the twill tourniquet will claim the preference. 4 Y Thefe

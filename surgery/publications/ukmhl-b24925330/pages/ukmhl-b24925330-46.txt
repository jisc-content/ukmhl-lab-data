1 THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION Mr. Sharp mentions this difeafe, but in lefs pointed terms *; in his trea- tife on the operations of furgery, he attributes a gangrene in the toes to edification in the arteries. About ten years afterwards he reviews the fubjeft with more accurate attention, and then he fays, “if from old age or any infirmity of body the blood fnould become fo impoverifhed, as to lofe its nutritious qualities, and the toes fhould begin to mortify before any other part, merely as the circulation in them is more languid, which will therefore confequently difpofe them to feel the firft effects of a depra- ved blood; in this inftance alfo, the impropriety will be obvious, for if the mortification arifes from the caufe I have fuggefied, it is impofiible to knowfo exa6lly the date of the blood, as to decide how much of the ex- tremity would have perifhed; and without that knowledge, it will be rafli to amputated.” The difeafe, here alluded to, is certainly the mortification of the toes and feet, and though the bafis of his argument is hypothetical, the con- clufion againfl the propriety of amputation is without doubt, at this time, eftablifhed on rational principles, and fupported by experience. The writers on modern furgery feem to have agreed to be particularly cautious on what occafions they refer to the opinions of their predeceffors ; and yet we frequently meet with fulficient evidence to prove that their works have not altogether paffed unnoticed.

Hun- ter, are the fame that were firft diftinguifhed by Mr. Pott, the inaccuracy with refpeft to the remedies appropriated to each difeafe will render the whole fubjefl unintelligible. In one inftance opium is fuppofed to be the only remedy, and the bark a ufelefs medicine; but in the account before us, * bark and opium are both indifcriminately recommended, as general remedies in every fpecies of difeafe. In one place we are told, that fi mortification is of two kinds; the one without inflammation, the other preceded by it. The firft, I fuppofe, is the mortification of the toes and feet, the latter that which is the confe- quence of external injury. In another place our author obferves, that “inflammation often produces mortification or death in the part inflamed and then adds, “this commonly takes place in old people that are become very much debilitated, and chiefly in the lower extremities J.” This paf- age to me is abfolutely unintelligible; for if by mortification of the ex- tremities our author means that of the toes and feet, this defcription muft be confidere'd inaccurate. |] The mortification of the toes and feet is not * I.

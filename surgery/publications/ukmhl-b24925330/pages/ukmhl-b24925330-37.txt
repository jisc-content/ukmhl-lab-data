9 TREATMENT OF MORTIFICATION* ffammation to the termination of mortification, which are here crowded togetherVithout proper precedency or diftin6Hon, the bark is never men- tioned, and evacuations feem to be the only remedies; but when “the mortification is feemingly flopped, the difeafed parts begin to feparate, and a thin difcharge and great in quantity follows; in thefe circumftan- ces, he obferves, the bark fhould be given as frequently as the flomach will bear it.” The firfl part of thefe obfervations prefents us with fome ob- fcure infinuations againft the propriety of giving the bark in cafes of mortification, and yet the bark is recommended in cafes of debility, to fup- port the energy of the fyflem and promote fuppuration ; but, at the fame time that he feems to doubt its efficacy, he has not fufficient confidence in his own opinion to exprefs himfelf in plain intelligible language.

36 AMPUTATION. ken place amputation is made ufe of with an intention of flopping the progrefs of difeafe, the event will no longer be uncertain, the operation decides the fate of the patient, and death is the inevitable confequence. The plain truth is this, it is always improper to amputate a limb when the body is in a difeafed flate; fo that when,inflammation has taken place it is improper; and though mortification is certain to fucceed, there is no period after the commencement of inflammation, when the operation can be performed with fafety, until the mortification has terminated, and all morbid a£lion ceafed. It is then obferved in favour of this argument, that “when mortification is very extenfive, the patient will commonly fall a facrifice to the dif- eafe, whether the operation be performed or not*.55 This may be true, for in all cafes of extenfive mortification the danger muft be great, and the event uncertain, but the fa6t as here ftated does not furnifh us with any inflrudlive evidence. In all cafes that are incurable, the patient muff inevitably die, whether the operation is, or is not performed; but cafes may occur where the difeafe would not prove incurable if the operation was not performed, where nature might have fupported the vital powers againft the influence of difeafe independent of the operation, but where the influence of difeafe and the operation united may deftroy the powers of nature. Amputation is therefore improper in all cafes of gangrene; in flight * Bell’s fyftem of furgery, vol. 6, page 312, fifth edition. degrees

PHYSIOLOGY* the 7* The voluntary and involuntary contra&ion is afterwards made to con- fift of voluntary mufcular a&ion and of elafticity; in one inftance fphinc- teric contra&ion is called contradlile elaflicity, but afterwards this is changed to a fuflaining power by mufcular contra&ion. Mr. I. Hunter then adds, ‘-'that the voluntary a&ion of thefe mufcles is greater than the involuntary*;” I fuppofe he means that a powerful exertion of the con- tra&ile powers by the di&ates of the will, is ftronger than a Iefs exertion of which perhaps we may not be confcious, Thefe different fpecies of mufcular aftion appear to me irreconcilable, and in what manner or degree they are applicable to the mechanifm of the vafcular fyflem, will become the next objeft of our inquiry. To fum up the whole of this defcription of voluntary and involuntary motions, we are then informed that the power of involuntary contrac- tion commonly remains longer than the voluntary; and now we come to the application of all this preparatory reafoning, if fo it may be called, to the afiion of the heart and arteries. He fays, “thus the mufcular ac- tion of the arteries is longer retained than that of the heard".” If we al- low any connection in this ftatement of the argument, it is at once affert- ing that the aftion of the arteries is involuntary, and the adion of the heart voluntary. I do not objeft to the fa61, that the arteries continue to a6i longer than * I. Hunter on gun-friot wounds, page 104. f I. Hunter on gun-fliot wounds, page 105,

MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 249 ral difeafe the public at large cannot have the critical attention of the fa- culty, a general plan of treatment may be made ufe of with propriety, and fometimes with advantage. But I cannot fay that I have met with many inftanccs, where I had an opportunity of paying a critical attention to the progrefs of the difeafe in a multiplicity of cafes, in which a varie- ty of occurrences have not required a variety of treatment. When fuch numbers of people arefaid to be fo eafily cured, it is rea~ fonable to conclude that the doffor muff polTefs great abilities, and the medicines irrefillible powers. But as I have not been fo fortunate as to be equally fuccefsful, and as every age ought certainly to profit by the ex- amples of its predeceftors, we mud of neceftity acknowledge either that the difeafes have loft their compliability, the medicines their powers, or that the fafts were not accurately ftated; I fufpeff the latter ; and if great numbers took the fame medicine and great numbers were fo fortunateas to recover, it is moft probable that very few were dangeroufly ill. 1 have heard of apothecaries who have been accuftomed always to keep the bark pot boiling; but this is a fubjefl that belongs to the commercial part of the profeftion, and on the prefent occafion it will be neceflary to diftin- guifh between the practice of phyfic and the fcience of medicine. I have given the bark in putrid difeafes with evidently good effe6ls, and have afterwards known the fever to increafe till the bark was inadmiflible; under fuch circumftances the plan of treatment has been varied for a few days, and the bark afterwards given with ftrongly marked advantage; but I have never yet met with an inftance where bark and wine, as fome have reprefented, would be given with fuccefs.

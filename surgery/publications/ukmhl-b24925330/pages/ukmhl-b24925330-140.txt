116 MORTIFICATION IN In inflammations of the bowels without hernia, purgative medicines may- be given with almofl unlimited freedom, but when this difeafeis the con- fequence of ftrangulated hernia, purgative medicines fhould be given with the greatefl: caution. When inflammation of the bowels without her- nia ends in mortification, death is the inevitable confequence; but in cafes of hernia it frequently happens that the difeafe is limited to the parts, that the integuments and contents of the hernia will all Hough away, and the patient afterwards recover. But if we examine the influence of cold applications in other kinds of mortification, on the bafis of Mr. I. Hunter’s own argument, we {hall not find the refult favourable to this new opinion. The progrefs and parti- cular period of the difeafe are certainly objects of great importance; the laft ftage of inflammation, immediately antecedent to mortification, we may fuppofe the mofl critical, and is the period that I fhould point out as mod proper for the examination of this queftion. At this time the vital acti- ons, which had been excited by inflammation far above the healthy ftan- dard, mud now be confidered as finking fall to that degree where all the vital powers muft ceafe. Warmth we are told increafes aflion, and if it is the bufinefs of the fur- geon by external means to fupport the finking powers till nature can be roufed by internal medicines to co-operate, we muft admit that warm ap- plications have the preference. Every obfervation that we meet with, and every argument that is brought forward in fupport of this new dodlrine, directly militates againft it.

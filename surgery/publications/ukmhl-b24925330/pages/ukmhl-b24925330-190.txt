166 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE, The fame Thing happened to a Jew whofe Sphacelus had got ground for three Weeks, in fpite of all means, where feveral Surgeons were con- cerned. “I have now ufed it in Seven Cafes the Circumftances in each being different, and yet in all the Bark has taken Effefl: Even within thefe few Days, to Mr. Delenor, who kept the Bagnio in St. James s Street, in whom a Mortification happened, after feveral punflures in Dropfical Legs, the Bark flopped the progrefs in lefs than twenty-four Hours, and the Sloughs began to feparate: but the patient having a Jaundice, and fpent with Evacuations, it revived and came into the other Leg; of which, though he died, yet the Power of the Bark was fo plain, that from this and the other Cafes, I think it evident, that we may be as fure of get- ting the better of, or at leafl of flopping a Mortification from an inter- nal Caufe by the Bark, as conquering an ague thereby.” The firfl of thefe cafes is faid to be a gangrene, after a phlegmon, which changed to a fphacelus, and was cured by the bark in twenty-four hours; the fecond is a fimilar cafe that continued for three weeks. If we look back to Mr, Sharp’s opinion, we {hall find that he particu- larly mentions fpreading gangrenes, as proper examples for determining the point in queflion ; but if this was a fpreading gangrene, its progrefs was very flow, as it lafled for three weeks before the bark was made ufe of. We are then informed that he had ufed the bark in feven cafes, and that of Mr. Delenor is added; but if we are to judge of the whole evidence by that before us, we fhall find it very difficult to form a fatisfa&ory opi- nion, or draw a rational conclufion.

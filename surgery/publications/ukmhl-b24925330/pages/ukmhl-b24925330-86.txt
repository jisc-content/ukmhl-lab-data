PHYSIOLOGY. 6 2 Whatever experiments Mr. I. Hunter may have made on this fubje6t, it is evident from his own confeflion, that he does not depend upon what be has feen in the microfcope, fo much as he Teems influenced by tire opi- nion of others. If he had ever examined the fubjeft experimentally, whe- ther the blood globules preferved their fpherical form on all oc< afions, or whether they ever became * elliptical by adapting themfeives to the fize of the veflels, as Tome have aflVrted ; he would not have exprefled himfelf in the language of doubt and uncertainty; he fhould have aflerted what he had Teen, and determined whether what had been faid before was right or wrong. He fays, “they are formed of an oval figure in Pome animals as authors have defcribedwhich evidently implies, that he was not provided with evidence either to confirm, or oppofe the aff rtion; but concludes by ob- ferving, that “this is probably an optical deceptionand this is the objeft that I have in view; for if Mr. I Hunter fufpe£hs an optical decep- tion in one inftance, we certainly have an equal right to fufpebt the whole. In the former page he fays, Malpighi miflook the globules of blood for globules of fat; from which we find that this invefligation began in error, and according to his own confeflion Leuwenhoek is not to be depended on; and if it is Mr. I Hunter’s opinion that thefe early obfervers pro- bably imagined more than they faw, it is evident that he was not faihfied With their experiments. * 1.

PHYSIOLOGY. 8/ In from the upper end weighed only two fcruples, fourteen grains and a half*** : Thus we find that the refult of this experiment is quite the reverfe of the former; in one the feftion of the upper end was one grain and a half heavier than that of the lower, in the fecond experiment the upper end was two grains lighter than the other. A third experiment was made, and we are told, that “the difference in weight between the upper and lower feftions was five grains,” but we are not informed which of the two had the advantage. “ Similar fe&ions from carotid arteries of a fwan being weighed, the lower feftion was found to be three grains and a half heavi- er than the upper; the lower fe&ion weighing thirteen grains and a half.” In this inftance the upper end was the fmaller, but we are not informed whether the carotid artery of a fwan gives off branches, and the number and fize fhould have been brought into the account. He then concludes with the following curious imagination; he fays, “ I imagine if the caro- tid artery in the camel did not fend off any branch in its courfe, it would increafe in fize nearly in the fame proportion with the umbilical artery, or the fpermatic in the bull. It is to be obferved, that as arteries divide they increafe in fize, much fafter than if they did noth.” Such is the hate of fa&s prefented to the public on this occafion, from which it muff appear that the form of the arteries has not yet been deter- mined, or at leaft that the queftion cannot be decided on Mr. I.

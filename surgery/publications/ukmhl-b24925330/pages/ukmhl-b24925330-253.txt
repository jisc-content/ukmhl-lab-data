Hunter’s plan of cold applications in cafes of mortification. But cold does not appear to be a remedy well calculated to revive the powers of life. In cafes of what is called fufpended animation, the application of exter- nal heat is recommended in a variety of forms; and in cafes of approach- ing mortification, where the vital powers are finking, is it not equally reafonabie to fuppofe that the cordial influence of reanimating warmth would prove a falutary application?

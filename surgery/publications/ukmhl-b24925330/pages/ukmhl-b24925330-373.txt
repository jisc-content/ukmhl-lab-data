PART OF SURGERY. 349 occafion it will be neceffary to connder, whether the operation ofextrac- tion will do more injury than letting the ball and other fubftances re- main. The importance of this bufinefs is in general greatly magnified, and confequently the danger is frequently increafed by operations that are unnecefTary : the firff quell ion that is afked on thefe occafions is, whether the ball has' been extiaded, as if the life of the patient depended alone on this Tingle circumfiance. Inflances do frequently occur where fmall quantities of extraneous matter will produce veiy diftrcffing fymp- toms ; but in cafes of gun flint wounds the dangerous confequences of the retention of the ball, &c. will depend on a variety of ctrcumftances, which it would be impofiible to enumerate. Wifeman Teems truly apprehenfive of the danger of adding one injury to another, and on this fubjed recommends the mod prudent caution ; and it is fcarcely poffible that the neceffity of early decifion fhould be more ftrongly recommended, where he fays, that “ after every fight the chirurgeons went together vifiting one another’s wounded men; and it was thought a great fhame if any of this work of extradion was then to be done.” 1 am willing to allow that -fince that day our knowledge of anatomy has been much improved, that many genera! laws of the animal ceconomy unknown at that period, have been fince invefligated : but it is e quaily evident that thefe furgeons had frequent opportunities of obferving the evidence of nature, and that they have faithfully recorded the fads which came before them.

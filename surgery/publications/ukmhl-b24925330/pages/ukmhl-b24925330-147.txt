THE EFFECTS OF BLEEDING# 123 fizy Bate of the blood cannot exifl independant of an inflammatory dif- eafe ; this flate of the blood is the confequence * and not the caufe of the difeafe. I have carefully attended to the progrefs of the inflammatory fymp- toms in cafes of aflive haemorrhage, and, being apprehenfive of the ap- proaching paroxyfm, have taken away a large bafon of blood, which has not (hewn the leafl appearance of flze; and 1 have frequently met with in- flances of this difeafe, where the haemorrhage has taken place in lefs than an hour after I had bled the patient. I have under thefe circumflances immediately repeated the bleeding, and found the blood taken by this fe- cond operation flrongly marked with fize; in many inflances I have found the returning haemorrhage, and the fizy flate of the blood, fo regularly accompany each other, as if the fizy flate of the blood was the immediate confequence of the difeharge. In the year 1768 f Doflor Heberden prefented fome queries on this fubjeft to the college of phyficians, which were publifhed in the medical tranfaflions in the year feventy-two. In the year feventy-one, Mr. Hew- fon publifhed his experimental inquiry into the properties of the blood; but neither of thefe great men has fatisfaflorily determined the point in queflion. Dr. Heberden fays, “the more we know of the human body, the more reafon we find to believe, that the feat of difeafes is not in the * Hewfon’s experimental inquiry, page 65. i Medical tranfa&ions, vol, 2. page 505* blood 5

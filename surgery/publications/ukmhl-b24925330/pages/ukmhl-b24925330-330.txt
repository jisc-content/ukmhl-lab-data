30 6 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. blood was flrongly marked with fize ; previous to the commencement of ervfrpelas, the patient had a chancre near the fraenum, and a venereal ul- cerated bubo ; in this flate he was attacked with eryfipelas, in confequencc of which the chancre and bubo both difappeared without any other re- medies being made ufe of, except thofe of the antiphlogiflic kind that were direfled for the inflammatory affeflion. It is now near two years fmce thefe circumllances took place, and the venereal fymptoms have not again made their appearance; but as I have known in fiances where the venereal difeafe has in this manner been fufpended, and not appeared for fome years afterwâ€™ards, it flill remains a doubtful queftion whether tins will prove a temporary fufpenfion or perfeft deflruclion of the difeafe ; and the fucceeding inflance will convince us of the uncertainty.

During the long progrefs of this acute difeafe, when the inflammatory fymptoms were moft formidable, he was bled nine times, to about the amount of fixteen or twemy ounces each ; but bleeding wras not the only remedy that was made ufe of, and I have mentioned the number of times that he was bled more for the purpofe of giving an idea of the degree of inflammatory affedlion, than with any intent of entering into a minute detail of the method of treatment.

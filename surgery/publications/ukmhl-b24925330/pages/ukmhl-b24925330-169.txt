It is not neceffary that I fhould demonftrate the efficacy of bleeding in the arm in all cafes of true inflammatory difeafe; i i a fubjefl fuffici- ently eftablifhed on the authority of indifputable faffs, and the evidence of experience; and if topical bleeding had been found by the fame evi- dence o( fuperior efficacy, it would certainly by this time have become the general praffice, and bleeding in the arm have loft its reputation. Whatever was written in favour of topical bleeding, before the time of Harvey, muft fink under the difcovery of the circulation ; and all the fub- fequent arguments that I have met with feem to have been formed with- out any attention to the mechanifm of the vafcular fyftem, as much fo, as if the animal body was confidered fimilar to a fponge, and the blood paf- fed from one part to another by inorganic pores, O o But M

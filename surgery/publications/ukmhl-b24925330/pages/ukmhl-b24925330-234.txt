CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. 210 the obje&s of the Surgeon’s choice. In the gout combed wool is frequent- ly recommended, as a Soft, warm, and rather oily application. In eryfi- pelas, the parts are fometimes dufled with fine flour. I well remember an anecdote of a facetious phyfician obtaining wonderful applaufe by duff- ing a Lady’s face all over with hair-powder. And I once knew an inflance where the powder of bark was prescribed as an application in this difeafe; and when the Gentleman (who was of Scotch extraftion) afked for an ex- planation, the Doftor replied, that the Scotch always ufed oatmeal on fuch occafions, but that he preferred bark, as it Served as a protection a- gainft the danger of mortification. Good God! exclaimed the aftonifhed patient, whofe Solicitous attention did not permit a Single word to paSs unnoticed; I hope. Said he, you do not See any reaSon for Such apprehen- sions; to which the DoCtor anfwered in the negative, but obferved, that it was Sometimes prudent to be upon our guard. It is now Some years fince this circumftance happened, but as it appear- ed to be a curious method of pra&ice, I muft acknowledge that it made a lafhng impreflion on my mind. If the application of powder of bark in cafes of eryfipelas is innocent and inefficacious, it may without doubt anfwer the purpofe as well as oatmeal, wheat flour, or hair-powder; but if in fuch cafes it is made ufe of on account of its Stimulating powers, as a tonic or antifeptic, it certainly muff be improper in an inflammatory difeafe. And here it may be neceffary to obferve, that the prevention and cure of mortification are two diftinCt indications and confequently require very different remedies. I have Seen fraffured limbs laid in comb- ed wool, which is perhaps one of the mo ft innocent applications that can be made ufe of, and innocence is a virtue in Surgery that merits our atten- tion. If

THE OPERATIVE The fame rule will here become applicable that fhould regulate our conduct in every department of forgery, not to add injury to a part al- ready under the influence of difeafe. It is a law that fhould be held fa- cred, and merits our attention on every occafion from the drawing of a tooth to the amputation of a limb. I cannot fay that I ever met with an inflance of fpreading gangrene having taken place in confequence of drawing a tooth ; but I have known very extenfive inflammation, abfcefs, and lofs of fubflance immediately fucceed this violent operation, when the parts were rendered acutely fenfibleby previous difeafe. If a tumour is opened by incifion before the inflammation has termi- nated in fuppuration, additional inflammation is certain to take place. It is not my intention to afleri that it is always neceflfary that all gun-fhot wounds fhould be opened immediately, or that at all events it is abfo- lutely neceflary that the ball and other fubflances fhould be extrafled ; I only wifh to be underflood that, whatever operation of this kind is thought neceflary, it muff either be done before inflammation has taken place, or after it has fubfided. Mr. I. Hunter feems to infinuate, that it has been a common pra&ice to enlarge gun-fhot wounds with the knife on all occafions, independent of any views of extrafling the ball and other fubflances. If fuch ever was the general practice, it was certainly right to point out the impropriety; but for the honour of the profeflion I fhould hope the contrary; and as Mr. I. Hunter was under the neceflity of exercifing his imagination for the purpofe of finding a cafe in point, we may reafonably conclude that it was an error in praflice which he had no right to complain of; lor, if this had

THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE 4 will prove equally inftruftive to many others, as it has effeftually proteC- ed me from that blind credulity, with which I might otherwife have peru- fed this celebrated performance. Whether we are molt indebted to the ancients or moderns is a queftion left undetermined; our learned author either feems difpofed to pleafe both parties, or perhaps was not himfelf fufficiently informed to give a decided opinion on the fubjeC. It is rather an unpleafant talk to examine a book where there is fo lit- tle to approve, but I (hall not facrifice the falutary objeft I have in view to motives of falfe delicacy; it is my wifh to examine the prefent hate of this fubjeC, and if the public opinion bears any refemblance to that before us, or if we only meet with a few inftances of coincidence, it is dill necef- farythat thefe imperfeCions fhould be explained. The preceding example of our author’s ftyle, and manner of conduc- ing an argument will be fufficient for our prefent purpofe; I fhall there- fore now proceed to examine his obfervations on mortifications. He fays “It is well known, that whenever any part has had the leajl tendency to mortification, the bark has, of late years, been indiferiminately given in very large quantities, as the only fpecific to flop its progrefs; and fo fan- guine are many in this prejudice, that they do not believe any mifehief can pofiibly enfue from the ufe of this medicine*.” The conclufion of this fentence appears to intimate fome kind of danger that is not general- ly underftood, and may be fuppofed to depend either on the impropriety of this medicine as a remedy in fuch cafes, or the want of abilities to dif- criminate in what manner, and at what period of the difeafe, it ought to be adminiftered. * See Mr. Bromfeild's chirurgical cafes page 129.

313 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. I have feledled thefe few inRances for the purpofe of illuRrating the effedls of the digitalis under different circumRances; if I was to give a defcription of every cafe 1 have met with, they muff in many inRances prove a repetition of the fame thing; and it is not neceffary to produce a multiplicity of evidence in fupport of fadls that are fo Rrongly charac- terized, or of experiments that may be fo readily repeated. It is not a medicine whofe influence is obfcure, or whofe effefts are doubtful ; but wherever the digitalis is introduced in pradlice, its powers muffbe known to all who'are capable of making obfervations. I carmot conclude this defcription of the effe&s of the digitalis without expreffmg my aRonifhment that a medicine, poffeffed of fuch powers, fhould have been unknown to Doftor Zimmerman, at the time he was called upon to attend the late King of Pruffia. If he had been acquainted with the progrefs of the fcience of medicine in Great Britain, he certainly would not have limited his prefcriptions to the juice of dandelion, which his auguR patient fo juRly termed a. fiddle jaddle medicine. But, ani- mated with the heroifm of the immortal Frederic, he would have direc- ted the powers of medicine to the conqueR of difeafe with the fame probability of fuccefs that the monarch had been accuRomed to condudf his viftorious armies through the field ; and, infiead of lamenting the want of medicinal agency, or of trembling at the confcioufnefs of his inability to give relief, he would with confidence have explained his in- tended operations, and recommended his prefcription by the moR rati- onal affurances of the fpeedy good effedls, and might with propriety have promifed an alleviation of the oppreffive fymptoms ; which would certainly have been confidered, for the time, a conqueR of the difeafe. 4 FI He

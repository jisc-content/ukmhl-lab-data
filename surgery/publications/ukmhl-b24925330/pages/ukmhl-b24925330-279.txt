MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 255 the falutary influence did not fo much depend upon the quantity that was taken in a given time, as it did on the critical period when it was firft made ufe of.

But, when a cafe becomes fo truely defperate, every experiment muft be confidered juflifiable; and as our knowledge of the fubjeft will be at bell imperfeft, and as there is always a poflibility of forming an inaccurate or erroneous opinion, it certainly would be highly criminal for the fur- geon to betray his truft, and leave the patient to his fate, by deferring his poll in a paroxyfm of defpair.

THE OPERATIVE his life ; or if the fird inflammation is fuch as is likely to go off, accord- ing to the lad dated cafe, then we fhould allow it to go off before we operate, and not run the rifle of producing death by an operation; for I have already obferved, few can fupport the confequences of the lofs of a lower extremity when in full health and vigour: we know that a vio- lent inflammation will in a few hours alter the healthy difpofition, and give a turn to the conditution, efpecially if a confiderable quantity of blood has been lod, which mod probably m ill be the cafe where both accident and operation immediately fucceed one another*.” It is much to be lamented that this datement is not given in plain terms, and the circumdances more accurately explained; for my own part I cannot form any idea of a cafe where the lofs of the limb is ulti- mately certain, in which the fcience of furgery can in the brd indance determine that il e life of il e patient is in a date of fafetv. The mod important danger under fuch circumdances is m -rtification, and if mor- tification once takes p!a^e, it is impodible foi an) one to determine where or unen that wiil terminate. But Mr. T. Hunter never mentions mortification ; it is inflammation alone which in this chapter is the fubjeft of his conflderation. Inflamma- tion is certainly one of the fbfl confequences of external injury; but if inflammation does not end in mortification it will not prove mortal, and confequently this limitation of his obfervations to the inflammatory part of the difeafe appears to me to be a new refinement of Mr. I. Hunter’s, which I am not able to explain. * I. Hunter on Gun-fhot Wounds, page 560. But

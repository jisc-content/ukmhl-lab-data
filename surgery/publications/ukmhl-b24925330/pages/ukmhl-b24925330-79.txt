PHYSIOLOGY. 55 pofe of demonftrating the imperfe£Hons of this branch of phyfiology, I fhould not have brought them forward on this occafion. In one place he fays, “that the ferum is greateft in quantity, when the blood globules are mod abundant*.” This appears to me to be a curious obfervation; and though it may pafs unnoticed by the inattentive, I think it is well worthy of our confideration. In the firft place we muft admit, that it is difficult to afcertain the number of red globules in any given quantity of blood; and, if we cannot afcertain the number, we cannot eftimate the quantity. But independent of this difficulty, as the quantity of ferum is fa id- to increafe in proportion to the quantity of red globules, the argument im- plies a contradi6lion in itfelf; for if the increafe is equal, the proportion muft remain the fame. On another occafton, fpeaking of the difeafed ftate of the valves of the aorta,he fays: “It muft have begun much earlier in life than fuch dif- eafes commonly do, as the fymptoms appeared when he was youngh;” and then in a marginal note, adds, “T have feen it at. a very early period.” This is in the firft inftance infinuating that this difeafe does not take place at an early period, and then immediately admitting that he has feen the contrary; it is giving an opinion in the face of his own evidence; he firft ftates an opinion, and then brings fa£ts to prove the contrary. I fhall only trouble the reader with two more examples of this fpecies * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 36, i I. Hunter on gun-fliot wounds, page, 58, I H ' Of

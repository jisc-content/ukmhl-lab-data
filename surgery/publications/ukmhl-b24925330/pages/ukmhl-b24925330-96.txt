72 PHYSIOLOGY* the left ventricle of the heart from which they originate, but this will not be found to depend on any diverfity of involuntary or voluntary aftion ; the aftion of the heart and arteries are certainly both involuntary, and are both regulated by fimilar principles. In this inflance the aflion of the arteries is fuppofed to be mufcular, and no notice is taken of their elafti- city; at the fame time that every argument, which blind enthuliafm could devife, is brought forward to prove, that the contraction of the arteries depends on the co-operation* of elafticity, and mufcular a£lion. This union of powers is faidto produ re moll wonderful effefls; they not only contrafl the arteries, but alfo diflend thernt; but thefe aflions do not preferve a general uniformity; for in one place we are told that the arteries are diftended by the power of the heart, and contracted by elaf- ticity, aflifled by mufcular aCtion; but in the very next line J the contrac- ted Hate of the arteries is faid to arife from the aCtion of their mufcular power. We are alfo informed that the arteries are § elongated by their mufcular power. I have thought neceffary to notice Tome of the moll im- portant parts of thisembarralfedreprefentation, as the circumflances, which gave rife to thefe conjectures, will in fome degree contribute to illullrate this part of the fubjebl. * I.

AMPUTATION. 40 on to the contrary, he is certainly a zealous advocate on the wrong fide of the queflion, and in favour of that opinion which he is unable to fupport. The ambiguity of the conclufion ferves to elucidate the bias of our au- thor's opinion ; and to determine the validity of his arguments, he fays, ‘e if the operation is performed while mortification is advancing, the difeafe fcarcely ever fails of feizing the flump,5’ and immediately adds, “at leaf! 1 never knew an inflance to the contrary.” Why then fliould he obferve that the difeafe fcarcely ever fails of feizing the flump, when he immediately acknowledges that he never knew an in- flance to the contrary; the expreffion mull certainly imply that the difeafe does fomerimes fail of feizing the flump, and this is all that would be ne- ceffary to juflify the praflice ; for in cafes fo defperate where the hazard is fo great, if in a few inflances the patient efcapes with life, we then mult admit that the praflice is not irrational.

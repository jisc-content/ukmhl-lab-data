8o PHYSIOLOGY, He fays, “figure the firft fhews the artery in its fyftole, with the three valves, nearly clofe to its hides. The two black dots are defigned to re- prefent the mouths of the coronary arteries now covered by the valves*.” This defcription is too clear to admit of ambiguity, the aorta is in its fyftole, and the valves wide open. Let us here recoiled what is the rela- tive flate of the left ventricle of the heart, and the arterial fyftem. The very inftant that the fyftole of the left ventricle ceafes, the fyftole of the arteries takes place; and if the valves of the aorta did not clofe the inllant that the fyftole of the arteries commences, the blood would be returned from the artery into the left ventricle; fo that it is impoftible that the valves fhould continue in the ftate here defcribed, during the fyftole of the artery; and if it is remembered that a complete pulfation is performed in Iefs than a fecond of time, we fhall be convinced that the doling of the valves is a'very expeditious operation: forfhort as the interval of time may be from the termination of the fyftole of the left ventricle to the commencement of the fyftole of the arteries, in that fhort interval the valves muft either clofe, or part of the contents of the aorta be returned into the heart. And the diftrefs, which is occafioned by the imperfed adion of the valves in confequence of oflification, and which was fo particularly ex- perienced by Mr. I. Hunter in his own perfon, gives us reafon to conclude, that the operation of thefe valves is in general performed with perfed ac- curacy and effed. ? I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 161, Mr*

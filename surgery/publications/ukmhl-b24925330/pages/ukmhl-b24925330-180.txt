156 ' TOPICAL BLEEDING. ' « tity is larger when taken very gradually, the effe6l is not inflantaneous or great in proportion to the quantity. There is no doubt but the lofs of a pound or two of blood will have con- hderable effeft on the conftitution, whether it be taken by the lancet or by any other method; what I contend for is, that its effefts mud be ge- neral, and not limited to the part from which it is taken. The effects of this operation will depend principally on the quantity that is taken away, and the expedition with which the blood is evacuated; as the falutary in- fluence of every kind of bleeding, in inflammatory difeafes, will be regu- lated by thefe circumftances, and, for this purpofe, the lancet is the only inflrument by which thefe important objefls can be accomplifhed. But fo long as topical bleeding may ferve to decorate a phyfician’s pre- fcription, toamufe the patient, or impofe upon his friends, to procure a fee to the furgeon, or add a charge to the apothecary’s bill, it is certain to be fupported, in oppofition to all the arguments that reafon or philofophy may advance againfi: it. l SECTION

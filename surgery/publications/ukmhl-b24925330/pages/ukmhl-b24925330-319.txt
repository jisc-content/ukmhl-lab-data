MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 235 It When the inflammatory diathefis is deftroyed. Debtor Gregoryâ€™s fccond objebt is to takeoff determination to the lungs ; this part of the fubjebt appears to me in Tome refpcbts unintelligible, and I mud acknowledge 1 am not acquainted with any medicine, except the digitalis, that feeins to coincide with this indication, and this medicine at that day was not in life; fo that I cannot fay that 1 perfectly underhand either this repre- sentation of the difeafe or method of cure. When the inflammatory diathefis is deftroyed, the next objebt in my opinion is to correbt the formation of purulent matter in the lungs. For, in cafes where a purulent expectoration has taken'place, if the difcharge is only produced by an inflammation of the internal furfaceof the ramifi- cations of the bronchia, without any ulceration or Iofs of fubftance, if the inflammatory diathefis can be deftroyed, it is probable that the cure of the remaining part of the difeafe will in general be readily accomplifhed. But if ulceration has taken place, it is reafonable to fuppofe that the difficulty of cure at this period of the difeafe will depend in fome meafure on the degree and extent of the ulceration. But whether the expebtoration proceeded from a fecreting furface or from ulceration, the indications are the fame ; the firfi object is to defiroy the morbid adtion of the fyftem, the fecond to prevent the difcharge ; and as the digitalis is the moft powerful remedy we are provided wiih on this occafion, not a doubt remains in my mind refpedting the propriety of giv- ing the digitalis, as foon as the inflammatory diathefis is deftroyed. The Iofs of fubftance in the lungs does not always render the difeafe incurable, as it fometimes happens that the burfling of a vomica will lay the foun- dation for a fpeedy recovery.

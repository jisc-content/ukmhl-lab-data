PHYSIOLOGY. ?0! ' The The experiments made many years ago by *Dr. Hales, by fixing glafs tubes into the carotid arteries of living animals, are more fimple, and much better calculated to (hew the power of the heart and arteries; but, after all, if we could meafure the power of the heart and arteries, and the velocity of the circulating fluids with the greateft accuracy. Hill this is on- ly one fingle part of a very complicated piece of mechanifm, that will at mod be imperfeftly underftood; and except we could trace the progrefs of the blood to and through the circumference of the circulation, this par- tial operation of its central power would contribute very little to our knowledge of the animal oeconomy, either in a ftate of health or under the influence of difeafe. For my own part, I have no opinion of this mutilated evidence of dif- torted nature; but it is pofliblethat thefe arguments may appear of more importance to others than they do to me, and confequently merit our at- tention. As the fphin&er mufcles are circular, their mode of aftion is fuppofed to refemble the contractile power of an artery : but the fphinc- ter mufcles are fubjeCt to the dictates of volition, and in the defcription of this fpecies ofmufcular aCtion we meet with many inaccuracies. In one place, +contraCiion is faid to be the natural operation of the mufcular power; in another we are informed, that the aClion of the fphinc- ter mufcles is both J voluntary, and involuntary, and that relaxation is a- nother fpecies of mufcular aftion, and that this is involuntary. * Hales ftatical cffays, vol. 2, page 40. â€¢f-1.

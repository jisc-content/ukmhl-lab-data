PHYSIOLOGY. 94 am ftill of opinion that the power of the heart does extend to the utmofi; limits of the whole arterial fyftem. How the arteries terminate, or how the veins begin, are queftions of ve- ry difficult inveftigation; it is a point beyond the reach of inje6lions, and compofed of parts too fine for the differing knife to divide. And when we confider that every part of the body is fupplied with blood veffels whofe number, if not infinite, is fo great as to exceed the multiplication of ideas; we ffiall then ceafe to wonder that the microfcope ffiould repre- fent this fubje6l as a fyftem of confufion. It is to analogy alone that we muft appeal, and form our judgment by comparing the fmall and great together. I ffiall not here revive the warm controverfy that took place between the Hunters and Monroes refpefting the abforbent fyftem; but if the motion of the blood in the veins does not depend on the power of the heart, it certainly muft depend upon fome other caufe; and I know of no animal fun6tion but abforption which is adapted to this purpofe. That the veins are more numerous than the arteries, is a fa6i that ap- pears felf-evident; and in favour of which, we have the concurring tef- timony of the author before us. *If then the veins are more numerous than * <c There is a greater number of trunks of veins in the body, than of arteries, at leaft vifible veins: for wherever there is an artery, in common there is a vein ; and in many places two, one on each fide, which fometimes makes a kind of plexus round it; befides, there are many veins where there are no correfponding arteries, as on the furface of the body; for in the extremities many of the larger veins pafs fuperficially ; but thofe become fewer and fewer towards the trunk of the body.

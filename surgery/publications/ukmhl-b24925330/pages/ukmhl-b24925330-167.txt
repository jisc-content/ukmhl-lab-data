The temporal artery is a branch of the external carotid, which fupplies the external parts of the head with blood; the internal may be con- fidered as a correfponding branch that conveys the blood to the internal parts of the head, and ramifies through the brain. Thefe two branches differ in dimenfions ; and, in a ftate of health, the quantity of blood fent to each will be in proportion to their refpe6tive diameters. Now let us confider what will be the confequence of opening a branch of the external divifion; if the refiftance to the progrefs of the blood be not diminifhed by opening the temporal artery, the diftribution to the different veffels will continue the fame, but if the refiftance to the progrefs of the blood be diminifhed, the increafed fupply of blood to the external carotid will be in fuch proportion, that the increafed velocity may correfpond in an inverfe ratio with the diminifhed refiftance. But the moft important queftion is, from whence mufl this increafe of quantity proceed, and whether the diftribution to the internal carotid will be dimi- nifhed in proportion as the fupply to the external is increafed. We muft here recolleft, that, according to a well known Jaw in hydrof- tatics, fluids prefs equally in all dire&ions; and, confequently, their diftribution cannot be partial; the quantity that paffes the internal caro* tid

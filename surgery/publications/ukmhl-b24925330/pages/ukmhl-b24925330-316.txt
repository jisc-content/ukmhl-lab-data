The digitalis will in many inllances fink the pulfe both in velocity and power; but it is not an antiphlogiftic, it will not deftroy inflammation. This will lead us to one of the molt curious circumflances which I have had an opportunity of obferving refpedling the powers of this medicine, and will ferve to illuftrate one of the laws of the animal ceconomy that defervedly merits our attention. I am well convinced, by the evidence of faÂ£ls and repeated obfervation, that the digitalis will fufpend a phlo- giftic diathefis, but will not deftroy it. I have given the digitalis for a month together in a phlogiftic difeafc, and by that means reduced the pulfe from one hundred and twenty to fixty, and by regular uninterrupted perfeverance have limited the pulfe to that reduced ftate for a month together ; yet it was evident that the difeafe was not deftroyed ; for I have feen inftances where the difeafe has been fo far fufpended as not to exhibit a ftngle fymptom, and then in a few hours to overcome the powers of the medicine ; and thus having obtained the fuperiority, the morbid adlion has again appeared in full force, and the influence of the medicine funk into obfeurity. Under thefe circumflances, if the inflammatory fymptoras have been abated by copious bleeding and other antiphlogiftic remedies, fo as to reduce the difeafe to fuch a degree that the powers of the digitalis ftill retained in the conflitution fhould regain their fuperiorty, the medicine will then refume its influence ; and though the difeafe is not completely deftroyed

INFLAMMATION AND 122 caution; for if bleeding is carried too far, the inflammatory fymptoms and the energy of the fyflem will both fink together, and the rapidity of the approaching mortification be increafed in fomeproportioncorrefpond- ing to the preceding evacuations. Inflammation of the extremities from external injury may produce mortification. And inflammation may take place in any of the contents of the belly, in confequence of external injury; and this is alfo equally liable to end in mortification; but flill there is a material difference in thefe two fpecies of difeafe; in the former, the blood will not be fizy, and bleed- ing will fink the vital powers, inflead of deflroying the difeafe; whereas, in the latter inflance, the blood will be fizy, and very copious bleeding will be neceffary, and is on this occafion a very important and certainly efficacious remedy. For the fake of diflin£lion, the firfi cafe may be con- lidered local inflammation, and the increafed a£lion fyflematic fever; whereas the latter is not only an inflammation of the vifcera, but alfo a general inflammation of the fyflem. Inmanyinflances of fever, where the pulfeishard andfull, afingle bleed- ing may be made ufe of with advantage, merely to corredl the plethoric Hate of the fyflem, but can feldom be repeated with fafety. It is in true inflammatory difeafes that bleeding is fo particularly efficacious ; in fim- ple fever and in many other cafes, where it is indifcriminately made ufe of, it can only be looked upon as a doubtful auxiliary; but in true in- flammation it is a fpecific antidote. It is only in thofe difeafes that pro- duce a fizy flate of the blood that bleeding is fo particularly falutary; an inflammatory difeafe may exifl without a fizy flate of the blood, but a

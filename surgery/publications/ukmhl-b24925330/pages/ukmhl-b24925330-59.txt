35 AMPUTATION, but with refpeft to the former, even thefe only affeft to confider it unne- ceffary, fufpend their affeflation and then they profefs a contrary opinion. On the prefent occafion it is not the manner of introdu&ion which is the objeft of our attention; it is neither the inaccuracy of defcription nor the ambiguity of fi&ion that we are now attempting to inveftigate; it is not the manner of reprefentation, but the real merits of the argument that engages our attention; and if we allow them to preferve their affe&ation, even then thefe imaginary charaflers will not anfwer the intended pur- pofe for which Mr. Bell created them. The argument then fets forth that all inferior degrees of mortification may be cured without amputation, and confequently this operation in fuch cafes cannot be neceffary; in the firft place it is much to be lamented that thefe degrees of difeafe were not pointed out, and the method of treatment accurately explained, for in all fuch cafes where there is a pro- bability of cure the queftion ceafes; we are not contending in favour of the removal of limbs in cafes of curable gangrene, the queftion is, how far amputation may be confidered a fafe and efficacious remedy where the difeafe is confiderable in degree, rapid in its progrefs, and dangerous in its confequences.

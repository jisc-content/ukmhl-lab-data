CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. 213 without a repetition of dreftings. I have frequently in compound frac- tures feen the experiment tried with fuccefs, and have known the fame applications continued till the wound was completely healed; and have met with feveral inftances, where this method was attended with the mod unqueftionable advantages. I know this is a method recommended by Sir James Earle*, and Ido not recollect any other inftance where this prac- tice has made its appearance in print. But I am proud of the prefent opportunity of paying this tribute of refpeff to the memory of my friend, under whofe care I received my firft inPtruffions; as this was a plan of treatment which he purfued with considerable enthufiafm, more than thir- ty years ago. It is now above feven and twenty years fince the firft inftance occurred that I was witnefs to; it was a fraflure of the leg, by the {haft of a load- ed cart falling upon it; the fuperior part of the tibia made its way through the Skin, about the middle of the leg. After the fraflure was reduced, the wound was covered with a plaifter of fome mild ointment fpread upon lint; and the limb was Surrounded with what is called an eighteen tailed bandage; and the dreftings were not removed for the firft fortnight. When the parts were again examined, the wound was found nearly clo- fed, dry lint was then applied, and the whole covered with a plaifter ban- dage; at the end of another fortnight the parts were again examined, and the applications renewed, when the wound was found completely healed. I fhail not prefume to comment on this cafe, as it happened at a time when my judgment was premature; but the faffs may be depended upon * Fottâ€™s works, by Earle, 1790. G g g as

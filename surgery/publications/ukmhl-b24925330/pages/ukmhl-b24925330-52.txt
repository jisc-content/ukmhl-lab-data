THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION 24, He mentions having given the bark in the largeft quantities and com- bined with a variety of other medicines, but opium is not noticed as one of them. For my own part I find it difficult to account for this omifhon, as it has been recommended by other writers, and from its well known pow- ers as a cordial, would certainly have been a proper fubjeff for his expe- rimental enquiries. Mr. Bromfeild % whofe chirurgical obfervations were publifhed a very few years before thefe of Mr. Pott’s, particularly recommends the ufe of bark with the addition of opium; but in the inftance before us, the ufe of opium was not direfted by the di&ates of attentive reading, or the infor- mation acquired by extenfive pra&ice, it was not the refult either of fpe- culative ingenuity, or rational inference, on the contrary the whole was accidental. This was the firft fuccefsful cafe he ever met with, the event was unex- pected, and the occurence new; previous to this difcovery it is reafonable to fuppofe, that after fo many years of fatal experience, he muff have con- cluded either that the difeafe was incurable, that the remedies he made ufe of were inadequate to the purpofe, or have doubted the propriety of the whole method of treatment. From this period we mufl date the diftin&ion between the two difeafes, till when every mortification was confidered fimilar in its nature, and one method of treatment was applicable to all, fBromfeild’s chirurgical obfervations vol x, page 132.

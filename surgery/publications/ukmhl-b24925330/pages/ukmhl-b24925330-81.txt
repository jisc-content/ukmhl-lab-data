57 PHYSIOLOGY. I am at a lofs to conjecture; or why any one fhould endeavour to oppofe that evidence which appears moft fatisfaftory. We are not fufficiently acquainted with the mechanifm of animal life, to enable us to form clear ideas of the ufeand properties of the different parts of the blood; and I fear that the obfervations before us will not refleCl any additional light on this fubjeCt. He acknowledges that refpiration is an important animal funCtion, and alfo mentions that the colour of the blood is changed by paffing through the lungs; and this is reprefented as an objeCt deferving our attention. But flill he contends, that * refpiration muft produce fome other effeCl flill more important; for he fays, “if we fuppofe the.change of colour in the red globules to be all that refpiration is to perform, we fhall make the red globules the moft eftential part of the blood, whereas they are leaft fo.,J But this is a fubjeCt that, in my opinion, does not admit of degrees; as all parts, that are effential to the life of an animal, muft be conftdered of equal importance. The evidence here brought forward clearly proves the importance of the red part of the blood in the more perfeCt animals; but an attempt is made to fuperfede the authority of this evidence, by the introduction of a fuppofition that refpiration produces fome other effeCts, which the fupe- rior abilities of this anatomift have not yet been able to difcover; and re« fpe&ing which his ingenuity has not even formed a plaufible conjeCture, and all this for the important purpofe of fupporting a whimfical opinion^ and * I.

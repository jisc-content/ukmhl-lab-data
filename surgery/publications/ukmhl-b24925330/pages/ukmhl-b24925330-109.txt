85 PHYSIOLOGY, The firft opinion that was formed on this fubjeH was that the arterial tubes were of a conical figure, diminifhing in diameter as they proceeded from their origination; in fome few inftances Haller fufpefted that they were cylindrical; but fince that time I was of opinion that modern anat- omy had decided the queftion; and determined that all the arterial tubes preferved the fame diameter, except where they gave off additional ramifi- cations. But on this fubjeft I believe we have no written evidence to ap- peal to, and confequently we are under the receffity of admitting Mr, I. Hunter’s opinion as a modern flandard. If on this occafion we meet with fatisfaffory evidence to. prove that the arterial fyftem is compofed either of cones or cylinders or of a mifcella- neous alfemblage of both, it will be in vain to oppofe fpeculative argu- ment againft plain matter of fa£l; but if, on the contrary, the experiments and obfervations fhould appear imperfeH, I fhall then confider the fub- je6I open to additional difcuffion, and claim the privilege of defending my own opinion. Mr. I. Hunter fuppofes that “the arterial tubes are fome conical and fome cylindrical*,” but does not point out whether the large arteries are cones, and the fmall ones cylinders; or whether the fmall ones are cylin- ders and the larger cones. He inje&ed the carotid artery of a camel, and weighed two equal por- tions from each end of the artery after it was filled with inje&ion, and * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 169, Y found

97 PHYSIOLOGY. tranfmit the blood forwards, until the diftention and progreflive power of its contents are fuperior to the refinance of the anterior column, whofe preffure (huts the valves. And thus the valves do not promote the pro- grefs of the blood, they only ferve as partial interpofitions to prevent its return. It has been before obferved, that the arterial fyftem preferves an equi- librium throughout the whole; but in the venous fyftem the equilibrium of aÂ£Hon is not fo perfeft; partial preffure from a variety of accidental caufes may impede the progrefs of the contents of the veins; but when the mufcles are at reft, whether the body is in an ereft or horizontal po- lition, the blood willmove from every partof the circumferenceto thecen- tre with equal velocity and power, the valves of the veins will float at eafe, and neither increafe nor diminifh the pafting ftrearn. It is the bufinefs of the valves to prevent irregularities taking place, and not to promote or dire6t the progrefs of the blood; they only ferve as fentinels to preferve order and not as aftive agents. The aftive part of the venous fyftem is limited to the extremities of their branches ; and the venous tubes ferve only as paflive condu&ors to convey the blood from the circumference to the heart. But it has already been fliewn, by a multiplicity of evidence, that the contraftion of the veins is much inferior to that of the arteries; fo much fo that under a variety of circumftancesthe venous fyftem becomes fo much expanded, as to receive the whole mafs of blood ; fo that the two cava ferve as refervoirs to fupply the heart.

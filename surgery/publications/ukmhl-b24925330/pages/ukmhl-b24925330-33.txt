5 TREATMENT OF MORTIFICATION* In the firft inftance an early flage is particularly alluded to, by the leaft tendency being printed in italics, as if it was intended to command our par- ticular attention, yet, notwithftanding all this typographical illuflration, the general meaning dill remains obfcure; for if by tendency to mortifi- cation, we are to underdand that the difeafe, whether the confcquence of external injury or from any other caufe, is inflammation, and of that de- gree that there is reafon to apprehend a mortification; if the bark fhould be given under fitch circumdances, it would certainly be improper: and if by tendency to mortification, that date of difeafe is alluded to, when the inflammatory fymptoms begin to fubfide, and the powers of nature to fink below that dandard, which is neceffary to the fupport of animal life, on this occafion the bark will be pointedly indicated; and confequently eve- ry infinuation to the contrary, mud be confidered highly irrational. If then for want of difcriminating between thefe two very different fla- ges of difeafe, the bark is fometimes given as a preventative of mortifica- tion (that is before it does take place,) and at other times as a cure for mortification (viz. when it has taken place;) then, without doubt, the bark with drift propriety may be faid to be given indifcriminately. In the fird indance our attention is direftedto a very early flage of the difeafe; but we have then to reconcile the lead tendency to mortification with the real exidence of the difeafe; for as the bark is faid to be given “as the only fpecific to flop the progrefs of mortification,” this is fully ad- mitting the mortification to have taken place; as it mud neceffarily exid before we can Ipeak with propriety of flopping its progrefs; the two pe- riods are each didinftly mentioned in the fame fentence, and the ufe of the bark in both indances reprefented as a vulgar prejudice, C Though

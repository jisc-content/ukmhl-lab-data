155 TOPICAL BLEEDING# tbat the opinion he has given on this fubjeff appears to me to be a libel on the profeffion'*. But whether the difficulties are real or imaginary, if leech- es are made ufe of as a fubftitute for the lancet, it is the general effeft of the evacuation on the fyftem that produces the falutary confequences and not their topical application. This method of bleeding is fuppofed by fome to be ufeful under a variety of circumftances ; in cafes of hemorr- hoidal varix it is frequently recommended, and I ffiall not on this occa- fion prefume to doubt that it may fometimes prove a convenient applica- tion. But all thefe inftances are unconnefled with the the theory of topical bleeding. I have frequently bled children with leeches till they have fainted, and have continued the evacuation in adults for feveral hours until the quan- tity has been very considerable, and produced evident effe61s on the con- ftitution. It would be impoffible to afcertain the lofs of blood in fuch in- fiances, but as the evacuation is flow, it is probable that the patient would bear a greater lofs by this method than that by the lancet; but if the quan- * “Blood-letting, whether we confider it as to its influence on the fyftem, or with refpett to the nicenefs and even difficulty of the mode ufually employed for effe&ing it, is perhaps one of the mod important operations in furgery. From its being fo frequently-put in praftice, and from every pre- tender to any knowledge in the healing art being able to perform it without any apparent difficulty, the public have been induced to confider it as trivial with rcfpetl to its execution; but every prac- titioner of chara&er mull acknowledge, that, in order to perform this operation properly, the greeted: nicety, fteadinefs, and exa&nefs, are neceflary. All the other operations in furgery I have frequent- ly feen well performed ; but I can with freedom fay, that I have feldom feen blood-letting with the lancet done very correftly : When properly performed it is really a neat operation ; but when not done with exaftnefs, it is the very reverfe.” Bell’s fyftem of furgery, page 77 and 78. tity

*95 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. bat thefe Things want to be ftill farther confidered by Phyficians. Be- Tides, from the above-mentioned Hiftories it is worth obferving, that tho’ in fome of them the Wounds were the immediate Caufe of a Gangrene, yet that in all of them, the chief and principal Caufe feems to be taken from the State and Condition of the Humours, and confequently, that in- ternal Remedies rather than the ufual external ones, anfwered the Fur- pofe with greater Difpatch and Safety-*.” If we view thefe two cafes merely as fimple fafts, without examining the particulars; the firft in which the bark was given without fuccefs, proves that in this inftance the powers of the remedy were inadequate to the influence of the difeafe. If then in the fecond inftance the patient re- covered, as the bark was given in both, it would be reafonable to conclude, that the fuccefs depended on other caufes: but as the firft cafe is that kind of difeafe, in which Mr. Pott afferts that the bark is not efficacious; this cafe might be confidered as evidence in favour of his opinion. The fecond cafe is more to the purpofe, and if we may depend on the accura- cy of the defcription, it muftbe admitted as evidence againft the opinion given by Mr. Sharp in his critical enquiry. But the want of confiftency in moft of thefe inftances give us reafon to fufpeft, that each refpeflive ftatement is adjufted for fome particular purpofe. In the preceding cafe by Mr. Douglas, after the progrefs of the difeafe was fuppofed to have been prevented by the bark, the remedy was omit- ted, and the difeafe returned; but if we attend to the hiftories before us, we fhall meet with a defcription of fimilar circumftances, whatever were * Philofaphical Tranfafiions, vol. 37, for the years 1731, 1782, page 434.

To fupport the firfl propofal would require more confidence than in general falls to the lot of a fingle individual ; the latter is protedled by the appearance of humanity, and ultimately jufliried by the uncertainty of fuccefs, even when there is leafl reafon to be apprehenfive of difap- pointment. What renders this queflion fo particularly interefting is, that it is a judgment beyond which there is no appeal ; for when the de- cifion is once made, the fate of the patient is irrevocably determined. When inflammation has feized the part, and fever taken pofTeffion of the conflitution, amputation would then increafe the danger; it would be an additional infult to the powers of nature labouring under the preffure of previous difeafe. As inflammation of the injured part and conflitutional fever are the two important circumflances which conflitute the danger, yet it may fometimes happen that mortification may take place independent of thefe circumflances, and in fuch cafes amputation may becomeadmiflible.

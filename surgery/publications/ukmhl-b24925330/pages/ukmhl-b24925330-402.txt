THE OPERATIVE 378 the propriety of Mr, Bell’s opinion refpe&ing the inutility of the fillet as a diretlion for the knife in amputation ; but the fubfequent directions on this fubjeft are lefs fatisfaclory. He advifes the operator to follow the knife with his eye *, for the purpofe of directing its progrefs; but I am apprehenfive that, if we only follow the knife with the eye, we (hall be too late in our obfervations, and we may perhaps find out our miftake when the mifchief is done, but fnall not by this method proteCt ourfelves from error. The child, who had read Gay’s Fables, would have expreffed himfelf better on this occanon, if he had recolleCted that we are there in- formed “ It is right that care fhould go before.” I have noticed this inflance, for the purpofe of (hewing how great men too often bewilder themfelves in the cloud with which they furround the objeft that they are attempting to explain. And in the prefent inflance we find that the writers on furgery havealfo dealt in myflery ; like other learned teachers, who fometimes blind their pupils with the duft of fci- ence for fear they fhould fee the works of nature in a better light than they before have placed them. The principal improvements in the operation of amputation, that have taken place within this lad century, are the tourniquet, ligature, and double incifion ; thefe great outlines are certainly objects of the firfl im- portance, but the numerous and infignificant obfervations of fubfequent commentators can only ferve to create a myflery, and render a plain fubjeft unintelligible. Mr. Bell has with great propriety ridiculed the * Bell’s Syftem of Surgery, vol. 6. page 341 et 360. fifth edition. opinion

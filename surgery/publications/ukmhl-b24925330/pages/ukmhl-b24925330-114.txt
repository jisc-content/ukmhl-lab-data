PHYSIOLOGY. 9° in confequence of the languid ftate of the circulation, depending on the diflance of lituation from the heart. Whereas, on the contrary, I think it is evident that the diameters of the arterial tubes are fo proportioned that the momentum of the blood is the fame in all parts of the body, at the ex- tremity of the arterial fyflem; for we find every part equally fupplied with blood, and nutrition and other vital funflions as perfe£lly performed in the extremities, as in parts that are nearer to the heart. The glandular fyflem having been fupplied, and the bufinefs of nutri- tion accomplifhed; we find a part of the animal fluids is then difcharged as excrementitious by the excretory du£ls of the fkin and other organs of excretion, and the remainder is taken up by the veins to be conveyed back to the right fide of the heart. If we attentively examine the mechanifm of the venous fyflem, we fhall find much inflruflive evidence, and important information. In the ar- terial fyflem the progrefs of the bloOd commences at the centre and paf- fes to the circumference; but in the veins the blood is collefled by innu- merable branches at the circumference, and conduced to the centre. If the motion of the blood in the arteries and veins alike depended on the fame caufe, the effefls would be the fame: in the arteries the fupply is at intervals, and the motion of the blood through the whole arterial fyf- tem correfponds with the motion of the heart; but in the veins the mo- tion of the blood preferves an uninterrupted regularity. In cafes of fyncope, when the a&ion of the heart is for a time fufpended, and

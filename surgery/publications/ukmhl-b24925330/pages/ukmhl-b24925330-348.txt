MEDICINAL TREATMENT, 324 But On the fourth day after the fecond bleeding there was an evident in- creafe of difeafe; in confequence of which, I wifhed the bleeding to be repeated, but the vein being fmall and deep feated, and only having the light of a fmall candle 1 did not fucceed; the next morning I vifited my patient for the purpofe of renewing the attempt, when I fucceeded by opening the vein with a large orifice; and being apprehenfive that the difficulty of performing the operation would be every time increafed, I was determined to make the molt of the prefent opportunity, and in confequence I was induced to take away two large bafons full of blood; which were found on examination to contain exadly one pound each. This immediately produced a reduction of the painful fymptoms; ten grains of calomel were given in the evening and a dofe of falts the morn- ing following, which was once after repeated in diminifhed quantities; the neutral medicine with nitre was given in the intervals, and in about a weekâ€™s time the patient was completely recovered. Whereas I am well convinced, on the unqueff ionable evidence of other cafes where bleeding was not made ufe of with the fame liberality, that if, on the contrary, bleeding had only been made ufe of in fmall quantities in the prefent inffance and at longer intervals, the cure would have been but imperfedly performed, and a ffate of apparent debility have continued for a length of time afterwards. But if the difeafe in the firfl inffance is completely conquered, the powers of health will then be fet at liberty to refume their functions, in confequence of which the exhauff- ed ffate of the conflitution will be foon reffored ; returning appetite will didate the propriety of a liberal indulgence in the ufe of cordial food, and its falutary effeds will foon demonffrate the refiorative influence on the conflitution.

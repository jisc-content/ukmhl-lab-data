2 THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE though in the refult there may be little to approve. Implicit fubmidion to the diflates of any author can never lead the way to fcientidc informa- tion, and the necedity of attentive invedigation will increafe, in propor- tion to the extent, and intricacy of the fubjeft; it is the reader’s bufmefs to examine the whole evidence that lies before him, to try the quedion by the immutable principles of nature, and ultimately to form an opinion for himfelf. As for thofe who are not capable of critically examining what they read, they may as well lit Hill, and not attempt to read at all; for he, that is not capable of forming an opinion for himfelf, mull ever re- main in a date of doubt and uncertainty, and the lad book that he reads, will probably prove the limited fource of his information, the bads of his theory, and his guide in pra£lice. If I had not the authority of written evidence to refer to, I fhould not hazard an opinion, or attempt to prove the imperfebl date of the lubjeft before us; and in what degree the opinion of the prefent time may coincide, is aquedion offuch delicacy, that I diall not take upon myfelf to deter- mine. It is realonable to conclude, that the writings of the drd profefli. onal chara&ers will have condderable induence on the public opinion, and though we may meet with many exceptions, this mud be confidered the mod certain dandard to which we can appeal. I fhall for this purpofe drd folicit the reader’s attention to Mr. Brom- feild’s chirurgical obfervations. This celebrated author had his lhare of reputation, and was in his time looked up to, as one at the head of his profedion; for which reafon I condder his writings more dt for my pre- fent purpofe; as Ido not wifh to notice any but fuch as the public have been accudomed to look up to with refpeft.

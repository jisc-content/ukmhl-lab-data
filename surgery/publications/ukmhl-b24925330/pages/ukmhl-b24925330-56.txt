THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION ' 32 marks on the neceflity of amputation, but not as a remedy in cafes of mor- tification. The diftin&ion of the mortification of the toes and feet is an obje£t of confiderable importance, both in the fcience and pra&ice of furgery; and the defcription both of the difeafe and method of treatment is plain and intelligible. But with refpeft to the ufe of the bark in other fpecies of mortification, the whole is embarrafied with doubt, and veiled in obfcurity. To fome it may appear rather extraordinary, that a fubjeft of fuch im- portance fhould not have obtained a due {hare of Mr. Pott’s attention. But when we confider that the powers of the human body and mind have both their limits; and that no one can either think, write, fpeak, or live for ever; we {hall readily conclude, that no human exertions are adequate to the tafk of enfuring fimilar fuccefs on every occafion. And when we review Mr. Pott’s fuccefsful labours in other branches of his profeflion, we {hall ceafe to wonder, if fome obje&s of equal importance fhould have palled before his eyes, in the bufy croud of profefiional engagements, without having obtained a due {hare of critical obfervation in pra&ice, or becoming a diftinflt and feparate fubje£t of theoretical inveftigation.

112 CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. It not only requires an accurate anatomical knowledge of the injured parts, but the animal fyflem at large fhould be previoufly underflood; it will alfo be neceffary to form a judgment of the nature and extent of the difeafe, and thefeobjedta include an extent of information not eafily to be procured. It is no very difficult tafk to publifh a long catalogue of dif- eafes, with a defcription of fuch medicines as are in general ufe; but it is not equally eafy to communicate a critical knowledge of thofe difeafes, or to give an intelligible defcription of animal nature. A perfon ignorant of thefe fubjecfs may be told what remedies are ne- ceffary on certain occafions, but it is the man of fcience only that can ap- ply a bit of dry lint, or the moll fimple plaiiler, with propriety and ad- vantage. I have already examined what has been faid by others on warm and cold applications, and fhall venture to give it as my opinion that, in cafes of contufions, diflocations, and fradlures, warm applications deferve the preference. But in fra61ures we meet with difficulties that are not conne£led with contufion, or diflocation; as in fra&ures it is neceffary that the limb ffiould not be diflurbed, but conflantly continued as much as poffible in the fame pofition, which would not be confident with the fre- quent repetition of a number of remedies that might with propriety be uf- ed in other inflances. In compound fra&ures, it is fometimes neceffary to remove the banda- ges for the purpofe of dreffing the injured parts; but this may be done without difturbing the limb, and the external wound will fometimes heal « without

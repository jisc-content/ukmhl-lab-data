TOPICAL BLEEDING. 141 that would have been fupported by fuccefs in praflice. It would be bleed- ing in the arm, which is the mod; convenient and efficacious method that is made ufe of; as this fpecies of bleeding will mod expeditioufly dimi- nifh the fupply to the heart, and may be extended to any quantity, and repeated as often as neceffary. It is wrong in principle, but right in prac- tice ; whereas the other kinds of topical bleeding, made ufe of for difeafes of the brain, are not only wrong in principle, but inefficacious in pra&ice. When anatomy had difcovered that the cephalic vein had not the fup- pofed connexion with the brain, the pra&ice gradually funk into obfcu- rity. Leeches and cupping are both dill ufed for vifceral inflammation; but if we attempt to trace the connexion between the external parts from which the blood is taken and the internal, which are the feat of the difeafe, we {hall not difcover any more immediate connexion than be- tween the cephalic vein of the arm and the internal parts of the head. In addition to leeches and cupping, bleeding in the temporal artery is frequently made ufe of in affeflions of the brain; and as this is the on- ly indance of arterial bleeding that modern pra&ice * prefumes to fane* tion, this part of the fubject may with propriety be firlt determined. In this method of topical bleeding, feveral of the preceding obje&ions are avoided; as the evacuation may be made to any quantity, and with confiderable expedition, but cannot be fo frequently repeated as bleeding * It may here be neceffarv to inform thofe, who have not read every ridiculous book that has beett written on this fubjeft, that, fome years ago, an Arterietomical Quixote attempted to open the caro- tid artery, N n io

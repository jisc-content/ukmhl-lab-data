GUN-SHOT .WOUNDS* 103 If Doflor Underwood intended to allude to the mortification of the toes and feet, when he mentioned dyfcracy as a caufe, he fhould have expref- fed himfelf in intelligible language; or if his objefl was to point out any new fpecies of difeafe, he fhould have illuflrated his theory by examples. In cafes of mortification where the bark did not fucceed, the vitriol, cse- nd. and fpirituous cinnamon water are recommended, but with what views or at what periods of the difeafe this compofition may be given with the greatefl probability of fuccefs, are circumftances that remain undetermi- ned. He mentions an inflance* where the bark failed, and this compofi- tion was afterwards given with fuccefs; and that the falutary powers of the vitriol may appear unqueflionable, we are informed that the difeafe repeatedly re-appeared in returning to the bark, and was as often flopped by returning to the vitriol. This is a fpecies of argument frequently made ufe of by the advocates for new medicines ; but why either a phyfician or furgeon fhould return to an inefficacious medicine, when he has met with one whofe powers have fbewn more falutary influence, I fhall not prefume to determine. In one place opium is faid to have been produflive of mifchief ,vhen prefcribed without due difcrimination, but it is afterwards recommend- ed in a phlogiflic diathefis, in company with bleeding, purging, and faline * 111 once faw a remarkable inftance of this in a large fpreading fphacelus, which was immedi- ately checked by it, after the largefl dofes of the bark had failed; and repeated re-appearances of the gangrene upon returning to the bark, as often flopped by returning to the vitriol,” Dr. Underwood’s furgical trafts, page 284. draughts.

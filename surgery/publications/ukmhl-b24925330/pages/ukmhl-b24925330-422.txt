It is not my intention to enter into a critical examination of all the operations of furgery, I only wifh to fhew that one fcientific principle may be carried through the whole. But it is not by the invefligation of a Tingle principle that we muft expefl to eflablifh a complete fydem of chirurgical pathology. It Teems to have long been the general opinion of hofpital furgeons in Town, that patients in flrong health do not fo frequently recover afier amputation as thofe who are funk by previous difeafe. But this opinion appears to me fo truly paradoxical, that, notwithdanding the high autho- rity with which it is fanftioned, I cannot think that it is well founded ; and if the fa£I is, as here dated, in the London hofpitals, it does not equally apply to patients in other muations.

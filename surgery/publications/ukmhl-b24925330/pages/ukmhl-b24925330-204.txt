l8o HISTORICAL EVIDENCE# June 16. <{I cutoff the Remainder of the Metatarfal Bones, and fprinkled the Fungus with Precip. Rub, 19. “ I perceived the Tibia bare about the Middle, a large Sinus, and a confiderable Difcharge; therefore advifed them to have a Confuliation with Serjeant Dickins and Mr. Chefelden. 2 1. “ Serjeant Dickins and Mr. Chefelden went along with me, and I laid open that large Sinus, and dreffed as before. 22. <£ I laid open a fmall Sinus on the back of his Foot: There was a large Difcharge from his Wounds, which weakened him and leffened his Appetite. 23. <f The Difcharge was very feetid, and in too large a Quantity. 24. “ The Difcharge feemed rather to increafe, and his Strength to decreafe; neverthelefs, I laid open two more Sinus’s. 25. t! The Difcharge rather increafed; however, I laid open one more Sinus, and then told them, I was weary of opening daily one Sinus after another, without gaining my Point, viz. leffening the Difcharge; and that I fufpe&ed the Tibia was Carious farther than we perceived it, which might be the Caufe of that great and conftant Difcharge, and that, in my Opinion, he could not bear fo large a Drain long, and that it was bet- ter to have his Limb off before it was too late; Therefore defired ano- ther Cohfultation with the two Gentlemen before-mentioned. »N.

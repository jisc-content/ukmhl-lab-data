THE OPERATIVE M° I fhould think it probable that the fpontaneous termination of gan~ grene in mod inftances depends on its locality, and that the rapid and deftruflive progrefs of the true fpreading gangrene is always connected with a putrid diathefis of the fyftem. This may depend on the nature and extent of the injury, the date of the conftitution, and an infinite va- riety of other circtimfiances, which it would be impofiible to anticipate, or ellimate their refpeftive influence. But whether the difeafe is local, or eonnefled with a putrid diathefis, amputation is an improper remedy for mortification. In the firft infiance, it will certainly increafe the danger, and it can never be neceflary, as the mortification will flop fpontaneouf- ly, and the accumulated injury of an operation would be certain to bring on additional inflammation, which might be produfHve of dangerous and important confequences; and, on the fecond occafion, it muft be ve- ry obvious that it will prove a ufelefs operation to cut off a limb when the whole body is difeafed. « In our examination of this fubjefl we fhall find, as far back as Wife- man’s time, that he did not confider amputation a proper remedy in fuch cafes. In the cafe copied from Mr. Douglas, it was evidently his opinion that amputation was an improper remedy in mortification; but about the year forty Mr. Sharp, in a more full and accurate difcufiion, placed-thds^quefiion in a clear and intelligible point of view. When the fafts had once been clearly dated, the arguments properly arranged, and the whole fubjeft placed upon a rational bafis, experience confirmed the propriety of Mr. Sharp’s decifion, and general conviction gave a uni- formity to the public-.opinion.

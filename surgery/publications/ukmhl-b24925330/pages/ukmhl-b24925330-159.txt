THE EFFECTS OF BLEEDING, 3 35 If this ingenious writer had reflected for a fingle moment, he mud have immediately recolle&ed many inftances to the contrary. When a body is fufpended by the attra&ion of cohefion, or of magnetifm, the power of gravity is not deftroyed; or if he had recollected the courfe of projec- tiles, he would have met with an example where matter obeys the direc- tion of two feparate laws; or if he had directed his attention to the fyflem in which we move, he would have found that the matter of the univ^rfe is fufpended in the medium of two aiftinH and feparate powers. His ob- fervations on this occaiion are therefore all . erroneous, and the analogy is inapplicable; but from motives of refpefi to the high opinion that the public had formed of his abilities in natural philofophy, I (hall now at- tempt to make his own illuffration the bafis of my reply. The meafles and fmall-pox may both exiff in the conftitution at the fame time; and the meafles, affing with fuperior influence, fufpends the fmall-pox, but does not deftroy them; not even during the interval of their fufpenfion. The example from the medical commentaries is much more fatisfac- tory than the inflance defcribed by Mr. I. Hunter; in the former the fmall-pox had been out for two days, and the fuppuration had begun, be- fore the meafles jnade their appearance; we are not told that the fmall- pox difappeared, their progrefs was fufpended, and they continued in the fame ftate. In the latter inftance, the child was taken ill on the fourth day after the inoculation for the fmall-pox; and the meafles appeared on the fixth day, which was previous to the comencement of the fmall- pox fever, and whilft we might confider the infection as perfectly local: but, in both cafes, the progrefs of the difeafe feems evidently fufpended. In like manner, inflammation does not dellroy the gout, it only fufpends its

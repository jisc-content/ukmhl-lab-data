MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 253 But as this is not a phlogiftic difeafe, I am of opinion that lefs caution is neceflary; whereas on the oppofite fide of the queftion, in cafes of ery- fipelas, which do fometimes end in mortification, if the bark was given be- fore the inflammatory fymptoms had fubfided, it might be produftive of the mod important confequences. But in the prefent inftance we have not this difficulty to contend with; in all cafes of external injury that do not terminate in mortification, it is reafonable to fuppofe that a falutary fuppuration takes place at the crifis of the fever, which marks the folution of the difeafe. And it alfo frequent- ly happens that, although this crifis may be falutary in the firft inftance, if bark and cordials are notfoon adminiftered the whole fyftem may in a Abort time fink into a ftate of debility, from which it may not again be eafily reftored. But in thofe cafes that terminate in mortification, it appears more than probable to me that when the fever begins to fubftde, inftead of a falutary fuppuration, a famous difcharge takes place in confequence of the excefs of previous fever, and the exhaufted ftate of the fyftem; that if the pow- ers of nature are fufficient to fupport the conftitution, the difeafe is then limited to the parts; but if the powers of the conftitution are in a finking ftate, and the adminiftration of bark and cordials is delayed at this period, under thefe circumftances I am inclined to fufpeft that this morbid dif- charge.is at that critical period taken up by the abforbents and conveyed into the fyftem, in confequence of which a putrid diathefis is eftablifhed, and a fpreading gangrene takes place in the injured part, which, in con- fequence of the putrid diathefis, is with morbid rapidity communicated to the whole fyftem.

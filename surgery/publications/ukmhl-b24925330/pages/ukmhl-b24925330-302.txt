278 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. I once had a cafe of umbilical hernia under my care; which For about two years previous to the fatal termination wasextremely large, of uneven furface-, and irreducible. In other refpefls the patient was in perfeff health, and became very corpulent in confequence of the inability to ufe her accudomed exercife. As it was probable that a large portion of the intedines wTas contained in the hernia, it frequently happened in the lad two years of her life that (Inclure took place attended with violent pain and obdru&ion in the bowels. In this cafe bleeding appeared to me not only the firft, but the mod important, remedy wTe had to dee to, and it is not probable that purgative medicines would procure a paffage through the contents of the hernia, under fuch circumdances, until the dridfure was fird removed.

But the time at lad arrived when neither bleeding nor purgative medi- cines would fucceed; and, though the difeafe ended in mortification, dill the blood did not bear the marks of indammation.

*99 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. If this new application proved ufeful in the firft inftance, why fhould any other means be firft tried in the fecond; and why fhould not the mofl efficacious remedy have the preference ? But the reafon is too obvious to require further explanation; for the truth is, that every one of thefe wri- ters, without exception, have each endeavoured to fupport his favourite hypothefis. And if we critically examine any of thefe cafes, and compare the whole together, we fhall find that the queftion ffill remains undeter- mined; whether the boaffed cures depended on the influence of the re- fpe&ive remedies, or whether they were all fpontaneous terminations of difeafe.

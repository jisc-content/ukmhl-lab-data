t>i PHYSIOLOGY. &. day, all exprefs themfelves withfuch unlimited confidence, as if the phe- nomena ofblood globules were too evident to be confidered a matter of doubt, or remain a queflion of uncertainty. Mr. I. Hunter introduces this fubjeft by obferving that “the blood, whilft circulating in the veffels, appears to the eye to be a homogeneous mafs; but when it is palling in veffels fo fmall as almoft to feparate its vi- fible parts, and is viewed in a microfcope, there is no appearance but that of globules moving in the veffels*.” The white globules in all proba- bility here became invifible, as it certainly would be highly indecorous to fuppofe that they were left behind; for'if the red globules are the leaft im- portant part of the blood, the laws of fubordination would forbid that they fhould take the lead. But if fuch is the appearance of the blood in the microfcope, the method of afcertaining the faft fhould have been accurately defcribed, and the rea- ders inftru&ed how to repeat the experiments, that they might alfo have the evidence of their own fenfes. Such nice experiments require great accuracy, much more fo than the general pretenders to philofophy are poffeffed of. The whole at prefent depends upon affertion, and we are not even in- formed whether the parties ever attempted a critical examination of the fubjeft, by experimental inveftigation; whether the experiments were conducted with caution and ability, or whether the whole at laft was not a microfcopic delufion. * I.

238 CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. wounded parts diflurbedfor thepurpofe of making any additional attempts for the extra&ion of the ball, the danger mull with certainty be confider- ably increafed.

And I am well convinced that it frequently happens, that more mifchief is done by violent attempts to extrafl the ball, than by the ori- ginal injury. But if the injury is only a few degrees inferior to the falu- tary powers of nature, an addition that would otherwife be inconfiderable may determine the fate of the patient. By way of illuffration, let us eflimate the powers of health at twenty; and, in oppofition, let us fuppofe the influence of the injury at four teen, the admiffion of external air at one, the effe61s of probing at two, the injury done by the forceps at three, the balance will then ffand equal; « but if we take into the account the agitation of the patient’s mind, with the ffimulus of frefh dreffings, and many other circumffances that are in- feparable from this operation, we fhall find that this fingle attempt, in ad- dition to the original injury, will with certainty determine the fate of the patient. For my own part I muff acknowledge, that it is a fubjeft which I fhould treat with the greateft caution ; and where the life of one perfon and perhaps the happinefs of another depended on the event, I fhould think it would prove an inexpreflible fatisfa&ion to all the parties concern- ed,

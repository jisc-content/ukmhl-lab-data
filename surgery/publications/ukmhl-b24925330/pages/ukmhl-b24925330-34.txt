THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE 6 Though confidence in this medicine is called prejudice, yet we are im- mediately told that “this partiality is very excufable, as there can be no doubt but that the high opinion they entertain of it, in fuch cafes, mufi be founded on experience, as probably fome very extraordinary and unex- pefred cures have been performed, where the bark was the chief remedy employed.” Let me here afk what more rational evidence of the falutary powers of a medicine can be thought requifite, than the experience of very extra- ordinary and unexpefied cures; but does this experience coincide with his own, and does what he has obferved in practice authorize this conclu- fion ? Has he met with infiances in his own pra&ice, where the bark has performed extraordinary and unexpefled cures, and does his own expe- rience convince him of its efficacy? Unexpe&ed cures they mufi; be, to one who does not believe in the efficacy of the remedies made ufe of; but if the powers of a medicine are doubtful and not to be depended upon, why make ufe of them at all, or if this is not the only remedy, fome other method of treatment more likely to prove efficacious fhould have been pointed out. The whole of this difcuffion is certainly fo far unfavourable to the bark as a remedy in mortifications; our next objeft will be to examine what is faid on the oppofite fide of the quefiion.

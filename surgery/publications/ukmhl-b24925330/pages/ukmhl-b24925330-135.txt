GUN-SHOT WOUNDS* ill to what degree thefe refpeCtive remedies are to be made ufe of, is not ex- Bark is faid to be ordered indifcriminately in cafes of gun-fhot wounds, and the laft paragraph in Mr. Iohn Hunter’s book furnifhes us with am- ple evidence infupportof this affertion. He fays, “ Bark is greatly re- commended in gun-fhot wounds, and with good reafon; but it is ordered indifcriminately to all patients that have received fuch wounds, whatever the fymptoms or conftitution of the patient may be*.” This is certainly an improper method of giving the bark or any other medicine, as it is on- ly under particular circumftances correfponding to the powers of the re fpeCtive remedies, that medicine can be given with advantage. But if Mr. I, Hunter difapproves the indifcriminate ufe of the bark by others, his own obfervations on this fubjeCt are not lefs objectionable than thofe of his predeceffors. He ftrongly recommends the bark in cafes of in- flammation, not only when the inflammation is gone off, but alfo in the time of inflammation. In one place the bark is recommended as the prin- cipal medicine as yet known in cafes of mortification, in the laft page of the book we are told that “ there is no better medicine for wounds in ge- neral, during the whole progrefs of inflammationwe muft therefore ei- ther admit, that inflammation and mortification are fimilar fpecies of dif- eafe, or that, if they are oppofite difeafes, the fame remedies are properin both inftances, or that one of thefe ftatements muft be erroneous. If the reader will attentively examine, in the introduction, the chapter on mortification, he will find a want of diftinCtion between the caufe and the effeCt. plained. * I.

319 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. But But what is moft fingular in this defcription is, that in the firfl cafe bark and wine were both given, and the difeafe continued to increafe until its progrefs was flopped by the yeaft ; and though in the two laft cafes the difeafe is fuppofed to be flopped in fo fhort a time by the falu- tary powers of the yeafl, yet the ufe of bark and wine is continued in the firfl c.tfe, and bark alone in the fecond. I do not mean to infinuate that this praflice was improper, I only wifh to obferve that as yeaft and bark were both alternately given, it mu ft be more difficult to determine to which the fuccefs is to be attributed. It is not my intention to difcourage the ufe of yeaft and fermenting liquors in putrid fevers ; but in my opi- nion new ale taken from the working vat certainly deferves the prefer- ence ; in the firfl place it will furnifh a much larger quantity of fixed air than a fpoonful of yeaft ; it contains fuga.r which is both falutary and nutritious ; and a glafs of new ale will prove an agreeable draught to the thirfty patient; from which it is evident that new ale will ferve both for medicine, nourifhment, and beverage. It is not for the purpofe of op- poftng the practice that I make thefe obfervations, I only wifh to fet forth the imp* rfeHions of cafe-writing, and to promote a more accurate exa- mination of the fubjedt. We frequently find that, after the powers of the conftitution have been much depreffed by long continued difeafe, as foon as the caufe is re- moved and the vital powers relieved from the oppreflion, if ri e bark or any other reftorative or tonic medicine is given at this critical period, the energy of returning health is frequently miftaken for the effedls of medicine ; when in reality it is the returning powers of health fet free from the oppreflion of difeafe, and refuming their former functions.

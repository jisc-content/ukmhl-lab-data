PREFACE. f JL^HE mechanifm of animal life forms a diftin£f fyftem of philofophy, to which the laws that regulate the operations of inanimate matter are in many refpedls inapplicable; and yet a knowledge of experimental philofophy is fo intimately con- ne£!ed with the ftudy of anatomy, that the ftrudfure and ope- rations of the different parts of the animal body cannot be well explained without it. To diftinguifh in what inftances thefe two branches of fcience may with propriety be connec- ted with each other, requires an extent of information, and accuracy of judgement, that is not frequently to be met with; and I prefume the following pages will bear ample tellimony to the truth of this alfertion. Thofe, who wifh to fucceed in the ftudy of philofophyj fhould acquire a knowledge of the experimental part in early b youth.

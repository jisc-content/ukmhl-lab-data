THE OPERATIVE 384 of this leather retractor, not a queflion can remain but that the operation was brought, to a hate of perfection far beyond the reprefentation that he has given on the fubjeCl. It is the bufinefs of thefe pretenders to a knowledge of the mechanical part of furgery to hate imperfeft ions and deferibe difficulties, for the purpofe of difplaying their abilities in the invention of inflruments that have in general proved both inconvenient and unneceffary. From the time that the double incifion was made ufe of by Cbefelden and Sharp, it has been the bufinefs of fucceeding writers to rob the fith authors of the merit of their difcovery by the addition of forne immagi- nary improvements, in confequence of which they attributed all the fuc- cefs to their own inventions. This leather retradfor of Mr. Gooch con- tinued for years without a rival, till Mr. Bell attempted an improvement by fubffituting two iron plates inflead of leather ; and thus we find, in the progrefs of improvements, the linen was firfl changed to leather, and now the leather is converted into iron. The latter will certainly not be in danger of clogging the faw teeth, or of being fawed in two, in the manner above-mentioned ; but there are many obvious inconveniences which it is not neceffary to mention. It is only in amputations above the knee where any inffrument of this kind is thought neceffary ; and when we confider that the fituation of the bone is nearly central, and that / a fufheient quantity of integument and mufcles may be preferved with- out any difficulty, we (hall be perfectly fatisfied refpeding the merits of this inllrument.

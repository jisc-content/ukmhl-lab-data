SECTION III. AMPUTATION CONSIDERED AS A REMEDY IN CA- SES OF MORTIFICATION, AND THE AMBIGUITY OF THE PUBLIC OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT. T\ /TR. Bell’s fyflem of furgery will with propriety become the next ob« je6t of our examination: it is a work of too much importance to be paired by without a due {hare of attention, and refpeft.

They, who are determined to oppofe the pra£Hce of amputation as much as poffible, af- fect to confider it as unnecefiary in mortification*:” this fingular attack on the fraternity of furgery appears tome as unintelligible as the reflexion is fevere and unjufiifiable ; it infinuates that a certain party of furgeons are determined to oppofe the praftice of amputation, even againfl: their bet- ter judgments; for he fays they off Eb to confider it unneceffary; which is afferting that, though they are convinced of the neceffity, they affe6l to write, fpeak, and a£i, againlt their own convi&ion. What furgeons may have faid or done, I do not prefume to be acquaint- * Bell’s fyflem of furgery, page 311, vol. 6, fifth edition. K ed

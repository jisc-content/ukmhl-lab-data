202 CH1RURGICAL TREATMENT. It may perhaps have been conhdered beneath the philofophic dignity of modern furgery, to attempt to inveftigate the properties of a white- bread poultice, or explain the effefts of a warm bath, or fomentation. But the few ufeful remedies, that the art of furgery is in poffeflion of, are of the fimple kind; and in many inftances it will be found that their ex- cellence depends more on their innocent fimplicity than their aftive powers. I am rather apprehenlive that many writers have cautiouflv avoided expreffing their fentiments on this fubjeft, either from a fear of expofing the narrow limits of their own abilities, or to avoid the danger of betray- ing the humble ftate of their profelhon. With refpeft to the treatment of mortification, it is an objeft of the firft importance, both in theory and pra&ice, accurately to mark the progrefs of the difeafe, and to diftinguifh the termination of inflammation from thofe confequences which require a very different method of treatment. It was for the purpofe of deteÂ£I- ing this inaccuracy, that I have examined with fuch attention what has been already written on this fubjeft; as I fhould not have fuppofed that the public would give me credit for fuch aflertions, if I had omitted to bring written evidence of their authenticity.

The materia medica of furgery is certainly very limited, and if we ex- cept

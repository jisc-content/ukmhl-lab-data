THE OPERATIVE 354 to all the powers of medicine, if we cannot al ways command fuccefs, (as this is a quefiion that can only be determined by the event,) it will be right to a£l with as great care and attention as if fuccefs wa-s certain. , At that time the bark was not known as a remedy in this difeafe, nor was opium, which is the molt powerful cordial in the whole materia rnedica, made ufe of on thefe occalions: and as it is the ufe of external remedies that at this time engages our attention, I Avail omit to examine the anci- ent plan of internal treatment.

It was the boafi of Sharp and Pott that the cautery was exploded be- fore their time ; and though I do not recolieft it having been recom- mended in print fince the date of Mr. Sharp’s publication, yet I am ap- prehenfive that it long furvived that period. And if we only look back to the time of Mr. Chefelden, wre fhall find that both cautery and fcarifi-- cations were fanftionea by the firft profeflional authority.

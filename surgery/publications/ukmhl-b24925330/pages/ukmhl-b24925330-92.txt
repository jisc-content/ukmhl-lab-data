68 PHYSIOLOGY# through the thoracic vifcera, has without doubt eftablifhed a bafis for fome very important improvements in the fcience ofphyfic and furgery; but our knowledge of the animal fun&ions is ftill imperfeft. The mechanifm of the vital powers is only feen in part, nor has the nature of morbid ac- tion been yet explained. If we attentively examine the ftru&ure and mechanifm of the vafcular fyftem, we (hall find throughout the whole the moll perfect order and fimplicity; but if the arterial fyftem was, as Mr. I. Hunter fuppofes, part formed of cylindrical tubes, and part of cones, the motion of the blood would conftantly vary according to the diameter of the veffel; in a coni- cal artery the motion of the blood would be flow at its bafis, and increafe in rapidity as the veffel diminiftied in diameter. If anatomifts had ever paid the leaft attention to the principles of hy- draulics, they mufthave dete&ed the inconfiftency of fuch a fyftem, and have examined the fubjeft with more attention. I (hall not enter into a critical examination of all the obfervations re- fpefting the elafticity of different parts of the animal body, but (hall en- deavour to ftiew that the contra&ion of the arteries depends on mufcular a&ion, and not on elafticity. The manner, in which blood is difcharged from a wounded artery, ftiews that their aftion is conftant, but not regular; their powers of contra6lion always being in proportion to the degree of diftention. They never re- lax except when they are perfeÂ£lly empty, on the extin&ion of life, or the fufpen*

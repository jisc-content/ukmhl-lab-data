INFLAMMATION AND 124 blood; to the fenfible qualities of which they feem to have very little relation.” Mr. Hewfon feems to have been of a contrary opinion; he in his pre* face obferves, that “an inquiry into the properties of the blood, it is pre- fumed, will be thought in a particular manner interefling, fince there is no part of the human body upon which more phyfiological reafoning is founded, nor any from which more inferences are drawn for the cure of difeafes.” I have thought fit to contrail thefe two opinions, for the purpofe of in- validating the influence of authority ; as it is the evidence of nature and voice of reafon which fhould decide. I (hall not attempt to reply in full to the queries of the one, or critically examine the experiments of the other, either of which would furnifh materials to make a volume; but I cannot agree with Do£lor Ilcbciden, that the fi^y fltuc of the blood is an objefl of no importance. He obferves that this appearance is not con- flant or regular; I have already given my opinion, that it is the confe- quence and not the caufe of inflammation : for which reafon the difeafe mud neceffarily take place previous to this appearance in the blood; but if inflammation takes the lead, itfeldom exifls long without producing this effe6l. I am ready to acknowledge, that it frequently happens that the firfl blood that is taken in inflammatory cafes has not this appearance; and certainly, if the firfl bleeding removes the dil'eafe, a fecond will not be neceffary; but if the difeafe is not abated and flill continues to in- creafe, there can then be no queflion about the propriety of a fecond bleeding, even if the firfl blood had not the fizy appearance. But if the firfl

TREATMENT OF MORTIFICATION. 7 Our author fays, “X believe, when things were brought to this points and the difcharge was extremely thin, and greatly too much in quantity, that had I not given the bark freely, I (hould have loft my patients; but under fiich circumftances they muft be blind indeed who will not acknow- ledge its fuperior efficacy to any other medicine known to us at this time.” Thus we find his opinion evidently changed, and having once acknow- ledged the falutary powers of the bark in one inftance of debility, a regu- lar feries ofconvi&ion feems immediately to take place, and the fame re- medy is recommended in all the different ftages of fphacelus, and mor- tification. For my own part X {hall not prefume to determine which fide of the queftion is beft fupported, I only wifh the reader to obferve that he at one time cenfures what he afterwards approves; in a tendency to morti- fication the ufe of the bark is reprefented as a vulgar error, but in a ten- dency to fphacelus, we are informed that the bark may not be improper. This inaccuracy of argument has been already noticed, and a proper diftin&ion between a tendency and real exiftence pointed out; it is an ambiguity of expreffion that every one, who underftands himfelf and wiffi- es to be underftood by others, would never make ufe of; it is afpeciesof language that finks beneath the dignity of philofophy^'and can only be confidered as a cloak for ignorance, or made ufe of for the purpofe of difguifing deceit. With refpeft to the fucceeding part of the fame fentence, it will be dif- ficult to determine whether the ambiguity depends on verbal inaccuracy ©r

359 FART OF SURGERY, It is evident from his own account that there was a fufficient time to have tried the experiment; but the truth is, the knowledge he had obtained from pra&ical obfervations, in fimilar cafes, convinced him that amputation would not flop the.progrefs of the difeafe. This was a cafe in which it is reafonable to fuppofe that he would have been particularly attentive; as his opinion in the fir ft inftance was rejedied, and as the fur- geon who oppofed him was not fuccefsful, he would have had an additional inducement to exert his utmoft abilities at a more advanced period of the difeafe; and as a phyfician was alfo confulted, under fuch circumflances it is probable that every affiftance would be given which the united pow- ers of furgery and phyfic could afford. The manner, in which Wifeman addreffedthe phyfician, evidentlyIhews the want of concord between the two furgeons, and his difapprobation of the method of treatment; as it is probable that he attributed the mor- tification to the retention of the ball.

It may here be right to mention that it fometimes may occur, that if the degtee of inflammation is fuch as to forbid the operation, it may be prudent to try the experiment, where the queflion remains doubtful, whe- ther the confequent tenfhm of the parts is not fufficient to prevent the difeharge of blood. If on flackening the tourniq jet the difeharge fhould not be renewed, and the inflammation fuch as to render the fuccefs of the operation doubtful, it will then be right to defer amputation until the difeafed adlion has fubfided. When I firfi read Drinkwater’s hiftory of the fiege of Gibralter, the account that he has given of the ufe of the tourniquet made a flrong im- preffion on my mind.

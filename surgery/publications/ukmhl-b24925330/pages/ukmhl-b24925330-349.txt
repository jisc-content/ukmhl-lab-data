MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 325 But, in cafes where the cure is imperfedlly performed, the conflitution is left to labour through the remaining difficulties, and continues in a (late of debility, fludfuating in an unfettled medium, not gaining the pow- ers of health nor freed from the influence ofdifeafe.

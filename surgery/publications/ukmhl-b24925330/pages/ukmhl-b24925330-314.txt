MEDICINAL TREATMENT. It 29D I once met with an infiance in an old man, who was upwards of feventy^ to whom I had repeated occafions to give the digitalis; and whenever it was given to a certain extent, infiead of producing naufea and vomiting, the confequence was a regular falivation, which in general lafled a week or ten days, and then gradually fubfided. The other infiance of the lingular effefts of digitalis was to produce petechiae. The fubjedt was of a lull habit at the commencement of his illnefs, and had led a life of great intemperance, in confequence of which the whole glandular fyfiem was become difeafed. My fir ft ohjeft was to unload the confiitution by purgative medicines, arid afterwards I began with a courfe of digitalis. After having taken this medicine for about a week, I one morning was afiomfhed to meet with a general eruption of petechiae ; my firfi fufpicion was that this was a newdifeafe, and probably theconfequence of contagion ; but when the method of treatment was chan- ged the petechias difappeared. In about a fortnightâ€™s time 1 v* as induced to refume the ufe ol the digitalis, which was productive of a return of the petechias. And as both thefe patients continued under my care for a confiderable length of time, I frequently repeated the experiments that I might be well fatisfied of the facts; but I have never finee that time met with an infiance of falivation or petechiae. Soon after the fuccefsful cafe above mentioned, I met with an infiance of phthifis pulmonalis in a very advanced fiage, and what was ccnfidered bv the friends of the young woman, who was about eighteen years of age, to be a hopelefs cafe.

MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 294 it is not likely that the fubfequent plan of treatment ffionld prove efficacious. I am well fatisHed that I have frequently fucceeded in the early ftages of confumption, by a regular fyffem of bleeding and other antiphlogiflic remedies ; and. on the contrary, I have frequently met with inftances where 1 have carried the antiphlogiflic plan to its full extent without fuccefs. I am not unacquainted with what Doflor Reid has faid againff the propriety of bleeding in confumptive cafes *; but his writings will have very little influence with them who have carefully examined the evi- dence of nature, and have eftablifhed their opinion on the more certain bafts of experimental authority. I have carried the bleeding fyflem to its full extent, and when I have defpaired of fuccefs, I have confulted the firft phyficians in this neighbourhood, and I have not only heard their opinions, but I have read the full extent of their knowledge of this fub- je£l in their preferiptions ; and have, from fuch inftrublive fcources of information, formed my own judgement of the prefent (late of the public opinion. It is not from any motives of humble condefcenfion that I flop to make an apology for this perfonal allufion ; and I flatter myfeif that I (ball not be fufpedled of blind partiality even to my intimate acquaintance, or that any one will fuppofe that I am adluated by the didlates of fervile fear. My objefl is to fearch for truth, and I do not intend that motives of falfe delicacy fhould divert me from my purpofe. * In no difeafe has bleeding been fo generally ordered, and fo frequently repeated in a given time, as in that under our confide;ation ; and I fear the obfervation has been but too much verified, “that u more die by ihe lancet than the lance.” Dr. Reid on tluhifis Pulmonalis, page 86. fit ft edition.

THE OPERATIVE 37I * * * * 6 i he buckle is a very clumfy and inconvenient part of this inftrument, and the fixing of the double ft rap with equal tightnefs is frequently attend- ed with feme difficulty; I do not mean to infinuate that thefe little difficul- ties are worthy of attention in the chamber, but every inconvenience fhould be guarded againft that may create embarrafsment in the field. The remedy which I would propofe on this occafion is, to furnifh each fide of the tourniquet with a feparate ftrap, that, when the inftrument is applied, thefe two ftraps may be pafted round the limb and tied together with a fa ft knot.

I {hall not on this occafion enter into a tedious and uninterefting de- feription of the operation of amputation, it is a fubjeft that in a general view has been long exhaufted.

It will be of very little importance to a man of real abilities, whether his knife is crooked or {freight, whether the faw is with a bow or flat blade. The number of plafters, the height of the table, have all been calculated with fcientific accuracy; but that I may give unqueftionable evidence of my candour and liberality on this occafion,. I will not even take upon myfelf to determine whether the operator

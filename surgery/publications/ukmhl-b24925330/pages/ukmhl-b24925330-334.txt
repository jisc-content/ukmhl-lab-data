MEDICINAL TREATMENT, 3lG for my own part, I do not intend to implicate others, or to makeafearch after truth a fubjedl of perfonal adulation, but confider myfell alone re- fponfible for the whole. In cafes of acute rheumatifm, when the inflammation has been con- fiderably abated, I have in the fubfequcnt ftages frequently made ufe of the digitalis with unqueflionable advantage ; and as in the prefent mftance the inflammation had terminated, and fudorific opiates had been tried in vain, I was then induced to try the digitalis, which was continued for about a fortnight, in full dofes, without the leaf! falutary advantage. Let it be here remembered that the digitalis had a fair trial ; and as it produced no good effe£l, it is reafonable to conclude that it has no influ- ence in what proved afterwards to be the real flate of the difeafe, after the inflammation was deflroyed ; if the digitalis had been an antifyphi- litic, and the treatment proved fuccefsful, I fhould never have under- ftood the true flate of the difeafe, but concluded it had been the remains of the rheumatic afte&ion. But during this time a very fmall tumour formed at the top of the head, which ultimately proved to be a venereal node; at this time I had not loft fight of the rheumatic aftebtion *, and Mr. I. Hunter obferves, * When the peiiofteum and bones become affefted, tbe pain is fometimes very confiderable, and at other times there is hardly any. Thefe pains are commonly periodical, or have their exacerba- tions, being commonly worft in tbe night. This is common-to other aches or pains, efoecially of the rheumatic kind, which the venereal pains refemble very much. When the pain is the hi ft fymptom, it affords no diftinguiftiing mark of the difeafe, it is therefoie often taken for the rheumatifm, I.

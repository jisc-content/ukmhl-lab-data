MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 3Â°3 of twenty, or four and twenty ounces. It has been already obferved that the firft time was on the twentieth of November, the fecond time on the twenty-third, which was repeated on the twenty-ninth, again on Decem- ber the third, the fifth, the feventh, the tenth, the twentieth, and twenty- firft ; the digitalis was continued, with feme intermiffions, from the twenty- fixth of November to the twenty-fixth of January; the dofe was regu- larly five grains, fometimes only given at night, at others both night and morning. When it was taken night and morning in general, my patient could not bear above five or fix dofes, at which times it was omitted for two or three days; in the above-mentioned period he took fourteen dofes of purgative medicines, and on the intermediate days took faline medicines three times a day, with a drachm of nitre in each dofe. With refpefl to the external applications, it has been before obferved that he was well wafhed every night and morning with warm vegeto-mi- neral water, and he was afterward anointed all over with the ceratum fa- turni of Goulard, and this method was continued until the difeafe was conquered. As he was reduced by the long continuance of the difeafe and the great evacuations that were made ufe of, I was in hopes the bark might have been given in this inflance with advantage; but I only tried two dofes of a common decoclion which, infiead of giving ftrength, im- mediately increafed the atlion of the fyftem; and I have no doubt that, if it had been continued for a few days, it would certainly have revived the inflammatory difeafe; inftead of which a few dofes of calomel with cool- ing purges were all the remedies that were afterwards made ufe of to complete the cure.

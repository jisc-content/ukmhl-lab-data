MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 251 Sat the difeafe in queftion, which is the confequence of external inju- ry, has no variety in kind, it can only vary in degree. I do not pretend to determine at what diftance of time from the period when the accident firft took place, the bark may be given in cafes of external injury of the extremities; it is the ftate of the difeafe, and not the time of its duration, that is to determine the point in queflion.

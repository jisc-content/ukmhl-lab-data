A 6 THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION ticularly and juftly celebrated, are the diftempers called gangrene and mortification*.” They are exprefsly termed the diftempers, which evi- dently implies a diftin6Hon between the two; and which is flill more flrongly marked when mention is made of flopping the one, and refilling the other. It is not here reprefented as one diflemper known by two dif- ferent appellations, but two diftempers with their refpeflive chara6teriftic diftin£lions. This is one view of the fubje£l, but in the fame fentence we find thefc two united, where it is obferved, that “ there is a particular fpecies even of thefe, in which this noble medicine mod frequently fails;” the fpecies here alluded to, is the mortification of the toes and feet; but if we may form our judgment by Mr. Pott’s own defcription, as this does not bear the leaft refemblance to any other kind of mortification, we muft confider this a diftinfl difeafe. He fays that this difeafd “is very unlike to the mortification from inflam- mation, to that from external cold, from ligature, or bandage, or to that which proceeds from any known and vifible caufe, and this as well in its attack as in its procefs:” It is therefore only in the termination of thefe difeafes that we meet with the leaft refemblance, in a practical view this laft period cannot be an objefl of our confideration, as the vital principle being once extinguifhed, and the organization deftroyed, it is impoflible that the vital powers fhould be again reftored; it is the bufinefs of phyfic and furgery to preferve the living parts, not to revive the dead; if then f Pott on the mortification of the toes and feet page 148. mor-

THE OPERATIVE 342 I remember, more than twenty years ago, attending tbs leQures of one of the puriifans of Bilguer, and can now recollect the particular books that were recommended on this fubjedl; but Mr. Pott’s arguments direct- ed my opinion to the oppofite fide of the queflion. Many of the little pamphlets that made their appearance at that time have long funk into obfcurity, which in their day might ferve the purpofe of amufing thofe whofe attention could be captivated by fuch writers as TiflTot, or whofe opinions could be influenced by fuch furgeons as Bilguer. But when erroneous opinions prepare the way for free and liberal enquiry, they may ultimately ferve the caufe of truth, and blind zeal may lead the way to ufeful information and important difcoveries. Wifeman, who was furgeon to Charles the fecond, wrote in thataufpi- cious reign ; and though he did not anticipate the modern theory, yet he was not lefs attentive to the phenomena of nature. The ftile in which his book is written varies much from that of modern times, there is a plain unadorned fimplicity of expreflion that is not frequently to be met with in writers of the prefent day. IT is manner is certainly that of a plain praflical writer, but the whole is flrongly marked with unqueflionable evidence of highly cultivated profeflional information. When we confider that Wifeman’s furgery is not a work of theory, but a defcription of the obfervations of extenfive praflice, we fhall ceafe to wonder he did not fee the full extent of the evidence which he had fo accurately recorded. The neceflity of immediate amputation in cafes of external injury is particularly noticed, and the impropriety of ufing amputation as a remedy to flop the progrefs of mortification is men- tioned

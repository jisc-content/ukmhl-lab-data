9.QQ THE OPERATIVE t ‘..y •tdce•; and ,-opr knowledge of this fubjedf mu ft remain extremely imperfc£l, if it is not founded on fcientific principles. There are other operations .in furgery that are fupoofed to he attended with greater difficulties; but, in my opinion, a knowledge both of the fcientific and mechanical pans of furgery is equally applicable to all. Perhaps cutting for the hone (which has in general been looked upon as one of the fiift-operations in fur my) will be cor.fidered an exception to this general rule; and I am ready to ac nowledge that there are few operations that are more perfectly mechanical; but in this inftanceit will be neceffiiry to be acquainted with the anatomy of the parts, which is the only fcientific objccft that is connedled with this operation; for this is a fubj°6f that is not in general conncfted with difeafe. The whole bufinefs is to make an opening through parts that are in a ftate of health, and extradi a hard fubftance from an inward cavity that produces dif- trefting confequences by the effefts of mechanical preflu re. From which it muft be evident that, independent of a knowledge of chirurgical dif- eafes, a lithotomift may perform this operation with fafetv, dexterity, and addrefs ; and as the heali g of the wound is an operation of nature, and requires very little afliftance from art, l think it is ver) poflible that the reputation of an accompldhed lithotomift may be obtained, independent of a knowledge of the flrft pr i nciples of furgery. But if inflammation or any other unexpended accident fhould take place, the operation will ulti- mately fail for want of fcientific information. The moft difficult cafes that occur in the prafliceof furgery, are where the operation is connected with a ftate of difeafe. There are two inflan- ces

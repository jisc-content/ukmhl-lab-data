52 PHYSIOLOGY.’ animal fluids under different circumftances; we might with equal propri- ety conclude, that the change of milk into butter or cheefe depended upon confcioufnefs and volition. In the former page we meet with an explanation of this neceffity. <fBy aftion taking place from neceffity, effefts are meant which arife in confequence of fome unufual or unnatural change going on in the parts.” The change of fluids into folids for the fupport, renewal, or increafe of the different parts of the animal body is a regular procefs, that cannot be confidered either unufual, or unnatural; and whether this animal fur&ion is performed by any procefs fimilar to coagulation, or by any other oper- ation, more confident with the laws of animal life; this muft be confidered one of the mod natural operations of the animal fyfiem. If what is conftant and uniform can be confidered unufual or unnatural, the prefent ftatement would then appear lefs obje&ionable: but as co- agulation is a regular effeft, that we have daily opportunities of obferving, it muft certainly be confidered a natural operation, or a change that takes place in confequence of diforganization, or a lofs of vital principle. But even if every faff was fupported by the evidence of nature, they form in their prefent ftate a mifcellaneous affemblage of unconnedled obfervati- ons ; that do not in the leaft illuftrate the ceconomy of the fyftem in a ftate of health, or ferve to explain the nature and difeafe. It is certainly the perfe&ion of philofophical empiricifm, je&ures without evidence, or to attempt to carry an analyfis fanguiferous properties of to form con- of nature be- yond

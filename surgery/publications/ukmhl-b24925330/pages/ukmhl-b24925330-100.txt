PHYSIOLOGY, 7 6 The known. And I cannot omit this opportunity of obferving, that I feldom read an account of a diffe&ion without noticing fomefuch difgraceful in- ilances of ignorance or inattention. It is not neceffary to produce a long catalogue of evidence in fupport. of this alfertion, as a fingle example will be fufficient. When Dr. Rat- tray gave his evidence on Capt. Donellan’s trial, he fuppofed that the va- cuity of the arteries after death was the effeft of poifon*: but a profef- fional man fhould certainly be well acquainted with the fubjeft before he prefumes to give an opinion, or if he has no opinion to give, it becomes a virtue to confefs his ignorance; and this may always be done without the leaft impeachment either of his abilities as an anatomift, or undemand- ing as a man. For if after the mod careful and attentive anatomical examination he is not able to difcover any evidence to the contrary, it would certainly be right under fuch circumftances to give a general opinion, that the ap- pearances were perfe£lly natural and void of all anatomical evidence whatever. * The Trial of JOHN DONELLAN, Efq. Taken in fhort-hand by Jofeph Gurney, page 32. Anfwer by Dottor RATTRAY. “ I believe the effe&s of poifon is to empty the arteries in general and pufh the blood into the veins; that is my opinion at prefent, fo far as I have gone into the matter.” In the medical tranfaftions vol. 3, page 8, we meet with Doftor Heberden’s account of a diffe&ion of a man who died of an angina pe&oris in which he obferves “that the left ventricle of the Heart was remarkably ftrong and thick, and as perftftly empty of blood as if it had been wafhed.” It would be extremely illiberal to reflect on a phyftcian for not underftanding anatomy, but what tnuft appear much more fingular is, that, like Doctor Oquetos, they fhould not underhand gieek.

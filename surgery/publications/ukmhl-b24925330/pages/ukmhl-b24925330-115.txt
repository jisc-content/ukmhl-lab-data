PHYSIOLOGY* 91 and the arteries deprived of their fupply, the arteries become completely empty, and the blood is all accumulated in the veins. This circumflance is evidently proved by * the palenefs of the face which takes place in con- fequence of the vacuity of the cutaneous arteries; and in opthalmia, when the arteries of the tunica conjun6liva are morbidly diftended, and render- ed vifible by inflammation, if the patient is bled until fainting takes place, the florid appearance of the veflels finks away, and the tunica conjunfliva will appear as white as if the inflammation had never taken place. But this effe6t of bleeding is only of (hort duration, as the florid appearance will return as foon as the circulation is reftored. 4 I do not introduce this inftance as an illuflration of the effefts of ge- neral bleeding in cafes of opthalmia, though I am well convinced that it is the moil efficacious; and that topical bleeding in fuch cafes is an infig- nificant remedy. But it is to the evidence of nature that I wifli to appeal; and without examples, the moft ingenious arguments will be confidered only as matter of opinion. Mr. I. Hunter obferves, “that the whole powers or materials of life, are called into the vital parts or citadel, and the out-works are left to them- felves; and adds, that fuch is the cafe with fainting Sic. &c.” If the veins are fuppofed to form the citadel, and the arteries the out-works, the me- taphor may then prove admiflible; but the idea is erroneous, and the re- prefentation not confident with the mechanifmof the vafcular fyftem. The power, with which the blood moves forward through the veins, is * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 317,

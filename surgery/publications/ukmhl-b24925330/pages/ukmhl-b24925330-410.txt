THE OPERATIVE ed with the effefts of inflammation in this inftance, he confidered the ad- vantages fuperior to the danger; and defcribes his fuecefs as being fome- what fimilar to what at this day would be termed healing by the firfl intention. It was then a difputed point whether bandage or the crofs- ftitch fhould have the preference, fo that the application of both was at that time well known, and confequently the crofi-ditch could not with propriety be attributed to Mr, Sharp. But on this occafion it will be right to recollect, that the double iucifion was not known in Wifemanâ€™s.time; and confequently fuch methods of bringing the parts together were more neceffary ; at the fame time the inconveniences of this method of practice had been accurately noticed, and if fubfequent writers had attended to what had been previoufly faid on this fubjefi, they would not have attri- buted to Mr. Sharp what after the invention of the double iueifion became unneceffary. And it mad be evident that the revival and repetition of fuch inftances of ancient pradlice have all depended on a want of atten- tion to the hiftorical progrefs of the profefhon. It is not that I intend to examine the merits of the crofs-flitch, or the preference that fhould be given to the dry future ; the queftion is whether they are not both improper, and that the only merit of either, to which we may give an approbation, is, by comparing the degrees of im- propriety and giving the preference to that which is leal! prejudicial. I am well convinced that the inflammation fubfequent to the amputation of a limb is frequently fo confiderable, that any kind of tight bandage either by ligature or plaflers mud be productive of certain danger; and as no advantages could arife from attempting to confine the parts bv li- gature or plafter, it would be creating a danger without any probability of advantage. .

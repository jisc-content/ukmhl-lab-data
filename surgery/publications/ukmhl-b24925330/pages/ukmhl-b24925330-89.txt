I believe few will queftion the abilities of Swammerdam. In the ufe of optical inftruments and minute diffedtion he difplayed a degree of in- genuity and dexterity perhaps unequalled; and the accuracy of his de- fcriptions muff convince the reader of the truth of his affertions; his book is not an affemblage of fpeculative opinions, but reprefentations of nature. At the time that the doftrine of blood globules firft made its appearance, Swammerdam was in the meridian of life, and purfuing the fludy of mi- crofcopic anatomy with uncommon induftry and fuccefs. He has given a plate of the blood of a Ioufe, as it appeared in a glafs tube in a powerful microfcope; in which are defcribed a great number of fmall globules, but notwithftanding this appearance, Swammerdam very judi- cioufiy obferves, that “it is a matter of doubt whether the blood in the vef- fels has any globules, for when drawn from them, it may eafily acquire that figured,” from which it is evident, that, though he .was contempo- rary with Leuwenhoek, he was not convinced of the truth of this opinion. * Cavallo’s effay, page 224. t Swammerdam’s hiftory of infefts, page 31, s There

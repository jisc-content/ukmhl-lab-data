MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 262 do I wifii it to be underflood, that I am of opinion, that it is poffibJe to ex- plain the operations of animal life alone on mechanical principles, 1 only mention one as an illuflration of the other. But if a certain degree of heat afrefts the head and brings on delirium and fainting, let whatever may be the caufe or mode of operating, the fa6l fhould teach us to diflinguifh a hot bath from a warm one; and thefe cir- cumftances evidently prove the propriety of one copious bleeding before the warm bath is made ufe of, even if there is no phlogifiic diathefis. But in cafes of vifceral inflammation when the whole fyflem partakes of the difeafe, it is then that large and frequent bleedings form the moft important part of the method of treatment which we have to depend upon. Purging is certainly the fecond objefl, but except it is at a very early pe- riod, or the difeafe is of an inferior degree, it frequently happens that pur- gative medicines will not operate unlefs the flrifture has been relieved by previous bleeding. I have known inflances where powerful dofes of purgative medicines have been given and the bowels remain inaftive, un- til by very copious bleeding the whole fyflem has been fet at liberty. On fuch occafions I have frequently taken two pounds of blood away at a time, and I am well convinced that, when large quantities are taken, the difeafe is frequently deflroyed with the leaf! expence to theâ€™ con- flitution, as two pounds taken at once will fometimes prove more effica- cious than double the quantity taken at four different intervals. But it would be impoffible to prefcribe any certain quantity, it muff depend on the effedls; in fuch inflances it will not be fufficient for a phyfician to pre- fcribe

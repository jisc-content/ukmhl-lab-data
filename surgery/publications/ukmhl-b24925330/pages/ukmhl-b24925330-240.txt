But fo much was I apprehenfive that the cafe would prove tedious and the parties become diflatisfied, that 1 exprefled a wifli that my patient, who was a Gentleman’s fervant, might be admitted into a neighbouring infirmary.

The next application, that was made ufe of, was an embrocation of equal parts of Gowlard’s extraft and oil, with which the parts were plentifully rubbed three or four times a day. This in a few days produced a numb- nefs in the parts nearly approaching to palfy, and the pain confequently ceafed.

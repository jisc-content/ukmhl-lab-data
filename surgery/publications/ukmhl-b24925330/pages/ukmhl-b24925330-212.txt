l88 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE# review the whole, we fhall ceafe to wonder that Mr. Sharp fhould give his decided negative to the general opinion. The example before us, as deferibed by Mr. Gooch, is a mortification in a man aged eighty-one, where (it is afferted) the Bark Teemed to be of great fervice. He fays, te Auguft the 24th. 1731* I was called to J. H. of M. and found a deep mortification about the breadth of a crown-piece upon the fide of his foot. Confidering his age, his having been confined to his bed many years, and that he was a drinker of fpirituous liquors to excefs, there could be but little expe&ation of curing him; yet it was neceffary to prevent his be- coming noifome to himfelf, and every body about him whilft he lived, which I confefs I thought would be but a fhort time, as I told the parifli officers who fent for me. f(l direflpd n J a warm cataplafm to the foot twice a day; that he fhould take a dofe of an ele&uary of the Bark and Snake root every three hours, wafhing it down with a glafs of annifeed water, which had long been his favorite liquor; and that his diet fhould be of good nutriment warm and fpicy. After regularly perfevering in this method about a month, there was afeparation of the dead parts from the living, at the jun&ion of the ojfa Cuneiform, and metatars, where I disjointed the foot, without any pain or lofs of blood, and the flump was perfeflly healed in three months. After this the poor creature lived more than a year, with as good health as for many years before, drinking gin or annifeed water to the day of his death, faying he could not live without it, and that my indulging him with it, he was fure, faved his life. <( In

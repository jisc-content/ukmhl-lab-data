198 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. of proving that opium is a fpecific in this difeafe; and in the fecond in- flance every other remedy is difcredited that former pradlice had prefu- med to fanflion; that a decided preference might be given to the faluta- ry influence of fermenting cataplafms. Without attempting to examine the particular merits of all thefe dif- ferent flaternents and unqualified affertions, I fhall humbly folicit the candid readerâ€™s attention to the only rational inference that this diverfity of opinion will admit of. If the bark is not an efficacious remedy, we mufl then acknowledge that all thofe fuccefsful cafes, where this medicine was depended upon, mufl have terminated fpontaneoufly; and if opium is the only remedy, then all thofe fuccefsful cafes, where opium was not given, muff have flopped fpontaneoufly ; and confequently, if opium was not given in the cafe related by Mr. Power, that muff alfo have termina- ted fpontaneoufly; but as in this cafe all the remedies commonly employ- ed were tried in vain, all former cafes muff have terminated fpontaneouf- ly, and this have been cured by the application of fermenting cataplafms. One circumftance particularly merits our attention; when the experi- ment had been once tried, and fermenting cataplafms had been ufed with fuppofed advantage, we are informed that the difeafe again returned. On this occafion it would certainly be reafonable to fuppofe, that as this new remedy had in the firfl inflance proved efficacious, it would have been immediately had recourfe to on a return of the difeafe. But from whatever motive they were again made ufe of, we meet with this fatisfac- tory information in the fequel that this mortification alfo, after other means had been firfl tried, was flopped by the fermenting cataplafms.

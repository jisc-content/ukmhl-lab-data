3o THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION It is to the wounded ftate of the parts alone, that I (hall refer as a caufe of the difeafe, for we either muft attribute the gangrene to the wounded ftate of the parts, or admit that the gangrene depended on fome other' caufe. But whatever may be the caufe, we muft confider the difeafe to have taken place, and then examine the method of treatment. We aretoldthat “the fanguine and bilious muft be lowered and emptied; and that the weak and debilitated muft be aflifted by fuch medicines as will add force to the vis vitas.” The word bilious, in its prefent fituation, I do not underftand; but fuppofing that bleeding and other evacuations might be neceflary to abate the preceding inflammation, gangrene once having taken place, fuch remedies muft be highly improper. If the fubjeft was fanguine and bilious before gangrene took place, he would not require to be lowered and emptied afterwards; weak and debilitated he muft cer- tainly be in this advanced ftage of the difeafe, and muft require the aflis- tance of fuch medicines as will add force to the vis vitas. It is therefore much to be lamented that our learned author has negleffed to mention^ what medicines his large experience had found adequate to this impor- tant purpofe. In the next page a regular plan of antiphlogiftic treatment is dire&ed for the inflammatory ftage of the difeafe, of which I believe anodynes are not intended to make a part; pain and irritation appear to me in this place to mark a fubfequent and feparate period, as pain and irritation are on this occafton faid to ftand in need of anodynes and the peruvian bark; fo that we here find that anodynes have changed their company; before they were affociated with the lancet, now they are united with the peruvian

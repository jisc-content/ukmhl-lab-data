The refult of Wifeman’s experience ftrongly points out the impropri- ety of amputation as a remedy in cafes of mortification; but when he at- tempts to give a theoretical opinion, he exprelfes himfelf in favour of this pra&ice. The firft cafe that he gives, in his chapter on gangrene and fphacelus, is a mortification in the arm in confequence of a gun-fhot wound *; but in this inftance the patient was permitted to die without amputation being ever mentioned; when from his own defcription there was certainly an opportunity of performing the operation, if it had been thought advifable.- The defcription of his pra&ice is clear and intelligible, but his theo- retical opinions are obfcure; and he feems to recommend amputation in compliance with the prejudices of the times, in oppofition to his own convi&ion. If Wifeman’s theoretical obfervations on this fubjefl be ex- amined with attention, it will appear evident that the whole is the offsprin of conjeffure; he recommends what he thinks would be advifable in fur cafes, but if he had been defcribing the evidence of his own praftice, the different events would have determined the inftability of his opinion. In one inffance, when he hates the queftion whether the amputation- ought to be done in the found part or the dead+, it is reafonable to fup- pofe he alluded to that period when the progrefs of the mortification was terminated^ bo M

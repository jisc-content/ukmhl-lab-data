O/t n PART OF SURGERY. oT / Mr. I. Hunter obferves that “ Gun-fhot wounds, from the circumftanct of commonly having a part killed, in general do not inflame fo readily as thofe from other accidents ; this backwardnefs to inflame will be in the proportion that the quantity of deadened parts bear to the extent of the wound, from which circumflance the inflammation is later in coming on, more efpecially when a ball paffes through a flefiiy part with great velo- city; becaufe there will be a great deal deadened, in proportion to the fize of the wound ; therefore inflammation in gun-fhot wounds is Iefs than in wounds in general, wherethe fame quantity of mifchiefhas been done'I * * * 5'.” Thus it is evident that they both agree in their account of the appear- ances, and in their opinion refpe&ing the flow progrefs of the inflamma- tory fymptoms. The plain reafon therefore why gun-fhot wounds do not inflame fo quickly after the accident, is, becaufe the parts mo ft in- jured are deprived of life and confequently incapable of inflammation. The inflammation takes place in the living parts that have received a lefs degree of injury for the purpofe of feparating’the dead parts; and the inflammation is in a lefs degree than if the parts were greatly irritated by the injury, which would be in proportion to the degiee of injury if the parts were not deprived of life. I have feen inflances of this kind in accidents from other caufes ; one I recolleft of a lacerated wound occafioned by the plank of a wooden bridge giving way as a very heavy man was pading over it, his leg flipt between the two planks, and a very large portion of the integuments and * I.

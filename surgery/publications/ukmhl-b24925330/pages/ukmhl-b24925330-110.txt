PHYSIOLOGY* 8-6 found that the feflion of the upper end was one grain and a half heavier than that of the lower, from which we muft infer that the upper end is largeft. If we examine the defcriptions and engraved reprefentations of former anatomifts, who fuppofedthat the arterial tubes were all conical, wefhall find that in this inftance the conical form of the artery is placed in a con- trary direction. J As a proof of the accuracy with which thefe experiments were conduct- ed, we are told that the artery was well warmed and placed in a horizon- tal pofition ; but we are not informed whether it was taken out of the neck of the camel, or whether they were both warmed together, neither are we informed whether the application of heat was moift or dry, and all thefe in my opinion are circumftances of confiderable importance; moift heat would relax thefe dead animal fubftances, but dry heat would contraCt them, and dry heat could not be impartially applied. If the queftion had refled alone on this fimple evidence, it would have been neceffary that all thefe particulars fhould have been accurately no- ticed; but as the experiment is repeated, the fallacy of this opinion will be more eafily deteCted. c( The carotid artery of another camel, meafur- ing three feet and a half in length, was found to fend off forty-four fmall branches, about the fize of the human intercoflal arteries; with one as large as the ulnar. Of this artery, a tranfverfe fe&ion of one inch in length, being taken from each end and weighed; that from the lower end was found to weigh two fcruples, fixteen grains and a half; while that from

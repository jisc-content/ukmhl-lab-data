PHYSIOLOGY. 73 There are fome circumftances that at firft view may feem to correfpond with the effects of elafticity; but, when the whole evidence is attentively examined, both in a flate of aflion, and in a hate of reft, by obferving the various operations of the vafcular fyftem during life, and the appearances after death, that elafticity will be found to be the effefts of mufcular pow- er. The manner in which aftream of blood is difcharged from a wounded artery evidently demonftrates, that the aftion of the arteries is increafed in proportion to their diftention. Thus when the arteries are in the extreme diaftole, the velocity of the blood is greateft; and the velocity continues to diminifh, during the fucceeding fyftole in proportion to the degree of contraft ion, until the fyftole is terminated by a frelh fupply of blood from the heart. But when the fupply from the heart is prevented either by a temporary fufpenfton, or final termination of the vital powers; when under fuch cir- cumftances the arteries have difcharged their whole contents, they then, become relaxed and their aftion ceafes. If then the contraftion of the arteries depended on elafticity, as their final contra&ion is fo complete as to difcharge all the blood into the veins, they would after death remain in the fame contra&ed ftate ; “for it is to be remembered, that elafticity in animals does not, like mufcular contrac- tion, depend on life; an elaftic body poffefling that quality as perfe&ly after death as before*.” * I, Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page io6» V It

PHYSIOLOGY. 64 When Harvey difcovered what is called the circulation of the blood, his explanations were fo clear and intelligible, as to free the fubjeft from all future doubt and uncertainty; and if the prefent fubjedl had been equally plain and felf evident, we fhould meet with equal uniformity of opinion. Mr. Hewfon obferves that the particles of the blood are not, as Father de la Torre fuppofed, annular or hollow rings, but that the blackifh fpot, which he imagined to be a perforation, is a folid body, the fides of which are filled with a fubtile fluid; but Mr. I. Hunter was of opinion that Mr. Hewfon, like the early obfervers, probably imagined more than he faw. A Mr. Falconer, who had been a pupil to Mr. Hewfon, repeated his experiments, and if I was to depend on the authority of a Angle evidence, without having examined any other book on this lubjedt, I fhould be rea- dy to acknowledge that the accuracy of his defcriptions would give ad- ditional teftimony to Mr. Hewfon’s opinions. But another and another ftill fucceeds, and Mr. Cavallo objects to thefe new opinions, and gives his teftimony in favour of the globular form of the red particles of the blood. Where then, in fuch a labyrinth, muft inquiry flop, and when muft this fyftem of confujion end? This great phiiofopher, like all his learned pre- deceflors, points out the abfurdity of fuch hypothetical conjeHures; and candidly acknowledges, “that the red particles of the blood have been at- tentively examined with the beft microfcopes, and the appearances, which have been partly obferved and partly fuppofed, have given origin to a variety

AMPUTATION’. 37 degrees it is improper, not only becaufe it is unnecefTary, but becaufe the difeafe, which was not in itfelf dangerous, would be rendered inevitably fo by the operation; and the obje&ions to the operation will increafe with the extent and degree of difeafe. For in cafes of fpreading gangrene not only the mortified limb, but the fyftem is in a hate of difeafe, a diathefis of the putrid kind muft under fuch circumftances pervade the whole. Thedifcharge from the injured part, and other local appearances will evidently mark the commencement of putridity; and the general fymp- toms point out with equal certainty the extent and degree of conftitutio- nal difeafe; to operate at this period would be laying an additional load on the finking powers of nature, without the leaft rational profpeft of ad- vantage; for if the whole fyftem is affefted, by amputation we only re- move a fmall and unimportant part of the difeafe, and if the difeafe is limited to any certain part, then the operation is no longer an objeft of our confideration. After afterting in behalf of his imaginary opponent, that, when the mortification is very extenfive, the patient will commonly fall a facrifice to the difeafe, whether the operation is performed or not: Mr. Bell, on the other fide of the queftion, obferves, “ that this opinion is diredlly con- trary to faff and experience, and contends for the propriety of amputating in cafes of extenfive gangrene but the argument is inaccurately ftated, for we certainly fhould have been informed under what circumftances re- covery was probable without amputation, and in what inftances the oper- ation was the only remedy.

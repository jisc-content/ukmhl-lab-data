INFLAMMATION AND *34 then it is not probable that we fhould meet with a difference of opinion refpefting the method of treatment; but as an apology for the free ufe of the lancet it will be faid, that we have got a new difeafe. It is only iji flight cafes where blind prejudice can exercife her doubts; but if we de- pend alone on the evidence of Do6lor Brown, the method of pra&ice will appear plain and rational; and as bleeding and purging are the moll pow- erful remedies in pulmonic inflammation, by thefe remedies we (hall be enabled to remove the moft powerful difeafe, and then the gout being fet at liberty may exhauft itfelf. I do not pretend to fay that bleeding is an antidote for the gout, but I never can fuppofe that bleeding can create it; if then the gout takes place an confequence of bleeding, if this evacuation does not create the gout, it muff fet the gout at liberty, that previoufly exifted in the conftitution, by removing a fuperior morbid affeftion. It is rather extraordinary that Mr. John Hunter, who delighted in the- oretical fpeculation, fhould, when he was treating on the gout, have neg- lefled fuch a favourable opportunity of gratifying a leading paffion. He has given his idea of the principle, under the title “ of difeafed a&ions as being incompatible with each other*;” and if his obfervations are con- formable to the laws of nature, the gout, under fuch circumftances, muff be fufpended, and not transferred. He fays, “ It appears to me beyond a doubt, that no two aftions can take place in the fame conftitution, nor in the fame part at one and the fame time; the operations of the body are limilar in this refpeft to aflions or motions in common matter.” I.

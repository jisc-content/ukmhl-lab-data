250 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. A patient of mine was Tome years ago taken ill in town of a putrid fe- ver, and was attended by two phyficians; one of whom (lands very high in his profefTion, and has defervedly an ample fhare of public efleem; the other is in conliderable practice, and I have heard him fpoken of with the greatefl refped. I mention thefe circumflances to fhew that, under the dire6lion of fuch eminent abilities, this young lady who was then a- bout nineteen years of age took two bottles of port a day for a fortnight, and in addition to this had feven blillers, and a finapifm to each foot. I do not prefume to fay that the method of treatment was improper; the patient recovered, and all the parties were highly gratified ; I only fay that I never met with a fimilar inftance in my own pra6!ice, and I never yet have had an opportunity of giving half the quantity of wine, or ever yet had occafion to make ufe of hair the quantity of blillers. On the fubje£l of putrid fevers we meet with a variety of opinions re- fpe£ling the ufe of the bark ; fome contend that it fhould be given from the firll commencement through the whole progrefs of the difeafe, whilfl others are of opinion that it is neceffary that the fever Ihould be abated before the bark is made ufe of. Now in both inflances it may have happened that each party may have formed a proper judgment of the evidence that came before them; but at the fame time it is to be remembered, that the nature and fymptoms of the difeafe may vary in different infiances, and each refpe&ive variety re- quire a different mode of treatment, according to the particular circum- ftances.

ss PHYSIOLOGY, In all defcriptions of the circulation that I have met with, the principal obje£I has been, to trace the courfe of the blood from the right fide of the heart to the left; and this has been fo frequently explained, that it would be an infult on thofe readers, who are already acquainted with the prefent hate of the fubjeft, to trouble them with a repetition. It is by the a£Hon of the arterial and venous fyftem, that the blood is conveyed from the left fide of the heart to the right, and this part of the fubje6l I prefume hill re- mains enveloped in obfcurity. If we view the arterial fyftem after death, we may confider the whole as a fet of tubes connected with each other, for the purpofe of conveying the blood from the heart to all the different parts of the body. But when we attentively examine the veflels in an a&iveftate during life, we (hall find that the arteries do not merely ferve as paflive condudtors of the blood, but that the regularity of the diftribu- tion depends on the mechanifm of the arterial fyftem. I do not here prefume to reafon againft plain matters of fa£I, or endea- vour to fupport an hypothefis againft the evidence of nature ; Mr. I. Hun- ter has already proved, that the fafts are not plain and felf-evident: I {hall therefore beg leave to give it as my opinion, that the arteries are cylindrical, and endeavour to prove the neceflity of theirbeing fo, becaufe fuch a fyftem of veflels will beft anfwer the purpofe of diftributing the blood, and poflefles the greateft uniformity and perfe&ion. For if the arterial tubes were all cones, the fmall ramifications branch- ing from the fides of larger cones, the whole would form an irregular af- , femblage, which it would be impoflible to reconcile with the fimplicity of nature. It is the bufinefs of the arteries to convey the blood to all parts of

THE PRINCIPLES OE 144 tid will Hill be in proportion to the diameter of the veflels ; and the ad- ditional quantity that palfes the external carotid, in confequence of the diminifhed refinance, will be furnilhed by the original trunk of the caro- tid artery. For as there is no divifion in the whole arterial fyflem by the interpo- fition of valves, as there is in the veins, every part of the arterial fyflem will contribute to the fupply. But if any doubts fhould arife refpe6ling the propriety of this flatement, I am ready for the fake of argument to admit, ie againft my better judg- ment,” that the diflribution to the internal carotid will be diminifhed du- ring the difcharge of blood, in proportion to the increafe to the external ramification; hill the pra&ice is equally obje&ionable. For if the quan- tity fent to the brain would be diminifhed for a few minutes, whilft the blood was flowing from the temporal artery, as this branch muft be obli- terated by the preffure neceffary to flop the difcharge, confequently the quantity of blood fent to the internal carotid after the operation would be increafed in a much greater proportion than it was before diminifhed; for, as the temporal artery would no longer receive either the increafed quantity or natural proportion, an additional fupply of blood would be fent to the brain during the fubfequent progrefs of the difeafe. But if we attend to the condufl of thofe who pretend to approve this method, we {hall find that they do not depend on arterial bleeding for the cure of difeafes, but preferibe it on certain occafions, perhaps for the pur- pose of giving an air of importance to their pra£lice; for if they confider- ed

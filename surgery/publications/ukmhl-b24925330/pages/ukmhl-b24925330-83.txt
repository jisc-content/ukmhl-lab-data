PHYSIOLOGY* 59 The quadruped is the animal to whom refpiration is the moft neceffary and where it is lead; under the influence of the will. Quadrupeds have warm blood; and in this clafs of animals conftant refpiration is fo necef- fary to life, that a very ihort fufpenfion of this important funflion will immediately put a ftop to all the vital powers. In thofe animals called amphibious, the blood is red but cold; in thefe the conftrufclion of the heart and lungs is very different from thofe of the quadruped: the blood does not all pafs through the lungs, and ref- piration is more under the command of the will. The effedls of refpira- tion on the red part of the blood are evident to our fenfes in both inftan- ces; bur. whatever effedls it may have on the other parts of the blood is yet unknown, in confequence of which Mr. I. Hunter concludes, that vifible effe&s are lefs than invifible, and that evident faÂ£is are of lefs im- portance than vifionary conje&ures. Though I do not wifh to have the red part of the blood deprived of its importance, I cannot fo implicitly fubfcribe to one of its inofl diflinguifh- ing titles. The red part of the blood has for more than a century been diftinguifhed by the term of red globules, and this was the only part of the blood that was at firfl fuppofed to be formed of globules ; but modern phyfiologiffs have attempted to improve on this original difcovery, and affertthat the chyle*, of which the blood is formed, is in the firft inflance itfelf formed of globular particles; and not only that the red part of the blood but aifothe lymph ana ierum are all formed of globules, and even the milk which is fecreted from the blood is of fimilar conilru&ion. * I, Hunter on gun Ihot wound?, page 7s, I exp C 61

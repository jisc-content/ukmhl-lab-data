AMPUTATION. 34 ed with; but what they have written is unalterable, and is the only evi- dence that deferves our attention. I muft acknowledge that, as far as I can judge, I know of no fuch parties, who have afted in oppofition to their own conviftion ; if they exifted amongft the writers on furgery they fhould have been pointed out.

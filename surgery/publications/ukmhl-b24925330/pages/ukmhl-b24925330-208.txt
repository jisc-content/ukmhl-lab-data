HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. 184 If we look back to the date when the bark was firft given, we (hall find that the confultation had limited the life of the patient to 24 hours; and perhaps for the purpofe of convincing pofterity, how well he was fatisfied with the propriety of this decifion, (for all authors expefl their works to prove immortal) Mr. Douglas defired the fervants, if his patient died in the night, to acquaint him early in the morning. But contrary to all ex- pectation the patient had a good night, and there was a furprifing altera- tion for the better by the next day. Here we mu ft recoiled, that the confultation met in the morning, but the bark was not given till evening; and as four dofes were taken before the next day at noon, we will fuppofe that it was taken at 8 and 12 in the evening, and at 4 and 8 in the morning. Now as he is faid to have had a fine night, the two firft dofes of the bark mu ft either have produced this effect, or the crifis muft have been fpontaneous, depending alone on the falutarv powers of nature, vis medicatrix nature. But under the idea that the medicines were inftrumental, why might not the Confe&io. Alkermes be fuppofed to contribute fome little on this occafion; whatever may be the powers of this medicine, I cannot fpeak from experience, having ne- ver yet had the gratification of feeing the compofition, or the fatisfa&ion of giving a fingle grain. But if we may depend upon the authority of others, it would be the height of fcepticifm to let this part of the prefcrip- tion pafs unnoticed. Let us here recollefl, that thepatient was fuppofed to be within 24 hours of his diffolution, and if the fymptoms were palpitation of the heart, fear, terror.

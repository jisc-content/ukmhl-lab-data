THE PRINCIPLES OP 44Â® in the arm; for, when both the temporal arteries have been opened, the practice is at an end. And as difeafes of the brain frequently require more than twice, or even thrice or four times bleeding, we muft then have fome other method to apply to. But independent of thefe confiderations, bleeding in the arm appears to me to be the moft efficacious; for if the objedl of bleeding be to diminiffi the power of the heart, and the impe- tus of the circulation, it is reafonable to fuppofe, that our objedf will be belt obtained by diminiffiing the fupply to the fountain head; whereas, by opening the temporal artery, we only cut off one of the diftant branches. I am ready to acknowledge that the quantity of blood, taken from the temporal artery, will diminiffi the plethoric Hate of the conftitution; but I contend that it will not either fo effediually or fo expeditioufly dimi- niffi the a&ion of the arterial fyftem. For as the blood is difcharged from a wounded artery by the contradlion of the whole arterial fyftem, thefe veffels will, during the evacuation, adapt themfelves to the quantity, and eonfequently their power of adlion will not be diminiffied in proportion to the lofs of blood. Whereas, by diminiffiing the fupply of blood to the heart by an evacuation from the veins, the main-fpring of the circulation will be deprived of part of its power, and the a&ion of the heart and arteries inftantly abated; by one method we attack the fource of adiion, by the other we only in a Angle inftance deftroy the effedi. But the vicinity to the feat of difeafe is fuppofed to point out the tem- poral artery as a part, from which the evacuation may be made with the moft advantage. It will be impoffible to form a rational opinion on this partofthefubjedl without a previous knowledge of the anatomy of the vaf- cular

PHYSIOLOGY. If we feparately examine thefe two plates of microfcopic reprefentati- on, one of which is faid to refemble the circulation of the blood in the tail of a fifh, the other the animalcules in femine mafculino, and then com- pare the information feparately taken, we (hall find that thefe two conjec- tural reprefentations will give the ftrongefl evidence of the fallacy of thefe experiments. If we give credit to one, we mull admit the other, and if we doubt the truth of one, they muff both fall together. Thus, by com- paring the refult of two experiments, we may be enabled to form a better judgment of the accuracy of each, and to fatisfy ourfelves whether they are, or are not, reprefentations of nature. But I am perfe&ly fatisfied without repeating them, and though my tafle may be called in quefiion, yet I mufl; candidly acknowledge the want of relifh for this fpecies of philofophical inveftigation. But perhaps it might prove a more pleafing amufement to the younger ftudent, who may be in- duced to repeat thefe experiments, to examine the truth of thefe repre- fentations, and try the evidence through the medium of his own fenfes. THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. THE a&ion of the vafcular fyftem is fo immediately aflfe&ed by a phlo- giftic diathefis, that this has generally been confidered an important ob- jed in all inveftigations of the pathology of inflammation.

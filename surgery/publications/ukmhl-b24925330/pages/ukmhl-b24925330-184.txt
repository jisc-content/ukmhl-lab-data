l6o HISTORICAL EVIDENCE* *e Perhaps it may feem flrange thus to difpute aDo&rine eftablifhed on what is called Matter of Fa£l; but I fhall here obferve, that in the Prac- tice of Phylic and Surgery, it is often exceedingly difficult to afcertain a Fa£l. Prejudice or want of Abilities fometime mifleads us in our Judg- ment where there is evidently a right and a wrong; but in certain Cafes to diftinguifh how far the Remedy and how far Nature operate, is probably above our difcernment: In Gangrenes particularly, there is frequently fuch a Complication of unknown Circumflances as cannot but tend to de- ceive an unwary obferver. Mortifications anfmg from mere Cold, Com- preffion, or Stricture, generally ceafe upon removing the Caufe, and are therefore feldom proper Cafes for proving the power of Bark; Howe- ver there are two kinds of Gangrene, where Internals have a fairer trial; thofe are a fpreading Gangrene from an internal Caufe, and a fpreading Gangrene from violent external Accidents, fuch as Gun-fhot Wounds, compound Fra6lures, &c. Yet even here we cannot judge of their Ef- fect with abfolute certainty; for fometimes a Mortification from internal Caufes is a kind uf critical Difordcr: There fcems to be a certain portion of the Body deftined to perifli and no more; of this we have an infinity of Examples brought into our Hofpitals, where the Gangrene flops at a particular Point, without the leafl affifiance from Art; the fame thing happens in the other Species of Gangrene from violent Accidents, where the Injury appears to be communicated to a certain Diflance and no far- ther, though by the way I fhall remark in this place, contrary to the re- ceived Opinion, that Gangrenes from thefe Accidents, (where there has been no previous ftraitnefs of Bandage), are as often fatal as thofe from internal caufes. As I have here ftated the Fa&; we fee how difficult it is to afcertain the

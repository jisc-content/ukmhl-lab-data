167 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. This laft cafe was a mortification of the integuments from diftention and debility, and it is very evident from this fhort defcription, that the patient had a difeafed liver; under which circumftances the bark was in- admiftible, and the event which was not in the power of medicine to guard againft explained the whole. But Mr. Amyand concluded with expref- fing his unlimited confidence of the powers of the bark in mortifications from an internal caufe, though Mr. Rufhworth had juft before given a con- trary opinion. I fhall not attempt to reconcile this difference of opinion, I only wifh to obferve that the want of coincidence muft invalidate their authority. Mr. Douglas in the fame year publifhed two cafes of mortification of the toes and feet, in one the bark was given and the patient recovered; in the other the bark was not given and the patient died. This pamphlet contains only forty-eight pages; but if any one will aflert that he can read this little book without great entertainment and confiderable inftru&ion, I fhall prefume to obferve in reply that fuch a reader muft be void of tafte and deftitute of penetration. There is certainly an uncommon de- gree of plainnefs pervading the whole, but it is adorned with that grace- ful fimplicity, which always decorates the truth. The plan and progrefs of the confultation, the prejudice of the phyfician, his conteft with the fur- geons, the intrufion of a friend, the impertinence of the lawyer, the anx- iety of a prefumptive heir. See. &c. prefent a wide and fertile field offpe- culation for the moralift, the hiftorian, or philofopher. But if it does not appear in the fame pleafing light to others, I fhall be happy, when op- portunity ferves, to write a volume of commentaries on Mr. Douglasâ€™s little pamphlet. As

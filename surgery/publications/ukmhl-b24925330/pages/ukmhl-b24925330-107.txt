PHYSIOLOGY* 83 hypothecs, which to me appears unanfwerable; that is, that if thea&ionof thefe valves depended upon their being brought into right lines, it would be neceffary that the aorta fhould always poffefs the fame degree of plen- itude, and that its dillention (hould always be the fame. But after great lolfes of blood, when the arteries were lefs diftended, thefe valves would not be brought into right lines; and as we have no reafon to fufpeCt the perfection of their operation, either in a full or exhaufled ftate of the fyftem, it is evident that the clofing of the valves does not depend on their extenfion by the diafloleof the artery. Asa protection againft this objection, Mr. I. Hunter obferves that â€œthe quantity of blood that is juft fufficient to keep the animal alive, is fuffici- ent to diftend the artery fo as to fhut the valves but if the valves are to be brought into right lines, it will be neceffary that the expanfion of the artery fhould always be the fame, or that the valves fhould be elaftic, and admit of different degrees of diftention. We find after fainting fits, when the aClion of the heart and arteries has been for fome time fufpended, and the blood all accumulated in the veins, that the firft perceptible pulfations, let them be ever fo weak, are not im- perfect, and in cafes were this fainting takes place from confiderable lofs of blood, the evidence is particularly applicable to the point in queftion. Inftances of this kind we frequently meet with in cafes of uterine haemorr- hage, when the lofs of blood is very confiderable; yet if the pulfe is ex- amined under fuch circumftances, let it be ever fo feeble, we do not meet with any evidence to induce us to fufpeCt that the operation of the femi- * I, Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 162, lunar

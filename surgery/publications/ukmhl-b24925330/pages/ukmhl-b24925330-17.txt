PREFACE. ix the fcientific branches of philofophy. The former I con- fideras the experimental apparatus, the inftruments of inquiry, the powers by which the fecret operations of nature are dif- clofed ; the latter comprehends the arrangement of fa£ls al- ready known, and the invefbgation of correfponding phenomena by analogy and dedudlion. And even here we fhall meet with equal imperfedlions. They are not little objects that will now engage our atten- tion ; the myfterious funflions of animal nature, and the me- chanifm of the univerfe, will here become the fubje£ls of our contemplation. Thefe may certainly be claffed with the fublime and beautiful; and that we may meet with a writer equal to the fubje£f, I Rail refer to one about a century back, when literature fhone forth with full meridian fplen- dour. The only author I fhall notice is Dotlor Mead, who as a writer mud certainly command refpefl, and who was without doubt poffefled of confiderable literary accom- d. plifhments

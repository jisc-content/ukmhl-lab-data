360 THE OPERATIVE * Wifemanâ€™s. Surgery, page -441. redrefs. And the ftrong terms, in which Wifeman * urges the neceffity of early amputation in cafes that are likely to terminate in mortification, evidently (hew how well he was convinced of the inefficacy of this ope- ration during the progreffive ftate of the difeafe. Such was the ftate of this fubjeCl one hundred and thirty years ago,, and the ufe which Wifeman had made of his own experience was a high compliment to his profeffional abilities and the perfpicuity of his under- {landing. In this ftate the queftion continued until it was more accurately exam- ined by Mr. Sharp; but after he had cleared up the whole and defended his opinion by a fyftem of fatisfaClory arguments, ftil! the inaitentive too frequently fell into the errors of former opinions. To obviate this unpardonable violation of rational practice, and for the purpofe of an- fwering Bilguer, Mr. Pott urged the importance of the fubjetl in more plain and pointed language: but even this was not fufficient, for, as if it was the natural propenfny of human nature to prefer falffiood to truth, darknefs to light, and error to perfection, it feems to have been the lead- ing objeCt of modern writers to bewilder themfelves and embarrafs others. I flatter myfelf I have already proved that the opinions of Wife- man, though fometimes erroneous and in many inftances imperft 61, are {till intelligible; and I fhall now endeavour to ffiew that the opinions of Mr. I. Hunter are not only equally erroneous and imperfeCl, but in ma- 31 y, inftances unintelligible.

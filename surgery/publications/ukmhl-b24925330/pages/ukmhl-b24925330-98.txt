PHYSIOLOGY® 74 The It is the operation of this eladic power that is fuppofed to counteraft the mufcular contraction, and this is particularly mentioned as a caufe of their expanfion*; but if the arteries poflefled a power of expanflon in* dependent of the preflure of the blood, the velocity of a dream of blood from a wounded artery would diminifh during the operation of this ex- panfive eladicity; and if the impetus of the blood coming from the heart was inferior, or only equal, to this eladic power, the blood would ceafe to move in a found artery, or flow from a wounded one, during this part of their diaftole. And whatever was the proportion of thefe two oper- ations, the interrupted velocity of a dream of blood from a wounded ar- tery would give evidence of its effeft. So that I think it is evident that the arteries are neither expanded, nor contracted by eladicity, but that their contraftion is mufcular, which is counteracted by the power of the heart, the blood ferving as a connefting medium between the two; for as the blood never ceafes to flow from a wounded artery, fo the arteries never ceafe to aft fo long as they are fupplied with blood from the heart; but being deprived of all fupply, they by their final contraftion difcharge their contents, which are received into the veins, and their aftion ceafes. If then the arteries never ceafe to aft when the blood is prefent, and im- mediately become paflive when their contents are difcharged, it is evident that the caufe of aftion depends on the prefence of the blood; and as they are found empty and in a date of relaxation after death, their aftion du- ring life mud depend on mufcular power; for if the power of eladicity does not depend on life, the arteries would not become relaxed after death. * “The contrafted fUte of an artery srifes from the aft’on of the mufcular power, and is again re- {lored to the natural Hate by the elaftic.” 1.

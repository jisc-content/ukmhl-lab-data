PHYSIOLOGY. 8 4 The lunar valves is imperfe&Iy performed. And if I may prefume to give my opinion in oppofition to Mr. I. Hunter, I fhould think that the lefs the aorta was diftended, the more the valves would be difpofed to approach each other. But it may here be proper to obferve, that it is of no importance to the queftion before us in what refpe&s my opinion may differ from that of Mr. I. Hunter; the queftion is, whether or no he has explained the ani- mal funftions with fufficient accuracy to eftablifli a theory of difeafes on firft principles? Iam ready to acknowledge that a much more limited difcuflion would have been fufficient for this purpofe; but the circulation of the blood is an important part of the animal ceconomy, and certainly the obfervations of one of the firft anatomifts of the age, on a fubjeftfo particularly inter- efting and foimperfedfly underftood, muft be thought worthy of attention. We have now conduced the blood through the femilunar valves into the aorta, through whofe branches it is diftributed to all parts of the bo- dy. It is then taken up by the veins, and conduced by the afcending and defcending cava to the right fide of the heart. This progrefs of the blood has been long known, but the manner in which it moves through the arteries and the veins, and the principles that regulate its motion, feem yet to be but imperfectly underftood. The fyftole of the heart and arteries gives motion to the blood, but the diftribution and velocity depend on the magnitude and form of the dif- ferent parts of the arterial fyftem.

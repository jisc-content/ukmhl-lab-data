THE OPERATIVE S5° It is this which marks the diftin&ion between the partial know' of the pra&ical burgeon and the more ekteniive views of fcientifk in- quiry ; and it too frequently happens that, becaufe the former {hall have accidentally noticed the operations of nature in a {ingle inftance, his opinion fhall be preferred to that of the man of fcience, who, with more enlarged views, attempts to invefligate the whole. But whether the fci- i ence of I. Hunter, or the praflice of Wifeman has the lead, I hope it will ftill be confidered a great fharae amongft army burgeons, if the bufi- nefs of extraflion is deferred to the next morning, whenever this opera- tion is indifpenfably necelfary. On the propriety of early amputation Wifeman is equally pointed, clear, and decif \ e ; he not only appeals to the Bate of the body, but he confiders the mind at that time in a proper {late to meet the conflift. He fays, “In heat of Fight, whether it be at. Sea or Land, the Chirurgeon ought to confider, at the firft Dre ding, what poflfbility there is of pre- ferving the wounded Member; and accordingly, if there be no hopes of faving it, to make his Amputation at that inflant whiid the Patient is free of Fever, &c It is alniod impoffible that an opinion fhould be ex- preffed in language more plain, and intelligible; and in many other parts of his work he gives his opinion with equal perfpicuity. In the defcription that he has gi ven of a wound in the joint of the knee, he fays, “ This Wound was mortal the very minute it was infli&ed, and the party ought then to have been difmembered: But fuch propar- fais were not admitted of in the firft dreffing, whilft there was, as they ■* Wifcmin’t Surgery, page 441. judged.

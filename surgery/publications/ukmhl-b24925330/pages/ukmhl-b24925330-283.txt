MEDICINAL TREATMENT. ^59 I was to receive in town, the fair profpefl immediately began to cloud, and I became apprehenfive that I fhould not meet with any certainly ef- ficacious method of preventing mortification. But perhaps the quantity of bark ufually given on fuch occafions with fuccefs was not then afcertained, as this cafe happened two or three years previous to the date of Do&or Reynoldsâ€™s obfervations. There is one circumflance worthy of attention on this occafion, that the cafe before us is very iimilar to that defcribed by Sir James Earle, in which he firfl fucceeded in his new method of treating compound frac- tures and luxations; and it may alfo be proper to obferve that, though this cafe was in fome refpefls favourable for amputation after the commence- ment of mortification, yet fo well were they all convinced of the ineffica- cy of fuch praftice that the propofal was never mentioned. The difference between external and internal mortifications is fo great, that in a praflical view there feems to be very little refemblance except in name. In all cafes of vifceral mortification, as the parts are effential to life, their deflru&ion mufl be produff ive of more fpeedy death; for which reafon it mufl be obvious that in fuch infiances the objefl is to prevent the cifeafe taking place, and not either the curing of mortification when it has taken place, or even the flopping of its progrefs. If we compare the refpeffive indications, we fhall find in the former in- fiance that bleeding is feldom neceffary and purging is to be ufed with caution, but opium is admiffible in every period of the difeafe, and bark is

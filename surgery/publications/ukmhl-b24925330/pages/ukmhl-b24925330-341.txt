MEDICINAL TREATMENT* 3*7 efFe&s. I do not wifli to depreciate the ufe of fermenting liquors in pu- trid fevers, as I am well convinced, from repeated experience, of their falutary powers, and have at the time I am writing a patient under my care, who has been taking new ale out of the working vat for fome days, with the ftrongeft marked fymptoms of its good effedls ; it is thedefnrip- tion and not the remedy that I difapprove. But thefe examples may ferve to prove that truth is frequently the offspring of error, and valuable difcoveries are fometimes produced by a happy jumble of miftakes. The next cafe was under the care of fome apothecary in the county of Leicefter, who at laft finding every effort to be of fervice to his patient baffled, he told Mr. Cartwright that he confidered it to be a loft cafe, and that in his opinion the man would not iurvive twenty-four hours. It muft appear rather fingular that there fhould be fuch a coincidence of opinion in all the defcriptions of dangerous cafes ; if we look back to the cafe of mortification defcribed by Mr. Douglas, the life of the patient was then limited to twenty-four hours, the other cafe, where the patient died, was limited to twenty-four hours, and this is limited to the fame fpace of time. At this critical period two fpoonfuls of yeaft were given, and we are informed “ that in fifteen minutes the pulfe began to get compofed and full, and in thirty-two minutes from taking it, he was able to get up from his bed and walk.” After this fatisfafiory obfervation Mr. Cartwright then adds, “at the expiration of the fecond hour, I gave him a bafon of fago, with a good deal of lemon, wine, and ginger in it. He ate it with an appetite. In another hour I repeated the yeaft ; an hour afterwards I gave the bark as before; at the next hour he had food; next had another dofeofyeafl; and then went to bed : it was nine o’clock. He told me he had a good night, and was recovered.” 4i After

By thefe means I hope we fhall be able to analyze the fubjeft, and inveRigate the narrow limits of this branch of the profeffion. Refpe&ing the ufe of external applications, they will vary according to circumRances; and for the purpofe ofilluRration let us firR fuppofe the cafe to be a contufion of one of the extremities, without either wound of the integuments, or fraffure of the bone.

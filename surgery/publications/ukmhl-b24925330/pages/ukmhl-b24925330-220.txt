196 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE.’ the remedies that were made ufe of. The firft: inftance of fuccefs is de- fcribed with accuracy, but the fecond, in which the progrefs of the difeafe was fuppofed to be hopped by three dofes of the bark, appears lefs fatis- fa&ory ; and if we attend to his fubfequent reafoning, we fhall weet with fome diverfity of opinion. Mr. Shipton in one place thinks it is pretty evident, that nothing is to be afcribed to a peculiar difpojition of the humours, to fome unknown dio- fyncracia, to fpontaneous remitting of the fymptoms, or a fortuitous cri- bs; and yet he afterwards obferves, that from the above-mentioned hifto- ries it is worth obferving, that though in fome of them the wounds were the immediate caufe of a gangrene, yet in all of them, the chief and prin- cipal caufe feems to be taken from the hate and condition of the humours; “and confequently, that internal remedies ratherthan the ufual external ones, anfwer the purpofe with greater difpatch and fafety.” This method of cafe writing may ferve the purpofe of empiricifm; and may impofe up- on the credulous, or amufe the gaping multitude; but will neither fatis- fy the philofopher, nor clear the caufe of truth. I have thus endeavoured to examine the bafis, on which this important fubjeft was firft eltablilhed; and if we review the evidence, we mull: cer- tainly acknowledge the fallacy of this fpecies of reafoning on medical fub- je£ls. In the firft place Rufhworth, Amyand, Douglas, Shipton, and ma- ny others have endeavoured to prove that the bark is a certain remedy in all cafes of mortification. About twenty years afterwards, Mr. Sharp aflerts, that thefe hiftorians were all deceived: and having met with fre- quent inltances where mortification ftops fpontaneoufly, he gives it as his

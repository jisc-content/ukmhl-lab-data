PART OF SURGERY. 339 health are in a fit Rate to bear amputation but this opinion appears to me to want rational protePion. For my own part I cannot fee any rea- fon why a perfon in full health and vigour fhould not fupport the lofs of a limb better than after being reduced by a long and lingering difeafe. The inflammation fubfequent to amputation is not likely to produce dangerous h raptoms except it terminates in mortification, and I believe that is a circumRance which will very rarely happen if the operation is performed fufificiently early ; but if inflammation has taken place in con- fequence of the injury, the Rate of the queRion is then altered, and the operation is certainly improper. But Mr. I. Hunter alfo urges the lofs of blood as an objection, which appears to me to be an argument againR his own opinion ; for if Rrong health is confidered a reafonable objection in one in Ranee, the lofs of blood t 'which would reduce the Rate of the confutation to a lower fian- dard mufl certainly be advantageous; and this argument muR be confi- dered the perfection of medical obfeurity, to urge a Rate of full health and vigour, and an exhauRed Rate of the conRitution in confequence of a lofs of blood, as fimilar objections againft the propriety of amputation. But fueh are the arguments that are brought forwards for the exquifite gratification of propagating thefe fublime productions, and the eftablifh- ment of doctrines that are only calculated to add darknefs to the unintel- ligible myReries of the profe/lion. * I.

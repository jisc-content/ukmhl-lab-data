MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 28 l inftaoces fo influenced by difeafe as to return the contents of the ftotnach and inteftines by the mouth. In cafes of hernia the mechanical obftruc- tion that prevents the paflage through the bowels is plain and felf evident; but in many other inftances the caufe is more obfcure. Doftor Cullen obferves *, that the fpafmodic conftriction of a part of the inteftine, in cafes of fpafmodic colic, is evident in difleftion; but if the difeafe had only been fpafmodic, I fhould have thought that all the ap- pearances of fpafm would have terminated with life, and fhould for that reafon be induced to infer that the permanent appearances after death mu ft be the effedh of inflammation, although fpafm might be the firft ori- ginal difeafe; in confequence of which we (hall have the fymptoms of fpafmodic colic in the firft inftance, and the appearance of inflammation after death. When obftrudlion takes place in confequence of fpafmodic ftriÂ£ture9 or in cafes of hernia, if the whole difeafe was limited to this obftru&ion, then it would be probable that opiates might be given with a rational profpedt of fuccefs; but as in the firft inftance inflammation is fuppofed to take place previous to the appearance of the iliac paftion, and as in cafes of hernia the difeafe is not in general limited to the parts, it is ftill ne- ceftary that opiates fhould be given with the greateft caution, and not without the molt critical attention to the nature and period of the dif- eafe ; as it appears evident, even from the accounts before us, that the inverted adlion of the ftomach and bowels depends on an inflammatory affedlion. * Cullen, vcl. 14. page 22.

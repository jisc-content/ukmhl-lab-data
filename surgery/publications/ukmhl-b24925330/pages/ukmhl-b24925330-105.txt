81 PHYSIOLOGY. The X Mr. Chefelden fays, <£Xn a woman that died of a dropfy, X found the valves of the aorta quite covered with chalk-flones, which not buffering the valves to do their office, the left ventricle of the heart was conffantly overcharged with blood, and diffended to above twice its natural bignefs*.531 It is very difficult to form an accurate judgment of the perfe6iion of the mechanifm of t.hefe organs by an anatomical examination of their flruc- ture after death; but we may conclude that the different parts perform their fundiions completely, if we meet with no evidence to the contrary. Mr. I. Hunter obferves that “the valves of the pulmonary artery do not do their duty fo completely as thofe of the aorta ; for in them we do not find the corpora-fefamoideafBut infleadof fuppofing that the valves of the pulmonary artery do not do their duty, becaufe the corpo- ra-fefamoidea are wanting, I fhould rather conclude that, in this inffance, this particular ftrudiure of the valves is not neceffary; at the fame time, I fee no reafon for queffioning the perfedlion of the mechanifm, or the cer- tainty of its effedt; and the variety only proves, that they are neceffary in one inffance, but not in the other. ✓ We now proceed to “figure the fecond, which fhews the artery in its diaffole, where the three valves run nearly into ffraight lines, making an equilateral triangle of the area of the aorta. But as their edges are round- ed, and the bodies of the valves make a curve inwards, they by thefe mean& fill up in part this triangular fpace, and the corpora-fefamoidea fill up the other part. In this way the wholeof the area of the artery is filled upj.” * Chefelden’s anatomy, fifth edition, page 182. + I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 162. JI. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 161.

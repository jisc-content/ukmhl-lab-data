â– r. r, ; PART OF SURGERY. oJ1 fees of tills kind that particularly merit our attention, in which operations may be unneceffarily performed, the patient ultimately do well, and the -error not detedied. As the operation for the bubonocele is made ufe of as a remedy for mortification, I (hall firfl attempt to point out the diffi- culty of determining when this operation becomes neceffjry. When we confider that all thefe fubjedls have been fo repeatedly dif- cuffed by writers of the firfl abilities, it may at firfl view appear both pre- fumptuous and unneceffary to make any additional obfervations. Before the anatomy of the parts was generally known, a critical explanation of that part of the fubjebl was well worthy the attention of the public; but the anatomical writers have in general confined their views to the form, connexion, and flrudture of the parts, and their obfervations are too much limited to the mechanical part of the fubjedl; and though anatomy and phyfiology are fuppofed to go hand in hand, we feldom find that much attention has been paid to the firfl principles of the vital powers, or that the nature and progrefs of morbid a diions have had a due (hare of atten- tion. The mechanical parts of the fubjedl are lefs difficult of invefligation, and with propriety become the firfl objedlof our attention. But the dif- fediion of a dead body, let it be ever fo accurately performed, will not of itfelf be Efficient to give us clear ideas of the firfl principles of difeafe, or lead us to a rational method of cure. If I fhould be accufcd of only taking a partial and irnperfedl view of fome collateral obj.ais A -t n - rally prefent themfclves on this occafion, I Hi all beg leave to anfwer Lh~t i. was not my intention to write a fyflem of furge^y, but lather iu pc - ;t out

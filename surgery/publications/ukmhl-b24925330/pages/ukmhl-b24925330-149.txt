125 THE EFFECTS OF BLEEDING. Urfl or fecond has this appearance, the next quedion is how far we mud proceed, I anfwer, until we have dedroyed the difeafe; and this may hap- pen before the dzy date of the blood ceafes. But I have frequently con- tinued the ufe of bleeding after the dzy date of the blood has difappeared, where an increafe of fymptomshas the next day induced me to bleed again, and the blood has been drongly marked with dze. I well remember an indance of this kind, it was a cafe of acute rheumatifm ; I had bled my pa- tient twelve times, the lad of which had not the lead dzy appearance; the fymptoms increafed the fecond day after the twelfth bleeding, I took away about a pound more blood which was drongly marked with dze, the difeafe in confequence fubfided, and the patient rapidly recovered. Now this I condder a complete anfwer to Dr. Heberden’s queries; he fays “ if one repetition of bleeding be indicated, (by the dzy appearance) will not its continuance plead as drongly for a fecond and third, and where fhall we dop? ” The anfwer is obvious, for if bleeding is the remedy, and the difeafe continues, the fame remedy mud be repeated until the difeafe ceaf- es ; I did not hedtate to bleed becaufe the lad blood was not fizy, nor did I continue to bleed becaufe the thirteenth bleeding was drongly marked; but I ceafed to bleed, becaufe the difeafe fubfided, and it was no longer necedary. Sydenham obferves, that he feldom cured a pleurify with lefs than the lofs of forty ounces of blood ; but I think it is a quedion of more impor- tance, to what extent bleeding may be continued, and what quantity may be taken, in defperate cafes, with a rational probability of fuccefs : and this is a fubjefr of fuch delicacy, that in all probability it will never be expofedto public view, as it is, in my opinion, what words cannot deferibe.

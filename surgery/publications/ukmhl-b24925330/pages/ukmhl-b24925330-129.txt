GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. D d If ( IO5 preceded by inflammation, and is not peculiar to old age; and yet, if we attentively examine the whole paragraph, we fhall find that it is the mor- tification of the toes and feet which is here alluded to; but it is evident, that the writer has exprefled himfelf as if he ftudioufly endeavoured to dif- guifehis knowledge of what Mr. Pott had previoufly faid upon this fub- jea. In the firfl: feaion of mortification, we are informed that his *obferva- tions are to be limited to that kind of mortification which is preceded by inflammation ; but whether we attend to the defcription of the difeafi’, or the method of treatment, we fhall find the whole crowded together in a promifcuous aflemblage of unintelligible confufion. But admitting that it is to that fpecies of difeafe which is preceded by inflammation, that our attention is on this occafion direfted; I fhall now examine what infor- mation is to be obtained refpedling the method of treatment. In the firfl place Mr. I. Hunter fuppofes, that “ in inflammations which terminate in mortification, there is no increafe of power, but, on the con- trary, a diminution of it.;” and then adds, “it is plain, from the common praftice, that the weaknefs has been attended to; but it is plain that the increafed a&ion has been overlooked; and, therefore, the whole aim has been to increafethe a6lion in order to remove the weaknefs. The peru- vian bark, confe&io cardiaca, ferpentaria, e61. have been given in large quantities, as the cafe appeared to require, or the conftitution could bear; by which means an artificial or temporary appearance of flrength has been produced, while it was only an increafed a61ion.” * I.

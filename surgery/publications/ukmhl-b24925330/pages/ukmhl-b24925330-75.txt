PHYSIOLOGY, Sp- latter feems to occupy his principal attention* and is reprefented as the moll important part of the circulating fluids. The procefs of coagula- tion is particularly noticed, and reprefented as the bafis of feveral of the animal fun&ions; as if the animal aftions were included in fome analo- gous operation, fuch for inftance as the change of fluids into folids, and even the accretion and increafe of different parts of the animal body. But this is evidently reafoning on falfe principles, as the operations of the animal mechanifm are not analogous to the chemical operations that take place in inanimate matter; or the changes that take place in animal matter, in confequence of parting with its vital principle. And whatever may be the merit of his conjeftures, the manner in which he concludes this part of thefubjeft evidently determines the imbecility of his arguments. After examining the progrefs of coagulation under different circumftan- ces, and in various points of view, he concludes by giving to the blood confcioufnefs and the power of volition, to regulate the bufinefs of coag- ulation, for “good purpofes on neceffary occafions*;” and fums up the whole, by givinghis opinion that “it coagulates from an impreflion of its fluidity being no longer neceffary; it then coagulates to anfwer the ne- ceffary purpofe of folidity.” But we may as well fuppofe that the freezing of water depends on an impreflion of the neceflity; or if, for the fake of more ftri£l analogy, we confine our obfervations to the changes that take place in extravafated * I.

146 THE PRINCIPLES OF But as the blood is feat from the heart to all parts of the body by the arteries, and is brought back to the heart by the veins, the immediate con- fequence ofbleeding mull therefore be to deprive the heart of part of the returning blood. And whether thebloodis taken from a large vein by a lan- cet, or from a fmall one by a leech, inthisrefpeXtheeffeX will be the fame; but if, according to what I believe is the general opinion, the cffeXs on the conditution are increafedby the expedition with which the evacuation is made, that method (hould be preferred by which the larged quantity of blood is taken in the (horted fpace of time. In inflammatory affeXions of the brain, lungs, Or liver, as the external veins have no immediate con- nexion with the internal parts, the only effeXs of topical bleeding mud be to prevent the return of a certain quantity of blood to the heart, and confequently cannot produce any particular efleX as a topical application, Mr. John Hunter feems fufficiently apprehenfive of the difficulty of defending thedoXrineof topical bleeding by the laws of the circulation, and has endeavoured to illuftrate the propriety of this praXice on very different principles; and as his authority defervedly (lands high in the opinion of the public, I (hall now proceed to examine fome of his obfer- vations on this fubjeX. He afferts that topical bleeding produces the * greateft effeX with the lead lofs of blood, but has not given a Angle argument in fupport of his opinion. Now this appears to me contrary to the evidence of dailv ex- perience ; for if a pound of blood be taken away from the arm in a few minutes, fainting is frequently the immediate confequence; but if the fame * I, Hunter on gun-fliot wounds, page 340. quantity

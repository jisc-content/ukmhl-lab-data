392 THE OPERATIVE out and explain fuch parts of the fubjefl as feem to have efeaped the notice of my predeceflors. What I contend for is, that there is much lefs difficulty in performing an operation than judging with ciitical accu- racy when it fhould take place. In the prefent inftance it is a fubjefl on which it is impoffible to decide with certainty. For in all thofe cafes of hernia, where mortification does take place, it mull be evident that the operation was too long delayed ; but in all thofe cafes, where the operation is performed previous to the com- mencement of mortification, it will be impoffible to determine w7ith cer- tainty that the operation was abfolutely necelfary, except in fuch inflan- ces where adhefion had taken place and reduction was impoffible,, Let us fuppofe that bleeding, cathartic glyfters, the warm bath, and purgative medicines, had all been made ufe of to no purpofe; and, in.ad- dition to thefe remedies, let us fuppofe that every rational attempt had been made by the hand of the furgeon to promote reduftion. We will fuppofe further that the inieflion of tobacco-fmoke had been made ufe of peranum, and that a whole ounce of tobacco had been confumed on this occafion without the leafl perceptible advantage; it would even un- der fuch circumllances be wrong to conclude, that the hernia was irre- ducible and that the operation was the lafl refource we had to flee to; for Mr. Pott mentions a cafe where all this was done without fuccefs. But he informs us that the inje6lion was Hill continued, and that thecon- fumption of two ounces produced the defired effett. The cafe is Ihort and abounds with inflru6live information; and, as it comes from high au- thority, I fhall give it as evidence of thedifficulty of forming an opinion with

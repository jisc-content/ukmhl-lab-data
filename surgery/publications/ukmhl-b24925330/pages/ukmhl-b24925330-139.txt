&UN-SHOT WOUNDS*- 115 patient can bear the application. Perhaps Mr. I. Hunter would in fuch cafes have preferred a cold bath to a warm one, but on this occafion the almoft unlimited confidence with which he was favoured might have found its bounds, as it would have been highly neceffary to convince the patient of the propriety of the meafure, before he fubmitted to a method of treat- ment fo repugnant to the didiates of his own fenfations. But there is a cafe of inflammation of the bowels that frequently ends in mortification, where cold applications may perhaps be made ufe of with advantage. The infiance I now allude to is ftrangulated hernia, but here the particular circumftances fhould not pafs unnoticed; if the application of cold produces falutary effedis in fuch cafes, it is not by abating the in- flammation, but by diminifhing the bulk of the inclofed flatus, and by that means abating the tenfion of the parts, and though the relaxation may be momentary, ftill during that fhort interval the hernia may be returned. I do not mention the application of cold in this inftance, as a method I fhould myfelf make ufe of in common cafes, or as a pradlice that I fhould in general recommend; I only notice this occurrence of circumftances for the fake of explaining in what cafes cold applications may be made ufe of with fafety, and fometimes with fuccefs. This is certainly an inflam- mation of the bowels, and an inftance that frequently ends in mortifica- tion; but the inflammation connedfed with hernia bears no analogy to that without it. Thefe concurring circumftances not only change the na- ture of the difeafe, but alfo require a different method of treatment and produce very different confequences, though the ultimatum may in fome refpedts prove the fame.

CHIRUROXCAL TREATMENT. 237 onal dimulus of frefh dredings, and the inevitable pain that all this bu- finefs mull occafion, with certainty increase the danger without the mod aidant probability ol advantage? I have taken this review of the treatment of compound frafture, for the purpofe of examining fome of the mod formidable combinations of the effects of external injury. But, in cares ofgun-fhot wounds, in addition to violent contufion, lafceration and frafture, it frequently happens that the wounded parts are filled with extraneous fubdances. Much has been faid by former writers on this fubjeft, refpefting the neceffity of thefe ex- traneous fubdances being removed; and when it can be done with eafe and fafety, it fhould certainly be confidered the fird objeft of chirurgical at- tention. But when the date of the injured parts is fuch, that the opera- tion of ext raft ion is liable to be attended with either difficulty, or danger, it will certainly be right to examine the probability of fuccefs, and confi- der whe'ther the advantages refulting from the removal of thofe extrane- ous fubdances will preponderate againd the danger of the operation. In cafes of gun-fhot wounds the extraftion of the ball feems to be the fird objeft of public attention; whereas it is a quedion of much more im- portance to determine the extent of the injury, to a [â€™certain what parts are wounded, and in what degree thefe parts are necedary to life. If the wounded parts are become indamed, every attempt to extraft the ball will much increafe the danger, in confequence of which the fuccefsful termi- nation will in a great meafure depend on the didance of time fubfequent to the period when the accident took place. And I confider this a fub- jeft of fuch delicacy, that every time the dredings are removed, and the N n n wounded

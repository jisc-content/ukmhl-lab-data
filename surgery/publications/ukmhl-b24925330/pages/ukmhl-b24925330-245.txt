When a part is once dead, it will be in vain to attempt to refiore that part to life; our objeft is to prevent the progrefs of deftruÂ£Hon by termi- nating the previous difeafe before mortification has taken place. It is a difeafe that may be prevented or arrefted in its progrefs; but having once taken place it does not admit of cure. But this fubjeff will be more fully explained when we come to examine the treatment of mortification; and for the purpofe of illuftrating in what inftanees the different kinds of ap- plications have their refpeftive preference, I fhall now proceed to date another infiance of external injury. The lafl fiatement was a cafe ofcontufion without injury of the integ- uments or frafiure of the bone; and that we may proceed in this inquiry by regular gradation, I fhall next mention what is called fimple frafture, with flight contufion, without injury to the integuments.

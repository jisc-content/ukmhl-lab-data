MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 285 The 4 A The other cafe above alluded to happened about the fame time ; it was the effedt of an accident at play, in confequence of a girl, about twelve years of age, being twilled in a rope that was ufed for a fwing. She fainted at the time, and in a few days the contents of the abdomen became inflamed. This difeafe terminated in fuppuration ; but when the abdomen became enlarged, as I bad more frequent opportunities of fee- ing this patient, and minutely watching the progrefs of the difeafe, and when the matter began to point at the umbilicus, I made an opening with a lancet, in confequence of which a large quantity of purulent matter was immediately difcharged. In this cafe every poffible attention was paid to the patient through the whole progrefs of the difeafe; the digitalis was given with much more care and circumTpedlion than in the former cafe, but not with the fame fuccefs ; the difcharge continued to increafe in quantity, and the patient funk under the difeafe in about two months from the time when the acci- dent firfl took place. I have mentioned thefe two cafes for the purpofe of illuflrating the effedls of digitalis, where matter forms in any of the internal cavities ; which was a fpecies of difeafe but imperfedlly undo hood previous to the date of Dr. Hunterâ€™s difcovery. It certainly would have been a great fatisfadlion, on this occalion, to have had it in my povrer to defcribe the {late of the parts of the unfuccefsful inflance after death ; as I think it is probable that the fuccefs in fuch cafes depends on an abfence of ulce- ration. In fuccefsful cafes the Hate of the parts cannot be known ; but if after death the parts are in general found ulcerated, it would furnifh very ftrong preemptive evidence in favour of this opinion.

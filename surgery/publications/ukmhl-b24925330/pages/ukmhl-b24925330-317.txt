MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 293 it 4 C deflroyed by the antipbiogiftic treatment, and fhould ultimately prove invincible, yet it will fink beneath the powers of the digitalis, and, for a time, not a fingle fymptom of difeafe remain. Of all the examples of the fufpenfion of morbid afiion, I know of none equal to this before us, where two contending powers will reciprocally take the lead in turn. Now it mull be evident that the digitalis is not an antiphlogiflic ; for if this medicine had the power of deflroying inflammation, when the difeafe had been fufpended for any length of time, it would either not return again, or elfe appear with diminifhed energy. But if the digitalis is not a diredl antidote for inflammation, it frequently becomes extremely in- flrumental in the removal of its confequences ; and under fome circum- fiances, which will be afterwards explained, it fometimes proves an effi- cacious method of practice to fufpend the difeafe by one power, whilft we deflroy it by another. In the phthifis pulmonalis, the phlogiflic diathefis mud be nearly con- quered before the digitalis can be made ufe of with advantage ; and it is for this reafon that this medicine has been found mod efficacious when given in the advanced ftages of the difeafe, at that period when the phlo- giflic diathefis has nearly exhaufted its own powers. The fir 11 indication in this formidable difeafe, according to Dofior Gregory *, is to deflroy the inflammatory diathefis ; but if the firft objedt cannot be accompliflied5 * In phthifis pulmonalis, the indications of cure which Doftor Gregory propofes are, to remove inflammatory diathefis ; to take off determination to the lungs, and to mitigate the feverity of par- ticular fymptoms.

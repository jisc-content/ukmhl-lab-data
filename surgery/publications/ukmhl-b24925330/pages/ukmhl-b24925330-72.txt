PHYSIOLOGY* 48 myftery has acquired a decided preference, the medical writers of the pre- fent age have been obliged to comply with the exigency of the times, un- der a certain expeftation that the lefs a book was underftood, the more it would be admired, and the more generally approved. The nature of the blood and the ftru&ure and mechanifm of the fangui- ferous fyftem, are on this occafion the principal fubje&s of Mr. I. Hunter’s anatomical and physiological inveftigations; but when we confider this partial examination of the animal fyftem, as the balls of the firft prin- ciples of a new method of treating furgical difeafes; the leaft inaccura- cy will break the conne&ioni and one fingle error invalidate the whole argument. Nature itfelf is perfeft, and though it never may be in our power to inveftigate the whole, yet every partial explanation will bear fimilar evi- dence of perfection, and the vacancies may be confidered as intermediate fpaces or links in the chain, which future ingenuity may afterwards ex- plain. If a perfeft knowledge of nature is not to be obtained, every fyftem of phyfiology muft be imperfeCt, but this is no reafon why it fliould be erro- neous. I lhall not attempt to follow Mr. I. Hunter through the whole, as a refutation of his opinion in a few inftances will be fufficient. If his theory of the animal ceconomy be erroneous, the practical inferences muft fall in confequence; he fays, “I have endeavoured to form this work in- to a regular fyftem, one part exa&ly depending upon another f I Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page a.

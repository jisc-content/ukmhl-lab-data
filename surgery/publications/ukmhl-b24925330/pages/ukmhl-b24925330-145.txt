THE EFFECTS OF BLEEDING* 121 phenomena of inflammation, though feated on the external parts, as much fo as any vifceral difeafe; whereas the inflammation that takes place, in confequence of injury to the external parts of the body, does not produce fizy blood, and as it differs in its nature, it confequently requires a differ- ent method of treatment. If then, the difeafe that takes place in confe- quence of external injury to the extremities, does not produce fizy blood; I fhall infer that bleeding will not prove equally efficacious in this fpecies of inflammation ; Ido not affert, that bleeding may notin fuch cafes be made ufe of with fafety, and in a plethoric ffate of the fyftem it may be produflive ofconfiderable advantage; but I wifh to be underftood, that it will not produce thofe falutary effects, as in other inftances of inflammatory difeafe. Cafes may occur where injuries of this kind are attended with a fizy {fate of the blood, but then it is to be underftood that this may be an acci- dental concurrence, and not a natural confequence of the injury. The blood might have been in a fizy ftate before the accident took place, as fubjefls in a ftate of previous inflammation are no more exempt from ac- cidents than thofe in perfefi health. Inflammation may take place, and proceed to mortification, and if bleeding be once or twice repeated during the rapid progrefs of this dif- eafe, I have always found that, if the blood is not fizy in the firft inftance, it will not become fo in the fecond or third; which is contrary to the phenomena that we have frequent opportunities of obferving in cafes of general inflammation of the fyftem. In the latter inftance, I know no limits to the ufe of the lancet fhort of a falutary termination of the difeafe; but in the former, bleeding does not appear to me a proper remedy, and fhould be ufed with the greateft H h caution;

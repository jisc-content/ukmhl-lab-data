MEDICINAL TREATMENT® 257 But S f s I was early led to believe that this was a difeafe To eafily to be cured, that I fuppofed the remedies were in every furgeon’s hands; and if I had never had the fatisfadlion of vifiting the metropolis, it is probable that I fnould have attributed the general want of fuccefs, and frequent inftances of mortality in fuch cafes, to the very humble, low, and much inferior ftate of country pradlice. But my mind is perledtly at eafe; and though I may fornetimes be fo unfortunate as to loofe a patient, yet I muft ac- knowledge that I do not experience the leafl remorfe of confcience for not having fent to London for advice. I fliall not attempt to give a tedious aefcription of the immature expe- rience of my youth; but when I went to the hofpitals, I certainly had formed fuch flattering expeditions as the fubfequent obfervations of Sir George Baker and Dodior Reynolds might at the prefent time induce the inexperienced to hope for. But I (hall not attempt to deferibe all that I faw in town, as I have no doubt but one example will give ample fatisfadlion to all parties. The cafe was a laceration of the ankle joint that nearly feparated the leg and foot afunder; the patient fell to the care of the fenior burgeon of Saint Thomas’s hofpital; the integument and capfular ligament were an- teriorly and laterally completely divided, and the flexor-tendons alfo torn in two; fo that the inflde of the joint was completely expofed. The firfl: view convinced the fenior furgeon of the unavoidable neceffity of imme- diate amputation, which he propofed to his patient with every expreflion of tender attention and humane concern that benevolence could dic- tate.

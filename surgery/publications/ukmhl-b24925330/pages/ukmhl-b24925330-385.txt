361 PART OF SURGERY. The 4 V Mr. I. Hunter is the lad and mod important writer on this fubjeH, and the deferved celebrity of his profedional reputation mud recommend his book to the attention of the public; for this reafon it is more parti- cularly necelfarv to point out fuch parts as are likely to midead the inex- perience of youth, as authority is the only dandard which the immatu- rity of reafon can appeal to. The dire&ions, which he has given refpeCling the extra£lion of balls and otherextrane >us fubdances, are direfHv contrary tothofeof Wifeman ; difapproves of earlv exira&ion, and aderts that “ opening on account of extraneous bodies at fird cannot be of fo much fervice as opening Tome time after He thinks it is better to undertake operations of this kind when the parts are in a date of inflammation, than to finidi the bu- dnefs of extraction before any difeafed aftion does take place. But if the attempt is not made early, it mud be obvious to every one9 who is practically acquainted with the fubjeCt, that the inflammation is the drd confequence of the exertions of nature to relieve herfelf from the incumbrances ; and if this bufinefsis done eafily by the adidance of fur- gery, the inflammation is in part prevented. But if the operation is de- layed, and inflammation takes place, the difhcuhy of extradion will be then increafed by the tumefaciion of the wound ; and the parts being at that time rendered acutely fenfible by difeafe, it would be extremely dan- gerous to dilate the wounded parts under fuch circumdances, and the con- fequences might prove fatal without any adequate probability of fuccefs. * I, Hunter on Gun-fhot Wounds, page 533.

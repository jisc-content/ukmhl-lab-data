112 MORTIFICATION IN In the treatment of the conflitution in cafes of gnn-fhot wounds, we meet with a fimilar want of diilinRion with refpeft to the remedies: he fays, “the bark and gentle bleeding when the pulfe begins to rife, are the bed treatment that I know of in inflammations, that arife either from ac- cidents or operations.” If on this occafion I fhould prefume to give my own opinion, I fhould affert with equal confidence that bark and bleeding are two remedies that are incompatible with each other.

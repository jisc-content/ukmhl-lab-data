387 FART OF SURGERY. The confequence of this inflammation is fo well defcribed by Mr. Sharp that I fhall copy his own words. He fays, “It muft be confefs’d however, that notwithflanding we derive fuch Benefits from the double Incifion, the contradlile Difpcfition of tire Mufcles, and perhaps of the Skin itfelf, is fo great, that in fpite of any Bandage they will retire from the Bone, efpeciaily in the Thigh, and fometimes render the Cure tedious. To remove this difficulty I have lately on fome Occafions made ufe of the Crofs-ftitch As a remedy for thefe difficulties he recommends the crofs-ftitch as an operation already known, but I wonder that a fur- geon of fuch experience fiiould not have been well convinced of the in- efficacy and danger of the practice. He enumerates the inconveniences, and though his obfervations in general ftrongly militate agarnft this me- thod of praflice, his opinion is ultimately given in its favour, and it is evident that his arguments were in direft oppofition to his own convidtion. But on what grounds Mr. Bell could affert that Mr. Sharp at lafl gave up the crofs-ftitch, I am at a lofs to determine. I remember this method was made ufe by fome of the furgeons when I attended the hofpitals, but not by all; in confequence of which it foon became a queftion of confideration with me which method ought to be preferred. In the firft placed confidered that it gave additional pain to the patient, and prolonged the operation ; and it frequently occafioned con- fiderable trouble to the operator, and the appearances of the flump, when it was drawn together at four parts, gave me a very unfavourable opinion of the praftice. If the inflammation is moderate, the gentle preffure of a linen roller carefully applied will be fufficient to keep the parts in a Sharp’s Critical Enquiry, page 266. proper

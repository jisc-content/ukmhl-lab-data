95 PHYSIOLOGY# than the arteries, it is impoflible that all the veins fhould be accompanied with correfponding arteries; and for the fame reafon, the arteries and veins cannot all unite by immediate anaftomofes. Mr. I. Hunter copies an obfervation from Dr. Hales, in which we are told, that the Dottor had feen a number of arteries throw their blood into one vein. In my opinion this is a fubjeft that is invifible, and beyond the reach of microfcopic inveftigation; but if true, it would prove that the blood efcapes from the arteries before it is received into the veins; and confequently whether the arteries are more numerous than the veins, or the veins more numerous than the arteries, the blood mud be taken up by the veins by abforption. By the power of abfprption the blood is not only firft taken up by the veins, but it is alfo by the fame power that the motion of the blood is continued through the whole venous fyftem. In the arterial fyftem, the blood moves from the centre to the circumfe- rence; in this inftance, it moves from the circumference to the centre. But when we have accompanied the progrefs of the blood into the venous fyftem, it then ceafes to be an objeft of attention by what power the olood was brought to this fituation; whether it was by the power of the heart continued beyond the extremities of the arterial fyftem, or whether it de- pended on a power of abforption that took place at the commencement of the veins. For the blood, once having entered the venous fyftem, it merous alfo in the neck of the human fubjeft ; but in fome of the vifccra, as the inteftines, the veins and arteries correfpond in number very exaftly.‚Äù I.

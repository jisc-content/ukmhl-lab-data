So that we find that, fim- ple as thefe remedies may appear at firift view, we have fome criterion by which to direft our choice. I have frequently feen inftances where accidents, that were originally infignificant in themfelves, have by fuch little errors in the method of treatment become important, and have rometimes had a long attendance to cure a difeafe which was the confequence of improper remedies. But I have feen cafes where the fkin was not affefted and where ftitnu- lating applications were inefficacious.

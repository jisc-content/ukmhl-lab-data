31 INTO TWO SPECIES. peruvian bark. I am very well fatisfied that bark and anodynes may be united under certain circumftances with great advantage, but I am alfo of opinion that, generally fpeaking, pain and irritation will terminate with the inflammatory fymptoms, and confequently that in this early period bark cannot be given with fafety, or can ever prove inftrumental in aba- ting the pain or correfting that fpecies of irritation which is the immediate confequence of inflammation; and if the inflammation is in a great degree, I think it is very doubtful whether anodynes can be given with a rational profpeff offuccefs; but after the inflammation has fubfided, anodynes may then be made ufe of with fafety and advantage, either as cordials, to abate the irritation of debility, or to procure repofe. But if the inflammation that takes place in confequence of external in- jury to the extremities, does not produce a phlogiftic diathefis, which is a queflion that will be afterwards determined, then, bleeding fhould be uf- ed with caution, and opium, for the fame reafon, may be given with lefs danger of increafing the morbid affion and with greater probability of producing the defired effeft. But the lancet and opium which fhould always be confidered as two diftinft and oppofite indications, are in the prefent inftance united in full force; he fays, “that pain is to be appeafed and reft obtained by anodynes, and inflammation is to be removed by free and frequent bleedings and after defcribing in general terms a plan of antiphlogiftic treatment, he then obferves, if our attempts do not fucceed, the confequence is gangrene and mortification; but the bark is not men- tioned as a remedy on this occafion. When fuppuration has taken place, the bark is recommended both in his remarks on fraftures, and in his re- * Pott’s general remarks on fractures and diflocations, fecond edition, page gi. marks

AMPUTATION. k If the art offurgery po fie fifes any other remedy for this formidable dif- eafe, it fhould have been pointed out; what method of treatment would have been proper on the commencement of the difeafe, fhould fir ft have been explained, and if it was poffible to flop its progrefs in more advan- ced flages, and what internal medicines, or external applications would contribute to promote the falutary purpofe, fhould have been particularly mentioned. We are not even informed how far the knife may be looked upon as an efficacious remedy, or whether amputation will, under any circumflances. Hop the progrefs of the difeafe; but, haflily puffing over thefe very impor- tant flages, without ever noticing any one critical period when either me- dicine or operation may be interpofed with advantage, we are at once informed, that, when a limb is deftroyed by mortification, “amputation is indifpenfible*.” But under fuch circumflances amputation is not a rem- edy for mortification, it can only be made ufe of for the removal of a dead part, which is become an offenfive incumbrance to the living body, and -which nature would herfelf accomplifh; in this inflance the furgeon may remove a dead limb as foon as he pleafes, but if it is thought neceffary for the patient’s future comfort to make a convenient flump, and for that purpofe to operate on the living part, it will flill be neceffary to obferve the fame rule, and not to operate until all difeafed aflion has fubfided. So that in this inflance amputation is not a remedy againfl mortification, but a remedy for the deformity that the mortification has occafioned. * Bell's fyftem of furgery, vol, 6, page 312, fifth edition.

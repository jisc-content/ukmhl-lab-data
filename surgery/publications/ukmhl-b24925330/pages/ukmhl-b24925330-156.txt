INFLAMMATION AND 13£ the gout is an inflammatory difeafe, and if diffufible flimuli poflefs the power of increafing the a6lion of the fyllem, it is not probable that fuch remedies fhould prove falutary medicines in gouty cafes. And as it is by many fuppofed that the gout is the offspring of intemperance, and that the fame caufe from which it nrft originated will not only ferve to pro- long its exigence, but will alfo increafe its powers, if thefe opinions are well founded it will be irrational to fu-ppofe that diffufible flimuli can be made ufe of with fuccefs for the purpofe of its deftruflion ; and it would be as difficult to account for the cure of the gout by the ufe of wine, and fpirits ; as to explain its propagation by a dofe of glauber faltsf. But if intemperence is admitted to be produ6live of this difeafe, it is equally rational to fuppofe that other fpecies of inflammation may depend on fimilar caufes. In the prefent inflance it is mofl probable that the gout was not a foli- tary difeafe ; for as Do6lor Brown had long experienced the effe6ls of dif- i fufible flimuli, and ultimately died a martyr to the caufe: inflammation of different kinds might have repeatedly taken place, and the vifcera alfo ftrong liquors as wine, and fpirits, 01 fpirits diluted with water, as warm as can be borne have in a few hours removed the mod violent fit, and reflored the ufe of the affefted foot. The fame reme- dies are of equal efficacy in removing the general fymptoms.” Brown’s elements of medicine, by Beddoes, vol, j, page 216. + “ It mull be obferved, that, as every direftly debilitating power is an exciting hurtful means of bringing on any afthenic difeafe, fo the effeft of every evacuation and particularly that by the belly, is well known to be a certain means of bringing on a fit of the gout. Among many other means of inducing that difeafe a fingle dofe of Glauber’s fait, though that be but a mild cathartic, will bring a fit of the gout on me at anytime,’’ Brown’s elements of medicine, voL I, page 217. have

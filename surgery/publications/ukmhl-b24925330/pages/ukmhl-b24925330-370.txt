s 246 THE OPERATIVE not prefume to boafl of having reached the fumrnit of perfe&ion, it would be uncandid to rejecl one opinion that appeared rational, becaufe we did not meet with a uniformity throughout the whole. In every appeal to high authority the genera! chara£fcr of the author is certainly a very intered’mg part of the fubjeft; but in the prefent in- fiance it is the date of forgery at that period which I widi to bring forwards, and not to prove that burgeons were then infallible. It is not the name that will fandlion an opinion, or the elevated fituation that will give cele- brity to the doctrines which I fhall have occafion to refer to; butas the evi- dence of nature is immutable, the coincidence mull prove their intrinfie merit. For the. purpofe of giving an impartial view of this fubjeft at that time, I fhall endeavour to trace the method of treatment recommended by Wifeman through the whole procefs, from the commencement ofthe accident to the termination ofthe difeafe. The fimilarity ofWifeman’s defcription of a gun-(hot wound to that of Mr. I. Hunter’s is particularly driking; it is probable that the theoreti- cal view’s of the latter might be the mod refined, but it is very evident that they both were defcribing the fame appearances. Wifeman fays, es Where the Bullet pierceth, it extinguifheth the natu- ral heat, and the Lips of the Wound are livid or blackifh; and if they be not dred rationally, they inflame, and are accompanied with Tumour, and Blifters frequently rife about them, alfo the matter is of a fetidfmelf. In this condition the Wound is commonly the fird day, and fo to the fe- venth ; and, if not fuccoured, it gangrenes, and fo the Patient commonly dies*.” * Wifeman’s Surgery, page 397. Mr.

When I attended the hofpitals the leather retra&or was ufed by fome furgeons, but not by all ; and if the advantages of this infirument were unqueflionable, it certainly would have been fan&ioned by univerfal approbation. In my opinion it is neither ufeful nor neceffary, and only ferves to embarrafs the furgeon and prolong the operation. A leather retra&or is certainly a greater in- cumbrance than a'piece of linen, and I have known the operator faw through both bone and retraftor at the fame time.

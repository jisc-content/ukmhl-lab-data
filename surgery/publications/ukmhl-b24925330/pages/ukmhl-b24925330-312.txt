MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 288 which I have met with, and I have had repeated opportunities fince that time of noticing fimilar evidence of the effefts of the digitalis. âœ“ The manner in which the digitalis gives relief in drop heal cafes, is fuppofed to be by promoting the abforption of the ferous effufion ; and the vox populi in common ufe on this occafion feems to fan&ion this opinion. But if we examine the fubjeft with critical attention, we (hall perhaps hefitate before we prefume to determine whether the effefts of the digitalis depend upon the increafed aclion of the abforbent fyfiem, or a diminution of fecretion. I fhould be forry to infult the anatomical reader with a repetition of thofe arguments which have fo frequently been made ufe of for the purpofe of explaining the accumulation of ferous effufion in the different cavities ; but it mud be obvious to thofe, who are acquainted with the operations of the animal occonomy, that the defici- ency or excefs of the fecreted fluids will depend on the proportions that exift between the fecreting and abforbent aftions. The effeffis of the d igitalis on the animal powers are to induce debility. It fufpends the aftion of the digcflive organs, diminifhes the powers of the circulation, and reduces the velocity of the pulfe ; it relaxes the energy of the nervous fyfiem, and if given to excefs will put a final flop to all the powers of the animal machine. If then the digitalis diminifhes the animal powers in every infiance in which we have an opportunity of obferving its mode of adlion, it will certainly be reafonable to con- elude, that, when the morbid accumulation is abated by the remedy, it mult be by diminifliing the a6lion of the organs of fecretion, and not by ftimulating

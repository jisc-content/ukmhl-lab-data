96 PHYSIOLOGY. then mud proceed on hydraulic principles, as there is no additional power, between the origin of the veins and their termination in the right auricle of the heart, that can in the lead contribute to a general increafe of the momentum of the blood through the venous fydem. The lateral preffure of the circumjacent parts will produce a partial ef- fect, but this is only temporary; and the lofs of the motion afterwards will be in proportion to the temporary increafe, as the blood cannot move for- ward with a velocity fuperior to the ratio with which it is received. It is impodible that more blood fhould be conveyed to the heart by the two cava than is received by the extremities of the branches. Weknow that, in confequence of mufcular exertion, the heart and lungs become incumbered with the accelerated motion of the venous blood; but this is only temporary, and the heart afterwards experiences a want of the cudomary fupply. This irregularity may take place in a degree fufficient to produce a fufpenfion of the motion of the heart, which may arife from two caufes; in the fird indance, from the accumulated blood, in thefecond, for want of neceffary fupply. For if the veins are in one indance emptied by the aftion of the circumjacent mufcles, they will be- come relaxed when that preffure is removed, and mud have time to fill before the regularity of the motion of the blood can be redored. By way of illudrating the effe&s of this lateral preffure, let us fuppofe that a deep feated vein in one of the extremities is fo compreffed as to propel the contents beyond the next pair of valves; as foon as this tern- porary preffure is removed, this vein will become relaxed, and ceafe to tranfmit

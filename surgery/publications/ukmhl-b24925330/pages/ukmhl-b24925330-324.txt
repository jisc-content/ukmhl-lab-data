MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 3°° In the latter flages of this difeafe he£lic fever takes place, and ultimate- ly the lungs become affe6led; but the difeafe frequently terminates with a formation of matter in the cavity of the abdomen, which fometimes makes it way through the depending parts, either by the fide of the rec- tum inform of fiftuia, or elfe through the anterior parts, which ever is moftfubje6l to its preflure. In this difeafe the phlogiftic diathefis does not take place in the early flages, and confequemly I think that the digitalis may at fuch periods be given with greater probability of fucceft. I never met with an in- flance of this difeafe that terminated favourably after the matter had made its way externally : but in the early ftages, whilft there is a pro- bability ot fuccefs, I think the indications are plain and rationally dedu- cible from the defeription I have already given of the nature of the dif- eafe. As it is not productive of inflammatory diathefis in the early fla- ges, bleeding will feldom be neceflary at this period; and for the fame reafons the digitalis will be more admiflible. The objeft appears to me to be, in the firft infiance to correCl the con- geftion or approaching tumifaClion of the glands of the vifcera ; cooling purges are well calculated for this purpofe, and when the morbid aCtion, which is probably of the inflammatory kind, has been by fuch means firft correfted, the digitalis appears to be ftrongly indicated ; and I fhould think that a judicious ufe of the digitalis, and cooling purges in the early flages of the difeafe, is a method that would in many inftances prove efficacious.

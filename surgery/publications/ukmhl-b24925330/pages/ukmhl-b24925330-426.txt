402 PART OF SURGERY, fear, diflrefs, etc. ? Thefe cirumfiances m'uft add greatly to the con- fequent mifchief, and call the balance much in favour of forbear- ance.^” In all cafes of violent injury of the extremities to fuch a degree as in- evitably renders amputation a neceffary remedy, the pain of body and apprehenfion of mind place the whole fyflem in a hate of aflive exertion ; and whatever may be the fituation of parties, I think it is reafonable to conclude that the hate of the mind will bear fome propor- tion to the nature of the injury, the degree of danger, and excefs of pain. And as the field of battle is a fituation that calls for great exertions, it is probable that intrepid fortitude will here be raifed to the hjgheft pitch; it woud be a reflection on the foldier’s character, a (lain on martial heroifm, at fuch a time to fall a have to fear. If then it is reafonable to conclude that in the field of battle the exertions muff; bear fome proportion to the danger, by immediate amputation the body is relieved from pain and the mind from fear : The quef- tion is at once decided, and the complicated danger reduced to a Ample cafe in furgery. By early amputation there is only one in- flammation, by delay there is the inflammation in confequence of the injury, and after a tedious interval of difeafe wre have flil! to meet the dangerous confequences of the operation. 1 he body buffers under pain, the mind becomes fubiued by a continued (fate of danger, and the patient finks under delay, protra&ed pain, long confinement, and weeks of apprehenfion.

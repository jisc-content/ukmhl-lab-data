MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 316 though he candidly acknowledges that he did not recolle£l the name of the author; and this omiffion may readily be accounted for, as it is evident that the fcience of medicine was not the leading objedl of his literary purfuits. I do not mean to infinuate that his defcriptions of dif- eafes are lefs accurate than fome that have been already noticed, which had the advantage of a profeffional pen ; or that thefe examples of cafe- writing are lefs deferving of our attention. They are all reprefeoted as indances of extreme danger, and the refpedlive recoveries as miraculous cures ; but if the defcriptions had not been fo fupeidatively chara61erized, they all would have been lefs liable to fufpicion. In the firfh cafe of putrid fever defcribed by Mr. Cartwright, bark and wine were given with other medicines, the particulars of which are not explained ; but the difeafe grew every day more untradtable and malig- nant ; two fpoonfuls of yeafl were then given, but whether it was re- peated once, twice, or three times, or how long it was continued, is not mentioned. We are only told it was given once, with diredlions to be repeated every three hours, if the firfl dofe fucceeded ; but we are not informed whether the firfl dofe was fuccefsful, or how far thefe dirt £iions were complied with. In a few days the boy is laid to have recovered, and, after that fhort interval, to look 1'urprizingly well ; and he acknow- ledged that he felt better from the infiant he took the yeafl. Let it be on this occafion remembered, that this was the period at which he was fuppofed to be in a dying fiate ; and I will venture to aflert that, under fuch circumfiar ces, it is not probable, let the powers of medicine be ever fo great, he Ihould have been fo immediately fenfible of their efftdls.

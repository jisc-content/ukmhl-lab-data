THE OPERATIVE 364 when he with great propriety adds, that by immediate amputation you have only inOammation in confequence of the operation ; but in the next line he changes his mind, and obferves that this is a bad recourfe ; and in the next page he expreftes himfelf in the ftrongeft terms, where he fays, that it admits of difpute whether at anytime and in any place amputation fhould be performed before the fir ft inflammation is over.1’ But. if the degree of injury is fucb, that the firft inflammation is likely to terminate in mortification and that in death, I ftioifld think that there cannot remain a doubt refpe&ing the propriety of immediate amputation : but, in fupport of a contrary opinion., our learned author immediately adds, that “ if the patient is not able to fupport the inflammation arifing from the accident, it is more than probable he would not be able to fup- port the amputation and its confequences.” But here it will be prudent to recollect that it is an unqueftionable mis- fortune which too frequently takes place, that gun-fhot wounds and other injuries produce a degree of inflammation which will inevitably ter- minate in mortification and death ; and as it alfo very fortunately hap- pens that we meet with inftances of recovery after amputation, there can be no queftion which, under fuch circumftances, ought to be preferred. Kis obje6l feems to be on all occafions to delay amputation as long as poftible, though at the fame time there is not the leaft doubt of its ulti- mate neceflity; from which it appears to have been his opinion that a ftate of danger was more defirable than a ftate of fafety, that two inflam- mations were better than one, and that a protra&ed difeafe was preferable to an expeditious cure.

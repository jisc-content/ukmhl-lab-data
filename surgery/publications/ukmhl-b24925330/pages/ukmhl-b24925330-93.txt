PHYSIOLOGY, ^9 The T fufpenflon of the vital powers, which circumflance proves, that the a£lion of the arteries is mufcular: for if their contraflion depended upon elaf- ticity, they would when empty continue in a contra£led date. Their diflention does not depend on a relaxation of their mufcles, but is affefted by the operation of a fuperior power; the heart and arteries ailing in oppofuion to each other, whilll the blood ferves as a refilling medium. Mr. I. Hunter attempts to explain the difference between muf- cular motion and elafticity, and endeavours to point out the different parts of an artery fubfervient to each; but the aflion of the arteries will be bed demonflrated by their natural operation and effe£ls, and the me- chanifm of the vafcular fyflem mod clearly illuflrated by the phenomena of life. Mr. I. Hunter has made choice of a different method, he has endea- voured a priori to explain the nature of mufcular motion, and to inves- tigate the flrufture and power of the arteries by diffeflion and experi- ment ; but the inferences are not applicable, as there is no other inflance of mufcular aflion fmilar to that of the arteries. It is not probable that any experiment, which can be made on an arte- ry after death, can in any refpefl explain the power of its aftion during life; on this occafion the arteries have been removed from their natural ftuation, and cut in pieces for the purpofe of afcertaining their powers by- trying what weight a flip of an artery would fupport, and what power would ’ear them afunder; it is only neceffary to mentionthefe experiments, they do not require an anfwer.

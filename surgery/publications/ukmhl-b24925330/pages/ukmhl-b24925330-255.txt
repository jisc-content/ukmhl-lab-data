231 CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. of an inferior degree to what was at firft made ufe of. But as the cafe copied from Mr. Douglas contains a full defeription of this method of pra&ice, and comes rather nearer to the prefent time, I {hall refer the rea- der back to the lad feftion. If fome mild digedive ointment fpread upon lint is made choice of as the firfl application to the ulcerated parts, it may be proper to warm the plaider to a degree rather above blood heat, by which it will be rendered foft and readily run into the interfaces of the parts, and by that means come in contact with every part of the ulcer; and, whatever may be the extent of the wound, this will make a proper application. But on this occafion it will never be necedary to make fcarifications; to cut the dead parts can be of no ufe; and, if the living parts are injured, the operation mud prove highly prejudicial. If it is necedary to intro• duce warm applications into the interdices of the parts, it is not necedary to make divifions for the fake of filling them. One great objedl on this occafion is to exclude the air, and as you cannot wipe it out, or pump it out, the only method is to put fome more folid and more friendly fub- dance in its place; but, if incifions are made only in the dead parts, they will be immediately filled with air. • V,' ' \ We have heard of heroes in the heat of action making bulwarks of the dead ; but to cut through the mortified parts in this indance is like remo- ving the impediments for the enemy’s introdudlion. The dead parts will be removed by the powers of nature, and the art of furgery does not pof- fefs the means of anticipating the progrefs. When

78 PHYSIOLOGY. the pinion, that if he had viewed the fubjeft in the light above defcribed, he would have found that the right fide of the heart would appear large, in confequence of being full of blood; and the left fide flabby, becaufe it was completely empty. Whoever will attentively examine Mr, I. Hunter’s obfervations on the aflion of the heart and arteries, will certainly find that he has incumbered the fubjeft with many difficulties; but has ultimately left the whole un- determined. I fhall not attempt to reply to every little obfervation that we meet with in this long difcuflion; but the defcription, that he has given of the mechanifm of the femilunar valves, will enable us to determine in what degree his anatomical opinions merit our attention. The femilunar valves are placed at the entrance of the aorta, for the purpofe of admitting the blo< d from the heart, and preventing its return. The funflion of thefe valves is certainly one of the moll plain and fimple operations in the whole animal machine; they do not poflefs any power of action in them- felves, but obey the preflure of the approaching and receding fluid, and operate only on mechanic principles; and yet this Ample piece of me* chanifm has long bewildered anatomifts of the firft-rate abilities. Dr. Mihles* fuppofed that thefe valves regulated the power of the heart * “ For, as the arterial valves at the heart, will admit of various apertures, the heart a£ts upon that hydraulic principle, whereby any force or prejfure, ever Jo weak, by urging a. fl .id throw,h an aperture, proportionably fmail,Jhall overcome any refijtance} or raifc any weight} ever Jo great.

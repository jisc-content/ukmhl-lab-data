THE EFFECTS OF BLEEDING. *33 L I then have been confiderably afte&ed, and, at the critical period above-mention- ed, a phlogiftic diathefis might have taken poffeflion of the whole fyftem; by which the gout was overpowered and its adtion confequently fufpend- ed. But when the phlogiftic diathefis was reduced by a dofe of glauber falts, the gout then becoming the fuperior difeafe would difplay its pow- ers. Under thefe circumftances the liberal ufe of ftrong liquors would increafe the phlogiftic diathefis, and the gout, being an inferior difeafe, would confequently fink into obfcurity. Inftances of this kind very frequently occur, where the gout and a phlo- giftic diathefis meet in oppofition to each other; and in general the fymp- toms of inflammation are erroneoufly attributed to a gouty origin. If the lungs are flightly inflamed, the difeafe is faid to be a gouty cough, and though fuch cafes are frequently attended with a plethoric ftate of the fyftem, yet bleeding and purging are thought to be equally improper. In inferior inftances of difeafe, wherefometimes the cough and fometimes the gout will alternately prevail, the general prejudice againft bleeding and purging is fo great, that it rarely happens that any regular plan of treatment is complied with; and if the pulmonic affeddion and phlogiftic diathefis fpontaneoufly fubfide, the gout is then fet at liberty, and a re- gular fit of the gout in the extremities is the immediate confequence. But if the inflammation goes on increafing, a true peripneumony frequently takes place, and the a&ion of the gout becomes fufpended by the general influence of a fuperior difeafe. When the fymptoms are become fo truly formidable, I fuppofe that

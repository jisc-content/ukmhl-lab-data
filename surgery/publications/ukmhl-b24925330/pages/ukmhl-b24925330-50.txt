THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION 22 might be the public opinion on this fubje£l, but it is exprefsly giving the opinion as his own; for to acknowledge the juflice of an opinion is cer- tainly to declare conviflion of its truth. The mortification of the toes and feet, is in the firft inftance mentioned as a fpecies of the difiempers called gangrene and mortification; if there- fore the bark was known to be an efficacious remedy in one inftance, it might alfo be expefled to prove equally fo in the other, for fo long as the difeafes were fuppofed to be fimilar, the fame remedy might with propri- ety be confidered applicable to both: but in the next page we are inform- ed, that this difeafe is very unlike to every other kind of mortification, both in its attack and in its procefs, the difeafes therefore being different, we may ceafe to wonder if each requires a different remedy. Why then fhould our learned author fuppofe, “that many of his read- ers will be furprifed at his affirming, that the bark will not flop the progrefs of this fpecies of mortification; becaufe there is another, in which it has been regarded as a fpecific?” He has given fufficient evidence of its in- efficacy in one inftance, but neither faff nor argument in fupport of its fa- lutary influence in the other; fo long as they were both confidered as the fame difeafe the praftical evidence muft have been general, and every un- fuccefsful inftance muft have then appeared in oppofition to any favour- able opinion of the bark, as a remedy in gangrene and mortification.

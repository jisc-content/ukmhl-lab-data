226 CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. grefs of the difeafe when it does occur, I {hall not make that operation an objefl of our prefent confideration. In cafes of compound fradture, if the wound in the integuments is fmall, it will not in general be neceffary to remove the dreffings fora confider- able time, perhaps for a fortnight orthree weeks; and the whole treatment by this means will be rendered f milar to that of a fimple fradlure. But let the wound be more or lefs extenfi ve, it certainly cannot be neceffary to remove the dreffings previous to the commencement of digeflion, when we (hall have paffied by the firft danger of mortification with fafety. So that we evidently avoid every objedlion to this method ofpra&ice during the firft period of the difeafe. Even if fomentations are thought necef- fary, they may be applied without removing the bandages, and we cannot have any motive for opening the wound before digeflion has taken place. Whether the wound be large or fmall, we will fuppofe it to be protec- ted with proper dreffings, and the whole of the injured parts furrounded with flannel in the form of the eighteen tailed bandage. Let us here con- fider what additional affiflance can be given during this critical momen- tous interval, before the commencement of digeflion. The judicious application of warm fomentations feems to be the only external remedy that can be made ufe of with any rational probability of advantage; it ap- pears to be the lafl refource we have to depend upon, the ne plus ultra of our hopes. The next queflion will be what kind of fomentation will claim the pre- ference, and in what manner it may be applied with the greatefl probabil- * ity

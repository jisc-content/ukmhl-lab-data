252 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. But oppofite nature that might prove equally prejudicial. I do not think this is a queftion that admits of compromife in principle; but as it is impof- fible to regulate our pra&ice with fcientific certainty, I only wifh to in- troduce this obfervation for the purpofe of guarding as much as poffible againfl an imperfection that is, in fome degree, unavoidable. I do not fuppofe that any one will contend that the fever immediately changes from the higheft degree of morbid aCtion to the loweft degree of putrid debility. But I think it is evident that the declenfion is by degrees, and that there is a regular decreafe of aftion from the acme of fever to the commencement of putrid diathefis. But whatever may be the rapi- dity of the declenfion, no truth can be more evident than that the change muft take place before it can become perceptible. Now as it is in my opi- nion, an objeCt of great importance that the energy of the conflitution fhould be fupported at this critical period, and as in praftice it will be irn- poffible exaCfly to mark the change; I fhould by the bed fide advife that the bark fhould rather be given a few hours too foon than one too late. It may be here recolleded that I have before obferved, that the fever, which is the confequence of external injury to the extremities, is not a phlogiflic difeafe; and this is a circumftance which in the prefent inffance particularly merits our attention; for though I think the bark fhould be given with great caution in all cafes of fever, yet I am of opinion there is no inflance which forbids the ufe of the bark fo powerfully as a true inflammatory difeafe. And if that which is the fubjeft of our prefent con- fideration had been of this kind, it would have been neceffary that a per- feff folution of the difeafe fhould have taken place before it was proper that the bark fhould be adminifteied.

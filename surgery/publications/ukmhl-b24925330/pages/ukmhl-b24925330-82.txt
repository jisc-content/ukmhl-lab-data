58 PHYSIOLOGY. \ and endeavouring to prove,, that one part of the blood is more important than another. That I may avoid all fufpicion of mifreprefentation I Hi all beg leave to copy the original defcription: our author obferves, “that moll probably the effedfs of the air upon the blood are greateft on the coagulable lymph, and this conjeCiure is rendered more likely when we confider that in ani- mals which have no red globules of any kind refpiration is as elfential to their exigence as any other*.” This is a curious argument, but I think the fophiftry will be ealily expo- fed ; the firft obfervation informs us that molt probably the effects are fuch, and confequently the argument commences with-doubt and is incumbered with apprehenlion: whereas a philofopher, who is convinced of the truth of what he is about to alfert, will not exprefs himfelf in doubtful terms, but every word will imply conviftion. In the prefent inltance for the purpofe of fupporting a conjecture, For it is only termed a conjeCture, though it is evident that this conjeCture is reprefented as an important truth, he then obferves that “this conjec- ture is rendered more likely, when we confider that in animals which have no red globules of any kind, refpiration is as elfential to their exiltence, as in any other.” But this affertion is incorreCt; I do not deny the neceffi- ty of refpiration to a great variety of animals that have not red blood, but if we trace the fubjeCl through the whole chain of natural hillofy, we lhall find the evidence againlt the point in quellion. * I.

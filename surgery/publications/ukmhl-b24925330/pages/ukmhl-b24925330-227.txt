CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT# *03 cept the cauftic applications, they may beconfidered much more infigni- ficant than powerful; and yet an accurate difcrimination will, on many occafions, be attended with evident advantages.

For the purpofe of illuftrating the powers and properties of chirurgi- cal applications, I fhall hate a few inflances that may be fuppofed to re- quire a variety in the method of treatment. If we were to divide the fub- je6l into different parts, and afterwards feparately examine the merits of each particular queftion, the firft would be, whether in cafes of contufi- ons, fractures, wounds, &c. 8cc. it would be more advifable to make ufe of chirurgical applications, or whether it would be better to leave the whole to nature.

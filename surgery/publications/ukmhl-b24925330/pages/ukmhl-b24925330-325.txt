MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 30* ifiia 4 E In the advanced ftages both of inflammatory rheumatifm and eryflpe- 'las I have known the digitalis prove a powerful remedy; but in the early fiages, before the inflammatory fymptoms have been abated, it is a ufelefs medicine. I have lately met with a curious inftance of protrac- ted eryfipelas, in which the powers of the digitalis were particularly con- fpicuous. The difeafe had exifted for more than a month when the patient came ynder my care, and a variety of remedies were made ufe of without any good effedL Previous to this illnefs he was a ftrong young man about twenty years of age and in perfedf health. When I firft faw him, the ery- fipelas was general, and he was fwelled from head to foot to a degree that I never before was witnefs to ; and fo great was the inflammation over the whole furface that the cuticle was feparated, and there was a general difcharge from all parts of the body, to fuch an excefs that his linen be- came wet through in a few minutes after its application, and in a nights time the fheets and blankets were moiflened through. He was every night and morning ftripped naked before the fire, and waffled all over with vegeto-mineral water, moderately warm; and before the applicaiion was made ufe of, the difcharge on his fkin might be feen to Hand in drops on all parts of his body. His pulfe was in general about an hundred and ten, and very full ; and as the difeafe appeared to me highly inflammatory, I began with a plan of antiphlogifilc treatment, but the fwelling was fo great in all parts of his body that it was rather doubtful whether it would be poflible to bleed him.

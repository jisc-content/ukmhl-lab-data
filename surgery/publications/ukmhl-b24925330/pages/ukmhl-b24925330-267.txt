MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 243 IF the patient is in a plethoric hate, once bleeding may be made ufeof with fafety, but I do not confider bleeding a proper remedy except in fuch aifeafes as produce a fizy flate of the blood; and I am of opinion that no degree of inflammation, that is produced by means of external injury on the extremities, ever becomes the caufe of that effed; fo that I (hall in the prefent inftance give it as my decided opinion, that repeated bleed- ing would be improper. In the books that I have confulted on this fub- jed, inftead of meeting with any intelligible opinion, we are more fre- quently embarraffed by a catalogue of remedies that are promifcuoufiy alfembled together without any principle to dired our choice. Whether the opinion I have already given is right or wrong, is not the queltion in the prefent inftance ; what I contend for is, that I have at lead: an imagi- nary bafis on which to reft my argument. If then bleeding is only an efficacious remedy in thofe difeafes that pro- duce fizy blood, and if the difeafe now in queftion does not produce fizy blood, my inference is well lounded; to oppofe my opinion you mud dif- prove the fads. I am not fo prefurnptuous as to think myfelf infallible; but, as fuch has been the refult of my enquiries, I (hall endeavour under one general principle to point out fuch a fyflem of pradice as appears to me molt rational on this occafion.

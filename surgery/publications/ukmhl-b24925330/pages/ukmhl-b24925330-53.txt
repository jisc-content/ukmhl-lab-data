INTO TWO SPECIES. The correcting of the badnefs of general habit is here mentioned as a buhnefs that may be eafily and expeditioufly accomplifhed, and indeed ex- pedition is highly neceffary, when a difeafe is making fuch rapid and de- finitive progrefs; but the fhort interval between the commencement of mortification and the death of the patient, does not afford a momentary opportunity for any other confideration; to flop the progrefs or deflroy the malignancy of a fpreading gangrene, is an objeCt of fufficient impor- tance to engage our whole attention. But this is not my only objection: for the method that is directed is as improper as the time. I do not pretend to affert that high inflammation, badnefs of general habit, or improper difpofition of the limb would not either feparately or jointly increafe the danger; but I wifh to confider the difeafe independent of fuch additional difficulties, and to regulate our plan of treatment, and form a prognofis of the event according to the degree and nature of the injury. With refpeCt to the pofition of the limb, it is creating a difficulty to fuppofe it improper. I am not contending againfl the errors of igno- rance, or the misfortunes of inattention, nor am I Bating a cafe, where an accomplifhed furgeon is called upon to corre61 the mifconduCt of empiri- cifm; fuch alfiflance may belong to what is called the “help of art,” but it is not the fpecies of remedy that I am now endeavouring to invefligate. I would rather fuppofe that all had been done in the early flages of the difeafe that the art of furgery could afford, that the patient, from the com- mencement of the injury, had been protected by the firfl profeffional abi- lities, and that Mr. Pott, or fome other perfon of equal eminence, had di- rected the whole proceeding.

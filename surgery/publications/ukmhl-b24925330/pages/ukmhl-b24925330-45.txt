INTO TWO SPECIES. If mortification is that ftate of difeafe when the vital powers have become extinft, it is a difeafe for which there is no remedy; for which reafon it is only in the early ftages, that the powers of medicine can be interpofed with much probability of fuccefs. The mortification of the toes and feet is a difeafe fo ftrongly marked, that all the defcriptions we meet with nearly correfpond, fo much fo, that mot the lead doubt can remain of the difeafe having been frequently no- ticed by a variety of authors; yet, at the fame time that they gave accu- rate defcriptions of what they faw, they did not fufpeft, that the cafes be- fore them differed from that mortification, which is the confequence of inflammation; but as they only referable each other in their termination, and as they differ in every other refpeft both in their nature, properties, and fubje&ion to the powers of medicine, we mult confider this a difeafe fui generis, agreeable to Mr. Pott’s opinion. I have already mentioned that this difeafe was defcribed by Wifeman, and if we compare what he has written with the obfervations of Mr. Sharp, and the ftill more accurate defcription of Mr. Pott, the fimilarity of ex- preflion mufl: convince us that the fubjeft was the fame; but that no doubt may remain on this part of the queftion, I fhall give the quotations in full; Wifeman fays, “but as people are fometimes fubjeft to gangrene by ma- king fontanels; fo others we hear of that have been gangrened from par- ing a corn or a nail on their toes* and Mr. Pott makes ufe of nearly the fame words; he fays, “if the patient has lately cut his nails or corns, it is moft frequently, though very unjuflly, fet to the account of fuch operationf”. * Wifeman’s furgery page 439. t Pott on the mortification of the toes and feet page 149* F Mr.

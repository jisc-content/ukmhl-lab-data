The ftate of the public opinion refpedling the ufe of warm and cold applications in fome inftances has been already difcufted, but what degree of heat is preferable on different occafions has not been yet determined. When the injury is limited to the extremities, a greater degree of heat may be admifiible, and applications may perhaps be made ufe of in fuch inftances more warm than would be necelfary or proper under other cir- cumftances, without being produdiive of any very important inconveni- encies. But when the feat of injury is in the external parts of the abdo- men or thorax, then more caution becomes neceffary; and it fometimes happens the vifcera are fo much affedled by external injury, that the dif- eafe may terminate in mortification. I know of no inftance where the effedls of the warm bath are fo confpi- cuous as ininflammations of the abdominal vifcera; andyet, notwithftand- ing its great efficacy, I think it is one of the laft remedies that fhould be made ufe of. If a patient, under fuch circumftances, is plunged into a hot bath inftead of a warm one in the early ftate of the difeafe, and without previous evacuations having been employed, inftead ofproducing a falu- taryeffedf, I fhould be appreherffive of the moft dangerous confequences. But if by copious bleeding and a liberal ufe of purgative medicines the leaf! abatement of the fymptoms is obtained, it frequently happens, at this critical period, that a judicious application of the warm bath will produce a complete folution of the difeafe.

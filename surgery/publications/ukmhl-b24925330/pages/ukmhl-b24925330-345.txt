321 MEDICINAL TREATMENT. When inflammation and fuppuration have taken place in the extre- mities, and the difcharge become putrid, abforption will fometimes take place in a fingle lymphatic, and will mark its progrefs by a red ftreak up the limb ; under fuch circumftances I have frequently had opportunities of trying the effe&s of the bark, and have found that the progrefs of the difeafe was immediately put a flop to, and the abforption, which was making its way up the lymphatics, immediately compelled to take a re- trogade courfe, and in twelve hours I have feen the difcharge from the ulcerated parts put on an healthy appearance. This certainly muff be confidered as ocular demonfiration of the falutary powers of the bark in cafes of mortification, and is a fpecies of evidence which everyone, who will be at the trouble to attend to the progrefs of fuch difeafes, mull have frequent opportunities of obferving. But if the bark does poffefs the power of preventing the progrefs of mortification under certain circum- itances, we are not to conclude that every kind and degree of this difeafe will admit of cure; and, on the contrary, if we are to difcredit the vir- tues of a medicine becaufe it does not in every inftance prove fuccefsful, the whole materia medica mull lofe its reputation. But in a number of inftances where the bark is fuppofed to be an effi- cacious remedy, it will frequently prove an arduous talk, to difiinguifh between the operations of medicine, and the powers of nature fet free from the influence of difeafe. When the difeafe completely terminates, and the recovery is perfeft, the falutary operations will regain their influence, and the powers of na- ture refume their former energy, independent of the flimulus of tonic 4 K medicines.

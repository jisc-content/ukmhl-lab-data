148 THE PRINCIPLES OP ures with a lancet this is a new fpecies of topical bleeding and deferveg our ferious attention. I fhould confider it a very dangerous experiment to punfture a part with a lancet already in a high ftate of inflammation; and at the fame time I cannot conjecture what would be the advantage; if we confider it as a method of evacuating the veflels of the part, it would not anfwer our expectations. If a fcarificator with fixteen lancets was made ufe of, the quantity of blood difcarged would be very infignificant if cupping glafles were not afterwards applied ; and I fhould think that the danger of increafing the inflammation would far exceed every rational profpeCt of advantage. In cafes where the inflammation is inconfiderable, it would certainly be imprudent to do more than neceflary ; and when the inflammation is very great a few punCtures with a lancet might occafion a floughing, and this endanger the Iofs of the limb, and perhaps deter- mine the fate of the patient. It appears to me a fpeculative opinion that has never yet been put in praCtice ; for if he had ever tried the experi- ment, he lhould have favoured the public with a few hiftories of its fuc- cefs. Topical bleeding is recommended in the gout; but this method of punc- turing with a lancet is not mentioned, and leeches have the preference on this occafion. When we are informed that bleeding with leeches in the gout immedi- ately eafes the pain, the fuccefs is a fufficient argument in favour of the practice; but notwithftanding this good effeCt, our candid author immedi- * I, Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 564. ately

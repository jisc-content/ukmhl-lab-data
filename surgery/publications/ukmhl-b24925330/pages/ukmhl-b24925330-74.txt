PHYSIOLOGY* 5° I fhall not have occafion to repeat the experiments for the purpofe of proving the fallacy of this hypothelis; the difcordance of opinion will fufficiently illuftrate the prefent ftate of this fubje£t, with the addition of all the fplendid decorations of modern improvements. At the fame time it will be proper to obferve, that it is not an objeft of much importance on the prefent occafion, whether the blood is compofed of red or white glo- bules; the queftion is, whether Mr. I. Hunter’s opinion bears the appear- ance of confiftency, and whether what he has written on the general prin- ciple of the blood, will in any refpefl illuftrate the fubfequent parts of the fubjeft? «# , If his obfervations are ill-founded, if his arguments are unconne&ed, his theory muft be fet afide as unworthy of attention, and we {hall then have to examine his method of treating inflammation, and mortification, on a pra&ical bafis independent of any theoretical fpeculation. We are told in the commencement of this difcuflion, that, “the blood is a material objeft in the theory of inflammationwhich induced me to expeft a regular conneHed train of arguments, explanatory of the oper- ations of the animal fyftem, both in a ftate of health and difeafe; and though the fyftem might in many inftances have proved imperfeft, yet the outlines would have difplayed fome ufeful information. But I have care- fully examined the whole, and am under the neceflity of acknowledging, that I can difcover neither connexion of argument, nor rational inference. In the analyfis of the blood we find this fluid divided into three com- ponent parts; the red globules, the ferum, and coagulating lymph. This latter

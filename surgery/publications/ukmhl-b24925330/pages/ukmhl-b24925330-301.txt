MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 2 77 If I had done wrong, I have no doubt but fome method would have been taken to have convinced me of the impropriety of my condufl. For fuch is the impartial refpe£l with which I have long been favoured, and fuch the public attention which I am proud to boad of, that I am well convinced not even my errors would have been permitted to have paffed unnoticed. The difeafe which takes place in cafes of drangulated hernia is of the mixed kind, and may in the firfl inflance depend on an inflammation of either the internal or external parts of the hernia; but in the latter in- flance, when it proceeds to mortification, it is in fome refpe£ls fimilarto that fpecies of difeafe in the extremities which is the effedl of bandage, which are both frequently completely cured by the removing of thecaufe. In the one cafe the taking off the bandage may prove an immediate cure, and in the other the difeafe is fometimes brought to a falutary termination by the operation for the bubonocele. But it mufl be evident, in fuch inflances of complicated difeafe, that the method of treatment mud be varied according to the refpe&ive com- bination of circumflances. And there are two important obje£ls that on this occafion particularly merit our attention; the firfl is, that purgative medicines will frequently not fucceed, and that accumulated dofes are fometimes produdlive of bad effects ; the fecond is, that mortification in cafes of hernia is not always fatal, as this is fometimes a partial difeafe and limited to the hernia and its contents; and it is in fuch cafes where the operation for the bubonocele would be mod likely to prove efficaci- ous, if undertaken at a proper period of the difeafe.

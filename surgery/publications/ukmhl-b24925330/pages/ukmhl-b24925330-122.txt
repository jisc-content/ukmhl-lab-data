98 PHYSIOLOGY. As the power with which the veins contrafl; is in proportion to their diftention, this will increafe in proportion to the plethoric ftate of thefyf. tem; at the fame time it is alfo probable that the aflion of the veins, as well as the arteries, increafes under the influence of difeafe. From which it will be evident that the immediate effefts of taking a quantity of blood from a vein in the arm, on the mechanifm of the circulation, will be to di- minflh the plethoric ftate of the venae cavae, and confequently diminifh the fupply to the right fide of the heart. I have now attempted to trace the progrefs of the blood through the arterial and venous fyftems; and have endeavoured to point out fome few operations of thofe veflels, that have previoufly pafled unnoticed. But I am notfo prefumptuous as to fuppofe, that thefubjefi is yet exhaufted; or that it is in my power to give a perfect explanation of the mechanifm of the circulation. It is a fubjeft that beggars all defcription, and will at laft be but imperfeÂ£lly underftood; we may trace the outlines, but the minutiae are not within our reach. When the utmoft anatomical ingenuity and addrefs have been employ- ed to inveftigate the form and ftru&ureofthe parts; when the various operations of the fanguiferous fyftem have been attentively obferved in a ftate of health, and under the influence of difeafe examined with accu- rate attention; when the various authors who have written on this fubjeft have been confulted, and their opinions compared with the evidence of nature; when every part has firft been feparately examined, and afterward aflembled in one clear point of general perfpetlive, fo that the whole may be comprehended in one view: then, but not till then, the enlightened phyfiolo-

PART OF SURGERY. 397 a certain proportion to each other. If on this occafion I fhould be ac- cufed of creating imaginary difficulties, or magnifying infignificant dan- gers that may by fome be corffidered unworthy of attention, 1 {hall beg leave to advife thofe, who are of a contrary opinion, to pay more critical attention to the evidence of their own pra£lice; as the advantages of ear- ly decifion, and the danger of operating after inflammation has taken place, are as evident in cafes of fradfures of the fkull, as they are in other inftances of compound fra£lure. I do not pretend to affert, that, if an ignorant furgeon had in the fir ft inftance not traced the injury to its full extent, but had left a depreffion of the fra&ured fkull (fill refting on the brain, if under fuch circum- fiances inflammation had taken place, any additional operation might not be performed with fafety and advantage. I only wiffi to obferve, that the difeafed ftate of the parts would increafe the danger; and if there had been any omiffion in the firft inftance, the neceffity of any additional operation fhould be rendered unqueftionable before it was undertaken. In many formidable cafes of injury to the head, the brain is generally fo much affefled that the patient is not capable of giving an account of his own fituation; and it frequently happens in cafes of concuffion of the brain, without the leaf! apparent injury either to the integument or fkull, that all the mental faculties will be fufpended for a length of time, and yet the patient ultimately do well. In cafes where the fkull is fra&ured it will be right to trace the injury to its full extent; But what I contend for is that, whatever operation may be thought neceftary, it fhould be per- formed before inflammation has taken place.

TOPICAL BLEEDING. 149 ately adds a caution, that it is not meant here to recommend bleeding in the gout. But if it is a ufeful remedy why not recommend it, or if he in- tended to recommend bleeding with leeches in the part, and to difapprove bleeding in the arm with the lancet in gouty cafes, why not exprefs him- felfin intelligible language, and diftinguifh between the two? Whatever may be his opinion of general bleeding, it is evident that he approves bleeding in the part affefled, and yet his own theoretical obfervations plead againft his practical advice, as he acknowledges that the pain in the gout does not depend on the diftention of the veffels, and if the ob- je6l of topical bleeding be to evacuate the veffels of the part, in fuch in« fiances we mull in confequence infer that it cannot be neceffary. In one place he obferves *that the effe&s of bleeding cannot be ex- plained on mechanical principles, yet admits the mechanical influence before he concludes the fentence. But for the purpofe of avoiding all thefe difficulties, a new hypothefis is then brought forward; the fulnefs of the veffels is no longer referred to as a part of the difeafe, nor the e- vacuation taken into the account as a falutary effefl of bleeding. And as this new theory is not regulated by the laws of the circulation, all argu-r ments, that might be founded on the anatomy of the vafcular fyftem, ceafe to demand attention. The powers of fympathy are then brought forward in full force, and * “ If confidered in a mechanical light, as fimply leffening the quantity of blood, it cannot account' for it; becaufe the removal of any natural mechanical power, can never remove a caufe which nei- ther took its rife from, nor is fupported by it: however, in this light it may be of fome fervicej becaufe, all the attions relative to the blood’s motion will be performed with more cafe to the folids when the quantity is well proportioned.” I.

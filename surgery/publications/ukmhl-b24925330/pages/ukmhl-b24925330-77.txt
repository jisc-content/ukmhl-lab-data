53 PHYSIOLOGY. yond the bounds of rational invefligation; it is alfo equally irrational to at- tempt to explain different fubjefls, that have no relation to each other, by limilar laws, or to fuppofe that one mode of demonilration is equally applicable to every branch of natural philofophy. The laws of gravitation were, about a century ago, made ufe of to ex- plain the phenomena of chymiflry; and the operations of chymiflry have in their turn been applied, with no lefs impropriety, to illuflrate the orga- nization of animal life. Even in Haller’s time, the method of analyfing the blood was by diftillation: but as diffillation is not an animal procefs, and as we do not meet with any fuch apparatus in the animal machine, this fpecies of invefligation would not improve our knowledge of this fubjefl. If we attentively examine Mr. I. Hunter’s obfervations on the ferumof the blood, we {hall find that he has been amufing himfelf and his readers with delufions equally unnatural; he heats the ferumof the blood to 165 degrees to make it coagulate, and the * gravies of both boiled and roafted meats are introduced as evidence on this occafion; but, as none of thefe circumflances are analogous to life, they are all inapplicable to the prefent fubjeft. The gravies of dreffed meat might furnifh converfation to a con- vivial profeffional party, but appear as an ufelefs intrufion in their pre- fent fituation. Some of his experiments are made in imitation of a chymical compo- * I. Hunter on gun-Hiot wounds, page 32. P fition

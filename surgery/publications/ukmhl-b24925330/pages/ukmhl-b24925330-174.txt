15° the principles of topical bleeding explained on the principles of contiguous fympathy* The Ikin of the abdomen is fuppofed to fympathize with the liver, ho- mach, and bowels, and the lungs with the integuments of the chefb He fays that, “in affefiions of the lungs bleeding oppofite to them is of fer- vice; but in fuch cafes it is not clear where the inflammation is ; for if in the pleura then it does not acl upon this principle but by continued fym- pathy In the firft place, I deny the faffs, and do not admit that bleeding near the part produces any effeft as a topical application. In cafes of perip- neumony, or pleurify, if topical bleeding was alone made ufe of, and the lancet laid afide, if one in a hundred efcaped with life, it might be looked upon as a miraculous recovery. Let it here be remembered that Syden- ham feldom cured a pleurify with lefs than the lofs of forty ounces of blood, and then confider whether this will be in general taken by the ap- plication of leeches to the fide. But as the laws of fympathy have never yet been accurately explained, it would have been a fatisfaflion to the reader if Mr. I.

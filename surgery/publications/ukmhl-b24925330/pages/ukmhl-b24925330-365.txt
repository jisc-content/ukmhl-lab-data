341 PART OF SURGERY. Here the bufinefs reded for upwards of twenty years, when the appear* ance of * M. Bilguer’s diflerlation on the inutility of amputation once more didurbed the tranquillity of the public mind ; and if we confider the prefent unfettled (late of the fubjeCf, it will be impoffible to conjecture at what future cribs we fhall meet repofe. It certainly mult be looked upon as an indelible reflection on the En* glifh character, that a work fo truly contemptible fhould have had fuch extenfive influence ; but the captivating attractions of novelty, and the fafcinating powers of great names, will always have their right with thofe who, not pofTeffing abilities to think for themfelves, depend alone on the authority of others. But it is probable, in this inftance, that the high reputation of the monarch, whom Bilguer at that time ferved, gave a ce- lebrity both to the author and his book, which neither intrinfically had the mod; humble claim to. But the appearance of this tranflation immediately attraCled the atten- tion of the public, and firff having impofed upon the credulous, it foon became a fubjeft of general controverfy; and though Mr. Pott’s argu- ments on this occafion are too plain to admit of mifieprefentation, and his decifion fo particularly fatisfaClory, dill we find, both in theory and praClice, that the quedion remains in an unfettled date. * See a differtation on the inutility of the amputation of limbs, written in latin by M. Bilguer Surgeon general to the armies of the King of Piuffia, augmented with the notes of Mr. Tiflot, phy- fician at Laufanne, now fi ft tranflated into Englifh by a furgeon. London, printed for R.

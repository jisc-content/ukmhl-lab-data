CHIRURGICAL TREATMENT. 211 If then we fhould at lad difcover that thofe applications are bed which are mod inactive, we (hall have forae motive to direft our conduft; and whim and caprice may ceafe to induence the practice of furgery. I well remember the time when fraffures had ufed to be treated with all the parade of rollers, fplints, fraflure boxes, and cradles; and I am rea- dy to give evidence, that I have witneffed a number of indances of per- feft and fpeedy recovery under this oppredive method of treatment. But I am fo well fatisded and convinced of the impropriety of this method of pra&ice, that if I was under the unavoidable necedity, either of making ufe of this load of apparatus, or of truding a fraflured limb folely to the proteflion of a foft pillow, I certainly fhould prefer the latter. If in many indances I am induced to depreciate fome of the imaginary powers of furgery, I do not intend at the fame time to diminidi the im- portance of the profedion. My objeft is to give a rational edimate of the different parts, and by a general reprefentation to illudrate the im- portance of the whole; and thus by plain and unadorned defcription to fet a myderious fubjefl in a clear and perfpicuous point of view. Perhaps by fome I fhall be accufed of expreding myfelf in too plain lan- guage, and cenfured for betraying the little fecrets of our art. But here let me tell thofe prefumptuous readers, who think that they can learn the praftice of phyfic and furgery from reading a fingle book, that the grand fecret cannot bedifclofed to any, but thofe who have been regularly ini- tiated, and previoudy acquainted with the myderies of the profedion.

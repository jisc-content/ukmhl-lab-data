He was the iecond in (landing, but looked upon himfelf as firfl in abiliiies. As the propriety of amputation in fuch cafes is certainly a ques- tion of critical importance, the fenior furgeon very candidly folicited his opinion ; but I am forry to recoiled that the anfwer was not returned with the fame degree of liberality with which it was folicited, or with that ci- vility which the age and virtues of the other party, both as a man and as a furgeon, had an undoubted claim to.

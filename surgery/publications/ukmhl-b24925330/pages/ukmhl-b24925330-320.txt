MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 29S It has already been obfer ved, that a phlogiflic diathefis prevents the a diion of the digitalis on the fyflem, but I do not think that digitalis pre- vents the operation of antiphlogiftic remedies; and on this principle I have frequently thought neceflary to anticipate the approach of this fecond ftage of the difeafe, by loading the conftitution with the digitalis before the termination of the phlogiflic diathefis had taken place; for by this method, when the difeafe is fufficiently reduced to admit of the operation of the digitalis, the conftitution will be previoufly charged for that pur- pofe, and its influence will then become apparent. And I have frequent- ly with this view, after having carried the bleeding fyftem to its full ex- tent, finifhed the cure by fufpending the difeafe by means of the digitalis and deftroying the remaining influence of the phlogiflic diathefis by a con- tinued ufe of purgative medicines, given forfome weeks every fecond or third morning. This, in other words, may be faid to be removing the dif- eafe from the original fituation in the lungs by one remedy, and carrying it off through the inteftines by another. One of the mo ft fatisfadlory experiments of the treatment of phthifis pulmonalis, that ever I have met with, was terminated in this manner. It was not a cafe fimilar to the fecond which I have noticed on this fubjedt, where at a hopelefs period of the difeafe a Tingle medicine was given for a week or a fortnight, and the patient recovered without any other affift- ance; but it fur nifties us with an inftruclive example of a long continued conteft between the falutary powers of medicine, and the deftrudiive in- fluence of difeafe. I have already repeatedly obferved that the firft objedl in phthifis pul- monalis is to deftroy the phlogiflic diathefis; but the fymptoms of gene- ral

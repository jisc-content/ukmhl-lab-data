MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 254 In this accumulated ftate of difeafe I am apprehenfive that the beft re- gulated plan of praftice will in general not fucceed; and it appears to me to be a degree of difeafe, againfl which all the powers of medicine will be oppofed in vain. If this is what Mr. Sharp terms a fpreading gangrene, it is not probable that the bark fhould prove an efficacious remedy; though I have no doubt of its falutary influence at a more early period and in a lefs degree of dif- eafe. But if the bark will not fucceed, I fhould not place the leaft confi- dence in other cordials; on this part of the fubjeft I cannot fubferibe to Mr. Sharp’s opinion, and have no doubt but the bark is the mo ft power- ful cordial that can be made ufe of on this occafion. But if we compare Mr. Sharp’s practical obfervations with the above theoretical analyfls of the difeafe, we fhall find that, when the difeafe flops fpontaneoufly, as he has obferved does frequently happen, the degree of difeafe is one fhort of the laft I have here deferibed; and if I agree with him that the bark does not poffefs the powers of flopping the progrefs of fpreading gangrene, I have no doubt but it will frequently prevent the fpreading gangrene taking place, if it is given in fufficient quantity at the critical commencement of the local affe6lion. With refpe£l to the quantity of bark that may be thought neceffary on fuch occafions, it will be difficult to give a general opinion. In different inftances it will vary according to circumftances, andmuftat laft be con- fidered a diferetionary bufinefs. In thofe cafes, where I have thought the bark moft fuccefsful, I think the

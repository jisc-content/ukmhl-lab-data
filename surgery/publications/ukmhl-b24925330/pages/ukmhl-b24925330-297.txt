MEDICINAL TREATMENT 273 are informed that inflammation is fometimes the confequence of colic*, and that this becomes the caufe of ileus, which was before onlv confidered as a fuperior degree of the fame difeafeand though in the conclufion he feems undetermined in his opinion, yet as inflammation is admitted to be the eifeft of colic and caufe of ileus, it is a fubjetf that demands the greateft pra&ical caution, as a Angle dofe of opium would frequently de- termine the fate of the patient. If in cafes of violent pain in the bowels attended with conflipation and tenfion of the abdomen, whatever might be the name of the difeafe, if in fuch cafes opium was alone depended upon, or even if a fingle dofe of laudanum was prefcribed under fuch circumflances, I fliould not hefitate to give it as mv decided opinion, that the author of fuch a prefcription muff at the time of writing be under the delufive influence of diffufible flimuli. Do£!or Heberden has long ago obferved that pain will not quicken the * “ The enteritis Ins likewife its own peculiar caufes, as fupervening upon the fpafmotlic colic, incarcerated hernia, and volvulus.” Cullen’s Praftice of Phyfic, vol 1, page 429, + “ In thefe circurnftances of inverfion the difeafe has been named ileus, or the iliac paflion, and this has been fjppofed to be a peculiar difeafe diflmft from colic; but So me it appears that the two dffcafes are owing to the fame proximate caufe, and have the fame fvmptoms, only in different degree. “ The colic is often without any pyrexia attending it. Sometimes, however, an inflammation comes upon the part of the inteftine efpecially affebled ; and this inflammation aggravates all the fvmptoms of the difeafe, being probably what brings on the moft ccnfiderable inverfion of the perif- taltic motion ; and, as the flercoraccous vomiting is what efpecially diflinguifhes the ileus, this has been c' nfideied as always depending on an inflammation of the inteflines.” Cullen’s Prtftite of Phy- fic, vol. 4, page 20 and 2s.

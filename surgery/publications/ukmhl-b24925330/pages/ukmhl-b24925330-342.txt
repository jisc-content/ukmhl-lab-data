MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 318 But After this a third cafe is defcribed, in which the recovery is equally miraculous; but as it frequently happens in formidable inftances of putrid fever that the patient will continue in a hate of delirium for a week, and fometimes for a fortnight, and after this recover, it muft appear to be an haPiy and unjuftifiable deeifion in the prefent inPance to limit the fhort remains of life to twenty-four hours ; and that there cannot remain a doubt with all thofe who are capable of forming a judgement on this fub- je&, that, if the recovery was as here hated, the patients were not in fuch a ftate of certain danger as is here reprefented when the yeah was had recource to ; as a recovery from fuch a ftate of danger, in thirty-two minutes, cannot to any rational mind appear within the limits of probability. / I have frequently feen inftances of putrid fever where I could not an- fwer for the life of the patient for twelve hours together, and yet they have lived for years. But in fuch cafes, where the event is doQbtful, it muft of courfe be impoftible to prognofticate with certainty ; and if the danger had been as great as here reprefented, the recovery would not have been fo expeditious and fuccefsful. It is ridiculous to fuppofe that two fpoonfuls of yeaft fhould, under fuch circumftances, in fifteen minutes give a fulnefs to the pulfe and produce fuch wonderful effedls, except this falutarv ferment had been immediately introduced into the blood veftels by the ingenious art of transfufton ; and thus, by one happy exertion of philofophical dexterity, the whole mafs of blood might have been excited into reanimated motion. But one of thefe cafes is fandlioned by the con- curring teftimony of an apothecary in the county of Leicefter, and per- haps this may be confidered a fpecies of authority that but few will pre- fume to call in queftion.

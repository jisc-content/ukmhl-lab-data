SECTION VII. THE PRINCIPLES OF TOPICAL BLEEDING DEMON- STRATED, AND THE INEFFICACY EXPLAINED. "O E-FORE the difcovery of the circulation of the blood, it was more dif- ficult to form an opinion what would be the effe&s of bleeding on the fanguiferous fyflem, or to eftimate how far its influence might ex- tend. It is now near two centuries fince this difcovery was revealed to the public; and even at the prefent day it is not yet determined, whether the effefts of bleeding are limited to the parts near to that from which the blood is taken; or whether its influence is equally diflributed to all parts of the fyflem.

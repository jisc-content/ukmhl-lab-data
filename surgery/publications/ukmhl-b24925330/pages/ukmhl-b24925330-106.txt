PHYSIOLOGY, 82 The diaftole of the aorta takes place in confequence of a frefh fupply of blood being fent from the left ventricle of the heart; and as this quan- tity of blood mu ft pafs the femilunar valves, thefe valves muft of necefti- ty be open during the diaftole of the arteries, and confequently it is im- poflible that the fituation of the valves (hould correfpond with this de- fcription during the diaftole of the aorta. When the artery is in its diaftole, the valves recede from each other; but if the expanfion of the aorta was fuch as to extend the valves till they were brought into right lines, then the margin of the valves could not make a curve inward as is here ftated; and if, at the utmoft expanfion of the aorta, the valves were fufficiently lax to make a curve, inftead of approaching the centre of the artery as is here fuppofed, the curve would be dire&ed towards the fides of the artery by the impetus of the blood; and if they were brought into right lines by the expanfion of the artery, they could not clofe immediate*, ly on the commencement of the contra&ion. It is therefore evident that they never are brought fo much on theftretch as to prevent their complete approach to each other, even when the artery is in its full diaftole; but that they open with the approaching current, and clofe to prevent its return; and inftead of being formed into lines and triangles, will lie at liberty, loofe and relaxed, floating in the ftream. The fubjeft is plain in a ftate of nature, and eafy to be underftood; it is the explanation that is fo particularly myfterious; and as for the ftate- ment before us, it difplays the affeffation of philofophy, and is a complete burlefque on mathematical demonftration.

152 THE PRINCIPLES OF I mufi acknowledge that we afterwards meet with two very curious ex* amples, one of continuous fympathy, the other of contiguous fympathy; which for the fatisfaclion of the reader it will be right to notice. In one infiance the difeafe was cured by a local application, in the other the re- medy was applied to a difiant part. Our ingenious author obferves, “we have the cramp in the leg cured by a gentle irritation round the lower , part of the thigh, fuch as a garter, which may be faid to arife from deriva» tion or fympathy this muft certainly be acknowledged to be a firiking example of the fuccefsful application of the remedy to the part affedied. The next is an illuftration of the do£trine of fympathy hill more inftruc- tive: he fays, “I have known, in a nervous girl, a pain in one arm cured by rubbing the other.” The pain was in one arm, the remedy was applied to the other; any perfon, lefs converfant with the laws of fympathy, would in all probability have applied the remedy to the part in pain; and con- fequently if the fuccefs depended on the remedy being applied to a dif- tant part, both dodtor and patient muff certainly have been difappointed. But the girl was nervous, and much might depend on that circumftance; it therefore becomes a queftion of fome importance, and well worthy the attention of the curious, to determine where the rubbing ought to have been applied if the girl had not been nervous. And if the folution of this queftion is neceflary to a full inveftigation of the laws of fympathy, and topical bleeding is to be explained on the fame principles, we muft not expedl the dodlrine of topical bleeding to be eftablilhed on a permanent bafts, until this important queftion is decided. Leeches are fometimes made ufe of in ecchymofts; but although Mr. * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 353* John

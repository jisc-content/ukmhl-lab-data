ifiS INFLAMMATION AND diminifh the gout in any manner fimilar to that by which bleeding ana purging will corredl other fpecies of inflammation. But if we have no antidote for the gout* we are amply furnifhed with a variety of remedies for thofe difeafes that are frequently connected with it, which not only interrupt its progrefs, but very much impede its falu- tary termination. For inftance, if the gout is connected with fever, it is always right that this fever fhould be deftroyed; but a much more im- portant connexion that we frequently meet with is, gout and a true phlo- gillie diathefis of the fyftem ; under fuch circumftances, bleeding and pur- ging are not only fa-fe and efficacious remedies, but often abfolutely ne- celfary for the prefervation of the life of the patient. For I never met with a cafe, of what is called gout in the head, that was not attended with a phlogiftic diathefis and fizy blood ; a queftion then arifes whether this difeafe in the head is purely gouty, or whether the gout, which may have quitted the extremities, is under fuch circumftances fufpended by the fuperior influence of another difeafe. That we may form an intelligible idea of this complicated ftate of difl. eafe, it will be neceflary to confider how one morbid action will influence or fufpend another. This is a fubjett that is particularly noticed by Mr. I. Hunter, and boafted of as a new difeovery ; he has given an example of the meafies having nrft got pofleflion of the conftitution, and fufpending the progrefs of the fmall pox : but the cafe is not without a precedent, and the dotfrine is not new, as we meet with a fimilar inftance in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries of a more early date; and with refpeff to the laws of the animal ceconomy, on which this morbid conteft is fup- pofed

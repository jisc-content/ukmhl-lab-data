PHYSIOLOGY. 49 Many fyftem-builders have made fimilar attempts, fo that this is not the firft; inftance we meet with, when theoretical {peculations, and pra&ical inferences have been at variance. When inflammation was fuppofed to depend on obftru&ion, it was cured by deobftruents; but when fpafm be- came the caufe of this difeafe, then antifpafmodics became the remedy. If then evacuations were made ufe of in both inftances, in the former they afledas deobftruents, in the latter as antifpafmodics. The truth is, that the theory and praflice of phyfic have not that connexion, which fome fpeculative writers and equally credulous readers have been difpofed to imagine. I do not intend .to infinuate, that the theory of medicine is either ufe- lefs or unneceflary; it may ferve on many occafions to conneft our ideas, and prove highly inftrumental in the arrangement of praftical informati- on; but it is an objeflof great importance, to diftinguifh between the hy- pothefts of fpeculation, and that theory which is founded on the evidence of nature, in a ftate of health, and the phenomena of difeafe. When any fpeculative opinion, that has the appearance of ingenuity has once become an objeff of public attention; if the means of deteff ing the impofttion are not within the limits of general obfervation, it foon becomes eftablilhed as an important truth. If we examine the theory of blood globules, and the ufe of the microf- cope when applied to anatomical purpofes, the more attention we pay to the fubjett, the more we fhall be aftonifhed, that ingenious men fhould be led away by fuch vifionary do&rines. Malpighi and Leuwenhoek firft gave rife to this chimera, and the credulous public has ever fince been either dazzled by the blaze, or duped by the delufion, O I (hall Â«

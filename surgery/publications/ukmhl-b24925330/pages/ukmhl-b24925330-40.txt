THE DIVISION OF MORTIFICATION 32 tin&ion was not fo clearly pointed out. From Wifeman’s time the fame difeafe may evidently be traced through many fubfequent publications; but the remedy was firft difcovered, and the difeafes diftinguifhed andde- fcribed as a new Species, by Mr. Pott. It was neceffary to notice this circumflance for the purpofe of avoiding confufion, and to prevent the reader from thinking of one difeafe, when I was treating of another. With refpefr to thofe who wrote before Mr. Pott fet this fubjeft in a clear point of view, inaccuracy on their part would admir of fome apology, but, fince that period, inaccuracy or igno- rance muft be considered unpardonable. / The obfervations we meet with refpe&ing the powers of the bark as a remedy in mortification, appears to me as a prefatory difcuflion introduc- tory to his defcription of this Species of difeafe, in which he found by ex- perience that bark had no influence; it is therefore reafonable to conclude* that, one particular difeafe being the foie obje£l of attention, the ufe of the bark in every other kind of mortification pafled unnoticed; for it is evi- dent the fubje6l is only mentioned in general terms, as if the author wifh- ed cautioufly to avoid giving his opinion in full on that part of the quef- tion. Not that I am Satisfied that he ever formed an opinion refpefling the powers of the bark in mortification; for if we may judge by the writ- ten evidence with which he has favoured the public, I think it appears evi- dent that his knowledge of this remedy, and internal medicine in general* was either much inferior to his chirurgical abilities, or elfe that this part was pafled over, as a fubjeft more immediately connected with another branch of the profeflion.

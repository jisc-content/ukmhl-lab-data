63 PHYSIOLOGY. Mr. Hewfon is the next author that we have to appeal to, he is faid “ to have been at great pains to examine the blood in the microfcope, and has given us figures of the different fhapes of thole globulesbut Mr. I. Hunter adds that “there is reafon to think he may have been deceived in the manner l have juft mentioned.” If Mr. I. Hunter is of opinion that Mr. Hewfon was deceived, who has given defcriptions of his experiments; I hope I (hall not be fufpefled of want of candour, if I exprefs my fufpicions of the opinion before us, where not a fingle expet iment is defcribed, or reprefentation given of the refult; and if 1 add in his own words, that “this is probably an optical deceptionf ^ at lead 1 fhall take the liberty of doubting the fa£l until I find it fupport= ed by proper evidence, Mr, Hewfon fuppoled that blood globules were formed in the fpleen, becaufe, fays he, they are found in its excretory dufts, but unfortunately the excretory dufts of the fpleen have never yet been difcovered; to re= snedy this imperfedlion the lymphatics of the fpleen were fuppofed to fup~ ply the deficiency; but the fecretions-of other glands are not found in their lymphatics, the liver is furnilhed with lymphatics, but has alfo its proper excretory dufts.

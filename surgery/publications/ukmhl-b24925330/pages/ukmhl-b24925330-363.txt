PART OF SURGERY. 339 I fhall not attempt to juftify what was done in this cafe, or recommend the fame pradice on fimilar occafions; I only wifh to defcribe the fads as an iilufiration of the prefent fubjed. The attempt to unite the parts by the firfi intention did not fucceed, and mortification took place in thofe parts that were deprived of the cir« culation: As foon as the mortification was difcovered, the foot was divi- ded up between the third and fourth toe, and the incifion met at right angles by a fecond on the inferior part of the foot, by which the injured parts were completely removed, and not a fingle difficulty afterwards, fucceeded to interrupt the regular procefs of' the cure. The quefiion then will be whether the operation was too infignificant to affed the con- futation, or whether the conflitution was in a ftate fufceplible of its influ- ence. If we refer to the conclufion of Mr. Pott’s obfervations on the morti- fication of the toes and feet, we.(hall find that he particularly advifes againft operations of much Iefs importance. It is not my intention to re- prefent thefe as two fimilar fpecies of difeafe; but if they are not perfed- ly fimilar, the. objedions to amputation are in many refpeds applicable to both infiances. Mr. Pott obferves, that “if the parts adhere by only a fingle living fibre it ought not to be divided,” whereas in the crfe above bated feveral inches of living fubftance were cut in two. .On the pre- fent occafion it is moft probable that the parts beyond the incifion died away for want of a neceffary connedion with the vital organs, and that mortification took place in the extremity of the foot not in confequence of adive difeafe, but becaufe the parts were cut off from the original fource of the vital powers.

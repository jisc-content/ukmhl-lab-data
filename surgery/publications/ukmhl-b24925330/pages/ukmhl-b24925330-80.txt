PHYSIOLOGY. 56 of inaccuracy. He fays, “the globules of white ferum differ from the red globules in colour'35',” and concludes his experimental inveftigation of the ferum of the blood with this obfervation, “that the white part of the white ferum funk in waterf.” That white and red fhould differ in colour, is here reprefented as an important difcovery. With refpeft to the white part of the white ferum f nking in water the faff might have been as here dated; but this explanation is imperfeff, for as the white part of the white ferum is not fuppofed to be the only part, the other parts fhould have been defcribed, and fatisfaflory information given what became of them. The red part of the'blood is the next objeft of our attention; this, we are told, is of lefs importance than the coagulating lymph, and the reafon is a curious one; all animals that have a complete circulation and are conddered of the mod perfefl kind havered blood; but as the blood of fome reptiles and infers is not red, confequently the red part is of infe- rior importance. But as quadrupeds, which are confidered the drd clafs of animals, have all red blood, I fhould fuppofe that the red part of the blood is as important a part of their duids, as the lymph and ferum may be of other animals; and confequently, fo far from confidering the red part of the blood of the lead importance, I fhould rather edimate its im- portance by the perfeffion of the clafs of animals which it invariably be- longs to. Why this quedion of precedency diould be fo warmly contended for, * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 39. f I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 28. I am

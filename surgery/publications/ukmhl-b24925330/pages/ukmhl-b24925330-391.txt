367 PART OF SURGERY. When treating of the time proper for the removing of incurable parts, fie obferves that ee Perhaps it 'fhouid not be done immediately upon the receiving of the injury, except where it is fufpefted that the inflammation in confequence of the accident will kill if he meant by terminating in mortification, why not exprefs himfelf accordingly, as the two are with- out doubt very different kinds of difeafe. Certainly, if inflammation is cured, mortification is prevented, but I know of no other confequence of inflammation that, generally fpeaking, is likely to terminate in death; and this, I believe, is the firlt inflance where amputation was recommended as a remedy for inflammation, and mortification was never mentioned. The queflion of fcience in fuch cafes is limited to a narrow compafs, and it muff appear evident that all operations, from the extraÂ£ling of a ball to the amputation of a limb, fhouid either be performed before inflam- mation takes place, or deferred till all difeafed adlion ceafes. But on this fubjedl we meet with no diredlion; I final 1 therefore proceed to ex- amine how far his. profeffional policy merits our attention. On this occafion delay alfo feems to be the leading objedl; but whatever is right in a fcientific view fhouid, on all occafions, regulate our condu6! as much as is confident with the fituation. But if the circumftances are fuch that the operations, which would otherwife be neceffary, cannot be performed before inflammation has taken place, the didlates of fcience are that it muff then be deferred until all difeafed atdion has fubfided; but if the hate of the injury is of that degree to render death inevitable * I.

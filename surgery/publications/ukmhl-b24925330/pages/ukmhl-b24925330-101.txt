77 PHYSIOLOGY. The Heart, which is the origin of the circulation, is a mufcular vifcus, whofe action is excited by the blood that is poured into the different ca- vities ; for we find that, the inflant the auricles are filled with blood, they both immediately contrad and difcharge their contents into the ventri- cles ; the auricles then become relaxed, and the ventricles contrad to pro- pel the blood into the arteries, the right into the pulmonary artery, and the left into the aorta. The ventricles, then, having loft their ftimulus, inftantly become relax- ed and paffive. The diaftole of the heart is not a flate of expanded di- latation, but only of paffive relaxation. This differs very much from the nature of the diafiole of the arteries during life; but after death the ffate of the left auricle and ventricle are perfedly fimilar to that of the whole arterial fyflem. i The right fide of the heart, which remains full of blood, preferves a ftate of tenfion after death, and the mufcles that compofe the left ventricle, having been in an adive ftate when life terminated, continue in a con- traded ftate afterwards. But the left ventricle, on the contrary, having by its laft contradion difcharged its contents, and thereby loft its ftimulus to adion, is always after death found relaxed and flaccid like the arteries j which clearly proves that their adion depends on fimilar principles. It is not improbable that a partial attention to this circumftance has induced Mr. I. Hunter to obferve that “we very often find the heart large and flabby*,” but I fufped the ffatement to be inaccurate, and am of o- * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page, 148, w pinion

7 9 PHYSIOLOGY, heart and arteries, on the principle of the hydroflatic paradox; but it is evident that he neither underflood the hydroflatic paradox, nor the me- chanifm of the femilunar valves; and thefe valves have no aclive powers inherent in themfelves, but move obedient to the momentum of the blood. Mr. I. Hunter has added a new hypothefis on this fubjefl, and has at- tempted to explain the aflion of the femilunar valves; and to guard a- gainfl any miflake on the part of the reader, he has given diagrams by way of illuflration; but notwithflanding all this caution, he has defcribed the valves in an open flate during the fyflole of the aorta, and clofed during their diaflole. It is rather fingular, that an anatomift of fuch abilities fhould deliber- ately commit fuch an irreconcilable miflake; it is not a mere verbal in- accuracy, but a regular fyflem of argument founded in error; and what renders the whole more inexcufable is, that the diagrams, which were in- tended as illuflrations, mufl to any unprejudiced mind have pointed out the inconfiflency. He fuppofes that the three femilunar valves at the en- trance of the aorta are, at the inflant of its extreme diaflole, brought into right lines; forming a triangle, whofe outer angles correfpond with the circular dimenfions of the artery. It is not neceffary to copy the figures, as a verbal defcription will be fufficient for our prefent purpofe; and tliofe who think neceffary may refer to the original flatement. the arterial refiftance is increafed, or the mufcular force of the heart abated, the valves of the heart are opened by a proportionably fmaller column of blood ; which, in a natural eafy fyftole, is feldommcre than half the contents of either ventricle; as in a natural eafy expiration, the lungs feldom expel more than half their contained air.

MEDICINAL TREATMENT. 242 ing and opium, as if there was not a queftion refpe&ing the propriety of their ufe in the fame difeafe. Mr. Biizard fays, “During the fir ft ftage, the violence of fymptoms of irritation and inflammation is to be modera- ted by bleeding, purging, and fmall dofes of antimony, opium, diluting draughts of watery drinks, &c. Bleeding fhould, however, be allowed with the ftrifieft regard to the pulfe, as expreflive of the ftrength of the body. It may be copious at firft, efpecially from the divided veffels them- felves; but it fhould be repeated rather in moderate quantities than large- ly. Topical bleeding, by leeches, will prove more immediately benefi- cial than by the lancet, and lefs weakening in its remote effects This we find is giving us a matter of opinion without bringing for- wards any arguments in fupport of it; and when we compare the two opinions we fhall find that neither of them had any criterion by which to regulate their conduft. Mr. Chriffie who wrote from Holland fays, “In gun-fhot wounds it rarely fails that a confiderable degree of febrile afiion commences, and I know no inflance wherein the free ufe of the lancet affords greater relief; though the inteflines are alfo to be kept open, pur- ging, for obvious reafons, cannot well be fully employed. Opiates, in * full dofes, muff alfo occafionally be had recourfe tot.” It muff be evident to every one, capable of forming an opinion, that the directions are all given in general terms; but they are objefis of great importance in the praftice of furgery, and highly merit our attention. * Blizard’s Le&ures on the fituation of the blocdveffels and the nature of gun-fhot wounds, editi- on third, page 55. + Medical and Phyfical Journal, vol. 3, page 143.

The effedts of the warm bath will frequently appear fatisfadfory to the fuperficial obferver, whilft the penetrating eye of judicious criticifm will fee through thedelufion; in many inftances the remedy may be applied when the difeafe is in a fink- ing (late and the event is certain, but the powers of any remedy can only become confpicuous where the event is uncertain and the falutary change depends on the effedis of the applications. I fhall not attempt to form a new fyftem of obfervations on the powers of the warm bath, or to repeat the experiments above-mentioned, as I had much rather that this part of the argument (hould reft on any authority in preference to my own; for if I was to make a number of experiments for the purpofe of forming a bafts for a new hvpothefis, I might then be fufpedled of accomodating the fadls to the nature of the argument. But I wilh as much as poftible to avoid the fpeculations of theory, and have endeavoured to ftate plain fadts, and unadorned opinions; the one free from difguife, the other clear from obfcurity.

PART OF SURGERY. 363 had been a common occurrence, he mu ft certainly have met with frequent inftances, and he might have given us examples, without expofmg the parties, much more confiftent and natural than this abortive deformity of an heated imagination. He fays, “a reafon given for opening gun-fhot wounds is, that it takes off the tention arifing from the inflammation, and gives the part liberty but this obfervation appears tome fo irrational, that I cannot fuppofe any one, who had the leaft pretenfions to a knowledge of furgery, would be guilty of fuch an inconfiftency. If this or any fimilar obfervation had ever been made in print, it fhould have been brought in fupport of the accufation, as it is not neceffary to add imaginary difficulties to the prac- tice of furgery, when the imperfe&ions are fufficiently numerous already. " H The fame principle, which fhould regulate our conduCHn inferior ope- rations, will alfo in general be found equally applicable to all; but when we meet with opinions without any rational foundation, or practical di- rections unconnected with fcientifc principles, it is reafonabie to expeCl contradiction and obfcurity; if on this fubjeCt Mr. I. Hunter had pre- ferred an accurate uniformity, his opinions might have proved lefs vulner- able, and his authority might have fuperfeded the united dictates of Sharp and Pott’s opinion. He firft obferves that **the removal of injured parts fhould not be done immediately,” but direCiJy offers an argument to the contrary* * I. Hunter on gun-fhot wounds, page 534.

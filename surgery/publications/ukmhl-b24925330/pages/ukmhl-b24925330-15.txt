In Mr. Gooch’s fecond volume we meet with a great variety of this kind of inftruments; but Mr. Pott contributed much more to the improvement of furgery, by pointing out the soft advantageous pofition of a frabtured limb, than all thefe inftrumental Genii put together.

The want of attention to the mechanifm of nature is the original, caufe of all thefe prabtical imperfections; but the fcience

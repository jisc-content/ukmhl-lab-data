Roughly speaking, a man who adopts one of the above standard diets will consume about 3 lbs. of solid food daily, containing about 23 oz. of dry solids, or nearly an ounce per hour. The amount of mineral matter and water which he requires will be considered later. It must be clearly realised that such standard diets are only of limited applicability. They cannot be rigidlj' enforced in all cases and under all circumstances. They are useful, however, as furnishing one with some idea of the amount and kind of nutriment which should be supplied to a healthy man doing a moderate amount of work. Thus they are of great assistance in constructing diet tables for public institutions in which the inmates are unable to have a fi'ee choice of foods, as, for example, in prisons, workhouses, hospitals, and the like. In apply- ing them to individuals respect must be had to various modifying factors, of which the chief are age and sex, height and build, work and rest, climate and sun'oundings, and, last but by no means least, personal peculiarity. The in- fluence of each of these may now be briefly considered. VOL. II Modifying Factors. — (1) Age and Sex.— Children require relatively more building material, fuel, and muscle food than adults. They require more building material because they must not only keep their tissues in repair but add to them by growth ; they require more fuel because, like all small animals, they have a large surface compared to their bulk, and so lose heat rapidly; they require more muscle food because of their restlessness and bodily activity in jalay. Hence children require a large amount of food, and the importance of proteid and fat to them especially can hardly be over-stated. With the aged the reverse holds good. The assimilative power of their tissues is on the wane and their bodily activities restricted, hence their diet should be smaller than that of middle life. One may easily underfeed the yomig, but one is apt to forget that it is almost as easy to over- feed the old. Women require relatively less food than men, not only on account of the lighter nature of their work, but also, probably, from their possessing a slower rate of meta- bolism. Roughly speaking, a woman may be regarded as requiring only 8 parts of food to every 10 required by a man. As compared with the food of a man at moderate work, the proportions for children may be stated thus :— 23

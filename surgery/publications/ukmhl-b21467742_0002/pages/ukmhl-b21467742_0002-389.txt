The articles in the first two groups are ob- viously those which make least demands upon the digestive powers of the stomach. (b) The capal)ility which a food has of ab- sorption in the intestine must be clearly distin- guished from its digestibility in the stomach. The most easily digested foods are by no means necessarily those which are most completely absorbed and vice versa. The following table (chiefly after Rubncr) shows the degree to which the nutritive constituents of some typical foods are absorlied :— Food.; Pprci'utagt^ Uiiabsorbed. Dry Sub- stance. Protpid. Fat. Carbo- hydrate.

It must not be supposed that it is desirable that a food should be completely absorbed into the lilood. The contrary is the case. The intestine demands a certain amount of insoluble residue or "ballast" to serve as a stimulus to its peri- stalsis. Hence the advisability of selecting foods which leave a considerable residue for cases of constipation, and of those which are very completely absorbed in cases of diarrhoia. A study of the table will be of assistance in making such a selection. (3) A good food must not only contain a high percentage of nutrients, and be easily digested and well absorbed ; it must also l)c cheap. One may best arrive at the relative economic value of a food by calculating either the total number of Calories or the amount of building material obtained in it for a given sum. Thus one finds, proceeding on the first plan, that a shilling's worth of— Wheat flour yields 13,782 Calories. Oatmeal ,, 9,189 Potatoes ,, 7,689 Beans ,, 7,630 Fat salt pork ,, 6,825 Sugar ,, 6,292 Margarine ,, 6,164 ,, Cheese ,, 3,642 Butter 3,082 Milk 2,178 Leg of imittou,, 1,076 Sirloin of beef ,, 870 Eggs 768 Cod-tish 656 [f the amount of proteid obtained be taken as the standard, one gets such results as these : 1 lb. of proteid in peas costs 7d.; oatmeal, 7kl.; bread, Is. 6d. ; milk, 2s. 2d. ; beef, 2s. 8d. A glance at the tables will show- that both as regards the total number of Calories yielded and the amount of building material obtained, the vegetable foods are very superior to animal products. Amongst the cheapest of the latter in both respects are cheese and milk. It must be clearly realised that the maxim " cheap and nasty" does not apply to foods. High price and high nutritive value are not synonymous. The price of a food in the market is determined more by such considera- tions as flavour and rarity than by chemical composition or digestibility. Thus a pound of cod at threepence yields just as much nourish- ment as a similar quantity of sole at eighteen- pence; and common arrowroot at fourpence is of the same chemical and physiological value as Bermuda at two shillings. AxDiAi, Foods 1. Jleat.—The flesh of animals, which con- stitutes meat, consists of muscle fibres held together by connective tissue. The fibres vary- in length and thickness. If they are long and coarse, as in the leg of a crab, the meat is less easily digested than when the fibres are shorter and more delicate, as in the breast of a chicken. The fibres contain the muscle plasma, or "juice of the meat, the chief ingredients of which are water, the proteid called myosin, a certain amount of haemoglobin, certain " extractive" bodies, the best known being creatin, and some mineral salts, chiefly compoimds of potassium and phosphoric acid. Rigor mortis is due to clotting of the myosin, and meat in that condi- tion is tough. By and by acids are developed

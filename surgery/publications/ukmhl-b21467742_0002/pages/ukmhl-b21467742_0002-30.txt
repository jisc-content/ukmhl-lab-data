12 BRONCHI, DISEASES OF—BRONCHITIS mainly bronchial, firstly in the anatomical arrangement of the blood-supply, and secondly in the protecting action of the basement mem- brane, while even the marked variation in the clinical characters between bronchitis affecting the larger and smaller tubes very largely depends on their different anatomical structure and rela- tions. The noteworthy point in regard to the vascular system of the lung consists in its double circulation, the blood-supply for nutri- tion and function being separately provided for ; thus the main bronchi and the tissues of the lung are supplied, not by the pulmonary artery, but by the bronchial arteries which are derived from the aorta. Furthermore, the bronchial veins communicate freely with the pulmonary artery, and in the smaller bronchi the blood is returned almost wholly by branches of the pulmonary vein to the left side of the heart; consequently any obstruction to the return of blood to the left side of the heart will at once result in congestion of the smaller bronchi. Moreover, while it seems probable that the palmonaiy arteries are not subject like most arteries to vasomotor control, this does not apply to the bronchial arteries, and thus a variety of causes acting either directly, or in- directly by reflex action, are able to cause a vascular dilatation which may be limited to the bi'onchial tubes, as distinguished from the air- vesicles which are supplied by the capillary plexus of the pulmonary vessels, and which are directly concerned with the function of respira- tion—aeration of the blood. The right and left bronchi divide and sub- divide dichotomously within the lung until ultimately the minute terminal lironchioles end in the infundibula and air-vesicles. In a trans- verse section of one of the middle-sized bronchi three coats may be distinguished — the inner mucosa, the middle muscularis, and the outer fibrous coat, which contains the cartilages. Further examination shows that the mucosa is composed of (1) an epithelial lining with three layers of cells — the single layer of superficial columnar ciliated epithelium, an intermediary layer of transitional or rounded cells, actively germinating to form the superficial columnar cells and mucous corpuscles, and a single deep layer of flat nucleated cells ; (2) an inner fibrous coat, abundantly supplied with branches from the bronchial artery, and consisting of bundles of fibrous tissue with numei'ous lymphatic spaces containing lymphatic corpuscles between them ; and (3) a homogeneous, hyaline, structureless basement membrane giving attachment to the epithelial covering which it eff'ectually separates from the vessels and lymphatic vessels of the inner fibrous coat. Hamilton has shown that the part played by this basement membrane in bronchitis is of great importance, in that it imparts a superficial character to the catarrhal affections of tiie bronchi; for though it becomes swollen and oedematous in bronchitis, and per- mits the transudation of serous fluid into the lumen of the tube, no leucocytes appear to pass from the deeper structures to the surface of the mucous membrane, nor can inhaled particles of foreign matter, like coal-dust in a miner's lung, become carried down to the tissues of the bronchi. Such particles do not enter the lymphatics of the lung except through the air- vesicles. In the middle - sized and smaller bronchi the muscular coat is well developed, and it is continued down to the infundibula, where it is represented only by a few scattered fibres. The physiological action of this muscle is not known exactly, but it probably regulates the intra - alveolar air - tension, and protects the air-vesicles from undue pressure in coughing and other respiratory acts. Consequently, as Hamilton has demonstrated, this coat generally becomes greatly hypertrophied in chronic bron- chitis, owing to the constantly recurring cough. Gairdner, in discussing the action of expec- torant medicines, arrives at the conclusion that expectoration depends more upon the expulsive mechanism of these muscular fibres than upon the alterations in the consistency of the secre- tions. Their action is probably somewhat analogous to intestinal peristalsis, and the beneficial result of emesis in certain cases of bronchitis is due to the remedies increasing the action of the bronchial muscles directly, rather than to the vomiting, which is perhaps only a concomitant, but in no way essential, effect. Further evidence of this important physiological action is afforded by the fact that, when the nuiscular coat loses its functional activity, as in the more serious cases of bronchitis, the bron- chial tubes dilate and become filled with secre- tion. Walshe, referring to Radcliffe Hall's researches, considers that in the calm, and still more in the forced respiration of health, the muscular coat possesses the power of reducing the tubes to less than their medium size. But in ))ronchitis the muscular coat loses its contrac- tile force, the elasticity of the inflamed bronchi being likewise impaired, and so liecome intel- ligible the tendency to dilatation of the tubes, the laboured expiration and the accumulation of mucus. It is not improbable that, like the alae nasi and vocal cords, the bronchial muscle may rhythmically dilate and contract with inspira- tion and expiration. I believe that this largely explains why in bronchitis and asthma the dyspnoea is expiratory rather than inspiratory, inasmuch as the muscular spasm is more or less inhibited during inspiration, permitting air to be inspired more freely than during the period of bronchial spasm it can be expired, consequently the lungs become distended and emphysematous. In the larger and middle-sized bronchi the outer fibrous coat contains cartilaginous plates, but not in the smallest bronchi, which consist of a

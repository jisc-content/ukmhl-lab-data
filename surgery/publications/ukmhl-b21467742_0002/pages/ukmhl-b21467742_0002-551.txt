EAR: MIDDLE EAR, CHRONIC NON-SUPPURATIVE DISEASE 517 cases from those of senile nerve deafness {vide vol. i. " Anditory Nerve "). The treatment in these cases is general ; no local treatment is of any service. Tests for Diagnosing Middle Ear from In- ternal Ear Disease.—These are chiefly of two varieties :—• {(i) By comparing the air and bone conduc- tion in the patient, or with the normal, by means of a medium C tuning-fork. These tests vary in detail, but are based on the broad fact that in any external or middle ear disease bone conduction is greater than air in the patient, and is increased when compared with the normal, the converse holding in internal ear affections. The tests known as " Weber's " and " Rinne's" are those usually employed. "(Jju-diner Browne's" and " Schwabach's " may be of service as supplementary tests. These are described on page 459. {h) By testing the range of tone hearing by means of tuning-forks, Galton's whistle, Konig's rods, and musical instruments. Broadly speaking, in middle ear disease high tones are heard better than low, and this may be carried to such an extent that the patient can hear a watch tick, and yet cannot hear thunder. In comparing watch and voice hear- ing, the former is often heard, comparatively I speaking, better than the latter. In internal ! ear disease high tones are usually lost. Tuning- forks, Galton's whistle, and occasionally musical instruments, are the means used to determine these points (see p. 459).

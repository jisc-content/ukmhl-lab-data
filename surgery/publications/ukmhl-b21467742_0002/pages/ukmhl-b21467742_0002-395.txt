Of tlie small amount of nitrogenous material which they do contain a large proportion is in the form of amido-bodies of little or no nutritive value. Hence they are too poor both in proteid and in fat to be fitted to constitute the main part of any diet. It is worth remembering that potatoes con- tain considerably less starch than bread, and may consequently be allowed in larger propor- tion than the latter to cases of mild diabetes. Tapioca, sago, and arrowroot are all prepara- tions containing about 88 per cent of starch, and practically no nitrogen. Alone they are of limited nutritive value, but are useful additions to foods, such as milk, which are richer in proteid. They rank amongst the most completely absorbed of all foods, which justifies their employment in cases of diarrhoea. 4. Green vegetables are of very low nutritive value, as is borne out by the following table representing their com- position. They owe their chief importance as regular articles of diet to the alkaline salts, especially of potash, wliich they contain. These are e.\- creted in the form of carbonates in the urine, and for that reason green vegetables should be freely consumed by patients with a tendency to gravel. Their richness in cellulose makes them difficult of digestion, but useful as supplying " intestinal ballast" in cases of constipation. They contain so little carbohydrate that they Composition of Vegetables Water. Nitro- Matter. 1 Fat. Carbo- liyih-ates. Mineral .Matter. Cellulo.se. p-uel Value per lb. Cals.

DEAFMUTISM 273 absence of liearing may be determined, but the amount of it cannot be ascertained till the deaf child has been so far educated as to understand the nature of the tests. Hence it is not worth while testing deaf children till they have been a year at school. In the interval, of course, the teacher has discovered any cases in which much hearing remains. The best tests are a dinner-bell so arranged that one note may be struck at a time, and the human voice used in the production of vowels and consonants. Bezold 1 of Munich used the whole gamut of the musical scale, and made a very interesting- discovery, viz. that in some cases islands of hearing exist in the surrounding ocean of silence or deafness. These islands, of course, represent the less injured pieces of the cochlea, and sometimes include only a note or two, some- times a half or a whole octave. These observa- tions of Bezold give a very strong support to the Helmholtzian theory of the function of the cochlea, but as the islands seldom coincide with the tones of the human voice, and as the con- tained tones are seldom very distinctly heard, they will probably be of little use in the practical training of the deaf. The DisTRiiiUTiOiV of Deafmutism.—The pro- portion of the deaf to the hearing varies in difterent coinitries, but it is governed by causes which operate alike in all coinitries. The following table gives a review of the deaf- mutism in various countries. It gives the number of deaf mutes per million living as well as the ordinary rate :— llate per million.

VOL. II in the deaf-mute rate arc various. Speaking generally, in prosperous flat countries like England, where the population is well fed and housed, where infectious diseases are carefully treated, and where communication is rapid, the j deaf-mute rate is moderate. On the other hand, in a mountainous country like Switzer- land, sparseness and stasis of the population make for increase of consanguineous union and an increase of congenital deafness, while the greater difficulty of combating the ravages of the exanthemata makes for an increase of acquired deafness, and the deaf-mute rate tends to be high. Similarly new colonies like Aus- tralia have a lower deaf-mute rate than the old colonies like Canada, consanguineous union being less common. Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment of Deafmutism.—When a dumb child is brought to the surgeon, the first thing he should do is to test his hearing. The child is, say, three years old, and his mother is dissatisfied with his speech. She does not think him dumb. Ho says Ma-ma and Pa-pa, and the mother thinks this proof that he hears. Further, she has noticed that loud sounds, such as the slamming of a door or the fall of a shovel, startle him. Now the facts are that the child says Ma-ma by imitation, ho lip-reads, and he turns at the loud noise, either because he hears nothing but very loud sounds, or because he feels the vibration carried along the floor or wall when the door is slammed. It is generally easy to settle the question of the presence or absence of hearing. Engage the attention of the child with your watch or knife, and let an assistant slip un- noticed behind the child's back with a gong or a bell, and while it is being sounded watch the child's face. If he hear he will turn, or wince, or wink, or in some way show by his expression that he has been affijcted by the sound. If he show nothing of this kind he will be too deaf for teaching in the schools for hearing children. The more accurate testing of deaf mutes is interesting and has been referred to, but this test is enough for the child as he is first brought before the surgeon. The prognosis in such cases is almost uniformly bad as far as the hearing is concerned. It is best to tell the mother that her child will be a deaf mute, and will require to be educated by special methods. In the meantime she may be made to look upon the development of hearing as a possibility, and she should be encouraged to ply the ears of her child with all sorts of sounds, especially with sounds of all pitches, e.g. the notes of the violin, piano, concertina, etc., with the view of en- couraging such development. But this is rare. I have seen such growth of hearing in one instance, or rather in two children in one family, but it is not common enough to set before the parents of deaf children as a probability. Apart from the deafness, the prognosis in older chil- 18

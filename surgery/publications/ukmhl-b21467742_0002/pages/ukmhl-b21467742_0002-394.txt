360 DIET Composition of Cereals^ ' The table represents the composition of the cereals in their crurie form. The ifigures are (compiled from a vast number of analyses, tlie data contained in the report on the composition of the cereals exhibited at the Columbian Exposition being freely used (U.S. Bull. 45). The proteid lias been calculated from the nitrogen, using the factor 6"7 for all except barley, maize, and buckwheat, where the factor 6 was employed.

Maize is superior to wheat in fatty material, while rice is characterised by its small proportion of both proteid and fat. Oats are about equal to maize in fat, and superior to wheat in proteid, and rank as the most nutritive of all cereals. A plateful of porridge is equal in nutritive value to three slices of bread. The chief product of wheat is, of course, bread. The following is the average ■composition of white and whole meal bread respectively:— White. Whole meal Water . 39 45 Proteid 6-5 6-3 Fat . . . 1 1-2 Carbohydrates 51-5 45-3 Mineral matter 1 1-2 The greater moistness of whole meal bread causes it to be hardly at all superior to white bread chemically, while physiologically it is found to be not so well absorbed. It is there- fore on no account to be preferred to white bread for ordinary use, though it is of value in cases of constipation. On the other hand, breads such as Hovis, which contain a large proportion of wheat germ, are peculiarly rich in proteid. of which they may contain as much as 9 per cent. Biscuits, being almost free from water, are more nourishing than bread, three pounds of the former being equal to five pounds of the latter. Thej are also very easily digested. Semolina is prepared from the central parts of hard wheat. It contains 10-6 per cent proteid. Macaroni and vermicelli, which are prepared from good wheat flour by mixing into dough and then drying, have a similar composition. Hominy consists of split maize and resembles the latter in its constituents, but has only \ per cent of fat. Cornflour consists of practically pure starch prepared from maize. 2. The Pulses have the following composi- tion :— Composition of Pulses {From the Means of many Analyses) They are richer in nitrogen than any other vegetable foods. This they owe to the presence of a vegetable proteid called legumin or vege- table casein. Legumin forms insoluble com- pounds with lime salts, which is the explanation of the advantage of cooking the jjulses in soft water. The pulses are somewhat difficult of digestion in the stomach, and are apt to produce a feeling of repletion, even in small amounts. In the intestiiie they are prone to excite flatulence owing to their richness in sulphur. Lentils have least tendency in this direction. As a group the pulses are well absorbed provided they be given in a state of fine division. Soy beans and pea-nuts are largely used in the preparation of diabetic foods owing to their poverty in carbohydrates. The preparation Revalenta Arabica consists mainly of Egyptian lentil flour. 3. The roots and tubers consist chiefly of starch, as the following table shows:— Wheat Oats (hulled) Barley Rye Maize Rice (unhulled) „ (hulled) . ,, (polished) Millet .

Cheese is a condensed and cheap form of animal food of high nutritive value, and specially adapted to supplement deficiency of proteid in the diet. Its density and richness in fat, liow- ever, render it difficult of digestion. This difficulty is best overcome by dissolving the cheese and then mixing it with some cereal food, e.g. macaroni. Solution can easily be brought about by adding to every quarter poimd of the grated cheese as much bicarbonate of potash as will lie on a threepenny piece, and stirring the whole with a little warm water or milk. The absorption of clieese in tiie intestine is fully equal to that of meat. Egos.—An ordinary hen's egg weighs about 2 ounces, of which about 12 per cent consists of shell, 58 per cent of white, and 30 per cent of yolk. The shell consists of carbonate of lime. The white and yolk have the following composition :— WatiT. Proteiil. Fat. Asli. White . . 8.T-7 12-6 0'2.5 0'59 Volk . . 50-9 16-2 31-75 I'Og The white consists of a solution of variotis proteids, the chief of which is egg albumen. Some, at least, of tliese yield a reducing sugar on hydrolysis. The yolk contains a large amomit of emulsified fat and a considerable proportion of lecithin. It contains also other organic compounds of phos- phorus, amongst them a nucleo-proteid and an organic compound of iron. Indeed, yolk of egg is one of the richest food soiirces of iron that we possess. The fact that it contains so much fat and organic phosphorus seems to make yolk of egg of peculiar use to growing animals, and explains its value in the diet of children. Experiments on their digestibility have shown tiiat two lightly-boiled eggs remain in the stomach about If liours. If taken raw they remain rather longer, and raw eggs are not really more digestible than those wiiich have been hglitly cooked. Hard-boiled eggs remain about three hours. The absorption of eggs in the intestine is very conqjlete, only about 5 per cent of residue being left. Hence eggs may be safely ordered in diarrhoea. The nutriti^■c value of one egg is equal to that of al)Out half a tumblerful of milk. The potential energy yielded amounts to 70 Calories. Twenty eggs are required to supply the amount of proteid required daily. Vegetable Foods The vegetable foods are dis- tinguished from animal foods mainly by containing much morecarboli3'drate and consider- ably less proteid. The carbo- hydrate is chieiiy in tlie form of starch, although some vegetable foods, e.r/. fruits, contain sugar instead. The proteids met wixh Ijelong mostly to the globulin class, and contain less carbon and more nitrogen than animal pro- teids, which is said to give them a lower nutritive value. The comparative jjoverty of vegetable foods in proteid renders it difficult to obtain a sufficient supply of nitrogen fi'om them alone unless a large quantity is eaten, and the con- sumption of vegetable foods in quantity is in- convenient owing to their bulk. Tliis bulkiness is due to the fact that most vegetable foods contain much cellulose and much water, for even the dry vegetable foods, e.cj. the cereals and pulses, take up much water in process of l)eing cooked. Hence the pure vegetarian has to choose between living on a minimum of pro- teid or consuming siich a biilk of food as throws a considerable strain on the stomach and bowels. The adoption of the former alternative seems to diminish one's energy, as distinct from muscular sti'ength, and to lower one's power of resistance to disease ; while the latter course is apt to culminate in disorders of digestion. The dis- advantages of a ptu'oly vegetalile diet are in- creased by the inaliility of the intestines to absoi'li large qaiantities of vegetable proteid, as already pointed out, unless presented in very special forms. On the other liand, their com- parative poverty in nitrogen adapts the vegetalile foods for use in chronic renal disease and in gout, while their bulkiness is of value in habitual constipation by stimulating peristalsis, and in obesity by affording a maximum of quantity with a minimum of nutritive material. The vegetable foods may be divided into the following classes :— 1. Cereals. — The composition of tlie nm^t generally used of these is as follows :—

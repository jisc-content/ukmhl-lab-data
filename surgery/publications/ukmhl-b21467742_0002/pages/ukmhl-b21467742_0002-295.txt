CURETTAGE, UTERINE 261 used to be luiich feai-ed, ;uid tul)al disease and perimetritis were formerly regarded as Contra- Indications to curettage ; but the risk has prob- ably been exaggerated, and it is now held by some gynecologists to be good treatment to use the curette in those very conditions which were regarded as contra-indications. Of course under these circumstances the alternatives are vaginal hysterectomy or laparotomy. Pregnancy is a certain contra-indication, save when it is desired for some good reason to induce abortion.

352 DIET based upon estimations of the intake and output of the chief chemical constituents of the food, and of the amount of potential energy expended daily in the production of heat or muscular work. The latter is founded upon a simple analysis of the diets of healthy persons, living under known conditions, and neither increasing nor losing in weight. Dietaries based upon the results yielded by the first method are called standard dietaries; those which result from the second are actual dietaries. (1) The chief chemical elements which the physiological method has to take into considera- tion are nitrogen and carbon. A healthy man, of average weight and doing a moderate amount of muscular work, excretes from 16-20 grammes of nitrogen and about 320 of carbon daily. In other words, he will require every day to be supplied with about | of an ounce of nitrogen, and I lb. of carbon, or one part of the former to every sixteen of the latter. The approximate proportion of carbon to nitrogen in some common articles of diet is as follows :— Roast Beef has 1 of Nitrocren to 5 of Carbon. Eggs Cheese Milk Pease Bread Potatoes have has have has have 7 10 11 12 28 33 Evidently none has nitrogen and carbon in proper proportion. For this reason one must either adopt a mixed diet or consume an undue amount of one or other element. The former alternative is the one usually adopted, and is illustrated by the following standard English diet (Oliver):— Foundation— 1 lb. Bread J ,, Meat . i „ Fat . Accessories— 1 lb. Potatoes 1 pint Milk 2 Eggs . 2 oz. Cheese Carbon. 117 34 84 45 20 15 20 335 Nitrogen. 5-5 7-5 1-3 1-7 2 3 21 Such a diet more than supplies the amount of carbon and nitrogen required. Taking the output of heat and work as the basis of calculation, it is found that a man doing moderate muscular work requires a supply of potential energy equal to 3000-3500 Calories daily. The next question is, what fraction of this total is to be provided in the form of pro- teid, carbohydrate, and fat respectively? As regards proteid the reply is easy. The amount must be suflicient to provide 20 grammes of nitrogen. Now one part of nitrogen is con- tained in 6^ of animal and 6-5'7 of vegetable proteid. Hence 20 x 6"25, i.e. 125 grammes of proteid, will be an ample allowance. The relative proportions of carbohydrate and fat are not so easily determined, for we have no means of knowing how much of the total CO., excreted daily is derived from the oxidation of the one and how much from the other. All we can do is to distribute the balance of Calories not obtained from proteids between the two in accordance, as far as possible, with the results of actual observation of the usual amounts of each consumed by healthy men. As a matter of fact, the data given by different authorities on this point are conflicting, but 105 grammes of fat and 420 of carbohydrates may be re- garded as a fair allowance, erring, if anything, in the direction of an undue preponderance of fat. These amounts will provide a total of 3211 Calories distributed as follows :— Proteids . Fats. Carbohydrates . Calories. 125 grammes X 4"1 = 512'5 105 ,, x 9-3= 976-5 420 X 4-1 = 1722-0 3211-0 Such a diet might be made up as follows (Atwater):— Beef .

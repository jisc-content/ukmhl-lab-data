397 DIPHTHERIA that not only do different l^rotlis vary from one another, but also that the same broth varies from time to time with respect to the relative proportion of its toxic and non-toxic combining powers. The instability of toxin has prevented the production of a standard toxin for general use. Antitoxin, however, is a much more stable body. B}' a series of experiments (which he states can be accurately repeated) Ehrlich be- lieves he has succeeded in eliminating the errors due to the varying constitution of toxin-broth, and has thus been able to obtain an antitoxin of miiform strength. This antitoxin is now used in most laboratories for testing a new serum. It is, firstly, ascertained what quantity of a toxin produced in the usual way is neutralised by one unit of Ehrlich's standard antitoxin. Secondly, it is determined how much of tlic serum, of which the antitoxic A-alue is being tested, will neutralise this ascertained quantity of toxin. The definition of a " unit" is as follows :—" A serum of which 1 c.c. when mixed with 100 times the fatal dose of toxin protects a guinea-pig of about 250 grammes weight from death within four days, contains one unit per c.c." Park points out that in this definition toxin nuist be taken to mean a toxin " liaving the characteristics of toxins in culture at the height of their toxicity." At the present time sera can be obtained which contain as many as 4000 units in 5 to 10 c.c. Before we proceed to discuss the question of the usage of the serum in the human subject we must draw attention to one very important point in the experimental evidence. It has been found that if an interval be allowed to elapse between the injection of the toxin, and subse- quently the antitoxin, into a susceptible animal, then the longer the interval the less effectual will V)e the action of the antitoxin, and, finally, tliere comes an occasion when the interval has been made too long, and the antitoxin is injected too late to prevent the lethal effects of the toxin. Hence it was predicted by Behring that the success of the treatment would be found to depend very largely upon the earliuess of its application. Clinical evidence has amply borne out this prediction. The following figiu'es, illus- trative of this point, are taken from the Statistical Reports of the Metropolitan Asylums Board :— Day of disease u])on wliiolO patient was admitted (1S'.)4) ( or brouglit under antitoxin f treatment (1S95-97) j 1st 2ik1 3rd 4th 5th .and later.

Nearly the whole of these cases are brought under treatment on the first or second day of their illness. Unfortunately a very large proportion of the patients admitted to the Asylums Board Hospitals have been ill longer than three days. What can be done by the early administration of antitoxin amongst even the poorest patients treated in their own homes has been shown by the Department of Health for the City of Chicago. Ill that city prior to the antitoxic periocl the average case-mortality in hosjoital and private practice was about 35 per cent. In October 1895 the Department undertook to supply antitoxin gratuitously to the poor, a medical officer being sent to administer it immediately upon receipt of tlie notification of the case. This action was at once followed by a most extraordinary and gratifying fall in the case-mortality, which was for the period 5th October 1895 to 31st December 1896, 6-57 per cent; for 1897, 6-93; for 1898, 7-33; and for January and February 1899, 6'53. Details of Antitoxin Treatment. — Inas- much as in diphtheria the disease has already got a start of the remedy, the mortality will probably never bo reduced to zero. But the above and other similar figures go to show that if antitoxic serum were employed not later than the second day of the disease the case-mortality would not exceed 10 per cent. Therefore the cardinal rule in the antitoxic treatment is— Inject early. If the treatment is commenced on the first day the dose should be 1500 units at least; it will usually be unnecessary to give more than 2000. But if it be delayed, the amount must be increased up to 8000 or 10,000 units, accord- ing to the severity of the case. It is advisable to repeat from half to the whole first dose within twenty-four hours if the local exudation shows no sign of resolution. With resjiect to the total amount to be administered, though as far as the writer knows (and he has often in- jected from 30,000 to 50,000 units) the limit is set only by the volume of the serum that can with convenience be injected, yet his experience leads him to say that little is to be gained by giving more than 16,000 units during the first twenty-four hours from the commencement of the treatment. But, again, the earlier the treatment is begun, the less necessity will there be for large and repeated doses. As the more concentrated sera are more expensive than the less concentrated, early treatment is more economical. The serum is administered by injection into the subcutaneous tissue of the flank or abdomen. The skin at the seat of injection should be

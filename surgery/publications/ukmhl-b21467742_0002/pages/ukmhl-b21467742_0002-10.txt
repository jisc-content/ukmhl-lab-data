vi EDITORIAL NOTE hundred maladies which are often distinguished by the addition of the nan:ie of the medical man who first described or who specially investigated them, with the briefest of definitions attached to them. Medicine is advancing with such rapidity in these days, and details are nmltiplying so quickly, that it is difficult for any work to keep pace with it and avoid omitting new terms or methods of treatment; but the fact that the present volume contains a description of the Dmmmond-Morison Operation, definitions of Dichotomy, of Delta, of Goviplement, of Cleidotoviy, of Dicestriim, and of Cordcntery, and articles on Cytodiagnosis, Cryoscopy, and DecMm^ination, will show that I liave at any rate striven to fulfil my duties as Editor in, this respect also.

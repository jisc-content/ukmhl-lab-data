Devonshire Colic—Cider (from its acidity) easily atfects lead with which it comes in contact, so lead-poisoning may be produced by drinking cider. This may account for the frequency of plumbism in Devonsiiire. See ToxicoLO(iY {Irritants, Lead).

Dextrin.—A carbohydrate (C,.Hi(,0.), called British gum, closely allied to inidin, obtained from starch by the action of dilute acids, of diastase, and of animal ferments ; it is a polysaccharid, got by the polymerisation of glucose or dextrose (CuHjoO,,); the first dextrins formed by the action of saliva on starch give a brown colour with iodine and are called erythro- dextrins, the next give no colour {achroodextrins). See Physiology, Eood and Digestion {Food, Carhoh ydra tes, Polysi iccharids). Dextrose. — Glucose, grape sugar, or bkiod sugar, the aldehyde of mannite, a simple carbohydrate (CyHj^C )j;), or monosaccharid ; it is so called because it is dextro-rotatory, i.e. rotates the plane of polarised light to the right, and thus differs from Ijevulosc, which it otherwise resembles ; it is one of the aldehyde sugars or aldoses.

Etiology.—Diabetes insipidus is a compara- tively rare condition. During a period of six years twenty cases were under treatment in the wards of the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. Ac- cording to the statistics of Roberts, Strauss, and van der Heijden, the disease is most common during adolescence, early manhood, and middle life. Sex seems to play a not unimportant part as a predisposing factor, males being twice as frequently affected as females. A marked family predisposition may exist, the disease

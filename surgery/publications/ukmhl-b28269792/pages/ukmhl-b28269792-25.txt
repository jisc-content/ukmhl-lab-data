19 urea, the nitrogen of which prevails so abundantly in muscular fibre, and most surely of many other matters. Our immediate object precludes such a digression; but it may be observed that the elucidation of a theoretical principle does not require this of us. It is only necessary to remember that Avhen distinct facts establish a view, a more general observation may restrict, but cannot repu- diate it, may assist to extend and define, but cannot abolish it. These observations seem indispensable, espe- cially for those who are already biassed to a single set of opinions. Every doctrine must stand or fall by itself. Doctrines Avhich are erroneous must clash. Those which are just will fairly coincide, and those Avhich are growing rightly will illustrate and corroborate each other. SECTION B. We may next take up the consideration of the second proposition of our fundamental principle, which relates to disease. When the activity or indolence of an organ passes beyond the salutary bounds already adverted to, this is disease; and we find that unless its functions return speedily to their due proportions, a manifest disturbance arises in other functions, in order, as we may suppose, to adjust the balance of actions, or make a certain approach to that balance, without which the functions successively fail and life ceases. Thus Ave have arrived at a definition of disease—a definition Avhich is indeed genei’al, but which is equally applicable to every kind of morbid process, and one which seems particidaidy available for the objects of our present procedure. We may justly determine that,

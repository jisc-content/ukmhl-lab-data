20 ivlien an organ is excited or impeded in the exercise of its offices beyond the natural degree, it is in a state of disease although such may at first be actually imperceptible. It is for the most part, however, the effect of one or more deranged functions on the system at large, which is so apparent to us and which we agree to call disease. It is scarcely perhaps necessary to observe that the pi’imai’y object of study is disordered function, whether in connexion with or independent of perceptible disorganiza- tions We may avail ourselves of all discoverable morbid appearances in actions, products, or tissues, in order to derive a clear apprehension of a disorder, its nature, degree, and correlative influence ; and this will ensure a right perception of disordered functions, but it must be always indispensable carefully to distinguish between a settled disorganization and a progressing disease. There is no mere refinement of reason in this view : it is only valuable so far as it is practicable, as we may see hereafter. The difference between an incipient ulcer of the cornea and an old opacity is of the same kind as that between a recent changeable stricture and one which is old and permanent. From the first fundamental law already explained, as involving the healthy balance, disturbed yet amenable, more or less, to remedies; and after a general definition of disease, we come to observe that the disturbance may commence in almost any part, and that it may continue very partial. Thus we obtain a division or series of disorders, whether acute or chronic, common or specific, of the least complex kind. Local disturbance then, disorder or disease, seems to me to express cpiite naturally a second laAV (in our Second

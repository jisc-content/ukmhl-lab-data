Mr. King on the Safety-Valve of the Human Heart. 3 quantities; and on the occasions of the most copious influx, the cavity becomes distended; upon which, portions of the tricuspid valve are drawn aside, an aperture of reflux is produced, and the force of the ventricle is diverted from the pulmonary circulation at the moment when the lungs might otherwise be overwhelmed. The exposition of the varied and gradational structures in the right ventricle of the hearts of animals will be subse- quently produced, both as corroborative and in illustration of the fact of a refluent function. In man—who, in a scale of animals arranged according to their share of this function, is not far from holding a middle place—the distention of the right ventricle depends chiefly upon the forces which bring the blood into it; and, accordingly, the nature of these forces will first require consideration. Of the Force of the Venous Current.—The activity of the venous circulation is shewn by the rapid flow of blood in a vein that has been momentarily emptied by compression (as on the back of the hand); and again, by the distensive fulness so readily produced on obstructing the current (as by a ligature on the arm); which effect takes place notwith- standing the elastic resilience of the tubes and the cutaneous pressure—powers which are sufficient instantly to dissipate the congestion when the obstruction is removed, though not always sufficient of themselves to overcome the gravitation of a considerable column of fluid contents. With respect to the motion of the blood in the great systemic veins, Magendie says, “ It is very probable that the blood flows with unequal rapidity in each of them; but what is certain, is, that the three volumes of fluid endeavour to enter the right auricle, and that the efforts thus made are very considerable.” In order to estimate the force of the venous stream, we may consider the jet produced from a punctured vein, whose course has been arrested, as by a ligature, in vene- section ; and at the same time we may observe the increase of the jet when the muscles are set in motion, as an indi- cation of the general influence of muscular exertion. Of the Causes of the Venous Current.—In studying tlie several powers which combine to propel tlie blood through

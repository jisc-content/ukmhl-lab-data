() Mr. King on Disorders which are Variable ; sided, are liable to be renewed. Parts considerably disor- ganized may admit of fresh disturbance and further change; but their acquired states are otherwise generally permanent; at least, there are numberless instances of these kinds; and to these my observations may be restricted. In studying the common traits even of the majority of diseases, the cha- racter which I have endeavoured to establish will continually enforce attention; and most of all, perhaps, in relation to many different chronic diseases; for it will appear, that it is their remarkable and almost constantly distinguishing fea- ture, that they evince a tendency, and often repeated efforts, towards reparation or subsidence, with occasional relapses from temporary deranging causes. Sometimes, as it is said, the disease wears itself out; that is, the restorative efforts gain the ascendancy often by judicious treatment, or merely from the absence of deranging influence, but especially at certain periods of life: and, in truth, so great an effect does age produce, that the cases in question would now and then appear to be restored without the concurrence of other fa- vourable causes: but this is only an appearance, not a reality, as we may hereafter find. As examples of reparative kinds of chronic affections, many ulcers might be adduced; and particularly the erratic (healing on one side, and extending on the other); and also numerous variable painful and dyspeptic disorders. Nothing, I suppose, can be much more certain, than that we every now and then observe some instances of continued derange- ment, or even of disorganization, which, if it do not actually become repaired, presents at least a manifest degree of im- provement ; and, notwithstanding, frequently goes on, to the ultimate destruction of life. Sometimes an extremely similar state proceeds, xminterruptedly, to a fatal conclusion. Oc- casionally, too, we may see the less promising case happily cured; whilst, on the other hand, that which may justly have been deemed favourable, proves,â€™ even in the ablest hands, ultimately destructive. But that almost all cases of the kind alluded to seem to admit of remedy or considerable pallia- tion, at one period or another, is a fact which gives them a particular interest, and claims the utmost attention. In those cases where death occurs, we find it to result

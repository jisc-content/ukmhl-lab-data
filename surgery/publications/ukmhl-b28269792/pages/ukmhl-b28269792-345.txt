IMPERVIOUS urethra; accumulated urinary secretion; dilated ureter; bursting op the distended bladder; peritonitis and ascites at the fourth month of F(ETAL life. Thk rarity of the following case*, the plain and simple pathological explanation of events, and the probable phy- siological inference of fcetal secretion, have led me to consider these particulars as fully worthy of being recorded; and I have been at some pains to render them accurate, though it has not been in my power to make them in all respects complete. Mr. Nathaniel Coats presented to the Museum a fetus, the subject of the present history. Having seen a good deal of practice, he was struck with the unusual appear- ances when the case occurred; and preserved the specimen very carefully, with the view to its being made available in the illustration of disease. The following are the principal particulars, which he related to me from memory, con- I have not found any precisely similar history detailed ; but I would venture to remark, that more general and careful observations of foetal morbid anatomy might explain many of that class of abortions which do not originally depend on the mother. There are some cases which appear cf a doubtful class. Two cases occurred, under my own observation, within a few days, which seemed easily explained. In one, it appeared that the foetus had been expelled at the os uteri, through a little fissure in the ovum, which subsequently came away otherwise entire. The umbilical cord was torn across in the aperture. This, which I believe to be a common event, occurred about the sixth week. In the other case, at about the second month, a simple decollation seemed to have been effected in a similar manner. The head came away perfect; but the remainder was dissolved by decomposition, with much delay, and foetid discharge.

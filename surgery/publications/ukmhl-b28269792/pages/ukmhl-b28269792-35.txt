29 variable diseases fi'om that law (third), which declares the course of disease to be invariable, and always in exact proportion to the cause and constitution, if it shall be shown that variable diseases are equally definite, but depend only on variable causes; that they consist of a succession of diseases,—many repetitions of a disease. The truth of the law, that the course of disease is definite, &c., I suppose to be universal; the truth of the fourth—diseases tend to decline, &c., may possibly be no less so. Both these rules, however, need the illustration which is to be derived from the exposition of the fifth, for which I must premise that it is not intended to explain actual exceptions to the pre- ceding laws, but that it forms in fact a separate though less general rule. Were it not, however, for the sake of the precision afforded by separate consideration, I should have been disposed to state my view of the last three laws col- lectively : thus, various causes and conditions of the frame render the progress of many disorders irregular, and here as well as in uninterrupted recoveries, w'e observe the natural efforts tending to restoration; and in all these cases, and in every accession or repetition of disease, there is a degree of uniformity fixed and certain, with a due regard to the excitants and the recipient, as far at least as our knowledge of causes and constitution can justify any assumption at all. I now for the present take my leave of this subject and of my reader, not without an interest in the comment he may make, although there is but one point on which 1 might wish to reply. If he should ask,, what is the use of

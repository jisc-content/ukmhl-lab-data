The following is an abbreviated account of the opinions formerly advanced, but hitherto unpublished;—and addi- tional facts are likewise adduced. The whole is arranged with especial reference to the Preparations contained in the Museum of the Hospital *. Part I.—OF THE SAFETY-VALVE IN MAN. SECT I.—OP THE CAUSES OF DISTENTION IN THE BIGHT VENTRICLE.

These last form but a very inconsiderable portion of the labours of Mr. Joseph Town; an artist whose ability is only surpassed by his activity; and whose works, already exceedingly numerous, and perhaps of unequalled execution, are incessantly adding to the rarity of the Collection.

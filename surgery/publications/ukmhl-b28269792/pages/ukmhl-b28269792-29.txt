23 In the summer of 1839, I made the acquaintance of Dr. Jennings, senior, a Professor of Medicine in Baltimore, and had the advantage of an exposition from him, which, if I did not fully admit, I did not fail to regard with great interest. This was a view of general pathology, in relation to the nervous system, and as the Doctor was well informed, and both keen and energetic, my impression was, that the hypothesis must often have served him most happily in practice. I certainly think the account deserving of general attention, yet I shall make no pretension to accuracy in the relation (from memory), or in defining its value. The first thing assumed was a given and appropriate quantity of the matter of innervation (nervous fluid or the like), circulating naturally in various parts of the system; and in health pretty equally distributed, but liable, with disease, to perversion or irregular deter- mination. A great degree of importance was attached to the accumulation of the fluid, and to its subsequent local overflow (if I may so express it), as when a person is said to take cold, and the disorder terminates in a catarrh. Fevers were regarded as the effects also of undue accumulations of innervation, and phlegmasinc as the localization of the wandering fire, (if I am not mis- taken.) Much stress was laid upon the apparent fact, that the weakest part is most obnoxious to the inundation. Metastasis w^as thought to depend on the accidental or medical repulsion, and a fresh localization (as of neces- sity) ; and relapses were imputed to still retained accumulations, or renewed causes of retention.

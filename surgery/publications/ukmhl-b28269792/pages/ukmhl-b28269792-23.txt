17 year, the periods of the day, the successions of meals, the processes of the mind, and the motions of the ndll, there is evidence enough that a certain equipoise of the func- tions is the character of health, and that the sanatory fluctuation is at once a natural result of external agency and mutual coriâ€™espondence, and a providential resource to obviate more sudden or serious disturbances; in truth, it is an act of compensation. These principles w'ill be further developed, and their application elucidated by the consideration of diseases of particular organs. The oscillations of the functions and their mutual acts of compensation, duly considered, only serve to explain more fully what may be called theoretically the balance of health; and they may be employed to illustrate the commencement of disease. These natural fluctuations again are continually made available, during the progress of diseases, to obtain a compensatory action, on the part of a healthy organ, which becomes opposed to the too great or too little activity of that which is diseased; as, for example, when one kidney is hastily obstructed, the other becomes hypertrophic. The remedial bearing of these rules is obvious; but we must defer the consideration of this part of the subject. We have remarked upon the balance of health, the natural fluctuations and mutual compensations of the functions, and have introduced partial examples, which, it will be observed, are drawn almost exclusively from the humoral changes produced in the body; but instances might have been found in abundance among the other actions, had not the first named seemed most applicable to the subject before us. All organs, Ijy exercise, obtain an increased circulation and nutrition, and consequently (and in this way) effect a greater consumption or deteri- 2

Mr. T. Wilkimon King on the Stomach. 14 right third only had a coat of mucus, which was loose and rather thick. The fluid contents were feebly acid; and, after repeated washing, the cul-de-sac only reddened litmus. The whole stomach was again well washed, spread out, and sprinkled with cuttings of litmus-paper, and set aside for twenty-four hours. The re-action was only evident to the left of the car- diac oi’ifice. Case 3. Jan. 13, 1842. Maria H., about 35 years of age, fat and intemperate, was found dead. The body was examined six hours from the probable time of her decease. There was much serous effusion in the head. The liver was tumid, and lacerahle. The stomacli contained only about an ounce of mucus, scented with gin, and not acid. The stomach, being washed under the water-cock, and sprinkled with litmus-cuttings, exhibited acid re-action, in the cul-de-sac only, after twenty hours. Case 4. Jan. 15, 1842.—Mary W., aged 23, the subject of old and recent inflammations in the chest. The body was not wasted. The right heart was distended. The liver was tumid, pale, and coarse; the kidneys, plump, and dai’k. The stomach (forty hours after death), when laid open, was a little acid at all parts; but'after very free washing, a little softish patch in the cul-de-sac only reddened litmus slightly. Case 5. Jan. 15, 1842.—William W., aged 44, affected with renal disease, serous effusions, and soft vegetations on the corded valves of the heart. The stomach, fifty hours after death, was contracted, and lined with mucus which was not acid. The stomach, treated as heretofore, gave no sign of acidity in the course of forty-eight hours. Case G. Jan. 24, 1842.—James A., aged 48, suffering from diabetes, was early carried off in a kind of epileptic fit. The body was examined six hours afterwards.

27 hemorrhage to illustrate that of diarrhcea, it is not my intention to speak of a wound as a disease : this is a disorganization. If there is anything about it of the charaeter of disease (as a process), it is the reparative changes which are, however, not morbid, for these tend to decline the moment the local excitement is obviated. These remarks apply to all the morbid changes which surround a settled lesion, an aneurism, a foreign body, or a new growth. The latter is mostly to be regarded just as any other part of the body; sometimes it declines because its stimulus and nutrition fail through other correlating actions, at other times it grows for manifestly opposite reasons. The phthisical patient is perfectly right when he says I am much better this week; and morbid anatomy proves that such cases do recover, as well as that others are repeatedly repairing. He says, I have taken cold again, my expectoration is returned; and he says truly. He has gradually become extremely susceptible of dis- turbance ; the counterbalancing organs have become obstinately inert, and his physician has not learnt to help him rightly. Let us patiently endeavour to find out the full extent of this last law, how nearly it may be universal. Let it not be idly imagined to be visionary because it does not seem universal; how remarkably does it apply to numerous activity in tlic right heart, the lungs, the left heart, and its distribution of blood, with the resulting excretions, &c. Finally, a subsidence of these functions may be traced in a similar order. Thus it may happen in diseases; and thus we see that the restorative actions arc physiological. Ilut we do not see where these actions cease before death occurs.

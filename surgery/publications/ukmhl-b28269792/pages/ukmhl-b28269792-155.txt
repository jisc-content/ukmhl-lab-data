( 15 ) DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATE. Fis. 1. is a View of the Riffht Side of the Beaver’s Heart; the ca- vities being opened. A. . The part of the cavity of the right ventricle, communicating with the pulmonary artery. B. . Part of the wall of the right auricle cut away.—There is a similar opening below it; and the great veins and true auricle are also shewn. C and D. . Muscular columns of the safety-valve connecting the curtain with the yielding wall. A muscular column is seen between C and D; which is based upon the solid internal wall, and can therefore only act on the more fixed curtain by its own muscularity. Fig. 2. Sketch of the Interior of the Hare’s Right Ventricle, sur- rounded by a double line, which indicates sections of the thin or yielding wall of the cavity. ^. . is the largest column of four which are seen connecting the curtain with the solid wall only. The inner under or ‘ fixed’ curtain is not seen. Its tendinous cords have no muscular columns. The column A has a band which slightly connects it with the yielding wall; but all the four columns are like the inter- mediate one in Fig. 2., in being incapable of displacement, as C and D (in Fig. 1.), by distention.

The theory of a safety-valve function in the circulation of man, and of warm-blooded animals generally, is, I think, to be supported by as great a variety and strength of argument as any of the doctrines of physiology. The nature of the evidence has formerly been pretty fully indicated*; and the view then unfolded can scarcely be said to have met with a less favourable reception than was to have been reasonably anticipated: yet it cannot be thought unnecessary to add fresh illustration to so novel a topict. I have persuaded my- self, that the importance of the subject to the naturalist, but more especially to medical men, ought to be more than an excuse for the attempt to extend and illustrate the theory, by every possible source of knowledge directly bearing on the subject. It is perhaps rather to be regretted, that, in the way of pathology, so little has been done to render the exposition practically available. The pathology of the right side of the heart, and of its safety-valve, would be topics * See Hospital Reports, Vol. II. p. 104. +1 have formerly quoted all I know of the expressions which only approach tlie idea of a safety-valve. I do not suppose that Dr. Adams will think it otherwise than just, to say that he has not attempted to demonstrate the existence Of a safety-valve, and that he has not hinted at the arrangements on which regurgita- tion depends. I am not aware that he did any more than express his opinion that there is in the right side of the heart “ a natural provision to allow of a partial reflux into the riglit auriclesaying, it “ was absolutely necessary,” “ as various natural causes must momentarily retard the passage of blood througli the lungs.” I have thought it reasonable to make this remark, in consequence of ob- serving that more appears to be attributed to Dr. Adams than I suppose he has ever laid claim to.

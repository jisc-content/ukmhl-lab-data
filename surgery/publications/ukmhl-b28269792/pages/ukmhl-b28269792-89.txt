35 in the Right Ventricle of the Human Heart. Susan P , aged 23 t examined twenty hours after death. The heart was small, and seemingly wasted. The ven- tricles were, however, firm, and of sufficient thickness, in comparison of the whole : their cavities were of mode- rate size. On injecting, the left valve was strong and perfect: the right appeared to have extensive valve- curtains t yet the injection escaped between them pretty freely. There were two large columns of distention ; each having a rather short bifurcated base, uniting it both to the solid and the yielding wall. This patient was worn out by chronic peritoneal and intestinal disease. As in the foregoing case, I would conclude here, that very little was wanting, to the wide extent of curtains and limited cavity, to effect a true valvular action; and, indeed, a brisk, ventricular systole would probably be propulsive enough, with such a valve. Priscilla W , aged 20: examined five hours after death. The right ventricle was by no means distended ; it was of moderate thickness and capacity. On injection, its valve gave considerable refiux; and with some increase of force, there were two band-like jets, rising two or three inches. On repeating the experiment the following day, the refiux seemed to be somewhat diminished. There was one column of distention, with many cords, and a very limited moderator band. There was a second column of distention, small, and far removed from the solid wall. The left side of the heart, at the time of inspection, was nicely contracted. The chief serious conditions wereâ€”Icterus, and acute hepatitis, terminating with coma. In this case, the most favourable operation of the valve was pretty good: the strength and capacity of the ven- tricle, together with the arrangement of the curtains of distention, seconded this effect; and a subsequent diminution of the ventricle improved it. Had the cavity been in a slate of distention, would it not have been otherwise ? i

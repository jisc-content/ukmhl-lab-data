The outward signs of health are here involved, and with them we have to consider all external Influences, and then the first disturbances of health with their various I’esults. The outward evidences of these last during life enforce attention, and after death the morbid anatomy of the interior assists the explanation. Finally, the mature knowledge of the means of relieving disorders follows out of the knowledge of the functions in health and disease, and the consideration of them in dependence on every external agency, whether morbific or sanative. Is it not in the highest degree plain and satis- factory amongst the laws of remedies, that morbid dis- turbing causes are to be obviated j and that over-acting parts are not to be excited, but the contrary;—that their excess of stimulus is to be removed, and that the inert or the natural may be stimulated in order to relieve them? And again, that natural processes must be left unembarrassed? What is there more than this in me- dicine ? What can render these views clear, but a sound physiology and pathology ? Ihe fundamental principle—the initiatory law (so to speak) of medicine—declares the truths or involves the facts: 1st, That licalth consists in a certain uatiu’al state, and moderated action of the several parts of the animal frame;

18 Mr. T. Wilkinson King on the Stomach. Note.—Since concluding the above, I have examined a review of opinions on the softening of the stomach, by Dr. Henry Imlach, in the 47th Volume of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal (1837). Besides an extensive account of different writers, some additional experiments are related ; and the author favours the conclusion, that the gastricjuice is the agent. M. Louis, he states, has retracted all positive opinion; and it is left to, be inferred, which is indeed very certain, that the digestive actions of the stomach in children, as in the last stomach of the calf (both being for the time car- nivorous), are excessive. The accounts of gastromalachia, and Dr. John Gardner’s opinions of atrophia ablactatorum &c., require this reflection, (See the Transactions of the Medico- Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, Vol. I. 1825.)

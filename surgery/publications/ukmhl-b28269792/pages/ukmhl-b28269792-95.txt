39 DKSCRiPTioN OF PLATE I.—Continued. gular, and to widen the breach. The effect of dilatation—the re- tracted and disturbed curtains, and the widened aperture with a copious reflux—could not possibly be represented in a drawing. C Is the fixed curtain. D 1 The anterior curtain of distention; and, D 2 The posterior. The Diagrams 1, and 2, represent the simple elements of a Safety- Valve. A Is the solid wall of the ventricle. B The yielding wall. C The fixed curtain, and its cords ; represented by a single one, with a mere rudiment of a muscular column for its base. D The column, cord, and curtain of distention. No. 1. shews the appearance of the valve when closing against reflux in the ventricular systole : the edges of the curtains should be- come nicely apposed. No. 2. shews the effect of distention ; the yielding wall carrying out the apparatus of distention by retraction of the column D. Diagram 3. is an outline taken from a transverse section of the heart, about one inch and a half from the apex. It is pretty accurate only as relates to the form of the cavity of the right ventricle, and to its adaptation to the solid wall A. Diagram 5. shews all the essential parts belonging to the Safety Valve in Man. It is a section of the ventricle: shewinsr, A The septum or solid wall. B The right, thin or yielding wall. C The fixed curtain, and its cord (one, instead of many). D, E, & II, The columns of disteiilion. I ; D The. first very long; and connected with F The moderator hand. pj The second, secured to the outer yielding wall. II The third, still more remote from the moderator band, less con- stant in its appearance, and smaller, but connected very much as the preceding. Ihe effect of distention is also seen; the yielding wall having fallen outwards, and produced a retraction of the columns, cords, and nirtains of distention.

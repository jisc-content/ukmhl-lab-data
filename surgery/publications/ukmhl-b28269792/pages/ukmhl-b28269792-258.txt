FRACTURE. 8t tinued motion during their repair, which however, is very rarely defective, but often excessive ; and it is remarkable that the cra- nium, devoid of motion, can scarcely fill up a fissure. The complete circular division of the peri- osteum at a fractured part may well be a cause of non-union, since the persistence of bands uniting the fragments, well placed and duly organized, as well as stretched and irri- tated, can scarcely fail to facilitate, expedite, and increase bony union. Next to the complete division of periosteum, we may regard the absence or deficiency of periosteum as a local cause of non-union of fractures. When the neck of the femur is divided, the head is more or less completely deprived of nutrition and the means of reparation, ac- cording to the age of the individual, the pre- cise site of the line of reparation, and the per- sistence of periosteal bands reaching to the severed head. Here the possibility of bony union is still problematical ; a good ligament- ous union is rare ; a new synovial joint is sometimes formed, but commonly the cavity presents denuded surfaces of bone rubbing together. Fracture of cancellated bone is never re- paired so firmly as that of the solid shafts, and the reasons are various. The bony shell, in the former case, is extremely thin, and its nutrient periosteum is but proportionably supplied, and only proportionably capable of activity. It is true that the columnar tissue within is capable of some repair, but this is always scanty, and most of all after the period of growth has ceased. Cartilaginous surfaces are devoid of perios- teum, or at least of all the active functions of such a membrane ; yet the cartilaginous face of the patella seems to perform an efficient part in the ligamentous reunion which fol- lows transverse fracture of the bone. In the patella, the deficiency of periosteum posteriorly, and the scantiness of solid shell and commensurate periosteum anteriorly, as well as the wide separation and oblique or angular displacement of the fragments, suffi- ciently explain the great rarity * of bony union, when the bone is divided transversely, and the scanty ossification of the part under all disturbing circumstances ; but the peculiar inertness of cancellated bone is here equally remarkable. The ligamentous union, after fracture, of the acromion and coracoid processes of the sca])ula ; and of the neck, and even of the body of the lower jaw, as well as of some other parts, may seem justly attributable to a want ot pro- per contact during the repair ; but still the prevalence of spongy tissue in particular parts should not be disregarded. Both these cir- cumstances, and also the influence of repeated ' See an account of a patella broken transversely, anil reunited by bone, by T. VV. King, in No. xiii. of Ciiiy’s Hospital Reports.

The symptoms of non-union in general ma be said to force themselves ujion the surgeon attention. The history of a fracture and iir treatment, together with the flexibility of th part, and its comparatively useless and feebl condition, will scarcely admit of a miscoi ception.

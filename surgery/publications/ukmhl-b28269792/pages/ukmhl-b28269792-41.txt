In the progress of this endeavour, many difficulties have arisen; and the fear of attempting too much (as well of the imputation) has been before my eyes: but I am encouraged to hope that the reader will at least find his labour somewhat repaid by the varied facts and experiences thus presented in a connected order. I am tempted further to hope that my efforts may concur with the rising tendency and growing wants of Medical Science.

Mr. King on the Safety- Valve in Birds. 72 right side of this heart was become pretty firm, and semi- contracted, or a little more: its valve closed accurately upon injection, but was very easily disturbed. A black diver had been dead four days. Its right ven- tricle was thin, and very loose ; and, upon injecting it, the valve could not be made to close ; the cavity not having contracted in death sufficiently to bring the valve within reach of the solid wall, or within the range of a true valvular action. A swan’s heart was the subject of old cellular adhesions in the pericardium ; but the state of its cavities, while in the body, was not observed. Five or six days after its death, without the slightest appearance of softening, the right ventricle being of rather limited extent, both the pulmo- nary sigmoid, and the crescentic valves, were found to be almost incapable of closing at all. They are still preserved, and are perfectly healthy. On examining the heart of a large cormorant, the right side of which contained a good deal of blood*, the cavity of the ventricle was found rather ca^^acious, and the walls firm. It was easy, by pressing laterally on the exterior of the auriculo-ventricular fissure, whilst the fluid was gently injected, to make the valve close neatly: but with the ven- tricle in a state barely full, the valve was not capable of retaining the fluid. The aperture, under these circum- stances, was not less than one-third of that of the pulmonaiy artery. A large grebe, that had been many days dead, was found, on being opened, to have the right ventricle in a state of semi-contraction. Upon injecting this, the valve might be said to act well, though it did not in any state close perfectly * The bird had been several days dead—perhaps a week ; but it was still in perfectly good condition. It had been shot; but the blood was nowhere extravasated. Tlie injection was performed as on former occasions ; the auricle being partly removed.

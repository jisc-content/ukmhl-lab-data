14 2d, That disease forms a perceptible departure from the healthful state; and 3d, That remedies have a power of modifying the dis- turbance or assisting the restoration. SECTION A. First, we may proceed to reflect a little more at length on the first proposition, that which relates to health. A certain gentleness and regularity of the animal func- tions are the characters of health; and, for the sake of a theoretical illustration, we may venture to admit the idea of a perfect equiponderance of tne whole at a given time. We may suppose that at a certain period the digestive, circulatory, secerning, locomotive, sensitive, and reflecting organs may be observed carrying on their functions with a pretty equable activity. We must remember, however, that the operations are incessantly susceptible of marked and varying oscillations,â€”degrees of exaltation and depres- sion, and even, perhaps, of temporary suspension within the limits of the healthful state. The theory of the natural balance of the animal functions would of course appear most unsatisfactory without a proper attention to the principle of fluctuation, and especially when referring to those almost supplementary actions which seem to be developed at distant inters'^als, as, for example, the gene- rative. And further, the theory requires that we should pointedly include the idea of compensatory actions; that we should indeed be well aware, that the oscillation of some one function towards its extreme of natural activity will be continually found supplying the place of another function, which is fluctuating in an opposite direction;

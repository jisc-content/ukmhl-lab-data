in the Right Ventricle uf the Human Heart. 25 with the yielding wall of the ventricle, constitutes the main peculiarity of arrangement and action in the tricuspid valve ; the great extent, thinness, and feebleness of the yielding wall rendering it liable to the distending influence of venous accumulation in various degrees; the curtains being three, and each one being tethered to that part of the ventricular paries immediately beneath itself (but most extensively to the yielding wall), by the intervention of columns, whose passive effect is to produce a retraction of the curtains in proportion to the distention, and whose active contractions serve, under dilatation, to augment the valvular retraction, or rather to maintain it at its height during the imperfect systole. The number, extent, and power of the columns of distention are therefore of great importance to this function, as well as the natural limited extent of the tricuspid curtains. And further, the orifice itself, depending upon the yielding wall, may admit of some relaxation, and thus assist to produce regurgitation. The anatomical demonstration of all these structural peculiarities is sufficiently easy and plain, and the experi- mental proofs of their necessary effects seem to be equally forcible; whilst the extensive application of the facts appears to be of the highest importance in the physiological and pathological considerations of the circulation. Experiments illustrating the Operation of the Safety-Valve. Taking a human heart from a body dead within about 24 hours, and in which I could discover no material morbid change of form or substance, I proceeded to remove por- tions of the sigmoid or semilunar valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and to fix tubes into these vessels, with a view to inject the ventricles. I next cut away a large part of the auricles, so as widely to expose tlieir communi- cations with tlie ventricles: and now, upon injecting the left ventricle through the aorta, the mitral valve became at once firmly closed, and, as seen through the auricle, pre- sented very much indeed the appearance of a continued suture, with a slight prominence or tense bulging sac on either side. The pressure of the syringe and distention of the ventricle being maintained, nothing escaped. Great force was required to disarrange this state, and produce a

15 and that the healthy preponderance of one action in the system will frequently demand a correlative activity in others, and at another time require the compensating decline of some functions.* The explanation of a compensating office seems indis- pensable when a great function declines, suddenly perhaps, and another is consequently excited and supplies its place; as the secretion of miUc on the contraction of the uterus, which is remarkable in this, that a fresh outlet is esta- blished for the mother, and a different nourishment for the infant. Again, when under circumstances of external cold the cutaneous functions are diminished or suppressed, the activity of internal organs is moderately accelerated, or, vice versa, the copious secretions of the surface lead to diminished eliminations from within. These effects appear for the most part salutary, and often necessary. It must be perfectly evident that some conditions of the system naturally call for great and others for slighter exertions of counterpoising parts; and thus we find a necessity established for very free limits to the salutary oscillations of functions. An abundance of fluid being poured into the stomach and vascular apparatus, is plainly connected with the w'ant of a free circulation and more abundant excretory actions, as by the kidneys. In like * Jâ€™lms, with reference to the diagrcams: 1st. The circulation may be easy and uniform, or excited, and still equal. 2dly. Oscillations may arise in any part, and the eompensating states be set up con- secutively. Tlie pulmonary circulation being impeded, accumulation takes place towards the right heart. A freer respiration relieves this. So repletion in the right heart induces full aeration, and then gra- dually the left heart and general circulation participate in the exalted activity.

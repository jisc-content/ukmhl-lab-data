18 oration of the materials circulated, so that the humoral changes depend on all the organs of the body, though in different degrees. The influence of the nervous system, in this respect, is probably not great, whilst in other points of view its functions are numerous and varied, and their correlation (with each other and with every other) is of the greatest importance, whether we regard them as an isolated series or in connexion with the offices of other parts. When w^e consider that all parts supplied wdth nerves must be the sources of sensation, or the subjects of a stimulus arising in a contrary direction (and perhaps both),—when we regard the influence of the senses and other functions on the mind, and the affections of many functions produced by the mind,—we must admit some notion of a natural mean appropriated (in health) to all these mutually dependent parts. We can perceive some- thing of their necessary fluctuation and compensating influences; and we may understand how it is that an excessive oscillation, whether of decline or acceleration, amounts to disease. We may hereafter find it neither tedious nor difficult to exemplify the mutual dependence of the whole animal functions. In an appropriate place, in relation to indi- vidual diseases, it will be highly serviceable to trace, side by side with selected facts, these fluctuations of action in continued though varied degrees of correspondence. For instance, in a plethoric disorder we should have to examine the forces of the circulation and cerebral system as affecting- each other, and as dependent on digestion, and then to observe the individual or combined influence of all these upon the muscular system, or on the excretory functions: perhaps to find the free exercise of the locomotive .apparatus giving rise to a cojjious elimination from the blood of that

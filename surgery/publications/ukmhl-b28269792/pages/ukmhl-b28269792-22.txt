16 manner the want of food, or delay in the digestive opera- tions, both demands and induces a very material retardation in the circulatoiy and secretory actions; and thus a con- fined diet is, to a certain extent, compensated for by more gradual secerning processes, as v^ell as probably by a more complete digestion. The excessive diet of some persons is a sufficient comment upon the powers by which compensatory action or a salutary balance of the functions is maintained; but I have been led to regard as most striking those instances in which an organ, or a function, is occasionally wanting, whether by primitive deficiency, suspended development, or removal, as where a kidney* is deficient, or a testis, or the thyroid gland (an assimi- lative organ), or as in the amenorrhoea emansionis, or in cases of defective limbs. Periodic functions. With respect to those functions which seem to be repeated after greater or less intervals, and which may almost be regarded as occasional or pe- riodical, I am disposed to make but little distinction. Alternations of rest and action seem to belong to all the animal organs. The actions of the heart and capillary vessels are not perceptibly different in this respect. And although the functions are affected by seasons of the * An absent kidney is scarcely uncommon, and 1 have seen several instances, or rather 1 have found the little cellular rudiment of a kidney with a pelvis, hut imperforate ureter. In these cases the opposite organ has not appeared to me very large or coarse in texture, and more than once the intestinal follicles were seen most peculiarly hypertrophied and elongated. Exccj)ting in the instance of one child, I have only found the single kidney in adults.

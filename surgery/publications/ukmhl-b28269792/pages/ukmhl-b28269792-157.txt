OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIGESTIVE SOLUTION OF THE GESOPHAGUS, AND ON THE DISTINCT PROPERTIES OF THE TVFO ENDS OF THE STOMACH. BY T. WILKINSON KING. / The objects of the following- observations, in addition to those named above, are, to enforce the fact of gastric solution gene- rally, and also to suggest a correction of some opinions which are opposed to the last doctrine. I would hope that a simple view of positive facts will suffice to make good the points alluded to. In bringing forward what I have long taught, it may be some excuse to observe, that I have been stimulated by observing that these views are neglected on the one hand, and unconsciously opposed by errors on the other, amongst most of the authorities that I have examined. I venture to suppose M. Louis to be the chief of those who have erroneously regarded the peculiar softening of the sto- mach as a form of gastritis or disease; and my reasons are given in a few words. I conceive, that, from the time of Hunter, the spontaneous digestion of the stomach after death, in man and animals, has been fully established: and it is evident that M. Louis has taken no pains to shew us in what his cases differ from those of Hunter and his followers; but, on the contrary, it will be easy to shew that, in the cases of all, in the main there are specific signs of the action of a gastric juice. The negative side of a controversy is but poor ground to occupy, unless, perhaps, when it affords a ready opportunity for illustrating positive truths. I shall therefore dwell but briefly on the objections I have to make. In autopsies in London, the effects of digestion on the h

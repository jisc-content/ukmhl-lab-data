But the most interesting and available part of this law consists in this, Fourthly, That there is in most diseases (if not in all) a positive tendency to decline, as it were, an active effort to subside, supposing the morbid excitement removed. The onset of a fever, as the falling of a mountain, may be fatal at once ; and the course of a fever or starvation seems at first without palliation, but the actions of every moment are mingled with efforts tending to restore the healthful balance. And do not the relapses of fevers and inflammations, and of numerous slow, protracted disorders testify abundant efforts towards restoration ? What I have already advanced relative to the condition of health, its correlative functions, fluctuating, compensatory, and balancing operations should render this statement plain and conclusive. The modes or means by which the subsidence is brought about are too intricate and various to explain here; such as the following will, however, not be denied. In a common hemorrhage, the functions almost fail, and with them the forces of the circulation: thus the bleeding orifice is left to contract. It is the same in a simple diarrhoea, the cause being only transitory and not I’epeated.* Although I have employed the instance of * As a I’urtlier illustration, 1 venture to introduce a merely pliy- biological train of events.

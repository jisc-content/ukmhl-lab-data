21 proposition). Patience will, I think, find nothing to precede, and everything appears rationally to follow this arrangement. Watching the rise, studying the causes, and attending the progress of simple derangements (and the more simple the better), will be found in the foremost degree profitable. The existence of complex or combined diseases will require no proof. As we saw the efforts of health to maintain an equiponderance of the functions, and found the compensatory actions liable to become inefficient, so we shall find, that when one function fails by disease, others are likely to become oppressed and overwhelmed, and even many in succession, until the disturbance, if not fatal, becomes general: for beyond the investigation of the complex or combined local affections we shall have to study the most general disturbances of the functions whether fatal or not. Complex diseases will express an ulterior law, and again general diseases another. These divisions of diseases are peculiarly adapted for observation and far from being unnatural, although individual cases will only afford us partial illustrations of the main series.* Complicated and general diseases should come next to be examined, but we must first consider the local a little more at length. * When a poor regimen induces weakness and dilatation of the left heart, we have a comparatively simple disease; but with a consequent accumulation in the pulmonary circulation and defect in tlie general, we see examples of increasing complexity. Where the general circulation terminates in the right heart, a tumour of very simple structure may gradually produce obstruction, (lie. aeration of blood and its general transmission slowly decline, and thus finally some vital organ is oveiiurned.

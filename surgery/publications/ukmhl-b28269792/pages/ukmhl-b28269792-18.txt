The second indispensable attainment is an acquaintance with the rise, progress, and termination of morbid actions. The next all-important knowledge is that of remedial agents. The rational principles or laws of medical science must be formed from these combined elements, based upon these rudiments. The course, however, which I deem most natural and satisfactory to the learner is this : To learn together the form, uses, and disorders of any one part, and of others in succession. If any should object to this plan, my reply would be, let the learner try it, and, unless oppressed by needless impediments, I feel confident he will experience interest, and facility, and success, which the routine of school discipline is too much devoid of.* This however is the plan of the schools, although the pupil does not generally commence it until he is about to leave,â€”and perhaps he never does. But, whether in the wide survey, or in the detailed study, it must ever happen that available medical knowledge is attained in this way, for it is then anatomy leads to johysiology, which is * How satisfactory would it be at once to be introduced to tlie structure of the valve between the cavities of the left heart, a dis- sected series, and one living example of its disorders!

17 in the Right Ventricle of the Human Heart. I am in the possession of many distinct records, written by myself and others, of similarly dilated hearts, which indeed are common enough; and it is certain that, under ordinary circumstances, the derangement of the valve is a necessary consequence of this dilatation: for, in the pro- gress of post-mortem examinations, I have found, in hearts thus dilated, or only greatly distended by the final con- gestion, that, upon injecting the ventricle by the pulmonary artery, the tricuspid curtains, when stretched out, were, under all circumstances, a great deal too small to close the opening. Derivative Power of the Right Ventricle.—Some authors have been perhaps too ready to suppose an inherent deri- vative power as accessory to the circulation of the right side of the heart; and it is necessary that we should inquire how far such an idea is objectionable. In the first place, it is very difficult to imagine a simply muscular sac, of whatever figure, possessing in any con- siderable degree the power of expanding as well as of contracting: and to suppose, further, that the power of exhaustion may operate through flaccid venous tubes, seems still more unreasonable. Again, the foi’mation of the right ventricle appears in- compatible with such a function. With reference to the thickness of the yielding wall of the right ventricle in man— Lobstein estimates it at two lines and a quarter 2^ Cruveilhier under four say, 3^ Bouillaud, the chief authority of the day, at two and a half, 2\ The measurement of Cuvier may be stated at two lines and one-third ol He regards the thickness of the right ventricle, in man and most animals, as about equal to one-third that of the left. The mean thickness of the left ventricle in the human adult is very generally received to be seven lines. The capacity of the cavities of the heart, as appreciable after death, is very uncertain. The right ventricle in many animals, when unaffected by any accumulation from the veins, slowly contracts in dying, until it will scarcely contain a few drops: under other circumstances, we are ccrtai

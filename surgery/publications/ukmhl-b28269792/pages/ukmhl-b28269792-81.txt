27 in the Right Ventricle of the Human Heart. to compress the ventricle, and by the same means to lessen the extent of the valvular aperture. Without this unnatu- ral influence, before the ventricle became full by slowly in- jecting it, the fluid escaped, by regurgitation, into the auricle: indeed, I have seen, on several occasions, in hearts perfectly healthy (setting aside the simple congestive ful- ness of death), that the acting tricuspid valve presented an angular aperture, nearly equal in area to that of the pul- monary artery. I infer, that, in the experiments of which I am now speaking, the right side of the heart had been in most cases somewhat too full of blood, and certainly in no case was it greatly contracted; consequently, the results, and the explanations deduced, are most applicable to the living ventricle, when in a state of undue fulness. Whilst the injection of the right ventricle is slowly pro- ceeding, every thing being arranged to free the cavity from all other extraneous influence, the curtains are seen to ex- tend themselves, and incline towards each other and the plane of the opening; and the reflux continues excessive, until they approach one another, to a certain degree, by the pressure of the fluid accumulating behind them: and often, with the continuance of the injection, the stream attains the form of a band from one to eight inches in height, of greater or smaller size, probably depending upon the degree of actual fulness of the cavity during the last moments of life. Here I may observe, that the action of the larger muscu- lar columns is wanting, the curtains are seen extended well across the opening and almost meeting, and it is not possi- ble to imagine that the columns could do any thing to favour a nicer adaptation; but it is very easy to understand, that if the valves should be accurately adjusted, the contraction of the columns, concurring with and being nearly equal to the systole, would retain the curtains in their true valvular position, and thus compensate for the falling in of the wall, which alone might tend to make the curtains flow back fur- ther than is consistent with their peculiar object: and, on the other hand, if the effects of dilatation prevail, we must see, that while the systole tends to restore the true valve, the accompanying contraction of the columns serves to

in the Right Ventricle of the Human Heart. 29 in this case there was some refluent stream. In the second case, however, under precisely similar circumstances, I ob- tained, at last, an almost perfect valvular action: though even this could not be maintained for half a minute without re- nevving the injection, as it continually gave out a little stream, which did not exceed that of the least accurate ad- justment of some one or two mitral valves on which I have experimented, regarding them as healthy. This, to me, was an unprecedented instance of true val- vular action in the right side of the human heart; though so feeble was it, that the slightest pressure of the finger was sufficient to displace the curtains. Although I believe what has been described to be strictly true, I am inclined to suppose that, at a certain point of the natural ventricular systole, the action of the tricuspid valve is very nearly complete. On the other hand, I am convinced that, in all cases in which the right ventricle is, in any ma- terial degree, temporarily distended or permanently dilated, the heart and lungs are relieved by a considerable reflux of the ventricleâ€™s contents into the auricle and systemic veins. It is highly deserving of notice, also, that the more accurate closure of the mitral valve seems to have a like necessary reference to the safety of the lungs; the least backward cur- rent in the pulmonary veins being strictly obviated. A very limited acquaintance with disease must set aside all uncertainty with regard to the fatal mischiefs which follow the imperfect operation of the mitral valve. I have ventured to regard the apparatus, which regulates the right auriculo-ventricular aperture of the heart, as a safety-valve, rather than a simple valve; or more properly, as both the one and the other, on diflPerent occasions. Of course, it is impossible to estimate the precise relation and quanti- ties of these two different functions. It may be imagined that the real proportion of reflux is exaggerated in the preceding exposition; and it must certainly vary much in different human hearts, according to their state of contrac- tion, and still more in the hearts of different species of animals ; but whereas a few simple examinations and expe- riments will suffice to establish the conviction of the physio- logist for or against the principle of a safety-valve action, K 2

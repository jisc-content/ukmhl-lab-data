in the Right Ventricle of the Human Heart. 15 External Pressure acting on the Heart.—There are nume- rous cases of disease in which the surface of the heart is in a state of compression from the fulness of the chest; but, not- withstanding, the right auricle and ventricle are found full, evidently in consequence of accumulation from the veins; whilst the lungs and pulmonary artery have been suffering from obstruction; which has been, in fact, the fatal disease. Hypertrophy of the Right Ventricle.— Even the common morbid increase of muscularity in the right ventricle indi- cates a delay within *; for we know nothing of the simple enlargement of a muscle without some additional excite- ment in the way of difficulty or exercise ; and this hyper- trophic affection is constantly, found in connection with obstructions of the pulmonary circulation, and pretty con- stantly with some permanent distention of the thickened cavity, as well as frequently with a dilated pulmonary artery. Distention.—The fulness of the right ventricle in death, in spite of its tonic contraction, seems very remarkable; and the more so, if we consider that the cavity contracts with great rigidity, when relieved from the internal dis- tending force, within a moderate time after apparent death. Dilatation.—The fact, that the morbid dilatation of the right ventricle is not unfrequent, may serve to prove that the cavity is subject to a certain internal expanding force, at least, in a state of disease—a force that cannot be sup- posed slight, when it is observed to operate effectually against the natural contractile power, and often against a very con- siderable increase of substance and power in the muscular sac. The dilated and hypertrophic right ventricle is con- tinually found in death fully distended with blood; and I am inclined to think that this dilated ventricle is dimi- nished in some degree after death, by the tonic contraction common to all muscles. It seems reasonable to infer, that in the natural states of the circulation, some degree of dis- tention is of much more common occurrence. The Pulmonary Circulation powerful.—The strength of the right ventricle, and of the pulmonary artery and veins, indi- cates a circulation of considerable force; and although tlie * Iiixternal impediments to tlie systole, us from udhesions, are less common.

PUBLISHED DUIIING THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. BY T. WILKINSON KING, F.R.C.S., England. S.S.M.C., Neo-Ebor. RELATING TO VARIOUS POINTS OP PHYSIOLOGY, MEDICINE, AND SURGERY, PHYSICAL, HUMORAL, AND NERVOUS AGENCIES IN HEALTH AND DISEASE, AND REMEDIES. Next to the better and rarer sort of treatises, no contributions to medicine are so desirable as clear digests of the scattered views with which the profession abounds and is almost ready to be overwhelmed. It is essential that these analyses should appear under some responsible name. I regard it rather as a matter of casualty that I am the first to appear in the present style instead of the more weary egotism of eight hundred pages; being convinced how self-evident it will be that the interests of useful writers and careful inquirers are equally concerned in the general adoption of such a method. The public is the judge of truthfulness, and posterity the arbiter of originality. Contents:—A. Of General Principles—Etiology, Therapia. B. Nerve-functions, Disorders — Sympathy. C. Circulatory— Heart, Artery, Aneurism, Vein, Lymphatics. D. Respiratory. E. Assimilations, Thyroid Gland, Cancer, &c. F. Digestion, &c. G. Hernia, &c.—Umbilicus. H. Strictures, &c.—Prostate. I. Ossifications, &c. K. Tension, Tendon, Glandulee Pacchioni, &c. OP GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 1. The prime doctrine of medicine appears to be, that health consists in a certain balance of the functions; and, that beyond their salutary oscillations, periodic changes, and mutual correla- tions and compensations, disturbance arises; first in one organ or element, then in another. 2. Diseases have a very definite course, and mostly tend to spontaneous recovery—which judgment aids or error perverts. (Vide First General Laws, &c. London : Churchill, 1840.) 3. Chronic inflammation is acute disease varying (P). 4. The unsteady course of many affections depends on relapse

SERJEANT-STJKGEON TO THE QUEEN, CORRESPONDING MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRAl^CE, THIS WORK IS DEDICATED IX ADJURATION OF HIS GEEAT TALENTS AND IN REMBMBnANCE OF MANY ACTS OF KINDNESS SHOWN TO THE AUTHOR rnoM AN EARLY PERIOD OF HfS PROFESSIONAL CAREER.PREFACE THE TO SEVENTH EDITION. npmS EDITION hfis received a most careful revision botli of the text and of the sections on Visceral Anatomy. In the former department of the work the Editor has to acknowledge the very vahiable assistance received from his friend, Professor Darling-, of New York University, who has been so kind as to commimicate to him all the verbal and other errors which he has noted in the course of several years during which he has used ' Gray's Anatomy' as the text-book for his class. For other assistance the Editor is indebted to his former pupil, Mr. E, J. Spitta, late Demonstrator of Anatomy at the School of St. George's Hospital, by whom the section on the Ana- tomy of the Kidney in the present edition has been entirely re-written. The illustrations which have been incorporated in this edition from the ' Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory ' are from original drawings by Dr. Kleix. 18 Great CiainERLAXD Place: Dcceniher 1874,PEEFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. THIS WORK is intended to furnish tlie Student and Practitioner with an accurate view of the Anatomy of the Human Bod}^, and more especially the application of this Science to Practical Surgery. One of the chief objects of the Author has been, to induce the Student to apply his anatomical knowledge to the more practical points in Surgery, by introducing, in small type, under each subdivision of the work, such observations as show the necessity of an accurate knowledge of the part under examination. Osteology. Much time .and care have been devoted to this part of the work, the basis of anatomical knowledge. It contains a concise descrip- tion of the anatomy of the bones, illustrated by numerous accurately- lettered engravings showing the various markings and processes on each bone. The attachments of each muscle are shown in dotted lines (after the plan recently adopted by Mr. Holden), copied from recent dissections. The articulations of each bone are shown on a new plan; and a method has been adopted, by which the hitherto complicated account of the development of the bones is made more simple. The Articulations. In this section, the various structures forming the joint are described; a classification of the joints is given; and the anatomy of each carefully described: abundantly illustrated by engravings, all of which are taken from, or corrected by, recent dissections. The Muscles and Fasciae. In this section, the muscles are described in groups, as in ordinary anatomical works. A series of illustrations, show- ing the lines of incision necessary in the dissection of the muscles in each region, are introduced, and the muscles are shown in fifty-eight'engravings. The Surgical Anatomy of the muscles in connection with fractured, of the tendons or muscles divided in operations, is also described and illustrated. The Arteries. The course, relations, and Surgical Anatomy of each artery are' described in this section, together with the anatomy of theX PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. regions containing the arteries more especially involved in surgical opera- tions. This part of the work is illustrated by twenty-eight engravings. The Veins are described as in ordinary anatomical works; and illus- trated by a series-of engravings, showing those in each region. The veins of the spine are described and illustrated from the well-known work of Breschet. The LymphcUics are described, and figured in a series of illustrations copied from the elaborate work of Mascagni. The Nervous System and Organs of Sense. A concise and accurate de- scription of this important part of anatomy has been given, illustrated by sixty-six engravings, showing the spinal cord and its membranes; the anatomy of the brain, in a series of sectional views; the origin, course, and distribution of the cranial, spinal, and sympathetic nerves; and the anatomj'- of the organs of sense. The Viscera. A detailed description of this essential part of anatomy has been given, illustrated by fifty-five large, accurately-lettered engravings. Regional Anatomy. The anatomy of the perineum, of the ischio-rectal region, and of femoral and inguinal hernias, is described at the end of the work; the region of the neck, the axilla, the bend of the elbow, Scarpa's triangle, and the popliteal space, in the section on the arteries; the laryngo-tracheal region, with the anatomy of the trachea and larynx. The regions are illustrated by many engravings. Microscopical Anatomy. A brief account of the microscopical anatomy of some of the tissues, and of the various organs, has also been introduced. The Anthor gratefully acknowledges the great services he has derived in the execution of this work, from the assistance of his friend, Dr. H. Y. Carter, late Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. George's Hospital. All the drawings from which the engravings were made, were executed by him. In the majority of cases, they have been copied from, or corrected by, recent dissections made jointly by the Author and Dr. Carter. The Author has also to thank his friend, Mr. T. Holmes, for the able assistance afiPorded him in correcting the proof-sheets in their passage through the press. The engravings have been executed by Messrs. Butterworth and Heath; and the Author cannot omit thanking these gentlemen for the great care and fidelity displayed in their execution.

There are other fluids also which partially subserve the same purpose, as the saliva, the gastric juice, the bile, the intestinal secretion; and others which are purely excrementitious, as the urine. All these fluids form a part of the bulk of the body under ordinary cii-cumstances. But thei'e is no need to describe the rest in this place, since they are the secretions of special organs, and are described, as far as is judged necessary for the purpose of this work, in subsequent pages. We shall here speak first of the blood, and next of the lymph and chyle. THE BLOOD. The blood is a fluid holding a large number of minute cells or corpuscles in suspension. Its general physical characters are so well known that we need merely say that it is of a dark red or purple colour in the veins, and of a bright red or scarlet in the arteries; that it is viscid, drying rapidly, and with a clammy feeling; salt to the taste, slightly alkaline, and with a specific gravity of about 1055. General Composition of the Blood.—On standing, blood, under ordinary circumstances, soon separates into two parts—a fluid called the ' serum,* and a clot or ' coagulum.' The latter is not merely the cells or blood- corpuscles spoken of above as held in suspension, and which have subsided out of the fluid, but consists besides of fibrin which has been held in solution in the fluid blood, and which in its solidification has enclosed and implicated the blood-corpuscles as they subside. The blood is thus seen to consist naturally of two parts, the plasma, or Uqiior sanguinis, a fluid rich in fibrin, and the blood-cells, or blood- corpuscles ; and when drawn from the body, of two parts composed dif- ferently to the above,—viz. the clot, which comprises the blood-corpuscles and the fibrin of the plasma; and the serum, which consists of the remainder of the plasma. The Mood-corpuscles, Uood-discs, or Mood-globules, as they are more com- monly called, are of two kinds, the red and the white. The red globules are far the more numerous, and are those which are always intended when the expression blood-discs or blood-globules is used without any other qualification. They are said to be in man about three or four hundred times as numerous as the white (Harley); by others only fifty times asxxxviii GENERAL ANATOMY. numerous (Todd and Bowman).* They differ very much in size and shape in different animals. In man their size varies considerably, even in the same drop of blood, between the limits of -j-qVo -jsVo of an inch in diameter, the average being about -jy Q-g- (Todd and Bowman). They are circular discs, bi-concave in ^^'^g-1.—Human blood-glo- profile, having a slight central depression, with a raised border (as seen in Fig. I. h). Their colour appears of a faint yellow when they are seen singly, but it is to their aggregation that the blood owes its red hue. Human blood-discs pre- sent no ti-ace of a nucleus. When the blood is circulating, under the microscope, in one of the lower animals, the blood-globules are seen to be separate from each other, and are also separated from the wall of the vessel by an interval or ' lumen.' Doubtless the same is the case in the human body; but when drawn and examined on a slide without reagents, the blood-globules often collect into heaps like rouleaux of coin (Fig. I. c). Their shape is very soon influenced by the medium in which they are placed, and by the specific gravity of that medium. In water they swell up, lose their colour, and cease to be visible, leaving the white corpuscles in the field. Solutions of salt or sugar, denser than the sermn, give them a stellate appearance; and the usual shape may be restored by diluting the solution to the proper point. A solution of the proper strength merely separates the blood-globules mechanically, without changing their shape. There can be no doubt that the difference in colour between arterial and venous blood must be due to some minute difference in the red blood- globules ; and it is also in the highest degree probable that the chemical differences between these two kinds of blood are due, in part at least, to such diffei-ences; but the change has not hitherto been rendered per- ceptible either to the microscope or to chemical analysis. At the same time, the researches of Professor Stokes f show that the colouring matter of the blood produces different effects on the solar spectrum, according as it is in a more or less oxidised condition ; and it is in the highest degree probable that the same change in the oxidation of the contents of the blood-globules produces the difference of colour between arterial and venous blood. The human white corpuscles axe rather larger than the red, and have an irregular or granular surface. A nucleus becomes perceptible on the addition of acetic acid. They are very similar, if not identical, with the corpuscles of the lymph and chyle, though somewhat more act^d upon by acetic acid than the latter. Their proportion appears to vary con- • Hh-fc puts the proportion as low as 1:1761 during fasting, and 1:695 or 1:429 after food (Kolliker), Venajsection, by withdrawing so much hirger a proportion of tlie red globules, and also by favouring the absorption of lymphatic fluid into the blood, much mcreases the relative proportion of the white corpuscles, so that KoUiker asserts that in the horse, after enormous vensesection (up to 50 lbs.) the coloured and colourless corpuscles appear equally numerous. t Proceedings of Royal Society, 1864.

The colourless corpuscles bear a strong resemblance also to the cells found in pus. From the fact that cells exactly like the colourless corpuscles are being constantly furnished to the blood by the ducts of the lymphatic glands, the chyle-ducts (and even the liver in the foetus), and also from their "Fig. II.—a, White corpuscles of liuman blood; d, Eed corpuscles. High power. o ^^^^ Q ^^^^ varying proportion in different parts of the circulation, and in different pathological conditions, the colourless corpuscles are usually regarded, —with, at any rate, considerable probability,—a.s an earlier stage of the coloured blood-discs. Fat-granules are seen in the blood of the lower animals, and occasionally in the blood of pregnant women; also, according to Kolliker, in other persons after the abundant use of milk or brandy, as well as in those who are fastmg; which he attributes, in the latter case, to the absorption of the fat of the body. But, under ordinary circumstances, the granular base of the chyle, poured into the blood, through the veins at the root of the neck, disappears as the blood passes through the lungs. The fluid part of the blood, the liquor sanguinis, or plasma, is again composed of a permanently fluid portion—the serum —and of fibrin, which coagulates spontaneously when out of the body, but which is held in solution during life. The fibrin can be separated from blood after it has been drawn by whipping it with twigs, to which the fibrin as it coagulates adheres. The liquor sanguinis may be obtained free from the red corpuscles ' by mixing fresh-drawn blood with six or eight times its bulk of serum, allowing the red particles to subside, and then decanting the supernatant fluid and filtering it through blotting paper' (Professor A. Buchanan, quoted by Dr. Sharpey). By this process, or by removing a portion of the clear liquor which is found above the buffy coat of in- flammatory blood just after the latter has formed, the plasma may be obtained (but diluted in the former method), and will then separate by coagulation mto a colourless clot of fibrin and a saline fluid. The fibrin- clot consists of mterlacing structureless strings, which contain in their meshes some white corpuscles accidentally enclosed in them. The ofiice and uses of the fibrin, as well as its real nature, whether it exists as such in the living blood, or ig a product of the death of that fluid, have been and are the subjects of much difference of opinion-but such questions are exclusively within the domain of physiology. The fluid left after the coagulation of the fibrin, which is the serum of(IKNRRAL ANATOMY. xl the blood properly so called, is yellowish, and contains so much albumen that it solidifies almost completely on being heated. It is alkaline from the presence of free soda and carbonate of soda. The chemical composition of the blood is complex, as might be anticipated of a fluid from which all the various tissues of the body are to be formed; and it must of coui-se vai-y in various parts of the circulation. The following seems to be as accurate an analysis as possible. It is quoted in the last edition of Fig', nr.—Blood-crystala.

Tliey are of three kinds :—i. Htcmatin crystals, found in iiormal blood, particularly in the spleen. These are procured by the addition of a little water, or by agitating the blood with ether, by either of which means the blood-corpuscles are ruptured, and their contents crystallise on evapo- ration. 2. HfBinatoidin crystals, found in old clots. 3- Hffimin crystals, formed by mixing dried blood with an equal quantity of common salt and boiling it with a few drops of glacial acetic acid till the whole has dissolved. A drop of the mixture placed on the slide will show the crystals on cooling. Fig. III. shows these three forms of crystals from human blood together with some from the lower animals, for comparison. The importance of being acquainted with the crystals found in human blood is obvious, and more particularly those which can be obtained from dried blood; since in this way old blood-stains can be recognised as being human or otherwise, even long after their formation. The spectrum analysis, however, is said to be a more delicate test of fresh blood. LYMPH AND CHYLE. The lymph and the chyle are almost identical in constitution, though the proportion of their constituents varies in different parts of the vascular system. The lymph is the secretion of a system of vessels and glands, to be more fully described in the sequel, which takes up from the worn- out tissues that which is still available for purposes of nutrition and returns it into the veins close to the heart, there to be mixed with the mass of the blood. The chyle is a fluid secreted by the villi of the small intestines from the food. It is intermingled with the lymph, and is poured into the circulation through the same channels.* See the description of the Thoracic Duct, Lacteals, and Ductus Lymphaticus dexter, in the body of the work. On microscopical examination, chyle displays besides the lymph-cor- puscles a large number of fatty granules, ' the granular base of the chyle,' (Fig. rV. a) oil globules, free nuclei and a few red blood-globules. The white colour of the chyle is due to the abun- Fig. IV.-Chyle from the lacteals. d^nce of the molecular base. These mole- cules are almost or entirely absent in lymph. In other respects lymph and chyle are indistinguishable by microscopic examina- tion, but in external appearance they are very different. Chyle is a milk-white fluid, which coagu- lates spontaneously, and then on standing- separates more or less completely into a clear part, the liquor cliyli, which is identical ^pij^ "with the liquor sanguinis, and a thinnisli jelly-like clot, consisting of fibrin in which chyle-corpuscles and the fatty molecules are entangled. Its analysis, as given by Dr. G. 0. Rees f from the chyle onnl^*" "ify not be amiss to remind the student that the lacteal or chyliferous vessels only o?W -lin , nutntious matter from the food, and this only during digestion. At other times they seem to act precisely as ordinary lymphatics. T Phil. Trans. 1842, p. 82.

In the lymph the molecular base is absent, and the lymph-corpuscles are very few in number, and indeed are said by Kolliker to be absent in the smaller vessels. According to the same author, the size of the lymph-irlobules increases as the fluid ascends higher in the course of the circulation. In this view the lymph is at first a mere albuminous fluid, and the chyle at first a mere albumino-fatty fluid, the cells iia both being pro- duced during the passage of the fluid through the glands (lymphatic or mesenteric, as the case may be), and being further elaborated, and even new cells produced by the division of the old ones, in the course of the circulation. The presence of blood-globules in the lymph or in the chyle is regarded by most authors as accidental, i.e. produced by the manipula- tions of the dissector. The lymph-corpuscles, as seen in the above figure, are in all essential respects the same in the chyle, the lymph, and the blood, where they have been described above as the colourless blood-corpuscles. In the chyle and lymph, however, they vary very much in size. In some cases several younger cells have been enclosed in the original corpuscles. CELLULAR AND FIBROUS TISSUE. The cellular or areolar tissue is so called because its meshes are easily distended, and thus separated into ceUs or spaces which all open freely into each other, and are consequently easily blown up with air, or per- meated by fluid, when injected into any part of the tissue. Such spaces, however, do not exist in the natural condition of the body, but the whole tissue forms one unbroken membrane composed of a num- ber of interlacing fibres, variously superimposed. Hence the old term ' the cellular membrane' is in many parts of the body more appropriate than its more modern equivalents. The chief use of the cellular tissue is to bind parts together; while by the laxity of its fibres and the permeability of its areolse it allows them to move on each other, and affords a ready exit for inflammatory and other effused fluids. It is con- sequently often denominated connective tissue, and this term is still more appropriate to the fibrous tissue which forms the bond of connection between the intimate elements of solid organs ; in which more restricted sense the term is often used in modern works. The areolar tissue consists essentially of two forms of fibrous tissue, the ivhite and yelloiv, intermixed in varying proportions, together with a great quantity of capillary vessels, nerves and lymphatics, and in most situations it contains fiit. The cellular tissue is .continuous over the whole body; so that fluid, and especially a ir,xliii FIBROUS TISSUE. wlieu injected forcibly into it—as from a wound of the lung- or bowel—may be diffused into the remotest parts. The ivhite fibrous tissue (Fig. V.) consists of bundles of wavy fibres, inter- lacing- with each other, each composed of minute filaments, or fibrillar, which appear homogeneous, and measure from 3-0^0-0 sTooo an inch in diameter. The larger fibres have no definite size, but are supposed to Pio; V.—White fibrous tissue. High power. be solid masses formed by an agglutination as it were of the ultimate fibrillEe. Acted upon by acetic acid, the white fibrous tissue swells up into an indistinct uniform mass, which gradually becomes indistinguishable; and thus in the areolar tissue the yellow elastic element comes alone into view. The i/eZZow; elastic fibrous tissue (Fig. VI.) is an aggregation of fibres, which are considerably larger in size than the fibrillai of the white fibrous element, varying from to of an inch in diameter (Harley). The fibres branch and anastomose freely with one another. They are homogeneous in appearance, with dark borders, and are usually seen curled up at their broken ends. They remain unaltered by acetic acid. Each of these elements of the connective tissue is developed from cells. KoUiker describes the yellow elastic fibres as developed from the stellate branching corpuscles, which may sometimes be found free in the areolar tissue, and which Virchow has denominated' connective-tissue-corpuscles ' (Fig. VII.); while the white fibrous tissue is formed from the coalescence oi fusiform cells, which elongate into fibrillse as shown by Fig. VIII. The two tissues just described are very widely distributecTin the body especially the white fibrous tissue. This latter forms nearly the whole of all the firm mvesting membranes; viz. the muscular fascia, the periosteum he investments of the various glands (such as the tunica albuginea testis,' the capsule of the kidney, &c.), the investing sheath of the nerves (neurit lemma), and of various organs, as the penis and the eye (sheath of the corpora cavernosa and spongiosum, sclerotic and choroid . Into all these parts, however, the elastic tissue enters in greater or less proportion. The tendons and most of the ligaments are also formed almost entirely of the white fibrous tissue, but with some elastic fibres intermixed.

The organs which are formed almost exclusively of the yellow elastic tissue are the ligamenta subflava of the vertebrae, the elastic ligaments of the larynx, the longitudinal elastic fibres of the tz-achea, the elastic layer of the middle coat of the ai'teries, and in quadrupeds the ligamentum nuchfB.

EecMingshausen's discovery in the cellular tissue of cold- blooded animals of ' wandering cells,' or cells endowed with the power of automatic motion, and of changing their shape. These cells appear identical with the white globules of the blood; and it would seem from the researches of Strieker, Cohnheim, and others, that the wall of the capillary vessels are permeable to the latter bodies, which are thus allowed to escape into the cellular tissue, there to undergo development, normally into the natural cells and cellular tissue, or abnormally into the corpuscular forms of lymph and pus, according to circumstances.* * On this subject reference may be made to v.

PIGMENT. ADIPOSE TISSUE. The common cellular membrane contains a variable quantity of adipose tissue. This tissue is found also in various parts of the viscera—as the mesentery, the surface of the heart, &c., and fat enters largely into the formation of the marrow of the bones. There is, however, a difference which should be attended to between mere fat and adipose tissue. Adipose tissue consists of a number of vesicles formed by an extremely delicate structureless membrane, round or spherical where they have not been subject to pressure; otherwise, variously flattened. • They are sup- plied and held together by capillary blood-vessels, and fine connective tissue, and each vesicle is filled with fat. Fig. IX.—Adipose tissue, a. Starlike appearance, froiu crystallitiation of fatty acids. High power. Fat is an unorganised substance, consisting of liquid oily matter (glycerine) in combination with certain fatty acids, stearic, margaric, and elaic. Sometimes the acids separate spontaneously before the fat is examined, and are seen under the microscope in a crystalline form, as in the figure. By boiling the tissue in ether or strong alcohol, the fat may be extracted from the vesicle, which is then seen empty and shrunken. Besides the fuUy-formed fat-cells above described, others may occa- sionally be found in the course of formation, especially in cases of sudden death during robust health. They are described by Rollett aa, in the first stage, small round granular cells, provided with a roundish nucleus, into the interior of which a strongly-refracting drop of fat is then secreted, which is at first surrounded by a ring of the granular matter, and gradually increases so as to fill the cell. As the granular matter becomes less and less, the nucleus, which can at first be easily recognised, becomes less perceptible, but according to this author can always be brought into view by appropriate reagents. Fat is said to be first detected in the human embryo about the fourteenth week. ^ In various parts of the body jn.7mer(i is found, viz. in the hairs, in the ins and choroid coat of the eye, in the lungs, in the nerve^cells, in the rotexlvi GENERAL ANATOMY. mucosuni in the dark races, and in some parts of the body—such as the areola of the nipple. Snch parts are of dark colour even in the fair races, except Albiuoes, in whom pigment is absent. Pigment-cells are also found in the blood, according to Virchow. In many situations the colour is produced simply by the presence of dark granules scattered about without any definite arrangement; in the choroid coat the pigment forms a regular layer of hexagonal nucleated cells filled with pigment granules ; in other parts the pigment is contained in branch- ing cells, probably the connective-tissue-corpuscles filled with pigment gTanules ; and in most situations, such as the nerve-cells and the epidermis, the pigment-granules form a greater or less element in the contents of the nuclea.ted cells of the part. (Fig. XXIV.) In the dark races the colour of the skizi is due to the accumulation of pigment in the deeper layers of the epidermis—the rete mucosum. CAETILAGE. Cartilage is a non-vascular structure which is found in various parts of the body—in adult life chiefly in the joints, in the parietes of the thorax, and in various tubes, such as the air-passages, nostrils, and ear, which are to be kept permanently open. In the foetus at an early period the greater part of the skeleton is cartilaginous. As this cartilage is afterwards re- placed by bone, it is called temporary, in opposition to that which remains unossified during the whole of life, and which is called permanent. Cartilage is divided according to its minute anatomy into true or hyaline cartilage, fibrous, or fibro-cartilage, and yellow, or elastic, or reticular cartilage. The various cartilages in the body are also classified according to their function and position, into articiilar, interarticular, costal and menibraniform. True cartilage, which may be taken as the type of this tissue, consists of a gristly mass, of a pearly bluish colour, enveloj)ed in a fibrous mem- Fig. X.—Humran cartilage cells, from the cricoid cartilage.

Its intimate structure is very simple. If a thin slice be examined under the microscope, it will be found to consist of cells of a rounded or angular shape, with nucleus and nucleolus, lying in groups, sur- rounded by a granular or almost homogeneous matrix. By boiling the cartilage for some hours, and treating it with acetic acid, the cell-mem- brane which lines the cavity in the matrix may be made visible.xlvii CARTILAGE. The matrix is often arranged in the form of a concentric ring around the cartilage-cell, forming what is described by some authors as the cartilage-capsule. The articular cartilages, the temporary cartilages, and the costal car- tilages, are all of the hyaline variety. They present minute differences in the size and shape of their cells, and in the arrangement of the matrix. In the articular cartilages, which show no tendency to ossification, the matrix is finely granular under a high power; the cells and nuclei are small, and are disposed parallel to the surface in the superficial part, while nearer to the bone they become vertical. Articular cartilages have a tendency to split in a vertical direction, probably from some peculiarity in the intimate structure, or arrangement of the component parts, of the matrix. In disease this tendency to a fibrous splitting becomes very manifest. Articular cartilage in the adult is not covered by perichondrium, at least on its free surface, where it is exposed to friction, though an epithelial layer can be traced in the foetus over the whole surface of the cartilage, and in the adult over a small part of its circumference, continuous with the epithelium of the synovial membrane. This is probably the remains of an investing membrane which is worn away in after-life by the action of the joint. Articular cartilage forms a thin incrustation upon the joint- surfaces of the bones, and its elasticity enables it to break the force of any concussion, whilst its smoothness affords ease and freedom of move- ment. It varies in thickness according to the shape of the bone on which it lies; where this is convex, the cartilage is thickest over the convexity where the greatest pressure is received, and the reverse is the case in the concavities of the joints. Articular cartilage appears to imbibe its nutri- ment partly from the vessels of the neighbouring synovial membrane, partly from those of the bone upon which it is implanted. Mr. Toynbee. has shown that the minute vessels of the cancellous tissue, as they approach ■tlie articular lamella, dilate, and.

In the costal cartilages the cells and nuclei are large, and the matrix has a tendency to fibrous striation, especially in old age. These carti- lages also are very prone to ossify. In the thickest parts of the costal cartilages a few large vascular channels may be detected. This appears at first sight an exception to the statement that cartilage is a non-vascular tissue, but it is not so really, for the vessels give no branches to the cartilage-substance itself, and the channels may rather the perichondrium. The ensiformGENERAL ANATOMY. xlviii cai'tilage may be regarded as one of the costal cartilages, and the cartilage of the nose and of the larynx and trachea resemble them in microscopical characters, except the epiglottis and cornicula laryngis, which are of the reticular variety. The hyaline cartilages, especially in adult and advanced life, are prone , to calcify—that is to say, to have their matrix permeated by the salts of lime, without any appearance of true bone. This process of calcification occurs also, and still more frequently according to Rollett in such carti- lages as those of the trachea, which are prone afterwards to conversion into true bone. It is on the confines of true ossification that this cal- careous change or degeneration is most liable to occur, so that it is rare to find true bone and true cartilage in juxtaposition at the confines of the normal ossification, as for instance at the joint ends, at the ends of the ribs, in the symphysis pubis a,nd intervertebral cartilages. Fibro-cartilage consists of a mixture of white fibrous and cartilaginous tissues in various proportions ; it is to the first of these two constituents that its flexibility and toughness is chiefly owing, and to the latter its elasticity. The fibro-cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups— interarticular, connecting, circumferential, and stratiform. Fig. XII.—White fibrous cartilages from the seiiiiUiuar disc of the patella joint of an ox. Masnified loo times. The interarticular fibro-cartilages {menisci) are flattened fibro-cartila- ginous plates, of a round, oval, or sickle-like form, interposed between the articular cartilages of certain joints. They are free on both surfoces. thinner toward their centre than at their circumference, and held in position by their extremities being connected to the surrounding ligaments. The synovial membrane of the joint is prolonged over them a short distanco from their attached margin. They are found m the temporo-maxillary, stemo-clavicular, acromio-claviculao-, wrist and knee jomts. These car- tilac^es are usually found in those joints which are most exposed to violent concussions, and subject to frequent movement. Their use is—to maintain the apposition of the opposed surfaces in their various motions; to increa > the depth of the articular surface, and give ease to the gliding movement; to moderate the effects of great pressure, and deaden the intensity of tho shocks to which the parts may be submitted. Virchow describes in th. semilunar carriages of tho knee a system of anastomosing tubes, formedCARTILAGE. by cells which communicate with each other, and by means of which the nutritious fluids are conveyed into the interior of the mass. The semi- lunar discs, according- to this author, are wrongly denominated cartilages, since they yield no chondrine on boiling; and he appears to regard them as a modification of tendinous structure, which, however, agrees with the cartilages in the important particular of being non-vascular. See Virchow's ' Cellular Pathology,' by Chance, pp. 87-89. The connecting fihro-cartilages are interposed between the bony surfaces of those joints which admit of only slight mobility, as between the bodies of the vertebrae and the pubic symphyses ; they form discs, which adhere closely to both of the opposed bones, and are composed of concentric rings of fibrous tissue, with cartilaginous larainse interposed, the former tissue predominating towards the circumference, the latter towards the centre. The circumferential fihro-cartilages consist of a rim of fibro-cartilage, which surrounds the margin of some of the articular cavities, as the cotyloid cavity of the hip, and the glenoid cavity of the shoulder; they serve to deepen the articular surface and to protect the edges of the bone. The stratiform fihro-cartilages are those which form a thin layer in the osseous grooves, through which the tendons of certain muscles glide. Fig. Xlir.—Yellow cartilage, ear of horse. High power. ^ The yellow or reticular cartilages found in the human body are the epiglottis, cornicula laryngis, and the cartilaginous parts of the ear (auricle and Eustachian tube). In this variety the cartilage cells lie in the meshes of a network of yellow elastic fibres, with a double outline branching and anastomosing in all directions. The fibres resemble those of the yellow elastic fibrous tissue, both in appearance and in being unaffected by acetic acid, and according to EoUett their continuity with the elastic fibres of the neighbouring cellular tissue admits of beinff demonstrated. ° _ The distinguishing feature of cartilage as to its chemical composition IS that It yields on boiling a substance called chondrine, very similar to gelatine, but differing from it in not being precipitated by tannin. c1 GENPJRAL ANATOMY. BONE. Struckire and Physical Properties of Bone.—Bone is one of the hardest structures of the animal body; it possesses also a certain degree of toughness , and elasticity. Its colour, in a fresh state, is of a pinkish white ex- ternally, and deep red within. On examining a section of any bone, it is seen to be composed of two kinds of tissue, one of which is dense and compact in texture, like ivory: the other consisting of slender fibres and lamellte, which join to form a reticular structure; this, from its resem- blance to lattice work, is called cancellous. The compact tissue is always placed on the exterior of a bone ; the cancellous tissue is always internal. The relative quantity of these two kinds of tissue varies in different bones, and in different parts of the same bone, as strength or lightness is re- quisite. Close examination of the compact tissue shows it to be extremely porous, so that the difference in structure between it and the cancellous tissue depends merely upon the different amount of solid matter, and the size and number of the spaces in each; the cavities being small in the compact tissue, and the solid matter between them abundant; whilst in the cancellous tissue the spaces are large, and the solid matter in smaller quantity. Bone during life is permeated by vessels, and is enclosed in a fibrous membrane, the periosteum, by means of which most of these vessels reach the hard tissue. If the periosteum be stripped from the sm-face of the living bone, small bleeding points are seen, which mark the entrance of the periosteal vessels; and on section during life every part of the bone will be seen to exude blood, from the minute vessels which ramify in the Haversian canals. The interior of the bones of the limbs presents a cylin- drical cavity filled with marrow, and lined by a highly vascular areolar membrane, the medullary membrane or internal periosteum. The larger Haversian canals are also fiUed with marrow. The periosteum adheres to the surface of the bones in neai'ly every part, excepting at their cartilaginous extremities. Where strong tendons or ligaments are attached to the bone, the periosteum is incorporated with them. It consists of two layers closely united together ; the outer one formed chiefly of connective tissue, containing occasionally a few fat-ceUs; the inner one, of elastic fibres of the finer kind, forming dense membranous networks, which can be again separated into several layers (KoUiker). In young bones the periosteum is thick, and very vascular, and is intimately connected at either end of the bone with the epiphysial cartilage, but less closely with the shaft, from which it is separated by a layer of soft blastema, in which ossification proceeds on the exterior of the young bone. Later in life the periosteum is thinner, less vascular, and more closely connected with the adjacent bone, this adhesion growing stronger as age advances. The periosteum serves as a nidus for the ramification of the vessels previous to their distribution m the bone; hence the liability of bone to exfoliation or necrosis, when, from injury, it is denuded of this membrane. The marrow differs in composition at different periods of lite, and in different bones. In young bones, it is a transparent reddish fluid, otBONE. c 2 tenacious consistence, free from fat; and contains numerous minute roundish cells with many nuclei. In the shafts of adult long bones, the marrow is of a yellow colour, and contains, in lOO parts, 96 fat, I areolar tissue and vessels, and 3 of fluid with extractive matters; whilst, in the flat and short bones, in the articular ends of the long bones, in the bodies of the vertebrte, in the base of the cranium, and in the sternum and ribs, it is of a red colour, and contains, in 100 parts, 75 water and 25 soHd matter, consisting of albumen, fibrin, extractive matter, salts, and, a mere trace of fat. The red marrow is said by Kolliker to consist of a small quantity of areolar tissue and numerous medullary cells, and fat-, cells with a large quantity of fluid. Vessels of Bone.—The blood-vessels of bone are very numerous. Those of the compact tissue are derived from a close and dense network of vessels, ramifying in the periosteum. From this membrane, vessels pass into the minute orifices in the compact tissue, running through the canals which traverse its substance. The cancellous tissue is supplied in a similar way, but by a less numerous set of larger vessels, Avhich, per- forating the outer compact tissue, are distributed to the cavities of the spongy portion of the bone. In the long bones, numerous apertures may be seen at the ends near the articular surfaces, some of which give passage to the arteries referi-ed to; but the most numerous and largest apertures are for the veins of the cancellous tissue which run separately from the arteries. The medullary canal in the shafts of the long bones is supplied by one large artery (or sometimes more), which enters the bone at the nutrient foramen (situated in most cases near the centre of the shaft), and perforates obliquely the compact substance. This medul- lary or nutrient artery, usually accompanied by one or two veins, sends branches upwards and downwards, to supply the medullary membrane, which lines the central cavity and the adjoining canals. The ramifications of this vessel anastomose with the arteries both of the cancellous and compact tissues. In most of the flat, and in many of the short spongy bones, one or more large apertures are observed, which transmit, to the central parts of the bone, vessels corresponding to the medullary arteries and veins. The veins emerge from the long bones in three places (Kolliker). I. By a large vein which accompanies the nutrient artery; 2. by numerous large and small veins at the articular extremities; 3. by many small veins which arise in the compact substance. In the flat cranial bones, the veins are large, very numerous, and run in tortuous canals in the diploic tissue, the sides of the canals being formed of a thin lamella of bone, perforated here and there for the passage of branches from the adjacent canceUi. The veins thus enclosed and supported by the osseous structure, have exceedingly thin coats; and when the bony structure is divided, they remam patulous, and do not contract in the canals in which they are contained. Hence the constant occurrence of purulent absoi-ption after amputation, in those cases where the stump becomes inflamed, and the cancellous tissue is infiltrated and bathed in pus. Lymphatic vessels have been traced, by Cruikshank, into the substance of bone, but Kblhker doubts their existence. Nerves are distributed freely to the periosteum, and accompany the nutrient arteries into theGENERAL ANATOMY. Hi interior of the bone. They are said, by Kolliker, to be most numerous in the articular extremities of the long bones, in the vertebra?, and the larger flat bones. Minute Anatomy.—The intimate structure of bone, which in all essential particulars is identical in the compact and cancellous tissue, is most easily studied in a transverse section from the compact wall of one of the long bones after maceration, such as is shown in Fig. XIV. The large round spaces seen in the figure are the Haversian canals, and in these canals the larger vessels of the bone ramify. The fine lines leading out of (or into) these canals, are called canaliculi, and the irregular dark Fig. XIV.--From a transverse section of the diaphysis of the humerus, magnified 3 50 times, fl, Haversian canals; b, lacunfe, with their canaliculi in the lamellaa of these canals; c, lacunte of the interstitial lamellae; d, others at the surface of the Haversian systems, with canaliculi going ofl' from one side. Fig. XV.—Section parallel to the surface from the shaft of the femur, magnified 100 times, a, Haversian canals; b, lacunai seen from the side; c, others seen from the surface in lamellae which are cut horizontally. spaces, which ma,y be noticed to have a general circular arrangement round the Haversian canals, are called the lacunce. The canaliculi which originate in one lacuna most frequently run into a neighbouring lacuna, or else into a neighbouring Haversian canal; some of them, however, anastomose with others in their neighbourhood, and a few appear to terminate in blind extremities or to bend backwards. The concentric rings of lacunse round each Haversian canal are called lamella;. The irregular intervals which would be left by the juxtaposition of these lamellse, are seen in the figure to be filled up by lacunse and canaliculi which communicate with the systems composing the adjacent lamellse. The interspaces between the lacunaa and canaliculi are filled with a granular homogeneous solid material, the ultimate mineral base of the bone. If a longitudinal section be taken, as in Fig. XV., the appearances areliii BONE. identical. The lamellated or concentric arrangement is indeed lost, and the Haversian canals appear like half-tubes instead of circular spaces, and these tubes are seen to branch and communicate (so that each separate Haversian canal runs only a short distance), but in other respects the structure has much the same a.ppearance as in transverse sections. In sections of thin plates of bone (as in the walls of the cells which form the cancellous tissue), the Haversian canals are absent, whenever the thickness of bone is not too great to allow of its nutritious juices being absorbed from the fibrous membrane coating either side by means of the lacunae and canaliculi only; but when the thickness becomes at all considerable, Haversian systems begin to appear. Thus the spaces of the cancellous tissue (medullary spaces) have the same function there that the Haversian canals have in the more compact tissue. In the long bones, by maceration in dilute mineral acid, it may easily be shown that besides these microscopic lamella) surrounding each Haversian canal, the whole bone is composed of distinct laminse, concen- trically disposed around the medullary tube. These laminae are crossed and pinned together, as it were, by the fibres of bone running obliquely through them, which were first described by Dr. Sharpey, and named by him perforating fibres. In the flat bones parallel or superimposed plates can be demonstrated similarly held together by perforating fibres, which are more numerous than in the long bones.'* Besides the Haversian canals larger and irregularly shaped spaces are found—Haversian spaces—which are, as it were, a transition from the Haversian canals to the medullary spaces of the cancellous tissue. It seems as if both the medullary spaces and the Haversian spaces are formed by absorption, as we shall try to explain in speaking of the development and growth of bone. These Haversian spaces are found chiefly in growing bones; but they occur also, though in less number, in the adult bones. They have irregular jagged outlines, and the adjoining systems of lacunse and canaliculi are seen to be eaten away by them. When the microscopic structure of bone was first demonstrated, it was believed that the lacunse were solid cells, and their canaliculi solid processes from those cells. Subsequently, when it was seen that the Haversian canals are channels, which lodge the vessels of the part, and the canaliculi and lacuna spaces by which the plasma of the blood, or the blood itself, circulates through the tissue, it was taught that the lacuna were hollow spaces filled during life with that fluid, and only hned (if lined at all) by a delicate membrane. But this view appears also to be delusive. Examination of the structure of the bone when recent, has led Yirchow to believe that the so-called lacunjB are really fiUed up during life with a nucleated cell, the processes from which pass down the canahculi. It is by means of these cells that the fluids necessary for nutrition are brought into contact with the ultimate tissue ot the bone. The animal part of a bone may be obtained by immersing the bone a considerable time in dilute mineral acid, after which process the e comes out exactly the same size and shape as before, but perfectly * Sharpey, in Quain's Anatomy, 7th edit, p. xcvGENERAL ANATOMY. liv flexible—so that a long bone (one of the ribs is the usual example) can easily be tied in a knot. If now a transverse section be made, the same general arrangement of the Haversian canals, lamella, lacunae, and canali- culi is seen, though not so plainly as in the macerated specimen. If the individual lamellae are examined, they n 1 4. 1, T /• r-i Fit?. XVr.—Section of bone after the removal are found to be composed of fibres, the earthy matter by the action of acids. most of which are nearly parallel; l)ut which interlace together, and anastomose or communicate with the fibres of the neighbouring lamellae. The organic or animal constituent of a bone is only incompletely removed by maceration, leaving the bone for an indefinite period perfectly tough and coherent; but after being long kept in a warm dry atmosphere, or by incineration in a furnace, the animal part may be entu'ely removed, and then the earthy constituent will retain the form of the original bone, but on the slightest force it will crumble down. The animal base is often called cartilage, but differs from it in the following respects : viz., that it is softer and more flexible, and when boiled with a high pressure is almost entirely resolved into gelatine. Cartilage does, however, form the animal basis of bone in certain parts of the skeleton. Thus, according to Tomes and De Morgan, it occurs in the petrous part of the temporal bone, and, according to Dr. Sharpey, on the articular ends of adult bones, lying underneath the natural cartilage of the joint. Chemical analysis.—The organic constituent of bone forms about one- third, or 33*3 per cent.; the inorganic matter, two-thirds, or 667 per cent.; as is seen in the subjoined analysis by Berzelius:— Organic Matter, Inorganic, or Earthy Blatter, Gelatine and Blood-vessels . . 33-30 Phosphate of Lime . 51-04 Carbonate of Lime . 11-30 Fluoride of Calcium 2"00 Phosphate of Magnesia. . 116 . Soda and Chloride of Sodium I "20 lOOOO Some chemists add to this about one per cent, of fat. The relative proportions of the two constituents of bone are found to differ in different hones of the skeleton, as shown by Dr. Owen Eees. Thus, the bones of the head, and the long bones of the exti-emities, contain more earthy matter than those of the trunk; and those of the upper extremity somewhat more than the corresponding bones of the lower extremity. The humerus contains more earthy matter than the bones of the fore-arm; and the femur more than the tibia and fibula. The vertebm% ribs and clavicle, contain nearly the same proportion of earthy matter. The metacarpal and metatarsal bones contain about the same proportion as those of the trunk. Much difi"erence exists in the analyses given by chemists to the proportion between the two constituents of bone at different j^eriods of life According to Schreger, and others, there is a considerable increase in theBONE. Iv earthy constituents of the bones with advancing years. Dr. Eees states, that this is especially marked in the long bones, and the bones of the head, which, in the foetus, do not contain the excess of earthy matter found in those of the adult. But the bones of the trunk in the fcetus, according to this analyst, contain as much earthy matter as those of the adult. On the other hand, the analyses of Stark and Von Bibra show, that the proportions of animal and earthy matter are almost precisely the same at different periods of life. According to the analyses of Von Bibra, Valentin, and Dr. Eees, the compact substance contains more earthy matter than the cancellous. The comparative analysis of the same bones in both sexes shows no essential difference between them. There are facts of some practical interest, bearing upon the diflPerence which seems to exist in the amount of the two constituents of bone at different periods of life. Thus, in the child, where the animal matter predominates, it is not uncommon to find, after an injury to the bones, that they become bent, or only partially broken, from the large amount of flexible animal matter which they contain. Again, in aged people, where the bones contain a large proportion, of earthy matter, the animal matter at the same time being deficient in quantity and quality, the bones are more brittle, their elasticity is destroyed; and, hence, fracture takes place more readily. Some of the diseases, also, to which bones are liable, mainly depend on the disproportion between the two constituents of bone. Thus, in the disease called rickets, so common in the children of scrofulous parents, the bones become bent and curved, either from the superincum- bent weight of the body, or under the action of certain muscles. This depends upon some defect of nutrition, by which bone becomes deprived of its normal proportion of earthy matter, whilst the animal matter is of unhealthy quality. In the vertebrae of a ricketty subject, Dr. Bostock found in 100 parts 79'75 animal, and 20'2$ earthy matter. Development of hone.—In the foetal skeleton, some bones, such as the long bones of the limbs, are cartilaginous, others, as the cranial bones, are membranous.* Hence two kinds of ossification are described: the intra-cartilaginous and the intra-membranous; and to these a third is sometimes added, the subperiosteal, which is a variety of the second. In the intra-cartilaginous ossification the first step is that the cartilage cells increase rapidly in number, and arrange themselves in rows, with the long axis of the cell transverse to that of the future bone. The cells are closely packed, and in some places are even wedged together, an appearance which is supposed to be due to their cleavage horizontally. The accompanying illustration, taken from Rollett's article in Strieker's 'Handb. der Lehre von den Geweben,' p. 95, will save much of minute detail, and make the accompanying description intelligible. The intra-cellular matrix of the cartilage a is still semi-transparent, though somewhat granular. Lying below this cartilaginous layer {i.e. nearer to the centre of ossification), is a layer, h, consisting of large round The bones which are developed entirely in membrane nre the occipital, as far as it enters into the formation of the Tanlt of the skull, the parietal and frontal bones, the squamous portion of the temporal with the tympanic ring, the AVormian bones, the nasal, lachrymal, malar, palate, upper and lower maxillary, and vomer: also, apparently, the internal pterygoid plate and the sphenoidal turbinated bones.Ivi GENERAL ANATOMY. clear cells (tlie 'osteoblasts' of some anatomists), with granular contents, also arranged in somewhat parallel rows, each row and each pair of super- imposed cells being separated by a transparent cartilaginous matrix—the arrangement being compared by Rollett to a ladder. In the lower part of this region the matrix is encroached upon by calcareous matter, so that if a transverse section be made here, rings of dark granular calcareous deposit are seen enclosing the large round cells. As the section is taken deeper and deeper into the ossifying part, the calcified rings or Fig. XVII.—Longitudinal section through the ossifying portion of a long bone in the human embryo, a, Cartilnginous region, b, Eegion of the round clear cells, ff, Region of the dark gi-anular masses. •areolee are seen to enclose numerous smaller granular masses (' primitive marrow' of some authors) which have replaced the single clear cells, and may be formed by the proliferation of those cells. This, however, is doubted by Eollett and obhers, who believe that these masses are furnished by the underlying periosteal vessels. In the longitudinal section these masses are seen (at g) to succeed very suddenly to the separate clear cells. If they are detached from the surface, they are found to have one or more processes. Deeper down in the ossifying, or ossified portion, blood-vessels are met with, which proceed from the periosteum. The next step in the process is that the above-described areolte (' pri- mary areolae') break into each other, so as to give rise to the ' secondary areolae,' or medullary spaces of II. Miiller. These spaces are filled withBONE. Ivii the red or festal marrow above described. The cells of this marrow appeared to be furnished directly from the blood-vessels which are abundantly supplied to these spaces from the underlying vessels proceed- ing fro7n the periosteal tissue. It is to these vessels, and to the cavities or tubes which they form for themselves as they proceed inwards, that the origin of the Haversian canals is due. The origin of the lacunse and of the bone-cells which fill them is still a matter of dispute. Kolliker, Virchow, and many other anatomists, maintain that in the intra-cartilaginous ossification they are developed directly from the cartilage-cells, the investing membrane of which ossifies and forms the bony lacuna, while its nucleus is developed into the bone- cell. Others, as Dr. Sharpey, H. Miiller, and Eollett, believe that the cartilage-cells, after becoming developed into the 'osteoblasts,' above described, and shown at b, Fig. XVII., become dissolved, and shed their granular contents to form the bony matrix, while the lacunse and bone- corpuscles are developed from the granular masses, which are seen below g in the figure, and which are furnished, according to these authors, from the vessels of the periosteum or perichondrium. If this view be correct, the intimate process is the same in all forms of ossification. Thus far, then, we have followed the steps of a process by which a solid bony mass is produced, having vessels running into it from the periosteum. Haversian canals in which those vessels run, medullary spaces filled with foetal marrow, lacunae with their contained bone-cells, and canaliculi growing out of those lacunse. This process of ossification, however, is not the origin of the whole of the skeleton, for even in those bones in which the ossification proceeds in a great measure from a single centre situated in the cartilaginous diaphysis, a considerable part of the original bone is formed by intra-membranous ossification beneath the perichondrium or periosteum. Kolliker (following H. Miiller, and referring to an observation of Howship to the same effect made so long ago as 1819), describes the first rudiment of a long bone as having the form of a tube, surrounding the primordial cartilage; thus showing that the intra-membranous ossification of the outer part of the bone from the periosteum even precedes the intra-cartilaginous deve- lopment of its interior from the ' ossific centre.' Also, a great part of the increase in girth of the bone takes place by bony deposit from the deeper layer of the periosteum. This process is now acknowledged to belong to the mtra-membranous form of ossification. Thus even in long bones only a portion of their tissue is formed by intra-cartilaginous ossification. The shaft of the bone is at first solid, but a tube is gradually hollowed out m It by absorption around the vessels passing into it, which becomes the medullary canal; and as more and more bone is deposited from the periosteum, so more and more is removed from around the medul- lary membrane, untU at length the bone has attained the shape and size which It IS destined to retain during adult life. As the ossifica- tion of the cartilagmous diaphysis extends towards the articular ends it carries with it, as it were, a layer of cartilage, or the cartilage gi-ows as It ossifies. During this period of growth the articular end, or epiphysis, remains for some time entirely cartilaginous, then a bony centre appears m it, and it commences the same process of intra-carti-Iviii GENERAL ANATOMY. lag-inous ossification, but this process uever extends to any very great , i distance. The epiphyses remain separated from the shaft by a narrow || . cai-tilaginous layer for a definite time. This layer ultimately ossifies, the • I distinction between shaft and epiphysis is obliterated, and the bone has i I assumed its completed form and shape. The same remarks also apply ;1 to the processes of bone which are separately ossified, and called aijophysea. I The intra-cartilaginous ossification, and the growth by means of epi- 1 physes, are usually described from the long bones; but almost all the || bones of the body are primarily laid down in cartilage (see note, p. Iv.); 1 and a great many of the flat and short bones grow by means of epiphyses,, as will be seen in the detailed description of each, given in the body of ■ the work. The medullary spaces which characterise the cancellous tissue are- produced by the absorption of the original foetal bone in the same way as • the medullary tube is formed, and the same is the case with the Haversian spaces above referred to as a sort of intermediate step between the' Haversian canals and the medullary spaces. Thus the distinction between the cancellous and compact tissue appears to depend essentially upon the extent to which this process of absorption has been carried, and we may perhaps remind the reader that in morbid states of the bone inflammatory absorption effects exactly the same change, and converts portions of bone naturally compact, into cancellous tissue. The intra-membranous ossification is that by which the bones of the vertex of the skull are entirely formed. In the bones which are so de- veloped no cartilaginous mould precedes the appearance of the bone tissue. The process, though pointed out originally by Dr. Nesbitt in the year 1736, was first accurately described by Dr. Sharpey; and it does not appear that subsequent observers have been able to add anything essential I to his description. This is, substantially, as follows:—In the membrane which occupies the place of the future bone a little network of bony spiculse is first noticed, radiating from the point of ossification. When these rays of growing bone are examined by the microscope, there is found a network of fine clear fibres (osteogenic fibres), which become dark ! and granular from calcification, and as they calcify they ai'e found to enclose in their interior large granular corpuscles (the so-called ' osteo- i blasts' described above in the account of the intra-cartilaginous ossifica- tion). These corpuscles at first lie upon the osteogenic fibres, so that the corpuscles must be removed by brushing the specimen with a hair-pencil in order to render the fibres clear; but they gradually sink into areola> developed among the fibres. The areolse appear to be the rudiments of the lacunae, the passages between the fibres form the canalicuH, and the |l osteoblasts are the rudiments of the bone-cells. As the tissue increases in thickness vessels shoot into it, grooving for themselves spaces or chan- nels, which become the Haversian canals. The subperiosteal is in all essential respects identical with the intra- membranous process of ossification. The period of ossification is different in different bones. The order of succession may be thus aiTanged (Kolliker):— In the second month, first, in the clavicle, and lower jaw (fifth to seventh ilix BONE. week; then, in the vertebroB, humerus, femur, the ribs, and the car- tilaginous portion of the occipital bone. . At the end of the second, and commencement of the third month, the frontal bone, the scapula, the bones of the fore-arm and leg, and upper jaw, make their appearance. In the third month, the remaining cranial bones, with few exceptions, the metatarsus, the metacarpus, and the phalanges, begin to ossify. In the fourth month, the iliac bones, and the ossicula auditus. In the fourth or fifth month, the ethmoid, sternum, os pubis, and ischium. From the sixth to the seventh month, the calcaneum, and astragalus. In the eighth month, the hyoid bone. At birth, the epiphyses of aU the cylindrical bones, with the exception of the lower epiphysis of the femur, and occasionally the upper epiphysis of the tibia; all the bones of the carpus; the five smaller ones of the tarsus; the patella; the sesamoid bones; and the coccyx,"^ are still unossified. From the time of birth to the fourth year, osseous nuclei make their appearance also in these parts. At twelve years, in the pisiform bone. The number of ossific centres is different in different bones. In most of the short bones, ossification commences by a single point in the centre, and proceeds towards the circumference. In the long bones, there is a central point of ossification for the shaft or diaphysis; and one or more for each extremity, the epiphyses. That for the shaft is first to appear; those for the extremities appear later. The union of the epi- physes with the shaft takes place in the inverse order to that in which their ossification began; for although ossification commences latest in those epiphyses toAvards which the nutrient artery in the several bones is directed, they become joined to the diaphyses sooner than the epiphyses at the opposite extremity, with the exception of the fibula, the lov/er end of which commences to ossify at an earlier period than the upper end, but, nevertheless, is joined to the shaft earliest. The order in which the epiphyses become united to the shaft, appears to be regulated by the direction of the nutrient artery of the bone. Thus, the nutrient arteries of the bones of the arm and fore-arm are directed towards the elbow, and the epiphyses of the bone forming this joint become united to the shaft before those at the opposite extremity. In the lower extremities, on the contrary, the nutrient arteries pass in a direction from the knee; that is, upwards in the femur, downwards in the tibia and fibula; and in them It is observed, that the upper epiphysis of the femur, and the lower epiphyses of the tibia and fibula, become first united to the shaft. Where there is only one epiphysis, the medullary artery is directed towards that end of the bone where there is no additional centre": as, towards the acromial end in the clavicle; towards the distal end of the metacarpal bone of the thumb and great toe; and towards the proximal end of the other metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Besides these epiphyses for the articular ends, there are others (more commonly called apophyses) for projecting parts, or processes, which are • On the development of the coccyx, vide infra, p. 17.GENERAL ANATOMY. formed separately from the bulk of the bone. For an account of these, the reader must be referred to the descriptions of the individual bones in the sequel. A knowledge of the exact periods when the epiphyses become joined to the shaft is often of great importance in medico-legal enquiries. It also . aids the surgeon in the diagnosis of many of the injuries to which the joints are liable; for it not unfrequently happens, that on the application, of severe force to a joint, the epiphyses become separated from the shaft, and such injuries may be mistaken for fracture or dislocation. MUSCULAR TISSUE. Fig. XVin.—Transverse section from the sterno-mastoid in man, 50 times magnified, a, External perimysium, b, In- ternal perimysium, c, Primi- tive and secondary fasciculi. The muscles are formed of bundles of reddish fibres, endowed with the property of contractility. Two kinds of muscular tissue are found in the animal body, viz., that of voluntary or animal life, and that of involuntary or organic life. The muscles of animal life {striped muscles) are capable of being put in action and con- trolled by the will. They are composed of bundles of fibres enclosed in a delicate web of areolar tissue, called in the figure the * perimysium.' Each bundle consists of numerous smaller bundles, enclosed in a similar fibro-areolar covering, and these again of primitive fasciculi. The fibres are of no great length—not extending, it is said, further than an- inch and a half. They end either by blending with the tendon or aponeurosis, or else by becoming drawn out into a tapering extremity which is connected to the neighbouring fibre by means of the sarcolemma. The precise mode in which the muscular fibre joins the tendon has been variously described by dif- ferent observers. It may, perhaps, be sufficient here to say that the sarcolemma, or membranous investment of the muscular fibre, appears to become blended with the tissue of the tendon, and that the muscular fibre appears to be prolonged more or less into the tendon, so that the latter forms a kind of sheath around the fibre for a longer or shorter distance. When muscular fibres are attached to the skin or mucous membranes, their fibres are described by Salter as becoming continuous with those of the areolar tissue. The primitive fasciculi consist of a number of filaments, enclosed in a tubular sheath of transparent, elastic, and apparently homogeneous mem- brane, named by Bowman the 'Sarcolemma.' The primitive fasciculi are cylindriform or prismatic. Their breadth varies in man from to 3^ of an inch, the average of the majority being about ^0; their length is not always in proportion to the length of the muscle, but depends on the arrangement of the tendons. This form of muscular fibre is especially characterised by being apparently marked with very fine, dark lines orMUSCULAR TISSUE.

These appearances would favour the suggestion that the elementary particles of which the fibrils are composed are possibly nucleated ceDs, cohering in a linear series, the transverse marks between them corresponding to their line of junction.

This form of muscular fibre composes the whole of the voluntary muscles, all tlie muscles of the ear, those of the larynx, pharynx, tongue, the upper half of the oesophagus, the heart, and the walls of the large < veins at the point where they open into it. The fibres of the heart, however, differ in Fif?- XXI.—Anastomosing muscu- , ,. , „ ,, « , 1 1-1 nbres of the heart seen in a several particulars from those 01 other Striped longitudinal section. On the muscles. They are smaller by about one- thii'd, and their transverse striae are by no means so distinct. Fat-cells are also often found in them to a certain extent, even apart from any obvious disease of the organ. They break up much more readily into their smallest elements. There is also much less (if any) connective tissue separating the bundles of fibres; and Kolliker has described and figured the ultimate fibres as anasto- mosing with each other, a fact previously noticed by Leeuwenhoeck. Schweigger- Seidel also describes and figures transverse septa, which divide the fibres into separate nucleated portions (fig. XXI.). The unstriped muscle, or muscle of in- . - organic life, is found in the walls of the hollow viscera, viz. the lower half of the cesophagus and the whole of the remainder of the gastro-intestinal tube; in the trachea and bronchi; in the gall-bladder and ductus communis choledochus; in the pelvis and calices of the kidney, the ureters, bladder, and urethra; in the female sexual organs, viz. the Fallopian tubes, the uterus (enormously developed in pregnancy), the vagina, the broad ligaments, and the erectile tissue of the clitoris; in the male sexual organs, viz. the dartos scroti, the vas deferens, and epididymis, the vesiculse seminales, the prostate gland and the corpora cavernosa;* in the ducts of certain glands, as in Wharton's duct; in the capsule and trabeculse of the spleen; in the arteries, veins, and lymphatics; in the iris; and in the skin. The fibres of inorganic muscle form flattened bands, interlacing in various directions, and which when viewed without reagents appear nearly homogeneous, though if the organ from which the fibres are taken has been macerated previously for some time in dilute acid, the nuclei can be perceived. Even in fresh fibres the nuclei are occasionally visible. In many situations these fibres, by prolonged immersion in chromic or nitric acid, can be resolved into the elementary contractile fibre-cells of which KoUiker has shown that they really consist; and in some parts, as in the arteries and in the skin, such fibre-cells are found single. They are elongated, their length about ten to fifteen times their breadth (-02 to 0-4'" in length, -002'" to -003'" in breadth, according to Kolliker), con- sistino- of a spindle-shaped, homogeneous-looking, fibre-ceU, m which a • Kolliker describes muscular fibres also in the tunica vaginalisIxiii MUSCULAR TISSUE. rod-shaped nucleus is faintly visible. Acetic acid dissolves out the granular contents of the cell, and brings the nucleus clearly into view. The unstriped muscle, as a rule, is not under the hifluence of the will, nor is the contraction rapid and involving the whole muscle, as is the case with the muscles of animal life. The membranes which are composed of the unstriped muscle slowly contract in a part of their extent, generally under the influence of mechanical stimulus, as that of distension or of cold, and then the contracted part slowly relaxes, while another portion of the membrane takes up the contraction. This peculiarity of action is most strongly marked in the intestines, constituting their vermicular motion. In chemical composition, the muscular fibres of both forms consist mainly of a substance {syntonin) nearly identical with the fibrine of the Fig. XXII.—Non-striated ele- mentary fibres from the hu- man colon, rt, Treated with acetic acid, showing the corpuscles, b, Fragment of a detached fibre, not touched ■with acid.

The capillaries of muscle are very abundant, and form a series of rectangular areola, the branches, which run longitudinally between the muscular fibres, being united at short intervals by transverse anasto- mosing branches. Nerves are profusely distributed to the muscular tissue, more especially to the voluntary muscles. The mode of their termination wiU be described on a subsequent page. The distribution and the mode of origin of the lymphatic vessels ot muscle has not yet been ascertained. The muscles during life, and for some time after death, respond to the appropriate stimulus by contracting in the manner peculiar to the classGENERAL ANATOMY. Ixiv to which they belong. Thus, for some time after a limb has been, amputated, its muscles can be set in motion by scratching, pinching, or- galvanising them; and even after the irritability of the muscular tissue has been exhausted by the prolonged suspension of the circulation, it can be at first temporarily restored by injecting fresh arterial blood through. it (Brown-Sequard). The time at which muscular irritability ceases after death depends on the vitality of the subject; thus it ceases in birds, whose circulation and vital heat are of a very high degree, sooner than in man and quadrupeds; in these sooner than in fishes, &c. Dr. Sharpey says that it lasts long in hybernating animals killed during their winter sleep. It is also affected by the mode of dying, being extinguished instan- taneously (as is asserted) in some cases of lightning-stroke, and much diminished by certain gaseous poisons, particularly sulphuretted hydrogen. As the muscles die they become stiff, and it is to this cause that the rigidity so characteristic of recent death (' rigor mortis') is due. The ultimate cause of the phenomenon is not well understood, beyond the obvious fact that it must be due to the change from partial fluidity to a solid condition of the contents of the sarcolemma. The periods of its occurrence and of its disappearance are very variable, and the causes of' those variations are of extreme interest and importance, especially in medico-legal enquiries, but the subject is too complicated to be adequately treated here. All that need be said in this place is that, as might be expected, the rigor is stronger the more powerful and more healthy the muscles are, and consequently, is both more powerful and more lasting in cases of sudden or violent death. It also sets in later in such cases, while in emaciated and exhausted subjects it is more rapid and transient: as is also the case, according to Hunter, in animals which have been hunted to death. In some instances of violent death in persons of robust frame, the rigor mortis has not entirely disappeared till the end of the first week after death. In rare cases (as in some instances of death from lightning) the muscles are found rigid immediately, and in other cases rigor com- mences in a few minutes, but usually not till six or seven hours after death. The cessation of rigidity in the muscles must be regarded as the commencement of putrefactive changes. NERVOUS TISSUE. The nervous tissue is composed chiefly of two different structures, the grey or vesicular, and the white or Jihrous. It is in the former, as is generally supposed, that nervous impressions and impulses originate, and by the latter that they are conducted. Hence the grey matter forms the essential constituent of all the ganglionic centres, both those separated iu the ganglia, and those aggregated in the cerebro-spinal axis; while the white matter is found in aU the commissural portions of the nerve centres, and in all the cerebro-spinal nerves. Beside these two principal kinds of nervous matter, there is found a third structure—chiefly in the sym- pathetic system—called the gelatinous nerve-tissue. The nervous substance is again divided into two different systems. The first is connected directly with the great central mass enclosed in theNERVOUS TISSUE. Ixv skull and spine. This is called the cerebrospinal system, and is divided into the brain (inclnding- the medulla oblongata), the spinal cord, the cranial nerves, the spinal nerves, and the ganglia connected with both those classes of nerves. The second, called the sympathetic system, is not directly connected with the brain or spinal cord, though it is so indirectly by means of its numerous communications with the cranial and spinal nerves. It consists of a double chain of ganglia, with the branches which go to and come from them. A third method of division of the nervous system is based upon the functions which it performs. On this principle it is divided into the nervous system of animal life and the nervous system of organic life—the former subserving the higher functions of volition, sensation, &c., the latter those of growth and nutrition. It is clear that the former qualities reside mainly in the cerebro-spinal system, while the intimate connection between the sympathetic nerve and the great viscera renders it highly Fig:.

Each vesicle consists of an exceedinglyGENERAL AITATOMY. delicate membranous wall, enclosing a finely granular material, part ol" whicL. is occasionally of a coarser kind, and of a reddish or yellowish- brown colour. The nucleus is vesicular, much smaller than the vesicle, and adherent to some part of its interior. The nucleolus, which is enclosed within the nucleus, is vesicular in form, of minute size, and peculiarly clear and brilliant. The nerve-corpuscles vary in shape and size; some are small, spherical, or ovoidal, with an uninterrupted outline. These forms are most numerous in the ganglia of the sympathetic. Others, called caudate or stellate nerve-corpuscles, are characterised by their larger size, and from having one or more tail-like processes issuing from them, which occasionally divide and subdivide into numerous branches. These pro- cesses are very delicate, apparently tubular, and contain a similar granular material to that found within the corpuscle. Some of the processes terminate in fine transparent fibres, which become lost among the other Fig. XXVI.—Human nerve-tubes, magnified 350 times. Three of them are fine, one of -which is varicose, one of middling thickness, and with a simple contour; and three thick, two of which are double con- toured, and one with grumous contents.

The white, otherwise caUed tubular or fibrous nervous substance, is found constituting a great part of the brain and spinal cord, almost the whole of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and a great pai-t of the sympathetic The tubes, when perfectly fresh, appear to be homogeneous, but they soon separate into two parts, the white substance of Schwann and the a^is-aylLder of Purkinje, the whole being enclosed m a structui-eless membrane-the tubular membrane* The white substance is regaided as being a fatty matter in a fluid state, which isolates and protects the essential part of the nerve-the axis-cylinder. The partial coagulation of this white substance which foUows on cooling gives the nerve-tube, when examined after death, a double contour-the daa-ker pai't seen on the ; .

This is, of course, promoted by the action of ether. The axis-cylinder constitutes about one-half or one-third of the nerve- tube, the white substance being greater in proportion in the nerves than in the central organs. The axis-cylinder is perfectly transparent, and is therefore indistinguishable in a perfectly fresh and natural state of the nerve. It is described by Kolliker as being distinguished from the white substance by the fact that though soft and flexible it is not fluid and viscid, but firm and elastic, somewhat like coagulated albumen, with which it appears for the most part also to agree in its chemical characters. In appearance it is pale and homogeneous, or more rarely finely granular or striated. Beside these nerve-fibres, which consist of two distinct parts, others are found in which only the axis-cylinder can be recognised, surrounded by its medullary membrane, whilst there are again mere primitive fibrils found in various parts which are perfectly destitute of any visible struc- ture, and only recognised as nerves by their connection with ganglionic cells, or with obvious nerve-tubes.* They display a great tendency to become varicose on manipulation. The finely-striated appearance of those nerves, which consist only of the axis-cylinder and its membranous invest- ment, renders it probable that these also are formed of an aggregation of the primitive fibrillse. Thus three different kinds of white nerve-fibres are described by recent authorities—viz., i. Those which consist of the axis-cylinder, ensheathed in the white substance of Schwann, the whole being invested by the tubular membrane; 2. those which consist of the axis-cylinder and medul- lary membrane only; and 3. the primitive fibrils, of which it is believed that the axis-cylinder of the more composite nerves is made up.f Most of the nerves of the sympathetic system, and some of the cerebro- spinal (see especially the description of the olfactory nerve, infra, p. 498), consist of a fourth description of nervous fibres, J which are called the grey or gelatinous nerve-fibres (fibres of Eemak). These consist of a bundle of finely-granular fibriUse, enclosed in a sheath. Nuclei may be detected at intervals in each fibre, which Schultze believes to be situated in the sheath of the nerve. In external appearance the gelatinous nerves are semi-transparent, and grey or yellowish-grey. The individual fibres vary in size—most of them being of smaller size than in the cerebro-spinal nerves, so that the average size of the latter is given at to ^oVo of an inch, and of the former at only half that size; but, on the one hand, * Schultze (Stricker'8 Bandhuch, fig. 17, p. 109) represents these primitive fibrils, hotli in their connection -with ganglion-cells and with larger nerves. See also below, l^lg. XXXIV. t Schultze believes that the primitive fibrils are the essential element of all nerves; thus, according to him, the essential difference between the gelatinous and the ordinary nerve fibnls consists in the absence from the former of the white substance (medulla) of Schwann, while the tubular membrane is present. The small nerve-fibres, on the other hand, described as primitive fibrils or naked axis-cylinders, are either destitute of any investment, or sur- rounded merely by a structureless basement membrane. t The real nature of these fibres has been doubted by several authors. It seems better, however, and more consonant with the prevalent opinion, to describe them as ti'uly nervoua. d2GENERAL ANATOMY. Ixviii the smallest fibrils of the cerebro-spinal system are, as we have seen, of hardly appreciable thickness; while, on the other, some of the gelatinous fibres (especially those in the olfactory bulb) are said to be three or four times as thick as those of the cerebro-spinal nerves. Chemical composition.—The following analysis, by Lassaigne, represents the relative proportion of the different constituents composing the grey and white matter of the brain:— Grey. White. . . . 85-2 . 73-0 99 13-9 09 1-4 10 1-3 lOO'O 100 0 It appears from this analysis, that the cerebral substance consists of albumen, dissolved in Avater, combined with fatty matters and salts. The fatty matters, according to Fremy, consist of cei*ebric acid, which is most abundant, cholesterin, oleophosphoric acid, and olein, margarin, and traces of their acids. The same analyst states that the fat contained in the brain is confined almost exclusively to the white substance, and that its colour becomes lost when the fatty matters are removed. According to Vauquelin, the cord contains a larger proportion of fat than the brain ; and, according to L'Heritier, the nerves contain more albumen and more soft fat than the brain. With regard to the constitution of the different portions of the nervous system, the cerebro-spinal axis is composed of the two above-described kinds of nervous structure, intermingled in various proportions, and having in the brain a very intricate arrangement, which can only be fully understood by a careful study of the details of its descriptive anatomy in the sequel. The grey or vesicular nervous matter is found partly on the surface of the brain, forming the convolutions of the cerebrum, which are in the most direct relation to the mental faculties, and the laminae of the cerebellum, the functions of which are still a matter of dispute. Again, grey matter is found in the interior of the brain, collected into large and distinct masses or ganglionic bodies, such as the corpus striatum, optic thalamus, and corpora quadrigemina; the functions of which bodies, so fai' as they have been ascertained, have been found to be connected with some of the main organic endowments of the body, such as voluntary motion, sensation, sight. Finally, grey matter is found intermingled intimately with the white, and without definite arrangement, as in the corpora dentata of the medulla and cerebellum, or the grey matter in the Pons and the floor of the fourth ventricle. Such scattered masses of grey matter are, in many instances at any rate, connected to all appearance with the origin of particular nerves. In other situations their use is as yet unknown. The propernervous matter, both in the brain and spinal cord, is traversed and supported by a network of fine connective tissue. This has been termed by Virchow the neuroglia, and is supposed to be the source of ouo of the forms of tumour described by that author under the name of ylioma. The white matter of the brain is divisible into four distinct classes otBRAIK. Ixix .fibres There are, in the first place, the nerves which arise in the grey imatter, and pass ont through the cranial foramina. Next, the fibres Iwhich connect the brain with the spinal cord j that is to say, those which are nsually traced upwards from the columns of the spinal cord, through the medulla oblongata into the cerebrum, chiefly by means of the anterior pyi-amids, fasciculi teretes aiidrestiform bodies, passing through the Pons and crura cerebri to expand into the corpora striata, optic thalami and convolutions (corona radiata), and, by means of the restiform bodies, into the cerebellum. The other two classes of white fibres in the brain are commissural; some of the commissures serving to connect different parts of the same hemisphere together (as the fornix, the processus e cerebello ad testes, &c.), or even difi'erent parts of the same section or organ, as the arciform fibres of the medulla. Most of these commissures are longitudinal; while others—as the corpus callosum and the transverse fibres of the Pons Yarolii—are transverse, serving to connect opposite hemisi^heres together, and thus probably securing the single action of a double organ. The following is Dr. Lockhart Clarke's account of the intimate struc- ture of the cerebral convolutions.:— ' Most of the convolutions, when properly examined, may be seen to consist of at least seven distinct and concentric layers of nervous substance, which are alternately paler and darker from the circumference to the centre. The laminated structure is most strongly marked at the extremity of the posterior lobe. In this situation all the nerve-cells are small, but differ considerably in shape, and are much more abundant in some layers than in others. In the superficial layer, which is pale, they are round, oval, fusiform, and angular, but not numerous. The second aud darker layer is densely crowded with cells of a similar kind, in company with others that are pyriform and pyramidal, and lie with their tapering ends either towards the surface or parallel with it, in connection with fibres whicb run in corresponding directions. The broader ends of the pyramidal cells give off two, thi-ee, four, or more processes, which run partly through the white axis of the convolution,, and in part horizontally along the ]plane of the layer, to be continuous like those at the opposite ends of the cells, with nerve-fibres running in different directions. The ' third layer is of a much paler colour. It is crossed, however, at right ; angles by narrow and elongated groups of small cells and nuclei of : the same general appearance as those of the preceding layer. These groups are' separated from each other by bundles of fibres, radiating • towards the surface from the central white axis of the convolution, and ' together with them form a beautiful fanlike structure.. The fowrth layer also contains elongated groups of small cells and- nuclei, radiating at right angles to its plane; but the groups are broader, more regular, and, 1 together with the bundles of fibres between them, present a more dis- dinctly fanlike structure. The fifth layer is again paler and somewhat •white. It contains, however, cells and nuclei which have a general resemblance to those of the preceding layers, but they exhibit only a ■ faintly radiating arrangement. The sixth and most internal layer is •reddish grey. It not only abounds in cells like those already described, but contains others that are ra,ther larger. It is only here and tliere that I the cells are collected into elongated groups, which give the appearanceIxx GENERAL ANATOMY. of radiations. On its under side it gradually blends with the central white axis of the convolution, into Avhich its cells are scattered for some distance. ' The seventh layer is this central white stein or axis of the convolution. On every side it gives off bundles of fibres, which diverge in all directions, and in a fanlike manner towards the surface, through the several grey layers. As they pass between the elongated and radiating groups of cells in the inner grey layers, some of them become continuous with the pro- cesses of the cells in the same section or plane, but others bend round and run horizontally, both in a transverse and longitudinal direction (in re- ference to the course of the entire convolution), and with various degrees of obliquity. While the bundles themselves are by this means reduced in size, their component fibres become finer in proportion as they traverse the layers towards the surface, in consequence, apparently, of branches which they give off to be coniiected with cells in their course. Those which reach the outer grey layer are reduced to the finest dimensions, and form a close network, with which the nuclei and cells are in connection. ' Besides these fibres which diverge from the central white axis of the convolution, another set, springing from the same source, converge or rather curve inwards from opposite sides, to form arches along some of the grey layers. These arciform fibres run in different planes—^trans- versely, obliquely, and longitudinally—and appear to be partly continuous with those of the diverging set which bend round, as already stated, to follow a similar course. All these fibres establish an infinite number of communications in every direction, between different parts of each con- volution, between different convolutions, and between these and the central white substance.' Dr. Clarke then goes on to describe in detail the minuter differences which exist between the structure of the convolutions in different parts of the brain.* Spinal cord.—In the spinal cord, on the other hand, the grey matter i? entirely in the interior of the organ, and is collected together into one central mass, while the whole of the white matter is external, and is arranged into the various columns and commissures described at p. 464 et sqq. We shall here merely give an account of the intimate structure of the cord, which is condensed from the researches of Dr. Lockhart Clarke.t The white substance of the cord consists of transverse, oblique, and lon- gitudinal fibres, with blood-vessels and connective tissue. The transverse fihres proceed from the grey substance, and form withi: each other a kind of plexus between the bundles of longitudinal fibres,,! with which many are continuous ; while others reach the surface of the?! cord through fissures containing connective tissue. Within, the greyr substance they are continuous with the roots of the nerves, with the;: processes of the nerve-cells, and with the anterior and posterior com- missures. Ther oblique fibres proceed from the grey substance botl upwards and downwards : they form the deep strata of the white columu^^ and, after running a variable length, become superficial. The longitudinal • See Dr. Clarke's summary of liis researches on tliis subject iu Maudsley on the lony and Phymloijy of Mind, p. 60-63. „ „ ^ . . *f; . ,Sfi-> nnrf ii t PM. r/-flws., 1851-1853, part iii.; 1858, parti.; 1859, paft 1.; 1862, part u.SPINAL COED. Ixxi fibres are more superficial, run nearly parallel with each other, and form the greater portion of the white columns. The grey s^lbstance of the cord consists of, i. Nerve-fibres of variable, but smaller, average diameter than those of the columns; 2. nerve-cells of various shapes and sizes, with from two to eight processes; 3. blood- vessels and connective tissue. Each lateral half of the grey substance is divided into an anterior and posterior horn, and the tractus inter medio-lateralis, or lateral part of the grey substance between the anterior and posterior cornua. The posterior horn consists of two parts, the caput cornu, or expanded extremity of the horn (Fig. XXVIII.), round which is the lighter space or lamina, the gelatinous sub- Fig. XXVin.—Transverse section of the grey suh stance of the spinal cord, near the middle the dorsal region. Magnified 13 diameters. J. L. CiAKKE, del of Triii-2 latt stance and the cervix cornu, or remaining narrow portion of the horn, as far forwards as the central canal. The gelatinous substance contains along its border a series of large nerve-cells; but more internally consists of a stratum of small cells traversed by trans- verse, oblique, and longitudinal fibres. (Figs. XXIX. XXX.) Nearly the whole inner half of the cervix is occupied by a re- markable and important column of nerve-cells, called posterior vesicular Qolumn (Fig. XXVIII.), which varies in size and appear- ance in different regions of the cord, and is intimately connected with the posterior roots of the nerves. Within, and along the outer border of the cervix, are several thick bundles of longitudinal fibres, represented in Fig. XXVIII. by the dark spots; other bundles of the same kind may be seen in the grey substance along the line of junction of the caput with the cervix cornu. (Fig. XXIX.) The anterior horn of the grey substance in the cervical and lumbar swellings, where it gives origin to the nerves of the extremities, is much larger than in any other region, and contains several distinct groups of large and variously shaped cells. This is well shown on comparing the above figures. The tractus intervieddo-latercdis (Fig. XXVIII.) extends from the upper part of the lumbar'to the lower pai-t of the cervical enlargement, and con- sists of variously shaped cells, which are smaller than those of the anterior cornu. In the neck, above the cervical enlargement, a similar tract re- appears, and is traversed by the lower part of the spinal accessory nerve. Origin of the Spinal Nerves in the Cord.—The posterior roots are larger than the anterior; but their component filaments are finer and more delicate. They are all attached immediately to the posterior columns only, and decussate each other in all directions through the columns; but some of them pass through the grey substance into both the lateral andIxxii GENERAL ANATOMY.

Within the grey sub- stance they run longitudinally upwards and downwards; transversely through the posterior commissure to the opposite side; and into the anterior cornu of their own side. (Figs. XXIX. XXX.) The anterior roots are attached exclu- sively to the anterior column, or rather to the anterior part of the anterolateral columns; for there is no antero-lateral fissure dividing the anterior from the lateral column. Within the grey substance the fibrils cross each other, and diverge in aU directions, like the expanded hairs of a brush (Figs. XXIX. XXX.), some of them running more or less longitudinally upwards and downwards; and others decus- sating those of the opposite side through the anterior commissure in front of the central canal. All the fibres of both roots of the nerves proceed through the white columns into the grey substance, with, perhaps, the exception of some which appear to run longitudinally in the posterior cokmus; but whether these latter fibres of the Yi<y.

The Central Canal of the Spinal Cord.—In the .foetus until after the sixth mouth, a canal, continuous with the general ventricular cavity of the brain, extends throughout the entire length of the spinal cord, formed by the closing-in of a previously open groove. In the adult, this canal can only be seen at the upper part of the cord, extending from the point of the calamus scriptorius, in the floor of th^e fourth ventricle, for about half an inch down the centre of the cord, where it terminates in a ml de sac; the remnant of the canal being just visible in a section of the cord, as a small, pale spot, corresponding to the centre of the grey commissure: its cavity is lined with a layer of cylia- drical ciliated epithelium. In some cases, this canal remains pervious throughout the whole length of the cord. The Ganglia may be regarded as separate and independent nervous centres, of smaller size and less complex structure than the bi-ain, con- nected with each other, with the cerebro-spinal axis, and with the nerves in various situations. They are found on the posterior root of each of the spinal nerves; on the posterior or sensory root of the fifth cranial nerve; on the facial nerve; on the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves; in a connected series along each side of the vertebral column, forming the trunk of the sympathetic; on the branches of that nerve, and at the point of junction of those branches with the cerebro-spinal nerves. On section, they are seen to consist of a reddish grey substance, traversed by numerous white nerve-fibres: they vary considerably in form and size; the largest are found in the cavity of the abdomen; the smallest,, not visible with the naked eye, exist in considerable numbers upon the nerves distributed < to the difieerent viscera. The ganglia are invested by a smooth and firm \- closely-adhering membranous envelope, consisting of dense areolar tissue; [i this sheath is continuous with the neurilemma of the nerves, and sends ! numerous processes into the interior of the ganglion, Avhich support the blood-vessels supplying its substance. In structure, all ganglia are essentially similar, consisting of the same structural elements as the other nervous centres, viz., a coUection of vesiculoA-^ nervous matter, traversed by tubular and gelatinous nerv^-fihres. The vesicular nervous matter consists of nerve-ceUs or ganglion-glokles, most of which appear free, and of a round or oval form: these are more especially seated near the surface of the ganglion; others have caudate [ processes and give origin to nerve-fibres. In the ganglion, the nerve-cells . are usually enclosed in a capsule of granular corpuscles and fibres. The tubular nerve-fibres run through the ganglion, some being collected into i bundles, while others, separating from each other, take a circuitous course among the nerve-cells before leaving the ganglion. The Nerves are round or flattened cords, which are connected at one end with the cerebro-spinal centre or with the ganglia, and are distributed at tlie other to the various textures of the body: they are subdivided into two great classes, the cerebro-spinal, which proceed from the cerebro-Ixxiv GENERAL ANATOMY. spinal axis, and the sympathetic or ganglionic nerves, which proceed from the ganglia of the sympathetic. flH The Gerehro-spinal nerves consist of numerous nerve-fibres, collected together and enclosed in a membranous sheath. A small bundle of primitive fibres, enclosed in a tubular sheath, is called funiculus: if the nerve is of small size it may consist only of a single funiculus, but if large, the funiculi are coUected together into larger bundles or fasciculi; and are bound together in a common membranous investment, termed the sheath. In structure, the common sheath investing the whole nerve, as well as the septa given off from the sheath, and which separate the fasciculi, consist of areolar tissue, composed of white and yellow elastic fibres, the latter existing in greatest abundance. The tubular sheath of the funiculi, or neurilemma, consists of a fine, smooth, transparent mem- brane, which may be easily separated, in the form of a tube, from the fibres it encloses; in structure, it is, for the most part, a simple and homogeneous transparent film, occasionaUy composed of numerous mmute reticular fibres. . i The cerebro-spinal nerves consist almost exclusively of the tubular nerve-fibres, the gelatinous fibres existing in very small proportion. The blood-vessels supplying a nerve terminate in a minute capiUary plexus, the vessels composing which run, for the most part, paraUel with the funiculi; they are connected together by short transverse vessels, forming narrow oblong meshes, similar to the capillary system of muscle The nerve-fibres, as far as is at present known, do not coalesce, but pursue an uninterrupted course from the centre to the periphery. In separating a nerve, however, into its component funiculi, it may be seen that they do not pursue a perfectly insulated course, but occasionaUy join at a. very acute angle with other funiculi proceeding in the same direc- tion- from which again, branches are given off, to join agam m like manner with other funiculi. It must be remembered, however, that in these communications the nerve-fibres do not coalesce, but merely pass into the sheath of the adjacent nerve, become intermixed mth its nerve- fibres, and again pass on to become blended with the nerve-fibres m some "^t^IttSco^se, subdivide into branches, and these frequei^ly communiclte with branches of a neighbouring nerve. t^^;^— of a nerve, the filaments of which it is composed "^^'^^^^^^^ trunk into the branches, and at their junction with ^1^^ ^^'^l^f J' Sghbouring nerves the filaments pass to become intermixed with those of the other nerve in their further progress, in no instance, however, have the separate nerve-fibres been shown to inosculate.

Sometimes a Pl-^V^^^^^f'^^^^^^ primary branches of the trunks of the nerves, as the ^^^^^^^^^^^^'^ Lmbar'and sacral plexuses, and occasionaUy by Uie ^ermn-l ^--^^ in the plexuses formed at the V^^]?^ ^^^y^^ jIxxv THE NERVES. formation also of tlie smaller plexuses at tlie periphery of the hody, there is a free interchange of the fasciculi and primitive fibrils. In each case, however, the individual filaments remain separate and distinct, and do not inosculate with each other. It is probable that, through this interchange of fibres, the difiFerent branches passing off from a plexus have a more extensive connection ■with the spinal cord than if they each had proceeded to be distributed without such connection with other nerves. Consequently, the parts supplied by these nerves have naore extended relations with the nervous centres; by this means, also, groups of muscles may be associated for combined action. The Sympathetic nerve consists of tubular and gelatinous fibres, inter- mixed Avith a varying proportion of filamentous areolar tissue, and enclosed in a sheath formed of fibro-areolar tissue. The tubular fibres are, for the most part, smaller than those composing the cerebro-spinal nerves; their double contour is less distinct, and, according to Remak, they present nuclei similar to those found in the gelatinous nerve-fibres. Those branches of the sympathetic which present a well-marked grey colour, are composed more especially of gelatinous nerve-fibres, intermixed with a few tubular fibres; whilst those of a white colour contain more of the tubnlar fibres, and a few gelatinous. Occasionally, the grey and white cords run together in a single nerve, without any intermixture, as in the branches of communication between the sympathetic ganglia and the spinal nerves, or in the communicating cords between the ganglia. The nerve-fibres, both of the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic system, convey impressions of a two-fold kind. The sensory nerves, called also centripetal or afferent nerves, transmit to the nervous centres impressions made upon the peripheral extremities of the nerves, and in this way the mind, through the medium of the brain, becomes conscious of external objects. The motor nerves, called also centrifugal or efferent nerves, transmit impressions from the nervous centres to the parts to which the nerves are distributed, these impressions either exciting muscular contractions, or influencing the processes of nutrition, growth, and secretion. Terrninations of Nerves.—Bj the expression 'the termination of nerve- fibres ' is signified their connections with the nerve centres and with the parts which they supply. The former are called their central, the latter their peripheral terminations. With regard to the central terminations of the nerves, little is as yet certainly known.^ The nerve-cells, or nerve-corpuscles, above figured, have been regarded as the central origin of the fibres with which they are connected; and it is very probable that m many cases they are so. There are instances, however, in which such ceUs occur as mere nucleated swellings in the course of a nerve, and in these cases they obviously cannot be regarded as being in any sense the origins of the nerves. In other cases, as in the nerve-cells in the anterior horn of the grey matter of the cord, there are numerous pro- Max s'ctlTztspS o^-rvei. on this subject, S;S,T„\ScC' V^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ of a ,.e.tU of the..'Ixxvi GENERAI^ ANATOMY. cesses springing out of the cell; one of these (and according to Deiters one only) is recognised as an axis-cylinder; the others are fibrillse, which are continuous -with similar fibrilla) of which under high powers the apparently granular contents of the cell are found to be composed, and which appear therefore simply to run through the cell. The fibrillar may be, and probably are, primitive nervous fibrils, but they are so delicate that it has not as yet been found possible to ascertain their destination. With regard also to th£ axis-cylinder which is seen pro- ceeding out of the ganglionic corpuscle, although it is highly probable that it originates in that corpuscle, the fact has not been proved—nor has its relation to the nucleus of the corpuscle been demonstrated. In fine, all that is known on the subject is that many of the fibrillai and axis- cylinders can be shown either to originate in or to pass through ganglionic corpuscles (or nerve-cells), and other nerves can be shown to contain such nerve-cells in their interior at certain parts of their course. But whether in the case of such connection in one of the central organs the cell is to be reo-arded as the origin of the nervous fibril, or whether the fibril merely pa'sses through the cell (as some observers believe), just in the same manner as nerves pass through ganglia, has not been determined. If the latter view be correct, it may be that nerves have really no central termination, but thatiheir fibrils start from their peripheral distribution, travel to the nervous centre, are there brought into connection with the nerve-ceUs, and thence return to their distribution. However, in the present state^ of anatomical knowledge, the more probable opinion seems to be that which is usually entertained; viz., that each nerve-fibre is connected somewhere with a ganglionic corpuscle which is to be regarded as its central termi- nation or origin. Dr. Beale asserts that even in those ganglion-ceUs, which appear either altogether destitute of processes, or unipolar, numerous fibres can be seen proceeding out of them if the proper reagents be used and very high powers employed. The peripheral connections, or terminations of the nerve-fibres, are somewhat more easy to ascertain, though even as to these a great difference exists with respect to minute details... They are usuaUy and naturaUy studied in the sensory and motor nerves separately. Sensory nerves sometimes terminate in minute plexuses m the subcuta- neous or submucous areolar tissue. Dr. Sharpey says that he has seen the ultimate fibres of these minute plexuses come into close contact with the connective-tissue corpuscles, but has not been able to trace any distinct connection between them. The white substance of Schwann and the tubular sheath usually dis- appear as the nerve approaches its termination, leaving only the axis- cylinder invested by its proper basement-membrane, on which nuclei can be seen at intervals, and in many cases the axis-cylinder itself breaks up into the primitive fibrils. In some parts, however, the fibres appear to be Bnclosed up to their termination in a sheath which is either a prolongation of the neurilemma, or a continuation of the tubular membrane. The differences of opinion prevaUing on the question of the ultimate distribu- tion of the nerve-fibres depend on their extreme delicacy aawl the conse- nuent great difficulty of following individual fibres in continuity. Hence St some obsei-vers describe as a free end in which the nerve t..'minates,Ixxvii THE NERVES. others regard as merely a bending of the fibre wliere it becomes lost to sight, or a spot where it is lost sight of in consequence of the power used being too low, or from difficulty in focussing. These ultimate fibres, it should be remembered, are structureless, and can therefore only be recognised positively as nervous by their continuity with a nerve of more complex structure. In the papillae of the skin, or mucous membrane, and on the surface of various membranes (conjunctiva, mesentery, &c.), three different kinds of terminal organs have been found connected with the nerves, viz., the end- bulbs of Krause, the tactile corpuscles of Eudolph Wagner, and the Pacinian corpuscles. The end-bulbs of Krause are small capsules of connective tissue, in which nuclei can be detected by reagents, and in which one or moi-e nerve-fibrils terminate either in a coiled plexiform mass or in a bulbous extremity. They have been described as occurring in the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the mouth, and the surface of the glans penis and glans clitoridis.* The tactile corpuscles of Wagner (Fig. XXXI.) are described by him as oval-shaped bodies, made up of superimposed saccular laminae, presenting some resemblance to a miniature fir-cone, and he regarded them as directly concerned in the sense of touch. Kolliker considers that the central part of the papillse generally consists of a connective tissue more homogeneous than that of the outer part, surrounded by a sort of sheath of elastic fibres, and he believes that these corpuscles are merely a variety of this structure. The nerve-fibres, according to this observer, run up in a waving course to the corpuscle, not penetrating it, but forming two or three coils round it, and finally join together in loops. These bodies are not found in all the papillse; but, from their existence in those parts in which tKe skin is highly sensitive, it is probable that they are specially concerned in the sense of touch, though their absence from the papillte of other tactile parts shows that they are not essential to this sense. The Pacinian corpuscles f (Fig. XXXII.) are found in the human subject chiefly on the nerves of the fingers and toes, lying in the subcutaneous cellular tissue: but they have also been described by Eauber as connected with the nerves of the joints, and with the nerves lying between many of the muscles of the trunk and limbs. Each of these corpuscles is attached to and encloses the termination of a single nerve. The corpuscle, which IS perfectly visible to the naked eye (and which can be most easily demon- strated m the mesentery of a cat), consists of a number of concentric iayei-s of cellular tissue, between which Todd and Bowman have fic^iired capillary vessels as running. The nerve, at its entrance into this body, parts with Its white substance, and the axis-cylinder runs forwards in a kmd of cavity m the centre of the corpuscle to terminate in a rounded end or knob, sometimes bifurcating previously, in which case each branch has a similar termination. Grandry, who has examined these corpuscles with very high magnifying powers, describes the axis-cylinder as exhibiting a very weU marked fibrillar structure, and the bulbous end as consisting of a mass of granules mto which the fibrils run, diverging as they a,pproach it. T Ulten called in German anatonucal works ' corpuscles of Vater.'Ixxviii GENERAL ANATOMY. The investing capsules are from thirty to sixty in number, the outer being more separated from each other, as if by a clear fluid, while the inner are closely applied together. Schultze calls attention to the striking re- semblance in all essential particulars between these corpuscles andKrause's end-bulbs above described.* Fig. XXXI.—A, Side -piew of a papilla of the hand, a, cortical layer; h, tactile cor- puscle, with transverse nuclei; c, small nerve of the papilla, with neurilemma d, its two nervous fibres running with spiral coils around the tactile corpuscles ; e, ap- parent termination of one of these fibres.

These cells he has denominated ' olfactory cells ;' and similar cells have been described by Axel Key, Schwalbe, and Loven, in the papillse circumvallatse of man, and the fungiform papillae of the frog ('taste-cells'). The fibres also of the optic nerve have, according to Schultze, a similar connection with the cells (' sight cells') of the retina; and cells somewhat similar, and connected with processes that pass through the epithelium, are to be found on the nerve fibrils of the auditory nerve, in the membranous labyrinth (' hearing- cells '). The terminations of the nerves in the hair-bulbs is probably to be found in the papillae at their root, as is also the case in the teeth. In glands the nerves, according to Pfliiger, are connected with the ceecal commencements of the gland-tubes—at least he has described this arrangement in the salivary glands, and thus he is led to regard the nuclei ■ of these caecal pouches as the terminations of the nerves. Motor nerres are to be traced either into unstriped or striped fibx'es. j In the unstriped fibres it uppears from the researches of Beale, Tran- ' tenhauser and Julius Arnold, that the ultimate fibrils of the nerves form plexuses at the junctions of whose branches small nuclear bodies are situated: These nuclei are regarded by Arnold as the real terminations ' of the nerves, for although he agrees with Prankenhauser in stating that the : nervous filaments penetrate the muscular fibres, and enter into relation with the granular contents of their nuclei, he traces the filaments back again from that point to the nuclei situated at the junctions of the nervous plexuses, in the connective tissue of the muscular fibres. In the voluntary muscles Beale and KoUiker have described the nerve- fibres as terminating either in a plexiform arrangement, or (according to the latter author), sometimes in free ends between the muscular fibres external to the sarcolemma. Lately another method of termination, which had been formerly described, has received the support of numerous eminent authorities—viz., the ' motorial end-plates ' of Kiihne, or 'nerve- hillocks ' (nerve-tufts) of Doyere. I The latter author had described, nearly thirty years ago, a connection between the nervous and muscular fibres in some of the lower animals consisting m an elevation at the point of junction of the two, where the sarcolemma of the muscular fibre became blended with the tubular membrane of the nerve.

This nerve-end-plate is sometimes more like a membrane, at others like a system of fibres.

THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. The Vascular System, exclusive of its central organ, the Heart, Is divided into four classes of vessels-the Arteries, Capillaries, Veins, and Lymphatics—the mmute structure of which we will now proceed briefly to describe, referring the reader to the body of the work for aU that is necessary m the details of their ordinary anatomy. Structure of Arteries.-The arteries are composed of three coats : internal serous or epithelial coat {tunica intima of Kolliker), middle ibrous ovczrcular coat, and external cellular coat, or tunica adventitia. ^ The two inner coats together are very easily separated from the external, as by the ordinary operation of tying a ligature on the artery. ti, .

Ixxxii the internal coats are divided in the trade of the ligature and can easily be further dissected from the outer coat. The inner coat can be separated from the middle by a little maceration. The inner coat consists of—i. a layer of pavement-epithelium, the cells of which are oval or fusiform, and have very distinct nuclei. 2. This epithelium rests upon a layer of longitudinal elastic fibres, in which, under the microscope, small elongated apertures are seen, and which was therefore called by Henle the fenestrated membrane. This layer is marked with numerous reticulations; it is perfectly smooth when the artery is distended ; but when empty, presents longitudinal and transverse folds. The fenestrated membrane can often be separated into more than one layer. In arteries of less than a line in diameter, the internal coat consists of two layers, as above described; but in middle-sized arteries, several Fig. XXXV.—An artery from the mesentery of a child, -062'", and h, vein ;o67'", in dia- meter, treated with acetic acid and magnitied 350 times, a, Tunica adventitia, with elon- gated nuclei. /3, Nuclei of the contractile fibre-cells of the tunica media,_8een partly from the surface, partly apparent in transverse section. 7, Nuclei of the epithelial cells. 5, Elastic longitudinal fibrous coat. lamellEe, composed of elastic fibres and connective tissue, are interposed between the epithelial and middle coats. In the largest ai-teries, the inner coat is usually much thickened, especially in the aorta; and consists of a homogeneous substance, occasionally striated or fibriUated, traversed by longitudinal elastic networks, which are very fine in the lamellae immediately beneath the epithelium, but increase in thickness hom within outwards. The internal and middle coats are separated by either a dense elastic reticulated coat, or a true fenestrated membrane. The middle coat is distinguished from the inner by its colour, and by the transverse arrangement of its fibres, in contradistinction to the longi- tudinal direction of those of the inner coat. In the largest arteries, this coat is of great thickness, of a yellow colour, and highly elastic; it diminishes in thickness and becomes redder in colour as the arteries become smaller; becomes very thin, and finally disappears. In small arteries this coat is purely muscular, consisting of muscular fibre-cellsTHE ARTERIES. Ixxxiii united to form lamellse which vary in number according to the size of the artery, the very smaU arteries having only a single layer, and those not larger than the -^th of a line in diameter, three or four layers. In arteries of medium size, this coat becomes thicker in proportion to the size of the vessel; its layers of muscular tissue are more numerous, and intermixed with numerous fine elastic fibres which unite to form broad- meshed networks. In the larger vessels, as the femoral, superior mesen- teric, cceliac, external iliac, brachial, and popliteal arteries, the elastic fibres unite to form lamellse, which alternate with the layers of muscular fibre. In the largest arteries, the muscular tissue is only slightly de- veloped, and forms about one-third or one-fourth of the whole substance of the middle coat; this is especially the case in the aorta, and trunk ot the pulmonary artery, in which the individual cells of the muscular layer are imperfectly formed; while, in the carotid, axillary, iliac, and sub- clavian arteries, the muscular tissue of the middle coat is more developed. The elastic lamellse are well marked, may amount to fifty or sixty in i number, and alternate regularly with the layers of muscular fibre. They are most distinct, and arranged with most regularity in the abdominal aorta, innominate artery, and common carotid. The external coat consists mainly of connective tissue, and contains elastic fibres in all but the smallest arteries. In the largest vessels, the external coat is relatively thin; but in small arteries, it is as thick, or thicker, than the middle coat. In arteries of the medium size, and above r it, the external coat is formed of two layers, the outer of which consists of connective tissue, containing an irregular elastic network, while the inner is composed of elastic tissue only. The inner elastic layer is very distinct in the carotid, femoral, brachial, profunda, mesenteric and cceliac arteries, the elastic fibres being often arranged in lamellse. In the smaller arteries, the former layer of mixed connective tissue and elastic fibres composes the whole of the external tunic; while in the smallest arteries just above the capillaries, the elastic fibres are wanting, and the con- nective tissiie of which the coat is composed becomes more homogeneous the nearer it approaches the capillaries, and is gradually reduced to a thin membranous envelope, which finally disappears. Some arteries have extremely thin coats in proportion to their size; this is especially the case in those situated in the cavity of the cranium and spinal canal, the difference depending on the greater thinness of the external and middle coats. The arteries, in their distribution throughout the body, are included in a thin areolo-fibrous investment, which forms what is called their sheath. In the limbs, this is usually formed by a prolongation of the deep fascia; in the upper part of the thigh, it consists of a continuation downwards of the transversalis and iliac fascise of the abdomen; in the neck, of a prolongation of the deep cervical fascia. The included vessel is loosely connected with its sheath by a delicate areolar tissue; and the sheath ■QsuaUy encloses the accompanying veins, and sometimes a nerve. Some arteries, as those in the cranium, are not included in sheaths. All the larger arteries are supplied with blood-vessels like the other organs of the body; they are called vasa vasorum. These nutrient vessels arise from a branch of the artery or from a neighbouring vessel, u 2Ixxxiv GENERAL ANATOMY. at some considerable distance from the point at which they are distributed; they ramify in the loose areolar tissue connecting the artery with its sheath, and are distributed to the external and middle coats, and, according to Arnold and others, supply the internal coat. Minute veins serve to return the blood from these vessels; they empty themselves into the vena comites in connection with the artery. Arteries are also provided with nerves, which are derived chiefly from the sympathetic, but partly from the cerebro-spinal system. They form intricate plexuses upon the surfaces of the larger trunks, the smaller branches being usually accompanied by single filaments; their exact mode of distribution is unknown. According to KoUiker, the majority of the arteries of the brain and spinal cord, those of the choroid and of the placenta, as well as many arteries of muscles, glands, and membranes, are unprovided with nerves. TU Capillaries.-The smaller arterial branches (excepting those of the cavernous structures of the sexual organs, and in the uterine placenta), terminate in a network of vessels which pervade nearly every tissue of the body. These vessels, from their minute size, are termed capillaries {capillus, 'a hair'). They are interposed between the smaUest branches of the arteries and the commencing veins, constituting a network, the branches of which maintain the same diameter throughout, the meshes of the network being more uniform in shape and size than those formed by the anastomoses of the small arteries and veins. The diameter of the capiUaries varies in the different tissues of the body, their nsual size being about of an inch. The smaUest are those of the brain, and the mucous membrane of the mtestines; the largest, those of the skin, and the marrow of bones. _ _ The form of the capillary net varies in the different tissues, being modifications chiefly of rounded or elongated meshes. The rounded form of mesh is most common, and prevails where there is a dense network as in the lungs, in most glands and mucous membranes, and m the cutis; the meshes being more or less angular, sometimes nearly quadrangular or polygonal; more frequently, irregular. Elongated meshes^ve observed in the bundles of fibres and tubes composing muscles and nerves, the meshes being usually of a paraUelogram form, the long axis of the mesh running paraHel wiJh the long axis of the nerve or fibre. .So-etinie the capillaries have a looped arrangement, a smgle vessel projecting from the common network, and returning after forming one or more loops, as in the papillse of the tongue and skin. The number of the capiUaries, and the size of the meshes determines the degree of vascularity of a part. The closest ^''^J^^. smallest interspaces, are found in the lungs and m the choroid coat of the eye. In the liver and lung, the interspaces are smaller than the capillary vessels themselves. In the Iddney, in the conjunctiva, and m the cutis, the interspaces are from three to four times as large as the capiUaries which form them ; and in the brain from eight to ten t— large as the capiUaries, in their long diameter, and from four to s x tiLes as large in their transverse diameter. In the ceUular coat of the arteries the width of the meshes is ten times that of the capiUaryTHE CAPILLARIES. JXXXV vessels. As a general rule, the more active the function of an organ is, the closer is its capillary net, and the larger its supply of blood, the network being very narrow in all growing parts, in the glands, and in the mucous membranes; wider in bones and ligaments, which are com- paratively inactive; and nearly altog«>ther absent in tendons and carti- lages, in which very little organic change occurs after their formation. Structure.—The walls of the capillaries consist of a fine, transparent, homogeneous membrane, in which are embedded, at intervals, minute oval corpuscles, probably the remains of the nuclei of the cells from which the vessel was originally formed. In the largest capillaries (which ought perhaps to be described rather as the smallest arteries) traces of an epithelial lining, and of circular transverse fibres, are to be seen. Veins are composed of three coats, internal, middle, and external, as the arteries are; and these coats are, with the necessary modifications, Fig. XXXVI.—Finest vessels on the arte- rial side.

Tlie main differences between the veins and the arteries is in the comparative weakness of the middle coat of the former j and to this it is due that theIxxxvi GENERAL ANATOMY. veins do not stand open when divided, as the arteries do; and that they are passive rather than active organs of the circulation. In the veins immediately above the capillaries, the three coats are hardly to be distinguished. The epithelium is supported on an outer membrane of nucleated connective tissue, separable into two layers, the outer of which is the thicker, the fibres of both being longitudinal. The interior thinner layer of nucleated tissue is regarded by Kolliker as the analogue of the middle coat. In the veins next above these in size (one- fifth of a line, according to Kolliker) a muscular layer and a layer of circular fibres can be traced, forming the middle coat, while the elastic and connective elements of the outer coat become more distinctly per- "^^^ In the middle-sized veins, the typical structure of these vessels becomes clear. The epithelium is of the same character as in the arteries, but its cells are more oval, less fusiform. It is supported by one or more layers of nucleated fibrous tissue, arranged longitudinaUy, and external to this is a layer of elastic fibrous tissue. This constitutes the internal coat. The middle coat is composed of a thick inner layer of connective tissue with elastic fibres, having intermixed in some veins a transverse layer ot muscular fibres; and J^n outer layer consisting of longitudinal elastic lamellse, varying from five to ten in number, alternating with layers ot transverse muscular fibres and connective tissue, v^hich resembles some- what in structure the middle coat of large arteries. The outer coat is similar in all essential respects to that of the arteries. In the large veins, as in the commencement of the vena ports, m the upper part of the abdominal portion of the inferior vena cava, and m the laro-e hepatic trunks within the liver, the middle coat is thick, and its structure similar to that of the middle coat in medium-sized veins; but its muscTilar tissue is scanty, and the longitudinal elastic networks less distinctly lamellated. The muscular tissue of this coat is best marked in the splenic and portal veins; it is absent in certain parts of the vena cava below the liver, and wanting in the subclavian vein and termmal parts of the two cavse. , „ 4.1-1 ^„ In the largest veins, the outer coat is from two to five times thickei than the middle coat, and contains a large number of longitudinal mus- cular fibres. This is most distinct in the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava, and at the termination of this vein in the heart; m the trunks of the hepatic veins; in all the large trunks of the vena ports; m the splenic, superior mesenteric, external iliac, renal, and azygos veins Where the middle coat is absent, this muscular layer extends as far as the inner coat. In the renal and portal veins, it extends through tliej^hole thickness of the outer coat; but in the other vems mentioned, a layer of connective and elastic tissues is found external to the musculai fib es AH the large veins which open into the heart are covered for a shoit distance by a layer of striped muscular tissue contmued on to them from the ^'^Muscular tissue is wanting in theveins-i.

In the venous spaces of the corpora cavernosa, ihe vemsIxxxvii THE LYMPHATICS. the above-mentioned parts consist of an internal epithelial lining, sup- ported on one or more layers of areolar tissue. Most veins are provided with valves, which serve to prevent the reflux of the blood. They are formed by a reduplication of the middle and inner coats, and consist of connective tissue and elastic fibres, covered on both surfaces by epithelium; their form is semilunar. They are attached by their convex edge to the wall of the vein; the concave margin is free, directed in the course of the venous current, and lies in close apposition with the waU of the vein as long as the ciu-rent of blood takes its natural course; if, however, any regurgitation takes place, the valves become distended, their opposed edges are brought into contact, and the current is intercepted. Most commonly two such valves are found, placed oppo- site one another, more especiaUy in the smaller veins, or in the larger trunks at the point where they are joined by small branches; occasionally, there are three, and sometimes only one. The wall of the vein im- mediately above the point of attachment of each segment of the valve, is expanded into a pouch or sinus, which gives to the vessel, when injected or distended with blood, a knotted appearance. The valves are very numerous in the veins of the extremities, especially of the lower extremities, these vessels having to conduct the blood against the force of gravity. They are absent in the very small veins, also in the vense cavse, the hepatic vein, portal vein and its branches, the renal, uterine, and ovarian veins. A few valves are found in the spermatic veins, and one also at their point of junction with the renal vein and inferior cava in both sexes. The cerebral and spinal veins, the veins of the cancellated tissue of bone, the pulmonary veins, and the umbilical vein and its branches, are also desti- tute of valves. They are occasionally found, few in niimber, in the vense azygos and intercostal veins. The veins are supplied with nutrient vessels, vasa vasorum, like the arteries; but nerves are not generally found distributed upon them. The only vessels upon which they have at present been traced, are the sinuses of the dura mater; on the spinal veins; on the vense cavse; on the common jugular, iliac, and crural veins; and on the hepatic veins (KoUiker). The lymphatic vessels, like arteries and veins, are composed of three coats. The internal is an epithelial and elastic coat. It is thin, trans- parent, slightly elastic, and ruptures sooner than the other coats. It is composed of a layer of elongated epithelial cells, supported on a simple network of elastic fibres. The middle coat is composed of, smooth muscular and fine elastic fibres, disposed in a transverse direction. The external, or areolar-fibrous coat, consists of filaments of the areolar tissue, intermixed with smooth muscular fibres, longitudinally or obliquely disposed. It forms a protective covering to the other coats, and serves to connect the vessel with the neighbouring structures. The lymphatics are suppHed by nutrient vessels, which are distributed to their outer and middle coats; but no nerves have at present been traced into them. The lymphatics are very generally provided with valves, which assist materially in effecting the circulation of the fluid they contain. TheseIxxxviii GENERAL ANATOMY. valves are formed of a thin layer of fibrous tissue, lined on both surfaces with scaly epithelium. Their form is semilunar, they are attached by their convex edge to the sides of the vessel, the concave edge being free, and directed along the course of the contained current.

The valves in the lymphatic vessels are placed at much shorter intervals than in the veins. They are most numerous near the lymphatic glands, and they are found more frequently in the lymphatics of the neck and upper extremity, than in the lower. The waU of the lymphatics, imme- diately above the point of attachment of each segment of a valve, is expanded into a pouch or sinus, which gives to these vessels, when distended, the knotted or beaded appearances which they present. Valves are wanting in the vessels composing the plexiform network in which the lymphatics usually originate on the surface of the body. Besides this plexiform commencement, however, there are other modes of origin of the lymphatics, for those of the intestinal villi arise sometimes by closed extremities; and the lymphatics which arise in the interior of the organs (as in the glands to be presently described) originate in iii-egular spaces, lymph-sinuses, or lacunee. There is no satisfactory evidence to prove that any natural communica- tion exists between the lymphatics of glandular organs and their ducts, or between the lymphatics and the capillary vessels. With respect to the structure of the lymphatic glands, there are some points which are certain, while others must be allowed to be doubtful. It is certain that a number of vessels enter them at various pomts ot their circumference {afferent vessels), and that one or two vessels leave them [efferent vessels), usually at a definite spot, the hilum. Further, that the external coats of these vessels are continuous with an envelope ot fibrous tissue, which constitutes the capsule of the gland, and that aU parts of the gland are freely supplied with capillary blood-vessels. The intimate structure, however, of the gland, is a matter of some doubt, in the original edition of this work, the description of Hewson was adopted.Ixxxix THE SKIN. according to which the afferent vessels break up into a plexus of smaller vessels and these re-unite to form the efferent vessels, so that the afferent and efferent lymphatics are directly continuous. Some observers added to this description, that there were a number of minute dotted corpuscles lyin- between the meshes of the network of vessels in the interior of the gland, and grouped in cells like the acini of secreting glands. But the description given by His and KoUiker, and which has been adopted by Dr. Sharpey, makes the structure more complex than this. It is, in brief, as foUows :—Passing inwards from the capsule of the gland are a number of septa or trabeculee, fibrous in man, muscular m some of the lower animals, which separate the outer or cortical portion of the gland into alveoli. The afferent vessels break up and open into these alveoli, much in the same way that the splenic capillaries open into the pulp of that organ. The alveoli contain a greyish-white pulp, consisting, according to Kolliker, of the minutest ramifications of fibrous tissue, and of a juice, containing round cells identical with those of the chyle or lymph. The interior of the gland {medullary portion) is formed of a number of vascular channels (together with capillaries and connective tissue), which are the radicles of the efferent vessels, and converge to the hilum. The cortical portion is usually deficient at the hilum, where the medullary tissue of the gland passes directly into the efferent channels. The afferent lymphatics, after passing at various points through the capsule, break up in the septa between the alveoli into their terminal ramifications; and here, as EoUiker supposes, they open into those spaces just as the arteries of erectile tissue do into the cavernous spaces of which that tissue is composed. From the walls of the alveoli lymphatic channels can again be traced, which are the radicles of the efferent vessels, and accompany the arterial branches. The gland-pulp does not completely fill the alveoli of the cortical, nor the vascular channels of the medullary portion, but leaves a space, visible in sections from which the lymph-corpuscles have been washed away. This space is called the lymph-sinus; but it seems to be distinguished from the rest of the alveolus merely by a less close arrangement of the con- nective tissue, through which the lymph circulates. Dr. Sharpey describes the lymph-sinus as lined throughout by a layer of pavement- epithelium similar to that of the lymphatic vessels with which it is continuous. The arteries and veins pass into and out of the gland at the hilum, and Kolliker has described some fine nervous filaments, as accompanying them. THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. The Skin is the principal seat of the sense of touch, and may be regarded as a covering for the protection of the deeper tissues; it is also an important excretory and absorbing organ. It consists of two layers, the derma or cutis vera, and the epidermis or cuticle. On the surface of the former layer are the sensitive papillse; and within, or embedded beneath it, are the sweat-glands, hair-follicles, and sebaceous glands.GENERAL ANATOMY. xc The derma, or inoe sldn, is tougli, flexible, and liighly elastic, in order to defend the internal parts from violence. It consists of fibro-areolar tissue, intermixed with numerous blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The fibro-areolar tissue forms the frame-work of the cutis; it is composed of firm interlacing bundles of white fibrous tissue, intermixed with a much smaller proportion of yellow elastic fibres, the amount of which varies in different pa,rts. The fibro-areolar tissue is more abmidant in the Fig. XXXIX. -A Sectional View of the Skin (magnified).

Thus, it is thicker m the more exposed regions, as the palm of the hand and sole of the foot; on the posterior aspect of the body, than the front; and on the outer, than the inner side of the limbs. In the eyelids, scrotum, and penis, it is exceedingly thin and delicate. The skin generally is thicker in the male than in the female. , . « n. i i The areolce are occupied by adipose tissue, hair-foUicles, and the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands; they are the channels by which the vessels and nerves are distributed to the more superficial strata ot the corium, and to the papillary layer. Unstriped muscular fibres are found in the superficial layers ot the corium, wherever hairs are found; and in the subcutaneous areolar tissue of the scrotum, penis, perinseum, and areola of the nipple. In the latter situations the fibres are arranged in bands, closely reticulated, and disposed in superimposed laminae. The papillary layer is situated upon the free surface of the corium; it consists of numerous small, highly sensitive, and vascular eminences, the papillEe, which rise perpendicularly from its surface, and form the essential element of the organ of touch. The papillae are conical-shaped eminences, having a round or blunted extremity, occasionally divided into two or more parts, and connected by their base with the free surface of the corium. Their average length is about j^^th of an inch, and they measure at their base about ■^Vo^'^ of an inch in diameter. On the general surface of the body, more especially in those parts which are endowed with slight sensibility, they are few in number, short, ex- ceedingly minute, and irregularly scattered over the surface; but in other situations, as upon the palmar surface of the hands and fingers, upon the plantar surface of the feet and toes, and around the nipple, they are long, of large size, closely aggregated together, and arranged in parallel curved lines, forming the elevated ridges seen on the free surface of the epidermis. In these ridges, the larger papillae are arranged in a double row, with smaller papillae between them; and these rows are sub- divided into small square-shaped masses by short transverse furrows, regularly disposed, in the centre of each of which is the minute orifice of the duct of a sweat-gland. No papillae exist in the grooves between the ridges. In structure, the papillae resemble the superficial layer of the cutis; consisting of a homogeneous tissue, faintly fibrillated, and con- taining a few fine elastic fibres. The smaller papillae contain a single capillary loop ; but in the larger the vessels are convoluted to a greater or less degree : each papilla also contains one or more nerve-fibres, but the mode in which these terminate is uncertain. In those parts in which the sense of touch is highly developed, as in the lips and palm of the hand, the nerve-fibres are connected with the 'tactile corpuscles.' Kolliker considers that the central part of the papillae generally consists of a connective tissue more homogeneous than that of the outer part, sur- rounded by a sort of sheath of elastic fibres, and he believes that thesexcii GENERAL ANATOMY. corpuscles are merely a variety of this structure. The corpuscles, and their connection with the nerves, have been described above. The epidermis, or cuticle (scarf skin), is an epithelial structure, ac- curately moulded on the papillary layer of the derma. It forms a defensive covering to the surface of the true skin, and limits the evaporation of watery vapour from its free surface. It varies in thickness in different parts. Where it is exposed to pressure and the influence of the atmosphere, as upon the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, it is thick, hard, and horny in texture ; whilst that which lies in contact with the rest of the body, is soft and cellular in structure. The deeper and softer layers have been called the rete mucosum, the term rete being used from the deepest layers presenting, when isolated, numerous depres- sions, or complete apertures, which have been occupied by the projecting papillse. The free surface of the epidermis is marked by a net-work of linear furrows of variable size, marking out the surface into a number of spaces of polygonal or lozenge-shaped form. Some of these furrows are large, as opposite the flexures of the joints, and correspond to the folds in the derma produced by their movements. In other situations, as upon the back of the hand, they are exceedingly fine, and intersect one another at various angles : upon the palmar surface of the hand and fingers, and upon the sole, these lines are very distinct, and are disposed in curves. They depend upon the large size and peculiar arrangement of the papillse upon which the epidermis is placed. The deep surface of the epidermis is accurately moulded upon the papillary layer of the derma, each papiUa being invested by its epidermic sheath; so that when this layer is removed by maceration, it presents a number of pits or depressions corresponding to the elevations of the papilla, as well as the furrows left in the intervals between them. Fine tubular prolongations from this layor are continued into the ducts of the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands. In structure, the epidermis consists of flattened cells, agglutinated to- gether, and having a laminated arrangement. In the deeper layers the cells are large, rounded or columnar, and filled with soft opaque contents In the superficial layers the cells are flattened, transparent, dry, and firm, and their contents converted into a kind of horny matter. The difference in the structure of these layers is dependent upon the mode ot growth of the epidermis. As the external layers desquamate, from their being constantly subjected to attrition, they are reproduced from beneath, successive layers gradually approaching towards the free surface, which, m their turn, die and are cast off. , . , . ;i t- These ceUs are developed in the liquor sanguinis, which is poured out on the free surface of the derma; they contain nuclei, and form a thin stratum of closely-aggregated nucleated cells, which cover the entire extent of the papillary layer. The deepest layers of ceUs, according to Kolliker, are of a columnar form, and are arranged perpendicularly to the free surface of the derma, forming either a single or a double, or even triple, layer; the laminte succeeding these are composed of ceils ot a more rounded form, the contents of which are soft, opaque, granular, and soluble in acetic acid. As these cells successively approach ^^^^ by the development of fresh layers from beneath, they assume a flattened.THE SKIN. xciii form from the evaporation of their fluid contents, and finally form a i transparent, dry, membranous scale, lose their nuclei, and apparently , become changed in their chemical composition, as they are unaffected now ! by acetic acid. The black colour of the skin in the negro, and the tawny colour among some of the white races, is due to the presence of pigment in the ceUs of u the cuticle. This pigment is more especially distinct in the cells of the I deeper layer, or rete mucosum, and is similar to that found in the choroid. As the cells approach the surface and desiccate, the colour becomes partially lost. The arteries which supply the skin divide into numerous branches in I the subcutaneous tissue; they then pass through the areote of the corium, i and divide into a dense capillary plexus, which supplies the sudoriferous i and sebaceous glands and the hair-follicles, terminating in the superficial layers of the corium, by forming a capillary network, from which numerous fine branches ascend to the papillse. j The lymphatic vessels are arranged in a minute plexiform network in the superficial layers of the corium, where they become interwoven with the capillary and nervous plexuses ; they are especially abundant in the scrotum and around the nipple. The nerves which supply the skin ascend with the vessels through the areolae of the deep layers of the corium to the more superficial layers, where they form a minute plexiform mesh. From this plexus, the primitive nerve-fibres pass to be distributed to the papillae. The nerves are most numerous in those parts which are provided with the greatest sensibihty. The appendages of the skin are, the nails, the hairs, the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands, and their ducts. The nails and hairs are peculiar modifications of the epidermis, con- sisting essentially of the same cellular structure as that membrane. The Nails are flattened elastic structures of a horny texture, placed upon the dorsal surface of the terminal phalanges of the fingers and toes. Each nail is convex on its outer surface, concave within, and is implanted ( by a portion called the^root into a groove of the skin ; the exposed portion is called the body, and the anterior extremity the free edge. The nail has a very firm adhesion to the cutis, being accurately moulded upon its sui'- face as the epidermis is in other parts. The part of the cutis beneath the body and root of the nail, is called the matrix, because it is the part from which the nail is produced. Corresponding to the body of the nail, the matrix is thick, and covered with large, highly vascular papillse, arranged in longitudinal rows, the colour of which is seen through the transparent tissue. Behind this, near the root of the nail, the papillse are small, less vascular, and have no regular arrangement; hence, the portion of the nail corresponding to this part is of a whiter colour, and called lumda, from its form. The cuticle, as it passes forwards on the dorsal surface of the finger, is attached to the surface of the nail, a little in advance of its root: at the extremity of the finger, it is connected with the under surface of the nail, a little behind its free edge. The cuticle and horny structure of the nail (both epidermic structures), are thus directly continuous with each other.xciv GENERAL ANATOMY. The nails, in structure, consist of cells having a laminated arrangement, and these are essentially similar to those composing the epidermis. The deepest layer of cells which lie in contact with the papiUaj at the root and under surface of the nail, are of elongated form, an-anged perpendicularly to the surface, and provided with nuclei; those which succeed these are of a rounded or polygonal form, the more superficial ones becoming broad, thin, and flattened, and so closely compacted together as to make the limits of each cell very indistinct. It is by the successive growth of new cells at the root and under surface of the body of the nail, that it advances forwards, and maintains a due thickness, whilst, at the same time, the growth of the nail m the proper direction is secured. As these ceUs in their turn become displaced by the oTowth of new cells, they assume a flattened form, lose their nuclei, and finally become closely compacted together into a firm, dense, horny texture. In chemical composition, the nails resemble the epidermis. Accordmg to Mulder, they contain a somewhat larger porportion of carbon and sulphur. . . , The Hairs are peculiar modifications of the epidermis, and consist essentially of the same structure as that membrane. They are ^onni^ nearly every part of the surface of the body, excepting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and vary much in length, thickness and colour in different parts of the body and in different races of mankmd. In some parts they are so short as not to project beyond the foUicles contannng them : in other parts, as upon the scalp, they are of considerable length ; along the margin of the eyelids and upon the face, they are remarkab e for their thickness. A hair consists of a root, the part implanted m the skin; the shaft, the portion projecting from its surface, and the pomt. They generally present a cylindrical or more or less flattened form, and a reniform outline upon a transverse section. The root of the hair presents at its extremity a bulbous enlargement, ^hichis whiter in colour, and softer in texture, than the «tem, and is Todced in a follicular involution of the epidermis, called the ha^r.foll^cle. When the hair is of considerable length, the follicle extends into the sub- ItaneousceUulartissue. The halr-foUicle is bulbous a its d^^^^^^^ like the hair which it contains, and has opening into it, near its tree etiWy 1 orifices of the ducts of one or more sebaceous glands.

The root of the hair rests upon this conical-shaped eminence, and is continuous with the cuticular lining i of the follicle at this part. It consists of nucleated cells, similar in every i respect to those which in other situations form the epidermis. These cells gradually enlarge as they are pushed upwards into the soft bulb, and some of them contain pigment-granules, which either exist in separate cells, or are separate, or aggregated round the nucleus; it is these granules which give rise to the colour of the hair. It occasionally happens that these pigment-gi-anules completely fill the cells in the centre of the bulb, which gives rise to the dark tract of pigment often found, of greater or less i length, in the axis of the hair. The shaft of the hair consists of a central part or mednlla, the fibrous part of the hair, and the cortex externally. The medulla occupies the centre of the shaft, and ceases towards the point of the hair. It is usually ■ wanting in the fine hairs covering the surface of the body, and commonly in those of the head. It is more opaque and deeper coloured than the fibrous part, and consists of cells containing pigment or fat-granules. The fibrous portion of the hair constitutes the chief part of the stem; its cells are elongated, and unite to form flattened fusiform fibres. These also contain pigment-granules, which assume a linear arrangement. The cells which form the cortex of the hair consist of a single layer which surrounds those of the fibrous part; they are converted into thin flat scales, having an imbricated arrangement. The Sebaceous Glands are small, sacculated, glandular organs, lodged in the substance of the corium, or subdermoid tissue. They are found in most parts of the skin, but are most abundant in the scalp and face; they are also very numerous around the apertures of the anus, nose, mouth, and external ear; but are wanting in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Each gland consists of a single duct, more or less capacious, which terminates in a lobulated pouch-like extremity. The basement membrane forming the wall of the sac, as well as the duct, is lined by epithelium, which is filled with particles of sebaceous matter; and this becoming detached into the cavity of the sac, as its growth is renewed, constitutes the secretion. The sacculi connected with each duet vary in number from two to five, or even twenty. The orifices of the ducts open most frequently into the hair-follicles, but occasionally upon the general surface. On the nose and face, the glands are of large size, distinctly lobulated, and often become much enlarged from the accumulation of pent-up secretion. The largest sebaceous glands are those found in the eyelids, the Meibomian glands. The Sudoriferous or Sweat Glands are the organs by which a laro-e portion of the aqueous and gaseous materials are excreted by the skin. They are found m almost every part of the skin, and are situated in small pits m the deep parts of the corium, or in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, ■ surrounded by a quantity of adipose tissue. They are small, lobular, reddish bodies, consisting of one or more convoluted tubuli, from which i the efferent duct proceeds upwards through the corium and cuticle, and opens upon the surface by a slightly enlarged orifice. The efferent duct, ns It passes through the corium, pursues, for a short distance, a spiralxcvi GENERAL ANATOMY. course, becoming straight in the more superficial part of this layer, and opens on the surface of the cuticle by an oblique valve-like aperture. In the parts where the epidermis is thin, the ducts are finer, and almost straight in their course; but where the epidermis is thicker, they assume again a spiral arrangement, the separate windings of the tube bemg as close and as regular as those of a common screw. The spiral course of these ducts is especially distinct in the thick cuticle of the palm ot the hand and sole of the foot. The size of the glands varies. They are especially large in those regions where the amount of perspiration is great, as in the axillffi, where they form a thin mammillated layer of a reddish colour, which corresponds exactly to the situation of the hair in this region; they are large, also, in the groin. Their number varies. They are most numerous on the palm of the hand, presentmg, accordmg to Krause, 2,800 orifices on a square inch of the integument, and are rather less numerous on the sole of the foot. In both of these situations, the orifices of the ducts are exceedingly regular, and correspond to the small transverse grooves which intersect the ridges of papillae. In other situations they are more irregularly scattered, but in nearly equal numbers, over parts including the same extent of surface. In the neck and back they are least numerous, their number amounting to 41/ on the square inch (Krause). Their total number is estimated by the same writer at 2,381,248 ; and supposing the aperture of each gland to represent a surface of -^th of a line in diameter, he calculates that the whole of these glands would present an evaporating surface of about eight square inches. Each gland consists of a single tube intricately convoluted, termmating at one end by a blind extremity, and opening at the other end upon the sm-face of the skin. In the larger glands this single duct usuaUy divides and subdivides dichotomously; the smaller ducts ultimately terminating in short c^cal pouches, rarely anastomosing. The wall of the duct is thick; the width of the canal rarely exceeding one-thu'd of its diameter. _ The | tube, both in the gland and where it forms the excretory duct, consists of two ayers : an outer, formed by fine areolar tissue; and an inner layer of epithelium. The external, or fibro-cellular coat, is thm continuous with the superficial layer of the corium, and extends only as high as the surface of the true skin. The epithelial lining is much thicker, continuous with 1 epidermis, and alone forms the spiral portion of the tube. When he cuticle is carefully removed from the surface of the cutis, these convoluted :W epidermis may be drawn out, and fc.m -Pf on its under surface. According to Kolliker, a layer of non-striated musclar fibres, arranged longitudinally, is found -en the are^^^^^^^^^^^ epithelial coats of the ducts of the larger sweat-glands, as in the axilla, root of the penis, on the labia majora, and round the anus. The contents of the smaller sweat-glands are quite fluid; ^ ^he larger glands, the contents are semi-fluid and opaque, and contain a number'of coloured granules, and cells which appear analogous to epithelial cells.I xcvii EPITHELIUM. THE EPITHELIUM. All the surfaces of the body, the external surface of the skin, the in- ternal surface of the digestive and respiratory tracts, the closed serous cavities, and the ducts of all glands, are covered by one or more layers of simple cells, called epithelium or epithelial cells, which serve various purposes, both as a protective layer, and as an agent in secretion. Thus, in the skin, the main purpoee served by the epithelium (here called the epidermis) is that of protection. As the surface is worn away by the a.gency of friction or change of temperature, new cells are supplied, and thus the surface of the true skin, and the vessels and nerves which it contains, are defended from damage. In the gastro-intestinal mucous j membrane and in the glands, the epithelial cells appear to be the principal agents in separating the secretion from the blood or from the alimentary fluids. In other situations (as the nose, fauces, and respiratory passages) the chief ofl&ce of the epithelial cells appears to be to maintain an equable temperature by the moisture with which they keep the surface always slightly lubricated. In the serous carities they also keep the opposed layers moist, and thus facilitate their movements on each other. Finally, in all internal parts they ensure a perfectly smooth surface. The epithelium is usually spoken of as tesselated or pavement, columnar, spheroidal or glandular, and ciliated. The pavement-eT^ithelixim. is composed of flat nucleated scales of various shapes, usu:ally polygonal, and varying in size. These scales often contain Fig. XL.—Epithelial cells in tLe oral cavity of man. a, Large, b, Middle-sized, c, The same with two nuclei. Magnified 350 times. ■granules, as in Eig. XL. This kind of epithelium is found on the surface of the skin (epidermis), on all the serous surfaces (unless the ventricles of the brain be an exception), on the lining membranes of the blood-vessels, ■ on many of the mucous membranes, and in the ducts. The nails, hairs, and in animals the horns, are a variety of this kind of epithelium. The columnar epithelium (Fig. XLI.) is formed of cylindrical or rod- shaped cells, each containing a nucleus, and set together, so as to form a complete membrane. This form of epithelium covers the mucous membrane of the whole gastro-intestinal tract and the glands of that part, the gi-eater part of the fGENERAL ANATOMY. xcvUi urethra, the vas deferens, the prostate, Cowper's glands, Bartholine'i glands, and a portion of the uterine mucous membrane.

Ciliated epithelium (Fig. XLin.) maybe of any of the precedmg forms, but usuaUy inclines to the columnar shape.

These membranes consist of a layer of epithelium supported on a struc- tureless membrane, called the basement membrane, beneath which lies a tract of connective or areolar tissue, which in the mucous membranes lodges glands of various kinds, and contains unstriped muscle, or contrac- tile muscular fibre-cells, and in both serous and mucous membranes con- veys the blood-vessels out of which the secretion is to be eliminated. The serous membranes are the simplest of the three, and will therefore be first described. They form shut sacs, sometimes arranged quite simply, as the tunica vaginalis testis, at others with numerous involutions and recesses, as the peritoneum, but which can always be traced continuously around the \vhole circumference. The sac is completely closed, so that no communi- cation exists between the serous cavity and the parts in its neighbourhood. An apparent exception exists in the peritoneum of the female; for the Eallopian tube opens freely into the peritoneal cavity in the dead subject, so that a bristle can be passed from the one into the other. But this communication is closed during life, except at the moment of the passage of the ovum out of the ovaiy into the tube, as is proved by the fact that no interchange of fluids ever takes place between the two cavities in dropsy of the peritoneum, or in accumulation of fluid in the Fallopian tubes. The serous membrane is often supported by a firm fibrous layer, as is the case with the pericardium, and such membranes are sometimes spoken of as ' fibro-serous.' In the parietal portion of the arachnoid there is, according to many anatomists, no serous membrane in the proper sense of the term; but the dura mater is merely lined with a layer of epithe- lium, the basement-membrane being here indistinguishable. In other situations, the following parts may be recoghised as constituting a serous membrane:—i. The epithelium, a single layer of polygonal or pavement- epithelial cells. 2. A structureless basement-membrane. 3. The connec- tive tissue and vessels which support the latter, connect it with the parts below, and supply blood to its deep surface. Some of the serous portion of the blood is secreted, or transudes, through the basement-membrane to famish the special secretion. This latter is, in most cases, only in suffix cient quantity to moisten the membrane, but not to furnish any appreciable quantity of fluid. When a smaU quantity can be collected, it appears to resemble in many respects the lymph, and like that fluid coagulates spontaneously, but when secreted in large quantities, as in dropsy, it is a wateiy fluid containing usually sufficient albumen to gelatinise with heat.* The mucous membranes are more complex in their structure than the serous. Their epithelium is of various forms, including the spheroidal, columnar and ciliated, and is often arranged in several layers (see Fig. XLIII.). This epithelial layer is supported by the cormm, which is ' The resemblance Jptween lymph and serum led Hewaon to the belief that the serous cavities are sacs into which the lymphatics open. f 2o GENERAL ANATOMY. analogous to the derma of the skin; and is in fact continuous with it at the orifices of the body. The corium consists, as it is usually described, of a transparent structureless basement-membrane next to the epithelium, supported by a fibro-vascular layer of variable thickness below it, and this merging into the sub-mucous areolar tissue. It is only in some situations that the basement-membrane can be demonstrated. The fibro-vascular layer of the corium contains, besides the white and yellow fibrous tissue and the vessels, muscular fibre-cells, nerves, and lymphatics, in various proportions. Embedded in it are found numerous glands and projecting out of it are processes (villi and papilhcc) analogous to the' papilla of the skin. These glands and processes, however, exist only at certain parts, and it will be more convenient to refer for their description to the sequel, where the parts are described in which they occur Thus the mucous glands are described in the account of the mouth, the stomach, the intestines, &c., the papilla and vilH with that of the tongue. . , , x .i i- The synovial membranes are analogous m structure to the serous, but differ from them in the nature of their secretion, which rather resembles mucus. They are described on p. 146. SECRETING GLANDS. The secreting glands are organs in which the blood ckculating in capil- lary vessels is brought into contact with the epitheHal cells of a mucous membrane, whereby certain elements are separated ('secreted ) out of the blood, and are poured into the mucous cavity. This cavity is arranged m the form of a ramifying duct, the secreting cells lymg m, or touching the terminal ramifications (or more correctly the commencing radicles) of the ^""tn size the glands vary extremely: thus the liver weighs nearly four pounds, while many of the mucous glands are only visible to the naked eye when distended wiJh secretion: and they vary not less m struc ure. Thus the sti'ucture of the liver is so complex that it can hardly y^t be regarded as known with absolute certainty, while there are a great many glands which consist either of a single tube lined with epi helium, on the outer Tide of which the blood circulates, or even a simple closed sac which opens when it becomes charged with secretion. , •. n .

Instances of such glands will be found m the salivary glands, the pancreas, &c. Or the necessary extent of epithelial ' sui'face may be obtained by the duct being coiled on itself, as m the ; sweat-glands (Fig. XXXIX. p. xc), or the extremity of the duct only may be thus arranged (see the figure of the testis, p. 713) • In other glands, as iu the kidney, the mucous duct is undivided from the beginning, and the y capiUaries from which the secretion is to be eliminated are distributed ! upon its waUs or project into its ampullated commencement (Fig. 377, p. 692).

Kg. XLIV—Ovum of the sow. CtmaiLd spot^ THE whole body grows out of the fecundated ovura, and it is accordingly necessary to follow in as few words as possible the various stages in which the ovum is found in the uterus, from the earliest moment at which conception can be recognised as having taken place, down to the birth of the complete foetus. The ovum is a small spheroidal body situated in immature G-raafaan vesicles near their centre, but in the mature ones in contact with the membrana granulosa (see p. 724), at that part of the vesicle which projects from the surface of the ovary. The cells of the membrana granu- losa are accumulated round the ovum in greater number than at any other part of the vesicle, forming a kind of granular zone, the discus prohgerus (Fig. XLIY.). The human ovum (Fig. XLV.) is -ex- tremely minute, measuring from ^j^^^ to -^_th of an inch in diameter. It is a cell, consisting externally of a transparent en- velope, the zona pellucida or vitelline mem- brane. Within this, and in close contact with it, is the yelk or vitellus ; imbedded in the substance of the yelk is a small vesi- cular body, the germinal vesicle (vesicle of Purkinje)-the nucleus of the cell; and this contains as its nucleolus a small spot—the macula germinativa, or the spot of Wagner. The zona pellucida, or vitelline membrane, is XLV,—Human ovum, a thick, colourless, transparent membrane, which appears under the microscope as a bright ring, bounded externally and internally by a dark outline. It corresponds to the chorion of the impregnated ovum. The yelk consists of granules and globules of various sizes, imbedded in a more or less viscid fluid. The smaller granules resemble pigment; the larger granules, which are m greatest number at the periphery of the yelk, resemble fat-globules. In the human ovum, the number of granules is comparatively small. The qermvnal vesicle consists of a fine, transparent, structureless mem- brane containing a watery fluid, in which are occasionally found a few ZZnles. It is about ^ th of an inch in diameter, and m immature ov^ tTZllj in the .centre of the yelk, but, as the ovum becomes developed, rapproaches the surface, and enlarges much less rapidly than the yelk. from a middle-sized follicle, magnified 350 times, a, Yitelline membrane.

The germinal spot occupies tliat part of the periphery of the germinal vesicle which is nearest to the periphery of the yelk. It is opaque, of a yeUow colour, and finely granular in structure, measuring from -^^th. to ^^^th of an inch. The phenomena attending the discharge of the ova from the Graafian vesicles, since they belong as much or more to the ordinary function of the ovary than to the general subject of the growth of the body, are described with the anatomy of the ovaries in the body of the work. The first changes in the ovum which take place upon conception, appear to be as follows :—The spermatozoon penetrates the ovum,^ the effect of i which is to bring it into contact with the yelk, and with the germinal vesicle 1 contained in the yelk. It seems as if this normally occurs in the Fallopian j tube,t and abnormally it may even take place in the peritoneal cavity. \ The first effect is to produce a cleavage and multiplication of the yelk, which Fio-.

The clear corpuscles (polar globules of Robin) are seen in the first two. \ becomes first cleft into two masses, then into four, and so on, until at length a mulberry-like agglomeration of nucleated ceUs results (Fig. XLVI.). It ) appears probable that this proliferation is due to some change in the ger- minal vesicle and its nucleolus, but the nature of such change has not been made out. Some observers describe it as consisting simply in the i cleavage of the vesicle and nucleolus, others in their disappearance and replacemen-t by a fresh cell, or nucleus, the. embryo-cell, around which the yelk gathers. In this view the fertilisation of the yelk is due to the solution of the germinal vesicle under the action of the spermatozoon. There are also found within the vitelline membrane one or more clear globules, called ' polar globules ' by Eobin, because they lie near one of the I poles of segmentation. The nature, origin, and uses of these bodies are not ! known. They seem to be usually regarded as produced by the liquefaction j of the yelk, and as not being essential to the process of fructification. iThe globules of which the yelk is now composed soon arrange them- selves into the form of a membrane lined with pavement-epithelium. As the yelk-mass softens, fluid accumulates in the interior of this membrane, j spreading it out on the internal surface of the vitelline membrane. The j latter (external) membrane (Fig. XLVIII.) soon becomes covered with gi-anulations or vegetations, giving it a shaggy appearance, and then takes I the name of the ' primitive chorion,' whilst the internal membraiue is called ' the ' blastodermic membrane or vesicle.' * See Newport, PMl. Trans. 1853, vol. ii. p. 233. This has been since confirmed by other observers on various lower animals, and may ha assumed to be generally true. t Many physiologists, as Bischoff and Dr. M. Barry, believe that the ovum is fecundated in the ovary, but the reasonmg of Dr. Allen Thomson appears very cogent in proving that the usual spot at which the spermatozoon meets with the ovum is in the tube.oiv» GENERAL ANATOMY. The blastodermic membrane soon afterwards splits into two layers, the division proceeding from the point where the thickening or aggregation next to be described as the ge;-minal area occurs, and extending gradually over the whole circumference of the ovum, which now consists of three concentric layers of membrane—the external, the primitive chorion, the middle, the external layer of the blastodermic vesicle, and the inner, its internal layer. The annexed figure shows this division commencing. It Fisr XLVII —Ovum with the germinal area, seen in profile to show the division of the blas- todermic membrane.

The internal layer of the blastodermic membrane next separates into two at the situa- tion of the area germinativa. The membrane which results from this separation is called the middle layer of the germinal or blastodermic membrane, and is distinguished from the others in not being co-extensive with the embryo, but existing only at the germinal area. Germinal area.—In the mass of nucleated ceUs into which the yelk becomes converted during the formation of the blastodermic vesicle, a small agglomeration is formed, which then spreads out into an area of nucleated cells, from which the embryo is to be formed, and which has accordingly received the name of germinal disc or area germinahva. In this portion of the ovum the first trace of the embyro appears as a faint streak, which is caUed the primitvve trace or prmiihve groove. This groove first deepens into a deep furrow, bounded by two plates—the lamince dorsales, beneath which a delicate fibril appea.rs-the chordu dorsalis or notochord-in which cartilage can very early be recognised, and which forms the future spinal column. » ., The germinal disc is found to consist on a transverse section of three layers: an upper (external), or serous 9 a lower (internal), or mucous ; and a middle layer, which is formed from the mucous lamina, a« above shown. The chorda dorsalis and the laminae dorsales are the rudiments of the vertebral column and canal. The upper or serous layer of the embryo eives origin to the cerebrospinal nervous centres, and to the organs of the senses, including the cuticle and its appendages, as also to the mammary dands. From the middle layer are developed the locomotive organs, the sninal and sympathetic nerves, the vascular system, the ductless glands, the sexual organs, the cutis where the middle layer touches on the ex- ternal and the muscular and submucous coats of the intestines, where it touches on the internal layer. The latter furnishes the hnmg of the alimentary canal and its various appendages, liver, pancreas, &c., the re-cv BLASTODERMIC MEMBRANE.

Besides this, however, there are three api^endages to the ovum, which must now be described as the amnion, the ^(,mh^l^cal vesicle, and the allantois. Formation of the amnion.—The amnion is formed from the external ger- minal layer, which is drawn in on all sides by the changes of shape of the embryo. The embryo as it grows becomes curved at its anterior and pos- terior end, so as to form the cephalic and caudal flexures (Fig. XLIX., B) ; ifc also curves on itself laterally towards the umbilicus (Fig. XLVIII. 7), and as it does so, it draws the external germinal layer with it, forming double folds which meet at the umbilicus, and at a point opposite to the umbilicus on the dorsal aspect of the embryo, sometimes called ' the pos- terior umbilicus' (Fig. XLIX., 8'), and these folds finally communicate so as to. form a delicate closed sac, into which a serous fluid—the liquor amnii—is secreted. This fluid increases in quantity up to about the end of the fifth or the sixth month, when it reaches the amount of about two pints. Thence it diminishes, and at the end of pregnancy is about half its maxi- mum quantity. The outer layer of the amnion encloses all the parts of which the embryo consists, and is in contact externally with the chorion. The portion of the external germinal layer which does not take part in the formation of the amnion is called the vesicula serosa (Fig. XLIX., 2'). When the sac of the amnion is completely closed, the vesicula serosa be- comes detached from it, and then forms an envelope to the ovum, lining the primitive chorion. Its future destination appears to be to form the epithelial layer of the secondary or permanent chorion. The aliantois (Fig. XLIX., al) is a projection from near the hinder part of the embryo, formed by the middle and internal germinal layers, and therefore continuous with the intestinal cavity. The lower part of this cavity becomes the uro-genital sinus, and it is to the urinary tract that the allantois mainly belongs. It projects out from the embryo through the same opening as the vitelline or umbilical duct. The lower part of the aUantois which is contained within the embryo becomes the bladder; the upper part of its intra-embryonic portion is denominated the urachus; the extra-em- bryonic portion is divided into two parts, called the allantoic vesicle, or the epithelial portion of the allantois, and the fibrous or vascular portion. The allantois, which is at first a simple serous membrane, becomes vascular over its whole extent about the fifth week, and its vessels communicate, as will be described presently, with those of the chorion, forming the vascular connection between the mother and fcetus. In the human foetus the allantoic vesicle is small, soon withers and disappears, and its vessels are soon limited to the two umbilical arteries and one vein. The allantoic fluid is alkaline and contains from one to four per cent, of solid matters-uric acid, urea, allantoin, sugar, and salme matters. TImhilical vesicle (Figs. XLVIII. XLIX., o).-The embryo itself m the earliest recognisable condition is, as above stated, a mere streak, but it soon becomes curved ateitherend, corresponding to the head and lower extreinity of the future animal (the tail of animals, the buttocks and lower limbs in man); the lower part is, however, open, and from this a body projects which at first consists of the matter into which the yelk has been developed (yelk- sac), and later on is converted into a vesicular body filled with clear fluid (the umbilical vesicle), and communicating with the body of the embryo by aBLASTODERMIC MEMBRANE. evil Ro- XLIX Dia-rams to sbowtlie development of the three blastodermic layers on antero- ■nostPrio'r sections A portion of ovum with the vitelline membrane and germinal area. ^ SriF, Varimis slJges of development.

It is formed mainly by the internal germinal layer, but has a lining derived from the middle layer. As the arteries developed in the middle layer grow they cover the umbilical vesicle, forming the vascular area, the chief vessels of which are the omphalomesenteric, two in number. The vessels of this area appear to absorb the fluid of the umbilical vesicle, which dries up into a disc-like body attached to the amnion, and having no further function. The activity of the umbilical vesicle ceases about the same time (fifth or sixth week) as the allantois is formed. In fact, the umbilical vesicle provides nutrition to the foetus from the ovum itself, while the allantois is the channel whereby nutrition is conveyed to it from the uterine tissues. The umbilical vesicle, however, is visible, containing fluid up to the fourth or fifth month, between the amnion and the chorion, with its pedicle and the omphalomesenteric vessels. The latter vessels then become atrophied, as the functional activity of the body with which they are connected ceases. The Chorion (Figs. L., Jc, LI.).—The primitive chorion has already been described. It is formed by the vitelline membrane, which becomes covered with shaggy villous processes, and disappears about the fifteenth day, to give place to the secondary or permanent chorion. The latter is composed of two lamellae, the external of one which is furnished by the vesicula serosa, (or false amnion), and the internal by the fibrous layer of the allantois. This latter furnishes a. vascular membrane, which is applied to the epithe- lial layer of the chorion (vesicula serosa) (Fig. XLIX., 13, 14, i5)- -^.s the latter becomes villous by the development of tufts upon it {shaggy chorion), the blood-vessels of the internal layer pass into these tufts, form- ing the foetal portion of the placenta, and dipping through the decidua into the uterine sinuses of the maternal placenta. The Decidua (Figs. XLIX. L.) is formed from the mucous mem- brane of the uterus. Even before the arrival of the fecundated ovum m the uterus, the mueous membrane of the latter becomes vascular and tumid, and when the ovum has reached the utenis, it is imbedded in the folds of the mucous membrane, which overlap, and finally completely encn-cle the ovum. Thus two portions of the uterine mucous membrane (decidua) are formed—viz. that which coats the muscular waU of the utems, decidua vera and that which is in contact with the ovum, decidua reflexa. The decidua does not extend into the neck of the uterus, which after conception is closed by a plug of mucus. The decidua vera is perforated by the openings formed by the enlarged uterine glands, which become much hyper- trophied and developed into tortuous tubes. It contains at a later period numerous arteries and venous channels, continuous with the uterine sinuses, and it is from it that the uterine part of the placenta is developed. The portion of the decidua vera which takes part in the formation ot the placenta is called < decidua serotina.' ^ The decidua reflexa is shaggy on its outer aspect, but smooth within The vessels which it contains at first disappear after about the third month • about the fifth or sixth month the space between the two layers of the decidua disappears, and towards the end of pregnancy the decidua is transformed into a thin yellowish membrane, which constitutes the external envelope of the ovum.THE PLACENTA. cue The Placenta is tlie organ by which the connection between the foetus and mother is maintained, and through which blood reaches the fcetus and I is returned to the uterus. It therefore subserves the purposes both of circulation and respiration. It is formed of tAVO parts, as already shown- i viz. the maternal portion which is developed out of the decidua vera F\g.

(serotina), and the fcetal placenta formed by the villous chorion. Its shape in the human subject is that of a disc, one side of which adheres to the uterine walls, while the other is covered by the amnion. The villi of the chorion (or foetal placenta) gradually enlarge, forming large projections— ' cotyledons '—which each contain the ramifications of vessels communi- cating with the umbilical arteries and veins of the foetus. These vascular tufts are covered with epithelium, and project into corresponding depres- sions in the mucous membrane of the uterine walls. The maternal portion of the placenta consists of a large number of cells formed by an enlarge- ment of the vessels of the uterine wall, and conveying the uterine blood into close proximity to the villi of the foetal placenta, which dip into these cells. The interchange of fluids, necessary for the growth of the foetus, and for the depuration of the blood, takes place through the walls of theseGENERAL ANATOMY. cx villi, but there is no direct continuity between the maternal and foetal vessels. The arteries open into the placental cells somewhat after the manner of the erectile tissue. The veins anastomose freely with one another, and give rise at the edge of the placenta to a venous channel ■which runs around its whole circumference—the placental sinus. The umbilical cord appears about the end of the fifth month after preg- nancy. It consists of the coils of two arteries (umbilical) and a single vein, united together by a gelatinous mass (gelatin of Wharton) contained in the cells of°an areolar structure. There are originally two umbilical veins, but one of these vessels becomes obliterated, as do also the two omphalomesenteric arteries and veins, and the duct of the umbilical vesicle, all of which are originally contained in the rudimentary cord. The permanent structures of the cord are therefore those furnished by the allantois. Growth of the embryo.—The youngest human embryos which have been met with are two described by Dr. A. Thomson in the ' Edinb. Med. and Surg. Journal, 1839,' and in his paper references to the other extant de- scriptions of early ova will be found. The ova in question were believed to be of the ages respectively of twelve to fourteen days, and about fifteen days.* The figures are here reproduced. The earliest ovum (Fig. LI.) was of i rig.

The chorion presented a slightly villous appearance, and consisted only of one lityer ot membrane. On opening it the umbilical vesicle and embryo were found not to fiU its cavity completely. The embryo was a line in length, and nearly ^ of an inch in thickness. The chorion was united to the embijo and umbilical vesicle by a thin tenacious web of albuminous filaments, formed probably by coagulation in the spirit in which it had been kept. There were no vessels on the umbilical vesicle. The abdomen of the em- bryo presented no appearance of intestine, but merely a long shaliow groove, forming a common cavity with the yelk-sac. Around this intes- tinal groove the germinal membrane was continuous with that on tne • For the data on which these calculations arc founded, the reader is referred to the original paper.EARLY HUMAN EMBRYOS. cxi surface of the yelk-sac. One extremity of the embryo, probably the cephalic, was enlarged, but this the author believed to be accidental. A I more opaque and expanded portion between the cephalic extremity and the siu-face of the yelk-sac appeared to him to indicate the rudimentary heart. The second embryo (Figs. LII. LIII.) was in a slightly more advanced condition. In it, as in the former, the amnion and allantois were not found, J though the adhesion of the embryo by its dorsal aspect to the inner side of the chorion renders it probable that the amnion was formed. The cephalic and caudal extremities could be easily distinguished; the vertebral groove appeared to be open in its whole extent; there was a more perfect intes- : tinal groove than in the former case, and there was an irregular-shaped mass between the yelk and the cephalic extremity of the embryo, which Professor Thomson believed to be the rudiment of the heart. No distinct ' trace of the omphalomesenteric vessels could be observed.'^ In an embryo of fifteen to eighteen days, described by Coste, the villi of the chorion were well formed, the umbilical vesicle communicated Pig.

In ova of the third and fourth week the amnion has been found closed, the rudiments of the eye, ear, maxillary projections, pharyngeal arches, cerebral vesicles, anterior and posterior extremities, liver and umbilical cord are observed (Fig. LIY.). The further development of the embryo will perhaps be better under- stood if we follow as briefly as possible the principal facts relating to the chief parts of which the body consists—viz., the spine, the cranium, the pharyngeal cavity, mouth, &c., the nervous centres, the organs of the senses, the circulatory system, the alimentary canal and its appendages, the organs * A third early embryo Is figured and described in this paper, but the author is more uncertam as to its date. Icxii GENERAL ANATOMY. of respiration, and the genito-m-inary organs.* The reader is also referred to the chronological table of the development of the fcetus at the end of the Introduction. Bevelupment of the spine.—The first trace of the future spinal column is found at a very early period of foetal life, constituti ig the chorda clorsalis or notochm-d (Fig. XLVIII.). This is a cylindrical tube, composed of a transparent sheath, containing embryonic cells, and extending from the cephalic to the caudal extremity of the fcetus below the spinal canal. The protovertehroB or primitive vertehrce appear early, as dark spots, which soon enlarge and form quadrangular laminse, one on either side of the chorda dorsalis, commencing in the cervical region. These spread out and bend towards each other, so as to come into contact around the spinal canal and enclose it, forming the rudiment of the future bodies and arches of the vertebrse, as weU as of the vertebral and other muscles. This primitive vertebral column is, however, entirely membranous until about the sixth or seventh week, when cartilage begins to be deposited in it. The proto- vertebrse do not coincide with the permanent vertebrEe. On the contrary, each primitive vertebra separates into two parts, the upper part belonging to the permanent vertebra, which lies above the point of separation, and the lower one to that below. The chorda dcrsalis becomes gradually atrophied, except at the part corresponding to the intervals between the permanent vertebrse, where it forms the intervertebral discs. The par- ticular facts relating to the ossification of the spinal column wiU be found at pp. lO et seq. Development of the cranium in general, and oftheface.-The foetal cranium is developed from the primitive vertebral discs surrounding the upper extremity of the chorda dorsalis. These advance in the form of a mem- branous capsule, which covers the end of the chorda dorsalis, forming the rudiment of the base of the skull, and moulds itself on the cerebra vesicles, so as to constitute the membrane in which the vault of the skuU is developed. The membranous capsule presents at the base of the skniU two thickenings (lateral trabecule of Eathke) directed forwards, and enclosing an opening (pituitary opening) which is partly closed by a thinner membrane-the middle trabecula. The upper end of the chorda dorsalis terminates in a pointed extremity, which extends about as far forwards as the body of the sphenoid bone, where it becomes lost abou the tTation of the pituitary body, ^^^^^f^^^^^^^^^^^^ cartilao-e in the part corresponding to the base of the skull and the tra b"ut!

The upper or posterior curvature is called the cerebral; the lower or anterior, the frontal protuberance. From the anterior end of the chorda dorsalis four prolongations proceed on either side, and meet in the middle line (Fig. LV., 4, 7, 8, 9). These are the pharyngeal arches, and in them, and in the frontal protuberance, certain Fig. LV.-Face of an embryo of 4to 28 days, magnified 15 times, i, Frontal P;"mi°ence °2, 3, Tvifrht and left olfactory fc^. 4, Inferior maxillary tubercles, united in the middle line. 5, Superior maxillai-y tubercles. 6, Mouth. 7, Second pharyngeal arch, 8, Ihud, 6, Fourth. 10, Primitive ocular vesicle. 11, Frimitive auditory vesicle. bones are developed, which are called secondary bones, to distinguish them i from those above enumerated, which are formed from the primitive cranium I itself. Between the first pharyngeal arch and the frontal protuberance is situated the buccal depression, which afterwards becomes the cavity of the mouth. The frontal protuberance next gives off two lateral parts (lateral frontal protuberances), on each of which a depression is formed, the olfac- ^ tory fossa, boimded on either side by the internal and external nasal pro- cesses. There is a groove external to the external nasal process, which afterwards is transformed into the lachrymal canal, and another groove leading from the olfactory fossa to the buccal cavity—the nasal groove. The first pharyngeal arch divides at its anterior extremity into two parts—a superior and inferior maxillary protuberance. The latter unites very early to its fellow of the opposite side to form the lower jaw. Tlie superior maxillary protuberances are displaced outwards and unite to the external nasal process ; from this part are developed the internal plate of the pterygoid process, the palate bone, the superior maxillary and the malar. The lateral masses of the ethmoid, the os unguis and nasal bones are furnished by the internal nasal process. The rest of these processes on either side is united by a single protuberance, the incisive tubercle from which the intermaxillary bone and the middle of the upper lip is formed, and, according to some, the vomer. gcxiv GENiORAL ANATOMY. in the form of a rod of cartilage lying inside the lower jaw. From th Hi Besides the lower jaw, the inferior maxillary iM'otuberance furnishes :i transitory cartilaginous mass—the cartilage of Meckel—from which the malleus and incus are formed. The remains of Meckel's cartilage per- sist as long as till the end of the seventh or the eight month of fatal liic second pharyngeal arch are formed the stapes and stapedius muscle, th pyramid, the styloid process, the stylohyoid ligament, and the small con of the hyoid bone. The great cornu and body of the hyoid bone a re - developed from the third arch, while the fourth pharyngeal arch enter. merely into the formation of the soft parts of the neck, and does not giv. ■ origin to any special organ. The pharyngeal or branchial fissures ar.. four in number, tlie fourth being situated beneath or below the fourth arch ; the first persists, though only in a portion of its extent, forming the Eustachian tube, the meatus auditorins, and the tympanic cavity. The other fissures are wholly closed by the sixth week. Development of the paZafe.—The buccal cavity is at first common to the mouth and nose. Then a lamella is given off from the superior maxillary tuberosity on either side, which is directed horizontally inwards. These two palatine lamella meet in the median line, in front, about the eighth week, and by the ninth week the septum should be complete. The superior maxillary bones proper, and the soft parts covering them, unite at an early period with the incisive bone, and the median portion of the lower lip. The olfactory fossce open into the upper (respiratory) portion of the cavity, forming the nostrils. The student will notice that the various forms of hare-lip correspond to various interruptions of the process of union; thus the ordinary single hare-lip on one side of the median line results from the mere absence of union on that side, between the soft parts which cover the incisive bone and those connected with the proper superior maxiUary; if this occurs on both sides, we have the simplest form of double hare-lip ; if besides this, the intermaxillary bone remains ununited, it usually is carried forward at the end of the vomer, forming the double hare-lip, com- plicated with projection of the intermaxillary bone: if, added to this, the palatine lamellse also remain ununited, we have the complete degree ot fissnred palate and hare-lip. Fissure of the soft palate only, or of the soft and a portion of the hard, represent various degrees ot non-union ot the palatine lamellffi. Development of the nervous centres.—The medullary groove above de- scribed (p. civ.) presents about the third week three dilatations at its upper part, separated by two constrictions, and at its posterior part another dilatation called the rhomboidal sinns. Soon afterwards _ the groove becomes a closed canal (medullary canal), and a soft blastema is deposited in it, which lines it, corresponding to its dilatations, and, like it, assuming a tubular form. This is the rudiment of the cerebro-spmal axis As the embryo grows, its cephalic part becomes more curved, and the three dila- tations in the anterior end of the primitive cerebro-spinal axis becouia vesicles distinctly separated from each other (Fig. LVL). These are tlx cerebral vesicles-anterior, middle and posterior. The a.nterior cerebr vesicle (situated at this period quite below the middle vesicle) is the rudiCSV DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN. ment of the lateral and third ventricles, and of the parts surrounding them— viz. the cerebral hemispheres, optic thalami, corpora striata, corpus cal- losiun fornix, and all the parts which form the floor of the third ventricle. The middle vesicle represents the aqueduct of Sylvius with the corpora quadrio-emina, and the crura cerebri. The posterior vesicle is developed into the fourth ventricle, and its walls form the cerebellum. Pons Varolii, Tw.

The antero-posterior fissure which indicates the division of the brain into two halves appears early, and the primary anterior and posterior cerebral vesicles are also soon divided by a transverse fissure into two parts, so as to constitute five permanent rudiments of the brain and medulla oblongata. The middle primary vesicle remains undivided. The anterior part of the anterior cerebral vesicle (Vorderhirn, fore brain) constitutes the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, corpora striata, fornix, lateral ventricles, and olfactory nerves. These parts lie at first quite covered and concealed by those formed from the middle vesicle, and by the optic thalami, which, with the optic nerves, the third ventricle, and the parts in its floor,* are furnished by the posterior portion of the anterior vesicle (Zwischenhirn, intermediary brain). By the third month, however, the hemispheres have risen above the optic thalami, and by the sixth month above the cerebellum. Fissures are seen on the surface of the hemisphere at the third month, but all except one disappear. This one persists, and forms the fissure of Sylvius. The permanent fissures for the convolutions do not form till about the seventh or eighth month. The middle cerebral vesicle (Mittelhirn, middle brain) is at first situated at the summit of the angle shown on Fig. LVI. Its surface, at first smooth, is soon divided by a median and transverse groove into four tubercles (tubercula quadrigemina), which are gradually covered in by the growth of the cerebral hemispheres. The cavity diminishes as its walls thicken, •and contracts to form the aqueduct of Sylvius. The crura cerebri are also formed from this vesicle. The third primary cerebral vesicle is divided at an early period (between the ninth and twelfth week) into two, the anterior part (Hinterhirn, hinder brain) forming the cerebellum, and a membrane (membrana obturatrix), which closes the upper part of the fourth ventricle, and which disappears as development progresses; its posterior * The development of the pituitary body is still a matter of question. g2cxvi GENERAL ANATOMY. part (JSTachhirn, after-brain) forms the medulla oblongata, with the resti- form bodies and auditory nerves.* When the medullary groove is closed, the foetal spinal marrow at first occupies the whole of the canal so formed. It presents at first a large central canal, which gradually contracts, and in after life is no longer per- ceptible to the eye, though it is still visible on microscopic sections (v. p. Ixxiii). After the fourth month the spinal column begins to grow in length more rapidly than the medulla, so that the latter no longer occupies the whole canal. The ganglia and auterior roots of the nerves are perceptible at the fourth week, the posterior roots at the sixth. The cord is com- posed at first entirely of uniform-looking cells, which soon separate into two layers, the inner of which forms the epithelium of the central canal, while the outer forms the central grey substance of the cord. The white columns are formed later; their rudiments can be detected about the fourth week.

As the fissures separating the parts of the cerebro-spmal axis appear, the membranes extend down them, and the pia mater passes into the cerebral ventricles. Bischoff, however, describes the pia mater and arachnoid as developed from the cerebral vesicles, and formed ui the position Avhich they permanently occupy. Development of the eye.—The first rudiment of the eye is seen about the third week, in a vesicle (primitive ocular vesicle), which communicates with the first cerebral vesicle, and after the latter is divided into two, com- municates with its posterior division—the Zwischenhirn or interme- diary brain—by a hollow stalk, which afterwards becomes the optic nerve. This primitive ocular vesicle, derived from the cerebral mass, is invested by a layer from the epidermic lamina of the blastoderm; from the latter layer are derived the conjunctiva, the epithelium of the cornea, and the crystalline lens; while the cephalic layer gives origin to the vitreous body, the fibrous coat of the eye (sclerotic and cornea), the choroid and iris, and the retina. The lens is formed by a thickening of the epidermic layer, opposite to the primitive ocular vesicle, by which that vesicle is at first depressed, and then reversed in the manner indicated by the annexed figures; so that the cavity of the primitive ocular vesicle is finally obliterated. As this process takes place, a secondary cavity (secondary ocular vesicle) is formed between the rudimentary lens and the coats of the reversed primitive vesicle, and in this space the vitreous humour is secreted.

The lens is at first a mere depression in the epidermic layer. When this is closed the lens becomes a vesicle, formed of epithelial cells, which grow and fill its cavity, becoming gradually transformed into fibres. It IS at first surrounded by a vascular membrane—the vascular capsule of the lens—which is connected with the termination of the temporary artery (hyaloid) that forms the continuation of the central artery of the retina through the vitreous chamber. This vascular capsule of the crystalline lens forms the membrana pupiUaris (described on p. 578), and also at- taches the borders of the iris to the capsule of the lens. It disappears about the seventh month.cxviii QENEIlAfi ANATOMY. The sclerotic and cornea, except the epithelial layer of the latter, are formed from the outer layer of the reversed primitive ocular vesicle, the retina from the inner layer; the pigment of the choroid is also derived from the inner layer, its proper tissue from one of these layers, but which has not yet been determined. The cavity of the primitive ocular vesicle disappears as that of the optic nerve does. The eyelids are formed at the end of the third month, as small cutaneous folds, which come together in front of the globe and cohere. This union is broken up, and the eyelids separate before the end of fcetal life. The lachrymal canal appears to result from the non-closure of a fissure which exists between the external nasal process and the maxillary process (p. cxiii.). Development of the ear.—The first rudiment of the ear appears about the same time as that of the eye, in the form of a vesicle (primitive auditory vesicle, Figs. LV., LVI., ii) situated close on the outside of the third cerebral vesicle, though not communicating with it. It is formed by a depression of the epithelium over the second pharyngeal arch, which becomes converted into a closed sac. From this vesicle the internal ear is developed. The auditory nerve is described either as a projection from the third cerebral vesicle, or as an independent formation which unites with both, and thus establishes a communication between the cerebral and the auditory vesicles. The middle ear and Eustachian tube constitute the remains of the first pharyngeal or branchial cleft. The formation of the ossicles of the tympanum has been already pointed out, viz., the mens and malleus from Meckel's cartilage, and the stapes, with its muscle, from the second pharyngeal arch. These parts project into the first pharyngeal cleft, which remains occupied by connective -tissue during the whole of foital Hfe, according to KoUiker. The membrana tympani forms across the cleft, dividing it into an inner and outer portion. The pinna, or external ear, is developed from the soft parts covering the first pharyngeal arch. Development of the 9iose.—Two fossse (olfactory fosste) have been already spoken of, which are found below and in front of the ocular vesicles and the upper maxillary projection (Fig. LV., 2, 3). They appear about the fourth week. Their borders become prominent, and the fossae deepen, ex- cept at the lower part, where they lead by a groove (olfactory groove) into the buccal cavity. This groove is bounded by the internal and external nasal process. As the superior maxilla,ry projection increases, the olfactory groove is transformed into a deep canal, the rudiment of the two superior meatus of the nose. As the palatine septum is formed, the buccal cavity is divided into two parts, the upper of which represents the inferior meatus of the nose, while the lower forms the mouth. The soft parts of the nose are formed from the coverings of the frontal projection, and of the olfactory fossa. The nose is perceptible about the end of the second month. The nostrils are at first closed by epithelium, but this disappears about the fifth month. The olfactory nerve, as above pointed out, is a prolongation, at first m the form of a hollow stalk, from the anterior cerebral vesicle.cxix DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. The development of the teeth is spoken of in the body of the work, p. 609. Development of the slm, glands, and soft parts.-Tho epidermis is pro- duced from the external, the true skin from the middle blastodermic layer, Eig XLVIII 19 20. About the fifth week the epidermis presents two layers, the deeper one corresponding to the rete mucosum. The subcu- taneous fat forms about the fourth month, and the papiUse of the true skm about the sixth. A considerable desquamation of epidermis takes place during foetal life, and this desquamated epidermis mixed with a sebaceous secretion constitutes the ^;ermaJca6-eosa, with which the skin is smeared during the last three months of fcBtal life. The nails are formed at the third month, and begin to project from the epidermis about the sixth. The hairs appear between the third and fourth month in the form of a depression of the deeper layer of the epithelium, which then becomes inverted by a projec- tion from the papillary layer of the skin. The papilla grows into the interior of the epithelial layer, and finally, about the fifth month, the foetal hairs (lanugo) appear first on the head and then on the other parts. These hairs drop off after birth, and give place to the permanent hairs. The sudoriferous and sebaceous glands are also formed from the epithelial layer about the fifth a,nd sixth month respectively. The mammary gland is also formed from the deeper layer of the epithelium. Its first rudiment is seen about the third month, in the form of a small projection, from which others radiate, and which then give rise to the glandular follicles and ducts. The development of the former, however, remains imperfect, except in the adult female, and especially after pregnancy. The muscles become visible about the seventh or eighth week. The source of their development is not completely determined, for the muscles of the limbs. The vertebral muscles appear to be developed from the ' mus- cular laniinse' of the primitive vertebral discs (Fig. XLVIIL, 13), and the muscles of the neck and jaws, as well as those which enclose the cavities of the thorax and abdomen, are also formed from the same source. They do not m-eet in the middle line of the body till about the fourth month. The cutaneous muscles are developed from the cutaneous i^ortion of the middle blastodermic layer. Development of the heart and great vessels.—The first trace of the heart is found about the tenth or twelfth day, in the form of a mass of cells pro- ceeding from the middle layer of the blastodermic vesicle and the anterior wall of the intestinal cavity. It soon forms a bent tube lying in front of the embryo, and only connected to it by its vessels (Fig. LIV., 14). The heart is situated at first at the ontarior end of the embryo, lying opposite the two last cerebral vesicles. As the head is developed, the heart falls as it were backwards to the lower part of the neck, and then to the thorax. It fills the whole thoracic cavity about the second month. As the lungs and thoracic parietes form, the heart assumes its permanent position. The tube is soon curved into the shape of the letter S, the arterial part being situated above, in front and to the right, the venous below, behind and to the left. Traces of the auricular appendages are early perceptible on the venous part. Then the walls of the ventricular portion begin to thicken.Gl-INELIAL ANATOMY. cxx in regard to the anricular part. The ventricle is separated by a constric- tion from the dilated part above, which corresponds to the aortic sinus or bulb (Fig. LIX. A, i), and from the posterior or auricular dilatation. Then each of these three parts becomes subdivided by a septum. After the completion of the ventricuhir septum the auricular is commenced. The septum ventriculorum is at first almost transverse, and divides off a smaller portion (the right ventricle) from the common cavity. This septum is complete about the eighth week, and then the interauricular begins to grow, commencing from above and behind, and coalescing with the edge of the interventricular septum, so as to leave an orifice (auriculo-ventri- CTilar) on either side. The auricular septum, however, is not complete during foetal life, but leaves an aperture (foramen ovale) by which the two auricles communicate. The heart is at first composed of a mass of foetal cells, but its rhythmic contractions can be observed even in this condition before the development of any muscular fibres, and even, according to some authors, before it is in connection with any vessels. The vessels which are in communication with the foetal heart are as follows:—In its earliest state the circulation is external to the embryo. This primitive circulation appears about the fifteenth day, and lasts till the fifth week. It consists of two arteries, the first aortic arches, which Ko- LIX.—Heart at the fifth week.

This vessel surrounds the vascular portion of the germinal area, but does not extend up to the anterior end of the embryo. It terminates on either side in a vein called omphalomesenteric. The two omphalome- senteric veins open by a single trunk into the auricular extremity of the heai-t. This primitive circulation extends gradually from the germinal area over the whole of the umbilical vesicle, and disappears as the latter becomes atrophied. In a more advanced state of the embryo, the position of this first pair of aoi-tic arches corresponds to the first ijharyngeal arch.CXXl DEVELOPMENT OP VESSELS. Next in succession, otlier pairs of arches are formed behind the first^ (Fio- LX). The total number is five, but the whole five pairs do not exist together, for the first two have disappeared before the others are formed ° These two have no representatives in the permanent structures. The third pair gives origin to the carotids, the fourth pair forms the innomiuata and subclavian on the right, the arch of the aorta and subcla- vian on the left. The fifth forms on the left side the pulmonary artery, the ductus arteriosus and the descending portion of the thoracic aorta. Its right branch disappears. The ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, and the root of the pulmonary artery, are at first blended together in the common dilatation (aortic sinus), which has been above spoken of as connected with the ventricular end of the rudimentary heart (Fig. LTX. A, i). The septum which divides this common artery into two begins to appear very early, even before the interventricular septum. The formation of the permanent vessels is shown by the following diagram :— Fi"-. LX. Diagram of the formation of the aortic arches and the large arteries. I. II.

The descending aorta appears to be the remnant of the artery formed by the miion of the two primitive aortae. The omphalomesenteric arteries, which spring from these latter, all disappear except one, which remains as the superior mesenteric artery. The umbilical arteries are at first the terminations of the two principal aortse, but when these vessels are united into one, the umbilical arteries appear as branches, and the aorta itself ends in a caudal prolongation, which afterwards becomes the middle sacral. The common and internal iliac arteries are the only permanent remains of the umbilical arteries (see p. 400). Veins.—The primitive venous circulation has been described above, the two omphalomesenteric veins opening by a common trunk into the lower end of the tube which represents the heart. The next state of the venous circulation is, that at about four weeks there is found a single vein lying behind the intestinal cavity (not in front of it, as the temporary omphalomesenteric veins do), and receiving the trunk vein from the intestine (mesenteric). Two umbilical veins are early formed, and open • The position of the first four of these aortic arches is behind the corresponding pharyn- geal arclies, and that of the fifth behind the fourth pharyngeal cleft.cxxii GENBRAli ANATOMY. together into the common trunk of the omphalomesenteric vein. They receive branches from the allantois and anterior surface of the embryo. The right vein soon disappears; the left umbilical vein, on the contrary, grows till it becomes the trunk vessel into which the omphalomesenteric vein and its mesenteric branch appear to open. Next the liver begins to be formed around the umbilical vein, and then this vein sends branches into that gland (afeerent veins) which afterwards become the portal veins in the interior of the liver, and which give origin to other veins (efferent), which return the blood from the liver, and form afterwards the hepatic veins. The portion of the umbilical vein between the giving off of the future portal vessels and the reception of the hepatic, forms the ductus venosus. The mesenteric vein communicates at first with the omi)halo- mesenteric; when the veins of the liver are formed, the omphalomesenteric is transferred from the umbilical vein to the right afferent hepatic. A portion of it persists and forms the trunk of the portal vein. The systemic veins are developed from four trunk veins, two on either side, above and below, which appear before the formation of the allantois or the umbilical vessels. These unite into one canal on either side (sinuses of Cuvier), which open into the common trunk of the omphalomesenteric veins, and so into the auricular portion of the rudimentary heart. These four primitive veins lie, two of them in front, the anterior cardinal, or jugular veins, and the other two behind, the posterior cardinal veins. As the umbilical vein increases, and the omphalomesenteric diminishes in volume, the sinuses of Cuvier are transferred to the former vein, and when the inferior cava is formed and the umbilical vein becomes merely its tribu- tary, the sinuses of Cuvier open into the inferior vena cava. At a later period the portion of the vena cava inferior, between the opening of the sinuses of Cuvier and the auricle, disappears, and then the auricle receives three veins—viz., the inferior cava, and the two sinuses of Cuvier, which are now called right and left superior vena cava (Fig. LXI.). The superior cardinal, or jugiilar veins, which form the upper branches of the smuses of Cuvier on either side, unite about the second month by a transverse nnas- tomosing branch. The left superior vena ca.va assumes an obhque position, and empties itself into the lower and left end of the auricle. Finally, its trunk disappears, while its orifice is transformed into the coronary sinus, in which the great cardiac vein opens. The right smus of Cuvier, or superior vena cava, persists ; the transverse anastomosing branch between the two iuo-ulars becomes the left innominate vein, and the end of the right iuo-ular the right innominate. The venous circulation m the lower part of the embryo is at first carried on by the inferior cardinal veins, which return the blood from the Wolffian bodies, and receive branches corresponding to the intercostal, lumbar and crural veins. _ Between the fourth and fifth week, the inferior vena cava begins to appear in the form of a vessel which passes upwards behmd the liver and between the two Wolffian bodies. It anastomoses below with the two cardinal veins, and with the crural veins, which gradually come to open The middle part of the cardinal veins disappears; their distal extremities persist as the hypogastric veins, which open along with the crura into the vena cava, fouuLg the iliac and other veins of the lower extremities.DEVELOPMENT OP THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. cxxiii Tlie termination of each cardinal vein above, in the sinus of Cuvier, or superior cava, also persists. The central atrophied portion of the cardinal veins is replaced by a vein on either side, called posterior vertebral, which receive the intercostal and lumbar veins, and are soon united by an oblique anastomosing branch. The right vertebral vein, together with the persistent termination of the right cardinal vein, forms the great azygos vein. The distal portion of the lefb vertebral vein with the obhque anas- tomosing branch, forms the small azygos; and the upper part of the left vei-tebral, with the persistent termination of the left cardinal, forms the left superior intercostal vein. The 'foetal circulation' is spoken of at p. 663. Development of the alimentary canal. The development of the intestinal cavity is, as shown above, p. cxi., one of the earliest phenomena of embryonic life. This original intestine is closed at either end, and is at first in free communication with the umbilical vesicle (Fig. LIV., 3). It is divided into three parts: the anterior or cephalic portion of the primi- tive intestine, the middle, and the posterior or pelvic. From the first is Fig. LXL—^Diagram of the formation of the main systemic veins.

The buccal cavity on the one hand, and the lower portion of the rectum on the other, are separate pro- ductions from the external layer of the blastodermic membrane, and docxxiv GENERAL ANATOMY. not communicate witli the common cavity till a later period. Tlie pci-- nianence of the foetal septum in either case constitutes a well-known deformity—imperforate oesophagus or imperforate rectum, as the cas^ may be. The anal cavity is at first common to the urogenital, as w('ll as to the digestive organs. The development of the palate has been spoken of above. The tongue appears about the fifth week as a small elevation, behin.l the inferior maxillary arch, to which is united another projection from t]..- second pharyngeal arch. The epithelial layer is furnished by the external blastodermic membrane. The tonsils appear about the fourth month. The middle portion of the x^rimitive intestine is at first a straight tube, communicating freely with the umbiHcal vesicle. It then leaves the ver- tebral column in the middle, and forms a curve attached to that column by the mesentery. A portion of the intestine above this mesentery dilates into the stomach, which gradually also acquires a mesentery of its own; the rest remains attached to the spine, and forms the duodenum. The curve of the intestine appears as it were drawn out from the body by its attachment to the vitelline duct, and lies external to the parietes, and in the umbilical cord, until the end of the third month, when it passes back again into the abdomen. While still forming a portion of the cord, the hitestine begins to be distinguished into large and small, for the anterior or upper part, corresponding to the small intestine, begins to assume a convoluted arrangement about the eighth week, whilst the lower part, which had been posterior, passes to the front and right side of the other, and becomes dilated at a short distance from the insertion of the vitelline duct, to form the rudiment of the cjBCum. When the intestine lies wholly in the belly, the curve of the large intestine begins rapidly to form; but the Cfficum lies for some time in the middle line, and the ascending colon is not fully formed till the sixth month. The source of each layer of the intestine, and the closure of the ompha- lomesenteric or vitelline duct have been spoken of above, pp. civ., cvii. The liver appears after the Wolffian bodies, about the third week, m the form of two depressions formed by the epithelial and fibro-mtestmal layers of the blastodermic membrane, and projecting from the intestme at the part which afterwards forms the duodenum. These depressions are developed into the right and left lobes. They grow very rapidly around the omphalomesenteric vein, from which they receive the branches enume- rated on p. cxxii.,and about the third month the liver almost fills the abdominal cavity. From this period the relative development of he liver is less active, more especially that of the left lobe, which J^ow becomes smaller than the right; but the liver remains up to the end of f(Btai hte relatively larger than in the adult. , The gall bladder appears about the second month, and bile is detected in the intestine in the third month. ;i • xi ^ The pancreas is also an early formation, being far advanced m tlie second month. It, as well as the other salivary glands, which appea^ about the same period, originates in a projection from the epithelial lajer which afterwards forms a cavity, from the ramifications of which the lobules of the gland are formed.cxxv DEVELOPMENT OF GENITO-UBINARY ORGANS. Development of the res])iratory organs.—The lungs appear somewliat later than the liver. They are developed from a small cul-de-sac, which is : formed on either side as a projection from the epithelial and fibrous i laminte of the intestine. During the fourth week these depressions are I found on either side, opening freely into the pharynx, and from the original ! pouches other secondary pouches are given off, so that by the eighth week i the form of the lobes of the lungs mtty be made out. The two primary : pouches have a common pedicle of communication with the pharynx. This is developed into the trachea (Pig. LIX.), the cartilaginous rings of ; which are perceptible about the seventh week, the parts which after- wards form the larynx are recognised as early as the sixth week, viz.: a projection on either side of the pharyngeal opening, the rudiment of the arytenoid cartilages, and a transverse elevation from the third pharyngeal i arch, which afterwards becomes the epiglottis: the vocal cords and ventricles of the larynx are seen about the fourth month. The traces of , the diaphragm appear early, in the form of a fine membrane, separating ; the lungs from the Wolffian bodies, the stomach and liver, but the source of its formation has not been ascertained. The pleural and peritoneal cavities are then separated, having been common up to this time. The serous membrane of the pleura is formed about the tenth week; but its development is also unknown. Development of the genito-urinary organs.—The allantois communicates ; at first with the lower part of the primitive intestine by a canal—the urachus. After the second month the lower part of the urachus dilates, • so as to form the bladder, which then communicates above with the cavity of the urachus, and below with the rectum, by a canal of communication 'which is afterwards transformed into the urethra. The urachus is obliterated before the termination of foetal life ; but the cord formed by its obliteration is perceptible throughout life, passing from the upper ]3art of the bladder to the umbilicus. The kidneys are also formed from the lower end of the urachus. They lie at first (about the seventh week) behind and below the Wolffian body. ' As their distance from the bladder increases, the ureters become developed, and the simple culs-de-sac in which the foetal kidneys commence divide and subdivide so as to form lobulated organs provided with calices in their interior. This lobulation is perceptible for some time after birth. The mode of development of the ureters is not exactly known. Some embryologists describe them as extending gradually from the allantois upwards, so that the proper tissue of the kidney would be developed upon projections, or buds, out of the upper ends of the ureters. Others teach that the kidney tissue is formed before the ureter, and that the ducts of the former are hollowed out and open into the latter. Others, again, believe that the whole organ (kidney and ureter) is laid down in the same mass of blastema, which is at first solid, and that the various ducts or hollow spaces are formed in each part simultaneously. What is admitted is that the soHd blastema in which the Iddney commences comes to be arranged m a series of club-shaped bodies, which have their larger ends directed towards the hilum, and that these afterwards become hollow and open into the ureter, which has then also assumed the condition of a tube,cxxvi GENERAL ANATOMY. communicating witli the part of the aUantois afterwards converted into : the Wadder. As the future uriniferous tubes grow they become convo- ' luted, so that the whole subst-.uico of the kidney seems at first t(; resemble cortical tissue. Then the ends of the tubes become straight, and the pyramidal structure is developed. The suprarenal bodies are formed independently both of the kidneys and Wolffian bodies. ' , , ji 4i • i The Wolf an lochi, or primordial kidney, is perceptible about the third week forming a mass of cells which soon give rise to a hollow organ, situated on either side of the primitive vertebrte, and extending from the heart to the lower end of the embryo, terminating above in a mUU-mc and openiuo- befow into the bladder. The structure of the Wolffian body is m many respects analogous to that of the permanent kidney. It is composed partly of an excretory canal into which opeu numerous' conduits,' rectilinear at first, but afterwards tortuous, and partly of a cellular or glandular struc- ture in which Malpighian tufts are found. It is fixed to the diaphragm by a superior ligament, and to the spinal column by an inferior or lumbar lio-ament. Its office is the same as that of the kidneys, viz., to secrete fluid containing urea, which accumulates in the bladder. Wlien the permanent kidneys are formed, the greater part of the Wolffian body disappears. The rest takes part in the formation of the genital organs. ^ The Internal genital organs have at first no distinctive signs ot sex. i hey are developed from the Wolffian body, the genital gland, and the conduit of MliUer. The genital glands are masses of cells which are formed towards the sixth week of fcetal life. They are produced from the middle blasto- dermic layer, and lie on the inside of the Wolffian body, to which they ^ attached by a mesenteric layer of peritoneum. The conduit of Muller or genital duct, is formed at the same time as the genital gland and like it from the middle blastodermic layer. It is at first a mere cellular cord and then represents a canal, the upper part of which is closed; the lower opens into the bladder. It lies internal and anterior to the duct ot '"^T^ttll pint no difference of sex is perceptible ; but fi-om this stage, towards the commencement of the third month, the internal organs of the female and male begin to assume a different appearance.

Below this portion of the duct of Miiller, that body on either side, and I the ducts of the Wolffian body, are united together in a structure called ! ' the genital cord,' in which the two Mlillerian ducts approach each other, lying^'side by side and finally coalescing to form the cavity of the vagina i and uterus. This coalescence commences in the middle, corresponding to the body of the uterus. The upper parts of the Mlillerian ducts in the genital cord constitute the cornua of the uterus, little developed in the human species. The only remains of the Wolffian body consist in a struc- ture (parovarium or organ of Eosenmiiller) which can usually be detected lyipg between the ovary and Fallopian tube, and consisting of a group of tubules converging to a single diict, which is sometimes of considerable size and runs for some distance in the broad ligament. About the fifth month an annular constriction marks the position of I the neck of the uterus, and after the sixth month the walls of the uterus ! begin to thicken. The round ligament is derived from the lumbar ligament of the Wolffian j body, the superior ligament of the genital gland becomes the cord which ; attaches the ovary to the fimbriated extremitj^ of the Fallopian tube, the peritoneum constitutes the broad ligaments, the superior ligament of the Wolffian body disappears with that structure. Internal organs in the male.— I. The genital gland, in its development into a testicle, becomes rounded and thick, and is more vertical than the ovary is in its eax'ly state. The tubuli seminiferi are early visible, being at first short and straight, and then gradually assuming a coiled arrange- ment. The tunica albu^inea is formed about the third month. 2. The MiiUerian ducts disappear in the male sex, with the exception of their lower ends. These unite in the middle line, and open by a common orifice into the urogenital sinus. This constitutes the utriculus hominis or sinus prostaticus. 3. The head of the epididymis, its canal, the vas deferens and ejacu- latory duct, are formed from the canals and'from the duct of the Wolffian body. The remains of the W^olffian bodies also form the vas aberrans (see p. 713), and a structure described by Giraldes* and called after him, 'the organ of Giraldes,' which bears a good deal of resemblance to the organ of Eosenmiiller in the other sex. It consists of a number of convoluted tubules lying in the cellular tissue iu front of the cord and close to the head of the epididymis. The descent of the testis and the formation of the gubernaculum are described at p. 715, The External organs of generation, like the internal, pass through a stage in which there is no distinction of sex (Figs. LXIL, i. ii. iii.). We must therefore first describe this stage, and then follow the development of the female and male organs respectively. As stated above, the anal depression at an early period is formed by an involution of the external epithelium apart from the intestine, which is still closed at its lower end. When the septum between the two opens, which is about the fourth week, the urachus in front and the intestine be- y • Joimi. lie Phi/s., i86r.

About the second month a trans- verse division (the perinceum) begins to form and divides the cloaca into the anal cavity behind, and the urogenital sinus in front.

Male organs.—In the male, the changes are greater from the indifferent type. The genital tubercle is developed into the penis, the glans appear- ing in the third month, the prepuce and corpora cavernosa in the fourth. The genital furrow closes, and thus forms a canal, the spongy portion of the urethra. The urogenital sinus becomes elongated, and forms the prostatic and membranous urethra. The genital folds unite in the middle line, to form the scrotum, at about the same time as the genital furrow closes, viz., between the third and fourth month. The following table is translated from the work of Beaunis and Bou- chard, with some very unimportant alterations.* It will serve to present a resume of the above facts in an easily accessible form.

These are— The Spine or vertebral column (sacrum and coccyx included) . 26 Cranium o- Face 14 Os hyoides, sternum, and ribs 26 Upper extrenJities 64 Lower extremities 62 200 In this enumeration,, the patellas are included as separate bones, but the smaller sesamoid bones, and the ossicula auditus, are not reckoned. The teeth 1 belong to the tegumentary system. These bones are divisible into four classes-: Long, Short, Flat, and Irregular. The Long Bones are found in the limbs, vrhere they form a system of levers, I which have to sustain the weight of the trunk, and to confer the power of locomotion. ' A long bone consists of a lengthened cylinder or shaft, and two extremities. The shaft is a hollow cylinder, the walls consisting of dense compact tissue of great thickness in the middle, and becoming thinner towards the extremities ; the spongy tissue is scanty, and the bone is hollowed out in its interior to form the medtillary eanal. The extremities are generally somewhat expanded for greater convenience of mutual connection, for the purposes of articulation, and to afford a : broad surface for muscular attachment. Here the bone is made up of spongy tissue with only a thin coating of compact substance. The long bones are, the hwnerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpal, and metatarsal bones, and phalanges. The clavicle is also usually reckoned as a long bone. Short Bones. Where a part of the skeleton is intended for strength and com- pactness, and its motion is at the same time slight and limited, it is divided into a number of small pieces united together by ligaments, and the separate bones are short and compressed, such as the bones of the carpus and tarsus. These bones, in their structure, are spongy throughout, excepting at their surface, where there is a thin crust of compact substance. Flat Bones. Where the principal requirement is,either extensive pi'otection, or the provision of broad surfaces for muscular attachment, we find the osseous struc- ture expanded into, broad flat plates, as is seen in the bones of the skull and the shoulder-blade. These bones are composed of two thin layers of compact tissue, enclosing between them a variable quantity of cancellous tissue. In the cranial bones, these layers of compact tissue are familiarly known as the tables of the skull; the outer one is thick and tough; the inner one thinner, denser, and more brittle, I and hence termed the vitreous table. The intervening cancellous tissue is called the d^Aoii. The flat bones are, the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrymal, vomer, scapulas, ossa innom.inata, sternum, ribs, and patella. B2 THE SKELETON. The Irmjular or Mixed bones are such as, I'rom their peculiar form, cannot be grouped under either of the preceding heads. Their structure is similar to that of other bones, consisting of a layer of compact tissue externally, and of spongy cancellous tissue within. The irregular bones are, tho vertebral, sacrum, coccyx, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, malar, superior maxilla/ry, inferior max'dlary, palate, inferior turhinated, and hyoid. Surfaces of Bones. If the surface of any bone is examined, certain eminences and depressions are seen, to which descriptive anatomists have given the following names. „ . , , A prominent process projecting from the surface of a bone, which it has never been separate from, or moveable upon, is termed an apophysis (from (i7ro>v<nc, an excrescence) ; but if such process is developed as a separate piece froni the rest of tho bone, to which it is afterwards joined, it is termed an &piphysi8 (from tin- (hvfTiQ, an accretion). These eminences and depressions are of two kinds: articular, and non-articuLar. Well-marked examples of articular eminences are found in the heads of the humerus and femur; and of articular depressions, in the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and the acetabulum. Non-articular eminences are_ designated accordmg to their form. Thus, a broad, rough, uneven elevation is called a tuberosity; a small rough prominence, a tubercle; a sharp, slender, pointed eminence, a spine ; a narrow rougli elevation, running some way along the surface, a i-idge, ^The non-articular depressions are also of very variable form, and are described as fossfB, grooves, furrows, fissures, notches, etc. These non-articular eminences and depressions serve to increase the extent of surface for the attachment of ligaments and muscles, and are usually well marked in proportion to the muscularity of the subject. THE SPINE. The Spine is a flexuous and flexible column, formed of a series of bones called ^^*'ThT Vertebrae are thirty-three in number, exclusive of those which form the skull and have received the names cermcal, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeaL according to the position which they occupy; seven being found in the cervical region, twelve in the dorsal, five in the lumbar, five in the sacral, and four in the "'"""'TStumber is sometimes increased by an additional vertebra in one region, or the number may be diminished in one region, the deficiency being supplied by an addiSonal vertebra in another. These observations do not apply to the cervical portion of the spine, the number of bones forming which is seldom mcreased or *^™Thf Vertebrae in the upper three regions of the spine are separate through- out the whole of life ; but those found in the sacral and coccygea regions are, Tthe ad^t firmly united, so as to form two bones-five entering into the forma- t^n of the upper bone or sacrum, and four into the terminal bone of the spine or coccyx. GENERAt ChAKACTERS OF A VeRTEBRA. Each vertebra consists of two essential parts, an interior solid segment or body, aad a posterior segment or arch. The arch is formed of two pedicles, and two iTmin^: supporting seven processes; viz. four articular, two ti-ansverse, and one The bSb of the vertebra are piled one upon the other, forming a strong pillar for the support of the cranium and tn.nk; the arches forming a hollow Ser behind for the protection of the spinal cord.

Lastly, between each pair of vertebris apertures exist through which the spinal nerves pass fi-om the cord. Each of these constituent parts must now bo separately examined. i i i The Body is the largest and most solid part of a vertebra. Above and below, it is slightly concave, presenting a rim around its circumference ; and its upper and lower surfaces are rough, for the attachment of the intervertebral fibro-cartilages. In front, it is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards. Behind, it is flat from above downwards and slightly concave from side to side. Its anterior surface is perforated by a few small apertures, for the passage of nutrient vessels ; whilst, on the posterior surface, is a single large irregulSr aperture, or occasionally more than one, for the exit of veins from the body of the vertebra, the vence basis vertebral. The Pedicles project backwards, one on each side, from the upper part of the body of the vertebra, at the line of junction of its posterior and lateral surfaces. The concavities above and below the pedicles are the intervertebral notches ;. they are foui* in number, two on each side, the inferior ones being generally the deeper. When the vertebrae are articulated, the notches of each contiguous pair of bones form the intervertebral foramina which communicate with the spinal canal and transmit the spinal nerves. The Lamince are two broad plates of bone which complete the vertebral arch behind, enclosing a foramen which serves for the protection of the spinal cord ; they are connected to the body by means of the pedicles. Their mpper and lo-wer- borders are rough, for the attachment of the liga/inenta subfiava. The Articular Processes, four in number, two on each side, spring from the' junction of the pedicles with the laminis. The two superior project upwards,- their articular surfaces being directed more or less backwards; the two inferior project downwards, their articular surfaces looking more or less forwards.* The Spinous Process projects backwards from the junction of the two laminsev and serves for the attachment of muscles. The Transverse Processes, two in number, project one at each side from the point where the articular processes join the pedicle. They also serve for the' attachment of muscles.

The Iwrnma^ are narrow lono- thinner above than below, and overlap each other; enclosing the spinal foramen, which is very large, and of a triangular form. The spinous processes are short and bifid at the extremity, to afford greater extent of surfaxje for the attachment of muscles, the two divisions being often of unequal size. They increase in length from the fourth to the seventh. The tramverse processes arc short directed downwards, outwards, and forwards, bifid at their extremity, and marked by a groove along their upper surface, which runs downwards and out- wards from the superior intervertebral notch, and serves for the transmission ot one of the cervical nerves. The transverse processes are pierced at their base by a foramen, for the transmission of the vertebral artery, vein, and plexus of nerves. Eacb process is formed by two roots : the anterior root arises from the side of the body and corresponds to the ribs: the posterior root springs from the junction ot the iiedicle with the lamina, and corresponds with the transverse processes m tlie dorsal re-ion It is by the junction of the two that the foramen for the vertebral vessels is^'formed. The extremities of each of these roots form the anterior and postenor tubercles of the transverse processes. The articular processes are oblique : the superior are of an oval form, flattened and directed upwards and backwards; tbe inferior downwards and forwards. i The peculiar vertebrsB in the cervical region are the first or Ailas ; the second or Axis • and the seventh or Vertelra prominens.

These grooves represent the superior intervertebral notches, and are peculiar from being situated behind the articular processes, instead of before them, as m the other vertebras. They serve for the transmission of the vertebral artery, which as- cending through the foramen in the transverse process, winds round the latera mass in a direction backwards and inwards. They also transmit the sub-occipital nerves. On the under surface of the posterior arch, in the same situation, are two other grooves, placed behind the lateral masses, and representing the inferior intervertebral notches of other vertebra. They are much less marked than the superior. The lateral masses are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, m order to support the weight of the head ; they present two articulating processes above, and two below. The two superior are of large size, oval, concave, and approach towards one another in front, but diverge behind; they are directed up- wards, inwards, and a little backwards, forming a kind of cup for the condyles of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. Not unfrequently they are partially subdivided by a more or less deep indentation which encroaches upon each lateral margin. The inferior articular processes are circular in form, flattened or slightly concave, and directed down- wards, inwards, and a little backwards, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements. Just below the inner margin of each superior articular surface is a small tubercle, for the attachment of a ligament which, stretching across the ring of the atlas, divides it into two unequal parts ; the anterior or smaller segment receiving the odontoid process of the axis, the posterior allowing the transmission of the spinal cord and its membranes. This part of the spinal canal is of considerable size, to afford space for the spinal cord; and hence lateral displacement of the atlas may occur without compression of the spinal cord. The transverse processes are of large size, for the attachment of special muscles which assist in rotating the head—long, not bifid, perforated at their base by a canal for the vertebral artery, which is directed from below, upwards and backwards.

Seventh Cervical (fig. 4)- The most distinctive character of this vertebra is the existence of a very long and prominent spinous pro- cess; hence the name 'Yertebra prominens.' This process is^thipk, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, and has attached to it the ligamentum nuchee. The trans- verse process is usually of large size, especially its posterior root; its upper surface has usually a shallow groove, and it seldom pre- sents more than a trace of bifurca- tion at its extremity. The vertebral foramen is sometimes as large as in the other cervical vertebr{B, usually smaller, on one or both sides, and sometimes wanting. On. the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on 4.—7th Cervical Vertebra, or Vertebra Prominens.

The transverse processes anse from the same parts of the arch as the posterior roots of the transverse processes in the neck; they are thick, strong and of great length, directed obliquely backwards and outwards, presenting a clubbed extremity, which is tipped on its anterior part by a small concave surface, for articulation with the tubercle ot a rib. Besides the articular facet for the rib, two indistinct tubercles may be seen risino- from the extremity of the transverse processes, one near the upper, the other uearlihe lower border. In man, they are comparatively of small size, and serve only for the attachment of muscles. But, in some animals, they attain considerable magnitude either for the purpose of more closely connecting the segments of this portion of the spine, or for muscular and ligamentous attachment. The spinous processes are long, triangular in form, directed obliquely downwards, and termi- nating by a tubercular margin. They overlap one another from the fifth to the eighth, but are less oblique in direction above and below. JSuperioT Artie.

Chaiuctees of the Lumbar VERTEBEiE. The Lumbar Vertebra (fig. 7) are the largest segments of the vertebral column The body is large, broader from side to side than from before backwards about equal in depth in front and behind, flattened or slightly concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and at the sides, presenting promx- 7.—Lumbar Vertebra, Super. Artic\ troc nent margins, which afford a broad basis for the support of the superincumbent weight. The pedicles are very strong, directed backwards from the upper part of the bodies; consequently the inferior interyertebral notches are of large size. The laminre are short, but broad and strong ; and the foramen triangular, larger than in the dorsal, smaller than in the cervical region. The superior articular processes are concave, and look almost directly inwards ; the inferior, convex, look outwards and a little forwards ; the former are separated by a much wider interval than the latter, embracing the lower articulating processes of the vertebra above. The transverse processes are long, slender, directed transversely outwards in the upper three lumbar vertebrae, slanting a little upwards in the lower two. By some anatomists they are considered homologous with the ribs. Of the two tubercles noticed in connection with the transverse processes in the dorsal region, the superior ones become connected in this region with the back part of the superior articular processes. Although in man they are comparatively small, in some animals th«y attain considerable size, and serve to lock the vertebras mofS closely together. The spinous processes are thick and broad, somewhat quadri- lateral, horizontal in direction, thicker below than above, and terminating by a rough uneven border. The 'Fijih Ltmhxr vertebra is characterised by having the body much thicker in front than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacro-vertcbral articulation, by the smaller size of its spinous process, by the wide interval between the inferior articulating processes, and by the greater size and thickness of its transverse processes. Structure of the Vertehrce. The structure of a vertebra differs in different parf s. The body is composed of Hght spongy cancellous tissue, having a thin coating of compact tissue on its external 'surfaco perforated by numerous orifices, some of large size, for the passage of vessels ; its interior is traver.sed by one or two largo canals for the reception of veins, which converge towards a single large irregular orTHE SKELETON. lO several small apertures at the posterior part of the body of each bone. The arch and processes projecting from it have, on the contrary, an exceedingly thick cover- ing of compact tissue. , Developmefit. Each vertebra is formed of three primary cartilaginous portions (fig. 8), one for each lamina and its processes, and one for the body. Ossification commences in. the laminno about g - • . ~ — . . the sixth week of fcotal liCe, ni the situation where the trans- verse processes afterwards pro- ject, the ossific granules shooting backwards to the spine, forwards to the body, and outwards into the transverse and articular pro- cesses. Ossification in the body commences in the middle of the cartilage about the eighth week. At birth these three pieces are perfectly separate. During the first year the laminae become united behind, by a portion of cartilage in which the spinous process is ultimately formed, and thus the arch is completed. About the third year the body is joined to the arch on each side, in such a manner that the body is formed from the three original centres of ossification, the amount contributed by the pedicles increasing in extent from below upwards. Thus the bodies of the sacral vertebra are formed almost entirely from the central nuclei, the bodies of the lumbar are formed laterally and behind by the pedicles ; in the dorsal region, the pedicles advance as far forwards as the articular depressions for the heads of the ribs, forming these cavities of reception; and in the neck the lateral portions of the bodies are formed entirely by the advance of the pedicles. Be- fore puberty, no other changes occur, excepting a gradual in- crease in the growth of these primary centres, the upper and under surfaces of the bodies, and the ends of the transverse and spinous processes, being tipped with cartilage, in which ossific granules are not as yet deposited. At sixteen years (fig. 9), four secondary centres appear, one for the tip of each transverse process, and two (sometimes Development of a Vertebra.

At twenty-one years (fig. lo) a thin circular epiphysal plate of bone is formed in the layer of cartilage situated on the upper and under surfaces of the body, the former being the thicker of the two. All these become joined; and the bone is completely formed about the thirtieth year of life. . , „ , j j Exceptions to this mode of development occur m the first, second, and seventh cervical, and in the vertebraa of the lumbar region. The Atlas (fig. ii) is developed by two primary centres, and by one or more epiphyses. The two primary centres are destined for the two lateral^ or neural masses, the ossification of which commences before birth, near the articular pro- cesses, and extends backwards : these portions of bone are separated from one another behind, at birth, by a narrow interval filled in with cartilage. Between the second and third years, they unite either directly or through the medium of an epiphysal centre, developed in the cartilage near their point of junction. The anterior arch, at birth, is altogether cartilaginous, and this portion of the atlas is completed by the gradual extension forwards and ultimate junction of the two neural processes. Occasionally, a separate nucleus is developed in the anterior arch, which, extending laterally, joins the neural processes in front of the pedicles ; or, there are two nuclei developed in the anterior arch, one on either side of the median line, wljich join to form a single mass, afterwards united to the lateral portions in front of the articulating processes. The Axis (fig. 12) is developed by stic centres. The body and arch of this bone are formed in the same manner as the corresponding parts in the other vertebrae : one centre for the lower part of the body, and one for each lamina. The odontoid process consists originally of ian extension upwards of the cartilaginous mass, in which the lower part of the body is formed. At about the sixth month of foetal life, two osseous nuclei make their appearance in the base of this process : they are placed laterally, and join before birth to form a conical birlobed mass deeply cleft above ; the interval between the cleft and the summit of the process is formed by a wedge-shaped piece of cartilage ; the base of the process being separated from the body by a cartilaginous interval, which gradually becomes ossified, sometimes by a separate epiphysal nucleus. Finally, as Dr. Humphry has demonstrated, the apex of the odontoid process has a separate nucleus. The Seventh Cervical, The anterior or costal part of the transverse process of the seventh cervical, is developed from a separate osseous centre at about the sixth month of foetal life, and joins the body and posterior division of the trans- Terse process between the fifth and sixth years. Sometimes this process continues as a separate piece, and, becoming lengthened out'jyards, constitutes what is known as a cervical rib. The Lumiar Vertebrce (fig. 13) have ttvo adfJAtional centres (besides those peculiar to the vertebrae generally), for the tubercles, which project from the back part of the superior articular processes. The transyerse process of the first lumbar is sometimes developed as a separate piece, which may remain permanently uncon- nected with the remaining portion of the bone ; thus forming a lumbar rib, a peculiarity which is rarely met with. Progress op Ossification in the Spine Generally. Ossification of the laminBs of the vertebrae commences at the upper part of the spine, and proceeds gradually downwards ; hence the frequent occurrence of spina bifida in the Ipwer part of the spinal column. Ossification of the bodies, on the other hand, commences a little below the centre of the spinal column (about the ninth or tejith dorsal vertebra?), and extends both upwards and downwards. Although, however, the oesific nuclei make their first appearance in the lower dorsal vertebrse, the lumbar and first sacral are those in which these nuclei are largest at bu-th.

At each end of the ridges above- mentioned, are seen the anterior sacral foramina, analogous to the intervertebral foramina, four in number on each side, somewhat rounded in form, diminish- ing in size fi'om above downwards, and directed outwards and forwards ; they transmit the anterior branches of the sacral nerves. External to these fora- mina is the lateral mass, consisting, at an early period of life, of separate seg- ments, which correspond to the ante- rior transverse processes ; these become blended, in the adult, with the bodies, with each other, and with the posterior transverse processes. Each lateral mass is traversed by four broad shallow grooves, which lodge the anterior sacral nerves as they pass outwards, the grooves- being separated by prominent ridges of bone, which give attachment to the slips, of the Pyriformis muscle. ,If a vertical section is made through the centre of the bone (fig. 15), the- bodies are seen to be united at their- circumference by bone, a wide interval being left centrally, which, in the recent state, is filled by intervertebral sub- stance. In some bones, this union is- more complete between the lower seg- ments than between the upper ones. The Posterior Surface (fig. 16) is convex and much narrower than the anterior.- In the middle line are three or four tubercles, which represent the rudimentary spinous processes of the sacral vertebrae. Of these tubercles, the first is usually prominent, and perfectly distinct from the rest; the second and third are either- separate, or united into a tubercular ridge, which diminishes in size from above downwards; the fourth usually, and the fifth always, remaining undeveloped. External to the spinous processes on each side, are the lamina}, broad and well marked! in the first three pieces; sometimes the fourth, and generally the fifth, being un- developed ; in this situation the lower end of the sacral canal is exposed. External to the laminsB is a linear series of indistinct tubercles representing the articulan- processes ; the upper pair are large, well developed, and correspond in shape and direction to the superior articulating processes of a lumbar vertebra ; the second and third are small; the fourth and fifth (usually blended together) are situated.14 THE SKELETON. on each side of the sacral canal: they are called the sacral cornua, and articulate with the cornua of the coccyx. E.\ternal to the articular processes are the four posterior sacral foramina ; they are smaller in size and less regular in form than the anterior, and transmit the posterior branches of the sacral nerves.

This orifice is formed behind by the spinous process and lamin«e of the first sacral vertebra whilst projectmg from it on each side are the superior articular processes; they are oval, concave, directed backwards and inwards, like the superior articular processes of a lumbar vertebra; and in front of each articular process is an intervertebral notch, which forms the lower half of the last intervertebral foramen. Lastly, on each side ot the articular surface is a broad and flat triangular surface of bone, which extends outwards, and is continuous on each side with the iliac fossa. The Aj^ex, directed downwards and forwards, presents a small oval concave surface for articulation with the coccyx. •, • 1 The Sacral Canal runs throughout the greater part of the bone ; it is large and triangular in form above, small and flattened from before backwards below.

The sacrum in the female is usually wider thaD in the male ; and it is much less curved, the upper half of the bone being nearly straight, the lower half presenting the sreatest amount of curvature. The CD bone is also directed more obliquely backwards ; which increases the size of the pelvic cavity, and forms a more prominent sacro-vertebral angle. In the male, the curvature is more evenly At 4^ years. j distributed over the whole length of the bone, and is altogether greater than in the female. Peculiarities of the Sacr¥m. This bone, in some cases, consists of six pieces; occasionally, the number is re- duced to four. Sometimes the bodies of the first and second segments are ig not joined, or the laminsB and spinous processes have not coalesced. Occa- 2 Epiphjsal laminit sionally, the upper pair of transverse for each lateral surface. * tuberclcs are not joined to the rest of the bone on one or both sides ; and lastly, the sacral canal may be open for nearly the lower half of the bone, in consequence of the imperfect develop- at 25 ^ MS - — ment of the lamince and spinous pro- cesses. The sacrum, also, varies con- siderably with respect to its degree of curvature. From the examination of a large number of skeletons, it would appear, that, in one set of cases, the anterior surface of this bone was nearly straight, the curvature, which was very 18.i6 THE SKELETON. slight,, affecting only its lower end. In another set of cases, the bono was curved throughout its whole length, but especially towards its middle. In a third set, the degree of curvature was less marked, and affected especially the lower third of the bone, Bevclofmenl (fig. 17). The sacrnm, forniod by the union of five vertebras, has thiriij-fivG centres of ossification. The lodies of the sacral vertebras have each three ossific centres; one for the central part, and one for the epiphysal plates on its upper and under surface. The arch of each sacral vertebra is developed by two centnss, one for each lamina. These unite with each other behind, and subsequently join the body. The lateral masses have six additional centres, two for eacli of the first three vertebras. These centi-es make their appearance above and to the outer side of the anteHor sacral foramina (fig. 17), and are developed into separate segments, which correspond with the anterior transverse processes (fig. 18) ; they are subse- quently blended with each other, and with the bodies and the posterior transverse processes, to form the lateral mass. Lastly, each lateral surface of the sacrum is developed by two epiphysal plates (fig. 19) ;'one for the auricular surface, and one for the remaining part of the thin lateral edge of the bone. n p f . •« Penod of Developvient. At about the eighth or nmth week of fcetal life, ossifa- cation of the central part of the bodies of the first three vertebraa commences ; and at a somewhat later period, that of the last two. Between the sixth and emhih months ossification of the laminae takes place; and, at about the same period the characteristic osseous tnbercles for the first three sacral vertebrae make their appearance. The laminae join to form the arcb, and are umted to the bodies, first in the lowest vertebrge. This occurs about the second year, the uppermost segment appearing as a single piece about the fifth or sixth year. About the six- teenth year the epiphyses for the upper and under surfaces of the bodies are formed and, between the eighteenth and twentieth years, those for each lateral surface of the sacrum make their appearance. At about this period the last two segments are joined to one another; and this process gradually ex- tending upwards, all the pieces become united, and the bone is completely formed from the twenty- fifth to the thirtieth year of life.

The apex is rounded, and has attached to it the tendon of the external Sphincter muscle. It is occasionally bifad, and sometimes deflected to one or other side. _ Development. The coccyx is developed by fmir centres, one for each piece. Occasionally, one of the first three pieces of this bone is developed by two centres, placed side by side. The ossific nuclei make their appearance m the following order • in the first segment, at birth ; in the second piece, at from five to ten years ; in the third, from ten to fifteen years ; in the fourth, from fifteen to twenty years. As age advances, these various segments become united in the following order: the first two pieces join ; then the third and fourth; and, lastly, the bone is com- pleted by the union of the second and third. At a late period of life, especially in females, the coccyx often becomes joined to the end of the sacrum. Articulation. With the sacrum. Attachment of Muscles.

The spinal column, formed by the junction of the vertebriB, is situated in the median hue, at the posterior part of the trunk : its average length is about two feet two or three inches, measured along the curved anterior surface of the column. Of this length the cervical part measures alaout five, the dorsal about eleven, the lumbar about seven inches, and the sacrum and coccyx the remainder. Viewed in front, it presents two pyramids joined together at their bases, the upper one being formed by all the vertebraa from the second cervical to the last lumbar ; the lower one by the sacrum and coccyx. When examined more closely, the upper pyramid is seen to be formed of three smaller pyramids. The upper- most of these consists of the six lower cervical vertebrae ; its apex being formed by the axis or second cei-vical; its base, by the first dorsal. The second pyramid, which is inverted, is formed by the four upper dorsal vertebra), the base being at the first dorsal, the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually increases in size to the fifth lumbar. Viewed laterally (fig. 21), the spinal column presents several curves, which cor- respond to the different regions of the column, and are called cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and pehic. The cervical curve commences at the apex of the odontoid process, and terminates at the middle of the second dorsal vertebra ; it is convex in front, and is the least marked of all the curves. The dorsal curve, which is concave forwards, commences at the middle of the second, and- terminates at the 0prorainont point behind corresponds to i8 THE SKELETON. 21.—Lateral View of the Spine. middle of the twelfth dorsal. Its most the body of the seventh or eighth verte- bra. The lumhar curve commences at the middle of the last doi-sal vertebra, and terminates at the sacro-vertebral angle. It is convex anteriorly ; the convexity of the lower three vertebras being much greater than that of the upper ones. The pelvic curve commences at the sacro-ver- tebral articulation, and terminates at the point of the coccyx. It is concave an- teriorly. These curves are partly due to the shape of the bodies of the vertebrae, and partly to the intervertebral substances, as will be explained in the Articulations of the Spine. The spine has also a slight lateral curvature, the convexity of wbich is di- rected toward the right side. This is most probably produced, as Bichat first explained, chiefly by muscular action; most person^ using the right arm in preference to the left, especially in making long-continued efforts, when the body is curved to the right side. In support of this explanation, it has been found, by Beclard, that in one or two individuals ■who were left-handed, the lateral curva- ture was directed to the left side. The spinal column presents for exami- nation an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral surfaces; a base, summit, and ver- tebral canal. The anterior surface presents thebodies of the vertebrge separated in the recent state by the intervertebral discs. The bodies are broad in the cervical region, narrow in the upper part of the dorsal, and broadest in the lumbar region. The whole of this surface is convex transversely, concave from above down- wards in the dorsal region, and convex in the same direction in the cervical and lumbar regions. The posterior surface presents in the median line the spinous processes. These are short, horizontal, with bifid extremi- ties in the cervical region. In the dorsal region, they are directed obliquely above, assume almost a vertical direction in the middle, and are horizontal below, as are also the spines of the lumbar vertebras. They are separated by considerable in- tervals in the loins, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the dorsal region, Occa-THE SKULL. 19 sionally one of these processes deviates a little from the median line a fact to L remeX-ed in practice, as irregularities of this sort are attendant also on frac- ture ox dtpVacenfents of the spine.

These surfaces present in front the sides of the bodies of the vertebra), marked m the dorsal region by the facets for articulation with the heads of the ribs. More posteriorly are the intervertebral foramina, formed by the juxtaposition of the inter- vertebral notches, oval in shape, smallest in the cervical and upper part of the dorsal regions, and gradually increasing in size to the last lumbar. They are situated between the transverse processes in the neck, and in front of them in the back and loins, and transmit the spinal nerves. The lase of the vertebral column is formed by the under surface of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra; and the srnnmit by the upper surface of the atlas. The vertehral or spinal canal follows tbe different curves of the spine; it is largest in those regions in which the spine enjoys the greatest freedom of movement, as in the neck and loins, where it is wide and triangular ; and narrow and rounded in the back, where motion is more limited. THE SKULL. The Skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column, is composed of four vertebrse, the elementary parts of which are specially modified in form and size, and almost immoveably connected, for the reception of the brain, and special organs of the senses. These vertebrae are the occipital, parietal, fi-ontal, and nasal. Descriptive anatomists, however, divide the skull into two parts, the Cranium and the Face. The Cranium {updvoc, a helmet), is composed of eight bones : viz., the occipital, two parietal, frontal, two temporal, sphenoid, and ethmoid. The face is composed of fourteen bones : viz., the two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, two malar, two palate, two inferior tiirhinated, vomer, and inferior maxillary. The ossicula auditus, the teeth, and Wormian hones, are not included in this enumeration. Occipital. Cranium, 8 hones. <^ Shull, 22 hones. < Face, 14 hones. <( Two Parietal. Frontal. Two Temporal.

On the outer side of each condyle, near its fore part, is a foramen, the anterior condyloid ; it is directed downwards, outwards and forwai-ds, and transmits the hypoglossal nerve, and occasionally a meniugeal branch ot the ascendincr pharyngeal artery. This foramen is sometimes double. Behind eacH condyle is a fossa,* sometimes perforated at the bottom by a foramen, the posterior condyloid, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the foramen magnum is a strong quadrilateral plate of bone, the basilar process, wider behind than in front; its under surface, which is rough, presentmg in the median Hne a tubercular ridge, the pharyngeal spine, for the attachment of the tendinous raphe and Superior constrictor of the pharynx ; and, on each side of it, rough depressions for the attachment of the Recti capitis antici, major and minor. The Internal or Cerebral Surface (fig. 23) is deeply concave. The posterior or occipital pai-t is divided by a crucial ridge into four fosste. The two superior fossa? receive the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, and present shght eminences and depressions corresponding to their convolutions. The two inferior, which receive the hemispheres of the cerebellum, are larger than the former, and comparatively smooth ; both are marked by slight grooves for the lodgment of arteries. At the point of meeting of the four divisions of the crucial ridge is an eminence, the internal occipital protuberance. It nearly corresponds to that on the outer surface, and is perforated by one or more large vascular foramina. From this eminence, the superior division of the crucial ridge run,s upward to the superior angle of the bone; it presents a deep groove for the superior longitudinal sinus, the margins of which give attachndent to the falx cerebri. The in- ferior division, the internal occipital crest, runs to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, on the edge of which it becomes gradually lost; this ridge, which is bifurcated below, serves for the attachment of the falx cerebelli. It is usually marked by two small grooves, which commence on either side of the • posterior margin of the foramen magnum, join together above, and run into the depression for the Torcular Herophili. They lodge the occipital sinuses. The transverse grooves pass outwards to the lateral angles ; they are deeply channelled, for the lodgment of the lateral sinuses, their prominent margins affording attach- ment to the tentorium cerebelli.f At the point of meeting of these grooves is a , depression, the ' Torcular Herophili,' J placed a little to one or the other side of the internal occipital protuberance. More anteriorly is the foramen magnum, and * This fossa presents many variations iu size. It is usually shallow; and the foramen small; occasionally wantinij, on one, or both sides. Sometimes both fossa and foramen are large, but confined to one side only ; more rarely, the fossa and foramen are very large on both sides. t Usually one of the transverse grooves is deeper and broader than the other; occasionally, both grooves are of equal depth and breadth, or both equally iudistiuct. The 'broader of the two transverse grooves is nearly always continuous with the vertical groove for the superior longitudinal sinus, and occupies tlio correspon'ding side of the median line.

At this part of the internal surface there is a very deep groove, in which the posterior condyloid foramen, when it exists, has its internal termination. This groove is continuous in the complete skull with that which separates the upper from the lower fossro, and lodges the end of the same sinus, the lateral. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, presenting a shallow depression, the basilar groove, which slopes from behind, upwards and forwards, and supports the medulla oblongata and part of the Pons Varolii, and on each side of the basilar process is a narrow channel, which, when united with a 23.—Occipital Bone.

The superior angle is received into the interval between the posterior superior angles of the two parietal bones : it corresponds with that part of the skull in the foetus which is called the posteiior fontanelle. The infenor angle is represented by the square-shaped surface of the basilar process. At an early period of life, a layer of cartilage separates this part of the bone from the sphenoid ; but in the adult, the union between them is osseous The lateral males correspond to the outer ends of the transverse grooves, and are received into the interval between the posterior inferior angles of the parietal and the mastoid portion of the temporal.23 PARIETAL BONE.

At birth, the bone consists of four parts, separate from one another, the occipital portion being fissured in the direction indicated in the plate above. At about the fourth year, the occipital and the two condyloid pieces join; and about the sixth year, the bone consists ot a single piece. At a later period, between the eighteenth and twenty-fafth years, the occipital and sphenoid become united, forming a single bone. Articulations.

The external surface (fig. 25) is convex, smooth, and marked about Its centre by an eminence', called tlie parietal eminence, which indicates the point where ossitication commenced. Crossing the 7niddle of the bone in an arched direction is a curved ridge, the temporal ridge, for the attachment of the temporal fascia. Above this ridge, the surface of the bone is rough and porous, and covered by the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis ; below it the bone is smooth, forms part of the temporal fossa, and ailbrds attachment to tlnj temporal muscle. At the back part of the superior border, close to the sagittal suture, is a small foramen, the parietal foramen, which transmits a vein to tlie superior lono-itudinal sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital artery. Its existence is not constant, and its size varies considerably. The internal surface (fig.. 26), concave, presents eminences and depressions for lodging the convolutions of the cerebrum, and numerous furrows for the ramifica- tions of the meningeal arteries; the latter run upwai-ds and Ijackwards from the anterior inferior angle, and from the central and postei-ior part of the lower border of the bone. Along the upper margin is part of a shallow groove, which, when joined to the opposite parietal, forms a channel for the superior longitudinal sinus, the elevated edges of which afford attachment to the falx cerebri. Near the groove are seen several depressions; they lodge the Pacchionian bodies. The internal opening of the parietal foramen is also seen when that aperture exists. 25.—Left Parietal Boue.

The anterior superior, thin and pointed, corresponx3s with that portion of the skull -which in the foetus is membranous, and is called the anterior fontanelie. The antenor inferior angle is thin and lengthened, being received in the interval be- tween the great wing of the sphenoid and the frontal. This point will be found about one inch behind the upper and outer angle of the orbit. Its inner surface is marked by a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. The posterior superior angle corresponds with the junctioji of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. In the foetus this part of the skull is membranous, and is called the posterior fontanelie. The posterior inferior angle articulates with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and generally presents on its inner surface a broad shallow groove for lodging part of the lateral sinus. Development. The parietal bone is formed in membrane, being developed by one centre, which corresponds with the parietal eminence, and makes its first appearance about the fifth or sixth week of foetal life. Ossification gradually extends from the centre to the circumference of the bone : the angles are consequently the parts last formed, and it is in their situation, that the fontanelles exist, previous to the com- pletion of the growth of the bone.

This bono, wliicU rosomblos a cocklo-shell in form, consists of two portions—a vertical ov frontal portion, situated at the anterior part of the cranium, forming the forehead ; and a horizontal or orbilo-nasal portion, which enters into the formation of the roof of the orbits and nose. Vertical Portion. External Surface (fig. 27). In tlic median line, traversing the bone from the upper to the lower part, is occaBionally seen a slightly elevated ridge, and in young subjects a suture, which represents the line of union of tlie two late- ral halves of which the bone consists at an early period of life : in the adult this suture is usually obliterated, and the bone forms one piece : traces of the obliterated suture are, however, generally perceptible at the lower part. On either side of this ridge, a little below the centre of the bone, is a rounded eminence, the frontal emi- nence. Those eminences vary in size in different individuals, and are occasionally unsymmetrical in the same subject. They are especially prominent in cases of well- 27,—Frontal Bone. Outer Surface.

Below the frontal'eminence, and separated from it by a slight groove, is the superciliary ridge, broad internally where it is continuous with the nasal eminence, but less distmct as it arches outwards. These ridges are caused by the projection outwards of the fron- tal sinuses,* and give attachment to the Orbicularis palpebrarum and Corrugator Bupercilii.

Along the middle line is a vertical groove, the edges of which unite below to form a ndge the frontal crest, the groove lodges the superior longitudinal sinus, whilst its edges afford attacH- ment to the falx cerebri. The crest terminates below at a small opening, the foramen coscum, which is generally completed behind by the ethmoid. This•<8S THE SKELETON. foramen varies in size in diffcvent subjects, is usually partially or completely impervious, lodges a process of the falx cerebri, and, when open, transmits a vein from the lining-membrane of the nose to the superior longitudinal sinus. On either side of the groove, the bone is deeply concave, presenting eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the brain, and numerous small furrows for lodging the ramifications of tho anterior meningeal arteries. Several small, irregular fossiB are also seen on either side of the groove, for the reception of the *PacchIonian bodies. Horizontal Portion. External Surface. This portion of the bone consists of two thin plates, which form the vault 6f the orbits, separated from one another by the ethmoidal notch. Each orbital vault consists of a smooth, concave, triangular plate of bone, marked at its anterior and external part (immediately beneath the external angular process) by a shallow depression, the lachrymal fossa, for lodgmg the lachrymal gland ; and at its anterior and internal part, by a depression (some- times a small tubercle) for the attachment of the fibrous pulley of the Superior oblique muscle. The ethmoidal notch separates the two orbital plates; it is quadrilateral; and filled up, when the bones are united, by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The margins of this notch present several half-cells, whicb, when united with corresponding half-cells on the upper surface of the ethmoid, complete the ethmoidal cells ; two grooves are also seen crossing these edges transversely ; they are converted into canals by articulation with the ethmoid, and are" called the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals ; they open on the inner walls of the orbit. The anterior one transmits the nasal nerve and anterior ethmoidal vessels, the pos- terior one the posterior ethmoidal vessels. In front of the ethmoidal notch is the nasal spine, a sharp-pointed eminence, which projects downwards and forwards, and articulates in front with the crest of the nasal bones; behind, it is marked by two grooves, separated by a vertical ridge; the ridge articulates with the perpendicular lamellse of the ethmoid, the grooves form part of the roof of the nasal foss^. On either side of the base of the nasal spine are the openings of the frontal sinuses. These are two irregular cavities, which extend upwards and outwards, a variable distance, between the two tables of the skull, and are separated fi-om one another by a thin bony septum. They give rise to the prominences above the root ot the nose called the nasal emmences and suferciliary ridges. In the child they are gene- rally absent, and they become gradually developed as age advances. These cavities ;ary in size in difiFerent persons, are larger in men than in women, and are frequently of unequal size on the two sides, the left being commonly the larger. Occasionally, they are subdivided by incomplete bony laming. They are hned by mucous membrane, and communicate with the nose by the mfundibulum, and occa- sionally with each other by apertures in their septum. The Internal Surface of the Horizontal Portwn presents the convex upper surface of the orbital plates, separated from each other in the middle hue by the ethmoidal notch, and marked by eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the anterior ^""^^ord^l ^Treborder of the vertical portion is thick, strongly serrated bevelled at the expense of the internal table above, where it rests upon the panetal bones and at the expense of the external table at each side, where it receives th latera pressure of those bones : this border is continued below into a ^^"^"f ^^^^ surface, which articulates with the great wmg of the sphenoid- The ^ovdev the hodzontal portion is thin, serrated, and articulates with the lesser wmg of the '^^Itei^r..

Its outer surface is smooth, convex, and grooved at its back part for the deep temporal arteries ;30 THE SKELITTON. it affords attachment to the Temporal muscle, aud forms part of the temporal fossa. At its back pai't may be seen a curved ridge—part of the temporal ridge ; it serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia, limits the origin of the Temporal muscle, and marks the boundary between the squamous and mastoid portions of the bone. Projecting from the lower part of the squamous portion is a long arched outgrowth of bone, the zygomatic process. This process is at first directed out- wards, its two surfaces looking upwards and downwards; it then appears as if twisted upon itself, and runs forwards, its surfaces now looking inwards and out- wards. The superior border of the process is long, thin, and sharp, and serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia. The inferior, short, thick, and arched, has attached to it some fibres of the Masseter muscle. Its outer surface is convex and subcutaneous; its inner is concave, and also affords attachment to the Masseter. The exti'emity, broad and deeply serrated, articulates with the malar bone. The zygomatic process is connected to the temporal bone by three divisions, called its roots—an anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior, which is short but broad and strong, runs transversely inwards into a rounded eminence, the eminentia articularis. This eminence forms the front boundary of the glenoid fossa, and in the recent state is covered with cartilage. The middle root forms the outer margin of the glenoid cavity; running obliquely inwards, it terminates at the commencement of a well-marked fissure, the Glaserian fissure ; whilst the posterior root, which is strongly marked, runs from the upper border of the zygoma, in an arched direction, upwards and backwards, forming the posterior part of the tempo- ral ridge. At the junction of the anterior root with the zygoma is a projection, called the hthercle, for the attachment of the exteraal lateral ligament of the lower jaw; and between the anterior and middle roots is an oval depression, forming part of the glenoid fossa (yXip'V, a sochet), for the reception of the condyle of the lower jaw. Tliis fossa is bounded, in front, by the eminentia articularis; behind, by the vaginal process ; and, externally, by the auditory process and middle root of the zygoma; and is divided into two parts by a narrow slit, the Glaserian fissure. The anterior part, formed by the squamous portion of the bone, is smooth, covered in the recent state with cartilage, and articulates with the condyle of the lower jaw. This part of the glenoid fossa is separated from the auditory process by a small tubercle, the post-glenoid process, the representative of a prominent tubercle which, in some of the mammalia, descends behind the condyle of the jaw, and prevents it being displaced backwards during mastication (Humphry). The posterior part of the glenoid fossa is formed chiefly by the vaginal process of the petrous portion, and lodges part of the parotid gland. The Glaserian fissure, which leads into the tympanum, lodges the processus gracilis of the malleus, and transmits the Laxator tympani muscle and the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery. The chorda tympani nerve passes through a separate canal, parallel to the Glaserian fissure (canal of Huguier), on the outer side of the Eustachian tube, in the retiring angle between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone.* The i7iternal surface of the squamous portion (fig. 3O is concave, presents numerous eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the cerebrum, and two well-marked grooves for the branches of the middle meningeal artery. Borders The superior border is thin, bevelled at the expense of the internal surface, so as to overiap the lower border of the parietal bone, formmg the squamous suture. The anterior inferior border is thick, serrated, and bevelled, alternately at the expense of the inner and outer surfaces, for articulation with the great wing of the sphenoid. . The Mastoid Portion (tiaaroQ, a nipple or teat) is situated at the posterior part of the bone ; its outer surface is rough, and perforated by numerous foranuna : one of these, of large size, situated at the posterior border of the bone, is termed the mastoid foramen; it transmits a vein to the lateral sinus and a small artery. The position and size of this foramen are very variable.

The Petrous Portimi (irtVpoe, a stone), so named from its extreme density and hardness, is a pyramidal process of bone, wedged in at the base of the skull between the sphenoid and occipital bones. Its direction from without is inwards, forwards, and a little downwards. It presents for examination a base, an apex, three sur- faces, and three borders ; and contains, in its interior, the essential parts of the organ of hearing. The base is applied against the internal surface of the squamous and mastoid portions, its upper half being concealed ; but its lower half is exposed by the divergence of those two portions of the bone which brings into view the oval expanded orifice of a canal leading into the tympanum, the meatus auditoriusTHE SKELETON. 32 externus. This canal is situated botweon tlio mastoid process and tlio posterior and middle roots of tlie zygoma ; its upper margin is smooth and rounded, but the greater part of its circumference is surrounded by a curved plate of bone, the audi- tory process, the free margin of which is thick and rough, for the attachment of the cartilage of the external ear. The apex of the petrous portion, rough and uneven, is received into the angular interval between the posterior border of the great wing of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital; it presents the anterior or internal orifice of the carotid canal, and forms the posterior and external boundary of the foramen lacerum medium. The anterior stir/ace of the petrous portion Cfig. 31) forms tbe posterior part of the middle fossa of the skull.

A projecting eminence of bono occasionally stands out from the centre of the notch, and divides the foramen into two parts. The anterior border is divided into two parts—an outer joined to the squamous portion by a suture, the remains of which are'distinct; an inner, free, articulating with the spinous process of the sphenoid. At the angle of junction of the petrous and squamous portions are seen two canals, separated from one another by a tbui plate of bone, the processus cochlcariformis : they both lead into the tympunum, the upper one transmitting the Teneor tympani muscle, the lower one the Eustachian tube.

The petrous and mastoid portions then become ossified, and lastly the styloid process, which re- mains separate a considerable period, and is occasionally never united to the V*"" StyJoiiprcc rest of the bone.

A narrow transverse groove, the optic groove, bounds the above-mentioned surface behind ; it lodges the optic commissure, and terminates on either side in the optic foramen, for the passage of the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. Behind the optic groove is a small eminence, olive-like in shape, the olivary process; and still more posteriorly, a deep depression, the pituitary fossa, or 'sella Turcica, which lodges the pituitary body This fossa is perforated by numerous foramina, for the transmission of 34.—Sphenoid Bone. Superior Surface. nutrient vessels to the substance of the bone. It is bounded in front by two small eminences, one on either side, called the middle clinoid processes (k-X/cjj, a led), and behind by a square-shaped plate of bone, terminating at each superior angle in a tubercle, the posterior clinoid processes, the size and form of which vary considerably in different individuals. These processes deepen the pituitary fossa ; and serve for the attachment of prolongations from the tentorium cerebelli. The sides of the plate of bone supporting the posterior clinoid processes are notched for the passage of the sixth pair of nerves ; and behind, this plate of bone pre- sents a shallow depression, which slopes obliquely backwards, and is continuous with the basilar groove of the occipital bone ; it supports the upper part of the Pons Varolii. On either side of the body is a broad groove, curved something like the italic letter/; it lodges the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, and is called the cavernous groove. The posterior surface,- quadrilateral in form, articulates with the basilar process of the occipital bone. During childhood these bones are separated by a layer of cartilage; but in after-life (between the eighteenth and twenty-fifth years) this becomes ossified, ossification commencing above, and extending downward: and the two bones then form one piece. The a,nterror surface (fig. 35) presents, in the middle line, a vertical lamella of bono which articulates in front with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, forming part of the septum of the nose. On either side of it are the irregular openings leading into the sphenoid cells or sinuses. These are two large irregular cavities, hollowed o|<yif the interior of the body of the sphenoid bone, and separated from one anotlioi^jy a more or less complete perpendicular bony septum. Their form and size vary considerably; they are seldom symmetrical, and are often partially subdivided by i> 236 THE SKETiETON. irregular OBseoua laminro. Occasionally, tliey extend into the basilar process of the occipital nearly as far as the foramen magnum. The septum is seldom quite vertical, being conunonly bent to one or the other side. These smuses do nob exist in children, but they increase in size as age advances. They are partially closed, in front and below, by two thin curved plates of bone; the sphenoidal turbinated bones, leaving a round opening at their upper parts, by which they communicate with the upper and back part of the nose, and occasionally with the posterior ethmoidal cells or sinuses. The lateral margins of this surface present a serrated edge, which articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid, completing the posterior ethmoidal cells; the lower margin, also rough and serrated, articu- lates with the orbital process of the palate bone ; and the upper margin with the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The inferior surface presents, in the middle hne, a triangular spine, the rostrum, which is continuous with the vertical plate on the anterior surface, and is received into a deep fissure between the ala; of the vomer. On each side may be seen a projecting lamina of bone, which runs horizontally inwards from near the base of the pterygoid process: these plates, termed the vao-inal processes, articulate with the edges of the vomer. Close to the root ot the pterygoid process is a groove, formed into a complete canal when articulated with the sphenoidal process of the palate bone ; it is called the pterygo-palatme canal, and transmits the pterygo-palatine vessels and pharyngeal nerve. The Greater Wings are two strong processes of bone, which arise from the sides ot the body, and arc curved in a direction upwards, outwards, and backwards; being proloncre'd behind into a sharp-pointed extremity, the spi«07*s process of the sphenoid Each wine presents three surfaces and a circumference. The sui^erun-ov ccreOrai surface (fig 34) forms part of the middle fossa of the skull; it is /^^P^' cavc, and presents eminences and depressions for the convolutions ot the Drain. At its anterior and internal part is seen a circular aperture, the foramen rotundum, for the transmission of the second division of the fifth nerve. Behind and ex- ternal to this is a largo oval foramen, the foramen ovale, for the tmnsmission o the third division of tlic fifth nerve, the small meningeal artery and the sman petrosal nerve. At the inner side of the foramen ovale, a small aperture may occasionally be seen opposite the root of the pterygoid process; it is the foramen • In this figure, both tlm anterior and inforior .snrfaoos of the body of the sphenoid bone are^liown, the bone being held with llie pterygoid processes nlmost horizontal.SPHENOID BONE. 37 11 T,.iqf,lv ill tlio ai)cx of the Bpine of the sphenoid Vesalii, tvansmxtting a smaU ve. tLsmifcs the xmddle is a short canal, sometuues ^^^^f^^'.^^^^^^^t ' ^fs convex and divided by a trans- meniugeal artery.

The md.rior or orbdcd surface, smooth and quad- rdate a° in form, assists in forming the outer wall of the orbit. It is bounded above iy a s;rrated edge, for articulation with the frontal bone ; below, by a roanded border which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxiUary fissure ; internally, it enters into the formation of the sphenoidal fissure ; wliile e.xtenially it presents a serrated margin, for articulation with the malar bone. At the upper part of the inner border is a notcb for the transmission of a bi-anoh of the ophthalmic artery 'and at its lower part a small pointed spine of bone, which serves for tlie attachment of part of the lower head of the External rectus. One or two small foramina may occasionally be seen for the passage of branches of the deep temporal arteries; they are called the external orbital foramina. Circumference of the great wiiig (fig.34) : commencing from behind, from the body of the sphenoid to the spine, the outer half of this margin is serrated, for articulation with the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; whilst the inner half forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum medium, and presents the posterior aperture of the Vidian canal. In front of the spine the circumference of the great wing presents a serrated edge, bevelled at the expense of the inner table below, and of the external above, which articulates with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. At the tip of the great wing a triangular portion is seen, bevelled at the expense of the internal surface, for articu- lation with the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. Internal to this is a broad serrated surface, for articulation with the frontal bone : this surface is continuous internally with the sharp inner edge of the orbital plate, which assists in the forma- tion of the sphenoidal fissure. The Lesser Wings (processes of Ingrassias) (fig. 34) are two thin triangular plates of bone, which arise from the upper and lateral parts of the body of the sphenoid; and, projecting transversely outwards, terminate in a sharp point. The superior surface of each is smooth, flat, broader internally than externally, and supports the anterior lobe of the brain. The inferior surface forms the back x>art of the roof of the orbit, and the upper boundary of tlie sphenoidal fissure or foramen lacerum antcrius. This fissui'C is of a triangular form, and leads from the cavity of the cranium into the orbit; it is bounded internally by the body of the sphenoid—above, by the lesser wing ; below, by the internal margin of the orbital surface of the great wing—and is converted into a foramen by the articulation of this bono with the frontal. It transmits the thii'd, the fourth, tlie ophthalmic division of the fifth and sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. The anterior border of the lesser wing is serrated for articulation with the frontal bone; the posterior, smooth and rounded, is received into the fissure of Sylvius of the brain. The inner extremity of this border forms the anterior clinoid process. The lesser wing is connected to the side of the body by two roots, the upper thin and flat, the lower thicker, obliquely directed, and presenting on its outer side, near its junction with the body, a small tubercle, for the attachment of the common tendon of throe of the muscles of the eye. IJetwoen the two roots is the optic foramen, for the transmission of the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery.THE SKELETON. 38 The Pteriigoid processes (nrefwl, a loiwj ; tih,<:, Ukmess), (fig. 36), one on each side, descend perpendicularly fmni the point where the body and great wmg unite. Each process consists of an external and an internal plate, sepa- rated behind by an inter- vening notch,—the pterygoid 36.—Sphenoid Bone. Posterior Surface, fossa; but joined partially in front. The cxlernal pterygoid plate is broad and thin, turned- a little outwards, and forms part of the inner wall of the zygomatic fossa. It gives at- tachment, by its «uter sur- face, to the External ptery- goid ; its inner surface forms part of the pterygoid fossa, iand gives attachment to the Internal pterygoid. The in. ternal pterygoid plate is muph narrower and longer, curving outwijurds, at its extremity, into a hook-like process of m 1 bone the hamular process, around which turns the tendon of the Tensor palati muscle At the b*se of this plate is a small, oval, shallow depression, the scaphoid fossa from which arises the Tensor palati, and above which is seen the posterior orifice of the Vidian canal. The outer surface of this plate forms part ot the pterygoid fossa, the inner surface forming the outer boundary of t^e posterior aperture of the nares. The Superior Constrictor of the phai^nx is attached to ite posterior edge. The two pterygoid plates are separated below ^7 interval, in which the pterygoid process, or tuberosity, of the P-^^t^J^^^;^^^ received.

Development. The sphenoid bone is developed by ten centres, six for the pos- terior sphenoidal division, and four for the anterior sphenoid. The six centres for the posterior sphenoid are—one for each greater wing and external pterygoid plate; one for each internal pterygoid plate ; two for the posterior part of the body.

Each lesser wine is formed by a separate centre, which appears on the outer side of the ^ptic foramen, at^about'the third -o-^h ; they become united and join w h the body at ab^ut the eighth month of fcatal life. At about tlie end of the third year, ossification has made its appearance in the sphenoidal spongy bones. At birth the sphenoid consists of three pieces : viz. the greater wmg and ptery- goid processes on each side ; the lesser wings and body united. At the first year after bii-th, the greater wings and body are united. From the tenth to the twelfth year the spongy bones are partially united to the sphenoid, their junction being complete by the twentieth year. Lastly, the sphenoid joins the occipital. Articidations. The sphenoid articulates with all the bones of the cranium, and five of the face; the two malar, two palate, and vomer : the exact extent of arti- culation with each bone is shown in the accompanying figures.

Outer Surface of Right Lateral Mass (enlarged). of these cavities. It consists of three parts: a horizontal plate, which forms part of the base of the cranium ; a per- pendicular plate, which forms part of the septum nasi; and two lateral masses of cells. The Horizontal or Grihri' form Plate (fig. 38) forms part of the anterior fossa of the base of the skull, and is re- ceived into the ethmoid notch of the frontal bone between the two orbital plates. Pro- jecting upwards from the middle line of this plate, is a thick, smooth, triangular pro- cess of bone, the cristi galli, so called from its resemblance to a cock's comb. Its base joins the cribriform plate. Its posterior border, long, thin, and slightly curved, serves for the attachment of the falx cerebri. Its anterior border, short and thick, articulates with the frontal bone, and presents two small projecting alse, which swo received into corresponding depressions in tho frontal, completing the foramen coecum behind. Its sides are smooth, and sometimes bulging; in which case it is found to enclose a small sinus. On each side of tho crista galli, the cribriform plate is narrow, and deeply grooved, to support the bulb of the ufifA inf.^iur'binutedTHE SKELETON". 4° olfactory nerve, and perforated by foramina for the passage of its filaments. These foramina are arranged in three rows ; the innermost, which are the largest and least nnraerous, are lost in grooves on the upper part of the septum ; the foramina of the outer row are continued on to tho surface of the upper spongy bone, ihe foramina of the middle row are the smaUost; they perforate the bone, and transmit nerves to tho roof of the nose. At the front part of the cribriform plate, on each side of the crista galli, is a small fissure, which transmits the nasal branch ot the ophthalmic nerve; and at its posterior part a triangular notch, whicli receives the ethmoidal spine of the «i.hpiinirl •^q —Perpendicular Plate of Ethmoid (enlarged).

The Ferpeuchcular >^ ° Plate (fig. 39) is a thin flattened lamella of bone, which descends from the under surface of the cribriform plate, and assists in forming the septum of the nose, it is much thinner in the middle than at the circumference, and is generally deflected a little to one side. Its anterior border aj-ti-cu- lates with the frontal spine and crest of the nasal bones. Its pos- terior divided into two •-, ^ ^ parts is connected by itc upper half wtth t%e rostrum of the sphenoid-by its lower half with the vomer. The inferior border serves for the attachment of the tn- ano-ular cartilage of the nose. On each side of the perpendicular plate numerous grooves and canals are seen, leading from foramina on the cribriform plate ; they lodge filaments of the olfactory nerves. n j „„ii„l«r The Lateral Masses of the ethmoid consist of a .number of thin-walled cellular cavities, the ethmoidal cells, interposed between two vertical plates of bone the outer one of which forms part of the orbit, and the Inner one part of the nasal fossa of the corresponding side.

The back part of this surface is subdivided by a narrow oblique fissure, the superior meatus of the nose, bounded above by a thin curved plate of bone—the sjiperio.r turbinated bone. By means of an orifice at the upper part of this fissure, the posterior ethmoidal cells open into the nose. Below, and in front of the superior meatus is seen the convex surface of the middle turbinated bone. It extends along the whole length of the inner surface of each lateral mass ; its lower margin is ree and thick, and its concavity, directed outwards, assists in formmg the middle meatus. It is by a large orifice at the upper and front part of the middle meatus, that the anterior ethmoidal cells, and through them the frontal _ sinuses com- municate with the nose, by means of a funnel-shaped canal, the infundibulum. The cellular cavities of each lateral mass, thus walled in by the os planum on the outer side, and by the other bones already mentioned, are divided by a thm transverse bony partition into two sets, which do not communicate with each other; they are termed the anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells, or sinuses. The former, more numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses above, and the middle meatus below, by means of a long flexuous cellular canal, the inftuHlibulum; the posterior, less nnmerous,_ open into the superior meatus, and communicate (occasionally) with the sphenoidal sinuses, Bevelopment. By three centres : one for the perpendicular lamella, and one for each lateral mass. The lateral masses are first developed, ossific granules making their first appearance in the os planum between the fourth and fifth months of foetal life, and afterwards iu the spongy bones. At birth, the bone consists of the two lateral masses, which are small and ill-developed ; but when the perpendicular and horizontal plates begin to ossify, as they do about the first year after birth, the lateral masses become joined to the cribriform plate. The formation and increase in the ethmoidal cells, which complete the bone, take place about the fifth or sixth year. Articulations.

Development op the Chanium. The development of the r-rnnium commences at a very early pel'iotl, on accoinit of tlio importance of tjie orfran it is intended to protect. In its most rudimentary state, it con- sists of a thin niembrnnous capsule, cnclDsnig the cerebrum, and accurately "moulded upon Its surface. This capsule is placed external to the dura mater, and in close cOnfatct with it; Its walls lire continuous with the canal for the spinal cord, and the chorda dorsnlis, of primitive purt of the vet<!l)rnl colunni, is continued forwards, from the spine, along the bas(', to Its fore part, wliere it terminalps in a tapering point. The next stop in tlie process of development is the formation of cartilage. This is deposited in the base of the skull,43 THE SKELETON. 41.—Skull at Birth, showing the Anterior and Posterior Fontaaelles. iu two syniniotrical segments, one on either side of the median line; these subsequently coalesce, so as to enclose tlie chorda dorsalis—the chief part of the cerebral capsule still retaininf its membranous form. Ossilicution first takes placie in the roof, and is preceded bv the deposition of a membranous blastema upon the surface of the cerebral capsule, in which the ossifying process extends; the primitive membranous capsule becoming the internal periosteum, and being ultimately blended with the dura mater. Although the bones of the vertex of the skull appear before tbose at the base, and make con- siderable progress in their growth: at birth ossification is more advanced in the base, this portion of the skull forming a solid immov- able groundwork. The B'ontanellbs (figs. 41, 42). Before birth, the bones at the vertex and side of the skull are separated from each other by membranous intervals, in which bone is deficient. These intervals, at certain parts, are of considerable size, and are termed the fon- tanellen, so called from the pulsations of the brain, which are perceptible at the anterior fontanelle, and were likened to the rising of water in a fountain. The fontanelles are four iu number, and correspond to the junction of the four angles of the parietal with the con- tiguous bones. The anterior fontanelle is th'e largest, and corresponds to the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures; the pos- terior fontanelle, of smaller size, is situated at the junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures ; the two remaining ones are situated at the inferior angles of the parietal bone. The latter are closed soon after birth; the two at the superior angles remain open longer: the posterior being closed in a few months after birth; the anterior remaining open imtil tbe first or second year. These spaces are gradually filled in by an extension of the ossifying process, or by the development ot a Wormian bone. Sometimes the anterior fontanelle remains open beyond two years, and is occasionally persistent throughout lite. 42.—The Lateral Fontanelles. SUPBRJSDMERARY OE WoRMU^^ * BONES.

The Facial Bones are fourteen in number, viz., the Two Nasal, Two Palate, Two Superior Maxillary, Two Inferior Turbinated, Two Lachrymal, Vomer, Two Malar, - Inferior Maxillary. Nasal Bones. The Nasal are two small oblong bones, varying in size and form in different individuals ; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face, forming, by their junction, ' the bridge' of the nose. Each bone presents for examination two surfaces, and four bor- ders. The outer surface is concave from above downwards, convex from side to side ; it is covered by the Py- ramidalis and Com- pressor nasi muscles, marked by numerous small arterial furrows, and perforated about its centre by a foramen, Xitner Surfime sometimes double, for the transmission of a small vein. Sometimes this foramen is absent on one or both sides, and occasionally the foramen coecum opens on this surface.

SuPEKiOB Maxillaey Bones, The Superior Maxillary is one of the most iaiportant bones of the face in a surgical point of view, on account of the number of diseases to which some of its parts are liable. Its minute examination becomes, therefore, a matter of considerable interest It is the largest bone of the face, excepting the lower'jaw ; and forms, by its union with its fellow of the opposite side, the whole of the upper jaw. Each bone assists in the formation of three cayities, the roof of the mouth, the floor and outer wall of the nose, and the floor of the orbit; and also enters mto the formation of two fossie, the zygomatic and spheno-maxiUary; and two hssures, the spheno-maxiUary and pterygo-maxillary. The bone presents for examination a body and four processes, malar, nasal, alveolar, and palatine. . . . . ■ ^ n i The body is somewhat cuboid, and is hollowed out m its interior to form alaige cavity, the antrum of Highmore. Its surfaces are foui-an external or facial, a posterior or zygomatic, a superior or orbital, and an internal ^ ^ , ^ The external or facial surface (fig. 45) i« directed forwards and outwards. In the median line of the bone, just above the incisor teeth, is a depression, the in cisive or myrtiform fossa, which gives origin to the Depressor ate nasi.

Along the middle line of the orbital surface is a deep groove, the infra-orbital, for the passage of the infra-orbital nerve and artery. This groove commences at the middle of the outer border of the surface, and, passing forwards, terminates in a canal which subdivides into two branches ; one of the canals, the infra-orbital, opens just below the margin of the orbit; the other, which is smaller, runs into the substance of the anterior wall of the antrum ; it is called the anterior dental canal, transmitting the anterior dental vessels and nerves to the front teeth of the upper jaw. At the inner and fore part of the orbital surface, just external to the lachrymal canal, is a minute depressiony whicb gives origin to the Inferior oblique muscle of the eye. The internal surface (fig. 46) is unequally divided into two parts by a horizontal projection of bone, the palate process ; the portion above the palate process forms part of the outer wall of the nose ; that below it forms part of the cavity of the mouth. The superior division of this surface presents a largo irregular opening leading into the antrum of Highmore, At the upper border of this apertuiv are numerous brolcon cellular cavities, which, in the articulated skull, are closed in by the ethmoid and lachrymal bones. Below the aperture is a smooth concavity which foiTTis part of the inferior meatus of the nose, traver.sed by a fissure, the maxillary fissure, which runs from the lower part of the orifice of the antrum obliquely downwards and forwards, and iTCcives the maxillary pfocess of the palate bone.

It is from the extreme ihmness of the walls of this cavity, that we are enabled to explain how a tumour, growmg fx-om the antrum, encroaches upon the adjacent partB, puslnng up the floor of the orbit, and displacing the eyeball, projecting inward into the nose, protrudmg forwards on to the cheek, and making its way backwards into tlie zygomatic fossa, and downwards into the mouth. •, , j . .1 i r „ The Malar Process is a rough triangular emmence, situated at the angle of sepa. ration of the facial from the zygomatic surface. In front it is concave forming part of the facial surface ; behind, it is also concave, and forms part of the zygomatic fossa- above, it is rough and serrated for articulation with the malar bone ; whilst below, a prominent ridge marks the division between the facial and zygomatic sur- faces. A small part of the Masseter muscle arises from this process. The Nasal Process is a thick triangular plate of bone, which projects upwards inwards, and backwards, by the side of the nose, forming part of its lateral boundary. Its external surface is concave, smooth, perforated by numerous fora- mina, and gives attachment to the Levator laHi superioris alseque nasi, the Orbicularis '5)alpebrarum, and Tendo oculi. Its internal surface forms part of the outer wall of the nose ; it articulates above with the frontal, and presents a rough' uneven surface, which articulates with the ethmoid bone, closing in the anterior ethmoidal cells ; below this is a transverse ridge, the superior turbinated crest, for articulation with the middle turbinated bone of the ethmoid, bounded below by a smooth concavity which forms part of the middle meatus ; below this again is the inferior turbinated crest (already described), for articulation with the inferior tur- binated bone ; and still more inferiorly, the concavity which forms part of tho inferior meatus. The anterior border of the nasal process is thin, directed obliquely downwards and forwards, and presents a serrated edge for articulation with the nasal bone : its posterior border is thick, and hollowed into a groove for the lachrymal duct: of the two margins of this groove, the inner one articulates with the lachrymal bone, the outer one forms part of the circumference of the orbit. Just where the latter joins the orbital surface is a small tubercle, the lachrymal tubercle; this serves as a guide to the surgeon in the performance of the operation for fistula lachrymalis. The lachrymal groove in the articulated skull is converted into a canal by the lachrymal bone, and lachrymal process of the inferior turbinated ; it is directed downwards, and a little backwards and outwards, is about the diameter of a goose-quill, slightly narrower in the middle than at either extremity, and lodges the lachrymal duct. The Alveolar Process is the thickest and most spongy part of the bone, broader behind than in front, and excavated into deep cavities for the reception of the teeth. These cavities are eight in number, and vary in size and depth according to the teeth they contain. That for the canine tooth is the deepest; those for the molars are the widest, and subdivided into minor cavities ; those for the incisors are single, but deep and narrow. The Buccinator muscle arises from the outer'surface of this process, as far forward as the first molar tooth. The Palate Process, thick and strong, projects horizontally inwards from tho inner surface of the bone. It is much thicker in front than behind, and forms a considerable part of the floor of the nostril, and the roof of the month. Its upper surface is concave from side to side, smooth and forms part of the floor of the nose. In front is seen the upper orifice of the anterior palatine (incisor) canal, which leads into a fossa formed by the junction of the two superior maxillary bones, and situated immediately behind the incisor teeth. It transmits the anterior palatine vessels, the naso-palatine nerves passing through the intermaxillary suture. The inferior surface, also concave, is rough and uneven, and forms part of the roof of the mouth. This surface is perforated by numerous foramina for the passage of nutritious vessels, channelled at the back part of its alveolar border by a longitudinal groove, sometimes a canal, for the transmission of tho posterior palatine vessels, and a large nerve, and presents little depressions for the lodgment of the palatine glands. This surface presents anteriorly the lower onTice of theTHE SKETiETON. 48 anterior palatine fossa. In some bones, a delicate linear suture may be seen ex- teudincr from the anterior palatine fossa to the interval betsveeu the lateral mcisor and the canine tooth. This marks out the intermaxillary, or incisive bone, winch in some animals exists permanently as a separate piece It includes the whole thickness of the alveolus, the corresponding part of the floor of the nose and the anterior nasal spine, and contains the sockets of the incxsor teeth, rhe outer border of the palate process is incorporated w.th the rest of the bone. The innei border is thicker in fi-ont than behind, and is x-aised above mto a ridge, which, with the corresponding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a groove ^he receptK.n of the vomer. The anterior margin is bounded by the thin concave bordei of the opening of the nose, prolmiged forwards internally mto a sharp process, forming, with a similar process of the • nr -u n opposite bone, Janterio,- nasal *7-^"'^^^} tfSXl^^'""' " spine.

This bono is formed at sueh an early period, and ossilicatioQ proceeds in it with such rapidity, that it has- been found impracticable hitherto to determine with accuracy its number of centres. It appears, however,, pi'obable that it has four centres of developoient, viz., one for the nasal and facial por- tions, one for the orbital and malar, one for the incisive, and one for the palatal portion, in- cluding the entire palate except the incisive segment.

The portion of bone behind the ridge is smooth, Xh ly concave, and forms part of the inner wall of the orbit The ridge, with a ^art of the orbital surface immediately behind it, affords attachment to the Tensor Lsi: the ridge terminates below in a small hook-like process, which articulates with the lachrymal tubercle of the superior maxillary bone and completes the upper orifice of the lachrymal canal. It sometimes exists as a separate piece, which is then called the lesser lachrymal hone. The in- ternal or nasal surface presents a depressed furrow, corresponding to the ridge on its outer surface. The surface of bone in front of this forms part of the middle meatus; and that behind it articulates with the ethmoid bone, filKng in the anterior ethmoidal cells. Of the four lorders, the anterior is the longest, and articulates witb the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. The posterior, thin and uneven, articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid The superior, the shortest and thickest, articulates ■with the internal angular process of the frontal hone. The inferior is divided by the lower edge of the vertical crest into two parts: the posterior part articulates with the orbital plate of the superior maxillary bone ; the anterior portion is prolonged downwards into a pointed process, which articulates with the lachrymal process of the mferior turbinated bone, and assists in the formation of the lachrymal canal.

The Malar are two small quadrangular bones, situated at the upper and outer part of the face: they form the prominence of the cheek, part of the outer wall and floor of the orbit, and part of the temporal and zygomatic fossae. Bach bone presents for examination an external and an internal surface; four processes, the frontal, orbital, maxillaiy, and zygomatic; and four borders. The external surface (fig. 49) is smooth, convex, perforated near its centre by one or two small apertures, the malar foramina, for the passage of nerves and vessels, covered by the Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, and affords attachment to the Zygomaticus major and minor muscles. The internal surface (fig. 50), directed backwards and towards, is concave, pi"C- senting internally a roagh triangular surface, for articulation with the superior maxillary bone; and esteaTially, a smooth concave surface, which forms the anterior boundary of the temporal fossa above ; and below, where it is wider, forms part of the zygomatic fossa. This surface presents, a little above its centre, the aperture of one or two malar canals, and affords attachment to part of two muscles, the Temporal above, and the Massetor bolow. Of the four processes, the frontal is thick and serrated, and articulates with the external angular procosa EBriad^ii pastxiH throtujh T'emporoHalaT Citnuls 50 THE SKELETON. of the frontal bone.

Its posterior margin is rough and serrated for articulation with 49—Left Malar Bone. Outer Surface, the sphenoid; internally it is also serrated for articulation with the orbital surface of the superior maxillary. At the angle of junction of the sphe- noidal and maxillary portions, a short rounded non-articular margin is generally seen: this forms the anterior boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure ; occasionally, no such non-arti- cular margin exists, the fissure being completed by the direct junction of the maxillary and sphenoid bones, or by the inter- position of a small Wormian bone in the angular interval be- tween them. On the upper sur- face of the orbital process are seen the orifices of one or two temporo-malar canals; one of these usually opens on the pos- terior surface, the other (occa- sionally two), on the facial surface: they transmit filaments (temporo-malar) of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The maxillary process is a rough triangular surface, which articulates with the supe- rior maxillary bone.

Levator labii superioris propnus, Zygomatxcus major and minor, Masseter, and Temporal. The Palate Bones. The Palate Bones are situated at the back part of the nasal foss^ ; they are wedged in between the superior maxillary and the pterygoid Process of the sphenoid. Each bone assists in the formation of three cavities: the floor and outer wail of the nose, the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the orbit; and enters into the formation of three foss^B: the zygomatic, spheno-maxillary, and pterygoid ; and one fissm-e, the spheno-maxQlary. In form the palate bone somewhat resem- bles the letter L, and may be divided into an inferior or horizontal plate, and a superior or vertical plate. The Emizontal Plate is thick, of a quadrilateral form, and presents two surfaces and four borders. The superior surface, concave from side to side, forms the back part of the floor of the nostril. The inferior surface, slightly concave and rough, forms the back part of the hard palate. At its posterior' part may be seen a transverse ridge, more or less marked, for the attachment of the aponeurosis of the Tensor palati muscle. At the outer extremity of this ridge is a deep groove con- verted into a canal by its articulation with the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and forming the posterior palatine canal. Near this groove, the orifices of one or two small canals, accessory posterior palatine, may frequently be seen. The anterior border is serrated, bevelled at the expense of its inferior surface, and articulates with the palate process of the superior maxillary bone. The posterior border is concave, free, and serves for the attachment of the soft palate. Its inner extremity is sharp and pointed, and, when united with the opposite bone, forms a projecting process, the posterior nasal spine, for the attachment of the Azygos uvuliB. The external border is united with the lower part of the perpen- dicular plate almost at right angles. The internal border, the thickest, is seii-ated for articulation with its fellow of the opposite side ; its superior edge is raised into a ridge, which, united with the opposite bone, forms a crest in which the vomer is received. The Vertical Plate (fig. 51) is thin, of an oblong 51.—Left Palate Bone. Internal View (enlarged). ,iial P, form, and directed upwards a.nd a little in- wards. It presents two surfaces, an external and an internal, and four bor- ders. The internal surface pre- sents at its lower part a broad shallow depression, which forms part of the inferior meatus of the nose. Immediately above this is a well-marked horizontal ridge, the inferior turbi- nated crest, for articulation with the inferior turbinated bone ; above this, a second broad shallow depression, which forms part of the middle meatus, surmount- ed above by a horizontal ridge less prominent than the inferior, the superior turbinated crest, for articulation with the middle turbinated bone. Above the AfajciSitri:! jPtoccis HORIZONTAL TLATC52 THE SKELETON. superior turbinated crest is a narrow horizontal groove, wbich forms part of the superior meatus. i p The external surface is rough and irregular throughout the greater part ot its extent, for articulation with the inner surface of the superior maxillary bone, its upper and back part being smooth where it enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fossa; it is also smooth in front, where it covers the onfice of the antrum. Towards the back part of this surface is a deep groove, converted into a canal, the posterior palatine, by its articulation with the superior maxillary bone. It transmits the posterior, or descending palatine vesse s, and a large nerve The anterior border is thin, irregular, and presents opposite the inferior turbinated crest a pointed projecting lamina, the maxillary process which is directed forwards and closes in the lower and back part of the opening of the antrum, being received into a fissure that exists at the inferior part of this aperture. The posterior border Cfiff qo) presents a deep groove, the edges of which are serrated for articulation wifh the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. At the low^ part of thisJ^order is seen a pvramidal process of bone, the pterygoid process or tuberosity of the palate which is received into the angular interval between the two pterygoid plates of the sphenoid at their "inferior extremity. This process presents at its b^k part three grooves, a median and two lateral ones. The former is smooth, and forms part of the pterygoid fossa, affording attachment to the Internal pterygoid muscle; whilst the lateral grooves are rough and uneven, for articulation with the anterior border of each pterygoid plate. A few fibres of the External pterygoid muscle also arise from the tuberosity of the palate bone. The base of this process continuous with the horizontal portion of the bone, presents the apertures of the accesso^ descending palatine canals ; whilst its outer surface is rough for articulation with the inner surface of the body of the superior maxillary bone. . , The superior border of the vertical plate presents two well-marked processes separated by an intervening notch or foramen. The anterior, or larger, is called the orbital process; the ^OBi^riov,ihe sphenoidal. _ nr. a hiVher The OM Process, directed upwards and outwards is p aced on a higher level than the sphenoidal.

It ordinarily presents a small open cell, which communicates with the sphenoidal sinus, and the margins of which are ser- rated for articulation with the vertical part of the sphenoidal turbinated bone. The internal or ethmoidal surface is directed inwards, upwards, and forwards, and articulates with the lateral mass of the ethmoid bone. In some cases, the cellular cavity above-mentioned opens on this surface of the bone; it then communicates with the posterior ethmoidal cells.

From a single centre, which makes its appearance at the angle of junction of the two plates of the bone. From this point ossification spreads^ in- wards to the horizontal plate, downwards into the tuberosity, and upwards into the vertical plate. In the foetus, the horizontal plate is much longer than the vertical; and even after it is fully ossified, the whole bone is at first remarkable for its shortness. - . . Articulations. With six bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, in- ferior turbinated, vomer, ai?^d opposite palate. Attachment of Muscles. The Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae, Intern?,! and External pterygoid, and Superior constrictor of the pharynx. The Inferior Tdrbtnated Bojtbs, The Inferior Turhinated Bones are situated one on each side of the outer wall of the nasal fossse. Each consists of a layer of thin spongy bone, curled upon itself like a scroll, hence its uarno ' turbinated ;' and extends horizontally along the outer wall of the nasal fossa, immediately below the orifice of the antrum. Each bone presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The internal surface (fig. 53) is convex, perforated by numerous apertures, and traversed by longitudinal grooves and canals for the lodgment of arfcferies and veins. In the recent state it is covered by the lining membrane of the nose. The external surface is concave (fig. 54), and forms part of the inferior meatus. Its upper border is thin, iiTegular, and connected to various bones along the outer wall of the nose. It may be divided into three portions ; of these, the anterior articulates with the inferior turbinated crest of the superior maxillary bone; the posterior with the inferior turbinated crest of the palate bone; the middle portion of the superior border presents three well-marked processes, which vary much in their size and form. Of these the anterior and smallest is situated at the junction of the anterior fourth with the posterior three-fourths of the bono; it is small and pointed, and is called the lachrymal process, for it articulates withTHE SKELETON. 54 53.—Right Inferior Turbinated Bone.

At the junction of the two middle fourths of the bone, but encroaching on its posterior fourth, a broad thin plate, the ethnwidal process, ascends to join the unciform process of the ethmoid: from the lower border of this process a thin lamina of bone curves downwards and outwards, hooking over the lower edge of the orifice of the antrum, which it narrows below: it is called the maxillary process, and fixes the bone firmly on to . the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The inferior border is free, thick and cellular in structure, more especially in the middle of the , • , j jc ^-u v.«„« bone Both extremities are more or less narrow and pointed If the bone is held so that its outer concave surface is directed backwards (i.e. towards the holder), and its superior border, from which the lachrymal and ethmoidal processes project, upwards, the lachrymal process will be directed to the side to which the bone belongs. Development. By a single centre, which makes its appearance about the middle of foetal life. Articulations. With four bones : one of the cranium, the ethmoid, and three of the face, the superior maxillary, lachrymal and palate. No muscles are attached to tbis bone. The Vomer. The Vomer is a single bone, situated vertically at the back part of the nasal foss^, forming part of the septum of the nose It is thin, somewhat like a ploughshare in form ; but it varies in different individuals, being frequently bent to one or the other side; it 55.—Vomer, presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The lateral surfaces are smooth, marked by small furrows for the lodgment of blood-vessels, and by a groove on each side, sometimes a canal, the naso-palatine, whicb runs obliquely downwards and forwards to the intermaxillary suture between the two ante- rior palatine canals; it trans- mits the naso-palatine nerve. The superior border, the . . . thickest, presents a deep groove, bounded on each side by a horizontal projectmg ala of bone : the groove receives the rostrum of the sphenoid, whilst the al83 are overlapped and retained by laminro (the vaginal processes) which project from the under surface of the body of the sphenoid at the base of the pterygoid processes. At the front of the groove a fissure is left for the transmission of blood-vessels to the substance of the bone.

It consists of a curved horizonta portion the body, and two perpendicular portions, the rami, which join the back part ot the body nearly at right angles. _ i +r „ „^ri Ihe Eorizontal portion, or body (fig. 56), is convex in its general outline^and curved somewhat Hke a horse-shoe. It presents for examination two surfaces 56.—Inferior Maxillary Bone. Outer Surface. Side View. and two borders. The external surface is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards. In the median line is a vertical ridge, the symphysis, which extends from the upper to the lower border of the bone, and indicates the point of junction of the two pieces of which the bone is composed at an early period of life. The lower part of the ridge terminates in a prominent triangular eminence the mental process. On cither side of the symphysis, just below the roots of the incisor teeth, is a depression, the incisive fossa, for the attachment of the Levator menti (or Levator labii inferioris) ; and still more externally, a foramen, tho56 THE SKELETON. mental foramen, for the passage of the mental nerve and artery. This foramen is placed just below the root of the second bicuspid tooth. Running outwards from the base of the mental process on each side, is a well-marked ridge, the extei-nal oblique line. The ridge is at first nearly horizontal, but afterwards inclines up- wards and backwards, and is continuous with the anterior border of the ramus; it afibrds attachment to the Depressor labii inferioris and Depressor anguli oris, below which the Platysma myoides is inserted. The internal surface (fig. 57) is concave from side to side, convex from above downwards. In the middle line is an indistinct linear depression, corresponding to the symphysis externally ; on either side of this depression, just below its centre, are four prominent tubercles, placed in pairs, two above and two below; they are called the genial tubercles^ and afford attachment, the upper pair to the Genio-hyo- glossi muscles, the lower pair to the Genio-hyoidei muscles. Sometimes the tubercles on each side are blended into one, or they all unite into an irregular eminence of bone, or nothing but an irregularity may be seen on the surface of the bone at this part. On either side of the genial tubercles is an oval depression, the sublingual fossa, for lodging the sublingual gland; and beneath the fossa, a 57.—Inferior Maxillaiy Bone. Inner Surface. Side View. rough depression on each side, which gives attachment to the antei-ior belly of the Digastric muscle. At the back part of the sublingual fossa, the internal obhque line (mylo-hyoidean) commences ; it is at first faintly marked, but becomes more distinct as it passes upwards and outwards, and is especially promment opposite the last two molar teeth ; it affords attachment throughout its whole extent to the JSlylo- hyoid muscle, the Superior constrictor of the pharynx with the pterygo-maxUlary ligament, being attached above its posterior extremity, nearer the alveolar margm. The portion of bone above this ridge is smooth, and covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth ; whilst that below it presents an oblong depression, the submaxillary fossa, wider behind than in front, for the lodgment of the submaxillary gland. The external oblique line and the internal or mylo-hyoidean line divide the body of the bone into a superior or alveolar, and an inferior or basilar portion. The sicperior or alveolar border is wider, and its margins thicker behind thaai m front. It is hollowed into numerous cavities, for the reception of the teeth ; these cavities are sixteen in number, and vary in depth and size accordmg to the teetH which they contain. To its outer side, the Buccinator muscle is attached as tar57 INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. forward as the first molar tootli. The tn/.nor harder is rounded longer than the superior, and thicker in front than behind; it presents a shallow groove, just where the body joins the ramus, over which the facial artery turns The Perveldicular Portions, or Rami, are of a quadnlateral form. Each presen s for^ examination two surfaces, four bonlers, and two processes. The ^ .rface is flat, marked with ridges, and gives attachment throughout , „i,.i„ ,.f i^. ..for^f, fn the Masseter muscle. The internal surface nearly the whole of its extent to the Masseter i r +i presents about its centre the oblique aperture of the inferior dental canal, for the ■pissace of the inferior dental vessels and nerve, The margin of this opening fs irreVlar; it presents in front a prominent ridge, surmounted by a sharp spine ^vhich gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the ower jaw ; and at its lower and back part a notch leading to a groove, the mylo-liyoidean which runs obliquely downwards to the back part of the submaxillary fossa j and lodges the mvlo-hyoid vessels and nerve : behind the groove is a rough surface, for the insertion of the Internal pterygoid muscle. The inferior dental canal runs obliquely downwards and forwards in the substance of the ramus, and then hori- zontally forwards in the body; it is here placed nnder the alveoli, with which it> communicates by small openings. On arriving at the incisor teeth, it turns back to communicate with the mental foramen, giving off" two small canals, which run. forward, to be lost in the cancellous tissue of the bone beneath the incisor teeth. This canal, in the posterior two-thirds of the bone, is situated nearer the internal surface of the jaw ; and in the anterior third, nearer its external surface. Its walls- are composed of compact tissue at either extremity, and of cancellous in the centre. It contains the inferior dental vessels and nerve, from which branches are dis- tributed to the teeth through small apertures at the bases of the alveoli. The upper border of the ramus is thin, and presents two processes, separated by a deep concavity, the sigmoid notch. Of these processes, the anterior is the coronoid^ the posterior the condyloid. The Coronoid Process is a thin, flattened, triangular eminence of bone, which varies in shape and size in diff"erent subjects, and serves chiefly for the attach- ment of the Temporal muscle. Its external- surface is smooth, and aSbrds attachment to the Masseter and Temporal muscles. Its internal surface gives attachment to the Temporal muscle, and presents the commencement of a longitu- dinal ridge, which is continued to the posterior part of the alveolar process. On the outer side of this ridgeis a deep groove, continued below on the outer side of the alveolar process ; this ridge and part of the groove afibrd attachment, above, to the Temporal; below, to the Buccinator muscle. The Condyloid Process, shorter but thicker than the coronoid, consists of two portions: the condyle, and the constricted portion which supports the condyle, the neck. The condyle is of an oblong form, its long axis being transveiree, and set obliquely on the neck in such a manner that its outer end is a little more forward and a little higher than its inner. It is convex from before backwards, and from side to side, the articular surface extending further on the posterior than on the anterior surface. The neck of the condyle is flattened from before backwards, and strengthened by ridges which descend from the fore part and sides of the condyle. Its lateral margins are narrow, and present externally a tubercle for the external lateral ligament. Its posterior surface is convex; its anterior is hollowed out on its inner side by a depression (the pterygoid fossa) for the attach- ment of the External pterygoid. The loioer harder of the ramus is thick, straight, and continuous with the body of the bone. At its juuction with the posterior border is the angle of the jaw, which is either inverted or everted, and marked by rough oblique ridges on each side for the attachment of the Masseter externally, and the Internal pterygoid internally; the stylo-maxillary ligament is attached to the bone between these muscles. The aiiterior harder is thin above, thicker below, and continuous with •the external oblique line. The posterior harder is thick, smooth, rounded, and jcovered by the parotid gland.61,—In old Age.THE SUTURES. 59 The S,V,«o« Nolck, separatrag the two processes, is a deep semitanar depression, "Tell-'Trwrirted"::rnch »„ early peri^J of iife before, indeed, a„/XX;e.ceptthecWc,ethat.^^^^^^^^^ lX:::::.:^o:::l^ZJS,Zll,o segments meeting at the s,.pV strhrtWbeco.e..ited Additiona.^^^^^^^^^ coronoid process, the condyle, the angle, and tne tmn pm the inner side of the alveolus.

J-o lue tis.ife in wh ch one or two osseous nuclei are generally found. The body is a ^^ere shell of bone contdninc. the sockets of the two incisor, the canine, and the two temporary molar teetrimpStiy Partitioned fmm one another. The dental canal is of large size, and runs neaAhe low border of the bone, the mental foramen opening t^^'^^'^th the socket of the first molar. The angle is obtuse, from the jaws not being as yet separated by the pruntion of the teeth. . . i. • „ After birth (fiff. 59), the two segments of the bone become joined at the symphysis, from below upwards, in the first year; but a trace of separation may be visible in the beginning of the second year, near the alveolar margin. The body becomes elongated m its whole len<^th but more especially behind the mental foramen, to provide space for the three addkio'nal teeth developed in this part. The depth of the body becomes greater owing to increased growth of the alveolar part, to afford room for the fangs of the teeth, and by thickenin<? of the subdental portion which enables the jaw to withstand the powerful action of the masticatory muscles; but the alveolar portion is the deeper of the two, and conse- auently the chief part of the body lies above the oblique line. The dental canal, after the second dentition, is situated just above the level of the mylo-hyoid ndge ; and the mental foramen occupies the position usual to it in the adult. The angle becomes less obtuse, owing to the separation of the jaws by the teeth. _ „ , , , 1, r i In the adult (fig. 60), the alveolar and basilar portions of the body are usually of equal depth The mental foramen opens midway between the upper and lower border of the bone, and the dental canal runs nearly parallel with the mylo-hyoid line. The ramus is almost vertical in direction, and joins the body nearly at right angles. . , , , „ , In old age (fig. 61), the bone becomes greatly reduced in size; for, with the loss ot the teeth, the alveolar process is absorbed, and the basilar part of the bone alone re mains; consequently, the chief part of the bone is heloio the oblique line. The dental canal, with the mental foramen opening from it, is close to the alveolar border. The rami are oblique in direction, and the angle obtuse. Articulations.

THE SUTURES, The bones of the cranium and face ai-e connected to each other by means of Sutures. The sutures are rows of dentated processes of bone, projecting from the edge of either bone, and locking into each other: the dentations, however, are confined to the external table, the edges of the internal table lying merely in ap- position. The Cranial Sutures may he divided into three sets: i. Those at the vertex of the skull. 2. Those at the side of the skull. 3. Those at the base. The sutures at the vertex of the skull are three: the sagittal, coronal, and lambdoid. The Sagittal Stdu/re (interparietal) is formed by the junction of the two parietal bones, and extends from the middle of the frontal bone, backwards to the superior.6o THE SKELETON. angle of tbe occipital. In childhood and occasionally in the adult, when the two halves of the frontal bone are not united, it is continued forwards to the root of the nose. This suture sometimes presents, near its posterior extremity, the parietal foramen on each side ; and in front, where it joins the coronal suture, a space is occasionally left, which encloses a large Wormian bone. The Coronal Suture {fronto-'parietal) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, and connects the frontal with the parietal bones. It commences at the extremity of the great wing of the sphenoid on one side, and termmates at the same point on the opposite side. The dentations of this suture are more marked at the sides than at the summit, and are so constructed that the frontal rests on the parietal above, whilst laterally the frontal supports the parietal. The Lamhdoid Suture (occvpito-parietal), so called from its resemblance to the Greek letter A, connects the occipital with the parietal bones. It commences on each side at the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and inclmes upwards to the end of the sagittal suture. The dentations of this suture are very deep and dis- tinct and are often interrupted by several small Wormian bones. The sutures at the side of the skull are also three in numb-.r: the spheno-parietal, squamo-parietal, and masto-parietal. They are subdivisions of a smgle suture formed between the lower border of the parietal, and the temporal and sphenoid bones, and which extends from the lower end of the lambdoid suture behind, to the lower'end of the coronal suture in front. , ,. „ 4. • The Sphenoparietal is very short; it is formed by the tip of the great wmg of the sphenoid, which overlays the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone.

It is probable that they serve the purpose of perm, tmg the growth of the bones at their margins; while tbeir pecuhar formation together w.th the interposition of the sutural ligament between the bones forming them, prevents the dispersion of blows or jars received upon the sku 1. Bj. Humphry remarks, ' that, as a general rale, the'sutures are first obliterated at the parts m wh.ch the ossiaktion of the skull was last completed, viz. m the neighbourhood of the fontanelles; and the cranial bones seem in this respect to observe a similar law to that which regulates the union of the epiphyses to the shafts of the Jong bones. THE SKULL. The Skull, formed by the union of the several cranial and facial bones already described, when considered as a whole, is divisible into five regions : a superior region or vertex, an inferior region or base, two lateral regions, and an anterior region, the face. Veetkx op the Skull. The Superior Region, or Vertex, presents two surfaces, an external and an internal. The External Surface is bounded, in front, by the nasal eminences and super- ciliary ridges ; behind, by the occipital protuberance and superior curved lines of the occipital bone ; laterally, by an imaginary line extending from the outer end of the superior curved line, along the temporal ridge, to the external angular process of the frontal. This surface includes the vertical portion of the frontal, the greater part of the parietal, and the superior third of the occipital bone ; it is smooth, convex, of an elongated oval form, crossed transversely by the coronal suture, and from before backwards by the sagittal, which terminates behind in the lambdoid. From before backwards may be seen the frontal eminences and remains of the sutnre connecting the two lateral halves of the frontal bone; on each side of the sagittal suture is the parietal foramen and parietal eminence, and still more posteriorly the smooth convex surface of the occipital bone. The Internal Surface is concave, presents eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the cerebrum, and numerous farrows for the lodgment of branches of the meningeal arteries. Along the middle line of this sui'face is a longitudinal groove, narrow in front, where it terminates in the frontal'crest; broader behind; it lodges the superior longitudinal sinus, and its margins afibrd attachment to the falx cerebri. On either side of it are several depressions for the Pacchionian bodies, and at its back part, the internal openings of the parietal foramina. This surface is crossed, in front, by the coronal suture ; from before backwards, by the sagittal; behind, by the lambdoid. Basis op the Skitll. The Inferior Region, or Base of the Skull, presents two surfaces, an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar. The Internal or Cerebral Surface (fig. 62), presents three fossae, on each side, called the anterior, middle, and posterior fossee of the cranium. The Anterior Fossa is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, the ethmoidal spine and lesser wing of the sphenoid. It is the most elevated of the three fossa), convex externally where it corresponds to the roof of the orbit, concave in the median line in the situation of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. It is traversed by three sutures, the ethmoido-frontal, ethmo- sphenoidal, and fronto-sphenoidal; and lodges the anterior lobe of the cerebrnm. it presents, in the median line, from before backwards, the commencement of the groove for the superior longitudinal sinus, and the crest for the attachment of the falx62 THE SKELETON. cerebri; the foramen ccecum, an aperture formed by tlie frontal bone and the crista galli of the ethmoid, which, if pervious, transmits a small vein from the nose to the superior longitudinal sinus ; behind the foramen coocum, the crista galli, the posterior margin of which affords attachment to the falx cerebri; on cither side of the crista galli, the olfactory groove, which supports the bulb of the olfactory nerve, and is perforated by three rows of orifices for its filaments, and in front by a sht-hke 62.—Base of the Skull.

On the outer Bide of each olfacto?; groove are the internal openings of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina f the former, situated about the middle of the outer margin of the olfac- tory grooU, transmits the anterior ethmoidal artery and the nasal nerve, which ru/s fn a depression along the surface of the ethmoid, to the s it-like opening above mentioned; whilst the posterior ethmoidal foramen opens at the back part of l^iis margin under cover of the projecting lamina of the sphenoid, and transmits the posterior ethmoidal artery and v.ein to the posterior ethmoidal cells. Further back in the middle Une is the ethmoidal spine, bounded behind by an elevated ridge, sepai-ating a longitudinal groove on each side which supports the olfactory nerve. The anterior fossa presents laterally eminences and depressions for the convo- lutions of the brain, and gi-ooves for the lodgment of the anterior meningeal arteries. The Middle Fossa, somewhat deeper than the preceding, is narrow m the middle, and becomes wider as it expands laterally. It is bounded in front by the posterior margin of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, the anterior clinoid process, and the anterior margin of the optic groove; behind, by the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal, and basilai- suture ; externally, by the squamous portion of the temporal, and anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and is separated from its fellow by the sella Turcica. It is traversed by four sutures, the squamous, spheno-parietal, spheno-temporal, and petro-sphenoidal. In the middle line, from before backwards, is the optic groove, which supports the optic commissure, and terminates on each side in the optic foramen, for the passage of the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery ; behind the optic groove is the olivary process, and laterally the anterior clinoid processes, to which are attached the folds of the dura mater, which form the cavernous sinuses. Separating the middle fossae is the sella Turcica, a deep depression, which lodges the pituitary gland, bounded in front by a small eminence on either side, the middle clinoid process, and behind by a broad square plate of bone, surmounted at each superior angle by a tubercle, the posterior chnoid process ; beneath the latter process is a groove, for the sixth nerve. On each side of the sella Turcica is the cavernous groove; it is broad, shallow, and curved somewhat like the italic letter /: it commences behind at the foramen lacerum medium, and terminates on the inner side of the anterior clinoid process. This groove lodges the cavernous sinus, the internal carotid artery, and the nerves of the orbit. The sides of the middle fossa are of considerable depth ; they present eminences and depressions for the middle lobes of the brain, and grooves for the branches of the middle meningeal artery; the latter commence on the outer side of the foramen spinosum, and consist of two large branches, an anterior and a posterior; the former passing upwards and forwards to the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, the latter passing upwards and backwards. The following foramina may also be seen from before backwards. Most anteriorly is "the foramen lacerum anterius, or sphenoidal fissure, formed above by the lesser wing of the sphenoid: below, by the greater wing ; internally, by the body of the sphenoid ; and completed exter- nally by the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It transmits the third, fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, the sixth nerve, and the ophthalmic vein. Behind the inner extremity of the sphenoidal fissure is the foramen rotundum, for the passage of the second division of the fifth or superior maxillary nerve; still more posteriorly is seen a small orifice, the foramen Vesalii, an opening, situated between the foramen rotundum and ovale, a little internal to both; it varies in size in different individuals, and is often absent; when present, it transmits a small vein. It opens below in the pterygoid fossa, just at the outer side of the scaphoid depression. Behind and external to the latter opening is the foramen ovale, which transmits the third division of the fifth or inferior maxillary nerve, the small meningeal artery, and the small petrosal nerve. On the outer side of the foramen ovale is the foramen spinosum, for the passage of the middle meningeal artery; and on the inner side of the foramen ovale, the foramen lacerum medium. The lower part of this aperture is filled up64 THE SKELETON. with cartilage in the recent state.

At the base of the internal pterygoid plate is a large and somewhat triangular aperture, the foramen lacerum medium, bounded in front by the great wmg of the sphenoid, behind by the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and internally by the body of the sphenoid and basilar process of the occipital bone; it presents m front the posterior orifice of the Vidian canal, behind, the aperture of the carotid canal. The basilar surface.of this opening is filled up in the recent state by a fibro-cartilaginous substance; across its upper or cerebral aspect passes the internal cai-otid artery and Vidian nerve. . External to this aperture, the petro- sphenoidal suture is observed, at the outer termination of which is seen the onfice of the canal for the Eustachian tube, and that for the Tensor tympani muscle. Behind this suture is seen the under surface of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, presenting, from within outwards, the quadrilateral rough surface, part of which affords attachment to the Levator palati and Tensor tympani muscles; external to this surface the orifices of the carotid canal and the aquseductus cochleae, the former transmitting the internal carotid artery and the ascending branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, the latter serving for the passage of a small artery and vein to the cochlea. Behind the carotid canal is a large aperture, the jugular fossa, formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal, and behind'by the occipital; it is generally larger on the right than on the left side ; and towards its cerebral aspect is divided into two parts by a ridge of bone, which projects usually from the temporal; the anterior, or smaller portion, transmitting the three divisions of the eighth pair of nerves, the posterior transmitting the internal jugular vein and the ascending meningeal vessels, from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries. On the ridge of bone dividing the carotid canal from the jugular fossa, is the small foramen for the transmission of the tympanic nerve ; and on the outer wall of the jugular foramen, near the root of the styloid process, is the small aperture for the transmission of Arnold's nerve. Behind the basilar surface of the occipital bone is the foramen magnum, bounded on each side by the condyles, rough internally for the attach- ment of the alar ligaments, and presenting externally a rough surface, the jugular process, which serves for the attachment of the B,ectus lateralis. On either' side of each condyle anteriorly is the anterior condyloid fossa, perforated by the anterior condyloid foramen, for the passage of the hypoglossal nerve. Behind each condyle are the posterior condyloid fossEe, perforated on one or both sides by the posterior condyloid foramina, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is the external occipital crest, terminating above at the external occipital protuberance, whilst on each side are seen the superior and inferior curved lines; these, as well as the surfaces of the bone between them, being rough for the attachment of the muscles, which are enumerated on page 20. Lateral Region of the Skull. The Lateral Region of the Skull is of a somewhat triangular form, the base of the triangle being formed by a line extendmg from the external angular process of tbe frontal bone along the temporal ridge backwards to the outer extremity of the superior curved line of the occiput: and the sides by two lines, the one drawn downwards and backwards from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the angle of the lower jaw, the other from the angle of the jaw upwards and backwards to the extremity of the superior curved line. This region is divisible into three portions, temporal, mastoid, and zygomatic. The Temporal Fossa. The Temporal fossa is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, which extends from the external angular process of the frontal upwards and backwards across the frontal and parietal bones, curving downwards behind to terminate at the postenor root of the zygomatic process. In front, it is bounded by the frontal, w 168 THE SKELETON. malar, and groat wing of tlie Rphcnoid : cxbcrnally, by the zygomatic arch, formed conjointly by the nuilur and temporal bones ; below, it in Hcpamted from the zygomatic fossa by the pterygoid ridgo, seen on the outer surface ot the great wing of the sphenoid.

It contains the lower part of the Temporal, the External and Internal pterygoid muscles, the internal maxillary artery, the mferior maxillary nerve, and theh branches. At its upper and inner part may bo observed two f^sures, the spheno-maxillary and iTtcrygo-maxillary. _ • , n j. j The SvhenoLaxillanj fissure, horizontal in direction, opens into the outer and back part of the orbit. It is formed above by the lower border of the orbi al surface of the great wing of the sphenoid; below, by the external border of the orbital surface of the superior maxilla and a small part of the palate bone ; externally, by a smaU part of the malar bone; internally, it joms at right angles with the pterygo-maxillary fissure. This fissure opens a communication from the orbit into three fosste, the temporal, zygomatic, and spheno-maxUlary; it transmits the superior maxillary nerve and its orbital branch, the intraoi?.t3itai arteiy, and ascending branches from Meckel's ganglion. The Fterygo-maxillary fissure is vertical, and descends at right angles from the innei- extremity of the preceding; it is an elongated interval, formed by the divergence of the superior maxillary bone from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. It serves to connect the spheno-maxillary fossa with the zygomatic, and transmits branches of the internal maxillary artery. It forms the entrance from the zygomatic fossa to The SpHENO-MAxiLiiART Fossa. The Spheno-maxillary fossa is a small triangular space situated at the angle of junction of the spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary fissures, amd placed beneath the apex of the orbit. It is formed above by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid or by the orbital plate of the palate bone; in front, by the superior maxillary bone; behind, by the pterygoid process of the sphenioid ; internally, by . the vertical plate of the palate. This fossa has three fissures terminatibg in it, the sphenoidal, spheno-maxillary, and pterygo-maxillary; it communicates with three fossse, the orbital, nasal, and zygomatic, and with the cavity of the cranium, and has opening into it five foramina. Of these there are three on the posterior wall; the foramen rotundum above j below, and internal to this, the Vidian, and still more inferior and internal, the pterygo-palatine. On the inner wall is the spheno-palatine foramen by which the spheno-maxillary commurn'eates with the nasal fossa, and below is the superioT orifice of the posterior palatine canal, besides occasionally the orifices of two or three accessory posteriar palatiire canals. Anteriok Region of the Skull. The Anterior Region of the Skull, which forms the face, is of an oval form, presents an irregular surface, and is excavated for the reception of the two prin- cipal organs of sense, the eye and the nose. It is bounded above by the na-sal eminences and margiusof the orbit; below^by the prominence of the chin ; on each side, by the malar bone, and anterior margin of the ramus of the jaw. In the median line are seen from above downwards, the nasal eminences, which indicate the situation of the frontal sinuses ; and diverging from which are the superciliary ridges which support the eyebrows. Beneath the nasal eminences is the arch of the nose, formed by the nasal bones, and the nasal processes of the superior maxillary. The nasal arch is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards, presenting in the median hne the internasal suture, formed between the nasal bones, laterally the naso-maxillary suture, for mod between the nasal bone and the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, both these sutures terminating above in that part of the transverse suture which connects the nasal bones and nasal processes of the superior maxillary with the frontal. Below the nose is seen the opening of the anterior nares, which is heart-shaped, with the narrow end upwards, and presents laterally the thin sharp margins serving for the attachment of the lateral cartilages of the nose, and in the middle lino below, a prominent process, the anterior nasal spine, bounded by two deep notches.

Lach orbit is formed seven bones the frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, malar lachrymal, and palate ; but three of these, the frontal, ethmoid and-sphenoid, enter into the for- mation of loth orbits, so that the two cavities are formed of eleven bones only. Eacb , f. • „ rnnf n floor an inner and an outer wall, tour cavity presents for examination, a loor, a uuui, u-f- -,- , j j angles, a circumference or base, and an apex. The Eoof is concave, directed down- wards and forwards, and formed in front by the orbital plate of the frontal; behind by the lesser wing of the sphenoid. This surface presents internally the depression for the fibro-cartilaginous pulley of the Superior oblique muscle ; externally, the depression for the lachrymal gland; and posteriorly, the suture connecting the frontal and lesser wing of the sphenoid. ^ x.- a x. The Floor is nearly flat, and of less extent than the roof ; it is formed chiefly by the orbital process of the superior maxillary ; in front, to a small extent, by the orbital process of the malar, and behind, by the orbital surface of the palate. This surface presents at its anterior and internal part, just external to the lachrymal canal, a depression for the attachment of the Inferior oblique muscle ; externally, the suture between the malar and superior maxillary bones> near its middle, the infra- orbital groove; and posteriorly, the suture between the maxillary and palate bones. The Inrier Wall is flattened, and formed from before backwards by the nasal pro- cess of the superior maxillary, the lachrymal, os planum of the ethmoid, and a small part of the body of the sphenoid. This surface presents the lachrymal groove, and crest of the lachrymal bone, and the sutures connecting the ethmoid with the lachry- mal bone in front, and the sphenoid behind. The Older Wall is formed in front by the orbital process of the malar bone ; be- hind, by the orbital plate of the sphenoid. On it are seen the orifices of one or two malar canals, and the suture connecting the sphenoid and malar bone». Angles. The sttiierior external angle is formed by the junction of the upper and outer walls ; it presents, from before backwards, the suture connectiug the frontal with the malar in front, and with the orbital plate of the sphenoid behind ; quite posteriorly is the foramen lacerum anterius, or sphenoidal fissure, which transmits the third, fourth, the ophthalmic division of the fifth and the sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. The superior internal angle is formed by the junction of the upper and inner wall, and presents the suture connecting the frontal bone with the lachry- mal in front, and with the ethmoid behind. This suture is perforated by two foramina, the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, the former transmitting the anterior ethmoidal artery and nasal nerve, the latter the posterior ethmoidal artery and vein. The inferior external angle, formed by the junction of the outer wall or floor, pre- sents the spheno-maxillary fissure, which transmits the infraorbital vessels and nerve, and the ascending branches from the spheno-palatine ganglion. The inferior internal angle is formed by the union of the lachrymal and os planum of the ethmoid, with the superior maxillary and palate bones. The circimiference, or base, of the orbit, quadrilateral in form, is bounded above by the supraorbital arch ; below, by the anterior border of the orbital plate of the malar, supeinor maxillary, and lachrymal bones ; externally, by the externail angular process of the frontal and the malar bone; internally, by the internal angular process of the frontal, and the nasal process of the superior maxillary. The ciiuumference is marked by three sutures, the fronto-maxillary internally, the fronto-nialar externally, and the malo-maxillary below ; it contributes to the formation of the lachrymal groove, and presents above the supraorbital notch (or foramen), for the passage of the supraorbital artery, veins and nerve. The ape.«, situated at the back of the orbit, corresponds to the optic foramen, a short circular canal, which transmits the optic nerve and ophthal- mic artery. It will thus be seen that there arc nine openings communicating witli each orbit, viz. the optic, foramen lacerum anterius, spheno-maxillary fissure, supra-72 THE SKELETON. orbital foramen, infraorbital canal, anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, malar foramina, and lachrymal canal. To these may be added the external orbital fora- mina, when present. The "Nasal Foss;e. The Nascd Fossce are two large irregular cavities, situated in the middle line of the face, extending from the base of the cranium to the roof of the mouth, and separated from each other by a thin vertical septuni. They communicate by two laro-e apertures, the anterior nares, with the front of the face; and with the pha- rynx behind by the two posterior nares. These fossa3 are much nai-rower above than below, and in the middle than at the anterior or posterior openings: their depth, which is considerable, is much greater in the middle than at either extremity. Each nasal fossa communicates with four sinuses, the frontal above, the sphenoidal behind, and the maxillary and ethmoidal on either side. Each fossa also commu- nicates with four cavities : with the orbit by the lachrymal canal, with the mouth by the anterior palatine canal, with the cranium by the olfactory foramina, and 66,—Eoof, Floor, and Outer.

Each cavity is bounded by a roof, a floor, an inner and an outor wall. The uvper wall, or roof (fig. 66), is long, narrow, and concave from before back- wards -, it is formed in front by the nasal bones and nasal spme of the .rental, wlncii are directed downwards and forwards ; in the middle, by the cnbnforni lamella of the ethmoid, which is horizontal; and behind, by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and sphenoidal turbinated iK.nos, which are dn-ccted downwards and backwards. This surface presents, from before ba<3kwards, the mternal aspect the nasal bones ; on their outer side, the suture formed between the -^^^^ bo°« ^J'^ tTie nasal process of the superior maxillary ; on their inner side the elevated crest which receives the nasal spine of the frontal, and the perpendicular plate of theNASAL FOSS^. 73 efchmoid and articulates with its fellow of the opposite side ; whilst the surface of the bones is perforated by a few small vascular apertures, and presents the longi- tudinal groove for the nasal nerve: further back is the transverse suture, connect- in- the frontal with the nasal in front, and the ethmoid behind, the olfactory foramina and nasal slit on the under surface of the cribriform plate, |nd the suture between it and the sphenoid behind: quite posteriorly are seen the sphenoidal turbinated bones, the orifices of the sphenoidal sinuses and the articulation of the alse of the vomer with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid. The floor is flattened from before backwards, concave from side to side, and wider in the middle than at either extremity. It is formed in front by the palate process of the superior maxillary; behind, by the palate process of the palate bone. This surface presents, from before backwards, the anterior nasal spme ; behind this the upper orifice of the anterior palatine canal; internally, the elevated crest which articulates with the vomer; and behind, the suture between the palate and superior maxillary bones, and the posterior nasal spine. The inner ivall, or septum (fig. 67), is a thin vertical partition, which separates the nasal fossis from one another; it is occasionally perforated, so that the fossae 67.—Inner Wall of Nasal Fossbb, or Septum of Nose, Cftst of Nasal lione. tfusaL SpiiiiB aJf nmlalM- Space for Triaiujular CaHilutje oj Septum Crest tf fSu.£.Ma,xill.£iine communicate, and it is frequently deflected considerably to one side.

It presents, in front, a large triangular notch, which receives the triangular cartilage of the nose; above, the lower orifices of the olfactory canals; and behind, the guttural edge of the vomer. Its surface is marked by numerous vascular and nervous canals and the groove for the naso-palatine nerve, and is traversed by sutures connecting the bones of which it is formed. The outer wall (fig. 66) is formed, in fi-ont, by the nasal process of the superior maxillary and lachrymal bones ; in the middle, by the ethmoid and inner surface of the superior maxillary and inferior turbinated bones ; behind, by the vertical plate of the palate bone, and the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid.

It also gives attachment to the thyro-hyoidean membrane, and the stylo-hyoid, thyro-hyoid, and hyo-epiglottic ligaments. THE THORAX. The Thorax, or chest, is an osseo-cartilaginous cage, intended to contain and protect the principal organs of respiration and circulation. It is the largest of the three cavities connected with the spine, and is formed by the sternum and costal cartilages in front, the twelve ribs on each side, and the bodies of the dorsal vertebra behind. The Steenum. The Sternum (figs. 69, 70) is a flat narrow bone, situated in the median line of the front of the chest, and consisting, in the adult, of three portions. It has been likened to an ancient sword : the upper piece, representing the handle, is termed the mamibrimn; the middle and largest piece, which represents the chief part of the blade, is termed the gladiolus; and the inferior piece, which is likened to the point of the sword, is termed the ensiform or xiphoid appendix. In its natural position, its inclination is oblique from above, downwards, and forwards. It is flattened in front, concave behind, broad above, becoming narrowed at the point where the first and second pieces are connected ; after which it again widens a little, and is pointed at its extremity. Its average length in the adult is six inches, being rather longer in the male than in the female. The First Piece of the sternum, or manuhrkim, is of a somewhat triangular form, broad and thick above, naiTOw below at its junction with the middle piece. Its anterior surface^ convex from side to side, concave from above downwards, is smooth, and affords attachment on each side to the Pectoralis major and sternal origin of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. In well-marked bones, the ridges limiting the a,ttachm€nt of these muscles are very distinct. Its posterior sxirface, concave and smooth, affords attachment on each side to the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles. The superior border, the thickest, presents at its centre the interclavicular notch; and on each side, an oval articular surface, dii-ected upwards, backwards, and outwards, for articulation with the sternal end of the clavicle. The inferior harder presents an oval rough surface, covered in the recent state with a thin layer of cai-tilage, for articulation with the second portion of the bone.* The Uteral borders are marked above by an articular depression _ _ • The second piece of the sternum is united to the first either by an nmpbinrthrodial .lomt-n single piece of true hbro-cartilnp:e uniting the segments—or by a diavthrodial joint, in which each bone is clothed with a distinct lamina of cartilage, adherent on one side free and lined with synovial membrnne on tbe other.

These articular surfaces are sepa- rated by a narrow curved edge, which slopes from above downwards and inwards. The Second Piece of the sternum, or gladiolus, considerably longer, narrower, and thinner than the first piece, is broader below than above. Its antenor surfaoe is nearly flat, directed upwards and forwards, and marked by three transverse Imes which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. These lines are produced by the union of the four separate pieces of jhich this part of the bone consists at an early period of life. At the junction of the third and fourth pieces, is occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen ; it varies in size and form in different individuals, and pierces the bone from before backwards. This surface affords attachment on each side to the sternal origin of the Pectorabs major. The posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines; but they are less distinct than those in front: this surface affords attachment below, on each side, to the Triangularis sterni muscle, and occasionally presents the posterior opening of the sternal foramen. The superior harder presents an oval surface for articulation with the manubrium. The inferior border is narrow and articulates with the ensiform appendix. Bach lateral border presents at each superior angle a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the manubrium, forms a cavity for the cartilage of the second rib; the four succeeding angular depressions . receive the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, whilst each inferior angle presents a small facet, which, with a corresponding one on the ensifonn appendix, forms a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib. These articular depressions are separated by a series of curved inter-articular intervals, which diminish in length from above downwards, and correspond to the intercostal spaces. Most of the cartilages belonging to the true ribs, as will be seen from the foregoing description, articulate with the sternum at the line of junction of two of its primi- tive component segments. This is well seen in many of the lower animals, where the separate parts of the bone remain ununited longer than in man. In this respect a striking analogy exists between the mode of connection of the ribs with the vertebral column, and the connection of their cartilages with the stei'nal column. The Third Piece of the sternum, the ensiform or xijyhoid appendix, is the smallest of the three ; it is thin and elongated in form, cartilaginous in structure in youth, but more or less ossified at its upper part in the adult. Its anterior surface affords attachment to the costo-xiphoid ligament; its posterior surface, to some of the fibres of the Diaphragm and Triangularis sterni muscles : its lateral borders, to the aponeurosis of the abdominal muscles. Above, it is continuous with the lower end of the gladiolus; below, by its pointed extremity, it gives attachment to the linea alba, and at each superior angle presents a facet for the lower half of the cartilage of the seventh rib. This portion of the sternum is very various in appear- ance, being sometimes pointed, broad and thin, sometimes bifid, or perforated by a round hole, occasionally curved, or deflected considerably to one or the other side. Structure. The bone is composed of delicate cancellated texture, covered by a thin layer of compact tissue, which is .thickest in the manubrium, between the articular facets for the clavicles. Bevelopment. The sternum; including the ensiform appendix, is developed hy six centres: one for the first piece or manubrium, four for tlie second piece or gladiolus, and one for the ensiform appendix. Up to the middle of foetal life, the sternum is entirely cartilaginous, and when ossification takes place, the ossific grannies are deposited m the middle of the intervals between the articular depi-essions for the costal cartilages, in the following order (fig. 71). In the first piece, between the fifth and sixth months; in the second and third, between the sixth and seventh months; in the fourth piece, at the ninth month; in the fifth, withm the first year or between the first and second.years after birth; and in the ensiform appendix, between the second and the seventeenth or eighteenth years, by a single centre which makes its appearance at the upper part, and78 proceeds gradually down- wards. To these may be added the occasional ex- istence, as described by Breschet, of two small epi- sternal centres, wliicli make their appearance one on each side of the inter- clavicular notch. These are regarded by him as the anterior rudiments of a rib, of which the posterior rudiment is the anterior lamina of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. It occasionally happens that some of the segments are formed from more than one centre, the num- ber and position of which vary (fig. 73)- Thus the first piece may have two, three, or even six centres. When two are present, they are generally situated one above the other, the upper one being the larger ; the second piece has seldom more than one ; the third, fourth, and fifth pieces are often formed from two centres placed laterally, the irregular union of which will serve to explain the occasional occurrence of the sternal foramen (fig. 74), or of the vertical fissure which occasionally intersects this part of the bone. Union of the va- rious centres commences from below, and proceeds upwards, taking place in the following order (fig.. 72). The fifth piece is joined to the fourth soon after puberty; the fourth to the third, between the twentieth and twenty- fifth years; the third to thja second, between the thirty-fifth and fortieth years; the second is occa- sionally joined to the first, especially at an advanced age.

The Ribs. The Ribs are elastic arches of bone, whicli form the chief part of the thoracic walls. They are twelve in number on each side; but this number may be increased by the development of a cervical or lumbar rib, or may be diminished to eleven. The first seven are connected behind with the spine, and in front with .the sternum, through the intervention of the costal caii;ilages; they are called vertebro- sternal, ov true ribs. The remaining five are false ribs ; of these the first three, being connected behind with the spine, and in front with the costal cartilages, are usually called the vertehro-costal, but would be better named the vertebro- chondral ribs : the last two are connected with the vertebrae only, being free at their anterior extremities; they are termed ver- tebral or floating ribs. The ribs vary in their direction, the upper ones being placed nearly at right angles with the spine, the lower ones obliquely, so that the anterior extremity is lower than the posterior. The extent of obliquity reaches its maximum at the ninth rib, and gradu- ally decreases from that rib to the twelfth. The ribs are situated one below the other in such a manner that spaces are left between them, which are called intercostal spaces. Their length corre- sponds to the length of the ribs, their breadth is more considerable in front than behind, and between the upper than be- tween the lower ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the seventh, when they again diminish to the twelfth. In breadth they decrease from above downwards; in each rib the greatest breadth is at the sternal extremity. Comwon characters of the Bibs (fig. 75). A rib from the middle of the series should be taken in order to study the common characters of the ribs. Each rib presents two extremities, a posterior or vertebral, an anterior or sternal, and an intei'vening portion, the8o THE SKIOLETON. body or sliaft.

The inferior edge corresponds to the lower margin of the rib, and gives attachment to the External intercostal. Within the groove are seen the orifices of numerous small foramina, which traverse the wall of the shaft obliquely from before backwards. The superior border, thick and rounded, is marked by an external and an internal lip, more distinct behind than in front; they serve for the attachment of the External and Internal intercostal muscles. The inferior border, thin and sharp, has attached the External intercostal muscle. The anterior or sternal extremity is flattened, and presents a porous oval concave depression, into which the costal cartilage is received. Peculiae Ribs. The ribs which require especial consideration are five in number, viz., the first, second, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first rib (fig. 77) is one of the shortest and the most curved of all the ribs ; it is broad, flat, and placed horizontally at the upper part of the thorax, its surfaces looking upwards and downwards; and its borders inwai-ds and outwards. The head is of small size, rounded, and presents only a single articular facet for arti- culation with the body of the first dorsal vertebra. The nech is narrow and rounded. The tuberosity, thick and prominent, rests on the outer border. There is no angle, and the shaft is not twisted on its axis. The upper surface of the shaft is marked by two shallow depressions, separated from one another by a ridge, which becomes more prominent towards the internal border, where it terminates in a tubercle : this tubercle and ridge serve for the attachment of the Scalenus anticus muscle, the groove in front of it transmitting the subclavian vein : that behind it, the subclavian artery. Between the groove for the subcla- vian artery apd the tuberosity is a depression for the attachment of the Scalenus medins muscle. The under surface is smooth, and destitute of the groove observed on the other ribs. The oider border is convex, thick, and rounded ; the inner, concave, thin, and sharp, and marked about its centre by the tubercle before mentioned. The anterior extremity is larger and thicker than any of the other ribs. The second rib (fig. 78) is much longer than the first, but bears a very con- siderable resemblance to it in the direction of its curvature. The non-articular portion of the tuberosity is occasionally only slightly marked. The angle is slight, and situated close to the tuberosity, and the shaft is not twisted, so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid. The shaft is not horizontal, hke that of the first rib ; its outer surface, which is convex, looking upwards and a httle outwards. It presents, near the middle, a rough eminence for the attach- ment of the second and third digitations of the Serratus magnus. The inner surface, smooth and concave, is directed downwards and a little inwards • it presents a short groove towards its posterior part. The tenth rib (fig. 79) has only a single articular facet on its head. The ehventhj,nd twelfth ribs (figs. 80 and 81) have each a single articular facet on the head which is of rather large size ; they have no neck or tuberosity, and are pointed at the extremity.

The cartilages of the last two ribs, which have pointed extremities, float freely in the walls of the abdomen. Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth, and direction. They increase in length from the first to the seventh, then gradually diminish to the last. They diminish in breadth, as well as the intervals between them, from the first to the last. They are broad at their attachment to the ribs, and taper towards their sternal extremities, excepting the first two, which are of the same length throughout, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact. In direction they also vary ; the first descends a little, the second is horizontal, the third ascends slightly, whilst all the rest follow the course of the ribs for a short extent, and then ascend to the sternum or preceding cartilage. Each costal cartilage presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The anterior surface is convex, and looks forwards and up- wards ; that of the first gives attachment to the costo-clavicular ligament; that of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, at their sternal ends, to the Pectoralis major. The others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the great flat muscles of the abdomen. The posterior surface is concave, and directed back- wards and downwards, the six or seven inferior ones afibrding attachment to the Transversalis muscle, and the Diaphragm. Of the two borders, the superior is concave ; the inferior, convex; they alFord attachment to the Intercostal muscles, the upper border of the sixth giving attachment to the Pectoralis major muscle. The contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the ninth and tenth costal cartilages present smooth oblong surfaces at the points where they articulate. Of the two extremities, the outer one is continuous with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs. The inner extremity of the first is continuous with the sternum; the six succeeding ones have rounded extremities, which are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins of the sternum. The inner extremities of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages are pointed, and lie in contact with the cartilage above. Those of the eleventh and twelfth are free, and pointed. The costal cartilages are most elastic in youth, those of the false ribs being more so than the true. In old age, they become of a deep yellow colour. Under certain diseased conditions, they are prone to ossify. Dr. Humphry's observations on this subject have led him to regard the ossification of the costal cartilages as a sign of disease rather than of age. ' The ossification takes place in the first carti- lage sooner than in the others; and in men more frequently, and at an earlier period of life than in women.' Attachment of ifuscles.

Between the two musculai- impressions is a small subcutaneous interval. The posterior or cervical surface is smooth, flat, directed vertically, and looks backwards towards the root of the neck.

This surface is continuous with the costal facet on the inner end of the inferior or subclavian surface, which articulates with the cartilage of the first rib. The outer or acromial extremity, directed outwards and forwards, presents a small, flattened, oval facet, which looks obliquely downwards, for articulation with the acromion process of the scapula. The direction of this surface serves to expkm the greater frequency of dislocation upwards rather than downwards, beneath the acromion process. The circamference of the articular facet is rough, especially above, for the attachment of the acromio-clavicular ligaments. Peculiarities of the Bone in the Sexes and in Individuals. In the female, the clavicle is generally less curved, smoother, and more slender than in the niale. In those persons who perform considerable manual labour, which brings into constant action the muscles connected with this bone, it acquires considerable bulk becomes shorter, more curved, its ridges for muscular attachment become prominently marked, and its sternal end of a prismatic form. The right cla- vicle is generally heavier, thicker, and rougher, and often shorter, than the Structure. The shaft, as well as the extremities, consists of cancellous tissue, invested in a compact layer much thicker in the middle than at either end. The clavicle is highly elastic, by reason of its curves. From the experiments ot Mr Ward it has been shown that it possesses sufficient longitudinal elastic force to project its own weight nearly two feet on a level surface, when a smart blow is struck on it, and sufficient transverse elastic force, opposite the centre ot its anterior convexity, to throw its own weight about a foot. This extent of elastic power must serve to moderate very considerably the effect of concussions received upon the point of the shoulder. , ^ . i 4^ Development. By tioo centres : one for the shaft, and one for the sternal exfae- mitv The centre for the shaft appears very early, before any other bone ; the centre for the sternal end makes its appeaa-ance about the eighteenth or twentieth year and unites with the rest of the bone a few years after.

It presents tor examination two surfaces, three borders, and three angles. ^ ?he anterior surface, or venter (fig. 84), presents a broad concavity, the sub- scapulL fossa It is marked, in the posterior two-thirds, by several oblique ridges, wS pass from behind obliquely outwards and upwards, the anterior third being Tmooth' The oblique ridges'give attachment to ^.n^"--/-—f' ^^^^ the. surfaces between them, to the fleshy fibres, of the Subscapularis muscl .

It is sabdmded unequally mto two parts by the spine; the portion above the spine is called the supraspinous -fossa, and that below it, the iniraspinous fossa. ,1, „ j j The sup-aspinous fossa, the smaller of the two, is concave smooth, and broader, at the vertebral than at the humeral extremity. It affords attachment by its inner two-thii-ds to the Supraspinatus muscle. 84.—Left Scapula.

The ridge serves for the attachment of a strong aponeurosis, which sepa- rates the Infraspinatus from the two Teres muscles. The surface of bone between this line and the axillary border is narrow in the upper two-thirds of its extent, and traversed near its centre, by a groove for the passage of the dorsalis scapulae vessels; it affords attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and 85.—Left Scapula. Poaterior Surface, or Dorsum. over which glides the Latissimus dorsi ; sometimes the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibres from this part. The broad and narrow portions of bone above alluded to are separated by an oblique Kne, which runs from the axillary border, downwards and backwards : to it is attached the nponeuro-sis separating the two Teres muscles from each other. The Spine is a prominent plate of bone, which crosses obliquely the inner four-fifths of the dorsum of the scapula at its upper part, and separat<?s the89 SCAPULA. supra- from the infraspinous fossa: it commences at the vertebral border by a smooth triangular surface, over which the Trapezius glides, separated from the bone by a bursa : and, gradually becoming more elevated as it passes forwards, terminates in the acromion process which overhangs the shoulder-joint. The spine is triangular, and flattened from above downwards, its apex corresponding to the posterior border; its base, which is directed outwards, to the neck of the scapula. It presents two surfaces and three borders. Its superior surface is concave, assists in forming the supraspinous fossa, and affords attachment to part of the Supraspinatus muscle. Its inferior surface forms part of the infraspinous fossa, gives origin to part of the Infraspinatus muscle, and presents near its centre the orifice of a nutrient canal. Of the three borders, the anterior is attached to the dorsum of the bone; the posterior, or crest of the spine, is broad, and presents two lips, and an intervening rough interval. To the superior lip is attached the Trapezius, to the extent shown in the figure. A very rough tubercle is generally seen occupying that portion of the spine which receives the insertion of the middle and inferior fibres of this muscle. To the inferior lip, throughout its whole length, is attached the Deltoid. The interval between the lips is also partly covered by the fibres of these muscles. The external border, the shortest of the three, is slightly concave, its edges thick and round, continuous above with the under surface of the acromion process ; below, with the neck of the scapula. The narrow portion of bone external to this border serves to connect the supra- and infraspinous fossse. The Acromion process, so called from forming the summit of the shoulder (iiKpor, a summit; wfioc, the shoulder), is a large and somewhat triangular process, flattened from behind forwards, directed at first a little outwards, and then curving forwards and upwards, so as to overhang the glenoid cavity. Its upjier surface, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, is convex, rough, and gives attachment 'to some fibres of the Deltoid. Its under surface is smooth and concave. Its outer harder, which is thick and irregular, affords attachment to the Deltoid muscle. Its inner margin, shorter than the outer, is concave, gives attachment to a portion of the Trapezius muscle, and presents about its centre a small oval surface, for articulation with the acromial end of the clavicle. Its apex, which corresponds to the point of meeting of these two borders in front, is thin, and has attached to it the coraco.acromial ligament. _ Of the three borders or costaa of the scapula, the superior is the shortest and thinnest; it is concave, terminating at its inner extremity at the superior ano-le at Its outer extremity at the coracoid process. At its outer part is a deep semicircular notch, the suprascapular, formed partly by the base of the coracoid process This notch is converted into a foramen by the transverse ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve. The adjacent margin of the superior border affords attachment to the Omo-hyoid muscle. The external, or a^Mary, border is the thickest of the three. It commences above at the lower margin ot the g enoid cavity, and inchnes obliquely downwards and backwards to the inferior augle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity, is a rough impression about an mch m length, which affords attachment to the iong head of the Triceps ZrtV," J^V^^^^^.^^^^ longitudinal groove, which extends as far as its owe third, and affords ongm o part of the Subscapularis muscle.

Of the three angles, the S'lqjerior, formed by the junction of the superior and internal borders, is thin, smooth, rounded, somewhat inclined outwards, and gives attachment to a few fibres of the Levator anguli scapula) muscle. The inferior angle, thick and rough, is formed by the union of the vertebral and axillary borders, its outer surface affordhig attachment to the Teres major, and occasionally a few fibres of the Latissimus dorsi. The anterior angle is the thickest part of the bone, and forms what is called the head of the scapula. The head presents a shal- low, pyriform, articular surface, the glemid cavity (yXrji't], a socket), whose lougest diameter is from above downwards, and its direction outwards and forwards. It is broader below than above ; at its apex is attached the long tendon of the Biceps muscle. It is covered with cartilage in the recent state ; and its margins, slightly- raised, give attachment to a fibro-cartilaginous structure, the glenoid ligament, by which its cavity is deepened. The neck of the scapula is the slightly depressed surface which surrounds the head; it is more distinct on the posterior than on the anterior surface, and below than above. In the latter situation, it has, arising from it, a thick prominence, the coracoid process. The Goracoid process, so called from its fancied resemblance to a crow's beak (Kopal, a crow), is a thick curved process of bone, which arises by a broad base from the upper part of the neck of the scapula; it is directed at first upwards and inwards ; then, becoming smaller, it changes its direction, and passes forwards and outwards. The ascending portion, flattened from before backwards, presents in front a smooth concave surface, over whicb passes the Subscapularis muscle. The horizontal portion is flattened from above downwards; its upper surface is convex and irregular ; its under surface is smooth ; its anterior border is rough, and gives attachment to the Pectorahs minor; its posterior border is also rough for the coraco-acromial ligament, while the apex is embraced by the conjoined tendon of origin of the short head of the Biceps and Coraco-brachialis muscles. At the inner side of the root of the coracoid process is a rough impression for the attachment of the conoid Hgament, and, running from it obliquely forwards and outwards on the upper surface of the horizontal portion, an elevated ndge for the attachment of the trapezoid hgament. Structure. In the head, processes, and aU the thickened parts of the bone, it is cellular in structure, of a dense compact tissue in the rest of its extent. The centre and upper part of the dorsum, but especially the former, is usually so thin as to be semi-transparent; occasionally the bone is found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles come into contact. Development (fig. 86). By seven centres : one for the body, two for the coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the posterior border, and one for the inferior angle Ossification of the body of the scapula commences about the second month of foetal life by the formation of an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone, imme- diately behind the glenoid cavity. This plate extends itself so as to form the chief part of the bone, the spine growing up from its posterior surface about tli^ thii-d month. At birth, the chief part of the scapula is osseous, only the coracoid and acromion processes, the posterior border, and inferior angle, being cai-tilagmous. About the first year after birth, ossification takes place in the middle ot the coracoid process; which usually becomes joined with the rest of the bone at the time when the other centres make their appearance. Between the htteenth and seventeenth years, ossification of the remaining centres takes place in quick suc- cession, and in the following order : first, near the ba«c of the acromion, and m the root of the coracoid process, the latter appearing in the form of a broad scale ; secondly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the posterior border ; thirdly, near Ihe extremity of the acromion; fourthly, in the posterior border The acromion process, besides being formed of two separate nuclei, has its baseHUMERUS. 91 formed by an extension into it of the centre of ossification which belongs to the spine the extent of which varies in diiferent cases. The two sepai-ate nuclei unite and then join with the extension carried in from the spine. These various epiphyses become joined to the bone between the ages of twenty-two and twenty- 86.—Plan of the Development of the Scapula. By Seven Centres. The epiphyses (except one for the Coracoid process) appear from fifteen to seventeen years, and unite between twenty-two and twenty-five years of age. five years. Sometimes failure of union between the acromion process and spine occurs, the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation ; in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.

Posterior Surface. trochlear surface is seen a smaller de- pression, the coronoid fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the forearm. These fossaa are separated from one another by a thin transparent lamina of bone, which is sometimes perforated; their margins afford attachment to the anterior and posterior ligaments of the elbow-joint, and they are lined in the recent state by the synovial membrane of this articula- tion. Above the front part of the radial tuberosity is seen a slight depression, which receives the anterior border of the head of the radius when the forearm is strongly flexed. The external condyle is a small tubercular eminence, less pro- minent than the internal, curved a little forwards, and giving attachment to the external lateral ligament of the elbow- joint, and to a tendon common to the origin of some of the extensor and su- pinator muscles. The internal condyle, larger and more prominent than the ex- ternal, is directed a little backwards : it gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament, and to a tendon common to the origin of some of the flexor muscles of the forearm. The ulnar nerve runs in a groove at the back of the internal con- dyle, or between it and the olecranon process. These eminences are directly continuous above with the external and internal borders. The greater prominence of the inner one renders it more liable to fracture. Structure. The extremities consist of cancellous tissue, covered with a thin compact layer ; the shaft is composed of a cyhnder of compact tissue, thicker at the centre than at the extremities, and hollowed out by a large medullary canal, which extends along its whole length. Develojnnent. By seven centres (fig. 89) : one for the shaft, one for the head, one for the greater tuberosity, one for the I'adial, one for the ti-ochlear portion of the articular surface, and one for each condyle. The centre for the shaft appears very early, soon after ossifica- tion has commenced in the clavicle, and soon extends towards the extremities. At birth the humerus is ossified nearly in its whole length, the extremities re- maining cartilaginous.

The anterior border commences above at the prominent inner angle of the coro- noid process, and terminates below in front of the styloid process. It is well marked above, smooth and rounded in the middle of its extent, and aflfords attachment to the Flexor profundus digitorum: sharp and prominent in its lower fourth for the attachment of the Pronator quadratus. It separates the anterior from the internal surface. Tbe posterior border commences above at the apex of the triangular surface at the back part of the olecranon, and terminates below at the back part of the styloid process ; it is well marked in tbe upper three-fourths, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis common to the Plexor carpi ulnaris, the Extensor carpi ulnaris, and the Plexor profundus digitorum muscles : its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. This border separates the internal from the posterior surface. The external or interosseous border commences above by two lines, which converge one from each extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity, enclosing between them a trian- gular space for the attachment of part of the Supinator brevis, and terminates below at the middle of the head of the ulna. Its two middle fourths are very prominent, and serve for the attachment of the interosseous membrane ; its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. This border separates the anterior from the posterior surface. The anterior surface, much broader above than below, is concave in the upper three-fourths of its extent, and affords attachment to the Plexor profundus digi- torum ; its lower fom-th, also concave, to the Pronator quadratus. The lower fourth is separated from the remaining portion of the bone by a prominent ridge, directed ohhquely from above downwards and inwards ; this ridge marks the extent of attachment of the Pronator above. At the junction of the upper with the middle thu-d of the bone is the nutrient canal, directed obliquely upwards and inwards. The posterior surface, directed backwards and outwards, is broad and concave above, somewhat narrower and convex in the middle of its course, narrow, smooth, and rounded below. It presents above an oblique ridge, which runs from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity, downwards to the posterior border; the triangular suiface above this ridge receives the insertion of the Anconeus muscle, whilst the ridge itself affords attachment to the Supinator brevis. The surface of bone below this is subdivided by a longitudinal ridge, sometimes called the pei-pendicular line, into two parts : the internal part is smooth, concave, and gives origin to (occasionally is merely covered by) the Extensor carpi ulnaris ; the external portion, wider and rougher, gives attachment from above downwards to part ot the feupmator brevis, the Extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, the Extensor secundi mternodii poUicis, and the Extensor indicis muscles. The mternal surface is broad and concave above, narrow and convex below. It gives attachment by its upper three-fourths to the Plexor profundus digitorum muscle: its lower fourth is subcutaneous.

THE HAND. The skeleton of the Hand is subdivided into three segments—the Carpus or wrist bones, the Metacarpus or bones of the palm, and the Phalanges or bones of the fingers. The Caepus. The bones of the Carpus, eight in number, are arranged in two rows. Those ot the upper row, enumerated from the radial to the nbiar side, are the scaphoid, semiluna,r, cuneiform, and pisiform; those of the lower row, enumerated in the same order, are the trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and uncifoi-m. Common Characters op the Carpal Bores. _ Each bone (excepting the pisiform) presents six surfaces. Of these, the ante- 71 the posterior or dor.ml, are rough, for ligamentous attachment, the dorsal surface bemg generally the broader of the two. The superior and !wr°7'°f*^'? '\ «"P«rior generally convex, the inferior concave ; and the mternal and exte,-nal are also articular when in contact with contiguous bones, otherwise rough and tubercular. Their structure in all is similar, consistingI04 THE SKELETON. Avitbin of cancellous tissue enclosed in a layer of compact bone. Eacb bone is also developed from a single centre of ossification. Bones of the Upper Row. (Figs. 94, 95.) The Scaphoid is tbe largest bone of the first row. It has received its name from its fancied resemblance to a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite. It is situated at the upper and outer part of the carpus, its direction being from above downwards, outwards, and forwards. The ewper^or surface is convex, smooth, of triangular shape, and articulates with the lower end of the radius The inferior surface, directed downwards, outwards, and backwards, is smooth, convex, also triangular, and divided by a shght ridge into two parts, the external of which articulates with the trapezium, the inner with the trapezoid. The posterior or dorsal surface presents a narrow, rough groove, which mns the entire breadth of the bone, and serves for the attachment of ligaments, ihe anterior or palmar surfa.ce is concave above, and elevated at its lower and outer Tjart into a prominent rounded tubercle, which projects forwards from the front of the carpus and gives attachment to the anterior annular hgament of the wrist The external surface is rough and narrow, and gives attachment to_ the external lateral li-ament of the wrist. The internal surface presents two articular tacets : of these °the superior or smaller one is flattened, of semilunar form, and articulates with the semilunar ; the inferior or larger is concave, forming with the semilunar bone, a concavity for the head of the OS magnum. _ Lav it with the dorsal surface, i.e., the narrow nonarticular grooved surface, on the table, and the convex radial articular surface towards you. The tubercle is outwards, i.e., points to the side to which the bone belongs.* ZLutioJ. With five bones : the radius above, trapezium and trapezoid below, OS mas-num and semilunar internally. The Semilunar bone may be distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline It is situated in the centre of the upper row of the cai-pus between the scaphoid and cuneiform. The superior surface, convex, smooth, and bounded by S edges, articulates with the radius. The inferior surface is deeply concave, and of greater extent from before backwards than transversely ; it ai'ticulates with he head of the os magnum, and by a long narrow facet (separated by a ndge from the Ineral surface) with the unciform bone. The anterior or palmar and posteuor or dZ!at surfaces ire rough, for the attachment of ligaments, the former being the Wder and of somewhat rounded form.

The Pisiform bone may be known by its small size, and by its presenting a sin^^le articular facet. It is situated at the anterior and inner side of the carpus, is nearly circular in form, and presents on its posterior surface a smooth oval facet, for articulation with the cuneiform bone. This facet approaches the superior, but not the inferior, border of the bone. The anterior or palmar surface is rounded and rouo-h and gives attachment to the anterior annular ligament. The outer and inner surfaces are also rough, the former being convex, the latter usually concave. Lay it with the articular facet on the table, and the nonarticular part ot the same surface in front.

It may be distinguished by a deep eroove, for the tendon of the Flexor carpi radiaHs muscle. It is situated at the external and inferior part of the carpus, between the scaphoid and first meta- carpal bone. The superior surface, concave and smooth, is directed upwards and inwards, and articulates with the scaphoid. The inferior surface, directed down- wards and outwards, is oval, concave from side to side convex from before back- wards so as to form a saddle-shaped surface, for articulation with the base of the first metacarpal bone. The anterior or palmar surface is nai-row and rough. At its upper part is a deep groove, running from above obhquely downwards and Awards it transmits the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis, and is _ bounded exlemally by a prominent ridge, the obUque ridge of the trapezmm.

To two : the Plexor brevis minimi digiti, the Flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti ; and to the anterior annular hgament. The Metacarpus. The Metacarpal bones are five in number: they are long cylindrical bones, presenting for examination a shaft, and two extremities. Common Characters of the Metacarpal Bones. The slmft is prismoid in form, and curved longitudinally, so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. It presents three surfaces: two lateral, and one posterior. The lateral surfaces are concave, for the attach- ment of the Interossei muscles, and separated from one another by a prominent line. The posterior or dorsal surface is triangular, smooth, and flattened below, and covered, in the recent state, by the tendons of the Extensor muscles. In its upper half it is divided by a ridge into two narrow lateral depressions, for the attachment of the Dorsal interossei muscles. This ridge bifurcates a little above the centre of the bone, and its branches run to the small tubercles on each side of the digital extremity. The carpal extremity, or lase, is of a cuboidal form, and broader behind than in front: it articulates above with the carpus, and on each side with the adjoining metacarpal bones ; its dorsal and palmar surfaces being rough, for the attachment of tendons and ligaments. The digital extremity, or head, presents an oblong surface, flattened at each side, for articulation with the first phalanx ; it is broader, and extends farther forwards in front than behind, and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. On either side of the head is a deep depression, surmounted by a tubercle, for the attachment of the la.teral ligament of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The posterior surface, broad and flat, supports the Extensor tendons; the anterior surf ace presents a median groove, bounded on each side by a tubercle, for the passage of the Plexor tendons. Peculiar Characters of the Metacarpal Bones. The metacarpal hone of the thumb is shorter and wider than the rest, diverges to a greater degree from the carpus, and its palmar surface is directed inwards towards the palm. The shaft is flattened and broad on its dorsal aspect, and does not present the bifurcated ridge which is found on the other metacarpal bones ; it IS concave from before backwards on its palmar surface. The carpal extremity, or 6a.se, presents a concavo-convex surface, for articulation with the trapezium, and has no lateral facets. The digital extremity is less convex than that of the other meta- carpal bones, broader from side to side than from before backwards, and terminates antenorly m a small articular eminence on each side, over which play two sesamoid The side to which this bone belongs may be known by observing the little tacet, which IS marked on the inner side of its posterior surface just above the base, tor the tendon of the Extensor ossis motacarpi pollicis.

To the fifth, five: the Extensor carpi ulnaris, Flexor carpi ulnaris, Flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti, fourth Dorsal, and third Palmar interosseous. Phalanges. The Phalanges are the bones of the fingers ; they are fourteen in number, three for each finger, and two for the thumb. They are long bones, and present for examination a shaft, and two extremities. The shaft tapers from above downwards, is convex posteriorly, concave in front from above downwards, flat from side to side, and merked laterally by rough ridges, which give attachment to the fibrous sheaths of the Flexor tendons. The metacarpal extremity or hose, in the first row, presents an oval concave articular surface, broader from side to side than from before backwards; and the same extremity in the other two rows, a double con- cavity separated by a longitudinal median ridge, extending from before backwards. The digital extremities are smaller than the others, and terminate, in the first and second row, in two small lateral condyles, separated by a slight groove ; the arti- culai- surface being prolonged farther forwards on the palmar than on the dorsal surface, especially in the first row. The Ungual phalanries are convex on their dorsal, flat on their palmar surfaces- they are recognised by their small size, and by a roughened elevated surface of a horseshoe form on the palmar aspect of their ungual extremity, which serves to support the sensitive pulp of the finger.

The rough surface included between this line and the crest,affords attachment to part of the Gluteus maximus above, a few fibres of the Pyriformig below. The middle curved line, the longest of the three, commences at the crest, about an inch behind its anterior extremity, and, taking a curved direction down- wards and backwai-ds, terminates at the upper part of the gi-eat sacro-sciatic notch. The space between the middle and superior curved lines and the crest is concave, and affords attachment to the Gluteus medius muscle. Near the central part of this line may often be observed the orifice of a nutrient foramen. The inferior curved line, the least distinct of the three, commences in front at the upper part of the anterior inferior spinous process, and taking a curved direction backwards and downwards, terminates at the anterior part of the great sacro-sciatic notch. The surface of bone included between the middle and inferior curved lines is concave from above downwards, convex from before backwards, and affords attach- ment to the Gluteus minimus muscle. Beneath the inferior curved line, and cor- responding to the upper part of the acetabulum, is a smooth eminence (sometimes a depression), to which is attached, the reflected tendon of the Rectus femoris muscle. The Internal Surface (fig. 98) of the ilium is bounded above by the crest, below by a prominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, and before and behind by the anterior and posterior borders. It presents anteriorly a large smooth concave surface, called the internal iliac Jossa, or venter of the tlmm, which lodges the Iliacus rnuscle and presents at its lower part the orifice of a nutrient canal. Behind the iliac fossa is a rough surface, divided into two portions, a superior and an inferior. The inferior or auricular portion, so called from its resemblance in shape to the ear, is coated with cartilage in the recent state, and articulates with a similar shaped surface on the side of the sacrum. The superior portion is concave and rough, for the attachment of the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments. ^ The crest of the ilium is convex in its general outline and sinuously curved, - being bent inwards anteriorly, outwards posteriorly. It is longer in the female than in the male, very thick behind, and thinner at the centre than at the extre- mities. It terminates at either end in a prominent eminence, the anterior superior and posterior superior spinous process. The surface of the crest is broad and divided into an external lip, an internal lip, and an intermediate space To the external lip is attached the Tensor vaginjB femoris, Obliquus externus abdominis and Latissimus dorsi, and by its whole length the fascia lata; to the interspace between the lips, the Internal oblique; to the internal lip, the'Transversalis, yuadratus lumborum, and Erector spinsB, also the fascia iliaca The anterior border of the ihum is concave.

It is divisible mto a th.ck and solid portion, the body; the tuberosity, a largo roughii6 THE SKELETON. eminence, on which the body rests in sitting; and a thin ascending part, the rarans. The body, somewhat triangular in form, presents three surfaces, external, in- ternal, and posterior. The external surface corresponds to that portion of the acetabulum formed by the ischium ; it is smooth and concave above, and forms a little more than two-fifths of that cavity ; its outer margin is bounded by a pro- minent rim or lip, to which the cotyloid fibro-cartilage is attached. Below the acetabulum, between it and the tuberosity, is a deep gropve, along which the tendon of the Obturator externus muscle runs, as it passes outwards to be inserted into the dio-ital fossa of the femur. The internal surface is smooth, concave, and forms the lateral boundary of the true pelvic cavity ; it is broad above, and separated from the venter of the ilium by the linea ilio-pectinea, narrow below ; its posterior border is encroached upon, a little below its centre, by the spine of the ischium, above and below which are the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic notches; in front, it presents a sharp margin, which forms the outer boundary of the obturator foramen. This surface is perforated by two or three large vascular foramina, and affords attachment to part of the Obturator internus muscle. The posterior surface is quadrilateral in form, broad and smooth above, narrow below where it becomes continuous with the tuberosity; it is limited, in front, by the margin of the ace- tabulum ; behind, by the front part of the great sacro-sciatic notch. This surface supports the Pyriformis, the two Gemelli, and the Obturator internus muscles, in their passage outwards to the great trochanter. The body of the ischium presents three borders, posterior, inferior, and internal. The posterior border presents, a little below the centre, a thin and pointed triangular eminence, the spine of the ischium, more or less elongated in different subjects. Its external surface gives attachment to the Gemellus superior, its internal surface to the Coccygeus and Levator ani; whilst to the pointed extremity is connected the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. Above the spine is a notch of large size, the great sacro-sciatic, converted into a foramen by the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament; it transmits the Pyriformis muscle, the gluteal vessels, and superior gluteal nerve passing out of the pelvis above the muscle; the sciatic vessels, the greater and lesser sciatic nerves, the in- temal pudic vessels and nerve, and a small nerve to the Obtui-ator internus muscle below it. Below the spine is a smaller notch, the lesser sacro-sciatic ; it is smooth, coated in the recent state with cartilage, the surface of which presents numerous markings corresponding to the subdivisions of the tendon of the Obturator mternus which winds over it. It is converted into a foramen by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and transmits the tendon of the Obturator internus, the nerve which supplies that muscle, and the internal purlic vessels and nerve. The inferior border is thick and broad ;' at its point of junction with the posterior is the tuberosity of the ischium. The internal border is thin, and forms the outer circumference of the obturator foramen. . The tuberosity presents for examination an external lip, an mternal lip, and an intermediate space. The external lip gives attachment to the Quadratus femoris, and part of the Adductor magnus muscles. The inner lip is bounded by a sharp ridge for the attachment of a falciform prolongation of the great sacro-sciatic hga- ment- it presents a groove on the inner side of this for the lodgment of the internal pudic' vessels and nerve; and, more anteriorly, has attached the Transversus penuffii and Erector penis muscles. The intermediate surface presents four distmct impressions. Two of these, seen at the fi-ont part of the tuberosity, are rough, elongated, and separated from each other by a prominent ridge; the outer one gives attachment to the Adductor magnus, the inner one to the great sacro-sciatic ligament. Two, situated at the back part, are smooth, larger in size, and separated by an oblique ridge: from the upper and outer arises the Semi-mcmbranosus; from the lower and inner, the Biceps and Semi-tendinosus. The uppermost part of the tuberosity gives attachment to the Gemellus inferior. . The rw>nus, or ascending ramus, is the thin flattened part of the ischium, whicli iMcends from the tuberosity upwards and inwards, and joins the ramus of the pubc.OS INNOMINATUM. 117 —their point of junction being indicated in the adult by a rough eminence. The outer surface of the ramus is rough, for the attachment of the Obturator externus muscle, also some fibres of the Adductor magnus, and of the Gracilis; its inner surface forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. Its inner border is thick, rough, slightly everted, forms part of the outlet of the pelvis, and serves for the attachment of the crus penis. Its outer border is thin and sharp, and forms part of the inner margin of the obturator foramen. The P^^l)es forms the anterior part of the os innominatum; it is divisible into a horizontal ramus or body, and a perpendicular ramus. The body, or horizontal ramus, presents for examination two extremities, an outer and an inner, and four surfaces. The outer extremity, the thickest part of the bone, forms one-fifth of the cavity of the acetabulum ; it presents, above, a rough eminence), the ilio-pectineal, which serves to indicate the point of junction of the iHum and pubes. The inner extremity is the Symphysis; it is oval, covered by eight or nine transverse ridges, or a series of nipple-like processes arranged in rows, separated by grooves; they serve for the attachment of the connecting fibro-cartilage, placed between it and the opposite bone. The ujoper surface, triangular in form, wider externally than internally, is bounded behind by a sharp ridge, the pectineal line, or linea ilio-pectinea, which, running outwards, marks the brim of the true pelvis. The surface of bone in front of the pubic portion of the linea ilio-pectinea, serves for the attachment of the Pectineus muscle. This ridge terminates internally at a tubercle, which projects forwards, and is called the spine of the pubes. The portion of bone included between the spine and inner extre- mity of the pubes is called the crest; it serves for the attachment of the Rectus, Pyramidalis, and conjoined tendon of the Intei-nal oblique and Transversalis. The point of junction of the crest with the symphysis is called the a7igle of the puhes. The inferior surface presents, externally, a broad and deep oblique groove, for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve; and, internally, a sharp margin, which forms part of the circumference of the obturator foramen. Its external surface, flat and compressed, serves for the attachment of muscles. Its internal surface, convex from above downwards, concave from side to side, is smooth, and forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. ^ The descending ramihs of the pubes passes outwards and downwards, becoming thinner and narrower as it descends, and joins with the ramus of the ischium. Its external surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles ; the Adductor longus above, the Adductor brevis below ; the Gracilis along its inner border, the Com- pressor urethras towards its internal aspect; and a portion of the Obturator externus where it enters into the formation of the foramen of that name. Its inner surface IS smooth. Its inner border is thick, rough, and everted, especially in females. In the male it serves for the attachment of the crus penis. Its outer border forms pai-t of the circumference of the obturator foramen. The cotyloid cavity, or acetabulum, is a deep, cup-shaped, hemispherical de- pression ; formed, internally, by the pubes, above by the ilium, behind and below by the ischium; a little less than two-fifths being formed by the ilium, a little more than two-fifths by the ischium, and the remaining fifth by the pubes.

Development (fig. 99). By eicjU centres: three primary—one for the ilium, one for the ischium, and one for the pubes; and.^ve secondary—one for the crest of the ilium its whole length, one for the anterior inferior spinous process (said to occur more frequently in the male than the female), one for the tuberosity of the ischium, one for the symphysis pubis (more frequent in the female than the male), and one • for the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum. These various centres appear in the following order: First, in the ilium, at the lower part of the bone, immediately above the sciatic notch, at about the same period that the develop- ment of the vertebrae commences. Secondly, in the body of the ischium at about the third month of festal life. Thirdly, in the body of the pubes, bei weeu the fourth and fifth months. At birth, the three primary centres are quite separate the crest the bottom of tho acetabulum, and the rami of the ischium and pubes, bemg still cartilaginous. At about the sixth year, the rami of the pubes and ischium are almost completely ossified. About the thirteenth or fourteenth year the three divisions of the bone have extended their growth into the bottom of the acetabu- lum being separated from each other by a Y-shaped portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification. The ilium and ischium then become joined and lastly the pubes, through the intervention of this Y-shaped portion. At aboutPELVIS. 119 the age of puberty, ossiRcation takes place in each of the remaining portions, and they become joined to the rest of the bone about the twenty-fifth year. ArticulaUons.

The Pelvis, so called from its resemblance to a basin, is stronger and more massively constructed than either the cranial or thoracic cavity; it is a bony ring, interposed between the lower end of the spine, which it supports, and the lower extremities, upon which it rests. It is composed of four bones: the two ossa innominata, which bound it on. either side and in front; and the sacrum and coccyx, which complete it behind. The pelvis is divided by a prominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, into the false and true pelvis. The false pelvis is all that expanded portion of the pelvic cavity which is situated above the linea ilio-pectinea. It is bounded on each side by the ossa ilii • in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the spinous processes of the ilia on either side, which is filled up in the recent state by the parietes of the abdomen ; behind, in the middle line, is a deep notch. This broad shallow cavity is fitted to support the intestines, and to transmit part of their weight to the anterior wall of the abdomen. The true pelvis is all that part of the pelvic cavity which is situated beneath the linea iHo-pectinea. It is smaller than the false pelvis, but its walls are more perfect. For convenience of description, it is divided into a superior circum- ference or inlet, an inferior circumference or outlet, and a cavity. The superior circumference forms the margin or brim of the pelvis, the included space bemg called the inlet. It is formed by the linea ilio-pectinea, completed in front by the spue and crest of the pubes, and behind by the anterior margin of the base of the sacrum and sacro-vertebral ano-le. The inlet of the pelvis is somewhat heart-shaped, obtusely pointed in front divergmg on either side and encroached upon behind by the projection forwards of he promontory of the sacram. It has three principal diameters: antero- posterior (sacro-pubic), transverse, and obhque. The antero-posterior extends from the sacro-vertebral angle to the symphysis pubis; its average measurement w\rmrddie?f\: w^^^^^ — -4 .

The cavity is shallow in front, mea- suring at the symphysis an inch and a half in depth, three inches and a half m the middle, and four inches and a half posteriorly. From this description, it will be seen that the cavity of the pelvis is a short curved canal, considerably deeper on its posterior than on its anterior wall, and broader in the middle than at either joo —Male Pelvis (Adult). lOi.—Female Pelvis (Adult). extremity from the proejction forwards of the sacro-coccygeal column above andPELVIS. 121 I02.—Vertical Section of the Pelvis, with lines indicating the Axes of the Pelvis. beliind the symphysis pubis. In the female, the uterus and vagina occupy the interval between these parts. The loivei- circumference of the pelvis is very irregular, and forms what is called the outlet. It is bounded by three prominent eminences : one posterior, formed by the point of the coccyx; and one on each side, the tuberosities of the ischia. These eminences ai'e separated by three notches: one in front, the puhic arch, formed by the convergence of the rami of the ischia and pubes on each side. The other notches, one on each side, are formed by the sacrum and coccyx behind, the ischium in front, and the ilium above : they are called the sacro-sciatic notches ; in the natural state they are converted into foramina by the lesser and greater sacro-sciatic ligaments. The diameters of the outlet of the pelvis are two, antero-posterior and trans- verse. The antero-posterior extends from the tip of the coccyx to the lower part of the symphysis pubis, and the transverse from the posterior part of one ischiatic tuberosity to the same point on the opposite side: the average measurement of both is four inches. The antero-posterior diameter varies with the length of the coccyx, and is capable of increase or diminution, on account of the mobility of that bone. Position of the Pelvis. In the erect posture, the pelvis is placed obliquely with regard to the trunk of the body: the pelvic surface of the symphysis pubis looking up- wards and backwards, the con- cavity of the sacrum and coccyx looking downwards and forwards ; the base of the sacrum in well- formed female bodies, being nearly four inches above the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx a little more than half an inch above its lower border.

V Surface. at the outer side of the neck, at its junction with the upper part of the shaft. It is directed a little outwards and backwards, and, in the adult, is about three quarters of an inch lower than the head. It presents for examination two surfaces, and four borders. The external surface, quadrilateral in form, is broad, rough, convex, and marked by a prominent diagonal line, which extends from the posterior superior to the anterior inferior angle : this line serves for the attachment of the tendon of the Gluteus medius. Above the line is a triangular surface, sometimes rough for part of the tendon of the same muscle, sometimes smooth for the interposition of a bursa between that tendon and the bone. Below and be- hind the diagonal line is a smooth tri- angular surface over which the tendon of the Gluteus maximus muscle plays, a bursa being interposed. The internal mr- face is of much less extent than the external, and presents at its base a deep depression, the digital or trochanteric fossa for the attachment of the tendon of the Obturator externus muscle. The superior border is free; it is thick and irregular, and marked by impressions for the attachment of the Pyiiformis behind, the Obturator internus and Gemelli in front. The inferior border corresponds to the point of junction of the base of the trochanter with the outer surface of the shaft; it is rough, prominent, slightly curved, and gives attachment to the upper part of the Vastus externus muscle. The anterior border is prominent, some- what irregular, as well as the surface of bone immediately below it; it affords attachment by its outer part to the Gluteus minimus. The posterior border IS very prominent, and appears as a free rounded edge, which forms the back part of the digital fossa. The Lesser Trochanter is a conical eminence, which varies in size in different subjects ; it projects from the lower and back part of the base of the neck. Its base IS triangular, and connected with the adjacent parts of the bono by tliree well- marked borders : two of these are above —the internal continuous with the lower border of the neck; the ewtcmal with tlio posterior intertrochanteric line, while the^ THE SKELETON. 11 ^,-rirllfi flivision of the linea aspera.

The anterior surface includes that por- tion of the shaft which is situated between the two lateral borders. It is smooth convex, broader above and below than in the centre, slightly twisted, so that its upper part is directed forwards and a little outwards, its lower part forwards and a little inwards. To the upper three- fourths of this surface the Crureus is attached ; the lower fourth is separated from the muscle by the intervention of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, and affords attachment to' the Subcrureus to a small extent. The external surface includes the portion of bone between the external border and the outer lip of the linea aspera ; it is continuous above, with the outer surface o£ the great trochanter ; below with the outer surface of the ex- ternal condyle : to its upper three-fourths is attached the outer portion of the Crureus muscle. The internal swface includes the portion of bone between the internal border and the inner lip of the linea aspera; it is continuous, above, with the lower border of the neck ; below, with the inner side of the internal con- dyle : it is covered by the Vastus intemus muscle. The Lower Extremity, larger than the upper, is of a cuboid form, flattened from before backwards, and divided into two large eminences, the condyles (kovSvXoc, (t hnucJcle), by an interval which presents a smooth depression in front called the trochlea, and a notch of considerable size behind —the intercondyloid notch. The external condyle is the more pro- minent anteriorly, and is the broader both in the antero-posterior and trans- verse diameters.

Articulations. With three bones : the os innominatum, tibia, and patella. Development (fig. 106). The femur is developed by five centres : one for the shaft, one for each ex- tremity, and one for each trochanter. Of all the long bones, except the clavicle, it is the first to show traces of ossification ; this commences in the shaft, at about the fifth week of foetal life, the centres of ossifica- tion in the epiphyses appearing in the following order: First, in the lower end of the bone, at the ninth month of festal life ; from this the condyles and tuberosities are formed ; in the head, at the end of the first year after birth; in the great trochanter, during the fourth year; and in the lesser trochanter, between the thirteenth and four- teenth. The order in which the epiphyses are joined to the shaft, is the reverse of that of their appear- ance ; their junction does not com- mence until after puberty, the lesser trochanter being fii-st joined, then the greater, then the head, and, lastly, the inferior extremity (the first in which ossification com- menced), which is not united until . the twentieth year.

The Uijifer Extremity, or head, is large and expanded on each side into two lateral eminences, «the tuberosities. Superiorly, the 'tuberosities present two smooth concave surfaces, which aiiiiculate with the condyles of the femur; the internal articular surface is longer than the external, and oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle ; the external one being broader, flatter, and more circular, to articulate with the external condyle. Between the two articular sur- faces, and nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is an eminence, the spinous process of the tibia, surmounted by a prominent tubercle on each side, which gives attachment to the extremities of the semilunar fibro-cartilages; in _front and behind the spinous process is a rough depression for the attach- ment of the anterior and pos- terior crucial ligaments and the semilunar cartilages. The an- terior surfaces of the tuberosities are continuous with one another, forming a single large surface, which is somewhat flattened : it is triangiilar, broad above, and perforated by large vascular foramina, narrow below, where it terminates in a jarominent oblong elevation of large size, the tubercle of the tibia; the lower half of this tubercle is rough, for the attachment of the ligameutum patella); the upper half is a smooth facet corre- sponding, in the recent state, with a bursa which separates the ligament from the bone. Posteriorly, the tuberosities are separated from each other by a shallow depression, tlie popliteal notch, which gives attachment to the posterior crucial ligament. The posterior surface of the inner tuberosity presents a deep130 THE SKELETON. transverse groove, for tlie inser- tion of the tendon of tlie Semi- membranosus ; and tlio posterior surface of tlic outer one, a flat articular facet, nearly circular in form, directed downwards, back- wards, and outwards, for arti- culation with the fibula. The lateral surfaces are convex and rough: the internal one, the most prominent, gives attach- ment to the internal lateral liga- ment. The Sliaft of the tibia is of a triangular prismoid form, broad above, gradually decreasing in size to the commencement of its lower fourth, its most slender part where fracture most fre- quently occurs ; it then enlarges again towards its lower extre- mity. It presents for examina- tion three surfaces and three borders. The anterior border, the most prominent of the three, is called the crest of the tibia, or, in popular language, the shin; it commences above at the tubercle, and terminates below at the anterior margin of the inner malleolus. This border is very prominent in the upper two- thirds of its extent, smooth and rounded below. It presents a very flexuous course, being curved outwards above, and in- wards below; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg. The internal hordes- is smooth and rounded above and below, but more prominent in the centre; it commences at the back part of the inner tuberosity, and terminates at the posterior border of the internal malleolus ; its upper part gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee to the extent of about two inches, and to some fibres of the Popliteus muscle; its middle third, to some fibres of the Soleus and Flexor longus digitorum muscles. The external border, or inter- osseous ridge, is thin and pro- minent, especially its central 11 o.—Bones of the Right Leg. Posterior Surface. '7«iJproeen ri I U LATIBIA. K 2 part, and gives attacliment to tlie interosseous membrane; it commences above in front of the fibular articular facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament, connecting the tibia and fibula. The internal surface is smooth, convex, and broader above than below; its upper third, directed forwards and inwards, is covered by the aponeurosis derived from the tendon of the Sartorius, and by the tendons of the Gracihs and Semi- tendinosus, all of which are inserted nearly as far forwards as the anterior border; in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous. The external surface is naiTower than the intei'ual; its upper two-thirds present a shallow groove for the attachment of the Tibialis anticus muscle; its lower third is smooth, convex, curves gradually forwards to the anterior part of the bone, and is covered from within outwards by the tendons of the following muscles : Tibialis anticus. Extensor proprius poUicis, Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius. The posterior stirface (fig. iiq) presents, at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the oblique line of the tibia, which extends from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula, obliquely downwards, to the internal border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. It marks the limit for the insertion of the PopHteus muscle, and serves for the attachment of the popliteal fascia, and part of the Soleus, Flexor longus digitorum, and Tibialis posticus muscles; the triangular concave surface, above and to the inner side of this line, gives attachment to the Popliteus muscle. The middle third of the posterior surface is divided by a vertical ridge into two lateral halves : the ridge is well marked at its commence- ment at the oblique line, but becomes gradually indistinct below : the inner and broader half gives attachment to the Plexor longus digitorum, the outer and narrower to part of the Tibialis posticus. The remaining part of the bone is covered by the Tibialis posticus, Plexor longus digitorum, and Flexor longns polKcis muscles. Immediately below the obhque hne is the medullary foramen, which is directed obliquely downwards. The Lotuer Extremity, much smaller than the upper, presents five surfaces; it IS prolonged downwards, on its inner side, into a strong process, the internal malleolus. The inferior surface of the bone is quadrilateral, and^smooth, for articu- lation with the astragalus. This surface is narrow internally, where it becomes continuous with the articular surface of the inner malleolus, broader externally, and traversed from before backwards by a shght elevation, separating two lateral depressions. The anterior surface of the lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor muscles of the toes ; its lower margin presents a rough transverse depression, for the attachment of the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint: the posterior su,rface presents a superficial groove directed obliquely downwards and inwards, continuous with a similar groove on the posterior extremity of the astragalus, and serving for the passage of the tendon ot tne flexor longus pollicis: the external surface presents a triangular rough depression for the attachment of the inferior interosseous ligament connecting it with the fibula; the lower part of this depression is smooth in some bones, covered with cartilage m the recent state, and articulating with the fibula.

Like that of the other long bones. Development. By three centres (fig. iii) : one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the same time as in the femur, the fifth week, and gradually extends towards either ex tremity. The centre for the upper epiphysis appears at birth ; it is flat- tened in form, and has a thin tongue- shaped process in front, which forms the tubercle. That for the lower epiphysis appears in the second year. The lower epiphysis joins the shaft at about the twentieth year, and the upper one about the twenty-fifth year. Two additional centres occa- sionally exist, one for the tongue- shaped process of the upper epiphysis, the tubercle, and one for the inner malleolus. Articulations. With three bones: the femur, fibula, and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles. To the inner tuberosity, the Semimembra- nosus: to the outer tuberosity, the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum: to the shaft, its internal surface, the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semitendinosus; to its external sur- face, the Tibialis anticus ; to its poste i- i I.—rian of the Developnieut of the Tibia.

The Eibula. (Figs. 109, no.) The Fibula is situated at the outer side of the leg. It is the smaller of the two bones, and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones ; it is placed nearly parallel with the tibia. Its upper extremity is small, placed below the level of the knee-joint, and excluded from its formation; the lower extremity inclines a little forwards, so as to be on a plane anterior to that ot the upper end, projects below the tibia, and forms the outer ankle. It presents tor examination a shaft and two extremities. The TJpver Bxtremity, or Bead, is of an irregular rounded form, presentmg above a flattened articular facet, directed upwards and inwards, for articulation with a corresponding facet on the external tuberosity of the tibia._ On the outer side is a thick and rough prominence, continued behind into a pointed eminence, the styloid process, which projects upwards fi-om the P0«^«-^°^" ;f ^^^"^^X The prominence gives attachment to the tendon of the Biceps ---1^'to th^ long external lateral ligament of the knee, the hgament dmdmg t^^^ two parts.

Its external s^^fa^e is convex, subcutaneous, and continuous ^^w^^ ^angular (also subcutaneous) surface on the outer side of the shaft. The internaFIBULA. 133 mrfaco presents in fi-ont a smooth triangular facet, broader above tlian below, and convex from above downwards, which articulates with a corresponding surface on the outer side of the astragalus. Behind and beneath the articular surface is a rough depression, which gives attachment to the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle. The anterior harder is thick and rough, and marked below by a depression for the attachment of the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. The posterior border is broad and marked by a shallow groove, for the passage of the tendons of the Peroneus longus and brevis muscles. The mmmit is rounded, and srives attachment to the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. The Shaft presents three surfaces and three borders. The anterior harder com- mences above in front of the head, runs vertically downwards to a little below the middle of the bone, and then, curving a little outwards, bifurcates below. The two lines so formed bound the triangular subcutaneous surface immediately abave the outer side of the external malleolus. This border gives attachment tO' &ia inter- muscular septum, which separates the muscles on the anterior surface from those on the external. The internal hoo-der, or interosseous ridge, is situated close to the inner side of the preceding, and runs nearly parallel with it in the upper third of its extent, but diverges from it so as to include a broader space in the lower two-thirds. It commences above just beneath the head of the bone (sometimes it is quite indistinct for about an inch below the head), and terminates below at the apex of a rough triangular surface immediately above the articular facet of the external malleolus It serves for the attachment of the interosseous membrane, and separates the extensor muscles in front from the flexor muscles behind. The portion of bone included between the anterior and interosseous lines forms the anterior surface. The posterior harder is sharp and prominent; it commences above at the base of the styloid process, and terminates below in the posterior border of the outer malleo- lus. It is directed outwards above, backwards in the middle of its course, back- wards and a little inwards below, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the muscles on the outer from those on the inner sui-face of the shaft. The portion of bone included between this line and the interosseous ridge, and which includes more than half of the whole circumference of the fibula, is known as the internal surface. Its upper three-fourths, are subdivided into two parts, an an- terior and a posterior, by a very prominent ridge, the oblique- line of the fibula, which commences above at the inner side of the head, and' terminates by becomincr con- tmuous with the luterosseous ridge at the lower'fourth of the bone. The oblique Ime attaches an aponeurosis which separates the Tibialis posticus from the Soleus above, and the Flexor longus poUicis below. This line sometimes ceases just before approaching the interosseous ridge. _ The anteri^or surface is the interval between the anterior and interosseous borders. It IS extremely narrow and flat in the upper third of its extent; broader and grooved ongitudmally in Its lower third; it serves for the attachment of three Suscles, the Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, and Extensor proprius pollicis The eMernal surface, much broader than the preceding, and often deeply grooved, IS directed outwards in thp mir,^»T.^ 4.1,- J r -x 1 1 ^'^^i'^J fi 1 J 1. m tne upper two-thirds of its course, backwards in Inl TV 7 " P°«t^"°r border of the external muscles " °«°^P-'i ^y the Peroneus longus and bre4 w?'

Development. By three centres (fig. 112): one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft about the sixth week of foetal life, a little later than in the tibia, and extends gradually towards the ex- tremities. At birth both ends are cartilaginous. Ossification commences in the lower end in the second year, and in the upper one about the fourth year. The lower epiphysis, the first in which ossification commences, becomes united to the shaft first, contrary to the law which appears to prevail with regard to the junction of the epiphyses with the shaft: this takes place about the twentieth year ; the upper epi- physis is joined about the twenty-fifth year.* Attachment of Muscles. To the head, the Biceps, Soleus, and Peroneus longus : to the shaft, its anterior surface, the Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, and Extensor proprius pollicis ; to the internal surface, the Soleus, Tibialis posticus, and Flexor longus poUicis: to the external surface, the Peroneus longus and brevis. THE FOOT. (Pigs. 113, 114-) The skeleton of the Foot consists of three divisions : the Tarsus, Metatarsus, and Phalanges. Th. Tabsus. The bones of the Tarsus are seven in number: viz., the calcaneum, or os calcis, astragalus, cuboid, ^scaphoid, internal, middle, and external cuneiform bones. The Calcaneum. The Galcanemi, or Os Galois, is the largest and strongest of the tarsal bones. It is irregularly cuboidal in form, and situated at the lower and back part ot the foot, serving to transmit the weight of the body to the ground, and forming a strong lever for the muscles of the calf. It presents for examination six surfaces : supe- rior, inferior, external, internal, anterior, and posterior. , . , . f The suverior swrface is formed behind, of the upper aspect of that part oi the OS calcis which projects backwards to form the heel. It varies m length in difi-erent individuals ; is convex from side to side, concave from before back- wards, and corresponds above to a mass of adipose substance placed in front o the tendo Achillis.

Of the two articular surfaces, the external is the larger, and situated on the body of the bone : it is of an oblong form, wider behind than in front, and convex from before backwards The " intm-^ial articular sur/aco is supported on a projecting process of bone, called the lesser process of the calcaneum (sustentaculum tali) ; it is a so oblong, concave longitudinally, and sometimes subdivided into two parts, which differ m si.e and shape.

The rough surface in front of the tubercles gives attach- ment to the long plantar ligament, and to the outer head of the Elexor accessonus muscle • and to a prominent tubercle nearer the anterior part of the bone, as well as to a transverse groove in front of it, is attached the short plantar hgament. The external surface is broad, flat, and almost subcutaneous; it presents near its centre a tubercle, for the attachment of the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. Above the tubercle is abroad smooth surface, giving attach- ment, at its upper and anterior part, to the external calcaneo-astraga oid hgament; and in front of the tubercle a narrow surface marked by two obhque grooves, separated by an elevated ridge: the s^^perior groove transmits the tendon ot the Peioneus brevis ; the inferior, the tendon of the Peroneus longus ; the mtervemng ridge gives attachment to a prolongation from the external annular ligament. The internal surface presents a deep concavity, chrected obliquely ^ownwaris and forwards, for the transmission of the plantar vessels and nerves and Flexor tendons Lo the sole of the foot; it affords attachment to part of the Flexor accessorius muscle. This surface presents an eminence of bone, the lesser process, wS projects horizontally inwards from its upper and fore part, and to which a X of tL' tendon of the Tibialis posticus is attached This process xs concave above and supports the interior articular surface of the astragalus ; below, it is convex^and grooved for the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis.

It presents for examination six surfaces: three articular and three non-articular. The noii-ai-ticular surfaces are the superior, inferioi-, and external. The supei-ior or dorsal surface, directed upwards and outwards, is rough, for the ■ attachment of numerous ligaments. The inferior or plantar surface presents in front a deep groove, which runs obliquely from without, forwards and inwards ; it lodges the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and is bounded behind by a promi- nent ridge, terminating extei-nally in an eminence, the tuberosity of the cuboid, the surface of which presents a convex facet, for articulation with the sesamoid bone of the tendon contained in the groove. The ridge and surface of bone behind it are rough, for the attachment of the long and short plantar ligaments. A few fibres of the Flexor brevis poUicis may be traced to this surface. The external surface, the smallest and narrowest of the three, presents a deep notch formed by the commencement of the peroneal groove. The articular surfaces are the posterior, anterior, and internal. The posterior sv/rface is smooth, triangular, concavo-convex, for articulation with the anterior surface of the os calcis. The anterior, of smaller size, but also irregularly trian- gular, is divided by a vertical ridge into two facets : the inner facet, quadrilateral in form, articulates with the fourth metatarsal bone ; the outer one, larger and more triangular, articulates with the fifth metatarsal. The internal surface is broad, rough, irregularly quadrilateral, presenting at its middle and upper part a small oval facet, for articulation with the external cuneiform bone; and behind this (occasionally) a smaller facet, for articulation with the scaphoid'; it is rouo-h in the rest of its extent, for the attachment of strong interosseous ligaments. * To ascertain to which foot it belongs, hold the bone so that its under surface marked by the peroneal groove, looks downwards, and the large concavo-convex articular surface backwards, towards the holder : the narrow non-articular surface marked by the commencement of the peroneal groove, will point to the side to which the bone belongs.

It is distinguished from the internal cuneiform bone by its more regular wedge-Uke shape, and by the absence of the kidney-shaped articular surface: from the middle cuneiform, by the absence of the bent, or angular, facet, and by the two articular facets which mark both its inner and outer surfaces. It has six surfaces for examination. Theanteiior surface, triangular in form, articulates with the third metatarsal bone. The posterior surface articulates with the most external facet of the scaphoid, and is rough below for the attachment of hgamentous fibres. The internal surface presents two articular facets, separated by a rough depression ; the anterior one, situated at the superior angle of the bone, articulates with the outer side of the base of the second metatarsal bone ; the posterior one skirts the posterior border, and articulates with the middle cuneiform ; the rough depression between the two gives attachment to an interosseous ligament. The external surface also presents two articular facets, separated by a rough non-articular surface ; the anterior facet, situated at the superior angle of the bone, is small, and articulates with the inner side of the base of the fourth metatarsal; the posterior, and larger one articulates with the cuboid; the rough non-articular surface serves for the attachment of an interosseus hgaraent. The three facets for articulation with the three metatarsal bones are continuous with one another, and covered by a prolongation of the same cartilage ; the facets for articulation with the middle cuneiform and scaphoid are also continuous, but that for articulation with the cuboid is usually separate. The svperior or dorsal siorface, of an oblong form, is rough for the attachment of liga- ments. The inferior or plantar surface is an obtuse rounded margin, and serves for the attachment of part of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, part of the Flexor brevis pollicis, and ligaments. To ascertain to which side it belongs, hold the bone with the broad dorsal surface upwards, the prolonged edge backwards; the separate articular facet for the cuboid will point to the proper side.

This bono is known by tbe single Iddnoy-sbaped articular surface on its base; the deeply grooved appearance of the plantar surface of its head ; and its great thickness, relatively to its length. When it is placed in its natural position, the concave border of the kidney-shaped articular sui-face on its base points to the side to which the bone belongs. The Secmd is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones, being , prolono-od backwards into the recess formed between the three cuneiform bones. Its ta'>°al extremity is broad above, narrow and rough below. It presents four arti- cular surfaces: one behind, of a triangular form, for articulation with the middle cuneiform : one at the upper part of its internal lateral surface, for articulation with the internal cuneiform ; and two on its external lateral surface, a superior and an inferior, separated by a rough depression. Each of the latter articular sui-faces is divided by a vertical ridge into two parts; the anterior segment of each facet articulates with the third metatarsal; the two posterior (sometimes continuous) with the external cuneiform. The facets on the tarsal extremity of the second metatarsal bone serve at once to distinguish it from the rest and to indicate the foot to which it belongs ; there being one facet at the upper angle of the internal surface, and two facets, each subdivided into two parts, on the external surface, pointing to the side to which the bone belongs. The fact that the two posterior subdivisions of these external facets sometimes run into one should not be forgotten. The Thi/rd articulates behind, by means of a triangular smooth surface, with the external cuneiform ; on its inner side, by two facets, with the second metatarsal; and on its outer side, by a single facet, with the third metatarsal. The latter facet is of circular form, and situated at the upper angle of the base. The third metatarsal is known by its having at its tarsal end two undivided facets on the inner side, and a single facet on the outer. This distmgmshes it from the second metatarsal, in which the two facets, found on one side of its tarsal end, are each subdivided into two. The single facet (when the bone is put in its natural position) is on the side to which the bone belongs. The Fourth is smaller in size than the preceding; its tarsal extremity presents a terminal quadrilateral surface, for ari;iculation with the cuboid ; a smooth facet on the inner side, divided bv a ridge into an anterior portion for ariiculation with the third metatarsal, and a posterior pori^ion for articulation with the external cunei- form • on the outer side a single facet, for articulation with the fifth metatarsal. The fourth metatarsal is known by its having a single fax^et, on either side ot the tarsal extremity, that on the inner side being divided into two parts. It tins subdivision be not recognisable, the fact that its tarsal end is bent somewhat out^ wards will indicate the side to which it belongs, as Mr. Holden points out. The Fifth is recognised by the tubercular eminence on the outer side of its base. It articulates behind, by a triangular surface cut obHquely from without inwards, with the cuboid : and internally, with the fourth metatarsal. The projection on the outer side of this bone at its tarsal end at once distin- miishes it from the others, and points to the side to which it belongs. Articulations. Each bone articulates with the tarsal bones by one extremity, and by t^o otler with the first row of phalanges. The number of tarsal bones with which each metatarsal articulates, is one for the first, three for the .second, one for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the fifth Attaciment of Muscles. To the first metatarsal bone, three: paxt^of the Tii,,ah._ anticus, the Peroneus longus, and Eirst dorsal nterosseous.

The Phalanges of the foot, both in number and general arrangement, resemble those in the hand ; there being two in the great toe, and three in each of the other toes. The phalanges of the first roio resemble closely those of the hand. The shaft is compressed from side to side, convex above, concave below. The posterior extremiUj is concave; and the anterior extremity presents a trochlear surface, for articulation with the second phalanges. The phalanges of the second row are remarkably small and short, but rather broader than those of the first row. The tW(7MaZ phalanges, in form, resemble. those of the fingers ; but they are smaller, flattened from above downwards, presenting a broad base for articulation with the second row, and an expanded extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe.

LThe Articulations. THE various bones of wliicli the Skoleton. consists, are connected together at different parts of tlieir surfaces, and such a connection is designated by tlie name of Joint or Articulation. If tbe joint is immoveaUe, as between the cranial and most of the facial bones, their adjacent margins are applied in almost close contact a thin layer of fibrous membrane, the sutural ligament, and, at the base of the skull, in certain situations, a thin layer of cartilage being interposed. Where slight movement is rcquii-ed, combined with great strength, the osseous surfaces are united by tough and elastic fibro-cartilages, as in the joints of the spine, the sacro-ihac, and interpubic articulations; but in the moveable joints, the bones forming the articulation are generally expanded for greater convenience of mutual connection, covered by cartilage, held together by strong bands or capsules of fibrous tissue, called ligaments, and lined by a membrane, the synovial membrane, which secretes a fluid to lubricate the various parts of which the joint is formed: so that the structures which enter into tlie formation of a joint are bone, cartilage, fibro-cartilage, ligament, and synovial membrane. Bone constitutes the fundamental element of all the joints. In the long bones, the extremities are the parts which form the articulations; they are generally somewhat enlarged, consisting of spongy cancellous tissue, with a thin coating of compact substance. In the flat bones, the articulations usually take place at the edges; and, in the short bones, at various parts of their surface. The layer of compact bone which forms the articular surface, and to which the cartilage is attached, is called the articular lamella. It is of a white colour, extremely dense, and varies in thickness. Its structure differs from ordinary bone tissue in this respect, that it contains no Haversian canals, and its lacunsB are much larger than in ordinary bone, and have no canaliculi. The vessels of the cancellous tissue, as they approach the articular lamella, turn back in loops, and do not perforate it; this layer is consequently more dense and firmer than ordinaiy bone, and is evidently designed to form a firm and unyielding support for the articular cartilage. i <. -i • The articular will be found described along with the other kmds of cartilage m the Introduction. • . n Ligaments are found in nearly all the moveable articulations; they consist ot bands of various forms, serving to connect together the articular extremities of bones, and composed mainly of bundles of white fibrous tissue placed parallel vnth, or closely interlaced with, one another, and presenting a white, shining silvery aspect Ligament is pHant and flexible, so as to allow of the most perfect fi-eedom of movement, but strong, tough, and inextensile, so as not readily to yield under the most severely appUed force ; it is consequently well adapted to serve as the connecting medium between the bones. Some ligaments consist entirely of yellow elastic tissue, as the ligamenta subflava, which connect together the adjacent arches of the vertebrce, and the ligamentum nucha?. In these cases, it will be observed that the elasticity of the ligament is intended to act as a substitute for muscular ^^^^^ynomal Membrane is a thin, delicate membrane, arranged in the form of a short wide tube, attached by its open ends to the margins of the articular extremities ot the bones, and covering the inner surface of the various ligaments which connect the articulating surfaces. It resembles the serous membranes in structure, but differs in the nature of its secretion, which is thick, viscid, and glairy, like t i white of egg ; and hence termed synovia. The synovial membi-aucs found m ili body admit of subdivision into three kinds, articular, bursal, and vaginal The articular synovial membranes are found in all the freely moveable joints In the foetus, this membrane is said, by Toynbeo, to be continued over the suriac of the cartilages ; but in the adult it is wanting, excepting at their circumference, upon which it encroaches for a short distance : it then invests the inner surface otSTRUCTUEE OF JOINTS. 147 the capsular or otlier ligaments enclosing the joint, and is reflected over the sui'faco of any tendons passing through its cavity, as the tendon of the Poplitcus in the knee, and the tendon of the Biceps in the slioulder. In most of the joints, the synovial membrane is thi'own into folds, which project into the cavity. Some of these folds contain lai'ge masses of fat. These are especially distinct in the hip and the knee. Others ai-e flattened folds, subdivided at their margins into fringe-like processes, the vessels of which have a convoluted arrangement. The latter generally project from the synovial membrane near the margin of the cartilage, and lie flat upon its surface. They consist of connective tissue, covered "with epithelium, and contain fat cells in variable quantity, and, more rarely, isolated cartilage cells. They are found in most of the bui-sal and vaginal, as ■weU as in the articular synovial membranes, and were described, by Clopton Havers, as mucilaginous glands, and as the source of the synovial secretion. Under certain diseased conditions, similar processes are found covering the entire surface of the synovial membrane, forming a mass of pedunculated fibro-fatty growths, which project into the joint. The Iwsce are found interposed between surfaces which move upon each other, producing friction, as in the gliding of a tendon, or of the integument over pro- jecting bony surfaces. They admit of subdivision into two kinds, the lursce mucosce, ^ and the stjnovial Uirsm. The former are large, simple, or irregular cavities in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, enclosing a clear viscid fluid. They are found in various situations, as between the integument and front of the patella, over the olecranon, the malleoh, and other prominent parts. The synovial hursce are found interposed between muscles or tendons as they play over projectino- bony surfaces, as between the Glutei muscles and surface of the great trochanter They consist of a thin wall of connective tissue, partially covered by epithelium" and contain a viscid fluid. Where one of these exists in the neighbourhood of a joint, it usually communicates with its cavity, as is generally the case with the bm-sa between the tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus and the capsular Hc^ament of the hip, or the one interposed between the under surface of the Subscapularis and the neck of the scapula. The vaginal synovial memhranes (synovial sheaths) serve to facilitate the ghdmg of tendons in the osseo-fibrous canals through which they pass The membrane is here arranged in the form of a sheath, one layer of which adheres to the wall of the canal, and the other is reflected upon the outer surface of the con- llll fl^'?,' *^!JP^°^ two free surfaces of the membrane being tClf/o? h r '^T'^- '^^"^^^ f^^^d surrounding th!

The s^ltura dentala (dens, a tooth) is so called from the tooth-like form of the projecting articular processes, as in the suture between the parietal bones. In the suiura serrata {serra, a saw), the edges of the two bones forming the articulation are serrated like the teeth of a fine saw, as between the two portions of the frontal bone. In the sutura Ihnbosa (limhus, a selvage), besides the dentated processes, there is a certain degree of bevelling of the articular surfaces, so that the bones overlap one another, as in the suture between the parietal and frontal bones. When the articulation is formed by roughened surfaces placed in apposition with one another, it is termed the/aZse suture, sutura notha, of which there are two kinds: the sutura squamosa (squama, a scale), formed by the overlapping of two con- tiguous bones by broad bevelled margins, as in the temporo-parietal (squamous) suture ; and the sutura Jiarmonia (apfxovia, ajoinvng together), where there is simple apposition of two contiguous rough bony surfaces, as in the articulation between the two superior maxillary bones, or of the horizontal plates of the palate bones. Schindylesis (ax^rdvXrjenQ, a fissure) is that form of articulation in which a thin plate of bone is received into a cleft or fissure formed by the separation of two laminae of another, as in the articulation of the rostrum of the sphenoid, and per- pendicular plate of the ethmoid with the vomer, or in the reception of the latter in the fissure between the superior maxillary and palate bones. Gomphosis (yo'/i^oe, a nail) is an articulation formed by the insertion of a conical process into a socket, as a nail is driven into a board ; this is not illustrated by any articulations between bones, properly so called, but is seen in the articula- tion of the teeth with the alveoli of the maxillary bones. 2. Amphiarthrosis. Mixed Articulations. In this foiTU of articulation, the contiguous osseous surfaces are either con- nected together by broad flattened discs of fibro-cartilage, which adhere to the end of both bones, as in the articulation between the bodies of the vertebrae, or that between the first two pieces of the sternum ; or else the articulating surfaces are covered with fibro-cartilage, partially lined by synovial membrane, and con- nected together by external ligaments, as in the sacro-iliac and pubic symphyses ; both these forms being capable of limited motion in every direction. The former resemble the synarthrodial joints in the continuity of their surfaces, and absence of synovial sac; the latter, the diarthrodial. These joints occasionally become obhterated in old age; as is frequently the case in the pubic articulation, and occasionally in the intervertebral and sacro-iliac. 3. DiARTHROSis. Moveable Articulations. This form of articulation includes the greater number of the joints in the body, mobility being their distinguishing character. They are formed by the approxi- mation of two contiguous bony surfaces, covered with cartilage, connected by ligaments, and lined by synovial njembrane. The varieties of joints in this class < have been determined by the kind of motion permitted in each ; they are four m 1 number: Arthrodia, Enarthrosis, Ginglymus, Diarthrosis rotatorius. Arthrodia is that form of joint which admits of a gliding movement; it is ^ formed by the approximation of plane surfaces, or one slightly concave, the other' slightly convex; the amount of motion between them being limited by the ligar- ments, or osseous processes, surrounding the articulation; as in the articular pro- cesses of the vertebras, temporo-maxillary, stcrno- and acromio-clavicular, inferior radio-ulnar, carpal, carpo-metacarpal, superior tibio-fibular, tarsal, and tarso-meta--I tarsal articulations. Enarthrosis is that form of joint which is capable of motion m all direction?. It is formed by the reception of a globular head into a deep cup-like cavity (hencr the name ' ball and socket'), the parts being kept in apposition by a capsular hga--STRUCTURE OF JOINTS. 149 ment strengthened by accessory ligameutous bands. Examples of this form of articulation are found in the hip and shoulder. Ginglymus, Einge-joint (yiyyXv^of, a hinge). In this form of joint, the arti- cular surfaces are moulded to each other in such a manner, as to permit motion only in two directions, forwards and backwards, the extent of motion at the same time being considerable. The articular surfaces are connected together by strong lateral ligaments, which form their chief bond of union. The most perfect forms of ginglymus are the elbow and ankle ; the knee is less pei-fect, as it allows a slight degi-ee of rotation in certain positions of the limb : there are also the metatarso- phalangeal and phalangeal joints in the lower extremity, and the metacarpo- phalangeal and phalangeal joints in the upper extremity. Diarthrosis rotatorms (Lateral Ginglymus). Where the movement is limited to rotation, the joint is formed by a pivot-hke process turning within a ring, or the ring on the pivot, the ring being formed partly of bone, partly of ligament. In the articulation of the odontoid process of the axis with the atlas, the ring is formed in front by the anterior arch of the atlas ; behind, by the transverse ligament; here the ring rotates round the odontoid process. In the superior radio-ulnar articula- tion, the ring is formed partly by the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna; in the rest of its extent, by the orbicular ligament; here, the head of the radius rotates within the ring. Subjoined, in a tabular form, are the names, distinctive characters, and examples of the different kinds of articulations. Synarthrosis, or Immoveable Joint.

The Kinds of Movement admitted in Joints. The movements admissible in joints may be divided into four kinds : ghding, angular movement, circumduction, and rotation. Gliding movement is the most simple kind of motion that can take place in a joint, one surface gliding over another. It is common to all moveable joints ; but in some, as in the articulations of the carpus and tarsus, it is the only motion permitted. This movement is not confined to plane surfaces, but may exist between any two contiguous surfaces, of whatever form, limited by the ligaments which enclose the articulation. Angular movement occurs only between the long bones, and may take place in four directions, forwards and backwards, constituting flexion and extension, or in- wards and outwards, constituting adduction and abduction. The strictly gingly- moid or hinge joints admit of flexion and extension only. Abduction and adduction, combined with flexion and extension, are met with in the more moveable jomts; as in the hip, shoulder, and metacarpal joint of the thumb, and partially in the wrist and ankle. Circumduction is that limited degree of motion which takes place between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, whilst the extremity and sides of the limb are made to circumscribe a conical space, the base of which corresponds with the inferior extremity of the limb, the apex with the articular cavity; this kind of motion is best seen in the shoulder and hip joints. Rotation is the movement of a bone upon its own axis, the bone retaining the same relative situation with respect to the adjacent parts ; as in the articulation between the atlas and axis, where the odontoid process serves as a pivot around which the atlas turns; or in the rotation of the. radius upon the humerus, and also in the hip and shoulder. The actions of the different joints of a limb are combined by means of the long muscles which pass over more tlaan one joint, and which act to a certain extent as elastic ligaments in restraining certain actions of one joint, except when combined with corresponding movements of the other—these latter movements being usually in the opposite direction. Thus the shortness of the hamstring-muscles prevents complete flexion of the hip, unless the knee-joint bo also flexed so as to bring their attachments nearer together. The uses of this arrangement arc threefold, i. It co-ordinates the kinds of movement which arc the most habitual and necessary, and enables them to be performed witli the least expenditure of power. ' Thus in the usual gesture of the arms, whether in grasping or rejecting, the shoulder andOF THE SPINE. the elbow aro flexed simultaneously, and simultaneously extended,' in consequenco •of the passage of the biceps and triceps cubiti over both joints. 2. It enables the short muscles which pass over only one joint to act upon more than one. ' Thus if the Eectus femoris remain touically of such length that when stretched over the extended hip, it compels extension of the knee, then the Gluteus maximus becomes not only an extensor of the hip, but an extensor of the knee as well.' 3. It pi-ovides the joints with ligaments which, while they are of very great power in resisting movements to an extent incompatible with the mechanism of the joint, at the same time spontaneously yield when necessary. ' Taxed beyond its strength a ligament will be ruptured, whereas a contracted muscle is easily relaxed; also, if neighbouring joints be united by ligaments, the amount of flexion or extension of each must remain in constant proportion to that of the other ; while, if the union •be by muscles, the sepai'ation of the points of attachment of those muscles may vary considerably in diiferent varieties of movement, the muscles adapting them- selves tonicaUy to the length required.' The quotations are from a very interest- .ing paper, by Dr. Cleland, in the ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' No. i. 1866, p. 85 ; by whom I believe this important fact in the mechanism of joints was first clearly pointed out, though it has been independently observed afterwards by other anatomists. The articulations may be arranged into those of the trunk, those of the upper I extremity, and those of the lower extremity. AETICULATIONS OF THE TRUNK. These may be divided into the following groups, viz.:— I. Of the vertebral column. VII. Of the cartilages of the ribs with II. Of the atlas with the axis. the sternum, and with each other, III. Of the atlas with the occipital bone. YHI. Of the sternum. rV. Of the axis with the occipital bone. IX. Of the vertebral column with the V. Of the lower jaw. pelvis. VI. Of the ribs with the vertebrae. X. Of the pelvis. I. Articulations of the Vebtebeal Column. The difi"erent segments of the spine are connected together by ligaments, which admit of the same arrangement as the vertebra. They may be divided into five sets._ I. Those connecting the hodies of the vertebrse. 2. Those connecting the lammce. 3. Those connecting the articular processes. 4. Those connecting the spmms processes. 5. T^hose of the transverse processes. The articulations of the hodies of the vertebrae with each other form a series of amphiarthrodial jomts: those between the articular processes form .a series of arthrodial jomts. I.

Tt consists of dense longitudinal fibres, mtSnrof t r^^^^ adherent to the intervertebral substance, and the prominent margins of the vertebrae ; but less closely to the middle of the bodies. In theARTICULATIONS. latter situation the fibres are exceediugly thick, and serve to fill up the concavities on their front surface, and to make the anterior surface of the spine more even. This ligament is composed of several layers of fibres, which vary in length, but are closely interlaced with each other. The most superficial or longest fibres extend between four or five vcrtebrD3. A second subjacent set extend between two or tbreo vertebra); whilst a third set, the shortest and deepest, extend from one vertebra to the next. At the side of the bodies, the ligament consists of a few short fibres, which pass from one vertebra to the next, separated from the median portion by large oval apertures, for the passage of vessels. The Posterior Oovimon lAgcment (figs. ii6, 120) is situated within the spinal canal, and extends along the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebra, from the body of the axis above, whore it is continuous with the occipito-axoid ligament, to the sacram below. It is broader at the upper than at the lower part of the spine, and thicker in the dorsal than in the cervical or lumbar regions. In the situation of the intervertebral substance and contiguous margins of the vertebrae, where the ligament is more intimately adherent, it is broad, and presents a series of dentations with intervening concave margins ; but it is narrow and thick over the centre of the bodies, from which it is separated by the venoe, basis vertebrce. This ligament is composed of smooth, shining, longitudinal fibres, denser and more com- pact than those of the anterior ligament, and composed of a superficial layer occupying the interval between three or four vertebrae, and of a deeper layer which extends between one vertebra and the next adjacent to it. It is separated from the dura mater of the spinal cord by some loose filamentous tissue, very liable to serous infiltration. The Intervertebral Substance (fig. 116) is a lenticular disc of fibro-cartilage, in- terposed between the adjacent surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum, and forming the chief bond of connection between those bones. These discs vary in shape, size, and thickness, in different parts of the spine. In shape they accurately correspond with the surfaces of the bodies between which they are placed, being oval in the cervical and lumbar regions, and circular in the153 OF THE SPINE, dorsal. Their size is greatest in the himbar region. In ihickness they vary not only in the different regions of the spine, but in different parts of the same region: thus, they are uniformly thick in the lumbar region ; thickest, in front, in the I cervical and lumbar regions which are convex forwards ; and behind, to a slight extent, in the dorsal region. They thus contribute, in a great measure, to the curvatures of the spine in the neck and loins ; whilst the concavity of the dorsal region is chiefly due to the shape of the bodies of the vertebroa. The interverte- bral discs form about one-fourth of the spinal column, exclusive of the first two vertebriB ; they are not equally distributed, however,*between the various bones; the dorsal portion of the spine having, in proportion to its length, a much smaller quantity than in the cervical and lumbar regions, which necessarily gives to the latter parts greater pliancy and freedom of movement. The intervertebral discs 1 are adherent, by their surfaces, to the adjacent parts of the bodies of the vertebra; I and by their circumference are closely connected in front to the anterior, and i behind to the posterior common ligament; whilst, in the dorsal region, they are connected laterally, by means of the interarticular ligament, to the heads of those ribs which articulate with two vertebrae; they, consequently, form part of the articular cavities in which the heads of these bones are received. The intervertebral substance is composed, at its circumference, of laminae of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage; and, at its centre, of a soft, elastic, pulpy matter. The laminse are arranged concentrically one within the other, with their edges turned towards the corresponding surfaces of the vertebrae, and consist of alternate plates of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage. These plates are not quite vertical in theii- direction, those near the circumference being curved outwards and closely approximated; whilst those nearest the centre curve in the opposite direction, and are somewhat more widely separated. The fibres of which each plate is composed, are directed, for the most part, obliquely from above downwards ; the fibres of art adjacent plate have an exactly opposite arrangement, varying in their direction in every layer ; whilst in some few they are horizontal. This laminar arrangement belongs to about the outer half of each disc, the central part being occupied by a soft, pulpy, highly elastic substance, of a yellowish colour, which rises up con- siderably above the surrounding level, when the disc is divided horizontally. This substance presents no concentric arrangement, and consists of white fibrous tissue, with cells of variable shape and size interspersed. The pulpy matter, which is • especially well developed in the lumbar region, is separated from immediate con- tact with the vertebrae by the interposition of thin plates of cartilage, 2, Ligaments connecting the Lamin^. Ligamenta Subflava. The Ligamenta Sulflava (fig. 116) are interposed between the lamina3 of the vertebra,, from the axis to the sacrum. They are most distinct when seen from the interior of the spinal canal; when viewed from the outer surface, they appear short, bemg overiapped by the laminae. Each Hgament consists of two lateral portions which commence on each side at the root of either articular process, and pass backwards to the point where the laming converge to form the spinous process, Irtl!

Tho Capsular 'Litjaments (fig. 118) aro thin and h)osc ligamentous sacs, attached to tho contiguous margins of the articulating processes of each vertebra?, through tho greater part of their circumference, and completed internally by the ligamenta subllava. They are longer and more loose in the cervical than in the dorsal or lumbar regions. Tho capsular ligaments are lined on their inner surface by synovial membrane. 4. Ligaments connecting the Spinous Pbocesses. Inter-spinous, Supra..spiiious. The Inter-spiiwus Licjaments (fig. 116), thin and membranous, are interposed between the spinous processes in the dorsal and lumbar regions. Each ligament extends from the root to near the summit of each spinous process, and connects together theii- adjacent margins. They are narrow and elongated in the dorsal region, broader, quadrilateral in form, and thicker in the lumbar region. The Supraspinous Ligavient is a strong fibrous cord, which connects together the apices of the spinous processes from the seventh cervical to the spine of the sacrum. It is thicker and broader in the lumbar than in the dorsal region, and intimately blended, in both situations, with the neighbouring aponeuroses. The most superficial fibres of this ligament connect three or four vertebra; those deeper seated pass between two or three vertebras; whilst the deepest connect the contiguous extremities of neighbouring vertebrae. 5. Ligaments connecting the Tkansvekse Processes. Inter-transverse. The Inter-transverse Ligaments consist of a few thin scattered fibres, interposed between the transverse processes. They are generally wanting in the cervical region ; in the dorsal, they are rounded cords; in the lumbar region they are thm and membranous. Actions. The movements permitted in the spinal column are. Flexion, Extension, Lateral movement, Circumduction, and Rotation. In Flexion, or movement of the spine forwards, the anterior common ligament is relaxed, and the intervertebral substances are compressed in front; while the posterior common ligament, the ligamenta subflava, and the inter- and supra- spinous ligaments, are stretched, as well as the posterior fibres of the interver- tebral discs. The interspaces between the laminae are widened, and the inferior articular processes of the vertebite above glide upwards, upon the articular pro- cesses of the vertebrae below. Flexion is the most extensive of all the movemen; of the spine. •. j- In Extension, or movement of the spine backwards, an exactly opposite disjio- sition of the parts takes place. This movement is not extensive, being limited by the anterior common ligament, and by tho approximation of the spmouS pro^s^ses.^ and extension are most free in the lower part of the lumbar, and in the cervical regions ; extension in the latter region being greater than fiexion, tho reverse of which is the case in the lumbar region. These movements ai-e least free in the middle and upper part of tho back. In Lateral Movement, the sides of the intervertebral discs arc compressed tbe extent of motion being limited by the resistance offered by the surrounding liga- ments, and by the approximation of the transvei-se processes. This movement may take place in any part of the spine, but is most free in the neck and loins.155 OF THE ATLAS WITH THE AXIS. ,. ■ Circimd'uctimi is very limited, and is produced merely by a sucoession of the preceding movements. Rotation is produced by tlie twdsting of tbe intervertebral substances ; this, although only slight between any two vertebrae, produces a great extent of move- ment, when it takes place in the whole length of the spine, the fi-ont of the column being turned to one or the other side. This movement takes place only to a slight extent in the neck, but is more free in the lower part of the dorsal and lumbar regions. It is thus seen that the cemical region enjoys the greatest extent of each vai-iety of movement, flexion and extension especially being very free. In the dorsal region, especially at its upper part, the movements are most limited ; flexion, extension, and lateral motion taking place only to a slight extent. II. Articulation of the Atlas with the Axis. The articulation of the anterior arch of the atlas with, the odontoid process forms a lateral ginglymus joint, whilst that between the articulating processes of the two bones forms a double arthrodia. The ligaments which connect these bones are, the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid. Transverse. Posterior Atlo-Axoid. Two Capsular. Of the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid Ligaments (fig. 117), the more superficial is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line; it is attached, above, to the tubercle on 117—Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments.

Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments, Posterior View, The Transverse Ligament* (figs. 119, 120) is a thick and strong ligamentous band, which arches across the ring of the atlas, and serves to retain, the odontoid process in firm connection with its anterior arch. This Hgament is flattened from [19.—Articulation between Odontoid Process and Atla.s, before backwards, broader and thicker in the middle than at either extremity, and firmly attached on each side of the atlas to a small tubercle on the inner surface * It has been foimd necessary to describe the transverse hgament with those of the atlas and axis ; but the student must remember that it is really a portion of the mechanism by which the movements of the head on the spine arc regulated; so that the connections between the atlas and axis ought always trfbe studied together with those betweeu the latter bones and the skull.157 SPINE WITH THE CRANIUM. of its lateral mass. As it crosses the odontoid process, a small fasiculus is derived from its upper and lower boi-dors ; the former passing upwards, to bo inserted into the basilar process of tlio occipital bone; the latter, downwards, to be attached to the root of the odontoid process ; hence, the whole ligament has received the name of cruciform. The transverse ligament divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal parts: of these, the posterior and larger serves for the transmission of the cord and its membranes : the anterior and smaller contains the odontoid process. Since the lower border of the space between the anterior arch of the atlas and the transverse ligament is smaller than the upper (because the transverse ligament embraces firmly the narrow neck of the odontoid process), this process is retained in firm connection with, "the atlas when all the other ligaments have been divided. The Oapsular Ligaments are two thin and loose capsules, connecting the articular surfaces of the atlas and axis, the fibres being strongest on the anterior and external part of tke articulation. 120.—I Occipito-Axoid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments.

III. Articulation of the Atlas with the Occipital Bone. This articulation is a double artlivodia. Its ligaments are the Two Anterior Occiplto-Atloid. Posterior Occipito-Atloid. Two Lateral Occipito-Atloid. Two Capsular. Of the Tim Anterior TAcjamonts (fig. 117), the superficial is a strong, narrow, rounded cord, attached, above, to the basilar process of the occiput; below, to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas : the deeper ligament is a broad and thin membranous layer which passes between the anterior margin of the foramen magnum above, and the whole length of the upper border of the anterior arch of the atlas below. This ligament is in. relation, in front, with the Recti antici minores ; behind, with the odontoid ligaments. The Posterior Occipito-Atloid Ligament (fig. 118) is a very bi'oad but thin membranous lamina, intimately blended with the dura mater. It is connected, above, to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum ; below, to the upper border of the posterior arch of the atlas. This ligament is incomplete at each side, and forms, with the superior intervertebral notch, an opening for the passage of the vertebral artery and sub-occipital nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the Recti postici minores and Obliqui superiores ; in front, with the dura mater of the spinal canal, to which it is intimately adherent. The Lateral Ligaments are strong fibrous bands, directed obliquely upwards and inwards, attached above to the jugular process of the occipital bone; below, to the base of the transverse process of the atlas. The Capsular Ligaments surround the condyles of the occipital bone, and con- nect them with the articular surfaces of the atlas ; they consist of thin and loose capsules, which enclose the synovial membrane of the articulation. The synovial membranes between the occipital bone and atlas communicate occasionally with that between the posterior surface of the odontoid process and transverse ligament. Actions. The movements permitted in this joint are flexion and extension, which give rise to the ordinary forward or backward nodding of the head, besides slight lateral motion to one or the other side. "When either of these actions is carried beyond a slight extent, the whole of the cervical portion of the spine assists in its production. According to Cruveilhier, there is a slight motion of rotation in this joint. IV. Articulation of the Axis with the Occipital Bone. Occipito-Axoid. Three Odontoid. To expose these ligaments, the spinal canal should be laid open by removing the posterior arch of the atlas, the laminaa and spinous process of the axis, and the portion of the occipital bone behind the foramen magnum, as seen in fig. 120. The Occipito-Axoid Ligament (Apparatus ligamentosus colli) is situated at the upper part of the front surface of the spinal canal. It is a broad and strong ligamentous band, which covers the odontoid process and its hgaments, and appears to be a prolongation upwards of the posterior common ligament of the spine. It is attached, below, to the posterior surface of the body of the axis, and becoming expanded as it ascends, is inserted into the basilar groove of the occipital bone, iu front of the foramen magnum. Belations. By its anterior surface, it is intimately connected with the transverse ligament, by its posterior surface with the dura mater. By cutting this ligament across, and turning its ends aside, the transverse and odontoid ligaments are exposed. The Odontoid or Oheck Ligaments are strong, rounded, fibrous cords, which arise one on either side of the apex of the odontoid process, and passing obliquely upwards and outwards, are insei'tcd into the rough depressions on tlie inner sideTEMPORO-MAXILLARY. 159 of the condyles of tlie occipital bone. In .the triangalar interval left between these ligaments and the mavgiu of the foramen magnum, a third strong ligamentous band (ligamentum suspensorium) may be seen, which passes almost perpendicularly from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen, being intimately blended with the anterior occipito-atloid ligament, and upper fasciculus of the transverse ligament of the atlas. Actions. The odontoid ligaments serve to limit the extent to which rotation of the cranium may be carried; hence they have received the name of checJc- ligaments. Y. Temporo-Maxillart Articulation. This is an arthrodial joint; the parts entering into its formation are, on each side, the anterior part of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone and the eminentia articularis above; with the condyle of the lower jaw below. The ligaments are the following: External Lateral. Stylo-maxillary. Infernal Lateral. Capsular. Interarticular Fibre-cartilage. The External Lateral Ligament (fig. 121) is a short, thin, and naiTOw fasci- • cuius attached above to the outer surface of the zygoma and to the rough tnbercle on its lower border; below, to the outer surface and posterior border of the neck 121.- -Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.

Internal View, process of the temporal bone, to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw, between the Masseter, and Internal pterygoid muscles. This Ugament separates the parcrtid from the sub-maxillary gland, and has attached to its inner side part of the fibres of origin of the Stylo-glossus muscle. Although usu- ally classed among the ligaments of the jaw, it can only be considered as an accessory in the articulation. Along with the stylo- maxillary ligament, may be described the stylo- hyoid ligament, although it is in no way connected with the functions of the lower jaw. This is a fibrous cord, which continues the styloid process down to the hyoid bone, being attached to the tip of the former and the small cornu of the latter. It is often more or less ossified. The Capsular Ligament consists of a thin and loose ligamentous capsule, attached above to the circumference of the glenoid cavity and the articular surface immediately in front; below, to the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw. ^ It consists of a few thin scattered fibres, and can hardly be considered as a distinct ligament; it is thickest at the back part of the articulation. The Interariicular Fihro-cartilage (fig. 123) is a thin plate of an oval form, placed horizontally between the condyle of the jaw and the glenoid cavity. Its upper surface is concave from before backwards, and a little convex trans- versely, to accommodate itself to the form of the glenoid cavity. Its under surface, where it is in contact _yg,tjcal Section of Temporo-Maxillary Articulation, with the condyle, is ^ concave. Its circum- ference is connected ex- ternally to the external lateral ligament; inter- nally, to the capsular ligament; and in front to the tendon of the Ex- ternal pterygoid muscle. It is thicker at its cir- cumference, especially behind, than at its cen- tre, where it is some- • times perforated. The • Dr Humnhrv describes the internal portion of tbe capsuhu: ligament separately, as the 8h?rt fSKoraT^ament; and it cLainly seems as cTescmng of a separate descnp- tion as the external lateral ligament is.RIBS WITH VERTEBRJi:. fibres of whicli it is composed bavo a concentric arrangement, more apparent at the circumference than at the centre. Its surfaces are smooth, and divide the joint into two cavities, each of which is furnished with a separate synovial mem- brane. When the fibro-cartilage is perforated, the synovial membranes are con- tinuous with one another. The Synovial Membranes, two in number, are placed one above, and the other below the fibro-cartilage. The upper one, the larger and looser of the two, is con- tinued from the margin of the cartilage covering the glenoid cavity and eminentia ai'ticularis, over the upper surface of the fibro-cartilage. The lower one is inter- posed between the under surface of the fibro-cartilage and the condyle of the jaw, being prolonged downwards a little further behind than in front. The Nei-ves of this joint are derived from the auriculo-temporal and masseteric branches of the inferior maxillary. Actions. The movements permitted in this articulation are very extensive. Thus, the jaw may be depressed or elevated, or it may be carried forwards or back- wards, or from side to side. It is by the alternation of these movements performed in succession, that a kind of rotatory movement of the lower jaw upon the upper takes place, which materially assists in the mastication of the food. If the movement of depression is carried only to a slight extent, the condyles remain in the glenoid cavities, their anterior part descending only slightly; but if depression is considerable, the condyles glide from the glenoid fossfe on to the articular eminences, carrying with them the interarticular fibro-cartilages. When this movement is carried to too great an extent, as, for instance, during a convul- sive yawn, dislocation of the condyle into the zygomatic fossa may occur; the interarticular cartilage being carried forwards, and the capsular ligament ruptured. When the jaw is elevated, after forced depression, the condyles and fibro-cartilages are carried backwards into their original position. When the jaw is carried horizontally forwards and backwards, or from side to side, a horizontal glidino- movement of the fibro-cartilages and condyles upon the glenoid cavities takes place in the corresponding direction. VI. Aeticulations op the Ribs with the Vertebra, The articulations of the ribs with the vertebral column may be divided into two sets; I. Those which connect the heads of the ribs with the bodies of the vertebrae • 2. Those which connect the necks and tubercles of the ribs with tlie transverse processes. I. Articulations between the Heads of the Ribs and the Bodies OP THE Vertebra, (jPig. 124.) These constitute a series of ginglymoid joints, formed by the articulation of the heads of the ribs with the cavities on the contiguous margins of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, connected together by the following ligaments Anterior Costo-vertebral or Stellate.

In the tenth, eleventh and twelfth ribs also, which likewise ar- ticulate with a single vertebra, the division does not exist; but tho upper fibres of the liga- ment, in eacb case, are connected with the ver- tebra above, as well as that with which the ribs articulate. The Capsular Liga- ment is a thin and loose ligamentous bag, which surrounds the joint be- tween the bead of the rib and the articular cavity formed by the junction of the vertebrae. It is very thin, firmly connected with the anterior ligament, and most distinct at the upper and lower parts of the articulation. The Interarticular Ligament is situated in the interior of the joint. It consists of a short band of fibres, flattened from above downwards, attached by one extremity to the sharp crest on the head of the rib, and by the other to the intervertebral disc. It divides the joint into two cavities, which have no communication with one another, but are each lined by a separate synovial membrane. In the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, the interai-ticular ligament does not exist-, conse- quently, there is but one synovial membrane. Actions. The movements permitted in these articulations are limited to eleva- tion, depression, and a slight amount of movement forwards and backwards. The mobility, however, of the different ribs varies very much. The first rib is almost immoveable, excepting in deep inspiration. The movement of the second rib is also not very extensive. In the other ribs, theii- mobility increases successively down to the last two, whicb are very moveable. The ribs are generally more moveable in the female than in the male. INTCR-ARTrCULAn LIST 2. AfiTlCULATIONS OF THE NeCKS AND TUBEHCLES OF THE RiBS WITH THE Transverse Processes. (Fig. 125.) The ligaments connecting these parts are— Anterior Costo-Tbansverse.

It is broader below than above, broader and thinner between the lower ribs than between the upper, and more distinct in front than behind. This ligament is in relation, in front, with the intercostal vessels and nerves; behind, with the Lougissimus dorsi. Its internal harder completes an aperture formed between it and the articular processes, through which pass the posterior branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves. Its external border is continuous with a thin aponeurosis, which covers the External intercostal muscle The first and last rihs have no anterior costo-trans verse ligament. The Middle Gosto-Transverse or Interosseous Ligament consists of shoi-t, but strong, fibres, which pass between the rough surface on the posterior part of the neck of each rib, and the anterior surface of the adjacent transverse process. In order fully to expose this ligament, a horizontal section should be made across the transverse process and corresponding part of the rib; or the rib may be forcibly separated from the transverse process, and its fibres put on the stretch. In the eleventh and twelfth H&s, this ligament is quite rudimentary. The Posterior Oosto-Transverse Ligament is a short, but thick and strong, fasciculus, which passes obhquely from the summit of the transverse process to the rough non-articular portion of the tubercle of -the rib. This ligament is shorter and more obUque in the upper than in the lower ribs. Those corresponding to the superior ribs ascend, and those of the inferior ones slightly descend. In the eleventh and twelfth rihs, this hgament is wanting.

The superficial fibres of this ligament are the longest; they intermingle with the fibres of the ligarnents above and below them, with those of the opposite side, and with the tendinous fibres of origin of the Pectoralis major; forming a thick fibrous membrane, which covers the surface of the sternum. This is more distinct at the lower than at the upper part. The Posterior Oosto-Sternal Ligament, less thick and distinct than the ante- rior, is composed of fibres which radiate from the posterior surface of the sternal end of the cartilages of the true ribs, to the posterior surface of the sternum, becoming blended with the periosteum. The Gwpsidar Ligament surrounds the joints formed between the cartilages of the true ribs and the sternum. It is very thin, intimately blended with the anterior and posterior ligaments, and strengthened at the upper and lower part of the articulation by a few fibres, which pass from the cartilage to the side of the sternum. These ligaments protect the synovial membranes. Synovial Membranes. The cartilage of ih.e first rib is directly continuous with the sternum, without any synovial membrane. The cartilage of the second rib is connected with the sternum by means of an interarticular ligament, attached by one extremity to the cartilage of the second rib, and by the other extremity to the cartMage which unites the first and second pieces of the sternum. This articulation is provided with two synovial membranes. That of the thu'd rib has also two synovial membranes ; and that of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, each a single synovial membrane. Thus there are eiglit synovial cavities on each side in the articulations between the costal cartilages of the true ribs and the sternum. They may be demonstrated by removing a thin section from the anterior surface of the sternum and cartilages, as seen in the figui'e. After middle life, the articular surfaces lose their poHsh, become roughened, and the synovial membranes appear to be wanting, In old age, the articulations do not exist, the cartilages of most of the ribs becoming continuous with the sternum. The cartilage of the seventh rib, and occasionally also that of the sixth, is connected to the anterior surface of the ensiform appendix, by a band of ligamentous fibres, which varies in length and breadth in different subjects. It is called the costo-xiphoid ligament^ Actions. The movements which are permitted in the costo-sternal articulaitions, are limited to elevation and depression; and these only to,a slight extent. Articulations of the Caetilagbs of the Ribs with each other (Inter-Chondral). (Fig. 126.) The cartilages of the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs articulate, by their lower borders with the corresponding margin of the adjoining cartilages, by means of a small, smooth, oblong-shaped facet. Each articulation is enclosed in a thru capsular ligament, lined by synovial membrane, and strengthened externally and internally by ligamentous fibres (intercostal ligaments), which pass from one cartilage to the other. Sometimes the cartilage of the fifth rib, more rarely that of the ninth, articulates, by its lower border, with the^ adjoining cartilage by a small oval facet; rtiore frequently they are connected'together by a few hgamentous fibres. Occasionally, the articular surfaces above-mentioned are wanting. Articulations of the Ribs with their Cartilages (Costo-chondral). (Fig. 126.) The outer extremity of each costal cartilage is received into a depression in the sternal end of the ribs, and held together by the periosteum. VIII. Ligaments op the Sternum. The first and second pieces of the Sternum are united by a layer of cartilage, which rarely ossifies, except at an advanced period of life. These two segments are connected by an anterior and posterior ligament. (See on this head p. 75 note.)i66 ARTICULATIONS. The ayiterior sternal ligament consists of a layer of fibres, having a longitiTdinal direction ; it blends with the libres of the anterior costo-sternal ligaments on both sides, and with the aponeurosis of origin of the Pectoralis major. This ligament is rough, irregular, and much thicker at the lower than at the upper part of the bone. The posterior sternal ligament is disposed in a somewhat similar manner on the posterior surface of the articulation. IX. Articulation op the Pelvis with the Spine. The ligaments connecting the last lumbar vertebra with the sacrum are similar to those which connect the segments of the spine with each other, viz.:—i. The continuation downwards of the anterior and posterior common ligaments. 2. The intervertebral substance connecting the flattened oval surfaces of the two bones, and forming an amphiarthrodial joint. 3. Ligamenta subflava, connecting the 127.—Articulations of Pelvis and Hip, Anterior View. arch of the last lumbar vertebra with the posterior border of the sacral canal. 4. Capsular ligaments connecting the articulating processes and forming a double arthrodia. 5. Inter- and supra-spinous Kgaments. The two proper ligaments connecting the pelvis with the spine are the lumbo- sacral and ilio-lumbar. The Lumbo-scMral Ligwtnent (fig. 127) is a short, thick, triangular fasciculus, which is connected above to the lower and front pai*t of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, passes obliquely outwards, and is attached below to the lateral surface of the base of the sacrum, becoming blended with the anterior sacixD-iliae ligament. This ligament is in relation in front with the Psoas muscle. The Tlio-lumhar Li.gamcnt (fig. 127) passes horizontally outwards from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, to the crcst of theSACRUM AND ILIUM. 167 ilium immediately in front of tho saoro-iliao articulation. It is of a triangular form, thick and narrow internally, bimd and thinner externally. It is in relation, in front, with the Psoas muscle; behind, with the muscles occupying the vertebral groove; above, with the Quadratus lumborum. X. Articulations op the Pelvis. The Ligaments connecting the bones of the pelvis with each other may be divided into four groups :—i. Those connecting the sacrum and ilium. 2. Those passing between the sacrum and ischium. 3. Those connecting the sacrum and coccyx. 4. Those between the two pubic bones. I. Articulation of the Sacrum and Ilium. The sacro-iliac articulation is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed between the lateral surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. The anterior or auricular portion of each articular surface is covered with a thin plate of cartilage, thicker on the sacrum than on the ilium. The surfaces of these cartilages in the adult are rough and irregular, and separated from one another by a soft yellow pulpy substance. At an early period of life, occasionally in the adult, and in the female during pregnancy, they are smooth, and lined by a delicate synovial membrane. The ligaments connecting these surfaces are the anterior and posterior sacro-iliac. The Anterior Sacro-iliac lAgament (fig. 127) consists of numerous thin liga- mentous bands, which connect the anterior surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. The Posterior Sacro-iliac (fig. 128) is a strong interosseous ligament, situated in a deep depression between the sacrum and ilium behind, and forming the chief bond of connection between those bones. It consists of numerous strong fasciculi, which pass between the bones in various directions. Three of these are of large size; the two superior, nearly horizontal in direction, arise from the first and second transverse tubercles on the posterior surface of the sacrum, and are inserted into the rough uneven surface at the posterior part of the inner surface of the ilium. The third fasciculus, oblique in direction, is attached by one ex- tremity to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum and by the other to the posterior superior spine of the ilium j it is sometimes called the ohliciue sacro-iliac ligament. 2. Ligaments passing between the Sacrum and Ischium, (Fig. 128.) The Great Sacro-Sciatic (Posterior), The Lesser Sacro-Sciatic (Anterior). The G-reat or Posterior Sacro-Sciatic lAgament is situated at the lower and back part of the pelvis. It is thin, flat, and triangular in form ; narrower in the middle than at the extremities ; attached by its broad base to the posterior inferior spine of the ilium, to the fourth and fifth transverse tubercles on the sacrum, and to the lower part of the lateral margin of that bone and the coccyx ; passing obhquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, it becomes narrow and thick • and at its insertion into the inner margin of the tuberosity of the ischium, it increases in breadth, and is prolonged forwards along the inner margin of the ramus formino- what is known as the falciform Hgament. The free concave edge of this licrament has attached to it the obturator fascia, with which it forms a kind of o-roove pro- tectmg the internal pudic vessels and nerve. One of its surfaces is turSed towards the penneeum, the other towards the Obturator internus muscle The posterior surface of this ligament gives origin, by its whole extent, -to fibres of the Gluteus maximus Its ante^-ior smface is united to the lesser sacro-sciatic hgament.

They are the— Anterior Sacro-Coccygeal. Posterior Sacro-Coccygeal. Interposed Fibro-Cartilage. The - Anterior Sacro-Goccijgeal Ligament consists of a few irregular fibres, • which descend fi'om the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx, becoming blended with the periosteum. The Posterior Sacro-Ooccygeal Ligament is a flat band of ligamentous fibres, of a pearly tint, "which arises from the margin of the lower orifice of the sacral canal, and descends to be inserted into the posterior surface of the coccyx. This ligament completes the lower and back part of the sacral canal. Its superficial fibres are much longer than the deep-seated ; the latter extend from the apex of the sacrum to the upper cornua of the coccyx. This ligament is in relation on front -with the arachnoid membrane of the sacral canal, a portion of the sacrum and almost the whole of the posterior surface of the coccyx; behind, with the Gluteus maximus. A Fibro-Gartilage is interposed between the contiguous surfaces of the sacrum and coccyx; it differs from that interposed between the bodies of the Tertebrce in being thinner, and its central pai-t more firm in textm-e. It is somewhat thicker in ft-ont and behind than at the sides. Occasionally, a synovial membrane is found where the coccyx is freely moveable, which is more especially the case pregnancy. The different segments of the coccyx are connected together by an extension downwards of the anterior and posterior sacro-coccygeal ligaments, a thin annular disc of fibro-cartilage being interposed between each of the bones. In the adult male, aU the pieces become ossified; but in the female, this does not commonly occur until a later period of life. The separate segments of the coccyx are first united, and at a more advanced age the joint between the sacrum and coccyx is obliterated. Actions. The movements which take place between the sacrum and coccyx, and between the different pieces of the latter bone, are slightly forwards and back-' wards ; they are very limited. Their extent increases during pregnancy. 4. Aeticulatiok of the Pttbes. (Fig. 129.) The articulation between the pubic bones is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed by the junction of the two oval articular surfaces of the ossa pubis. The articular surface has been described above under the name of symphysis, and the same name is given to the joint. The ligaments of this articulation are the Anterior Pubic. Posterior Pubic. Superior Pubic. Sub-Pubic. Interposed Fibro-OartUage. The Anterior PuUc Ligament consists of several superimposed layers, which pass across the front of the articulation. The superficial fibres pass obliquely from one bone to the other, decussating and forming an interlacement with the fibres of the aponeurosis of the External obhque muscle. The deep fibres pass transversely across the symphysis, and are blended with the fibro-cartilage. The Posterior PuUc Ligament consists of a few thin, scattered fibres, which unite the two pubic bones posteriorly. The Suferior PuUc Ligament is a band of fibres, which connects together the two pubic bones superiorly. The 8uh.Piohic Ligament is a thick, triangular arch of ligamentous fibres, connectmg together the two pubic bones below, and forming the upper boundary ot the pubic arch. Above, it is blended with the interarticular fibro-cartila-e ;ARTICULATIONS. laterally, with the rami of the pubcs. Its fibres are of a yellowish colour, closely connected, and have an arched direction. The Interposed Fihro-Oartilage consists of two oval-shaped plates, one covering the surface of each symphysis pubis.

Their opposed surfaces are connected in the greater pai-t of their extent, by an intermediate elastic fibrous tissue; and by their circumference to the various ligaments surrounding the joint.

Actions This articulation is' the centre of the movements of the shoulder, and admits of motion in nearly every direction—upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards as well as circumduction. ' The movements attendant on elevation and depression of the shoulder take place between the clavicle and the interarticular lia-ament the bone rotating upon the ligament on an axis drawn from before back- wards through its own articular facet. When the shoulder is moved forwards and backwards, the clavicle, with the interarticular ligament, rolls to and fro on the articular sui-face of the sternum, revolving, with a slightly sliding movement, round an axis drawn nearly vertically through the sternum.. In the circumduction of the shoulder which is compounded of these two movements, the clavicle revolves upon the interarticular cartilage, and the latter, with the clavicle, rolls upon the sternum.' * II. ScAPTJLO-Clavicular Aeticulation. (Pig. 131-) The 8capulo.Glavicular is an arthrodial joint, formed between the outer extre- mity of the clavicle, and the upper edge of the acromion process of the scapula.

It is attached by its apex to a rough depression at the base of the coracoid process, internal to the preceding; above, by its expanded base, to the conoid tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle, and to a lino proceeding internally from it for half an inch. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius ; behind, with the Trapezius: they serve to limit rotation of the scapula forwards and backwards. The Interartioular Fibro-Oartilage is most frequently absent in this articulation. When it exists, it generally only partially separates the articular surfaces, and occupies the upper part of the articulation. More rarely, it completely separates the joint into two cavities. 131.—The Left Shoulder-Joint, Scapulo-Clavicukr Articulations and Proper Ligaments of Scapula. _ There are koo Synovial Memlranes when a complete interarticular cartilac^e exists ; more frequently there is only one synovial membrane Ackons The movements of this articulation are of two kinds, i.

Rotation of th! scapula forwards and backwards upon the clavicle, t»e extent of this rotation beino- limited by the two portions of the coraco-clavicular ligament. The scapulo-clavicular joint has important functions in the movements of the upper extremity.

Again, when the whole arch formed by the clavicle and scapula rises and falls (in elevation or depression of the shoulders), the jomt between these two bones enables the scapula still to mamtam its lower part m contact with the ribs. III. Proper Ligaments op the Scapula. (Fig. 131.) The proper hgaments of the scapula are, the Coraco-acromial. Transverse. The Coraoo-acromial Ligament is a broad, thin flat band of a triangular shape extended transversely above the upper part of the shoulder-joint, between he co^acoid and acromio; processes. It is attached, by its apex to the summit of the acromion iust in front of the articular surface for the clavicle; and by its W base to the whole length of the outer border of the coracoid process.

" 175 long head of the Triceps; externally, by the tendons o£ the Infraspinatus and Teres minor; and internally, by the tendon of the Subscapularis. The capsular ligament usually presents three openings : one at its inner side, below the coracoid process, partially filled up by the tendon of the Subscapularis ; it establishes a communication between the synovial membrane of the joint and a bursa beneath the tendon of that muscle. The second, which is not constant, is at the outer part, where a communication sometimes exists between the joint and a bursal sac belonging to the Infraspinatus muscle. The third is seen in the lower border of the ligament, between the two tuberosities, for the passage of the long tendon of the Biceps muscle. The Goraco-humeral or Accessory Ligament is a broad band which strengthens the upper and inner part of the capsular ligament. It arises from the outer border of the coracoid process, and passes obliquely downwards and outwards to the front of the great tuberosity of the humerus, being blended with the tendon of the Supraspinatus muscle. This ligament is intimately united to the capsular in the greater part of its extent. The Glenoid Ligament is a firm fibrous band attached round the margin of the glenoid cavity. It is triangular on section, the thickest portion being fixed to the circumference of the cavity, the free edge being thin and sharp. It is continuous above with the long tendon of the Biceps muscle, which bifurcates at the upper part of the cavity into two fasciculi, encircling the margin of the glenoid cavity and uniting at its lower part. This hgament deepens the cavity for articulation, and protects the edges of the bone. It is lined by the synovial membrane. The Synovial Membrane lines the margin of the glenoid cavity and the fibro- cartilaginous rim surrounding it ; it is then reflected over the internal surface of the capsular ligament, covers the lower part and sides of the neck of the humerus and is continued a short distance over the cartilage covering the head of the bone'. The long tendon of the Biceps muscle which passes through the capsular ligament, is enclosed in a tubular sheath of synovial membrane, which is reflected upon it at I the point where it perforates the capsule, and is continued around it as far as the i summit of the glenoid cavity. The tendon of the Biceps is thus enabled to traverse '. the articulation, but is not contained in the interior of the synovial cavity. The , synovial membrane communicates with a large bursal sac beneath the tendon of ' the Subscapularis, by an opening at the inner side of the capsular ligament; it also occasionally communicates with another bursal sac, beneath the tendon of the Infraspinatus, through an orifice at its outer part. A third bursal sac, which does not communicate with the joint, is placed between the under surface of the deltoid and the outer surface of the capsule. The Muscles in relation with the joint are, above, the Supraspinatus ; below the long head of the Triceps; internaUy, the Subscapularis ; externally, the Infra- ! spmatus, and Teres minor ; within, the long tendon of the Biceps. The Deltoid IS placed most externally, and covers the articulation on its outer side as well as m front and behind. ' The Arteries supplying the joint, are articular branches of the anterior and posterior circumflex, and suprascapular. The Nerves are derived from the circumflex and suprascapular Actions. The shoulder-joint is capable of movement in every direction, forwards, backwards, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and rotation j The most striking peculiarities in this joint are: i.

Those joints are therefore to be regarded as accessoiy structures to the shoulder-joint * The extent of these^movements of the seapula is very considerable, especially in extreme elevation of the arm which movement is ,1 T 1 I ^lion tlio arm is thrown somewhat forward, since the articular best accomplislied wnen I'no nil" .-.n ,n j -.i i • n % f Immerus is broader in the middle than at either end, especially the surlace ol tlie im elevation directly forward is less, and that directly bSard tin more xlstricted. The great width of the central portion of the uauK^a allows of very free horizontal movement when the arm is ™ d to a ri°'ht angle, in which movement the arch formed by the acromion, the comcoid process, and the coraco-acromial ligament, constitutes a sort of supple- mental articular cavity for the head of the bone. Mwii I . -1 The looseness of the capsule is so great that the arm will fall about an inch from the scapula when the muscles are dissected from the capsular ligament, and an opening made in it to remove the atmospheric pressure. The movements of the joint, therefore, are not regulated by the capsule, so much as by the surrounding muscles and by the pressure of the atmosphere, an arrangement which renders the movements of the joint much more easy than they would otherwise haVe been, and permits a swinging pendulum-like vibration of the limb, when the muscles are at rest' (Humphry.) The fact, also, that in all ordinary positions of the joint the capsule is not put on the stretch, enables the aim to move freely in all direclnons. Extreme movements are checked by the tension of appropriate portions of the capsule, as well as by the interlocking of the bones. Thus is said that abduc- tion is checked by the contact of the great tuberosity with the upper edge of the glenoid cavity, adduction by the tension of the coraco-humeral ligament. (Beaunis ^TTelntimlte union of the tendons of the four short muscles with the capsule converts these muscles into elastic and spontaneously-acting ligaments of the joint and it is regarded as being also intended to prevent the folds into which all portions :rthe caplle would alternately fall in the varying positions of the joint from being driven between the bones by the pressure of the atmosphere. The plculiar relations of the biceps tendon to the shoulder^oint appear to sub serve various purposes. In the first place by its connection with both the shoulde and elbow, the muscle harmonises the action of the two J-nts, and acts as an Xasttc hgament in all positions, in the manner previously adverted to t Nex^ t s r ng^^^^^ -^ticular cavity, and prevents the ^^ead of the humerus from being pressed up against the acromion process when the deltoid humerus trom o =1 ^ ^^^-^^ the glenoid cavity.

The articular surfaces are covered with a thin layer of cartilage, and connected together with the following ligaments: — Anterior. Internal Lateral. Posterior. External Lateral. The Anterior Ligament (fig. 132) is a broad and thin fibrous layer, which covers the anterior surface of the joint. It is attached to the front of the humerus immediately above the coronoid fossa; below, to the anterior surface of the corouoid process of the ulna and orbicular ligament, being continuous on each side with the lateral ligaments. Its superficial or oblique fibres pass from the mner condyle of the humerus outwards to the orbicular ligament. The middle fibres, vertical in dii*ection, pass from the upper part of the coronoid depression, and become blended with the preceding. A third, or transverse set, intersect these at right angles. This ligament is 132.—Left Elbow-Joint, showing Anterior in relation, in front, with the Brachialis anticus ; behind, with the synovial mem- brane. The Posterior Ligament (fig. 133) is a thin and loose membranous fold, attached, above, to the lower end of the humerus, immediately above the olecranon fossa; below, to the margin of the olecranon. The superficial or transverse fibres pass between the adjacent margins of the olecranon fossa. The deeper portion con- sists of vertical fibres, which pass from the upper part of the olecranon fossa to the margin of the olecranon. This liga- ment is in relation, behind, with the ten- don of the Triceps and the Anconeus ; in front, with the synovial membrane. The Internal Lateral Ligament (fig. 132) is a thick triangular band, consist- ing of two distinct portions, an anterior and posterior. The anterior portion, di- rected obliquely forwards, is attached, above, by its apex, to the front part of the internal condyle of the humerus; and, below, by its broad base, to the inner margin of the coronoid process. The posterior p>ortion, also of triangular form, is attached, above, by its apex, to the lower and back part of the internal condyle ; below, to the inner margin of the olecranon.

The Muscles in relation with tlio joint are, in front, the Bracliialis anticus ; be- hind, the Triceps and Anconeus; exter- nally, the Supinator brevis, and the com- mon tendon of origin of the Extensor muscles ; internally, the common tendon of origin of the Flexor muscles, and the Flexor carpi ulnaris, with the ulnar nerve. The Arteries supplying the joint are derived from the communicating branches between the superior profunda, inferior profunda, and anastomotic branches of the brachial, with the anterior, posterior, and interosseous recurrent branches of the ulnar, and the recurrent branch of the radial. These vessels form a complete chain of inosculation around the joint. The Nerves are derived from the ulnar, as it passes between the internal condyle and the olecranon; and a few filaments from the musculo-cutaneous. Actions. The elbow joint comprises three different portions : viz. the joint be- tween the ulna and humerus, that between the head of the radius and the humerus, and the superior radio-ulnar articulation,, described below. All these articular sur- faces are invested by a common synovial membrane, and the movements of the whole joint should be studied together. The combination of the movements of flexion and extension of the forearm with those of pronation and supination of the hand, which is ensured by the two being performed at the same joint, is essential to the accuracy of the various minute movements of the hand. The portion of the joint between the ulna and humerus is a simple hinge-joint, and allows of movements of flexion and extension only. The shape of the trochlear surface of the humerus, with its prominences and depressions accurately adapted to the opposing surfaces of the olecranon, prevents any lateral movement. In the ordinary position assumed by the humerus, when resting on the prominent internal condyle, this direct movement of flexion carries the hand inwards, towards the chest and mouth. The joint between the head of the radius and the capitellum or radial head of the humerus is an arthrodial joint. The bony surfaces would of themselves con- stitute an enarthrosis and allow of movement in all directions, were it not for the orbicular ligament by which the head of the radius is bound down firmly to the sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and which prevents any separation of the two bones laterally. It is to the same ligament that the head of the radius owes its security from dislocation, which would otherwise constantly occur, as a consequence of the shallowness of the cup-like surface on the head of the radius. In fact, but for this ligament, the tendon of the biceps would be liable to pull the head of the radius out of the joint.* In complete extension, the head of the i-adius glides so far back on the outer condyle that its edge is plainly felt at the back of the joint. * Humphry, op. cit. p. 419.RADIO-ULNAR. 179 In combination with any position of flexion or extension, the head of the radius can be rotated in the upper radio-ulnar joint, carrying the hand with it. The hand is articulated to the lower surface of the radius only, and the concave or sig- moid surface on the lower end of the radius travels round the lower end of the ulna. The latter bone is excluded from the wrist-joint (as will be seen in the sequel) by the triangular fibro-cartilage. Thus, rotation of the head of the radius, round an axis which passes through the external condyle of the humerus, imparts circular movement to the hand through a very considerable arc. If it is necessary to turn the hand upwards and downwards without changing its place (as in using a corkscrew), this circular movement is obviated by rapid instinctive compensating changes in the position of the elbow. VI. Radio-Ulnar Articulations. The articulation of the radius with the ulna is effected by ligaments, which connect together both extremities as well as the shafts of these bones. They may, consequently, be subdivided into three sets the superior radio-ulnar 2. the middle radio-ulnar; and, 3. the inferior radio-ulnar articulations. 1, Superior Radio-Ulnar Articulation. This articulation is a lateral ginglymus. The bones entering into its forma- tion are the inner side of the circumference of the head of the radius rotating within the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. These surfaces are covered with cartilage, and invested with a duplicature of synovial membrane, continuous with that which Hnes the elbow-joint. Its only ligament is the annular or orbi- cular. The Orbicular Ligament (fig. 133) is a strong, flat band of ligamentous fibres which surrounds the head of the radius, and retains it in firm connection with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. It forms about three-fourths of a fibrous ring attached by each end to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity, and is broader at the upper part of its circumference than below, by which means the head of the radius is more securely held in its position. Its outer surface is strengthened by the external lateral ligament of the elbow, and affords origin to part of the Supinator brevis muscle. Its imier surface is smooth, and Hned by synovial membrane Actions. The movement which takes place in this articulation is limited to rotation_ of the head of the radius within the orbicular ligament, and upon the lesser ^.gmoid cavity of the ulna; rotation forwards being called pronation-, rotation backwards, supination. 2.

The Literosseous Ligaments (fig. 136) are two narrow bundles of fibrous tissue, connecting the semilunar bone, on one side with the scaphoid, on the other with the cuneiform. They close the upper part of the interspaces between the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones, their upper surfaces being smooth, and lined by the synovial membrane of the wrist-joint. The ai'ticulation of the pisiform with the cuneiform is provided with a separate synovial membrane, protected by a thin capsular ligament. There are also two strong fibrous fasciculi, which connect this bone to the unciform and the base of the fifth metacarpal bone (fig. 134). 2. Articulations op the Second Row of Caepal Bones. These are also arthrodial joints. The articular surfaces are covered with carti- lage, and connected by the following ligaments :— Three Dorsal. Three Palmar. Two Interosseous. The three Dorsal Ligaments extend transversely from one bone to another on the dorsal surface, connecting the trapezium with the trapezoid, the trapezoid with the OS magnum, and the os magnum with the unciform. The three Palmar Ligaments have a similar arrangement on the palmar surface. The tiuo Interosseous Ligaments, much thicker than those of the first row, are placed one on each side of the os magnum, connecting it with the trapezoid externally, and the unciform internally. The former is less distinct than the latter. 3. Articulations of the Two Rows op Carpal Bones with each other. The articulations between the two rows of the carpus consist of a joint in the middle, formed by the reception of the head of the os magnum into a cavity formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bones, and of an arthrodial joint on each side, the outer one formed by the articulation of the scaphoid with the trapezium and trapezoid, the internal one by the articulation of the cuneiform and unciform. The articular surfaces are covered by a thin layer of cartilage, and connected by the following ligaments :— Anterior or Palmar. External Lateral. Posterior or Dorsal. Internal Lateral. The Anterior or Palmar Ligaments consist of short fibres, which pass obliquely between the bones of the first and second row on the palmar surface. The Posterior or Dorsal Ligaments have a similar arrangement on the dorsal surface of the carpus. The Lateral Ligaments are very short; they are placed, one on the radial, the other on the ulnar side of the carpus ; the former, the stronger and more distinct, connecting the scaphoid and trapezium bones, the latter the cuneiform and unci- form ; they are continuous with the lateral ligaments of the wrist-joint. The common Synovial Membrane of the Oarpus is very extensive ; it lines the under surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones, sending upwards two prolongations between their contiguous surfaces; it is then reflected over the bones of the second row, and sends down three prolongations between them, which iine their contiguous surfaces, and invest the carpal extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones. There is a separate synovial membrane between the pisiform and cuneiform bones. ^ciio^. The hand and wrist is divided by Meyer * into three parts The radius and the triangular cartilage. 2.

The meniscus, formed by the cuneiform, semi- lunar, and scaphoid ; the pisiform bone having no essential part in the movements of the hand. . , .i i j i These three elements form two joints :—i. The anterior between the hand and meniscus (transverse carpal joint, as itmay be called) mainly ginglymoid m character; 2. The posterior (wrist-joint proper) between the memscus and bones of the forearm, chiefly artlirodiaL , , , « i n ,^ I The ioint between the memscus and the other four bones of the carpus is subdivided into three portions-tho central formed between the deep cup of the semi- lunar above and the head of the os magnum with the adjacent part of the unciform ' below is a ginoaymoid joint in which some rotation is allowed ; the radial portion formed by the scaphoid articulating with a portion of the os magnum, the trape- zoid and trapezium, represents also a ginglymoid joint m which rotation is permitted ; while the ulnar portion or articulation of the cuneiform with the unciform partakes more of the arthrodial character. The axes of movement of these joints are incUned to each other at a considerable angle, so that m flexion of the hand on the forearm the carpal bones are brought together, and on the con- trary are separated in extension. Extension of the hand on the forearm or dorsi-flexion Meyer divides into three movements, corresponding to the three portions of the transverse joint. In the first the semilunar moves in its hinge-joint around the head of the osmagnum and the edge of the unciform until its motion is checked by its bony surface coming into contact with the adjoining portions of those bones. The second part of the movement con- sists of a hinge-like motion of the scaphoid round the os magnum contmued by a rotation of the same bone on a pivot formed by the head of the os magnum until it is checked by the tension of the ligaments uniting it to the trapezium and trapezoid. The third part is effected by the cuneiform which gHdes outwards or towards the radial side on the unciform to a certain extent and carries the semilunar vnth it so that it is disengaged from its contact with the os magnum and uiicitorm, ana undergoes a further separation from those bones towards the radial side. Flexion of the hand on the forearm, or palmar flexion, is accomphshed by the semilunar (with the cuneiform) hinging around the os magnum and unciform, and the scaphoid moving in the same sense until the movement is checked by these two bones coming together. -a Wo It follows from this that the movement of extension in thisjomt is considerable while that of flexion is but slight.* A very trifling rotation is permitted around the head of the os magnum as a pivot; but only to the extent which is deter- mined by the tension of the ligaments connected with that bone. 2 The articulation between the forearm and carpus is formed chiefly by the radius articulating with the scaphoid and semilunar, the articulation between tne triangular cartilage and cuneiform being of subordinate importance ^^^J'^^S^ which divides the two concave surfaces on the end of the radius is the centre ot motion in the chief part of the joint. This ridge is so inclined ^^ v^^^se^^^^^^ portion of a spiral Hue passing from the point of the styloid process of the ulna to the. ridge on the scaphoid which fits in between the trapezium and ^^^P^^^ result of this arrangement is that in flexion and extension of the hand it^ ramai border describes more of a curve than its ulnar, which moves more P^^^'^-f^^^ axis of the forearm. The ulnar border of the hand is also brought J^J^^ the middle line of the forearm than its ^adial-the memscus (carrjang the hand with it) is displaced towards the radial side in extension and ^^^f^^^^^^^^^ in flexion.

In abduction or radial flexion, the tubercle of the scaphoid glides towards the styloid process of the radius, carrying the meniscus towards the ulnar side, till its movement is stopped by the tension of the internal lateral ligament of the wrist, and by atmospheric pressure. The same traction which pulls the hand to the radial side, exerts, however, an influence on the transverse carpal joint which produces a movement of extension, or dorsi-flexion, and as the meniscus follows this movement to a slight extent, the tubercle of the scaphoid is disengaged to some degree from its contact with the styloid process of the radius, and the abduction can bo then carried a little further. From this it follows that any considerable abduction of the hand must also be combined with extension. The force which produces abduction Meyer regards as being usually the resultant of the action of the combined tendons of the Flexor carpi radialis and the two Extensores carpi radiales, passing through the posterior pai't of the axis of the scaphoid bone. Adduction, or ulnar flexion, of the hand is less opposed than abduction. In this movement, the semilunar is drawn across the ridge on the radius drawing with it the cuneiform along the face of the triangular fibro-cartilage. This movement does not tend to separate the scaphoid very much from the radius, since the curved surface formed by the end of the radius and its styloid process, is much the same in shape as the opposed sm-face of the scaphoid; consequently, the movement of adduction is much more extensive and uncomplicated than that of abduction. It is easily combined with flexion or extension, by preponderating actions of the Flexor or Extensor carpi ulnaris respectively, but extension is much more easily permitted than flexion. IX. Caepo-MetacArpal Articulations. 1. Articulation of the Metacarpal Bone op the Thumb with the Trapezium. This is an arthrodial joint, which enjoys great freedom of movement, on account of the configuration of its articular surfaces, which are saddle-shaped, so that, on section, each bone appears to be received into a cavity in the other, according to the direction in which they are cut. Hence this joint is sometimes described as one 'by reciprocal reception.' Its ligaments are a capsular and synovial membrane. _ The capsular ligament is a thick but loose capsule, which passes from ihe circumference of the upper extremity of the metacarpal bone to the rough ed^e boundmg the articular surface of the trapezium; it is thickest externally and Delimcl, and Imed by a separate synovial membrane. 2.

The digital extremities of the metacarpal bones are connected together by a narrow fibrous band, the transverse ligament (fig. 137) which passes transversely across their anterior surfaces, and is blended with the ligaments of the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations. Its anterior surface presents four grooves for the passage of the flexor tendons. Its posterior surface blends with the ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations. X. Metacarpo-phalangeal Articulations. (Fg. 137.) These articulations are of the ginglymus kind, formed by the reception of the rounded head of the metacarpal bone, into a superficial cavity in the extremity of the first phalanx. They are connected by the following ligaments :— Anterior. Two Lateral.

Each is placed on the palmar surface of the joint, in the interval between the late- ral ligaments, to which they are connected ; they are loose- ly united to the metacarpal bone, but very firmly to the Met<icaT^ff-jaJialaTtciud base of the first phalanges. Their palmar surface is in- timately blended with the transverse Kgament, forming a groove for the passage of the flexor tendons, the sheath, surrounding which is con- nected to each side of the groove. By their deep sur- face, they form part of the articular surface for the head of the metacarpal bone, and are lined by a synovial mem- brane. The Lateral Ligaments are strong rounded cords, placed one on eacli side of the joint, each, being attached by one extremity to the tubercle on the side of the head of the metacarpal bone, and 'by the other to the contiguous ex- tremity of the phalanx. The posterior ligament ia supplied by the extensor ten- don placed over the back of each joint. Adiom.

The ligaments of the joint are the Capulsar. ^-., Iliofemoral. Cotyloid. Transverse.HIP-JOINT. 189 The Gapmlar Ligament is a strong, dense, ligamentous capsule, embracing the margin of the acetabulum above, and surrounding the neck of the femur below. Its topper circumference is attached to the acetabulum two or three lines external to the cotyloid ligament; but opposite the notch where the margin of this cavity is deficient, it is connected with the transverse ligament, and by a few fibres to the edge of the obturator foramen. Its loioer circmnference surrounds the neck of the femur, being attached, in front, to the spiral or anterior intertrochanteric line ; above, to the base of the neck ; behind, to the middle of the neck of the bone, about half an inch above the posterior intertrochanteric line. It is much thicker at the upper and fore part of the joint where the greatest amount of resistance is required, than below, where it is thin, loose, and longer than in any other part. Its external surface (fig. 127) is rough, covered by numerous muscles, and sepa- rated in front from the Psoas and Iliacus by a synovial bursa, which not unfre- quently communicates by a circular aperture with the cavity of the joint. It differs from the capsular ligament of the shoulder, in being much less loose and lax, and in not being perforated for the passage of a tendon. The Hio-femoral Ligament (fig. J27) is an accessory band of fibres, extending obliquely across the front of the joint; it is intimately connected with the capsular ligament, and serves to strengthen it in this situation. It is attached, above, to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium; below, to the anterior intertrochanteric line. Its lower part is sometimes bifurcated, an arrangement which Bigelow seems to re-' gard as the usual one, so that be describes it under the name of ' the T-ligament' * The Ligamentum Teres is a triangular band of fibres, implanted, by its apex, into the depression a Little behind and below the centre of the head of the femur, and by its broad base, which consists of two bundles of fibres, into the margins of the notch at the bottom of the acetabulum, becoming blended witb the transverse ligament. It is formed of a bundle of fibres, the thickness and strength of which are very vainable, surrounded by a tubular sheath of synovial membrane. Some- times, only the synovial fold exists, or the ligament may be altogether absent. Th e use of the round ligament is to check rotation outwards, as well as adduction in the flexed position : it thus assists in preventing dislocation of the head of the femur forwards and outwards, an accident likely to occur from the necessary mechanism of the joint, if not provided against by this ligament and the thick anterior part of the capsule, f The Cotyloid Ligament is a fibre-cartilaginous rim attached to the margin of the acetabulum, the cavity of which it deepens ; at the same time-it protects the edges of the bone, and fills up the inequalities on its surface. It is prismoid in form, its base being attached to the margin of the acetabulum, and its opposite edge being free and sharp ; whilst its two surfaces are invested by synovial mem- brane, the external one being in contact with the capsular ligament, the internal one being inclined inwards so as to narrow the acetabulum and embrace the cartilaginous surface of the head of the femur. It is much thicker above and behind than below and in front, and consists of close compact fibres, which arise from different points of the circumference of the acetabulum, and interlace with each other at very acute angles. The Transverse Ligament is a strong flattened band of fibres, which crosses the notch at the lower part of the acetabulum, and converts it into a foramen. It is * Bigelow on the Hip-Joint. 7)r \^Qf TJ^^^TrT P'l^^^r' °f Eound Ligament of the Hip-Joint,' by assii.i f ^'^'''^fy^ .^^t" T^' ^^58.

The Synovial Mcinhrane is very extensive. Commencing at the margin of the cartilaginous siu'faco of the lioad of the femur, it covers all that portion of the neck which is contained within the joint; from the head it is reflected on the internal surface of the capsular ligament, covers both surfaces of the cotyloid ligament, and the mass of fat contained in the fossa at the bottom of the aceta- bulum, and is prolonged in the form of a tubular sheath around the ligamentum teres, as far as the head of the femur. The muscles in relation with the joint are, in front, the Psoas and Iliacus, separated from the capsulai" ligament by a synovial bursa ; above, the straight head of the Rectus and Gluteus minimus, the latter being closely adherent to the capsule ; internally, the Obturator externus and Pectineus ; behind, the Pyriformis Gemellus superior. Obturator internus, Gemellus inferior, Obturator externus, and Quadratus femoris. The arteries supplying the joint are derived from the obturator, sciatic, in- ternal circumflex and gluteal. The Nerves are articular branches from the sacral plexus, great sciatic, obtu- rator, and accessory obturator nerves. Actions. The movements of the hip, like all enarthrodial joints, are very extensive; they are, flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation. The hip-joint presents a very striking contrast to the other great enarthrodial joint—the shoulder—in the much more complete mechanical arrangements for its security and for the limitation of its motions. In the shoulder, as we have seen, the head of the humerus is not adapted at all in shape to the glenoid cavity, and is hardly restrained in any of its ordinary movements by the capsular ligament. In the hip-joint, on the contrary, the head of the femur is closely fitted to the acetabulum for a distance extending over nearly half a sphere, and at the margin of the bony cup it is still more closely embraced by the ligamentous ring of the cotyloid ligament, so that the head of the femur is held in its place by that ligament even when the fibres of the capsule have been quite divided (Humphry). The anterior por- tion of the capsule described as the ilio-femoral or accessory ligament, is the strongest of all the ligaments in the body, and is put on the stretch by any attempt to extend the femur beyond a straight line with the trunk. That is to say, this ligament is the chief agent in maintaining the erect position without muscular fatigue, the action of the extensor muscles of the buttock being balanced by the tension of the ilio-femoral and capsular ligaflaents. The security of the joint is also provided for by the two bones being directly united through the ligamentum teres. Flexion of the hip-joint is arrested by the soft parts of the thigh and abdomen being brought into contact; * extension by the tension of the ilio-femoral ligament and front of the capsule ; adduction by the upper part of the accessory ligament and of the capsule, and in the flexed position of the limb by the ligamentum teres ; abduction by the lower portion of the ilio-femoral ligament and of the capsule ; rotation outwards by the front part of the capsule, and the ligamentum teres, and rotation inwards by the back part of the capsule. II. Knee-Joint. The knee is a ginglymus, or hinge-joint; the bones entering into its formation are, the condyles of the femur above, the head of the tibia below, and the patella in front. The articular surfaces arc covered with cartilage, and connected to- gether by ligaments, some of which are placed on the exterior of the joint, whilst others occupy its interior. • The hip-joint cannot be completely flexed, in most pereons, without at the same time flexing the knee; on account of the shortness of tlie ham-string muscle?.

The strongest of these fasciculi is derived from the tendon of tlie Semi-membranosus, and passes from the back part of the innei- tuberosity of the tibia, obliquely upwards and outwards to the back part of the outer condyle of the foraur. The posterior ligament forms part of the floor of the popliteal space, and tho popliteal artery rests upon it. , , . The Internal Lateral Ligament is a broad, flat, membranous band, thicker behind than in front, and situated nearer to the liack than the front of the joint. It is attached, above, to tho inner tuberosity of the femur; below, to the inner tuberosity and inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, to the extent of about two inches. It is crossed, at its lower part, by the aponeurosis of the Sartorius, and the tendons of the Gracilis and Semiteudinosus muscles, a synovial bursa being interposed. Its deep surface covers the anterior portion of the tendon of the Semi, membranosus, the synovial membrane of the joint, and the inferior internal arti- cular artery and nerve ; it is intimately adherent to the internal semilunar fibro- cartdage. . The Long External Lateral Ligament is a strong, rounded, fibrous cord, situated nearer to the back than the front of the joint. It is attached, above, to the outer tuberosity of the femur ; below, to the outer part of the head of the fibula. Its outer surface is covered by the tendon of the Biceps, which divides at its insertion mto two parts, separated by the Hgament. The ligament has, passing beneath it, the tendon of the Popliteus muscle, and the inferior external articular vessels and 141.—Rig^it Knee-.Toint. nerve. The Short External Lateral Ligament is an accessory bundle of fibres, placed behind and parallel with the preceding ; attached, above, to the lower part of the outer tuberosity of the femur ; below, to the summit of the styloid process of the fibula. This ligament is intimately con- nected with the capsular ligament, and has, passing beneath it, the tendon of the Popliteus muscle. The Capsular Ligament consists of an exceedingly thin, but strong, fibrous membrane, which fills in the intervals left by the preceding ligaments. It is attached to the femur immediately above its articular surface ; below, to the upper border and sides of the patella and the margins of the head of the tibia and inter- articular cartilages, and is continuous behind with the posterior ligament. Tliis membrane is strengthened by fibrous ex- pansions, derived from the fascia lata, from the Vasti and Crureus muscles, and from the Biceps, Sartorius, and tendon of the Semimembranosus. The Orucinl are two interosseous liga- ments of considerable strength, situated in the interior of the joint, nearer its posterior than its anterior part. They are called crucial, because they cross eachi' other, somewhat like tho lines of the letter X; and have received the names ^ anterior and posterior, from tlie position of their attachment to the tibia. The Anterior or Bxtemal Crucial Ligament (fig. 14O. smaller than the posterior, ■ is attached to the inner side of the depression in front of the spine of the tibia, ^KNEE-JOINT. 193 being blended with the anterior extremity of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, and passing obliquely upwards, backwards, and outwards, is inserted into the inner and back part of the outer condyle of the femur. The Posterior or Internal Grucial Ligament is larger in size, but less oblique in its direction than the anterior. It is attached to the back part of the depression behind the spine of the tibia to the popliteal notch, and to the posterior extremity of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage ; and passes upwards, forwards, and in- wards, to be inserted into the outer and fore-part of the inner condyle of the femur. As it crosses the anterior crucial ligament, a fasciculus is given off from it, which blends with the posterior part of that ligament. It is in relation, in front, with the anterior crucial ligament; behind, with the ligamentum posticum Winslowii. The Semilunar Fibro-Gartilages (fig. 142) are two CTescentic lamellae, which are attached to the margins of the head of the tibia, and serve to deepen its surface for articulation with the condyles of the femur. The circumference of each cartilage is thick and I42.-Head of Tibia, with Semilunar Cartilages, etc. convex; the inner free been from above. Kis-ht Side. , -, ,, . -, border, thm and concave. Their upper surfaces are concave, and in relation with the condyles of the femur; their lower sur- faces are flat, and rest upon the head of the tibia. Each cartilage covers nearly the outer two-thirds of the corresponding articular surface of the tibia, leav- ing the inner third unco- vered ; both surfaces are smooth, and invested by synovial membrane. The Internal Semihmar Fihro-Cartilage is nearly semicircular in form, a little elongated from before backwards, and broader behind than in front; its convex border is united to the internal lateral ligament, and to the head of the tibia, by means of the coronary ligaments; its anterior extremity, thin and pointed, is firmly implanted into a depression in front of the inner articular surface of the tibia; its posterior extremity into the depression behind the spine, between the attachment of the external cartilage and posterior crucial ligament. The External Semihmar Fibro-Cartilage forms nearly an entire circle, covering a larger portion of the articular surface than the internal one. It is grooved on its outer side, for the tendon of the Popliteus muscle. Its circumference is held in connection with the head of the tibia, by means of the coronary ligaments ; and its two extremities are firmly implanted in the depressions in front and behind the spine of the tibia. These extremities, at their insertion, are interposed between the attachments of the internal cartilage. The external semilunar fibro-cartilage gives ofi from Its anterior border a fasciculus, which forms the transverse ligament By ^ts anterior extremity, it is continuous with the anterior crucial ligament.

Rotation outwards (or supination) is checked by the posterior crucial ligament. It is effected mainly by the Biceps. The main function of the crucial ligaments is to act as a dii-ect bond of union between the tibia and femur, preventing the former bone from being carried too far backwards or forwards. They also assist the lateral ligaments in resisting any lateral bending of the joint. The interai'ticular cartilages are intended, as it seems, to adapt the surface of the tibia to the shape of the femur to a certain extent, so as to fill up the intervals which would otherwise be left in the varying positions of the joint, and to interrupt the jars which would be so frequently transmitted up the limb in jumping or falls on the feet. The patella is a great defence to the knee-joint from any injury in- flicted in front, and it distributes upon a large and tolerably even surface during kneeling the pressure which would otherwise fall upon the prominent ridges of the condyles : it also affords leverage to the Quadriceps extensor muscle to act upon the tibia, and Mr. Wai-d has pointed out * how this leverage varies in the various positions of the joint, so that the action of the muscle produces velocity at the ex- pense of force in the commencement of extension, and on the contrary, at the close of extension tends to diminish the velocity, and therefore the shock to the ligaments; whilst in the standing position it draws the tibia powerfully forwards, and thus maintains it in its place. The folds of synovial membrane and the fatty processes contained in them act, as it seems, mainly as padding to fill up interspaces and obviate concussions. The bursas in connection with the synovial membrane will be found described in connection with the regional anatomy of the popliteal space. ni. Articulations between the Tibia and Fibula. The articulations between the tibia and fibula are effected by ligaments which connect both extremities, as well as the shafts of the bone. They may, con- sequently, be subdivided into three sets :—i. The Superior Tibio-Fibular articula- tion. 2. The Middle Tibio-Fibular articulation. 3. The Inferior Tibio-Fibular articulation. 1. SuPERiOB Tibio-Fibular Articulation. This articulation is an arthrodial joint. The contiguous surfaces of the bones present two flat oval surfaces covered with cartilage, and connected together by the following ligaments :— * Anterior Superior Tibio-Fibular. Posterior Superior Tibio-Fibular. The Anterior Superior Ligament (fig. 141) consists of two or three broad and flat bands, which pass obliquely upwards and inwards from the head of the fibula to the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The Posterior Superior Ugament is a single thick and broad band, which passes from the back part of the head of the fibula to the back part of the outer tuberosity of the tibia. It IS covered by the tendon of the Popliteus muscle. _ A Synovial Membrane lines this articulation, which at its upper and back part is occasionally continuous with that of the knee-joint. 2. Middle Tibio-Fibular Articulation. An interosseous membrane extends between the contiguous margins of the tibia and fibula, and separates the muscles on the front from those on the back of the leg. It consists of a thin aponeurotic lamina composed of oblique fibres, which pass between the interosseous ridges on the two bones. It is broader above than below, and presents at its upper part a large oval aperture for the passage of tlie • ' Human Osteology, p. 405, 02196 ARTICULATIONS. anterior tibial artery forwards to the anterior aspect of the leg; and at its lower part an openino- for the passage of tbe anterior peroneal vessels It is contmaous t 1 -K 7x ■ f • • +«.n««Pnn8 ligament; and is perforated in numerous parts below with the inferior interosseous iiganiuuL, i fi^n nMhiilk nnHmiK n ,1 e „n rr^aaola Tf is in relation m front with the iibiaiis anticut,, for the passage of small vob.c , It ib i ^ ^^^^^^ ^ Extensor longus ^Y'ZrnlTTehKd^y^ith the Tibialis posticus and Flexor anterior tibial vessels ana neive , uumuu, r longus poUicis. 3.

The Inferior Interosseous Ligament consists of numerous short strong fibrous bands, which pass between the contiguous rough surfaces of the txbia and fibula, and constitute the chief bond of union between the bones. This hgament is con- tinuous above, with the interosseous membrane. . ^ nu S Interior Inferior Ligament (fig. 144) is a flat, triangular band of fibre^ broader below than above, which extends obliquely downwards and outwa ds between the adjacent margins of the tibia and fibula on the front aspect of the artiirtion li is in relatln, in front, with the Peroneus tertius, the aponeurosis of the leg, and the integument; behind, with the inferior interosseous ligament; and lies in contact with the cartilage covering the astragalus _ The Posterior Inferior Ligament, smaller than the preceding, is disposed m a similar manner on the posterior surfate of the articulation.

The siopcrftcial layer is a strong, flat, triangular band, attached, above, to the apex and anterior and posterior borders of the inner malleolus. The most anterior fibres pass forwai'ds to be inserted into the scaphoid; the middle descend almost perpendicularly to be inserted into the os calcis ; and the posterior fibres pass backwards and outwards to be attached to the inner side of the astragalus. The deeper layer consists of a short, thick, and strong fasciculus, which passes 143.—Ankle-Joint: Tarsal and Tarso-Metatarsal Articulations. Internal View. Eight Side. from the apex of the malleolus to the inner surface of the astragalus, below the articular surface. This ligament is covered by the tendons of the Tibialis posticus and Mexor longus digitorum muscles. The External Lateral Ligament (flg. 144) consists of three fasciouli, taking different directions, and separated by distinct intervals; for which reason it is described by some anatomists as three distinct ligaments.* This would seem the preferable description, were it not that the old nomenclature has passed into general use. The anterior fasciculus, the shortest of the three, passes from the anterior margin of the summit of the external malleolus, downwards and forwards, to the astragalus, ia front of its external articular facet. The posterior fasciculus, the most deeply seated, passes from the depression at the inner and back part of the external malleolus to the astragalus, behind its ex. temal malleolar facet. Its fibres are almost horizontal in direction. The middle fasciculus, the longest of the three, is a narrow rounded cord, passing from the apex of the external malleolus downwards and slightly backwards to the middle of the outer side of the os calcis. It is covered by the tendons of the Peroneus longus and brevis. There is no posterior ligament, its place being supplied by the transverse liga- ment of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation. The Synovial Membrane invests the inner surface of the ligaments, and sends a duplicature upwards between the lower extremities of the tibia and fibula for a short distance. • HuMPHRy, on The Skeleton, p. 559.ARTICULATIONS.

The posterior portion of the external lateral ligament assists the middle portion in resisting the dis- placement of the foot backwards, and deepens the cavity for the reception of the astragalus. The anterior fasciculus is a security against the displacement of the foot forwards, and limits extension of the joint. The movements of abduction and adduction of the foot, together with the minute changes in form by which it is applied to the ground or takes hold of an object in climbing, &c., are effected in the tarsal joints; the one which enjoys the greatest amount of motion being that between the astragalus and os calcis behind, and the scaphoid and cuboid in front. This is often called the transverse tarsal joint, and it, with the subordinate joints of the tarsus, can replace the ankle-joint in a. great measure when the latter has become ankylosed. V. Aeticulations op the Taesus. These articulations may be subdivided into three sets :—i. The articulations of the first row of tai-sal bones. 2. The articulations of the second row of tarsal bones. 3. The articulations of the two rows with each other. I. Articulations op the First Row op Tarsal Bones. The articulations between the astragalus and os calcis are two in number anterior and posterior. They are arthrodial joints. The bones are connected together by three ligaments External Calcaneo-Astragaloid, Posterior Calcaneo-Astragaloid. Interosseous. The External Calcaneo-Astragaloid Ligament (fig. 144) is a short strong fasci- culus, passing from the outer surface of the astragalus, immediately beneath its external malleolar facet, to the outer edgp of the os calcis. It is placed in front of the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint, with the fibres of which it is parallel. The Posterior Calcaneo-Astragaloid Ligament (fig. 143) connects the posterior extremity of the astragalus with the upper contiguous surface of the os calcis; it is a short narrow band, the fibres of which are directed obliquely backwards and inwards. The Interosseous Ligament forms the ohief bond of union between the bones. It consists of numerous vertical and obHque fibres, attached by one extremity to^ the groove between the articulating surfaces of the astragalus ; by the other, to a corresponding depression on the upper surface of the os calcis. It is very thick and strong, being at least an inch in breadth from side to side, and serves to unite the OS calcis and astragalus solidly together. The Synovial Memlrames (fig. 146) are two in number: one for the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation; a second for the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint. The latter synovial membrane is continued forwards between the contiguous 8urfe,ces of the astragalus and scaphoid bones. 2, Aeticulations of the Second Row op Tarsal Bones, ■ The articulations between the scaphoid, cuboid, and three cuneiform are efiected by the following ligaments :— ^ovs&\. Plantar, Interosseous. The Ihrml Ligaments are small bands of parallel fibres, which pass from each bone to the neighbouring bones with which it articulates. . The Pkintar Ligaments have the same arrangement on the plantar surface. Ihe Literosseom Ligaments are four in number. They consist of strong trans-200 AETICULATIONS. verse fibres, which pass between the rough non-articular surfaces of adjoining bones. There is one between the sides of the scaphoid and caboid; a second between the internal and middle cuneiform bones ; a third between the middle and external cuneiform ; and a fourth between the external canoiform and cuboid. The scaphoid and cuboii, when in contact, present each a small articulatmg facet, covered with cartilage, and lined either by a separate synovial membrane, or by an olfset fiom the great tarsal synovial membrane. 3. Abticuiations op the Two Rows OP The Tabsos with each othee. Dorsal, Plantar. These may be conveniently divided into three sets. The joint between the os calcis and the cuboid.

The Superior GalcanecGuloid Liga- 145.-Ligamentsj)f^Pkntar Surface of ment (fig. 144) is a thin and narrow fas- ciculus, which passes between the con- tiguous surfaces of the OS calcis and cuboid, on the dorsal surface of the joint. The Internal Galcaneo-Guhoid (Inter- osseous) Ligament (fig. 144) is a short, but thick and strong, band of fibres, arising from the os calcis, in the deep groove which intervenes between it and the astragalus ; and closely blended, at its origin, with the superior calcaneo- scaphoid ligament. It is inserted into the inner side of the cuboid bone. This ligament forms one of the chief bonds of union between the first and second row of the tarsus. The Lo7ig Gahaneo-Guboid (fig. 145), the more superficial of the two plantar ligaments, is the longest of all the liga- ments of the tarsus ; it is attached to the under surface of the os calcis, from near the tuberosities, as far forwards as the anterior tubercle ; its fibres pass forwards to be attached to the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone, the more su- perficial fibres being continued onwards to the basis of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. This ligament crosses the groove on the under^ surface of the cuboid bone, converting it into a canal for the passage of the tendon of the Peroneus longus. , „„^;ntr The Short Galcaneo-Guhoid Ligament lies nearer to the bones than the P^^^'^^^^S' from which it is separated by a little areolar adipose tissue. It is ^^^^^^'^^J^ broad, about an inch in length, and extends from the tubercle and ^^e dcFe^^^^ in front of it on the fore part of the under surface of the os calcis, to the mterioOF THE TARSUS. 20I snrface of the cuboid bono behind the peroneal groove. A separate synovial mem- brane is found in the calcaneo-cuboid articulation. The ligaments connecting the os calcis with the scaphoid are two in number :— Superior Calcaneo-Scaphoid. Inferior Calcaneo-Scaphoid. The SicjoenorCalcaneo-8cajphoid(&g. 144) arises, as already mentioned, with the internal calcaneo-cuboid in the deep groove between the astragalus and os calcis ; it passes forwards from the inner side of the anterior extremity of the os calcis to the outer side of the scaphoid bone. These two ligaments resemble the letter Y, being blended together behind, but separated in front. The Inferior Calca7ieo-Scaphoid (fig. 145) is by far the larger and stronger of the two ligaments of this articulation; it is a broad and thick band of fibres, which passes forwards and inwards from the anterior and inner extremity of the os calcis to the under surface of the scaphoid bone. This ligament not only serves to con- nect the OS calcis and scaphoid, but supports the head of the astragalus, forming part of the articular cavity in which it is received. The upper surface is lined by the synovial membrane continued from the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articula- tion. Its under surface is in contact with the tendon of the Tibialis posticus muscle.* The ai'ticulation between the astragalus and scaphoid is an arthrodial joint; the rounded head of the astragalus being received into the concavity formed by thepos- 146.—Oblique Section of the Articulations of the Tarsus and Metatarsus.

The only ligament of this joint is the superior astragalo-scaphoid, a broad band, which passes obliquely forwards from the neck of the astragalus to the superior surface of the scaphoid bone. It is thin and weak in texture and covered by the Extensor tendons. The inferior calcaneo-scaphoid Buppnea the place of an mferior hgament. _The Synovial ifem&rane which lines the joint is continued forwards from the mot^X' w 'Jf This articulation permits of considerable ^tagllus '° occasionally of dislocation of the fourTn\?T^^ ilfemirme.

The prolongation which lines the metatarsal bones passes forwards between the external and middle cuneiform bones. A small synovial membrane is sometimes found between the contiguous surfaces of the scaphoid and cuboid bones. ■ Actions The movements permitted between the bones of the first row, the astrao-alus 'and os calcis, are limited to a gliding upon each other from before backwards and from side to side. The gliding movement which takes place between the bones of the second row is very slight, the articulation between the scaphoid and cuneiform bones being more moveable than those of the cuneiform with each other and with the cuboid. The movement which takes place between the two rows is more extensive, and consists in a sort of rotation, by means of which the sole of the foot may be slightly flexed, and extended, or carried inwards and outwards. i.' VI. Tarso-Metataksal Articulations. ' These are arthrodial joints. The bones entering into their formation are four tarsal bones, viz., the internal, middle and external cuneiform, and the cuboid, which articulate with the metatarsal bones of the five toes. The metatarsal bone of the great toe articulates with the internal cuneiform; that of the second is deeply wedged in between the internal and external cuneiform resting agamst the middle cuneiform, and being the most strongly articulated of all the metatarsal bones ; the third metatarsal articulates with the extremity of the external cunei- form • the fourth with the cuboid and external cuneiform; and the fitth witli the cuboid. The articular surfaces are covered with cartilage, Imed by synovial membrane, and connected together by the following ligaments :— Dorsal. Plantar. Interosseous. The Dorsal Ligaments consist of strong, flat, fibrous bands, which connect the tarsal with the metatarsal bones. The first metatarsal is connected to the mtei-nal cuneiform by a single broad, thin, fibrous band; the second has three dor.sa ligaments, one from each cuneiform bone; the third has one from the external cuneiform: and the fourth and fifth have one each from the cuboid. The Plantar Ligaments consist of longitudinal and oblique fibrous bands con- necting the tarsal and metatarsal bones, but disposed with less regularity than on the dorsal surface. Those for the first and second metatarsal are the most strongly marked : the second and third metatarsal receive strong fibrous bands, which pass obliquely across from the internal cuneiform ; the plantar ligaments of the fourth and fifth metatarsal consist of a few scanty fibres derived from tlie cuboid. The Interosseous Ligaments are three in number : internal, middle, and external. The internal one passes from the outer extremity of the internal cuneiform to the adiacent angle of the second metatarsal. The middle one, less strong than the prfceding, connects the external cuneiform with the adjacent angle of the second metatarsal. The external interosseous ligament connects the outer angle ot the external cuneiform with the adjacent side of the third metatarsal. The Synovial Membranes of these articulations are three m number: one tor tue metatarsal bone of the great toe, with the internal cuneiform; one for the second and third metatarsal bones, with the middle and external cuneiform ; this is a par o?the great tarsal synovial membrane; and one for the fourth and fifth metatai al bones with the cuboid. The synovial membranes of th. tarsus and metatarsus aio thus seen to be six in number (fig. 146).203 OP THE PHALANGES. ArTICULATIOKS of the M.TATAKSA. BONES WITH EACH OTHER.

The movement permitted in the tarsal ends of the metatarsal bones is limited to a slight ghding of the articular surfaces upon one another ; consideraDie motion, however, takes place in the digital extremities.

Their arrangement is precisely similar to the corresponding parts in the hand. The expansion of the Extensor tendon supplies the place of a dorsal ligament. Actions. The movements permitted in the metatarso-phalangeal articulations are flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. VIII. AeTICULATIONS of THE PHALANGES. The hgaments of these articulations are similar to those found in the hand ; each pair of phalanges being connected by a plantar and two lateral ligaments, and their articular surfaces lined by synovial membrane. Their actions are also similar.

Du Bois Ileymond's Arcfiiv,The Muscles and Fasciee* THE Muscles are connected with the bones, cartilages, ligaments and skin, either directly or through the intervention of fibrous structures, called tendons or aponeuroses. Where a muscle is attached to bone or cartilage, the fibres terminate in blunt extremities upon the periosteum or perichondrium, and do not come into direct relation with the osseous or cartilaginous tissue. Where muscles are con- nected with the skin, they either He as a flattened layer beneath it, or are connected with its areolar tissue by larger or smaller bundles of fibres', as in the muscles of the face. The muscles vary extremely in their form. In the limbs, they are ot con- siderable length, especially the more superficial ones, the deep ones being generally broad; they surround the bones, and form an important protection to the various joints.' In the trunk, they are broad, flattened, and expanded, forming the parietes of the cavities which they enclose ; hence, the reason of the terms, long, hroad, short, etc., used in the description of a muscle. There is a considerable variation in the arrangement of the fibres of certam muscles with reference to the tendons to which they are attached. In some, the fibres are arranged longitudinally, and terminate at either end in a narrow tendon If the fibres converge, like the plumes of a pen, to one side of a tendon, which runs the entire length of a muscle, the muscle is said to be penmform, as the Peronei; if they converge to both sides of the tendon, the muscle is caUed Upenniform, as the Hectus femoris; if they converge from a broad surface to a narrow tendinous point, the muscle is said to be radiated, as the Temporal and Glutei muscles. ^ i • <? i. n c 4.i,„ They difi-er no less in size ; the Gastrocnemius forms the chief bulk ot the back of the leg, and the fibres of the Sartorius. are nearly two feet m length whilst the Stapedius, a small muscle of the internal ear, weighs about a gram, and its fibres are not more than two lines in length. -, . , o +1, • The names applied to the various muscles have been derived: i, fi'om their situation, as the Tibialis, Radiahs, Ulnaris, Peroneus ; 2, from their du-ection, as the Rectus abdomiuis, Obliqui capitis, Transversalis ; 3, from their uses, as Flexors, Extensors, Abductors, etc. ; 4, from their shape, as the Deltoid Trapezius, Rhom- boideus ; 5, from the number of their divisions, as the Biceps, the Triceps ; 6 fi-om their points of attachment, as the Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Stemo-hyoid, Sterno- ti'the description of a muscle, the term oHgin is meant to imply its more fixed or central attachment; and the tevm insertion the moveable point to which the force of the muscle is directed; but the origin is absolutely fixed m only a very small number of muscles, such as those of the face, which are attached by one extremity to the bone, and by the other to the moveable integument; m the greater number, the muscle can be made to act from either extremity. * The Muscles and Fascife are described conjointly, in order that sidfir the arrangement of the latter in his dissection of the former It is ^^^^5^^ JP" Sudent of ratomy in this country to have the opportunity ^'^^-^^ ^tiwTen f.mratelY • and it is for this reason, as well as from the close connection that exi ta between rmSl^s'and their investing aponem-oses, that ^1^7-^3^^^^^^^^^^^ speS creneral observations are first made on the anatoiuy of the muscles antt lasciiB, w y description being given in connection with the diflerent regions.GENERAL DESCRIPTION. 205 T XI, J- .-^r. nf +hfl muscles the student should pay especial attention to In the dissection of the ^^^"^^ 1, its more important relations the exact origia, Man, ^nd. actions fj^Le of the points of attachment of with surrounding parts. _ An accurate ^^^^^^ their action.

The relations, also, of some of the ™f^'^'^^^^^^^ they immediate apposition with the larger blood-vessels, and the Tf^^^'."^^^^^^^ produce, should be especially remembered, as they form useful guides in the ap plication of a ligature to those vessels. . . , .1, j fhiVk Tendons are white, glistening, fibrous cords, varying m ^^^S^^;^/^"^^^^^^ ness, sometimes round, sometimes flattened, of considerable strength, slightly elastic. They consist almost entirely of ^^^^^^^ fibrous of which have an undulating course parallel with each other and are S^^l^ ^^^^^^^^^ together. They are very sparingly supplied with blood-vessels, the smaller tendons presenting in their interior not a trace of them. Nerves also are not present in the smaller tendons ; but the larger ones, as the tendo AchiUis, receive nerves which accompany the nutrient vessels. The tendons consist prmcipally ot a substance which yields gelatine. _ Aponeuroses are fibrous membranes, of a pearly-white colour, iridescent, glistening, and similar in structure to the tendons. They are destitute of nerves, and the thicker ones only sparingly supplied with blood-vessels. The tendons and aponeuroses are connected, on the one hand, with the muscles; and on the other hand, with the moveable structures, as the bones, cartilages, ligaments, fibrous membranes (for instance, the sclerotic), and the synovial mem- branes (subcrur^eus, subanconeus). Where the muscular fibres are in a direct line with those of the tendon or aponeurosis, the two are directly continuous, the muscular fibre being distinguishable from that of the tendon only by its striation. But where the muscular fibre joins the tendon or aponeurosis at an obhque_ angle, the former terminates, according to KoUiker, in rounded extremities, which are received into corresponding depressions on the surface of the latter, the connective tissue between the fibres being continuous with that of the tendon. The latter mode of attachment occurs in all the penniform and bipenniform muscles, and m those muscles the tendons of which commence in a membranous form, as the Gastrocnemius and Soleus. The fascise (fascia, a bandage) are fibro-areolar or aponeurotic laminse, of variable thickness and strength, found in all regions of the body, investing the softer and more dehcate organs. The fasciae have been subdivided, from the structure which they present, into two groups, fibro-areolar or superficial fascia, and aponeurotic or deep fasciae. The fihro-areolar fascia is found immediately beneath the integument over almost the entire surface of the body, and is generally known as the superficial fascia. It connects the skin with the deep or aponeurotic fascia, and consists of fibro-areolar tissue, containing in its meshes pellicles of fat in varying quantity. In the eyelids and scrotum, where adipose tissue is rarely deposited, this tissue is very Hable to serous infiltration. The superficial fascia varies in thickness in differ- ent parts of the body: in the groin it is so thick as to be capable of being subdi- vided into several laminae, but in the palm of the hand it is of extreme thinness, and intimately adherent to the integument. The superficial fascia is capable of separa- tion into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves, and superficial lymphatic glands ; as the superficial epigastric vessels in the abdominal region, the radial and ulnar veins in the forearm, the saphenous veins m the leg and thigh; certain cutaneous muscles also are situated in the superficial fascia, as the Platysma myoides in the neck, and the Orbicularis palpebrarum around the eyelids. This fascia is most distinct at the lower part of the abdomen, the scro- tum, perincoum, and extremities; is very thin in those regions where muscular206 MUSCLES AND FASCLE. fibres are inserted into the integument, as on the side of the neck, the face, and around the margin of the anus; and is almost entirely wanting in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, where the integument is adherent to the subjacent aponeurosis. The superficial fascia connects the skin to the subjacent parts, facili- tates the movement of the skin, serves as a soft nidus for the passage of vessels and nerves to the integument, and retains the warmth of the body, smce the adapose tissue contained in its areolas is a bad conductor of caloric. The aponeurotic or deep fascia is a dense inelastic unyielding fibrous mem- brane forming sheaths for the muscles, and affording them broad surfaces for attachment. It consists of shining tendinous fibres, placed parallel with one another, and connected together by other fibres disposed in a reticular manner. It is usually exposed on the removal of the superficial fascia, forming a strong investment, which not only binds down collectively the muscles in each region, but gives a separate sheath to each, as well as to the vessels and nerves. The fescite are thick in unprotected situations, as on the outer side of a limb, and thinner on the inner side. Aponeurotic fasciae are divided into two classes, aponeuroses of insertion, and aponeuroses of investment. The aponeuroses of insertion serve for the insertion of muscles. Some of these are formed by the expansion of, a tendon into an aponeurosis, as, for instance, the tendon of the Sartorius ; others are connected directly to the muscle, as the aponeuroses of the abdomiual muscles. The aponeuroses of investment form a sheath for the entire limb, as well as for each individual muscle. Many aponeuroses, however, serve both for investment and in- sertion Thus the aponeurosis given oS" from the tendon of the Biceps of the arm near its insertion is continuous with, and partly forms, the investmg fascia of the forearm and gives origin to the muscles in this region. The deep fascias assist the muscles'in their action, by the degree of tension and pressure they make upon their surface- and, in certain situations, this is increased and regulated by muscular action, as, for instance, by the Tensor vaginas femoris and Gluteus maximus in the thiffh by the Biceps in the leg, and Palmaris longus m the hand. In the limbs, the fasdae not only invest the entire limb, but give off septa, which separate the various muscles, and are attached beneath to the periosteum : these prolongations of fascise are usually spoken of as intermuscular septa. The Muscles and Tascise may be arranged, according to the general division of the body, into those of the cranium, face, and neck; those of the trunk; those of the upper extremity ; and those of the lower extremity. MUSCLES AND EASCI^ OF THE CRANIUM AND FACE. The muscles of the Cranium and Face consist of ten groups, arranged according to the region in which they are situated. 1. Cranial Region. 2. Auricular Region 3. Palpebral Region, 4. Orbital Region. 5. Nasal Region. 6. 7. 8, 9- 10. Superior Maxillary Region. Inferior Maxillary Region. Intermaxillary Region. Temporo-Maxillary Region. Pterygo-Maxillary Region. The muscles contained in each of these groups are the following :- I. Cramal Eegion. Occipito-frontalis. 2. Auricular Eegion. Attollens aurem. Attrahens aurem- Retrahens aurem. 3. Palpebral Eegion. Orbiculai-is palpebrarum. Con-ugator supercilii. Tensor Tarsi. 4. Orlital Eegion. Levator palpobroe.

Raise the skin in front from the subjacent muscle from below upwards; this must be done with extreme care, removing the integument from the outer surface of the vessels and the nerves which lie between the two. The superficial fascia is the cranial region in a firm, dense layer, intimately adherent to the integument, and to the Occipito-frontalis and its tendinous aponeu- rosis ; it is continuous, behind, with the superficial fascia at the back part of the neck; and, laterally, is continued over the temporal aponeurosis: it contains2o8 MUSCLES AND FASCIA. botweon its layora tho small muscles of the auricle, and the superficial temporal vessels and superficial nerves.

Its middle fibres become blended with the Corrugator suporcilii and Orbicularis: and the outer fibres are also blended with the latter muscle over the external angular process. _ From this attachment, the fibres are directed upwards and join the aponeurosis below the coronal sutm-e. The inner margins of the two frontal portions of the muscles are joined together for some distance above the root of the nose; but between the occipital portions there is a considerable though variable interval. The aponei^rosis covers the upper part of the vertex of the skull, being con- tinuous across the middle line with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle Behind, it is attached, in the interval between the occipital origins, to the occipital protuberance and superior curved lines above the attachment of the Trapezius ; m front, it forms a short angular prolongation between the frontal portions ; and on each side, it has connected with it the Attollens and Attrahens aurem muscles ; in this situation it loses its aponeurotic character, and is continued oyer the temporal fascia to the zygoma by a layer of laminated areolar tissue. This aponeurosis is closely connected to the integument by a dense fibro-cellular tissue, which contains much granular fat, and in which ramify the numerous vessels and nerves of the integument; it is loosely connected with the pericranium by a quantity of loose cellular tissue, which allows of a considerable degree of movement of the integument. Nei-ves. The frontal portion of the Occipito-frontalis is supplied by the facial nerve ; its occipital portion by the posterior auricular branch of the facial, and sometimes by the occipitalis minor. Actions. The frontal portion of the muscle raises the eyebrows and the sldn over the root of the nose ; at the same time throwing the integument of the fore- head into transverse wrinkles, a predominant expression in the emotions of delight. By bringing alternately into action the occipital and frontal portions, the entire scalp may be moved from before backwards. 2. AuEicuLAR Region. (Fig. 148.) Attollens Aurem. Attrahens Aurem. Retrahens Aurem, These three small muscles are placed immediately beneath the skin around the external ear. In man, in whom the external ear is almost immoveable, they are rudimentary. They are the analogues of large and important muscles in some of the mammalia. Dissection. This requires considerable care, and should be performed in the following manner:—To expose the Attollens aurem; draw the pinna or broad part of the ear down- wards, -when a tense band will be felt beneath the skin, passing from the side of the head to the upper part of the concha; by dividing the sldu over the tendon, in a direction from below upwards, and then reflecting it on each side, the muscle is exposed. To bring into view the Attrahens aurem, draw the helix backwards.by means of a hook, when the muscle will be made tense, and may be exposed in a similar manner to the preceding. To expose the Ketrahens aurem, draw the pinna forwards, when the muscle being made tense may be felt beneath the skin, at its insertion into the back part of the concha, and may be exposed in the same manner as the other muscles. The Attollens Aurem, the largest of the three, is thin, and fan-shaped : its fibres arise from the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, and converge to be in- serted by a thin, flattened tendon into the upper part of the cranial surface of . the pinna. Eelations. Externally, with the integument; internally, with the temporal aponeurosis. The Attrahens Aurem, the smallest of the three, is thin, fan-shaped, and its fibres pale and indistinct; they arise, from the lateral edge of the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, and converge to be inserted into a projection on the front of the helix.

By its anterior surface, with the Occipito-fronta is and Orbicularis palpebrarum muscles. By its jjosteHor surface, with the frontal bone and supra- ti'ochlear nerve. i i The Levator Falpelrm will be described with the muscles of the orbital region. The Temor Tarsi is a small thin muscle, about three lines m breadth and six m length, situated at the inner side of the orbit, behind the tendo oculi. It arises from the crest and adjacent part of the orbital surface of the lachrymal bone, and passing across the lachrymal sac, divides into two sHps, which cover the lachrymal canals, and are inserted into the tarsal cartilages near the puncta lachrymaha. Its fibres appear to be continuous with those of the palpebral portion of the Orbi- cularis ; it is occasionally very indistinct. Nerves. The Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii, and Tensor tarsi are supplied by the facial nerve. Actions. The Orbicularis palpebrarum is the sphincter muscle of the eyelids. The palpebral portion acts involuntarily in closing the lida, and independently of the orbicular portion, which is subject to the will. When the entire muscle is brought into action, the integument of the forehead, temple, and cheek is drawn inwards towards the inner angle of the eye, and the eyelids are firmly closed. The Levator palpebrfB is the direct antagonist of this muscle ; it raises the npper eyelid and exposes the globe. The Corrugator supercilii draws the eyebrow downwards and inwards, producing the vertical wrinkles of the forehead. This muscle may be regarded as the principal agent in .the expression of grief. The Tensor tarsi draws the eyelids and the extremities of the lachrymal canals inwards, and compresses them against the surface of the globe of the eye ; thus placing them in the most favourable situation for receiving the tears. It serves, also, to compress the lachrymal sac. 4. Oebital Region. (Fig. 149.) Levator Palpebrse Superioris. Rectus Interntis. Rectus Superior. Rectus Externns. Rectus Inferior. Obliqnus Superior. Obliquus Inferior. Dissection. To open the cavity of the orbit, remove the skull-cap and brain; then saw through the frontal bone at the inner extremity of the supraorbital ridge, and externally at its junction with the malar. Break in pieces the thin roof of the orbit by a few slight blows of the hammer, and take it away; drive forward the superciliary portion of the frontal bone by a smart stroke, but do not remove it, as that would destroy the pulley of the Obliquus superior. When the fragments are cleared away, the periosteum of the orbit will be exposed; this being removed, together with the fat which fills the cavity of the orbit, the several muscles of this region can be examined. The dissection will be facihtated by distending the globe of the eye. In order to eff'ect this, puncture the optic nerve near the eyeball, with a curved needle, and push the needle onwards into the globe ; insert the point of a blow-pipe through this aperture, and force a little air into the cavity of the eyeball; then apply a ligature round the nerve, so as to prevent the air escaping. The globe being now drawn forwards, the muscles will be put upon the stretch. The Levator Palpehrm Sioperioris is thin, flat, and triangular in shape. It arises from the under surface of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, immediately in front of the optic foramen ; and is inserted, by a broad aponeurosis, into the upper border of the superior tarsal cartilage. At its origin, it is narrow and tendinous ; but soon becomes broad and fleshy, and finally terminates in a broad aponeurosis. Relations. By its up2Jer surface, with the frontal nerve and artery, the peri- osteum of the orbit; and, in front, with the inner surface of the broad tarsal hgament. By its under surface, with the Superior rectus ; and in the Hd, with the conjunctiva. A small branch of the third nerve enters its under surface. r 2212 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. Tho Jleclus superior, the thinnest and narrowest of the four Recti, arises from the tipper margin of the optic foramen, beneath the Levator Palpebras and Superior obhque, and from the fibrous sheath of tho optic nerve ; and is inserted, by a ten- 149.—Muscles of tlio Rijrlit Orbif. dinous expansion, into the sclerotic coat, about three or four lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations. By its upper surface, with the Levator Palpebrse. By its under surface, with the optic nerve, the ophthalmic artery, the nasal nerve, and the branch of the third nerve, which supplies it; and, in front, with the tendon of the Superior oblique, and the globe of the eye. The Inferior and Internal Recti arise by a common tendon (the ligament of Zinn), which is attached round the circumference of the optic foramen, except at its upper and outer part. The External rectiis has two heads : the upper one arises fi'om the outer margin of the optic foi^amen immediately beneath the Superior rectus ; the lower head, partly from the ligament of Zinn, and partly from a small pointed process of bone on the lower margin of the sphenoidal fissure. Each muscle passes forward in the position implied by its name, to be inserted, by a tendinous ex- pansion (the timica albuginea), into the sclerotic coat, about three or four lines from the margin of the cornea. Between the two heads of the External rectus is a narrow interval, through which pass the third, nasal branch of the fifth, and sixth nerves, and the oi3hthalmic vein. Although nearly all these muscles present a common origin, and are inserted in a similar manner in the sclerotic coat, there are certain differences to be observed in them, as regards their length and breadth. The Internal Rectus is the broadest; the External, the longest; and the Superior, the thinnest and narrowest. The Superior Oblique is a fusiform muscle, placed at the upper and inner side of the orbit, internal to the Levator palpebrce. It arises about a line above the inner margin of the optic foramen, and, passing forwards to the inner angle of the orbit, terminates in a rounded tendon, which plays in a ring or pulley, formed by fibro-cartilaginous tissue attached to a depression beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone, the contiguous surfaces of the tendon and ring being 150.—The relative position and attachment of the Muscles of the Left Eyeball.

The Levator palpebriB raises the upper eyelid, and is the direct antagonist of the Orbicularis palpebrarum. The four Recti muscles are attached in such a manner to the globe of the eye, that, acting singly, they will turn it either upwards, downwards, inwards, or outwards, as expressed by their names. If any two Recti act together, they carry the globe of the eye in the diagonal of these directions, viz. upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, downwards and inwards, or downwards and outwards. The movement of circumduction, as in looking round a room, is performed by the alternate action of the four Recti. By some anatomists, these muscles have been considered the chief agents in adjust- ing the sight at different distances, by compressing the globe, and so lengthening its antero-posterior diameter. The Oblique muscles rotate the eyeball on its aniero-ijosterior axis, this kind of movement being required for the correct viewing of an object, when the head is moved laterally, as from shoulder to shoulder, in order that the picture may fall in all respects on the same part of the retina of each eye.* Surgical Anatomy. The position and exact point of insertion of the tendons of the Internal and External recti muscles into the globe should be'carefully examined from the front of the eyeball, as the surgeon is often required to divide one or the other muscle for the cure of strabismus. In convergent strabismus, which is the most common form of the disease, the eye is turned inwards, requiring the division of the Internal rectus. In the divergent form, which is more rare, the eye is turned outwards, the External rectus being especially impli- cated. The deformity produced in either case is to be remedied by division of one or the other muscle. The operation is thus edected : the lids are to be well separated; the e3'eball being drawn outwards, the conjunctiva should be raised by a pair of forceps, and divided immediately beneath the_ lower border of the tendon of the Internal rectus, a little behind its insertion into the sclerotic; the submucous areolar tissue is then divided, and into the small aperture thus made, a blunt hook is passed upwards between the muscle and the globe, and the tendon of the muscle and conjunctiva covering it, divided by a pair of blunt-pointed scissors. Or the tendon may be divided by a subconjunctival incision, one blade of the scissors being passed upwards between the tendon and the conjunctiva, and the other between the tendon and the sclerotic. The student, when dissecting these muscles, should remove on one side of the subject the conjunctiva from the front of the eye, in order to see more accurately the position of the tendons, while on the opposite side the operation may be performed. * ' On the Oblique Muscles of the Eye in Man and Veiiebrate Animals,' by John Stbuthers, M.I)., ' Anatomical and Physiological Observations.'MUSCLES AND FASOi^. 5.

The Muscles in this region may be dissected by making a vertical incision through the integument from the margin of the lower lip to the chin : a second incision should then be carried along the margin of the lower j^iw as far as the angle, and the integument carefully removed in the direction shown in fig, 1.47. The Levator Lahii Liferioris (Levator mentiy is to be dissected by everting the lower lip and raising the mucous membrane. It is a small conical fasciculus, placed on the aide of the frsenum of the lower lip. It arises from the incisive fossa, ex- ternal to the symphysis of the lower jaw : its fibres descend to be inserted into the integument of the chin. Relations.

The Levator labii inferioris raises the lower lip, and protrudes it for- wards, and at the same time wrinkles the integument of the chin. The Depressor labii inferioris draws the lower hp directly downwards and a little outwards, ihe Depressor anguh oris depresses the angle of the mouth, being the antagonist to the Levator anguli oris and Zygomaticus major ; acting with these muscles, it will draw the angle of the mouth directly backwards. 8. Inter-Maxillaet Region. Orbicularis Oris. Buccinator. Risonus. Dissection. The dissection of these Mascl.s may be considerably facilitated by filing the caviTv of he mouth with tow, so as to distend the cheeks and hps ; the mouth should then be dosed by a few stitches, and the integument carefully removed from the surface. The Orbicularis Oris is a sphincter muscle, elliptic in form, composed of con- centric fibres, which surround the orifice of the mouth. It consists of two thick semicircular plants of muscular fibre, which interlace on either side ^th those of the Buccinator and other muscles inserted into the hps. On the free margin of the lips the muscular fibres are continued uninterruptedly from one hp to the othei around the corner of the mouth, forming a roundish fasciculus of fine pale fibres closely approximated. To the. outer part of each segment some special fibres are added by which the lips are connected directly with the maxillary bones and 'septum of the nose. The additional fibres for the upper segment consist ot lour bands two of which (Accessorii orbicularis superiores) arise from_ the alveolar border of the superior maxilla, opposite the incisor teeth, and arching outward. orea;h side, are continuous at the angles of the mouth with tbe o^ier musdes inserted into this part.

By its internal surface, with the buccal glands and mucous membrane of the mouth.^ Thepterygo-maxillarij Ztg^anreni separates the Buccinator muscle from the Superior constrictor of the pharynx. It is a tendinous band, attached by one extremity to the apex of the internal pterygoid plate, and by the other to the posterior extremity of the internal obUque line of the lower jaw. Its inner surface corresponds to the cavity of the mouth, and is lined by mucous membrane. Its outer surface is sepa- rated from the ramus of the jaw by a quantity of adipose tissue. , Its posterior border gives attachment to the Superior constrictor of the pharynx ; its anterior border, to the fibres of the Buccinator. The Bisorius (Santorini) consists of a narrow bundle of fibres, which arises in the fascia over the Masseter muscle, and passing horizontally forwards, is inserted, into the angle of the mouth, joining with the fibres of the Depressor anguli oris. It is placed superficial to the Platysma, and is broadest at its outer extremity. This muscle varies much in its size and form. Nerces. The Orbicularis oris is supplied by the facial, the Buccinator by the facial and by the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, which latter, how- ever, is by many anatomists regarded as a sensory nerve only. Actions. The Orbicularis oris is the direct antagonist of all those muscles which converge to the lips from the various parts of the face, its ordinary action producing the direct closure of the lips ; and its forcible action throwing the integument into wrinkles, on account of the firm connection between the latter and the surface of the muscle. The Buccinators contract and compress the cheeks, so that, during the process of mastication, the food is kept under the immediate pressure of the teeth. 9. Temporo-Maxillary Region. Masseter. Temporal. The Masseter has been already exposed by the removal of the integument from the side of the face (fig. 148; ; it is a short thick muscle, somewhat quadrilateral in form, consisting of two portions, superficial and deep. The superficial portimi, the larger, arises by a thick tendinous aponeurosis from the malar process of the superior maxilla, and from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch: its fibres pass downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the angle and lower half of the ramus of the jaw. The deep portion is much smaller, and more muscular in texture; it arises from the posterior third of the lower border and the whole of the inner surface of the zygomatic arch ; its fibres pass downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus and outer surface of the coronoid process of the jaw. The deep portion of the muscle is partly concealed, in front, by the superficial portion; behind, it is co-vered by the parotid gland. The fibres of the two portions are united at their insertion.2i8 MUSCLES AND ¥ASCI^. Belations.

The Internal Pterygoid is a thick quadrilateral muscle, and resembles the Masseter, in form, structure, and the direction of its fibres. It arises from the pterygoid fossa, being attached to the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate, and to the grooved surface of the tuberosity of the palate bone ; its fibres pass downwards, outwards, and backwards, to be inserted, by strong tendinous laminse, into the lower and back part of the inner side of the ramus and angle of the lower jaw, as high as the dental foramen.

The External Pterygoid is a short thick muscle, somewhat conical in form, which extends almost horizontally between the zygomatic fossa and the condyle of the jaw. It arises from the pterygoid ridge on the great wing of the sphenoid, and the portion of bone included between it and the base of the pterygoid process ; from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate; and from the tuberosity of the palate and superior maxillary bones. Its fibres pass horizontally backwards2 20 MUSCLES AND YASCIM. and outwards, to be inserted into a depression in front of the neck of tlie condyle of the lower iaw, and into the corresponding part of the interarticular fibro- cartilase.

Action 's The Temporal, Masseter, and Internal pterygoid raise the lower jaw aeainst the upper with great force. The superficial portion of the Masseter, and the Internal pterygoid, assist the External pterygoid in drawing the lower jaw forwards upon the upper, the jaw being drawn back again by the deep fibres ot the Masseter, and posterior fibres of the Temporal. The External pterygoid muscles are the direct agents in the trituration of the food, drawing the lower jaw directly forwards, so as to make the lower teeth project beyond the upper, it the muscle of one side acts, the corresponding side of the jaw is drawn forwards, and the other condyle remaining fixed, the symphysis deviates to the opposite side. The alternation of these movements on the two sides produces trituration. MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF The muscles of the Neck may be arranged into region in whicb they are situated.

A block having been placed at the back of the neck, and the face turned to the side opposite to that to be dissected, so as to place the parts upon the stretch, make two transverse mcisions: one from the chin, along the margin of the lower jaw, to the ma^toia process • and the other along the upper border of the clavicle. Connect these by an oblique incision made in the course of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, from the mastoid process to the sternum; the two tiaps of integument having been removed in the direction shown inhg. I47> the superficial fascia will be exposed. The superficial cervical fascia is exposed on the removal of the integument from the side of the neck ; it is an extremely thin aponeurotic lamina, wHch is hardly demonstrable as a separate membrane. Beneath it is found the Platysma myoides muscle, the external jugular vein, and some superficial branches of tbe cervical plexus of nerves. The Platysma Myoides (fig. 148) is a broad thin plane of muscular fibres, placed immediately beneath the skin on each side of the neck. It arises from the clavicle and acromion, and from the fascia covering the upper part of the Pectoral, Deltoid, and Trapezius muscles ; its fibres proceed obliquely upwards and inwards along the side of the neck, to be inserted into the lower jaw beneath the external obliqne line, some passing forwards to the angle of the mouth, and others becoming lost in the cellular tissue of the face. The most anterior fibres interlace, in front of the jaw, with the fibres of the muscle of the opposite side; those next in order become blended with the Depressor labii inferioris and the Depressor anguli oris ; others are prolonged upon the side of the cheek, and interlace, near the angle of the mouth, with the muscles in this situation, and may occasionally be traced to the Zygomatic muscles, or to the margin of the Orbicularis palpebrarum. Beneath the Platysma, the external jugular vein may be seen descending from the angle of the jaw to the clavicle. It is essential to remember the direction of the fibres of the Platysma, in connection with the operation of bleeding from this vessel; for if the point of the lancet is introduced in the direction of the muscular fibres, the orifice made will be filled up by the contraction of the muscle, and blood will not flow; but if the incision is made across the course of the fibres, they will retract, and expose the orifice in the vein, and so facilitate the flow of blood. Relations. By its external surface, with the integument, to whicb it is united closely below, but more loosely above. By its internal surface, with the Pectoralis major. Deltoid, and Trapezius, and with the clavicle. In tlie neck, with the external and anterior jugular veins, the deep cervical fascia, the super- ficial branches of the cervical plexus, the Sterno-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid,Omo-hyoid, and Digastric muscles. In front of the Sterno-mastoid, it covers the sheath of the carotid vessels; and behind it, the Scaleni muscles and the nerves of the brachial plexus. On the face, it is in relation with the parotid gland, the facial artery and vein, and the Masseter and Buccinator muscles. The deep cervical fascia is exposed on the removal of the Platysma myoides.MUSCLES AND FASCIA. 222 It is a si,ron^ fibrous layer, which invests the muscles of the neck, and encloses tho vessels and norvcs. It commences, as an extremely thin layer, at the back part of the neck, where it is attached to the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrfe, and to the ligamcntnm nucha3; and, passing forwards to the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, divides into two layers, one of which passes in front, and tho other behind that muscle. These join again at the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid; and, being contimied forwards to the front of the neck blend with the fascia of the opposite side. The superhcial layer of the deep cervical fascia (that which passes in front of the Sterno-mastoid , if traced upwards is found to pass across the parotid gland and Masseter muscle, forming the parotid and masseteric fascia, and is attached to the lower border of the zygoma, and more anteriorly to the lower border of the body of the ja,w; if the same layer is traced downwards, it is seen to pass to the upper border of the clavicle and sternum, beino-pierced just above the former bone by the external jugular vein. In the middle line of the neck, the fascia is thin above, and connected to the hyoid bone; but it becomes thicker below, and divides, just below the thyroid gland, into two layers the more super6cial of which is attached to the upper border of the sternum and interclavicular ligaments; the deeper and stronger layer is connected to the posterior border of that bone, covering in the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles Between these two layers is a little areolar tissue and fat, and occasion- ally a small lymphatic gland. Tbe deep layer of the cervical fascia (that which lies behind the posterior surfac-e of the Sterno-mastoid) sends numerous pro- longations, which invest the muscles and vessels of the neck ; if traced upwards, a process of the fascia, of extreme density, is found passing behmd and to the inner side of the parotid gland, to be attached to the base of the styloid process and ano-le of the lower jaw, termed the stylo-maxillary ligament; if traced down- wards and outwards, the fascia will be found to enclose the postenor belly of the Omo-hyoid muscle, binding it down by a distinct process, which descends to be inserted into the clavicle and cartilage of the first rib. The deep layer of the cervical fascia also assists in forming the sheath which encloses the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve. There are fi^ro-s s^P^a interv;ning between each of these parts, which, however are included together S one common investment.

The Omo-Hymd passes across the side of the neck, from the scapula to the hyoid bone. It consists of two fleshy bellies, united by a central tendon. It arises from the upper border of the scapula, and occasionally from the transverse liga- ment which crosses the suprascapular notch; its extent of attachment to the scapula varying from a few lines to an inch. Erom this origin, the posterior belly forms a flat, narrow fasciculus, which inclines forwards across the lower part of the neck, behind the Sterno-mastoid muscle, where it becomes tendinous, it then changes Its direction, formmg an obtuse angle, and the anterior belly ascends almost vertically upwards, close to the outer border of the Sterno-hyoid, to be inserted into the lower border of the body of the os hyoides, just external to the insertion of the Sterno- hyoid.

It arises from the whole length ot the mylo.hyoid ridge, from the symphysis in front to the last molar tooth behind. The posterior fibres pass obliquely forwards, to be inserted into the body of the OS hyoides. The middle and anterior fibres are inserted into a median fibrous raphe, where they join at an angle with the fibres of the opposite muscle. This median raphe is sometimes wanting ; the muscular fibres of the two sides are then directly continuous with one another. Relations. By its cutaneous surface, with the Platysma, the anterior belly of the Digastric, the supra-hyoid fascia, the submaxillary gland, and submental vessels.

The Mylo-hyoid should now be removed, in order to expose the muscles which lie beneath ; this is effected by detaching it from its attachments to the hyoid bone and jaw, and separating it by a vertical incision from its fellow of the opposite side. The Genio-Ityoid is a narrow, slender muscle, situated immediately beneath * the inner border of the preceding. It arises from the inferior genial tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis of the jaw, and passes downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the anterior surface of the body of the os hyoides.

Actions. This group of muscles performs two very important actions. They raise the hyoid bone, and with it the base of the tongue, during the act of deglu- tition ; or, when the hyoid bone is fixed by its depressors and those of the larynx, they depress the lower jaw. During the first act of deglutition, when the mass is being driven from the mouth iuto the pharynx, the hyoid bone, and with it the tongue, is carried upwards and forwards by the anterior belly of the Digasti'io, the Mylo-hyoid, and Genio-hyoid muscles. In the second act, when the mass is passing through the pharynx, the direct elevation, of the hyoid bone takes place by the combined action of all the muscles ; and after the food has passed, the hyoid bone is carried upwards and backwards by the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, which assist in preventing the return of the morsel into the mouth. 4.

The diiferonce in the direction of the fibres of this muscle and their separate origin from difierent parts of the hyoid bone, led Albmus and other anatomists to desei-ibe it as three muscles, under the names of the Basio-glossus, the Kerato- glossus, and the Chondro-glossus. , ■ ai. ^ u -a cn- ^ BdaUons.

By its deep surface, with the Gemo-hyo-glossus Lingualis; and Middle constrictor, the lingual vessels, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. i j The Ungualis is a longitudinal band of muscular fibres, situated on the under surface of the tongue, lying in the interval between the Hyo-glossus and the Genio-hyo-glossus, and extending from the base to the apex of the organ. Posteriorly, some of its fibres are lost in the base of the tongue, and others are occasionally attached to the hyoid bone. It blends with the fibres of the Stylo- glossus, in front of the Hyo-glossus, and is continued forwards as far as the apex of the tongue. It is in relation, by its under surface, with the ranine artery. The Stylo-Glossiis, the shortest and smallest of the three styloid muscles, arises from the anterior and outer side of the styloid process, near its centre, and from the stylo-maxillaiy ligament, to whicb its fibres, in most cases, are attached by a thin aponeurosis. Passing downwards and forwards, so as to become nearly hori- zontal in its direction, it divides upon the side of the tongue into two portions: one longitudinal, which is inserted along the side of the tongue, blending with the fibres of the Lingualis in front of the Hyo-glossus ; the other oblique, wbicb overlaps the Hyo-glossus muscle, and decussates with its fibres. Relations. By its external surface, from above downwards, with the parotid gland, the Internal pterygoid muscle, the sublingual gland, the gustatory nerve, and the mucous membrane of the mouth. By its internal surface, with the tonsil, the Superior constrictor, and the Hyo-glossus mu.scle. The Palato-Glossus, or Constrictor Isthmi Faucium, although it is one of the muscles of the tongue, serving to draw its base upwards during the act of deglu- tition, is more nearly associated witb the soft palate, both in its situation and function; it will, consequently, be described with that group of muscles. Nerves. The Palato-glossus is supplied by the palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion ; the Lingualis, by the chorda tympani ; the reniaining muscles of this group, by the hypoglossal. Actions. The movements of the tongue, although numerous and complicated, may be understood by carefully considering' the direction of the fibres of its muscles. The Genio-hyo-glossi, by means of their posterior and inferior fibres, draw upwards the hyoid bone, bringing it and the base of the tongue forwards, so as to protrude the apex from the mouth. The anterior fibres will draw the tongue back into the mouth. The whole length of these two muscles acting along the middle Kne of the tongue will draw it downwards, so as to make it concave from side to side, forming a channel along whicb fluids may pass towards the pharynx, as in sucking. The Hi/o-glossi muscles draw down the sides of the tongue, so as to render it convex from side to side. The Linguales, by drawing downwards the centre and apex of the tongue, render it convex from before backwards. The Palato-glossi draw the base of the tongue upwards, and the Stylo-glossi upwards and backwari^a. 5. Pharyngeal Region. Constrictor Inferior. Constrictor Superior. Constrictor Medius.

External View, the vertebral column. The parts being drawn well forwards, apply the edge of the saw immediately behind the styloid processes, and saw the base of the skull through from below upwards. The pharynx and mouth should then be stulled witli tow, m order to distend its cavity and render the muscles tense and easier of dissection. Tho hiferior Constrictor, the most superficial and thick- est of the three constrictors, arises from the side of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. To the cricoid cartilage it is attached in the interval be- tween the crico-thyroid mus, cle, in front, and the articular facet for the thyroid carti, lage hehind. To the thyroid cartilage, it is attached to the oblique line on the side of the great ala, the carti, laginous surface behind it, nearly as far as its posterior border, and to the inferior cornu. Prom these attachments, the fibres spread backwards and inwards, to be inserted into the fibrous raphe in the posterior me- dian line of the pharynx. The inferior fibres are horizontal, and continuous with the fibres of the oesophagus ; the rest ascend, in'creasing in obliquity, and overlap the Middle constrictor. The superior laryngeal nerve passes near the upper border, and the inferior, or recurrent laryngeal, beneath the lower border ot this muscle, previous to their entering the larynx. Belations.

The Middle Constrictor is a flattened, fan-shaped muscle, smaller than the pre- ceding and situated on a plane anterior to it. It arises from the whole length ot the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, from the lesser cornu, and from the stylo- hvoid li-ament. The fibres diverge from their origin : the lower ones descending beneath°the Inferior constrictor, tlie middle fibres passing transversely, and the upper fibres ascending and overlapping the Superior constrictor.

The muscles of this group are supplied by branches from the pharyngeal plexus and glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the Inferior constrictor, by an additional branch from the external laryngeal nerve, and by the recurrent laryngeal.^ Actions. When deglutition is about to be performed, the pharynx is drawn upwards and dilated in different directions, to receive the morsel propelled into it from the mouth. The Stylo-pharyngei, which are much farther removed from one another at their origin than at their insertion, draw the sides of the pharynx upwards and outwards, its breadth in the antero-posterior direction being increased by the larynx and tongue being carried forwards in their ascent. As soon as the morsel is received in the pharynx, the Elevator muscles relax, the bag descends, and the Constrictors contract upon the morsel, and convey it gradually downwards into the oesophagus. Besides, its action in deglutition, the pharynx also exerts an important influence in the modulation of the voice, especially in the production of the higher tones. 6. Palatal Region. Levator Palati.

The Palato-Pharyngeus is a long, fleshy fasciculus, narrower in the middle than at either extremity, forming, with the mucous membrane covering its surface, the posterior pillar of the soft palate. It is separated from the preceding by an angular interval, in which the tonsil is lodged. It arises from the soft palate by an expanded fasciculus, which is divided into two parts by the Levator palati. The anterior fasciculus, the thicker, lies in the soft palate between the Levator and Tensor, and joins in the middle line the corresponding part of the oiDposite muscle; ihe posterior fasciculus lies in contact with the mucous membrane, and also joins with the corresponding muscle in the middle line. Passing outwards and downwards behind the tonsil, the Palato-pharyngeus joins the Stylo-pharyn- geus, and is inserted with that muscle into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage, some of its fibres being lost on the side of the pharynx, and others passing across the middle line posteriorly, to decussate with the muscle of the opposite side. Relations. In the soft palate, its anterior and posterior surfaces are covered by mucous membrane, from which it is separated by a layer of palatine glands. By its superior harder, it is in relation with the Levator palati. Where it forms the posterior pillar of the fauces, it is covered by mucous membrane, excepting on its outer surface. In the pharynx it lies between the mucous membrane and the Constrictor muscles. Nerves. The Tensor palati is supplied by a branch from the otic gajigliou.; the Levator palati, and Azygos uvulre, by the facial, through the connection of its trunk with the Vidian, by the petrosal nerves; the other muscles, by the palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. Actions. During the first act of deglutition, the morsel of food is driven back, into the fauces by the pressure of the tongue against the hard palate; the base of the tongue being, at the same time, retracted, and the larynx raised with the pharynx, and carried forwards under it. During the second stage, the epiglottis is pressed over the superior aperture of the larynx, and the morsel glides past it ; then the Palato-glossi muscles, the constrictors of the fauces, contract behind tho food ; the soft palate is slightly raised by the Levator palati, and made tense by234 IJUSCLES AND FASCIiE. tlie Tensor palati; and tlio Palato-pharyngei contract, and come nearly together the nvula lilllng up the shght interval between them. By these means the food is prevented passing into the upper part of the pharynx or the posterior nares; at the same time, the latter muscles form an mchned plane directed obliquely downwards and backwards, along which the morsel descends mto the lower part of the pharynx. • ; A^„t..,r», Tho muscles of the soft palnte should be carefully dissected, the re- their action attentively lations they bear to ^ suuouum^ m ^ vnn.nrfid to divide one or more of these studied upon the dead 1 „ rinnrntioii or stapuvlornpny. oir vv . rcr^uHsuii uhobuuvvw, uuu,i, i.. w I tffiSn i'^, the edgSs of tho fissure Ire forcibly separated by tne acuou T Sores ia^^^^^^^ P™^^^^"^ """'^ considerable impediment o the l eSp ols after the perfomance of the operation for uniting their margins by S Won e has, consequently, recommended the division of these muscles as one of the adhesion , ne uas c i ^ ^j^j ^ ^ incision made with a curved SrXot ed behi Kl t^ The incision is to be' half-way between the hamular Lfnnd Fustachian tube and perpendicular to a line drawn between them.

To its outer side is the Levator anguli scapul£e, and the Scalenus posticus muscle. The Scalenus Posticus, the smallest of the three Scaleni, arises by a thin tendon from the outer surface of the second rib, behind the attachment of the Serratus ma-nus, and enlarging as it ascends, is inserted, by two or three separate tendons, into the posterior tubercles, of the transverse processes of the lower two or tlu-ee cervical vertebrae. This is the most deeply placed of the three Scalem, and is occasionally blended with the Scalenus medius. ^ t, . w Va Nerves The Rectus capitis anticus major and minor and the Rectus latera ls are supplied by the suboccipital ai^d deep branches of the cervical plexus; . the Longus colli and Scaleni, by branches from the lower cervical nerves. Actions The Rectus anticus major and minor are the direct antagonists of the muscles at the back of the neck, serving to restore the head ^^^^^^^ after it has been drawn backwards. These muscles also serve to flex the head, and from their obliquity, rotate it, so as to turn the face to one or the other s de. The Longus colh will flex and slightly rotate the cervical portion of the spine. The S ini muscles, taking their fixed point from below, draw the — processes of the cervical vertebrae, pending the spinal column to one or the other s'de If ^he muscles of both sides act, the spine wiU be kept erect. When they tike their fixed.point from above, they elevate the first and second nbs, and are, therefore, inspiratory muscles. MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF THE TRUNK.

Then make an incision along the middle line of the back, from the occipital protuberance to the coccyx. Make a transverse incision from the upper end of this to the mastoid process 5 and a third incision from its lower end, along the crest of the ilium to about its middle. This large intervening space should, for convenience of dissection, be subdivided by a fourth incision, extending obliquely from the spinous process of the last dorsal vertebra, upwards and outwards, to the acromion process. This incision corresponds with the lower border of the Trapezius muscle. The flaps of integument are then to be removed in the direction shown in the figure. The Trapezius is a broad, flat, triangular muscle, placed immediately beneath the skin, and covering the upper and back ijg.—Dissection of the Muscles of the Backi part of the neck and shoulders. It arises- from the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone ; from the liga- mentum nuchas, the spinous process of the seventh cervical, and those of all the dorsal vertebrae; and from the cor- responding portion of the supraspinous ligament. From this origin, the superior fibres proceed downwards and outwards, the inferior ones, upwards, and outwards ; and the middle fibres, horizontally ; and are inserted, the superior ones, into the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle; the middle fibres into the inner margin of the acromion process, and into the superior lip of the crest of the spine of the scapula; the inferior fibres con- verge near the scapula, and are at- tached to a triangular aponeurosis, which glides over a smooth surface at the inner extremity of the spine, and is in- serted into a tubercle at the outer part of the surface. The Trapezius is fleshy in the greater part of its extent, but tendinous at its origin and insertion. At its occipital origin, it is connected to the bone by a thin fibrous lamina, firmly adherent to the skin, and wanting the lustrous, shining appearance of aponeurosis. At its origin from the spines of the vertebras, it is connected to the bones by means of a broad semi-elliptical238 MUSCLES AND FASUlyE. aponeurosis, wliich occupies the space bcbween the sixth cervical and the third dorsal vertebroD, and forms, with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle, a ten- dinous ellipse. The rest of the muscle arises by numerous short tendmous fibres. If the Trapezius is dissected on both sides, the two muscles resenible a trapezium, or diamond-shaped quadrangle; tWo angles corresponding to the shoulders; a third to the occipital protuberance ; and the fourth to the spinous process of the last dorsal vertebriB. , , i? -i. ii. 1 The clavicular insertion of this muscle varies as to the extent of its attach- tnent- it sometimes advances as far as the middle of the clavicle, and may even become blended with the posterior edge of the Sterno-mastoid, or overlap it.

The Levator Anguli Scapulae is situated at the back paf t and side of the neck. It arises by four tendinous slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three or four upper cervical vertebras; these becoming fleshy are united so as to form a flat muscle, which, passing downwards and backwards, is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula, between the superior angle and the triangular smooth surface at the root of the spine. _ , m • EelaUons.

The Serratus Posticus Superior is a thin, flat, quadrilateral muscle, situated at the upper and back part of the thorax. It arises by a thin and broad aponeu- rosis, from the ligamentum nuchte, and from the spinous processes of the last cervical and two or three upper dorsal vertebriB. Inclining downwards and out- wards, it becomes muscular, and is inserted, by four fleshy digitations, into the upper borders of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, a little beyond their angles.

The Serratus Posticus Inferior is situated at the junction of the dorsal and lumbar regions: it is of an irregularly quadrilateral form, broader than the preceding, and separated from it by a considerable interval. It arises by a thin aponeurosis from the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and two or three upper lumbar vertebriB, and from the interspinous Hgaments. Passing obliquely upwards and outwards, it becomes fleshy, and divides into four flat digitations, which are inserted into the lower borders of the four lower ribs, a little beyond their angles.

The Vertebral Aponeurosis is a thin aponeurotic lamina, extending along the whole length of the back part of the thoracic region, serving to bind down the Erector spinse, and separating it from those muscles which connect the spine to the upper extremity. It consists of longitudinal and transverse fibres blended together, forming a thin lamella, which is attached in the median line to the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebriB ; externally, to the angles of the ribs; and below, to the upper border of the Inferior serratus and tendon of the Latissimus dorsi; above, it passes beneath the Splenius, and blends with the deep fascia of the neck.

The imafe Colli is a small muscle, connecting together the spmous processes of the cervical vertebrae, and analogous to the Spinalis dorsi m the dorsal region. It varies considerably in its size, and in its extent of attachment to the vertebrae, not only in difibrent bodies, but on the two sides of the same body^ It usually arises by fleshy or tendinous slips, varying from two to four in number, from the spinous processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebra3, and occasionally from the first and second dorsal, and is inserted into the spinous process of the axis, and occasionally into the spinous process of the two vcrtebriB below it. ihis muscle was found absent in five cases out of twenty-four. The Gomplexus is a broad thick muscle, situated at the upper and back part of the neck, beneath the Splenius, and internal to the Transversalis colli and Trachelo-mastoid. It arises, by a series of tendons, about seven m number, from the tips of the transverse processes of the upper three dorsal and seventh cervical, and from the articular processes of the three cervical above this. The tendons uniting form a broad muscle, which passes obliquely upwards and inwards, and is inserted into the innermost depression between the two curved lines of the occi- pital bone. This muscle, about its middle, is traversed by a transverse tendinous intersection. The Bwenter Gervicis is a small fasciculus, situated on the inner side of the preceding, and in the majority of cases blended with it; it has received its name from having a tendon intervening between two fleshy bellies. It is sometimes described as a separate muscle, arising, by from two to four tendinous slips, from the transverse processes of as many of the upper dorsal vertebi-EB, and inserted, on the inner side of the Complexus, into the superior curved line of the occipital bone.

It arises by tendinous fibres from the last bone of the sacrum, or hrst piece of the coccyx, and passes downwards to be anserted mto the lower part of the coccyx. It is a rudiment of the Extensor muscle of the caudal vertebra3 which exists in some animals. The Intertrmisversales are small muscles placed between the transverse processes of the vertebra. In the cervical region, they are most developed, consisting of two rounded muscular and tendinous fascicuh, which pass between the anterior and posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of two contiguous vertebra separated from one another by the anterior branch of a cervical nerve, which lies in the groove between them, and by the vertebral artery and vein. In this region there are seven pairs of these muscles, the first being between the atlas and axis, and the last between the seventh cervical a^d first dorsal vertebrae. In the dorsal region, they are least developed, consisting chiefly of rounded tendinous cords in the intertransverse spaces of the upper dorsal vertebra; but between the transverse processes of the lower three dorsal vertebras, and the first lumbar, they are muscular in structure. In the lumbar region, they are four in number, and consist of a single muscular layer, which occupies the entire interspace between the transverse processes of the lower lumbar vertebrsp, whilst those between the transverse processes of the upper lumbar are not attached to more than half the breadth of the process. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major arises by a pointed tendinous origin from the spinous process of the axis, and, becoming broader as it ascends, is inserted into the inferior curved line of the occipital bone and the surface of bone imme- diately below it.

The Erector spinro, comprising the Sacro-lambalis, with its accessory muscles, the Longissimus dorsi and Spinalis dorsi, serves, as its name implies, to maintain the spine in the erect posture ; it also serves to bend the trunk backwards when it is required to counterbalance the influence of any weight at the front of the body as, for instance, when a heavy weight is suspended from the neck, or when tlic'ro is any great abdominal development, as in pregnancy or dropsy; the peculiar gait under such circumstances depends upon the spine being drawn back- wards by the counterbalancing action of the Erector Bpina3 muscles. The muscles which' form the continuation of the Erector spinca upwards steady the head and neck and fix them in the upright position. If the Sacro-lumbalis and Longissimus dorsi of one side act, they serve to draw down the chest and spine to the corre- SDondino- side The Cervicalis ascendens, taking its fixed point from the cervical vertebri^ elevates those ribs to which it is attached. The Multifidus spinas acts successively upon the different parts of the spine; thus, the sacrum fumishes a fixed point from which the fasciculi of this muscle act upon the lumbar region ; these then become the fixed points for the fascicuH moving the dorsal region, and so on throughout the entire length of the spine; it is by the successive contraction and relaxation of the separate fascicuH of this and other muscles, that the spmo preserves the erect posture without the fatigue that would necessarily have been produced, had this position been maintained by the action of a single muscle. The Multifidus spina3, besides preserving the erect position of the spme, serves to rotate it, so that the front of the trunk is turned to the side opposite to that from wliich the muscle acts, this muscle being assisted in its action by the Obhquus externus abdominis. The Complexi, the analogues of the Multifidus spin^ in the neck, draw the head directly backward; if one muscle acts, it draws the head to one side, and rotates it so that the face is turned to the opposite side. The Rectus capitis posticus minor and the Superior oblique draw the head backwards; and the latter, from the obliquity in the direction of its fibres, may turn the fa«e to the opposite side. The Rectus capitis posticus major and the Obliquus inferior rotate the atlas, and, with it, the cranium round the odontoid process, and turn the face to the same side. Muscles of the Abdomen.

Dissectioik of \ are received between corresponding processes of the Serratns magnns; the three lower ones diminish in size from above downwards, receiving between them cor- responding processes from the Jjatissimus dorsi. From these attachments, the fleshy fibres proceed in various directions. Those from the lowest ribs pass nearly verti- cally downwards, to be inserted into the anterior half of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium ; the middle and upper fibres, directed downwards and forwards, ter- minate in tendinous fibres, which spread out into a broad aponeurosis. This apo- neurosis, joined with that of the opposite muscle along the median line, covers the whole of the front of the p-bdomen ; above it is connected with the lower border of the PectoraHs major; below, its fibres are closely aggregated together, and extend obliquely across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the os pubis and the linea ilio-pectinea. In the median line, it interlaces with the apo- neurosis of the opposite muscle, forming the linea alba, and extends from the ensi- form cartilage to the symphysis pubis. That portion of the aponeurosis which extends between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the ps pubis, is a broad band, folded invrards, and continuous below with the fascia lata; it is called Foupart's ligament. The portion which is reflected from Poupart's ligament into the pectineal line is caUed aimlernafs ligament* From the point of attachment of the latter to the pectineal Hne, a few fibres pass upwards and inwards, behind the inner pillar of the ring, to the linea alba. They diverge as they ascend, and form a thin, triangular, fibrous band, which is called the triangular ligament. In the aponeurosis of the External oblique, immediately abqve the crest of the OS pubis, is a triangular opening, the external abdominal ring, formed by a sepa- ration of the fibres of the aponeurosis in this situation: it serves for the trans- mission of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. This opening ;s directed obliquely upwards and outwards, an^ corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It is bounded, belpw, by the prest of the OS pubis ; above, by some curved fibres, which pass across the aponeurosis at the upper angle of the ring, so as to increase its strength ; and, on either side, by the margins of the aponeurosis, which are called the pillq,rs of the ring. Of these, the external, which is, at the same time, inferior, from the obliquity of its direction, is inserted into the spine of the os pubis. The internal, or superior pillar is attached to the front of the pubes and symphysis pubis, and interlaces with the corresponding fibres of the opposite muscle, the fibres of the right muscjp being superficial. To the margins of the pillars of the external abdominal ring is attached an exceedingly thin and delicate fascia, which is prolonged down over the outer surface of the cord and testis. This has received the name of inter- columnar fascia, irom its attachment to the pillars of the ring. It is also called the external spermatic fascia, from being the most external of the fasciaa which cover the spermatic cord. Relations.

Throughout the rest of its extent the fibres pass horizontaUy inwards, and near the outer margin of the Rectus, terminate m an aponeurosis, which is inserted into the linea alba ; its upper three-fourths passing behind the Rectus muscle, blending with the posterior lamella of the Internal obhque; its lower fourth passing in front of the Rectus. _ ^ Belatimis.

Between the 166.—A Transverse Section of the Abdomen in the Lumbar Region, anterior and middle layers is situated the Quadratus lumborum; between the middle and posterior, the Erector Spinse. The posterior lamella of this aponeurosis receives the attachment of the Internal oblique; it is also blended with the apo- neurosis of the Serratus posticus inferior and with that of the Latissitnus dorsi, forming the lumbar fascia. Dissection. To expose the Eectus muscle, open its sheath by a vertical incision extehding from the margin of the thorax to the pubes, and then reflect the two portions from the surface of the muscle, which is easily done, excepting at the linese transversa, where so close an adhesion exists, that the greatest care is requisite in separating thorn. Now raise the outer edge of the muscle, in order to examine the posterior layer of the sheath. By dividing the muscle m the centre, and turning its lower part downwards, the point where the posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin will be seen. The Beclus Abdominis is a long flat muscle, which extends along the whole length of the front of the abdomen, being separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the linea alba. It is much broader above than below, and arises by two2S4 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE. tendons, the external or larger lioing attached to tlio crest of the ob puhis; the internal, smaller portion, interlacing with its fellow of the opposite side, and being connected with the ligaments covering the symphysis pubis. The fibres ascend vertically, and the mnscle, becoming broader and thmner at its upper part, is inserted by three portions of unequal si.e into the cai-tilages of the fifth, sixth and seventh ribs. Some fibres are occasionally connected with the costo-xiphoid | ligaments, aM side of the ensiform cartilage. The Rebtus muscle is traversed by a series of tendinous intersections, which vai-v from two to five in numbei'i and have recfeived the name Linese transversa?. Orle of these is usually situated Opposite the umbilicus, and two above that point; of the latter one col'responds to the ensiform caftilage, and the other^ to the interval between the'ensiform cartilage and the umbilicus ; there is occasionally one below the umbilicus. Thtese intersections pass transversely or obliquely across the muscle iti a zigza'^ course; they rarely extend completely through its Bubstance, some- times pass only halfway across it, and are intimately adherent to the sheath m which the muscle is enclosed. The Rectus is enclosed in a shfeath (fig. i66) foi^med by the aponeuroses of the Oblique and Transversalis muscles, which are arranged in the following manner. When the ap'oneurosis of the Internal oblique ai-rives at the outer margm of the Rectus it divides into two lamelliB, one of which passes in front of the Rectus, blend- ing witb tlie aponeurosis of the External obliqile ; the other, behind it, blending with the aponeurosis of the Transvfersalis: and these, joining again at its inner border are inserted into the linea alba. This arrangement of the faSCise exists along the tipper threte-fourths of the muscle ; at the commencement of the lower fourth, th6 posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin^ or falciform eclqe the concavity of which looks downwards towards the pubes ; the aponeuroses of all three muscles passing in front of the Rectus without any separakon. The Rectus muscle, in the situation where its sheath is deficient, is separated from the peritoneum by the transversalis fascia. , -, . xi, i The Pyramidalis is a small muscle, triangular in shape, placed at the lower part of the abdomen, in front of the Rectus, and contained in the same sheath lith that muscle.

It presents numerous apertures for the passage of vessels and nerves; the largest of those is the umbilicus, which in the foetus transmits the nmbihcal vessels, but in the adult is obliterated, the cicatrix being stronger than th6 neigh- bouring parts; hence umbilical hernia occurs in the adult above the umbilicus, whilst in the foetus it occurs at the umbiHcus. The linea alba is in relation, in front, with the integument, to which it is adherent, especially at the umbilicus ; behind, it is separated from the peritoneum by the transversalis fascia; and below, by the urachus, and the bladder, when that organ is distended. The Unece semilunares are two curved tendinous lines, placed one on each side of the linea alba. Bach corresponds with the outer border of the Rectus muscle, extends ft-om the cartilage of the eighth rib to the pubes, and is formed by the aponeurosis of the internal oblique at its point of division t6 enclose the Rectus, where it is reinforced in front and behind by the External oblique and Transversalis. The linecB transversce are three or four narrow transverse lines which intersect the Rectus muscle as already mentioned : they connect the hneaS semilunares with the linea alba. Actions. The abdominal muscles perform a threefold action. When the pelvis and thorax are fixed, they compress the abdominal Viscera, by constricting the cavity of the abdomen, in which action they are nlaterially assisted by the descent of the diaphragm. By these means the fcetus is expelled from the uterus, the feeces from the rectum, the urine from the bladder, and its contents from the stomach in vomiting. If the spine is fixed, these muscles compress the lower part of the thorax, materially assisting in expiration. If the spine is not fixed, the thorax is bent directly forward, when the muscles of both sides act, or to either side when those of the two sides act alternately, rotation of the trunk at the same time taking place to the opposite side. If the thorax is fixed, these muscles acting together, draw the pelvis upwards, as in climbing; or, acting singly, they draw the pelvis upwards, and rotate the vertebral column to one side or the other. The Recti muscles, acting from below, depress the thorax, and consequently flex the vertebral column; when acting from above, they flex the pelvis upon the vertebral column. The Pyramidales are tensors of the linea alba. The Quadratus lumborum, by the portion inserted into the last rib, draws down and fixes that bone, acting thereby as a muscle of forced expiration : by the portion inserted into the lumbar vertebroe, it draws the spine towards the iHum, and thus inclines the trunk towards its own side: or, if the thorax and spine be fixed, it may act upon the pelvis—raising it towards its own side when only one muscle is put in action, and when both muscles act together, either from below or above, they flex the trunk. Muscles and ''Fxscm of the Thorax, The Muscles exclusively connected with the bones in this region are few in number. They are the Intercostales Externi. Infracostales. Intercostales Interni. Triangularis Sterni. Levatores Costarum.256 MUSCLES AND FASCIA. Mercodal Fascia:. A tliin bvit firm layer of fascia covers the outer surface of the l^Jxtcrnal intercostal and tlio inner surface of the Internal intercostal muscles; and a third layer, more delicate, is interposed between the two planes of muscular fibres Those are the intercostal fascifB ; they are best marked m those situations where the muscular fibres are deficient, as between the External intercostal muscles and sternum, in front; and between the Internal intercostals and spme, ^''^"Tho Intercostal Muscles (fig. 17°) are two thin planes of muscular and tendinous structure, placed one over the other, filling up the intercostal spaces, and being directed obliquely between the margins of the adjacent ribs. Ihey have received the name ' external' and ' internal,' from the position they bear to one another. The External Intercostals are eleven in number on each side, bemg attached to the adiacent margins of each pair of ribs, and extending from the tubercles of the ribs behind, to the commencement of the cartilages of the ribs, m Iront, where they terminate in a thin membranous aponeurosis, which is continued for- wards to the sternum. They arise from the outer Hp of the groove on the lower border of each rib, and are inserted into the upper border of the rib below. In the two lowest spaces they extend to the end of the ribs. Their fibres are directed obUquely downwards and forwards, in a similar direction with those ot the External oblique muscle. They are thicker than the Internal mtercostals.

It arises from the lower part of the side of the sternum, from the inner surface of the ensiform cartilage, and from the sternal ends of the costal cartilages of iho three or foar lower true ribs. Its fibres diverge upwards and outwards, to be inserted by fleshy digitations into the lower border and inner surfaces of the costal cartilages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. The lowest fibres of this muscle are horizontal in their direction, and are continuous with those of the Transversalis; those which succeed are oblique, whilst the superior fibres are almost vertical. This muscle varies much in its attachment, not only in dilTerent bodies, but on opposite sides of the same body. Belations. In front, with the sternum, ensiform cartilage, costal cartilages, Internal intercostal muscles, and internal mammary vessels. Behind, with the pleura, pericardium, and anterior mediastinum. The Levatores Gostarimi (ftg. 161), twelve in number on eacli side, are small tendinous and fleshy bundles, which arise from the extremities of the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebras, and passing obliquely downwards and outwards, are inserted into the upper rough surface of the rib below them, between the tubercle and the angle. That for the first rib arises from the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and that for the last from the eleventh dorsal. The Inferior levatores divide into two fasciculi, one of which is inserted as above described ; the other fasciculus passes down to the second rib below its origin ; thus, each of the lower ribs receives fibres from the transverse processes of two vertebrsB'. Nerves. The muscles of this group are supplied by the intercostal nerves. Actions. The Intercostals are the chief agents in the movement of the rihs in ordinary respiration. The External intercostals raise the ribs, especially their fore part, and so increase the capacity of the chest from before backwards ; at the same time they evert their lower borders, and so enlarge the thoracic cavity transversely. The Internal intercostals, at the side of the thorax, depress the ribs, and inveiii their lower borders, and so diminish the thoracic cavity ; but at the fore part of the chest these muscles assist the External intercostals in raising the cartilages. * The Levatores Costarum assist the External intercostals in raising the ribs. The Triangularis sterni draws down the costal cartilages; it is therefore an expiratory muscle. Muscles of Inspiration and Expiration. The muscles which assist the action of the Diaphragm in inspiration are the Intercostals and the Levatores costarum as above stated, the Scaleni, the Serratus posticus superior, and to a slight extent the Subclavius. When the need for more forcible action exists, the shoulders and the base of the scapula are fixed, and then the powerful muscles of forced inspu-ation come into play ; the chief of these are the Serratus magnus, Latissimus dorsi, and the Pectorales, particularly the Pectoralis minor. The Sterno-mastoid also, when the head is fixed, assists in forced inspiration, by drawing up the sternum, and by fixing the clavicle, and thus affording- a fixed point for the action of the muscles of the chest. The ordinary action of expiration is merely passive, the resilience of the ribs and the elasticity of the lungs producing a tendency to a vacuum. This causes the ascent of the abdominal viscera covered by the Diaphragm.

The Biaplmifjw (^.lafimy^m, a jJartUum wall) (ing. 167) is a thin musculo-fibrous septum, placed obliquely at tho junction of the upper with tlie middle third of the trunk and separating tho thorax fi'om tho abdomen, foi-ming tho floor of the former cavity and the roof of tho latter. It is elliptical, its longest diameter being from side to side, somewhat fo,n-shapcd, the broad elliptical portion being horizontal, the narrow part, which represents the handle of the fan, vertical, and joined at right 167.—The Diapliragni. Under Surfiice. CartiH" ancles to tho former. It is from this circumstance that some anatomists describe it as consisting of two portions, the upper or great muscle of the Diaphragm, and the lower or lesser muscle. It arises from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax, being attached, in front, by fleshy fibres to the ensiform carti age; on either side, to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of the six or seven inferior ribs, interdigitating with the Transversalis; and behind, to two aponeurotic arches, named the ligamentum arcuatum externum and internum, and to the lumbar vertebm. The (ibres from these sources vary in length ; t^K^se aris- ing from the ensiform appendix are very short and occasionally aponeurotic ; tliose from the ligamenta arei'^.a, and more espoeially those from the ribs aU - -de^of the chest are longer, .le.scribe well-marked curves as they ascend, and fina 1) co" terge to be inserted into the circumference of the central tendon. Bot.-een tho sidesDIAPHRAGM. 259 of the muscular slip fi-om the ensiforra apponclix and the cartilages of the adjoining ribs, the fibres of tiie Diaphragm are deficient, tlio interval being filled by areolar tissue, covered on the thoracic side by tLe pleuiw ; on the abdominal, by the perito- neum. This is, consequently, a weak point, and a portion of the contents of the abdomen may protrude into the chest, forming phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia, or a collection of pus in the mediastinum may descend through it, so as to point at the epigastrium. Tho Ufjamcntum arcuahm intermmn is a tendinous arch, thrown across the tipper part of the Psoas magnus ipuscle, on each side of the spine. It is connected, by one end, to the outer side of the body of the first, and occasionally the second lumbar vertebra, being continuous with the outer side of the tendon of the corresponding crus; and, by the other end, to the front of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra. The lujamenium arcuatum externum is the thickened upper margin of the anterior lamella of the transversahs fascia; it arches across the upper part of the Quadratus lumborum, being attached, by one extremity, to the front of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra; and, by the other, to the apex and lower margin of the last rib. To the spine, the Diaphragm is connected by two crura, which are situated on the bodies of the lumbar vertebra3, one on each side of the aorta. The crura, at then- origin, are tendinous in structure; the right crus, larger and longer than the left, arising from the anterior surface of the bodies and intervertebral substances of the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebra3; the left, from the second and third; both blending with the anterior common ligament of the spine. A tendinous arch is thrown across the front of the vertebral column, from the tendon of one crus to that of the other, beneath which pass the aorta, vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. ^ The tendons terminate in two large fleshy belhes, which, with the tendinous portions above alluded to, are called the crura, or pillars of the dia- phragm. The outer fasciculi of the two crura are directed upwards and outwards to the central tendon ; but the inner fasciculi decussate in front of the aorta, and then diverge, so as to surround the oesophagus before ending in the central tendon. The anterior and larger of these fasciculi is formed.by the right crus. The Central or Gordiform Tendon of the Diaphragm is a thin tendinous apo- neurosis situated at the centre of the vault formed by the muscle, immediately below the pericardmm, with which its circumference is blended. It is shaped somewhat hke a trefoil leaf, consisting of three divisions, or leaflets, separated from one another by slight indentations. The right leaflet is the largest; the middle one directed towards the ensiform cartilage, the next in size; and the left the smallest In stnicture, the tendon is composed of several planes of fibres, which intersect one another at various angles, and unite into straight or curved bundles- an arrangement which affords it additional strength smaUer aSr3 "^'^ ^'-^^^-S^ are three large and several Z l:ZJZ:.

At the lower part of the thoracic region, this fascia is well developed, and is continuous with the fibrous sheath of the Uecti muscles. FORE-ARM PALM of HAND Ani'eeior Thoracic Region. Pectoralis Major. Pectoralis Minor. Subclavius. The Pectoralis Major (fig. 169) is a broad, thick, triangular muscle, situated at the upper and fore part of the chest, in front of the axilla. It arises from the anterior surface of the sternal half of the clavicle; from half the breadth of the anterior surface of the sternum, as low down as the attachment of the cartilage ot the sixth or seventh rib ; its origin consisting of aponeurotic fibres which mtersect with those of the opposite muscle; it also arises from the cartilages of all t^e true ribs,with the exception, frequently, of the first, or of the seventh, or both; and from the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle of the abdomen, ibe fibres from this extensive origin converge towards its insertion, gmng to the muscle a radiated appearance. Those fibres which arise from the clavicle pass obhquely outwards and downwards, and arc usually separated from the rest by a cellular intei-val: those from the lower part of the sternum, and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, pass upwards and outwards; whilst the middle fibres pass lionzonta ly. As these three sets of fibres converge, they are so disposed that the upper overlap the middle, and the middle the lower portion, the fibres of tbo lower portion bemg folded backwards upon themselves ; so that those fibres which are lowest in front become higl.est at their point of insertion. They all terminate in a flat tendon abont two inches broad, wl.ieh is inserted into tho anterior bicipital rulge of thoANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. 263 Immerus This tendon consists of two laminas, placed one in front of tlie other, and usually blended togetlior below. The anterior, the thicker, receives the cla- vicular and upper half of the sternal portion of the muscle ; the posterior lamina receiviuo- the attachment of the lower half of the sternal portion. From this arrangement it results, that the fibres of the upper and middle portions of the muscle are inserted into the lower part of the bicipital ridge ; those of the lower portion, into the upper part. The tendon, at its insertion, is connected with that of the Deltoid ; it sends up an expansion over the bicipital groove towards the head of 169.—Muscles of the Chest and Fr.iut of the Arm.

The muscle should then be reflected outward and its tendon carefully examined. Tho Pectoralis minor is now exposed and humediately above it, in the interval between its upper border and the clavicle, a strong fascia, the costo-coracoid inemhranc. The costo-coracoid memhrane protects the axillary vessels aud nerves; it is very thick and dense externally, where it is attached to the coracoid process, and is continuous with the fascia of the arm; more internally, it is connected with the lower border of the clavicle, as far as the sternal extremity of the first rib ; traced downwards, it passes behind the Pectoralis minor, surrounding, m a more or less complete sheath, the axillary vessels and nerves ; and above, it sends a prolongation behind the Subclavius, which is attached to the lower border of the clavicle, and so encloses the muscle in a kind of sheath. The costo-coracoid membrane is pierced by the cephalic vein, the thoracico-acromialis artery and vein, supenor thoracic artery and anterior thoracic nerves. . j ^ The Pectoralis Minor (fig. 170) is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, situated at tlie upper part of the thorax, beneath the Pectoralis major. It arises by three tendinous digltations, from the upper margin and outer surface of the thu-d, fourth, and fifth ribs, near their cartilages, and from the aponeurosis covering the Inter- costal muscles; the fibres pass upwards and outwards, and converge to form a flat tendon, wliicli is inserted into the anterior border of the coracoid process of the ^""^mations.

In this space are seen the axillary vessels and nerves. The costo-coracoid membrane should now be removed, when the Subclavius muscle wiU ^'tTc Snhclavius is a long, thin, spindle-shaped mu^scle, placed in the interval betv^een L clavicle and the first rib. It arises by a short, thick endon from the cSXe of the first rib, in front of the rhomboid hgament; the Aeshy fibres proceed obliquely outwards, to be inserted into a deep groove on the under surface nf the middle third of the clavicle. ^ -x • BcmZ By its rm^er surface, with the clavicle.

If the arm has been raised by the Deltoid, the Pectoralis major will, conjointly with the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major, depress it to the side of the chest - and, if acting singly, it will draw the arm across the front of the chest. The Pectoralis minor depresses the point of the shoulder, drawing the scapula downwards and inwards to the thorax. The Snbclavius depresses the shoulder, drawing the clavicle downwards and forwards. When the arms are fixed, all throe muscles act upon the ribs, drawing them upwards and expanding the chest, and thus becoming very important agents in forced inspiration. Asthmatic patients always assume this attitude, fixing the shoulders, so that all these muscles may be brought into action to assist in dilating the cavity of the chest. Lateral Thokacic Region. Serratus Magnus. The Serratm Magnus (fig. 170) is a broad, thin, ard irregulai^Iy quadrilateral muscle, situated at the upper part and side of the chest. It arises by nine fleshy 170.—Muscles of the Chest and Front of the Arm, with the Boundnries of the Axillii. digitahons from the outer surface and upper border of the eight upper ribs (the second rib having two), and from the aponeurosis covering the upper intercostal spaces, and is inser ed into the whole length of the inner margin of the posteHor border of the scapnla.

From this extensive origin, the fibres converge towards their insertion, the middle passing vertically, the anterior obliquely backwards, the posterior obliquely forwards ; they unite to form a thick tendon, which is inserted into a rough prominence on the middle of the outer side of the shaft of the humerus. This muscle is remarkably coarse in texture, and intersected by three or four tendinous laminoe ; these are attached, at intervals, to the clavicle and acromion, extend into the substance of the muscle, and give origin to a number of fleshy fibres. The largest of these laminte extends from the summit of the acromion. Belations. By its sitimrficial surface, with the integument, the superficial fascia, Platysma, and supra-acromial nerves. Its deef surface is separated from the head of the humerus by a large sacculated synovial bursa, and covers the coracoid process, coraco-acromial ligament, Pectoralis minor, Coraco-brachialis, both heads of the Biceps, tendon of the Pectoralis major, Infra-spinatus, Teres minor, Triceps (its scapular and external heads), the circumflex vessels and nerve, and the humerus. Its anterior hol der is separated from the Pectoralis major by a cellular interspace, which lodges the cephalic vein and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its posterior border rests on the Infraspinatus and Triceps muscles. Nerves. The Deltoid is supplied by the circumflex nerve. Actions. The Deltoid raises the arm directly from the side, so as to bring it at right angles with the frunk. Its anterior fibres, assisted by the Pectoralis major, draw the arm forwards; and its posterior fibres, aided by the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi, draw it backwards. Dissection. Divide the Deltoid across, netir its upper part, by an incision carried along the margin of the clavicle, the acromion process, and spine of the scapula, and reflect it downwards; the bursa will be seen on its under surface, as well as the circumflex vessels and nerve. The insertion of the muscle should be carefully examined. Anteeior Scapular Region. Subscapularis. The suhscapular aponeurosis is a thin membrane, attached to the entire cir- cumference of the subscapular fossa, and afi'ording attachment by its inner surface to some of the fibres of the Subscapularis muscle : when this is removed, the Sub- scapularis muscle is exposed. The Sulscapidaris (fig. 170) is a large triangular muscle, which fills up the sub- scapular fossa, arising from its internal two-thirds, with the exception of a narrow margin along the posterior border, and the inner side of the superior a,nd inferior angles, which afibrd attachment to the Serratus magnus. Some fibres arise from tendinous laminas, which intersect the muscle, and are attached to ridges on the bone ; and others from an aponeurosis, which separates the muscle from the Teres major and the long head of the Triceps. The fibres pass outwards, and, gradually converging, terminate in a tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Those fibres which arise from the axillary border of the scapula are inserted mto the neck of the humerus to the extent of an inch below the tube- rosity. The tendon of the muscle is in close contact with the capsular ligament ofthe shoulder-jomt and glides over a large bursa, which separates it from the base of the coracoid process. This bursa communicates with the cavity of the joint by an aperture m the capsular ligament. Belatiorts. By its anterior surface, with the Serratus magnus, Coraco-brachialis, and Biceps, and the axillary vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface, with the scapula, the subscapular vessels and nerves, and the capsular ligament ^f the shoulder-jomt. Its lower border is contiguous with the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi. Nerves. It is supplied by the upper and lower subscapular nerves. Actions.

The fibres converge to a tendon, which glides over the external border of the spine of the scapula, and, passing across the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint, is inserted into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus. The tendon of this muscle is occasionally sepai-ated from the spine of the scapula by a synovial bursa, which communicates with the synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint. Relations.

By its anterior surface, with the scapula, from which it is separated by the suprascapular and dorsalis scapulse vessels, and with the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. Its lower border is in contact with the Teres minor, and occasionally united with it, and with the Teres major. The Teres Minor is a narrow, elongated muscle, which lies along the inferior border of the scapula. It arises from the dorsal surface of the axillary border of the scapula for the upper two-thirds of its extent, and from two aponeurotic lamiuEB, one of which separates this muscle from the Infraspinatus, the other from the Teres major ; its fibres pass obliquely upwards and outwards, and terminate in a tendon, which is inserted into the lowest of the three facets on the great tube- rosity of the humerus, and, by fleshy fibres, into the humerus immediately below it. The tendon of this muscle passes across the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint. Relations. By its posterior surface, with the Deltoid, Latissimus dorsi, and integument.

Tho Biceps is a long fusiform muscle, occupying the whole of the anterior surface of the arm, and divided above into two portions or heads, from whicli circumstance it has received its name. Tho short head arises by a thick flattened tendon from the apex of the coracoid process, in common with the Coracoid- brachialis. The long head arises from the upper margin of the glenoid cavity, by a long rounded tendon, which is continuous with tho glenoid ligament. This tendon arches over tho head of the humerus, being enclosed in a special sheath of the synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint; it then pierces the capsular ligament at its attachment to the humerus, and descends in the bicipital groove, in which it is retained by a fibrous prolongation from the tendon of tlie Pectoralis major. The fibres from this tendon form a rounded belly, and, about the middle of the arm, join with the portion of the muscle derived from the short head. The belly of the muscle, narrow and somewhat flattened, terminates above the elbow in a flattened tendon, which is inserted into the back part of the tuberosity of the radius, a synovial bursa being interposed between the tendon.and the front of the tuberosity. The tendon of the muscle is thin and broad; as it approaches the radius it becomes narrow and twisted upon itself, being applied by a flat surface to the back part of the tuberosity: opposite the bend of the elbow the tendon gives off, from its inner side, a broad aponeurosis, the bicipital fascia, which passes obliquely downwards and inwards across the brachial artery, and is continuous with the fascia of the forearm (fig. 169). The inner border of this muscle forms a guide to the position of the vessel, in tying the brachial artery in the middle of the arm.* Belations. Its anterior surface is overlapped above by the Pectoralis major and Deltoid ; in the rest of its extent it is covered by the superficial and deep fasciiB and the integument. Its posterior stirface rests on the shoulder-joint and humerus, from which it is separated by the Subscapularis, Teres Major, Latissimus dorsi' BrachiaUs anticus, and the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Its mner border is in relation with the Coraco-brachialis, the brachial vessels, and median nerve; its Older border, with the Deltoid and Supinator longus. The BrachiaUs Anticus is a broad muscle, which covers the elbow-joint and the lower half of the front of the humerus. It is somewhat compressed from before backward, and is broader in the middle than at either extremity. It arises from the lower half of the outer and inner surfaces of the shaft of the humerus • and commences above at the insertion of the Deltoid, which it embraces by two angular processes Its origin extends below, to within an inch of the margin of the arti- cular sm-face and is limited on each side by the external and internal borders of the shaft of the humerus. It also arises from the intermuscular septa on each side but more extensively from the inner than the outer. Its fibres converge to a thick tendon, which is inserted into a rough depression on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna, being received into an interval between two fleshy slips of the Flexor digitorum profundus.

It may be exposed by removing tho Triceps from the lower part of the humerus. It consists of one or two slender fasciculi, which arise from the humerus, immediately above the olecranon fossa, and are inserted into the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. , Nerves. The Triceps and Subanconeus are supplied by the musculo-spiral ''™d'ioii'; Tho Triceps is the great Extensor musclo of the forearm ; serving, when the forearm is flexed, to draw it into a right Hne with the arm. It is the direct antagonist of the Biceps and Brachialis anticus. When the arm is extended, the lono- head of tho muscle may assist the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi m drawing the humerus backwards. The long head of tho Triceps protects the under part of''the shoulder-joint, and prevents displacement of the head of the humerus downwards and backwards. Muscles of the Forearm. Dissection. To dissect the forearm, place the limb in the position indicated in fig. 168 ; make a vertical incision along the middle line from the elbow to the wrist, and a transverse incision at each extremity of this; the flaps of integument being removed, the fascia of the forearm is exposed. The deep fascia of the forearm, continuous above with that enclosing the arm, is a dense highly glistening aponeurotic investment, which forms a general sheath enclosing the muscles in this region; it is attached behind to the olecranon and posterior border of the ulna, and gives off from its inner sui*face numerous inter- muscular septa, which enclose each muscle separately. It consists of circular and oblique fibres, connected together by numerous vertical fibres. It is much thicker on the dorsal than on the palmar surface, and at the lower than at the upper part of the forearm, and is strengthened by tendinous fibres derived from the Brachialis- anticus and Biceps in front, and from the Triceps behind. Its inner surface gives origin to muscular fibres, especially at the upper part of the inner and outer sides of the forearm, and forms the boundaries of a series of conical- shaped cavities, in which the muscles are contained. Besides the vertical septa separating each muscle, transverse septa are given ofi" both on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the forearm, separating the deep from the superficial layer of muscles. Numerous apertures exist in the fascia for the passage of vessels and nerves; one of these, of large size, situated at the front of the elbow, serves for the passage of a communicating branch between the superficial and deep veins. The muscles of the forearm may be subdivided into groups corresponding to the region they occupy. One group occupies the inner and anterior aspect of the fore- arm, and comprises the Flexor and Pronator muscles. Another group occupies its outer side; and a third, its posterior aspect. The two latter groups include all the Extensor and Supinator muscles. Anterior Brachial Region. Superficial Layer. Pronator Radii Teres. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris. Flexor Carpi Radialis. Flexor Sublimis Digitorum. Palmaris Longus. These muscles take origin from the internal condyle of the humerus by a com- mon tendon. The Pronator Radii Teres arises by two heads. One, the larger and more superficial, arises from the humerus, immediately above the internal condyle, and fi-om the tendon common to the origin of the other muscles; also from the fascia T274 MUSCLES AND FASCTiE. of the forearm, and intoi'muRciilar septum between it and the Flexor carpi radialis. Tho other head is a thin liiKciuuluH, which arises (Vom the inner side of tho coronoid process of tho ulna, joining tho preceding at an acute angle. Between the two heads paasos the median nerve.

Superficial Muscles. side, and terminates in a flat tendon, which turns over the outer margin of tho radius, and is inserted into a rough ridge at the middle of the outer surface of the shaft of that bone. Variations. The coronoid origin of this muscle presents numerous variations. It is occasionally absent, and in one case re- corded by Dr. Macalistor {Journal of Anat. and Phys. 2nd series, No. i, p. 9), it existed as a distinct muscle, inserted into the front of the radius higher up than the rest of the mass. In other cases the coronoid slip has been found connected with the Palmaris longus or the Flexor carpi radialis, instead of the Pronator teres, and other slighter anomalies have been recorded by Dr. Macalister. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the deep fascia, the Supinator longus, and tho radial vessels and nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Brachialis anticus. Flexor subHmis digitorum, the median nerve, and ulnar artery: the small, or deep, head being interposed between the two latter structures. Its outer lorder forms the inner boundary of a triangular space, in which is placed the brachial artery, median nerve, and tendon of the Bi- ceps muscle. Its inner harder is in contact with the Flexor carpi radialis. The Flexor Carpi Radialis lies on the inner side of the preceding muscle. It arises from the internal condyle by the common tendon, from the fascia of the forearm, and from the inter- muscular septa between it and the Pronator teres, on the outside; the Palmaris longus, internally ; and the Flexor subhmis digitorum, beneath. Slender and aponeurotic in structure at its commencement, it increases in size, and terminates in a tendon which forms the lower two-thirds of its length. This tendon passes through a canal on the outer side of the annular ligament, runs through a groove in the os trapezium (which is converted into a canal by a fibrous sheath, and lined by a synovial membrane), and is inserted into tho base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. The radial artery lies between the tendon of this muscle and the Supinator longus, and may easily be tied in this situation. Relations.

Wood describes a muscle occnaionnlly found (6 times in 70 subjects) beneath the Flexor carpi radialis, and wliich he has named the Flexor carpi radiahs brevis vel profundus. In tho best marked speciuien it arose from tlie outer side ol the front surface of the radius, above the Pronator nuadratus, and below the Flexor longus pol icis, and was inserted into the base of the middle metacarpal bone and os ma-nuni; but several variations are described, both in its orifrin and insertion. Mr. Norton has also found an instance of a similar muscle attached to tho middle metacarpal bone. Jottrn. of Anat. and Fhys. Nov. 1866, p. 55. The Palmark Longtis is a slender, fasiform mnscle, lying on tho inner side of the preceding. It arises from the inner condyle of the humerus by the common tendon, from tho deep foscia, and the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It terminates in a slender flattened tendon, which is inserted nto the annular ligament, expanding to end in the palmar fascia, Vnriaticms. This muscle is often absent; when present, it offers many varieties. Ita fleshy belly is sometimes very long, or may occupy the middle of the muscle, which is tendinous at either extremity; or the Palmaris may be muscular at its lower extremity, ita upper part being tendinous. Occasionally, there is a second Palmaris longus placed on the inner side of the preceding, terminating, below, partly in the annular ligament or fascia, and partly in the small muscles of the little finger. Belations. By its siuperficial surface, with the deep fascia. By its deep surface, with the Flexor digitorum sublimis. Internally, with the Flexor carpi nlnaris. Externally, with the Flexor carpi radialis. The median nerve lies close to the tendon, just above the wrist, on its inner and posterior side. The Flexor Gdrpi JJlnaris lies along the ulnar side of the forearm. It arises by two heads, connected by a tendinous arch, beneath which pass the ulnar nerve, and posterior ulnar recurrent artery. One head arises from the inner condyle of the humerus by the common tendon ; the other, from the inner margin of the olecranon, by an aponeurosis from the upper two-thirds of the posterior border of the ulna, and from the intermuscular septum between it and the Flexor sublimis digitorum. The fibres terminate in a tendon, which occupies the anterior part of the lower half of the muscle, and is inserted into the pisiform bone,, some fibres being prolonged to the annular ligament and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. The ulnar artery lies on the outer side of the tendon of this muscle, in the lower two-thirds of the forearm; the tendon forming a guide in tying the vessel in this situation. Belations.

By its outer or radial border with the Palmaris longus above, and the ulnar vessels and nerve below. The Flexor Digitorum Sublimis (perforatus) is placed beneath the preceding muscles, which therefore must be removed in order to bring its attachment into view. It is the largest of the muscles of the superficial layer, and arises by three heads. One head arises from the internal condyle of the humerus by the common tendon, from the mternal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint, and from the inter- muscular septum common to it and the preceding muscles. The second head arises from the mner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, above the ulnar origin of the Pronator radii teres (fig. 90). The third head arises from the oblique line of the radius, extending from the tubercle to the insertion of the Pronator radii teres^ The fibres pass vertically downwards, forming a broad and thick muscle, which divides mto four tendons about the middle of the forearm ; as these tendons pass beneath the annular ligament into tho palm of the hand, they are arranged in pairs the anterior pair corresponding to the middle and ring fingers ; the posterior pair to the mdex and little fingers. The tendons diverge from o;e another as they pass onwards and are finally inserted into the lateml margins of the second phalanges, about their middle.

It arises fi-om the oblique line on the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, and the surface of bone immediately below it; from the anterior border of the ulna ; and from a strong aponeurosis which covers the inner third of the muscle. The fibres pass horizontally outwards, to be inserted into the lower fourth of the an- terior surface and external border of the shaft of tho radius. Relations.

All the muscles of the superficial luyer are supplied hy the median nerve, excepting the Flexor carpi uluarls, which is supplied by the uh,ar. Of the deep layer the Flexor profundus digitorum is supplied conjointly by the ulnar and by the'median, through its branch, the anterior interosseous nerve, which also supplies the Flexor longus pollicis and Pronator quadratus. Actions. These muscles act upon the forearm, the wrist, and hand. Those acting on the forearm, are the Pronator radii tor-es and Pronator Quadratus, which rotate the radius upon the ulna, rendering the hand prone ; when pronation has been fully effected, the Pronator radii teres assists the other muscles in flexing tlie forearm. The flexors of the wrist are the Flexor carpi ulrmris and radialis; and the flexors of the phalanges are the Flexor sublimis and Profundus digitorum ; the former flexing the second phalanges, and the latter the last. The Flexor longus pollicis flexes the last phalanx of the thumb. The three latter muscles, after flexing the phalanges, by continuing their action, act upon the wrist, assisting the ordinary flexors of this joint; and all those which are attached to the humerus assist in flexing the forearm upon the arm. The Pulmaris longus is a tensor of the palmar fascia ; when tMs action has been fully eflected, it flexes the hand upon the forearm. Radui Region. '(Fig. i74.) Supinator Longus.

The Extensor Gar^n Ita- clialis Brevior is shorter, as its name implies, and thicker than the preceding muscle, beneath which it is placed. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus by a tendon common to it and the three following muscles ; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint; from a strong aponeurosis which covers its surface ; and fi'om the inter- muscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. The fibres terminate about the middle of the forearm in a flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the pre- ceding muscle, accompanies it to the wrist lying in the same groove on the posterior surface of the radius ; passes beneath the annular ligament, and, diverging somewhat from its fellow, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, on its radial side. The tendons of the two pre- ceding muscles pass through the same compartment of the annular ligament, and are lubricated by a single syno- vial membrane, but are sepa- rated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone as they lie in the groove at the back of the I'adius.

It arises from the external condyle of the humerus by the common tendon, from the deep fascia, and tho intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. Just below the middle of the forearm it divides into three tendons, which pass, to<^ether with the Extensor indicis, through a separate compartment of the annular lis°ament, lubricated by a synovial membrane. -Jhe 7endons then diverge the innermost one dividing into two ; and all, after passing Tcross the back of the hand, are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the fingers m the following manner- Each tendon becomes narrow and thickened opposite the metacarpo- phalangeal articulation, and gives oiF a thin fasciculus upon each side of the joint, which serves as the posterior ligament; after having passed the joint, it spreads out into a broad aponeurosis, which covers the whole of the dorsal surface of the first phalanx ; being reinforced, in this situation, by the tendons of the Interossei and Lubricales. Opposite the first phalangeal joint, this aponeurosis divides mto three slips a middle, and two "lateral: the former is inserted into the base of the second phalanx; and the two lateral, wHch are continued onwards along the sides of the second phalanx, unite by their contiguous margins, and are inserted into the dorsal surface of the last phalanx. As the tendons cross the phalangeal joints, they furmsh them with posterior ligaments. The tendons of the middle, ring, and little fingers are connected together, as they cross the hand, by small oblique tendmous slips. The tendons of the index and little fingers also receive, before then- division, the special extensor tendons belonging to them. „ , p j -u j Belations.

Ihe anterior and posterior angular ligaments, and the palmar fascia, should then bo dissected. The Anterior Annular Ligament is a strong fibrous band, which arches over the carpus, converting the deep groove on the front of the carpal bones into a canal, beneath which pass the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is attached, internally, to the pisiform bone, and unciform process of the unciform ; and externally, to the tuberosity of the scaphoid, and ridge on the trapezium. It is continuous, above, with the deep fascia of the forearm, and below, with the palmar fascia. It is crossed by the ulnar vessels and nerve, and the cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves. It has inserted into its upper and inner part the tendon of the Palmaris longus and part of the tendon of the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; and has, arising from it below, the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. It is pierced by the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis ; and, beneath it, pass the tendons of the Flexor sublimis and profundus digitorum, the Flexor longus pollicis,and the median nerve. There are two synovial membranes beneath this ligament; one of large size, enclosing the tendons of the Flexor sublimis and profundus ; and a sepa- rate one for the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis, which is also very extensive, reaching from above the wrist to the extremity of the last phalanx of the thumb. The Posterior Annular Li- 176. — Transverse Section through the Wrist, showing the Annular Ligaments and the Canals for the Passage of the Tendons. gament is a strong fibrous band, extending transversely across the back of the wrist, and continuous with the fascia of the forearm. It forms a sheath for the extensor ten- dons in their passage to the fingers, being attached, inter- nally, to the ulna, the cunei- form and pisiform bones, and palmar fascia; externally, to the margin of the radius : and in its passage across the wrist, to the elevated ridges on the posterior surface of the radius. It presents six compartments for the passage of tendons, each of which is lined by a separate synovial membrane. These are, from without inwards-i.

The LumhricaUs {^g. 177) are four small fleshy fasciculi, accessories to the deep Flexor muscle. They arise by fleshy fibres from the tendons of the deep Flexor : the first and second, from the radial side and palmar surface of the tendons of the index and middle fingers ; the third, from the contiguous sides of the tendons of the middle and ring fingers ; and the fourth, from the contiguous sides of the tendonsof thering and little fingers. They pass forwards to the radial side of the cor- responding fingers, and opposite the meta- carpo-phalangeal articulation each tendon terminates in a broad aponeurosis, which is inserted into the tendinous expansion from the Extensor communis digitorum, covering the dorsal aspect of each finger. The Interossei Muscles are so named from occupying the intervals between the metacarpal bones. They are divided into two sets, a dorsal and palmar; the former are four in number, one in each metacar- pal space ; the latter, three in number, lie upon the metacarpal bones. The Dorsal Interossei are four in num- ber, larger than the palmar, and occupy the intervals between the metacarpal bones. They are bipenniform muscles, arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones, but more extensively from that side of the meta- carpal bone which corresponds to the side of the finger in which the mascle is inserted. They are inserted into the base of the first phalanges and into the apo- neurosis of the common Extensor tendon. Between the double origin of each of these muscles is a narrow triangular interval, through which passes a perforating branch from the deep palmar arch. The First Dorsal Interosseous muscle, or Abductor indicis, is larger than the others. It is flat, triangular in form, and arises by two heads, separated by a •fibrous arch for the passage of the radial artery from the dorsum to the palm of the hand. The outer head arises from the upper half of the ulnar border of the first metacarpal bone; the inner head, from almost the entire length of the radial border of the^second metacarpal bone; the tendon is inserted into the radial side of he index finger Ihe second and third dorsal interossei are inserted into the I'vf T''; T '"i*" i^to ulnar side.

The first arises from the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone, and is in- serted into the same side of tlio index finger. The second arises from the radial side of the fourth metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the same side of the ring- finger. Tho third arises from the radial side of the fifth metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the same side of tho little finger, i'rom this account it may be seen, that each finger is provided with two Interossei muscles, with the excep- tion of the little finger, in which the Abductor muscle takes the place of oneof the pair. Nerves. The two outer Lumbricales are supplied by the median nerve; the rest of the muscles of this group, by the ulnar. Actions. The Dorsal interossei muscles abduct the fingers from an imaginary line drawn longitudinally through the centre of the middle finger ; and the Palmar interossei adduct the fingers towards that line. They usually assist the Extensor muscles; but when the fingers are slightly bent, they assist in flexing them. The action of the Lumbricales and Internal or Dorsal interossei is said by Hunter to be to flex the first phalanges, and extend the last two (works by Palmer, iv. 237) ; and Cleland supports this (' Journ. of Anat. and Phys.' Old series, i. 85). In the last edition of Quain's ' Anatomy,' p. 229, it is said that the Lumbricales, assisted by the Interossei, flex the first phalanges, and at the same time by their connection with the Extensor tendon, extend the other phalanges.* SURGICAL ANATOMY. The Student, having completed the dissection of the muscles of the upper extremity, .should consider the eifects likely to be produced by the action of the various muscles m fracture of the bones. In considering the actions of the various muscles upon fractures of the upper extremity, i have selected the most common forms of injury, both for illustration and description. Fracture of the clavicle is an exceedingly common accident, and is usually caused by indi- rect violence, as a fall upon the shoulder; it occasionally, however, occurs from direct force. Its more usual situation is just external to the centre of the bone, but it may occur at the sternal or acromial end. , , ., 1.1 j- Fracture of the middle of the clavicle (fig. 180) is always attended with considerable dis- • M. Duchenne gives a different account of the mechanism of the extension of the fingers and of the action of the Interossei muscles from that usually accepted. According to him, the Extensor communis digitorum acts almost entirely on the first phalanges, extension of the second and third phalanges being effected bv the Interossei muscles, which also act to a certain extent as flexors of the first phalanges. 'This action of the Interossei is additional to their action in abduction and adduction ('Thysiologie des Mouvements,' pp. 261-298). M. Duchenne's view of the action of these muscles certainly derives support from the phenomena observed in lead-palsy and from the results of galvanising the common Extensor and the Interossei, as Dr. W. Ogle has been kind enough to point out to me. Thus also in a case related by Mr. Hutchinson, in which the ulnar nerve had been divided below the part 'rom which the Extensor communis was supplied, (and therefore the Interossei were parwysea while the Extensor acted),' the first phalanges were bent backwards on tho metacarpal bones (extended) ' while the fingers were curved into tho palm' (second and third phalanges nexea;.

The outer fragment is drawn down by the weight of the ann, and tlie action of the Deltoid, and forwards and inwards by the Pectoralis minor and Sub- clavius muscles : the inner fragment is slightly raised by the Steruo-cleido-iuastoid, but only to a very limited extent, as the attachment of the costo-clavicular ligament and Pectoralis major below and in front would prevent any very great displacement upwards. The causes of displacement having been ascertained, it is easy to apply the appropnate treatment. The outer fragment is to be drawn outwards, and together with the scapula, raised upwards to a level with the inner fragment, and retained in that position. In fracture of the acromial end of theclaoick, between the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, only slight displacement occurs, as these ligaments, from their oblique insertion, serve to hold both portions of the bone in apposition. Fracture, also of the stmial end, internal to the costo-clavicular ligament, is attended with only slight displacement, this ligament serving to retain the fragments in close appo- sition. Fracture of the acromion process usually arises from violence applied to the upper and outer part of the shoulder; it is generally known by the rotundity of the shoulder being lost, from the Deltoid drawing the fractured portion downwards and forwards ; and the dis- placement may easily be discovered by tracing the margin of the clavicle outwards, when the fragment will be found resting on the front and upper part of the head of the humerus. In order to relax the anterior and outer fibres of the Deltoid (the opposing muscle), the arm should be drawn forwards across the chest, and the elbow well raised, so that the head of the bone may press the acromion process upwards and retain it in its position. Fracture of the coracoid jjrocess is an ex- tremely rare accident, and is usually caused by a sharp blow on the point of the shoulder. Displacement is here produced by the com- bined actions of the Pectoralis minor, short head of the Biceps, and Coraco-brachialis, the former muscle drawing the fragment inwards, and the latter dh-ectly downwards, the amount of displacement being limited by the connec- tion of this process to the acromion by means of the coraco-acromial ligament. In order to relax these muscles and replace the fragments in close apposition, the forearm should be flexed so as to relax the Biceps, and the arm drawn forwards and inwards across the chest so as to relax the Coraco-brachialis; the humerus should then be pushed upwards against the coraco-acromial ligament, and the arm retained in that position. r racture of the anato^nical neck of the htimerus within the capsular ligament is a rare accident, attended with very slight displace- ment, an impaired condition of the motions of the joint, and crepitus. Fracture of the surgical neck (fig. 181) is very common, is attended with considerable displacement, and its appearances correspond somewhat with those of dislocation of the head of the humerus into the axilla. The upper fragment is slightly elevated under the coraco-acromial ligament by the muscles at- tached to the greater and lesser tuberosities ; the lower fragment is drawn inwards by the Pectoralis major, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major; and the humerus is thrown obliquety outwards from the side by the Deltoid, and occasionally elevated so as to project be- neath and in front of the coracoid process. The deformity is reduced by fixing the shoulder, and drawing the arm outwards and downwards. To counteract the opposing muscles, and to keep the fragments in posi- tion, the arm should be drawn from the side, and pasteboard splints applied on its four u 181.—Fracture of the Surgical Neck of the Humerus.SURGICAL ANATOMY. 290 • 1 1 J c,i.m,l,1 ho lilftcod in the axilla with thobaB© turned upwards, sides ala^rgGConical-slmpcd padshou d bo^^^^^^^^^^ by a broad roller passect round and the elbow approxunated to o f' an^ r ^^^^^ ^^.ported in a sling, care being the cliest; the lorcarni should then b" ^v„„mAni- mav be disnlaced uDwards.

The patient at the same time loses", more or less, the power of extending the forearm. The treatment consists in relaxing the Triceps by extending the limb, and retaining it in the extended position by means of a long straight splint applied to tlie front of the urni; the fragments are thus brought into close apposition, and may be further approximated by draw- ing down the upper fragments. Union is generally ligamentous. Fracture of the neck of the raclim is an exceedingly rare accident, and is generally caused by direct violence. Its diagnosis is somewhat obscure, on account of the slight deformity visible: the injured part being surrounded by a large number of muscles; but the movements of pronation and supination are entirely lost. The upper fragment is drawn outwards by the Supinator bevis, its extent of displacement being limited by the attachment of the orbicular ligament. The lower fragment is drawn forwards and slightly upwards by the Biceps, and inwards by the Pronator radii teres, its displacement forwards and upwards being counteracted in some degree by the Supinator brevis. The treatment essentially consists in relaxing the Biceps, Supinator brevis, and Pronator radii teres muscles, by flexing the forearm, and placing it in a position midway between pronation and supination, extension having been previously made so as to bring the parts in apposition. Fracture of the radius (fig. 184) is more 184.—Fracture of the Shaft of the Radius, common than fracture of the ulna, on ac- count of the connection of the former bone with the wrist. Fracture of the shaft of the radius near its centre may occur from direct violence, but more frequently from a fall forwards, the weight of the body being received on the wrist and hand. The upper fragment is drawn upwards by the Biceps, and inwards by the Pro- nator radii teres, holding a position mid- way between pronation and supination, and a degree of fulness in the upper half of the forearm is thus produced : the lower fragment is drawn downwards and inwards towards the ulna by the Pronator quadratus, and thrown into a state of pronation by the same muscle; at the same time, the Supinator longus, by elevating the styloid process, into which it is inserted, will serve to depress the upper end of the lower fragment still more towards the ulna. In order to relax the opposing muscle the forearm should be bent, and the limb placed in a position midway between pronation and supination ; the fracture is then easily reduced by extension from the wrist and elbow : well-padded splints should then be applied on both sides of the forearm from the elbow to the wrist; the hand being allowed to fall, will, by its own weio'ht counteract the action of the Pronator quadratus and Supinator longus, and elevate the lower fragment to the level of the upper one. Fracture of the shaft of the ulna is not a common accident; it is usually caused by direct violence. The more protected position of the ulna on the inner side of the limb the greater strength of its shaft, and its indirect connection with the wrist, render it less liable to injury than the radius. The fracture usually occurs a little below the middle which is the weakest part of the bone. The upper fragment retains its usual position! but the lower fragment is drawn outwards towards the radius by the Pronator quadratus producmg a well-marked depression at the seat of fracture, and some fulness on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the forearm. The fracture is easily reduced by extension from the wnst and forearm. The forearm should be flexed, and placed in a position midway between pronation and supination, and well-padded splints applied from the elbow to the ends of the Fracture of t\i& shafts of the radius and ulna together is not a very common accident; it may arise from a direct blow, or from indirect violence.

Fracture of the lower end of the. rmlim (lig. 185) is usually called Colles's fracture, from the name of the oniinent Duhlin Hurgeou who first accurately described it. It is generally produced by the patient falling upon tlie hand, which receives tlio entire weight of the body. This fracture usually takes ])lace from half an inch to an inch above the articular eurfaco if it occurs in the adult; hut in the child, before the age of sixteen, it is more frequently a separation of the epiphysis from the diaphysis. The displacement which is produced is very considerable, and bears some resemblance to dislocation of the carpus backwards, from which it should be carefully distinguished. The lower fi-agment is drawn jgj.—Fracture of the Lower End of the Radius. upwards and backwards behind the upper fragment by the Combined acfions of the Supmator longus and the flexors and the extensors of the thumb and carpus, producing a well-marked prominence on the back of the wrist, with a deep depression above it. The upper fragment projects forwards, often lacerating the substance of the Pronator quadratus, and is drawn by this muscle into close contact with the lower end of the ulna, causing a projection on the anterior surface of the forearm, immediately above the carpus, from the flexor tendons beinc thrust forwards. This fracture may be distinguished from dislocation by the de- foruiity beino- removed on making sufficient extension, when crepitus may be occasionally detected ; at'the same time, on extension being discontinued, the parts immediately resume their deformed appearance. The age of the patient will also assist in determining whether the iniury is fracture or separation of the epiphysis. The treatment consists in flexing the forearm, and making powerful extension from the wrist and elbow, depressing at the same time the radial side of the hand, and retaining the parts in that position by well-padded 2yistol-shaped splints.

No detailed description is required for the dissection of these muscles. On the removal of the viscera from the abdomen, they are exposed, covered by the peritoneum and a thin layer of fascia, the fascia iliaoa. The iliac fascia is the aponeurotic layer which lines, the back part of the abdominal cavity, and covers the Psoas and Iliacus mxiscles throughout their whole extent. It is thin above; and becomes gradually thicker below, as it approaches the femoral arch. The pm-tion investing the Psoas, is attached, above, to the ligamentum arcuatum internum; internally, to the sacrum ; and by a series of arched processes to the intervertebral substances, and prominent margins of the bodies of the vertebrte; the intervals so left, opposite the constricted portions of the bodies, transmitting the lumbar arteries and filaments of the sympathetic nerve. Externally, this portion of the iliac fascia is continuous with the fascia lumborum. The portion investing the Iliacus is connected, externally, to the vyhole length of the inner border of the crest of the ilium; and internally to tlT,e brim of the true pelvis, where it is continuous with the periosteum, and repeives the tendon of insertion of the Psoas parvus, when that muscle exists. External to the femoral vessels, this fascia is intimately connected with Poupart's ligament, and is con- tinuous with the fascia transversalis ; but, as the femoral vessels, pass down into the thigh, it is prolonged down behind them, forming the posterior wall of the femoral sheath. Outside the femoral sheath, the ihac fa,scia surrounds the Psoas and Iliacus muscles to their termination, and becomes continuous with the Iliac portion of the fascia lata. Internal to the femoral vessels, the iliac fascia is connected to the ilio-pectineal line, and is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The external ihac vessels He in front of the ili^o fascia, but all the branches of the lumbar plexus behind it; it is separated from the peritoneum by a quantity of loose areolar tissue. In a,bscess accompanying caries of the lower part of the spine, the matter makes its way to the femoral arch, distending the sheath of the Psoas ; and when it accumulates in. considerable quantity, this muscle becomes absorbed, and the nervous cords contained in it are dissected out, and are exposed in the cavity of the abscess ; the femoral vessels, however, remain intact, and the peri- toneum seldom becomes implicated. Remove this fascia, and the muscles of the iliac region will be exposed. The Psoas Magnus (fig. 187) is a long fusiform muscle, placed on the side of294 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE. the lumbar region of the spine and margin of tbo pelvis It arises ft-om the sides of the bodies, from the corresponding intervertebral subs ances, and from the front of the bases of the transverse processes of the last dorsal and aAl the lumbar ver- tebra,.

To expose the muscles and fasciae in this region, make an incision along Pou- part's ligament, fi'om the spine of the ilium to the pubes, a vertical incision from the centre of this, along the middle of the thigh to below the knee-joint, and a transverse incision from the inner to the outer side of the leg, at the lower end of the vertical incision. The flaps of integument having been removed, the superficial and deep fasciee should be examined. The more advanced student should commence the study of this region by an examination of the anatomy of femoral her- flia, and Scarpa's triangle, the incisions for the dissection of which are marked out in the accompanying figure. Dissection of FEMORAL HERNIA, &. SCARPAS TRIANQVE 2.. FRONT jfTHICH S . FRONT^ LEG ^ . DORSUMof rOOT Fascia, of the Thigh. The superficial fascia forms a con- tinuous layer over the whole of the lower extremity, consisting of areolar tis- sue, containing in its meshes much adipose matter, and capable of being separated into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves. It varies in thickness, in difier- ent parts of the limb ; in the sole of the foot it is so thin as to be scarcely demon- strable, the integument being closely ad- herent to the deep fascia beneath, but in the groin it is thicker, and the two layers are separated from one another by the superficial inguinal glands, the internal saphenous vein, and several smaller ves- sels. One of these two layers, the super- ficial, is continuous above with the super- ficial fascia of the abdomen, the deep layer becoming blended with the fascia lata, a little below Poupart's ligament. The deep layer of superficial fascia is in- timately adherent to the margins of the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and pierced in. this situation by numerousMUSCLES AND FASCTyE. 296 small blood and lymphatic vcssols : honco tho iiamo cribriform fascia, -vvlucli lias boon applied to it. Subcutaneous bursa; are found in tbo superficial fascia over the patella, point of the heel, and pha- lanp-eal articulations of the toos. Tho deep fascia of the thigh is exposed on the removal of the superficial fascia, and is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata ; it forms a uniform investment for tho whole of this region of the limb, but varies in thickness in difl^erent parts ; thus, it is thicker in the upper and outer part' of the thigh, where it receives a fibrous expansion from the Gluteus maxi- mus muscle, and the Tensor vagince femoris is inserted between its layers : it is very thin behind, and at the upper and inner part, where it covers the Adductor muscles, and'again becomes stronger around the knee, receiving fibrous expansions from the tendon of the Biceps externally, and from the Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendi- nosus, and Quadriceps extensor cruris in front The fascia lata is attached, above, to Poupart's ligament, and the crest of the ilium; behind, to the margin of the sa- crum and coccyx ; internally, to the pubic arch, and linea ilio-pectinea; and below to all the prominent points around the knee- joint, the condyles ,of the femur, tubero- sities of the tibia, and head of the fibula. That portion which invests the Gluteus medius (\he Gluteal aponeurosis) is very thick and strong, and gives origin by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of that muscle; at the upper border of the Gluteus maximus, it divides into two layers the upper of which, very thm, covers the surface of the Gluteus maxi- mus, and is continuous below with the fascia lata: the deep layer is thick above, where it blends with the great sacro- sciatic ligament, thin below, where it se- parates the Gluteus maximus from the deeper muscles. From the inner surface of the fascia lata are given off two strong intermuscular septa, which are attached to the whole length of the linea aspera : tho external and stronger one, which extends from the insertion of the Gluteus maximus to the outer condyle, separates the Vastus externus in front from the short head of the Biceps behind, and gives partial ori- gin to those muscles; the inner one, he thinner of the two, separates the Vastus internus from the Adductor muscles. 187.—MusclANTERIOR FEMORAL REGION. 297 :Besicles these, there are numerous smaller septa, separating the individual muscles, and enclosing each in a distinct sheath. At the upper and inner part of the thigh, a little below Poupart's ligament, a large oval-shaped aperture is observed after the superficial fascia has been cleared off: it transmits the internal saphenous vein, and other smaller vessels, and is termed the saphenous opening. In order more correctly to consider the mode of formation of this aperture, the fascia lata is described as consisting, in this part of the thigh, of two portions, an lUao por- tion, and a pubic portion. The iliac portion is all that part of the fascia lata on the outer side of the saphenous opening. It is attached, externally, to the crest of the ilium, and its anterior superior spine, to the whole length of Poupart's ligament, as far internally as the spine of the pubes, and to the pectineal line in conjunction with Gimbernat's ligament. From the spine of the pubes, it is reflected downwards and outwards, forming an arched margin, the superior cornu, or outer boundary of the saphenous opening ; this margin overlies, and is adherent to the anterior layer of the sheath of the femoral vessels; to its edge is attached- the cribriform fascia, and, below, it is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The puhic portion is situated at the inner side of the saphenous opening ; at the lower margin of this aperture it is continuous with the iliac portion ; traced upwards, it is seen to cover the surface of the Pectineus muscle, and passing behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, to which it is closely united, is con- tinuous with the sheath of the Psoas and Iliacus muscles, and is finally lost in the fibrous capsule of the hip-joint. This fascia is attached above to the pectineal line in front of the insertion of the aponeurosis of the External oblique, and internally to the margin of the pubic arch. From this description it may be observed, that the ihac portion of the fascia lata passes in front of the femoral vessels, and the pubic portion behind them, so that an apparent aperture exists between the two, through which the internal saphenous joins the femoral vein.f The fascia should now be removed from the surface of the muscles. This may be effected by pinching it up between the forceps, dividing it, and separating it from each"muscle in the course of its fibres. The Tensor Vacjince Femoris is a short flat, muscle, situated at the upper and outer side of the thigh. It arises from the anterior part of the outpr lip of the crest of the ihum, and from the outer surface of the anterior superior spinous 'process, between the Gluteus medius and Sartorius. The muscle passes obliquely downwards, and a little backwards, to be inserted into the fascia lata, about one- fourth down the .outer side of the thigh. Relations.

The Sartorius, the longest muscle in the body, is flat, narrow, and riband-like : it arises by tendinous fibres from the anterior superior spinous process of the ihum and the upper half of the notch below it, passes obliquely across the upper and anterior part of the thigh, from the outer to the inner side of the limb, then descends vertically, as far as the inner side of the knee, passing behind the inner condyle of the femur, and terminates in a tendon, which, curving obli(jue]y for- wards, expands into a broad aponeurosis, inserted into the upper part of thp inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, nearly as far forwards as the crest. This expan- sion covers the insertion of the tendons'of tliie Gracilis and Semitendinosus, with which it IS partially united, a synovial bursa being interposed between them. An ofi-set is derived from the upper margin of this aponeurosis, which blonds with • These parts will be again more particularly described with the .anatomy .of Heiuia,MUSCLES AND FASCIA. 298 tbo fibrous capsule of the knee-joint, and another, given off from its lower border, blends with the fascia on the inner side of the leg. The relations of this muscle to the femoral artery should be carefully examined, as its inner border forms the chief guide in tying the artery. In the upper third of the thigh, it forms the outer side of a triangular space, Scarpa's triangle, the inner side of which is formed by the Adductor lougus, and the base, turned upwards, by Poupart's ligament; the femoral artery passes perpendicularly through the middle of this space from its base to its apex. In the middle third of the thigh, the femoral artery lies first aloiig the inner border, and then behind the Sartorius. J^elations. By its su;perficAal surface^ with the fascia lata and integument.

Gracilis, long saphenous nerve, and internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. The Quadnoeps extensor includes the four remaining muscles on the front of the thigh. It is the great Extensor muscle of the leg, forming a large fleshy mass, which covers the front and sides of the femur, being united below into a single tendon, attached to the tibia, and above subdividing into separate portions, which have received distinct names. Of these, one occupying the middle of the thigh, connected above with the ilium, is called the Rectus femoris, from its straight course. The other divisions lie in immediate connection with the shaft of the femur, which they cover from the condyles to the trochanters, The portion on the outer side of the femur is termed the Vast^ls externus ; that covering the inner side, the Vastus intern%is; and that covering the front of the femur, the Grureus. The two latter portions are, however, so intimately blended, as to form but one muscle. The Rectus femoris is situated in the middle of the anterior region of the thigh ; it is fusiform in shape, and its fibres are arranged in a bipenniform manner. It arises by two tendons : one, the straight tendon, or short head, from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium; the other is flattened, and curves outwards, to be attached to a groove above the brim of the acetabulum ; this is the reflected tendon, or long head, o,f the Rectus ; it unites with the straight tendon at an acute angle, and then spreads into an aponeurosis, from which the muscular fibres arise. The muscle terminates in a broad and thick aponeurosis, which, occupies the lower two-thirds of its posterior surface, and gradually becoming narrowed into a flattened tendon, is inserted into, the patella in common with the Yasti and Crureus. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the anterior fibres of the Glutens minimus, the Tensor vaginee femoris, Sartorius, and the Psoas and Iliacus; by its lower three-fourths, with the fascia lata. By its posterior surface, with the hip- joint, the external circumflex vessels, and the Crureus and Vasti muscles. The three remaining muscles have been described collectively by some anatomists, separate from the Rectus, under the name of the Triceps extensor cruris ; in order to expose them, divide the Sartorius and Rectus across the middle, and turn them aside, when the muscles in question will be fully brought into view. The Vastus externus is the largest part of the Quadriceps extensor. It arises by a broad aponeurosis, which is attached to the tubercle of the femur, to the anterior border of the great trochanter, to a horizontal ridge on its outer surface, to a rough line leading from the trochanter major to the linea aspera, and to the whole length of the outer lip of the linea aspera; this aponeurosis covers the upper three-fourths of the miiscle, and from its inner surface many fibres arise. A few additional fibres arise ft'om the tendon of the Gluteus maximus, and from the external intermuscular septum between the Vastus externus, and short head of the Biceps. The fibres form a large fleshy mass, which is attached to a strong aponeurosis, placed on the under surface of the muscle at its lower part: this becomes contracted and thickened into a flat tendon, which is inserted into the outer border of the patella, blending with the great extensor tendon.

By its dee'p siirface, with the Crareus, some large branches of the external circumflex artery and anterior crai-al nerve being interposed. The Vastus Interims and Gnireus are so inseparably connected together, as to form but one muscle, as which it will be accordingly desciibed. It is the smallest portion of the Quadriceps extensor. The anterior portion of it, covered by the Rectus,.is called the Crureus ; the internal portion, which lies immediately beneath the fascia lata, the Vastus Internus. It arises by an aponeurosis, which is attached to the lower part of the line that extends from the inner side of the neck of the femur to the linea aspera, from the whole length of the inner lip of the linea aspera, and internal intermuscular septum. It also arises from nearly the whole of the internal, anterior, and external surfaces of the shaft of the femur, limited, above, by the line between the two trochanters, and extending, below, to within tKe lower fourth of the bone. From those different origins, the fibres converge to a broad aponeurosis, which covers the anterior surface of the middle portion of the muscle (the Crureus), and the deep surface of the inner division of the muscle (the Vastus internus), and which gradually narrows down to its insertion into the patella, where it blends with the other portions of the Quadriceps extensor. Belations, By its stiperjicial surface, with the Psoas and Iliacus, the Rectus, Sartorius, Pectineus, Adductors, and fascia lata, femoral vessels, and saphenous nerve. By its deep surface, with the femur, Subcrureus, and synovial membrane of , the knee-joint. The student will observe the striking analogy that exists between the Quadriceps extensor and the Triceps muscle in the upper extremity. So close is this simi- larity, that M. Cruveilhier has described it under the name of the Triceps femoralis. Like the Triceps brachiahs, it consists of three distinct divisions, or heads : a middle or long head, analogous to the long head of the Triceps, attached to the ilium, and two other portions which may be called the external and internal heads of the Triceps femorahs. These, it will be noticed, are strictly analogous to the outer and inner heads of the Triceps brachialis. The tendons of the different portions of the Quadriceps extensor unite at the lower part of the thigh, so as to form a single strong tendon, which is inserted into the upper part of the patella. More properly, the patella may be regarded as a sesamoid bone, developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps; and the Hgamentum patellae, which is continued from the lower part of the patella to the tuberosity of the tibia, as the proper tendon of insertion of the muscle. A synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon and the upper part of the tuberosity of the tibia. From the tendons corresponding to the Vasti, a fibrous prolongation is derived,' which is attached below to the upper extremities of the tibia and fibula, and which serves to protect the knee-joint, being strengthened on its outer side by the fascia lata. The Subcrureus is a small muscle, usually distinct from the Crureus but occa- sionally blended with it, which arises from the anterior surface of the lower part of the shaft of the femur, and is inserted into the upper part of the synovial pouch that extends upwards from the knee-joint behind the patella. It sometimes consists 01 two separate muscular bundles. Nerves.

It is thin and flattened, broad above, "narrow and tapering below. It arises by a thin aponeurosis between two and three inches in breadth, from the inner margin of the ramus of the pubes and ischium. The fibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a rounded tendon wHcb passes behind tbe internal condyle of the femur, and curving round the inner tuberosity of the tibia, becomes flattened, and is inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, below the tuberosity.

The Adductor Longus, the most superficial of the three Adductofs, is a flat triangular muscle, lying on the same plane as the Pectineus, with which it is often blended above. It arises, by a flat narrow tendon, from the front of the pubes, at the angle of junction of the crest with the symphisis ; and soon expands into a broad fleshy belly, which, passing downwards, backwards, and outwards, is inserted, by an aponeurosis, into the middle third of the linea aspera, between the Vastus internus and the Adductor magnus.

The Pectineus and Adductor longus should now be divided near their origin, and turned downwards, when the Adductor brevis and Obturator externus will be exposed. The Adductor Brevis is situated immediately behind the two preceding muscles. It is somewhat triangular in form, and arises by a narrow origin from the outer surface of the descending ramus of the pubes, between the Gracilis and Obturator externus. Its fibres, passing backwards, outwards, and downwards, are inserted, by an aponeurosis, into the upper part of the linea aspera, immediately behind the Pectineus and upper part of the Adductor longus. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the Pectineus, Adductor longus-, and anterior branches of the obturator vessels and nerve.

By its o^der border, with the Obturator externus, and conjoined tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus. By its inner border, with the Gracilis and Adductor magnus. This muscle is pierced, near its insertion, by the middle perforating branch of the profunda ai-tery. The Adductor brevis should now he cut away near its origin, and turned outwards when the entire extent of the Adductor magnus will he exposed. ' The Adductor Magmis is a large triangular muscle, forming Ji septum between the muscles on the inner and those on tke back of t!be thigh. It arises from a small part of the descending ramus of the pubes, from the ascending ramus of the ischium, and from the outer margin and under surface of the tuberosity of the ischium. Those fibres which arise from the ramus of the pubes are very short horizontal m direction, and are inserted into the rough line leading from the great trochanter to the Imea aspera, internal to the Gluteus maximus; those from the ramus of the ischium are directed downwards and outwards with different degrees of obhquity, to be mserted, by means of a broad aponeurosis, inte the whole length of the Imea aspera and the upper part of its internal bifurcation below. The. internal portion of the muscle, consisting principally of those fibres which arise from the tuberosity of the ischium forms a thick fleshy mass consisting of coarse bundles which descend almost vertically, and terminate about the lower third of the thigh m a rounded tendon, which is inserted into the tubercle above the inner condyle, of tbe femur, bemg connected by a fibrous expansion to the line leading upwards from the tubercle to the linea aspera.

It arises from the fr-ont of the sacram by three fleshy dicritatioiis, attached to the portions of bone between the first, second, third, and fourth anterior sacral foramina, and also from the grooves leading from the foramina: a few fibres also arise from the margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The muscle passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, the upper part of which it fills, and is inserted by a rounded tendon into the upper border of the great trochanter, being generally blended with the tendon of the Obturator internus.

Dissection. The next muscle, as well as the origin of the Pyriformis, can only be seen when the pelvis is divided, and the viscera removed. The Obturator menibrane is a dense layer of interlacing fibres, which completely closes the obturator foramen, except at its upper and outer part, where a small oval canal is left for the obturator vessels and nerve.. Each obturator muscle is connected with this membrane. The Obturator Internus, like the preceding muscle, is situated partly within the cavity of the pelvis, partly at the back of the hip-joint. It arises from the inner surface of the anterior and external wall of the. pelvis, around the inner side of the obturator foramen, being attached to the descending ramus of the pubes, and the ascending ramus of the ischium, and at the side to. the inner surface of the body of the ischium, between the margin of the obturator foramen in front, the great sacro-sciatic notch behind^, and the brim of the true pelvis above. It also arises from the inner surface of the obturator membrane and from the ten- dinous arch which completes the canal for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. The fibres are directed backwards and downwards, and terminate in four or five tendinous bands, which are found on its deep sarface; these bands are reflected at a right angle over the inner surface of the tuberosity of the isehium, which is grooved for their reception : the groove is covered with cartilage, and lined with a synovial bursa. The-muscle leaves the pelvis by the lesser sacro-sciatic notch ; and the tendinous bands unite into a single flattened tendon, which passes horizontally outwards, and, after receiving the attachment of the Gemelli,, is. in- serted into the upper border of the great trochanter in front of the Pyriformis. A synovial bursa, narrow and elongated in form, is usually found between the tendon of this muscle and thfe capsular ligament of the hip : it occasionally communicates with that between the tendon and the tuberosity of the ischium, the two. forming; a single sac. ™„Jf\°j5-'-5°f'^'^-.*''-^ P"^"^^' appearances presented by the tendon of this muscle, ife must be divided near its insertion and reflected outwards.

It arises from the outer border of the tuberosity of the ischium, and proceeding horizontally outwards is inserted into the upper part of the linea quadrati, on the posterior surface of the trochanter major. A synovial bursa is often found between the under surface of this muscle and the lesser trochanter, which it covers. Belations.

In order to expose the next muscle (the Obturator externus), it is necessary to remove the Psoas, Iliacus, Pectineiis, and Adductor brevis and longus muscles from the front and inner side of the thigh; and the Gluteus maximus and Quadratus femoris from the back part. Its dissection should consequently he postponed until the muscles of the anterior and internal femoral regions have been examined. The Obturator Externus (fig. i88) is a flat triangular muscle, which covers the outer surfece of the anterior wall of the pelvis. It arises from the margin of bone immediately around the inner side of the obturator foramen, viz., from the body and ramus of the pubes, and the ramus of the ischium; it also arises from the inner two-thirds of the outer surface of the obturator membrane, and from the ten- dinous arch which completes the canal for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves. The fibres converging pass outwards and backwards, and terminate in a tendon which runs across the back part of the hip-joint, and is inserted into the digital fossa of the femur. Belations.

The Gluteus maximus is supplied by the infen'or gluteal nerve and a TDraneh from the sacral plexus; the Gluteus racdius and minimus, by the superiiM- gluteal; the Pyriformis, Gemclli, Obturator internus, and Quadratus femons, by TDTOUchcs from the sacral plexus, and the Obturator externus, by the obturator nerve. , . o i • Actions. The Glutei muscles, when they take their fixed pomt from the pelns are all abductors of tho thigh. The Gluteus maximus and the postenor fibres olPOSTERIOR FEMORAL REGION. 307 the Gluteus modius, rotate tlie thigli outwards ; the anterior fibres of tlic Gluteus medius and the Gluteus minimus rotate it inwards. The Gluteus maximus serves to extend the femur, and the Gluteus medius and minimus draw it forwards. The Gluteus maximus is also a tensor of the fascia lata. Taking their fixed point from the femur, the Glutei muscles act upon the pelvis, su^pporting it and the whole trunk upon the head of the femur, which is specially obvious in standing on one leg. In order to gain the erect posture after tlie effort of stooping, these muscles draw the pelvis backAvards, assisted by the Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semi- membranosus muscles. The remaining muscles are powerful rotators of the thigh outwards. In the sitting posture, when the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis, their action as rotators ceases, and they become abductors, with the exception of the Obturator externus, which still rotates the femur outwards. When the femur is, fixed, the Pyriformis and Obturator muscles serve to draw the pelvis forwards if it has been inclined backwards, and assist in steadying it upon the head of the femur. Posterior Femoral Region. Biceps. Semitendinosus. Semimembranosufi. Dissection (fig. 189). Make a vertical incision along the middle of the thigh, from the lower fold of the nates to about three inches below the back of the knee-joint, and there connect it with a transverse incision, carried from the inner to the outer side of the leg. Make a third incision ti-ansversely at the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thigh. The integument having been removed from the back of the knee, and the boundaries of the popliteal space examined, the removal of the integument from the remaining part of the thigh should be continued, when the fascia and muscles of this region will be exposed. The Biceps (fig. 190) is a large muscle, of considerable length, situated on the posterior and outer aspect of the thigh. It arises by two heads. One, the long head, arises from the lower and inner facet on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the Semitendinosus. The femoral, or short head, arises from the outer lip of the linea aspera, between the Adductor magnus and Vaf?tus externus, extending from a short distance below the insertion of the Gluteus maximus, to within two inches of the outer condyle ; it also arises from the external intermuscular septum. The fibres of the long head form a fusiform belly, which, passing obliquely downwards and a little outwards, terminate in an aponeu- rosis which covers the posterior surface of the muscle, and receives the fibres of the short head; this aponeurosis becomes gradually contracted into a tendon, which is inserted into the outer side of the head of the, fibula. At its insertion, the tendon divides into two portions, which embrace the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint, a strong prolongation being sent forwards to the outer tuberosity of the tibia, which gives ofi" an expansion to the fascia of the leg. The tendon of this muscle forms the outer ham-string. -■ Relations. By its superficial siwface, with the Gluteus maximus above the fascia lata and integument in the rest of its extent.

' By its deei) surface, with the Scniiinonibraiiosus, Adductcu- magiius, inner head of the Gastrocnemius, and internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. The Semimemhmnosus, so called from the membranous expansion on its anterior and posterior surfaces, is situated at the back part and inner side of the thigh. It arises by a thick tendon from the upper and outer facet on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, above and to the outer side of the Bieeps and Serai- tendinoBus, and is inserted \\\\o the inner and back part of the inner tuberosity of" the tibia, beneath the internal lateral ligament. The tendon of the muscle at its oiigin -expands into an aponeurosis, which covers the upper part of its anterior surface : from this aponeurosis, muscular fibres arise, and converge to another aponeurosis, which covers the lower part of its posterior surface and contracts into the tendon of insei'tion. The tendon of the muscle at its insertion divides imto three portions: the middle portion is the fasciculus of insertion into the back part of the inner tuberosity ; it sends down an expansion to covei- the Popliteus muscle. The internal portion is horizontal, passing forwards beneath the internal lateral ligament, to be inserted into a gi-oove along the inner side of the internal tuberosity. The posterior division passes upwards and backwards, to be inserted into the back part of the outer condyle of the femur, forming the chief part of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The tend ons of the two preceding muscles, with those of the Grraeilis and Sartorius, form the inner ham-string. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the Semitendinosus, Biceps, and fascia lata. By its deep surface, with the popliteal vessels^ Adductor magnus, and inner head of the Gastrocnemius, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa. By its innea- border, with the Gracilis. By its outer border, with the great sciatic nerve, and its internal popliteal branch. Nerves. The muscles of this region are supplied by the great sciatic nerve. Actions. The ham-string muscles flex the leg upon the thigh. When the knee is semi-flexed, the Biceps, in consequence of its oblique direction downwards and outwards, rotates the leg slightly outwards ; and the Semimembranosus, in consequence of its oblique direction, rotates the leg inwards, assisting the PopUteus. Taking their fixed point from below, these muscles serve to support the pelvis npon the head of the femur, and to draw the trunk directly backwards, as in feats of strength, when the body is thrown backwards in the form of an arch. Surgipol Anatomy. The tendons of these muscles oocnsionally require subcutaneous division in some forms of spm-ious anchj'losis of the knee-joint, dependent upon permfvnent contraction and rigidity of the Flexor muscles, or from stiflenLnfr of the ligamentous and other tissues surrounding the joint, the result of disease. This is effected by putting the tendon upon the stretch, and inserting a narrow sharp-pointed kuife between it and the skin: the cutting edge being then turned towards the tendon, it should be divided, taking cai'e that the wound in the slun is not at the same time enlarged. MnsciiEs AjjjD Fascm of the Leg. JDisscction (fig. i86). The knee should be bent, a block placed bene;ith it. and the foot kept in an extended position; then make an incision through the integument iu the middle line of the leg to the ankle, and cootinue it along the dorsum of the foot to the toes. Make a second incision transversely across the ankle, and a third in the same direction across the bases of the toes; remove the flaps of integument included between theae incisions, iu order to examine the deep fascia of the leg. The Fascia of the Leg forms a complete investment to the whole of this region of the limb, excepting to the inner surface of the tibia. It is continuous above with the fascia lata, receiving an expansion from the tendon of the Biceps on the : outer side, and from the tendons of the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semitendinosus on i the inner side ; in front it blends with the periosteum covering the tibia and . fibula; below, it is continuous with the annular ligaments of the ankle. It is thick and dense in the upper and anterior part of the leg, and gives attach-309 ANTERIOTi TrBIO-FIBULAR REGION. 191. -Muselea of tlie Front of tliB Leg. \ri5ii ment, by its deep surface, to the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorura muscles: but thinner behind, whore it covers the Grastrocne- mius and Soleus muscles. Its deep surface gives oS, on the outer side of the leg, two strong intermuscular septa, which enclose the Peronei muscles, and separate them from the muscles on the anterior and posterior tibial regions and several smaller and more slender processes, which enclose the individual muscles in each region; at the same time a broad transverse intermuscular septum, called the deep fascia of the leg, intervenes between the superficial and deep muscles in the posterior tibio-fibular region. Now remova the fascia by dividing it in the same direction as the integument, excepting opposite the ankle, where it should .be left entire. Commence the removal of the fascia from below, opposite the tendons, and detach it in the line of direction of the muscular iibres. Muscles op the Leg. These may be subdivided into three groups: those on the anterior, those on the posterior, and those on the outer side. Anterior Tibto-Fibular Region. Tibialis Anticus. Extensor Proprius PoUicis. Extensor Longus Digitoi'um. Peroneus Tertius. The Tibialis Anticus is situated on the outer side of the tibia ; it is thick and fleshy at its upper part, tendinous below. It arises from the outer tuberosity and upper two-thirds of the external surface of the shaft of the tibia ; from the adjoining part of the interosseous membrane ; from the deep surface of the fascia; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the Extensor longus digitorum: the fibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a tendon, which is apparent on the anterior surface of the muscle at the lower thii'd of the lea:. After passing through the innermost compart- ment of the anterior annular ligament, it is insei'ted into the inner and under surface of the internal cuneiform bone, and base of the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the fascia, and with the annular ligament. By its posterior surface, with the interosseous membrane, tibia, ankle joint, and inner side of the tarsus : this sui-face also overlaps the anterior tibial vessels and nerve in the upper part of the leg. By its inner surface, with the tibia. By its outer surface, with the Extensor longus digitorum, and Extensor propi-ius pol- licis, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve.MUSCLES AND FASCliE. The Extensor Proprius Polllcis is a tliin, elongalod, and flattened muscle, situated between the Tibialis antieus and ]Oxtensor longus digitoruni. It arises from tlio anterior surface of tlio fibula for about the middle two-fourths of its extent, ittt origin being intornal to that of the Extensor longus digitorum • it also arises from the iutorosseous membrane to a similar extent. The fibres pass downwards, and terminate in a tendon, which occupies the anterior border of the muscle, passes through a distinct compartment in the liorizontal portion of the annular ligament, crosses the anterior Tibial vessels near the bend of the ankle, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Opposite the metatarso-phalangeal articulation, the tendon gives off a thin prolongation on each side, which covers the surface of the joint. Itelatiuns. By its anterior border, with the fascia, and the anterior annular ligament. By its posterior border, with the interosseous membrane, fibula, tibia, ankle-joint, and Extensor brevis digitorum. By its outer side, with the Extensor longus digitorum above, the dor^alis pedis vessels and anterior tibial nerve below. By its irmer side, witk the Tibialis antieus and the anterior tibial vessels above. The Extensor Longus Digitorum is an elongated, flattened, semipenniform muscle, situated the most externally of all the muscles on the forepart of the leg. It arises from the outer tuberosity of the tibia; from the upper three-fourths of the anterior surface of the shaft of the fibula ; from the interosseous membrane, and deep surface of the fascia; and from the intermuscular septa between it and the Tibialis antieus on the inner, and the Peronei on the outer side. The muscle ter- minates in three tendons, which pass through a canal in the annular ligament, with the Peroneus tertius, run across the dorsum of the foot, and are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the four lesser toes, the innermost tendon being sub- divided into two. The mode in which the tendons are inserted is the following : Each tendon opposite the metatarso-phalangeal articulation is joined, on its outer side, by the tendon of the Extensor brevis digitorum (except the fourth), and receives a fibrous expansion from the Interossei and Lumbricales; it then spreads into a broad aponeurosis, which covers the dorsal surface of the first phalanx : this apo-. neurosis, at the articulation of the first with the second phalanx, divides into three slips, a middle one, which is inserted into the base of the second phalanx ; and two lateral slips, which, after uniting on the dorsal surface of the second phalanx, are continued onwards, to be inserted into the base of the third. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the fascia and the annular ligament. By its posterior surface, with the fibula, interosseous membrane, ankle-joint, and Extensor brevis digitorum. By its inner side, with the Tibialis antieus. Extensor proprius poUicis, and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. By its outer side, with the Peroneus longus and brevis. The Peroneus Tertius is a part of the Extensor longus digitorum, and might be described as its fifth tendon. The fibres belonging to this tendon arise from the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the fibula, on its outer side; fi-om the lower part of the interosseous membrane ; and from an intermuscular septum between it and the Peroneus brevis. The tendon, after passing through the same* canal in the annular ligament as the Extensor longus digitorum, is inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, on its inner side. This muscle is sometimes wanting. Nerves. These muscles are supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. Actions. The Tibialis antieus and Peroneus tertius are the direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg; the former muscle, from the obHquity in the direction of its tendon, raises the inner border of the foot; and the latter, acting with the Peroneus brevis and longus, will draw the outer border of the foot upwards, and the sole outwards. The Extensor longus digitorum and Extensor proprius poUicis extend the phalanges of the toes, and, continuing their action, flex the tai-sus upon the leg. Taking their fixed point from below, in the erect posture, all these muscles serve to fix the bones of the leg in the perpendicular position, and give increased strength to the ankle-joint.POSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION.

Make a vertical incision along the middle line of the back of the leg, from the lower m(vt of the popliteal space to the heel, connectino; it below by a transverse incision extending between the two malleoli j tlie flaps of integument being removed, the fascia and muscles should be examined. The muscles in this region of the log are subdivided into two layers, superficial and deep. The superficial layer constitutes a powerful muscular mass, forming the calf of the leg. Their large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular apparatus in man, and bears a direct connection with his or- dinary attitude and mode of progression. Superficial Layer. Gastrocnemius. Soleus. Plantaris. 19; -Muscles of the Back of the Leg. Superficial Layer. ' To-iirlom uf . RUUUUfi LDNCUS » ■HIVIC The Gastrocnemius is the most super- ficial muscle, and forms the greater part of the calf. It arises by two heads, which are connected to the condyles of the femur by two strong flat tendons. The inner head, the larger, and a little the more posterior, arises from a depression at the upper and back part of the inner condyle. The outer head arises from the upper and back part of the external condyle, immediately above the origin of the Pop- liteus. Both heads, also, arise by a few tendinous and fleshy fibres from the ridges which are continued upwards from the condyles to the linea aspera. Bach tendon spreads out into an aponeurosis, which covers the posterior surface of that por- tion of the muscle to which it belongs ; that covering the inner head being longer and thicker than the outer. From the anterior surface of these tendinous ex- pansions, muscular fibres are given ofi*. The fibres in the median line, which cor- respond to the accessory portions of the muscle derived from the bifurcations of the linea aspera, unite at an angle upon a median tendinous raphe below; the remaining fibres converge to the posterior surface of an aponeurosis which covers the front of the muscle, and this, gradu- ally contracting, unites with the tendon of the Soleus, and forms with it the Tendo Achillis. lielations.

By its deep surface, with the posterior ligament of the kuee-joint, the Poplitcus, Soleus, Plantaris, poplitealMUSCLES AND FASCIAE. vessels, and internal popliteal nerve. The tendon of the inner head corresponds with tlie back part of tlio inner condyle, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, which, in some cases, communicates with the cavity of the knee-joint. The tendon of the outer head contains a sesamoid hbro-cartilage (rarely osseous), where it plays over the corresponding outer condyle ; and one m occasionally found in the tendon of the inner head. The Gastrocnemius should be divided across, just below its ori-jin, and turned downwards, in order to expose the next muscles. The Soleus is a broad flat muscle, situated immediately beneath the preceding. It has received its name from its resemblance in shape to a sole-fish. It arises by tendinous fibres from the back part of the head of the fibula, and from the upper third of the internal surface of its shaft; from the oblique line of the tibia, and from the middle third of its internal border ; some fibres also arise from a tendinous arch placed between the tibial and fibular origins of the muscle, beneath which the posterior tibial vessels and nerve pass. The fibres pass back- wards to an aponeurosis which covers the posterior surface of the muscle, and this, gradually becoming thicker and narrower, joins with the tendon of the Gastro- cnemius, and forms with it the Tendo Achillis. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the Gastrocnemius and Plantaris. By its deep surface, with the Flexor longus digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis, Tibialis posticus, and posterior tibial vessels and nerve, from which it is separated by the transverse intermuscular septum or deep fascia of the leg. The Tendo Achillis^ the common tendon of the Gastrocnemius and Soleus, is the thickest and strongest tendon in the body. It is about six inches in length, and formed by the junction of the aponeurosis of the two preceding muscles. It commences about the middle of the leg, but receives fleshy fibres on its anterior surface, nearly to its lower end. Gradually becoming contracted below, it is inserted into the lower part of the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis, a synovial bursa being interposed between the tendon and the upper pai't of the tuberosity. The tendon spreads out somewhat at its lower end, so that its narrowest part is usually about an inch and a half above its insertion. The tendon is covered by the fascia and the integument, and is separated from the deep muscles and vessels by a considerable interval filled up with areolar and adipose tissue. Along its outer side, but superficial to it, is the external saphenous vein. The Plantaris is an extremely diminutive muscle, placed between the Gastro- cnemius and Soleus, and remarkable for its long and delicate tendon. It arises from the lower part of the outer bifurcation of the Hnea aspera, and from the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. It forms a small fusiform belly, about two inches in length, which terminates in a long slender tendon which crosses obliquely between the two muscles of the calf, and running along the inner border of the Tendo Achillis, is inserted with it into the posterior part of the os calcis. This muscle is occasionally double, and is sometimes wanting. Occasionally, its stendon is lost in the internal annular ligament, or in the fiiscia of the leg. Nerves. These muscles are supplied by the internal popliteal nerve. Actions. The muscles of the calf possess considerable power, and are con- stantly called into use in standing, walking, dancing, and leaping; hence the large size they usually present. In walking, these muscles draw powerfully upon the OS ealcifi, raising the heel, and, with it, the entii'e body, from the ground ; the body being thus supported on the raised foot, the opposite limb (san be carried forwards. . In standing, the Soleus, taking its fixed point from below, steadies the le^ npon the foot, and prevents the body from falling forwards, to which there is a constant tendency from the saperiucumbent weight. The Gastrocnemius, acting from below, serves to flex the femur upon the tibia, assisted by the Popliteus.

Deep Layers. \ConJ4fla, Detach the Soleus from its attachment to the fihula and tihia, and turn it downwards when the deep layer of muscles is exposed, covered by the deep fascia of the leg. The Veep Fascia of the leg is a broad, transverse, intermuscular septum, inter- posed between the superficial and deep muscles in the posterior tibio-fibular re-, gion. On each side it is connected to the margins of the tibia and fibula. Above, ■where it covers the Popliteus, it is thick and dense, and receives an expansion from the tendon of the Semimembranosus ; it is thinner in the middle of the leg ; but below, where it covers the tendons passing behind the malleoli, it is thickened. It is continued onwards in the interval between the ankle and the heel, where ifc covers the vessels, and is blended with the internal annular ligament. This fascia should now he removed, com- mencing from helow opposite the tendons, and detaching it from the muscles in tlie direction of their fibres. The Popliteus is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, which forms part of the floor of the popliteal space, and is covered by a tendinous expansion, derived from tlie Semimembranosus muscle. It arises by a strong flat tendon, about an inch in length, from a deep depression on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, and from the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; and is inserted into the inner two-thirds of the triangular surface above the oblique line on the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia, and into the tendinous expansion covering the sur- face of the muscle. The tendon of the muscle is covered by tha,t of the Biceps and the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint; it grooves the outer surface of the external semilunar cartilage, and is invested by the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the fascia above mentioned, which separates it from the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, popliteal vessels, and internal popliteal nerve. By its deep surface, with the superior tibio-fibular articula- tion, and back of the tibia.314 MUSCLES AND FASUi/K The Flexor Juongus PolUcis is situated on the fibular side of the leg, and is the most superficial and largest of the three next muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the iutornal surface of the shaft of the fibula, with the exception of an inch at its lowest part; from the lower part of the interosseous membrane ; from an intermuscular septum between it and the Peronei, externally; and from the fascia coverin"- the Tibialis posticus. The fibres pass obliquely downwards and backwards and terminate round a tendon which occupies nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muscle. This tendon passes through a groove on the posterior surface of the tibia, external to that for the Tibialis posticus and Flexor lono-us digitorum.; it then passes through another groove on the posterior , extremity of the astralagus, and along a third groove, beneath the lesser process of the OS calcis, into the sole of the foot, where it runs forwards between the two heads of the Flexo'r brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the base of the last x^halanx of the 'o-reat toe. The grooves in the astralagus and os calcis which contain the tendon of the muscle, are converted by tendinous fibres into distinct canals, lined by synovial membrane'; and as the tendon crosses the sole of the foot, it is connected to the common flexor by a tendinous slip.

By its inner border, with the Tibiahs posticus, and Flexor longus digitorum. The Flexor Longus Digitorum (perforans) is situated on the tibial side of the leo- At its origin, it is thin and pointed, but gradually increases in size as it descends It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia imme- diately below the oblique line, to within three inches of its extremity, mternal to the tibial origin of the Tibialis posticus; some fibres also aiise from the inter- muscular septum between it and the Tibialis posticus. The fibres termmate m a tendon, which runs nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muse e. This tendon passes, behind the malleolus, in a groove, common to it and the Tibialis posticus, but separated from the latter by a fibrous septum; each tendon bein- contained in a special sheath lined by a separate synovial membrane It then passes obliquely forwards and outwards, beneath the arch of the os calcis, into the sole of the foot (fig. 195), where, crossing beneath the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis, to which it is connected by a strong tendmous_ slip it becomes expanded, is joined by the Flexor accessorius, and finally divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the bases of the last phalanges of the four lesser toes each tendon passing through a fissure in the tendon of the Flexor brevis digitorum, opposite the middle of the first phalanges. Belations. In the leg: by its superficial surface, with the Soleus, and the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, from which it is separated by the deep fascia; by its deep surface, with the tibia and TibiaUs posticus. In the foot, it is covered by the Abductor Pollicis, and Flexor brevis digitorum, and crosses beneath the Flexor longus pollicis. j ■ ^.^ j- The Tildalis Posticus lies between the two preceding muscles, and is the most deeply seated of all the muscles in the leg. It commences above by two pointed p cesses, separated by an angular interval, though which ^^^^^^^ ^f^^ vessels pass forwards to the front of the leg. It arises from the whole of the postex'or surface of the interosseous membrane, excepting its lowest part from L postetlr surface of the shaft of the tibia, external to the Flexor longus digitorum, between the. commencement of the oblique line above, and the middle oi^ he external border of the bone below, and fi-om the upper two-thirds of the ler sulce of the shaft of the fibula; some fibres also arise from the deep fascia, Td 10" th intermuscular septa, separating it from the adjacent muscles 011 e^h Xde This muscle, in the lower fourth of the leg. passes in front of the h le.ac Wus digitorum, terminates in a tendon, which passes through a guoove behind IreTnne malleolus, with the tendon of that muscle, but enclosed m a separateFIBULAR REGION. 3'5 sheath • it then passes through another sheath, over tho internal lateral ligament, and beneath the calcaneo-scaphoid articulation, and is inserted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid, and internal cuneiform bones.

The Popliteus is supplied by the internal popUteal nerve, the remaining muscles of this group by the posterior tibial nerve. Actions. The Popliteus assists in flexing the leg upon the thigh; when the leg is flexed, it will rotate the tibia inwards. The Tibialis posticus is a direct extensor of the tarsus upon the leg ; acting in conjunction with the Tibialis anticus, it turns the sole of the foot inwards, antagonising the Peroneus longus, which turns it outwards. The Flexor fongus digitorum and Flexor longus pollicis are the dii-ect Flexors of the phalanges, and, continuing their action, extend the foot upon the leg; they assist the Gastrocnemius and Soleus in extending the foot, as in the act of walking, or in standing on tiptoe. In consequence of the oblique • direction of the tendon of the long extensor, the toes would be drawn inwards, were it not for the Flexor accessorius muscle, which is inserted into the outer side of that tendon, and draws it to the middle line of the foot during its action. Taking their fixed point from the foot, these muscles serve to maintain the upright posture, by steadying the tibia and fibula, perpendicularly, upon the ankle-joint. They also serve to raise these bones from the oblique position they assume in the stooping posture. Fibular Region. Peroneus Longus. Peroneus Brevis. Dissection. These muscles are readily exposed, by removing' the fascia coverino- their surface, from below upwards, in the line of direction of their fibres. ° The Peroneus Longus is situated at the upper part of the outer side of the leg, and is the more superficial of the two muscles. It arises from the head, and upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula, from the deep surface of the fascia, and from the intermuscular septa,-between it and the muscles on the front, and those on the back of the leg. It terminates in a long tendon, which passes behind the outer malleolus, in a groove, common to it and the Peroneus brevis, the groove being converted into a canal by a fibrous band, and the tendons in- vested by a common synovial membrane ; it is then reflected, obHquely forwards across the outer side of the os calcis, being contained in a separate fibrous sheath' hned by a prolongation of the synovial membrane from that which lines the groove behind the malleolus. Having reached the outer side of the cuboid bone, it runs m a groove on the under surface of that bone, which is converted into a canal by the long calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and is lined by a synovial membrane- the tendon then crosses obliquely the sole of the foot, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe.

The iibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a tendon, which runs in front of that of the precsding muscle through the same o-roove, behind the external malleolus, being contained in the same fabrons sheath and lubricated by the same synovial membrane ; it then passis through a , separ'ite sheath on the outer side of the os calcis, above that for the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and is finally inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, on its outer side. ^ .t. . • Belaiioris.

Actions The Peroneus longus and brevis extend the foot upon the leg, in con- iunction with the Tibialis posticus, antagonising the Tibialis anticus and Peroneus tertius which are flexors of the foot. The Peroneus longus also everts the sole of the foot: hence the extreme eversion occasionally observed m fracture ot the lower end of the fibula, where that bone offers do resistance to the action ot this muscle Taking their fixed point below, the Peronei serve to steady the leg upon the foot This is especially the case in standing upon one leg, when the tendency of the superincumbent weight is to throw the leg inwards : the Peroneus longus overcomes this tendency, by drawing on the outer side of the leg, and thus main- tains the perpendicular direction of the limb. ^urmcal Anatomy.

The honzontal portion xs attached externally to the upper surface of the os calcis, in front of the depress on for the interosseous ligament, and internally to the inner naalleolus and plantar fascia : it contains thi ee sheaths ; the most internal for the tendon of the libia .s anticus, the next in order for the tendon of the Extensor proprius polhcis and the most external for the Extensor longus digitorum and Peroneus tertius: the anterior tibial vessels and nerve lie altogether beneath it. These sheaths are lined by separate synovial membranes. The Internal Ammlar Ligament is a strong fibrous band, which extends from the inner malleolus above, to the internal margin of the os calcis below, converting a series of bony grooves in this situation into osseo-fibrous canals, for the passage of the tendons of the Flexor muscles and vessels into the sole of the foot. It is con- tinuous above with the deep fascia of the leg, below with the plantar fascia and the fibres of origin of the Abductor pollicis muscle. The three canals which it forms, transmit from within outwards, first-, the tendon of the Tibialis posticus; second, the tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum, then the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, which run through a broad space beneath the ligament ; lastly, in a canal formed partly by the astragalus, the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis. Each of these canals is lined by a separate synovial membrane. The External Anmdar Ligament extends from the extremity of the outer malleo- lus to the outer surface of the os calcis: it binds down the tendons of the Peronei muscles in their passage beneath the outer angle. The two tendons are 6nclosed in one synovial sac. Dissection of the Sole of the Foot. The foot should be placed on a high block with the sole uppermost, and firmly secured in that position. Carry an incision round the heel and along the inner and outer borders of the foot to the great and little toes. This incision should divide the integument and thick layer of granular fat beneath, until the fascia is visible; the skin and fat should then be removed from the fascia in a direction from behind forwards, as seen in fig. 189. The Plantar Fascia, the densest of all the fibrous membranes, is of great strength, and consists of dense pearly-white glistening fibres, disposed, for the most part, longitudinally : it is divided into a central and two lateral portions. The central portion, the thickest, is narrow behind and attached to the inner tubercle of the os calcis, behind the origin of the Flexor brevis digitorum, and becoming broader and thinner in front, divides opposite the middle of the meta- tarsal bones into five processes, one for each of the toes. Each of these processes divides opposite the metatarso-phalangeal articulation into two slips, which embrace the sides of the flexor tendons of the toes, and are inserted into the sides of the metatarsal bones, and into the ttfansverse, metatarsal ligament, thus forming a series of arches through which the tendons of the short and long flexors pass to the toes. The intervals left between the five processes allow the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the Lumbricales muscles to become superficial. At the point of division of the fascia into processes and slips, numerous trans- verse fibres are superadded, which serve to increase the strength of the fascia at this part, by binding the processes together, and connecting them with the inte- gument. The central portion of the plantar fascia is continuous with the lateral. portions at each side, and sends upwards into the foot, at their point of junction two strong vertical intermuscular septa, broader in front than behind, which separate the middle from the external and internal plantar group of muscles- from these again thmner transverse septa are derived, which separate the various layers of muscles m this region. The upper surface of this fascia gives attachment behind to the J< lexer brevis digitorum muscle. The lateral portions of the plantar fascia are thinner than the central piece and cover the sides of the foot.3i8 MUSCLES AND FASCI^ffl. The onloTforUon covers the nndor surface of the Abductor minimi digiti; it is thick behind, thin \n front, and extends from the os calcis forwards to the base of the fifth metatarsal bono, into the outer side of wliich it is attached; it is con- tinnous internally with the middle portion of the plantar fascia, and externally with the dorsal fascia. , , , • ^ • The mner portion is very thin, and covers the Abductor pollicis muscle; it is attached behind to the internal annular ligament, and is continuous around the sido of the foot with the dorsal fascia, and externally with the middle portion of the plantar fascia. Muscles of the Foot. These are found in two regions: i. On the dorsum; 2. On the plantar surface. I. Dorsal Region. Extensor Brevis Digitorum. The Fascia on tlie dorsum of the foot is a thin membranous layer, continuous above with the anterior margin of the annular ligament; it becomes gradually lost opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and on eacb side blends with the latei-al portions of the plantar fascia; it forms a sheath for tlie tendons placed on the dorsum of the foot. On the removal of this fascia, the muscles and tendons of the dorsal region of the foot are exposed. The Extensor Brevis Bigitormn (fig. 191) is a broad thin muscle, which arises from the outer side of the os calcis, in front of the groove for the Peroneus brevis ; from the external caloaneo-astragaloid ligament; and from the horizontal portion of the anterior annular ligament. It passes obliquely across the dorsum of the foot, and terminates in four tendons. The innermost, which is the largest, is inserted into the firstphalanx of the great toe, crossing the Dorsalis pedis artery ; the other three into the outer sides of the long extensor tendons of the second third and fourth toes^ Relations.

It arises by a narrow tendi- nous process, from the inner tubercle of the OS calcis, from the central part of the plantar fascia; and from the in- termuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It passes forwards, and divides into four tendons. Oppo- site the middle of the first phalanges, each tendon presents a longitudinal slit, to allow of the passage of the cor- responding tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum ; the two portions form a groove for the reception of that tendon. The tendon of the short Flexor then re- unites and immediately divides a second time into two processes, which are inserted into the sides of the second phalanges. The mode of division of the tendons of the Flexor brevis digitorum, and their insertion into the phalanges, is analogous to the Flexor sublimis in the hand.

It usually occurs in females, and sel- dom under fifty years of age. At this period of life, the cancellous tissue of the neck of the bone not un- frequently is atrophied, be- coming soft and infiltrated with fatty matter: the com- pact tissue is partially ab- sorbed : hence the bone is more brittle, and more liable to fracture. The chan racteristic marks of this ac- cident are slight shortening of the limb, and eversion of the foot, neither of which symptoms occur, however, in some cases until some time after the injury. The eversion is caused by the combined action of the extern,il rotator muscles, as well as by the Psoas and Iliacus, Pec- tineus, Adductors, and Glutei muscles. The shortening is produced by the action of the Glutei, and by the Rectus femoris in front, and the Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semi- membranosus behind. Fracture of the femur just helow the trochanters (fig. 200) is an accident of not unfrequent occurrence, and is at- tended with great displacement, producing considerable deformity. The upper fragment, the portion chiefly dis- placed, is tilted forwards almost at right angles with the pelvis, by the combined action of the Psoas and Iliacus; and, at the same time, everted and drawn outwards by the external rotator and Glutei muscles, causing a mai-ked prominence at the upper and outer side cf the thigh, and much pain_ from the bruising and laceration of the muscles. The limb is shortened, in consequence of the lower frag- ment being drawn upwards by the Rectus in front, and the Biceps, Semimembranosus, and Semitendinosus behind 5 and, at the same time, everted, and the upper end thrown outwards, the lower inwards, by the Pectineus and Ad- ductor muscles. This fracture may be reduced in two different methods: either by direct relaxation of all the opposing muscles, to effect which the limb should be placed on a double inclined plane ; or by overcoming the contrac- tion of the muscles, by continued extension, which may be efiected by means of the long splint. Oblique fracture of the femur immediately above the con- dyles {hg 201) is a formidable injury, and attended with considerable displacement. On exaniination of the limb, the lower fragment may be felt deep in the popliteal space, being drawn backwards by the Gastrocnemius, Soleusj and i lantans muscles; and upwards by the posterior femoral and Kectus muscles.

Fracture of thn fibula, xoith displace- mmt of the tibia (hg. 204), commonly known as ' Pott's Fracture,' is one of the most frequent injuries of the ankle- joint. The end of the tibia is displaced from the corresponding surface of the astragalus ; the internal lateral ligament is ruptured ; and the inner malleolus projects inwards bcneatli the integu- ment, which is tiglitly stretched over it, and in danger of bursting. The fibula is broken, usually from two to three inches above the ankle, and occa- sionally that portion of the tibia with which it is more directly connected be- low ; the foot is everted by the action of the Peroneus longus, its inner border resting upon the ground, and, at the same time, the heel is drawn up by the muscles of the calf. This injury may be at once reduced by flexing the leg at right angles with the thigh, which relaxes all the opposing muscles, and by making slight extension from the knee and ankle. On the Descriptive Anatomy of the Muscles, refer to Cruveilhier's ' Anatomie Descrip- tive ;' 'Traitede Myologie et d'Angeiologie,'by F. G. Theile, Encyclopedie Anatomique, Paris, 1843 ; and Henle's ' liandbuch der Systematischen Anatomic,' before referred to.Of the Arteries. HMiE Arteries are cylindrical tubular vessels, wliicli serve to convey blood from J[ both ventricles of the heart to every part of the body. These vessels were named arteries (co'/p, aw; niptTv, to contain), irom the belief entertained by the ancients that they contained air. To Galen is duo the honour of refuting this opinion ; he showed that these vessels, though for the most part empty after death, contain blood in the living body. The pulmonary artery, which arises from the right ventricle of the heart, carries venous blood directly into the lungs, whence it is returned by the pulmonary veins into the left auricle. This constitutes the lesser or pulmonic circulation. The great artery which arises from the left ventricle, the aorta, conveys arterial blood to the body generally; whence it is brought back to the right side of the heart by means of the veins. This constitutes the greater or systemic circulation. The distribution of the systemic arteries is like a highly ramified tree, the common trunk of which, formed by the aorta, commences at the left ventricle of the heart, the smallest ramifications corresponding to the circumference of the body and the contained organs. The arteries are found in nearly every part of the body, with the exception of the hairs, nails, epidermis, cartilages, and cornea; and the larger trunks usually occupy the most protected situations, running, m the limbs, along the flexor side, where they are less exposed to injury. Thereis considerable variation in the mode of division of the arteries: occasionaUy a short trunk subdivides into several branches at the same point, as we observe in the cosliac and thyroid axes ; or the vessel may give off several branches m suc- cession and still continue as the main trunk, as is seen in the ai'teries of thehmbs ; but the usual division is dichotomous, as, for instance, the aorta dividmg into the two common iliacs ; and the common carotid, into the external and internal. _ The branches of arteries arise at very variable angles; some, as the superior intercostal arteries from the aorta, arise at an obtuse angle ; others, as the lumbar arteries, at a right angle ; or, as the spermatic, at an acute angle. An ai-tery troin which a branch is given off, is smaller in size, but retains a uniform diameter until a second branch is derived from it. A branch of an artery is smaller than the trunk from which it arises; but if an artery divides into two branches, the com- bined area of the two vessels is, in nearly every instance, somewhat greater than that of the trunk; and the combined area of all the arterial branches greatly exceeds the area of the aorta ; so that the arteries collectively may be regarded as a cone, the apex of which corresponds to the aorta; the base to the capiUary The arteries, in their distribution, communicate freely with one another, forming what is called an anastomoses (cuc't, between; crdfia, mouth), or inosculation; and this communication is very free between the large, as well as between the smaller branches. The anastomoses between trunks of equal size is found where great freedom and activity of the circulation is requisite, as in the bram ; here the two vertebral arteries unite to form the basilar, and the two internal carotid arteries are connected bv a short communicating trunk; it is also found in the abdomen the intestinal arteries having very free anastomoses between their larger bvanehes In the limbs, the anastomoses are most frequent and of largest size tl^ ioints- the branches of an artery above freely inosculating with branches from the ve'ssds below; these anastomoses are of considerable interest to the surgeon.327 TPIE AORTA. as it is by their enlargement that a collateral mdation is established after the application of a ligature to an artery for the cure of aneurism. The smaller branches of arteries anastomose more frequently than the larger; and between the smallest twigs, these inosculations become so numerous as to constitute a close network that pervades nearly every tissue of the body. Throughout the body generally, the larger arterial branches pursue a perfectly straight course; but in certain situations they arc tortuous ; thus, the facial artery in its course over the face, and the arteries of the lips, are extremely tortuous m their course, to accommodate themselves to the movements of the parts. The uterine arteries are also tortuous, to accommodate themselves to^ the increase of size which the organ undergoes during pregnancy. Again, the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, previous to their entering the cavity of the skull, describe a series of curves, which are evidently intended to diminish the velocity of the curre-nt of blood, by increasing the extent of surface over which it moves, and adding to the amount of impediment which is produced by friction. The arteries are dense in structure, of considerable strength, highly elastic, and, when divided, they preserve, although empty, their cylindrical form. The minute structure of these vessels is described in the Introduction. In the description of the arteries, we shall first consider the efferent trunk of the systemic circulation, the aorta, and its branches ; and then the efferent trunk of. tlie pulmonic circulation, the pulmonary artery. The Aorta. The aoHa (aopri] ; arteria magna}! is the main trunk of a series of vessels,, which, arising from the heart, convey the red oxygenated blood to every part of the body for its nutrition. This vessel commences at the upper part of the left ventricle, and after ascending for a short distance, arches backwards to the left side, over the root of the left lung, descends within the thorax on the left side of the vertebral column, passes through the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and entering the abdominal cavity, terminates, considerably diminished in size, oppo- site the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into'the right and left common iliac arteries. Hence its subdivision into the arch of the aorta, the thoracic aorta^ and the abdominal aorta * from the direction €«■ position of its parts. Arch oi' the Aorta. Dissectim. In order to examine the arch of the aorta, open the thorax, by dividing the cartilages of the ribs on each side of the sternum, raising this bone from below upwards, and then sawing through the sternum on a level with its articulation with the clavicle. By this means, the relations of the large vessels to the upper border of the sternum and root of the neck are kept in view. The arch of the aorta extends from the origin of the vessel at the upper part of the left ventricle to the lower border of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra. At its commencement, it ascends behind the' sternum, obliquely upwards and forwards towards the right side, and opposite the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side, passes transversely from right to lef<}, and from before backwards, to the left side of the third dorsal vertebra ; it then descends upon the left side of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra, at the lower border of which it takes the name of thoracic aorta. The arch of the aorta describes a, curve, the convexity of which is directed upwards and to the right side ; and it is subdivided, at the points where it changes its direction, so as to be described in three portions, the ascending, transverse, and descending portions of the arch of the aorta. ^ aMLT?ro,?^!^!wf ^^''^^^ transverse aorta, dorsal aorta, an,l versaTuse.

A section of the aorta opposite this part has a somewhat triangular figure ; but below the attachment ot the valves it is circular. This portion of the heart is contained in the cavity of the pericardium, and, together with the pulraonaiy artery, is invested in a tube ot serous membrane, continued on to them from the surface of the heart.ARCH OF AORTA. 329 Relations.

Less frequently, the aorta, after archiu- over the root of the right lung, is directed to its usual position on the left side of the spine^this peculiarity not being accompanied by any transposition of the viscera. In Conformation. The aorta occasionally divides, as in some quadrupeds, into an ascending and a descending trunk, the former of which is directed vertically upwards, and subdivides into three branches, to supply the head and upper extremities. Sometimes the aorta sub- divides soon after its origin into two branches, which soon reunite. In one of these pases, the cEsophagus and trachea were found to pass through the interval left by their division; this is the normal condition of the vessel in the reptilia. Sttrgical Anatomy. Of all the vessels of the arterial system, the aorta, and more especially its arch, is most frequently the seat of disease ; hence it is important to consider some of the consequences that may ensue from aneurism of this part. _ . It will bo remembered, that the ascending pai't of the arch is contained in the pericardium, just behind the sternum, being crossed at its commencement by the pulmonary artery and right auricular appendix, and having the root of the right lung behind, the vena cava on the right side, and the pulmonary artery and left auricle on the left side. Aneurism of the ascending aorta, in tlie situation of the aortic sinuses, in the great majority of cases, affects the right coronary sinus ; this is mainly owing to the fact that the regurgitation of blood upon the sinuses takes place chiefly on the right anterior aspect of the vessel. As the anenrismal sac enlarges, it may compress any or all of the structures in immediate proximity with it, but chiefly projects towards the right anterior side; and, consequently, interferes mainly with those structures that have a coiTesponding relation with the vessel. In the majority of cases, it bursts into the cavity of the pericardium, the patient suddenly drops down dead, and, upon a post-mortem examination, the pericardial sac is found full of blood: or it may compress the right auricle, or the pulmonary artery, and adjoining part of the right ventricle, and open into one or the other of these parts, or may press upon the superior cava. Aneurism of the ascending aorta, originating above the sinuses, most frequently impli- cates the right anterior wall of the vessel; this is probably mainly owing to the blood being impelled against this part. The direction of the aneurism is also chieiBy towards the right of the median line. If it attains a large size and projects forwards, it may absorb the sternum and the cartilages of the ribs, usually on the right side, and appear as a pulsating tumour on the front of the chest, just below the manubrium ; or it may burst into the peri- cardium, or may compress, or open into, the right lung, the trachea, broncbi, or oesophagus. Regarding the transverse part of the arch, the student is reminded that the vessel lies on the trachea, the oesophagus, and thoracic duct; that the recurrent laryngeal nerve winds around it; and that from its upper part are given off three large trunks, which or It may ultimately burst into that tube, producing fatal haBmoiThage. Again, its pressure' on the laryngeal nerves may give rise to symptoms which so accurately resemble those of laryngitis, that the operation of tracheotomy has in some cases been resorted to, from the supposition that disease existed in the larynx; or it may press upon the thoracic duct, and destroy life by mamtion; or it may involve the oesophagus, producing dysphagia; or may burst into the oesophagus, when fatal hfemorrhage will occur. Again, the innominate, artery, or the left carotid, or subclavian, may be so obstructed by clots, as to produce a weakness, or even a disappearance, of the pulse in one or the other wrists; or the tumour f .1 f °ianubrium, generally either in the median line, or to neck! sternum, and may simulate an aneurism of one of the arteries of the thetft"jjl?.n,'S'""^/^' descending part of the arch is usually directed backwards and to" ?nnn .'

J3ut the number may be increased to lour, rom the light carotid and subclavian arteries ari«ng directly from the aorta the innominate being absent. In most of these latter cases, the right sube avian has been found to arise Irom the left end of the arch • in other cases, it was the second or third branch given oti instead ot the lirst Lastly the number of trunks from the arch may bo increaaed to five or six; m these instances, tlio external and internal carotids arose separately from the arch, the common carotid being absent on one or both sides. . • v,, ^-a „ Number nsnal, Arrmujemcnt different. When the aorta arches over to the right side, the three branches have an arrangement the reverse of what is usual, the innominate supplying the left side • and the carotid and subclavian (which arises separately) the right side. In other cases where the aorta takes its usual course, the two carotids may be joined in a common trunk, and the subclavians arise separately from the arch, the right subclavian eenerallv arising from the left end of the arch. , , . Secondary Branches sometimes arise from the arch ; most commonly such a secondary branch is the left vertebral, which usually takes origin between the left carotid and lelt subclavian, or beyond them. Sometimes, a thyroid branch is derived from the arch, or the rio'ht internal mammary, or left vertebral, or, more rarely, both vertebrals. The Coeonart Autekies. The coronary arteries supply the heart; they are two in number, right and left, arising near the commencement of the aorta immediately above the free margm of the semilunar valves, . The Bight Coronary Artery, about the size of a crow's quill, arises from the aorta immediately above the free margin of the right semilunar valve, between the pulmonary artery and the right appendix auriculsB. It passes forwards to the rio-ht side, in the groove between the right auricle and ventricle, and curving around the right border of the heart, runs along its posterior surface as far as the posterior interventricular groove, where it divides into two branches, one ot which continues onwards in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle,^ and anastomoses with the left coronary ; the other descends along the posterior inter- ventricular furrow, supplying branches to both ventricles and to the septum, and anastomosing at the apex of the heart with the descendmg branch of the lett ''"''Thk vessel sends a large branch along the thin margin of the right ventricle to the apex, and numerous small branches to the right auricle and ventricle, and the commencement of the pulmonary artery. _ t,, , ft... The Left Ooronary, smaller than the former, arises immediately above the tree ed^e of the left semilunar valve, a little higher than the right; it passes forwards between the pulmonary artery and the left appendix auricute, ^d descends obliquely towards the anterior interventricular groove, where it divides mto two branches Of these, one passes transversely outwards in the left auriculo-ventn- cular .roove, and winds around the left border of the heart to its posterior surface, wto it anastomoses with the superior branch of the right coronary ; he other descends along the anterior interventricular groove to the apex of the hear^ there it anastLoses with the descending branch of the right coronary.

In front, it is separated from the first bono of the sternum by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the remains of tho thymus gland, and the left innominate and right inferior thyroid veins which cross its root. BeJnnd, it lies upon the trachea, which it crosses obliquely. On the right side, is the right vena innominata, right pneumogastric nerve, and the pleura ; and on the left side, the remains of the thymus gland, and origin of the left carotid artery.

When the bifurcation of the innominate artery varies from the point above mentioned, it sometimes ascends a considerable distance above the sternal end of the clavicle; les.s frequently it divides below it. In the former class of cases, its length may exceed two inches; and, in the latter, be reduced to au inch or less. These are points of considerable interest for the surgeon to remember in connection with the opera- tion of tying this vessel. Branches. The arteria innominatfi occasionally supplies a thyroid branch (middle thyroid artery), which ascends along the front of the trachea to the thyroid gland ; and sometimes, a thymic pr bronchial branch. The left carotid is frequently joined with the innominate artery at its origin. Sometimes, there is no innominate artery, the right subclavian arising directly from the arch of the aorta. ^ Positio^i. When the aorta arches over to the right side, the innominate is directed to the left side of the neck instead of the right. Collateral circidation. Allan Burns demonstrated, on the dead subject, the possibility of the establishment of the collateral circulation after ligature of the innominate artery, by tying and dividing that artery, after which, he says, ' Even coarse injection impelled into the aorta, passed freely by the anastomosing branches into the arteries of the rio-ht arm, tilling them and all the vessels of the head completely.' (Surc/ical Anatomy of the Head and Neck, p. 62). Ihe branches by which this circulation vrould be carried on are very numerous; thus, all the communications across the middle line between the branches of the carotid arteries of opposite sides would be available for the supply of blood to the right side of the head and neck; while the anastomosis between the superior intercostal of the subclavian and the farst aortic intercostal (see infra on the collateral circulation after obliteration of the thoracic aorta), would bring the blood, by a free and direct course, into the right subclavian: the numerous connections also, between the lower intercostal arteries, and the branches ot the axillary and internal mammary arteries would, doubtless, assist in the supply of blood l^nl'^^S fr-T 1 epigastric, from the external iliac, would by means ot" its anasto- 3 of the chest "i™^7, compensate for any deficiency in the vascularity of the Surpical Anatomj/.

'Ian of a SruTtcJies ofUe (lERNAL CAHOTJO At the lower part of the neck the two common carotid arteries are separated from each other by a very small interval, which contains the trachea; but at the upper part, the thyroid body, the larynx and pharynx project forwards between the two vessels, and give the appearance of their being placed further back in that situation. The common carotid artery is contained in a sheath, derived from the deep cervical fascia, which also encloses the internal jugular vein and pneumo- gastnc nerve, the vein lying on the outer side of the artery, and the nervo between336 ARTERIES. the arfcory and vein, on a plane posterior to both.

At the lower part of the neck the common carotid artery is very deeply seated, being covered by the superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia, the Sterno-mastoid, Sfcerno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid muscles, and by the Omo-hyoid opposite the cricoid cartilage; but in the upper part of its course, near its ter- mination it is more superficial, being covered merely by the integument, the superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia, and inner margin of the Sterno- mastoid and is contained in a triangular space, bounded behind by the Sterno- mastoid' above by the posterior belly of the Digastric, and below by the anterior belly of'the Omo-hyoid. This part of the artery is crossed obliquely from within outwards by the sterno-mastoid artery; it is crossed also by the facial, lingual, and superior thyroid veins, which terminate in the internal jugular, and descend- ance on its sheath in front, is seen the descendens noni nerve, this filament being joined with branches from the cervical nerves, which cross the vessel from without inwards. Sometimes the descendens noni is contained within the sheath. The middle thyroid vein crosses the artery about its middle, and the anterior jugular vein below. Behind, the artery lies in front of the cervical portion of the spine, restino- first on the Longus colli muscle, then on the Rectus anticus major, from which°it is separated by the sympathetic nerve. The recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior thyroid artery cross behind the vessel at its lower part. InternaUy, it is in relation with the trachea and thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve being interposed; higher up, with the larynx and pharynx. On its outer side are placed the internal jugular vein and pneumo- At the lower part of the neck, the internal jugular vein on the right side diverges from the artery, but on the left side it approaches it, and often crosses its lower part. This is an important fact to bear in mind during the performance of any operation on the lower part of the left common carotid artery. Plan of the Relations of the Common Carotid Aeteey. In Front.

In such cases the whole of the artery 1? aieS and any part may be tied, except close to either end. When the case is such ^ 0 allow of a choici being mfade, the 'lower^art of the carotid should never be .selected ^ the spot upon which to place a ligature, for not only is the artery in this situation Dlaced very deeply in the neck, but it is covered by three layers of muscles, and on the left side the iagular vein, in the great majority of cases, passes obliquely m front of it. Neither should the upper end be selected, for here the superior thyroid, lingual, and tacial yeins would "-ive rise to very considerable difficulty in the application of a ligature. I he point most favourable for the operation is opposite the lower part of the larynx, and here a ligature may be applied on the vessel, either above or below the point where it is crossed by the Omo-hyoid muscle. In the former situation the artery is most accessible, and it may be tied there in cases of wounds, or aneurism of any of the large branches of the carotid; whilst in cases of aneurism of the upper part of the carotid, that part of the vessel may be selected which is below the Omo-hyoid. It occasionally happens that the carotid artery bifurcates below its usual position: if the artery be exposed at its point of bifurcation, both divisions of the vessel should be tied near their origin, m preference to tyino' the trunk of the artery near its termination; and if, in consequence of the entire absence of the common carotid, or from its early division, two arteries, the external and internal carotids, are met with, the ligature should'be placed on that vessel which is found' on compression to be connected with the disease. In this operation, the direction of the vessel and the inner margin of the Sterno-mastoid, are the chief guides to its performance. To tie the Common Carotid, above the Omo-hyoid. The patient should fee placed on his back with the head thrown back : an incision is to be made, three inches long, in the direction of the anterior border of the Sterno-niastqid, from a little below the angle of the jaw to a level with the cricoid cartilage: after dividing the integument, superficial fascia, and Platysma, the deep fascia must be cut through on a director, so as to avoid wounding numerous small veins that are usually found beneath. The head may now be brought forwards so as to relax the parts somewhat, and the margins of the wound held asunder by copper spatulse. The descendens noni nerve is now exposed, and must be avoided, and the sheath of the vessel having been raised by forceps, is to be opened over the artery to a small extent at its inner side. The internal jugular vein may now present itself alternatelj' distended and relaxed; this should be compressed both above and below, and drawn outwards, in order to facilitate the operation. The aneurism needle is now passed from the outside, care being taken to keep the needle in close contact with the artery, and thus avoid the risk of injuring the jugular vein, or including the vagus nerve. Before the ligature is tied, it should be ascertained that nothing but the artery is in- cluded in it. To tie the Common Carotid below tfie Omo-hyoid. The patient should be placed in the same position as above-mentioned. An incision about three inches in length is to be made, parallel with the inner edge of the Sterno-mastoid, commencing on a level with the cricoid cartilage. The inner border of the Sterno-mastoid having been exposed, the sterno-mastoid artery and a large vein, the middle thyroid, will be seen, and must be carefully avoided ; the Sterno-mastoid is to be drawn outwards, and the Sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles inwards. The deep fascia must now be divided below the Omo-hyoid muscle, and the sheath having been exposed, must be opened, care being takun to avoid the descendens noni, which here runs on the inner or tracheal side. The jugular vein and vagus nerve being then pressed to the outer side, the needle must be passed round the artery fi-om without inwards, great core Z338 AH'rKlilKS. being taken to avoid Ike inferior thyroid artery, the recurrent laryngeal, and sympathetic uervea which lie behind it. „ , , n- 7 /• Aftpr lisrature of the common carotid, the collateral circulation C\mJ«^. *.

The external carotid artery gives off eight branches, which, for con- venience of description, may be divided into four sets. (See fig. 208, Plan ot the Branches.) Anterior. Posterior. Ascending. Terminal. Superior Thyroid. Occipital. Ascending Pha- Temporal. Lino-ual. Posterior Auricular. ryngeal. Internal Maxillary. Facial. The student is here reminded that many variations are met with in the number, origin, and course of these branches in different subjects ; but the above arrange- ment is that which is found in the great majority of cases. The SoPEEiOR Thyroid Artery (figs. 207 and 212), is the first branch given off from the external carotid, being derived from that vessel just below the great cornu of the hyoid bone. At its commencement, it is quite superficial, being covered by the integument, fascia, and Platysma, and is contained in the trian- gular space bounded by the Sterno-mastoid, Digastric, and Omo-hyoid muscles. After running upwards and inwards for a short distance, it curves downwards and forwards, in an arched and tortuous manner, to the upper part of the thyroid gland, passing beneath the Omo-hyoid, Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid muscles; and distributes numerous branches to the anterior surface of the gland, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. Besides the arteries distributed to the muscles and the substance of the gland, the branches of the superior thyroid are the following : Hyoid. Superior Laryngeal. Superficial descending branch (Sterno-mastoid). Orico-Thyroid. The Injmd is a small branch which runs along the lower border of the os hyoides, beneath the thyro-hyoid muscle; after supplying the muscles connected to that bone, it forms an arch, by anastomosing with the vessel of the opposite side. The superficial descending hranch runs downwards and outwards across the sheath of the common carotid artery, and supplies the Sterno-mastoid and neigh- bouring muscles and integument. It is of importance that the situation of this vessel be remembered, in the operation for tying the common carotid artery. There is often a distinct branch from the external carotid distributed to the Sterno- mastoid muscle. The superior laryngeal, larger than either of the preceding, accompanies the superior laryngeal nerve, beneath the Thyro-hyoid muscle; it pierces the thyro- hyoid membrane, and supplies the muscles, mucous membrane, and glands of the larynx and epiglottis, anastomosing with the branch from the opposite side. The crico-thyroid (inferior laryngeal) is a small branch which runs transversely across the crico-thyroid membrane, communicating with the artery of the opposite side. The position of this vessel should be remembered, as it may prove the source of troublesome ha3morrhage during the operation of laryngotomy. z 2340 AR'I'KIUES. Surqicnl Anatomy. The superior tliyroid, or some of ita branches, are often divided in cases of cut throat, giving rise to considoniblo liu'.uiorrliago. In sucii cases, the artery should be secured, tlio wt)uiid being enlarged lor tluit jjurposo, if necessary. Tiie operation nuiy be easily performed, the position of tlie artery being very superlicial, and the only structures of importance covering it being a few small veins. The operation of tying the superior thyroid artery in bronchocele, has been perlbrmed in numerous instances with partial or temporary success. When however, the collateral circulation between tiiis vessel and the artery of the opposite side, and the inferior thyroid, is completely re-established, the tumour usually regains its former size. Tlio Lingual Aktiory (fig. 212) arises from the external cai'otid between tlic saporiov tliyroid and facial; it runs obliquely upwards and inwards t(j the great cornu of the liyoid bone, tliou passes liorizontally forwards parallel with the great cornu, and, ascending pei-pondicularly to the under surface of the tangue, turns forwards on its under surface as far as the tip of that organ, under the name of the ranine -artery. llelations. Its first, or oblique portion, is superficial, being contained in the triangular space already described, resting upon the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and covered by the Platysma and fascia of the neck. Its second, or horizontal portion, also lies upon the Middle constrictor, being covered at first by the tendon of the digastric and the Stylo-hyoid muscle, and afterwards by the Hyo-glossus, the latter muscle separating it from the hypoglossal nerve. Its third, or ascending portion, lies between the Hyo-glossus and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles. The fourth, or terminal part, under the name of the ranine, runs along the und-er surface of the tongue to its tip: it is very superficial, being covered only by the mucous membrane, and rests on the Lingualis on the outer side of the Genio-hyo-glossus.. The hypoglossal nerve lies nearly parallel with the lingual artery, separated from it, in the second part of its course, by the Hyo- glossus muscle. The branches of the lingual artery are, the Hyoid. Sublingual. Dorsalis Linguae. Ranine. The hyoid iTanoh runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone, supplying the muscles attached to it and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The dorsalis Unrjum (fig. 212) arises from the Ungual artery beneath the Hyo- glossus muscle (which, in the figure, has been partly cut away, to show the vessel); ascending to the dorsum of the tongue, it supplies the mucous membrane, the tonsil, soft palate, and epiglottis ; anastomosing with its fellow from the opposite side. The suUingual, which may be described as a branch of bifurcation of the lingual arteiT, arises at the anterior margin of the Hyo-glossus muscle, and, running forwards and outwards beneath * the Mylohyoid to the sublingual gland, supphes its substance, giving branches to the Mylo-hyoid and neighbouring muscles, the mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. The ranine may be regarded as the other branch of bifurcation, or, as is more usual, as the continuation of the lingual artery; it runs along the under surface of the tongue, resting on the Lingualis, and covered by the mucous membi-ane of the mouth; it lies on the outer side of the Genio-hyo-glossus, and is covered by the Hyo-giossus and Stylo-glossus, accompanied by the gustatory nerve. On arriving ah the tip of the tongue, it anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side. These vessels in the mouth are placed one on each side of the frajnum. Surgical Anatomy. The lingual artery may be divided near its origin in cases of cut throat, a complication that not unfrequently happens in this cla^s of "^'^^fXLuror hfemoirha^'e which cannot be restranied by ordinary means, may ensue from a wouna, or ren ulcer of the tonoue.

In tho nech, its origin is superEcial, being covered by the integument, . Platysma, and fascia ; it then passes beneath the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and tlio submaxillary gland. 0/i tho face, where it passes over the body of tho lower jaw, it is comparatively superficial, lying immediately beneath the Platygma, In this situation, its pulsation may be distinctly felt and compression of the vessel effectually made against the bone. In its course over the face, it is covered by the into'i-umont, tho fat of tho cheek, and, near the angle of the mouth, by the Platysma and°Zygomatic muscles. It rests on the Buccinator, the Levator anguli oris, and the Levator labii superiorls. It is accompanied by the facial vein throughout its entire course ; tho vein is not tortuous like the artery, and, on the face, is separated from that vessel by a considerable interval, lying to its outer side. The branches of tho facial nerve cross the artery, and the infra-orbital nerve lies beneath it. The branches of this vessel may be divided into two sets, those given off below the jaw (cervical), and those on the face (facial) : Cervical Branches. Facial Branches. | Inferior or Ascending Palatine. Muscular. <. Tonsillar. Inferior Labial. I Submaxillary. Inferior Coronary. Submental. Superior Coronary. Lateralis Nasi. Angular. The inferior ov ascending palatine (fig. 212) passes up between the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus to the outer side of the pharynx. After supplying these muscles the tonsil, and Eustachian tube, it divides, near the Levator palati, into two branches; one follows the course of the Tensor palati, and supplies the soft palate and the palatine glands ; the other passes to the tonsil, which it supplies, anastomosing with the tonsillar artery. These vessels inosculate with the posterior palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery. The tonsillar branch (fig. 212) passes up along the side of the pharynx and, perforating the Superior constrictor, ramifies in the substance of the tonsil and root of the tongue. The submaxillary consist of three or four large branches, which supply the submaxillary gland, some being prolonged to the neighbouring muscles, lymphatic glands, and integument. _ _ ^.i f •„! The suUiental, the largest of the cervical branches, is given off from the fac al arterv i^st as that vessel quits the submaxillary gland ; it runs forwards upon the Mvlo-byoid muscle, just below the body of the jaw, and beneath the Digastric; after sunplyiD"- the muscles attached to the jaw, and anastomosing with the sub- lino-ual artery?it arrives at the symphysis of the chin, where it divides into a superficial and deep branch; the former turns round the chm, and passing between the integument and Depressor labii inferioris, supphes both, and anasto- moses with the inferior labial.

The angular artery is the termination of the trank of the facial; it ascends to the inner angle of the orbit, accompanied by a large vein, the angularit distributes some branches on the cheek which anastomose with the infraorbital, and, after supplying the lachrymal sac, and Orbicularis muscle, terminates by anastomosing with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The anastomoses of the facial artery are very numerous, not only with the vessel of the opposite side, but with other vessels from different sources : viz., with the sublingual branch of the lingual, with the mental branch of the inferior dental as it emerges from the mental foramen, with the ascending pharyngeal and posterior palatine, and with the ophthalmic, a branch of the internal carotid ; it also inoscu- lates with the transverse facial, and with the infraorbital. Feculiarities. The facial artery not unfrequently arises by a common trunk with the lingual. This vessel also is subject to some variations in its size, and in the extent to whieh it supplies the face. It occasionally terminates as the submental, and not unfrequently supplies the face only as high as the angle of the mouth or nose. The deficiency is then supplied by enlarge- ment of one of the neighboming arteries. Surgical Anatomy. The passage of the facial artery over the body of the jaw would appear to afford a favourable position for the application of pressure in cases (si haemorrhage from the lips, the result either of an accidental wound, or from an operation; but its application is useless, except for a very short time, on account of the free communication of this vessel with its fellow, and with numerous branches from diiferent sources. In a wound involving the lip, it is better to seize the part between the fingers, and evert it, when the bleeding vessel may be at once secured with a tenaculum. In order to prevent hsemorrhage in cases of excision, or in the removal of diseased growths from the part, the hp should be compressed on each side between the finger and thumb, whilst the surgeon excises the diseased part. In order to stop haemorrhage where the lip has been divided in an operation, it is necessary in uniting the edges of the wound, to pass the sutures through the cut edges, almost as deep as its mucous surface; by these means, not only are the cut surfaces more neatly and securely adapted to each other, but the possibility of haemorrhage is prevented by including in the suture the divided artery. If the suture is, on the con- trary, passed through merely the cutaneous portion of the wound, hsemorrhage occurs into ' the cavity of the mouth. The student should, lastly, observe the relation of the angular artery to the lachrymal sac, and it will be seen that, as the vessel passes up along the inner margin of the orbit, it ascends on its nasal side. In operating for fistula lachryma- lis, the sac should always be opened on its outer side, in order that this vessel may be avoided. The Occipital Artery (fig. 209) arises from the posterior part of the external carotid, opposite the facial, near the lower margin of the Digastric muscle. At its origin, it is covered by the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and part of the parotid gland, the hypoglossal nerve winding around it from be- hind forwards ; higher up, it passes across the internal cai-otid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves ; it then ascends to the interval between the transverse process of the atlas, and the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and passes horizontally backwards, grooving the surface of the latter bone, being covered by the Sterno-mastoid, Splenius, Digastric, and344 ARTERIES.

Tho. branches given oil" from this vessel are, Muscular. Meningeal. Auricular. Arteria Princeps Ccrvicis. Tho muscular hranches supply the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, Sterno-mastoid, Splenius, and Trachelo-raastoid muscles. Tho branch distributed to tho Stcrno- mastoid is of large size. The auricular branch supplies the back part of the concha. The meningeal branch ascends with the internal jugular vein, and enters the skull through the foramen lacerum posterius, to supply the dura mater in the posterior fossa. , . , , The arteria princeps cervicis (fig. 212) is a large branch which descends along the back part of the neck, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The former runs beneath the Splenius, giving off branches which perforate that muscle to supply the Trapezius, anastomosing with the Superficial cervical artery: the latter passes beneath the Complexus, between it and the SemispinaUs colli, and ■ anastomoses with the vertebral and deep cervical branch of the superior inter- costal. The anastomosis between these vessels serves mainly to establish the collateral circulation after ligature of the carotid or subclavian artery. The cranial branches of the occipital artery are distributed upon the occiput; they are very tortuous, and lie between the integument and Occipito-frontalis anastomosing with the artery of the opposite side, the posterior auricular, and temporal arteries. They supply the back part of the Occipito-frontalis muscle, the integument and pericranium, and one or two branches occasionally pass through the parietal or mastoid foramina, to supply the dura mater. The Posterior Auricular Artery (fig. 209) is a small vessel which arises trom the external carotid, above the Digastric and Stylo-byoid muscles, opposite the apex of the styloid process. It ascends, under cover of the parotid gland to the groove between the cartilage of the ear and the mastoid process, immediately above which it divides into two branches, an anterior, passing forwards to_ anastomose with the posterior division of the temporal; and a posterior, communicating with the occipital. Just before arriving at the mastoid process, this artery is crossed by the portio dura, and has beneath it the spinal accessory nerve. Besides several small branches to the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid muscles, and to the parotid gland, this vessel gives off two branches: Stylo-Mastoid. Auricular. The stylo-mastoid branch enters the stylo-mastoid foramen, and supplies the tym- panum, mastoid cells, and semicii'cular canals. In the young subject a branch from this vessel forms, with the tympanic branch from the internal maxdlary, a vascular ch-cle, which surrounds the auditory meatus, and from which delicate vessels ramify on the membrana tympani. .-i ^ flir. The auricular branch is distributed to ihe back part of the cartilage ot le ear upon which it ramifies minutely, some branches curving round the margin of the fibro-cartilage, others perforating it, to supply its anterior surface. The ASCENDING Pharyngeal Artery (fig. 2x2), the smallest branch o tlie ex- ternal carotid, is a long slender vessel, deeply seated in the ^^^^^,f ^^^^^^^ branches of tho external carotid and the Stylo-pharyngeus muscle.

One the posterior meningeal, enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum postenus with the internal jugular vein. A second passes through the foramen lacerum medium and occasionally a third through the anterior condyloid foramen. They are all distributed to the dura mater. The Temporal Arteey (fig. 209), the smaller of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of that vessel. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, in the interspace between the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw and the external meatus, crosses over the root of the zygoma, immediately beneath the integument, and divides about two inches above the zygomatic arch into two branches, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior temporal inclines forwards over the forehead, supplying the muscles, inteo-ument, and pericranium in this region, and anastomoses with the supraorbital and frontal arteries, its branches being directed from before backwards. The posterior tem;po^'al, larger than the anterior, curves upwards and back- wards along the side of the head, lying above the temporal fascia, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. The temporal artery, as it crosses the zygoma, is covered by the Attrahens aurem muscle, and by a dense fascia given off from the parotid gland ; it is also usually crossed by one or two veins, and accompanied by branches of the facial and auriculo- temporal nerves. Besides some twigs to the parotid gland, the articulation of the jaw, and the Masseter muscle, its branches are the Transverse Facial. Middle Temporal. Anterior Auricular. The transverse facial is given off from the temporal before that vessel quits the parotid gland ; running forwards through its substance, it passes transversely across the face, between Steno's duct and the lower border of the zygoma, and divides on the side of the face into numerous branches, which supply the parotid gland, the Masseter muscle, and the integument, anastomosing with the facial and infraorbital arteries. This vessel rests on the Masseter, and is accompanied by one or two branches of the facial nerve. It is sometimes a branch of the external carotid. The middle temporal artery arises immediately above the zygomatic arch, and perforating the-temporal fascia, suppHes the Temporal muscle, anastomosing with the deep temporal branches of the internal maxillaiy. It occasionally gives off an orbital branch, which runs along the upper border of the zygoma, between the two layers of the temporal fascia, to the outer angle of the orbit. This branch supplies the Orbicularis, palpebrarum, and anastomoses with the lachrymal and palpebral branches of the ophthalmic artery. The anterior auricular hranclies are distributed to the anterior portion of the pinna, the lobule, and part of the external meatus, anastomosing with branches of the posterior auricular.ARTEIiTES. 346 Survival Anatomy.

Under these circunistnnccs, the anterior brunch is tiio one usually selected. If the student will consider the relations of the trunk of this vessel, as it crosses the zygomatic arch, with the surrounding structures, ho will observe that it is covered by a thick and dense fas-cia, crossed by one or two veins, and accompanied by branches of tlio lacial and temporo- nuricular nerves. Bleeding should not bo performed in this situntion, as much diiliciilty may arise from the dense fascia over the vessel preventing a free flow of blood, and consider- able pressure is requisite afterwards to repress the lucmorrhage. Again, a varicose aneurism may be formed by the accidental opening of one of the veins in front of the artery ; or severe neiirahnc pain may arise from the operation implicating one of the nervous filamenta in the neighbourhood. , , , ■ t ^ ]•! The anterior branch is, on the contrary, subcutaneous, is a large vessel, and as readily compressed as any other portion of the artery; it should consequently always be selected for the operation. The Internal Maxillary (fig. 210), the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, passes inwards, at right angles from that vessel, to the inner 210.—The Internal Maxillary Artery, and its Branches.

At its origin, it is imbedded in the substance of the parotid gland, being on a level with the lower extremity of the lobe of the ear. In the first parb of its course (maxillary portion), the artery passes horizontally forwards and inwards, between the ramus of the jaw and the internal lateral lieament The artery here lies parallel with the auriculo-temporal nerve ; it crosses the inferior dental nerve, and lies beneath the narrow portion of the External pterygoid muscle.INTERNAL MAXILLARY. 347 , , It- /.nnrsn ^ntervfoid Tjortion), it runs obliqnely for- lu the Becond part ol Us •''•'^''^ [f'-rl''tL Ext» nal pterygoid m„solo, ■""tiho t,« p.. of ^-rz^trx^^'^^:^^ superior maxillary bone, and enters the spiieno-mci.vniciijr , _ hupbuoi muj^iiicMj- „' . . n „ Wvfo,.n.il ntorvo'cid, where it lies in relation between the processes of origin of the Lxtemdl pcciytum, w with Meckel's ganglion, and gives off its terminal branches.

The branches of this vessel may be divided into three groups, corresponding with its three divisions. Branches fkom the Maxillary Portion. Tympanic (anterior). Small Meningeal. Middle Meningeal. Inferior Dental. The tympanic Irancli passes upwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw, enters the tympanum through the fissure of Glaser, supplies the Laxator tympani, and ramifies upon the membrana tympani, anastomosing with the stylo-mastoid, Vidian, and tympanic branch from the internal carotid. The middle meningeal is tbe largest of the branches which supply the dura mater. It arises from the internal maxillary between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of the jaw, and passes vertically upwards to the foramen spinosnm of the sphenoid bone. On entering the cranium, it divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior branch, the larger, crosses the great ala of the sphenoid, and reaches the groove, or canal, in the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone; it then divides into branches, which spread out between the dura mater and internal surface of the cranium, some passing upwards over tbe parietal bone as far as the vertex, and others backwards to the occipital bone. The posterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal, and on the inner surface of the parietal bone divides into branches which supply the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The branches of this vessel are distributed partly to the dura mater, but chiefly to the bones ; they anastomose with the arteries of the opposite side, and with the anterior and posterior meningeal. The middle meningeal, on entering the cranium, gives off the following colla- teral branches :—i. Numerous small vessels to the ganglion of the fifth nerve, and to the dura mater in this situation. 2. A branch to the facial nerve, which enters the hiatus Eallopii, suppKes the facial nerve, and anastomoses with the stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. 3. Orbital branches, which pass through the sphenoidal fissure, or through separate canals in the great wing of the sphenoid to anastomose with the lachrymal or other branches of the ophthalmic artery. 4. Temporal branches, which pass through foramina in the great wing of the sphenoid, and anastomose in the temporal fossa with the deep temporal arteries. The small meningeal is sometimes derived from the preceding. It enters the skull through the foramen ovale, and supplies the Casserian ganglion and dura mater. Before entering the cranium, it gives off a branch to the nasal fossa and soft palate. The i>,ferior dental descends with the dental nerve, to the foramen on the inner side of the ramus of the jaw. It runs along the dental canal in the substance of the bone, accompanied by the nerve, and opposite the first bicuspid tooth divides into two branches, incisor and mental: the former is continued forwards beneath the incisor teeth as far as the symphisis, where it anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side ; the mental brauch escapes with the nerve at the mental foramen,ARTERIES. 348 supplies the structures composing the chin, and anastomoses with the submental, interior labial, and iiiTci-ior coronary D-rtorios. As the dental artery enters the foramen, it gives olF a niylo-liyoid branch, which runs in the Mylo-hyoid groove, and ramilics on the under surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle. The dental and incisor arteries during their course through the suljstance of the bone give off a few twio-s which arc lost in the cancellous tissue, and a series of branches which correspond in number to the roots of the teeth : these enter the minute apertures at the extremities of the fangs, and supply the pulp of the teeth. BUANCUES OF TUB SECOND, OR P'fERYGOID PORTION. Deep Temporal. Masseteric. Pterygoid. Buccal. These branches are distributed, as their names imply, to the muscles in the maxillary region. The deep temporal hranches, two in number, anterior and posterior, each occupy that part of the temporal fossa indicated by its name. Ascending between the temporal muscle and pericranium, they supply that muscle, and anastomose with the other temporal arteries ; the anterior branch communicating with the lachrymal through small branches which perforate the malar bone, and great wing of the sphenoid. The pterygoid Iranches, irregular in their number and origm, supply the Pterygoid muscles. . ., The masseteric is a small branch which passes outwards above the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, to the deep surface of the Masseter. It supplies that muscle, and anastomoses with the masseteric branches of the facial and with the transverse facial artery. .r. t i i The luccal: is a small branch which runs obliquely forwards between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the jaw, to the outer surface of the Buccinator, to which it is distributed, anastomosing with branches of the facial artery.

The ptery>jo-paMine is also a very small branch, which passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pharyngeal nerve, and is distributed to the upper part of the pharynx and Eustachian tube. The nasal or splieno-palatine passes through the spheno-palatine foramen into the cavity of the nose, at the back part of the superior meatus, and divides into two branches ; one internal, the artery of the septum, passes obliquely downwards and forwards along the septum nasi, suppHes the mucous membrane, and anasto- moses in front with the ascending branch of the descending palatine. The external branches, two or three in number, supply the mucous membrane covering the lateral wall of the nose, the antrum, and the ethmoid and sphenoid cells. SuKGicAL Anatomy of the Triangles of the Neck. The student having considered the relative anatomy of the large arteries of the neck and their branches, and the relations they bear to the veins and nerves, should now examine these structures collectively, as they present themselves in certain regions of the neck, in each of which important operations are being constantly performed. For this purpose, the Sterno-mastoid, or any other muscles that have been divided in the dissection of the vessels, should be replaced in their normal position ; the head should be supported by placing a block at the back of the neck, and the face turned to the side opposite to that which is being examined. The side of the neck presents a somewhat quadrilateral outline, limited, above, by the lower border of the body of the jaw, and an imaginary line extending from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; below, by the prominent upper border of the clavicle ; in front, by the median line of the neck ; behind, by the anterior margin of the Trapezius muscle. This space is subdivided into two large triangles by the Sterno-mastoid muscle, which passes obliquely across the neck, from the sternum and clavicle, below, to the mastoid process, above. The triangular space in front of this muscle, is called the anterior triangle ; and that behind it, the posterior triangle. Anterior Triangular Space. The anterior triangle is limited, in front, by a line extending fi-om the chin to the sternum ; behind, by the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid ; its base, directed upwards, is formed by the lower border of the body of the jaw, and a line extendmg from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process; its apex is below, at the sternum. The space is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia; it is crossed by branches of the facial and superficial cervical nerves, and is subdivided into three smaller triangles by the Digastric muscle, above, and the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoid, below. These smaller triangles are named from below upwards, the inferior carotid, the superior carotid, and the submaxillary triangle. The Inferior Carotid Triangle is limited, in front, by the median line of the350 ARTERIES. neck; beliind, by tlio anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid; above, by Ibo anterior belly of the Omo-liyoid ; and is covered by tlio integument, superficial fascia, Platysma,and deep fascia; ramifying between which is seen the descending branch of the suporiicialis colli nerve. Beneath these superficial structures, are. the Storno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, which, together with the anterior margin of the Storuo-raastoid, conceal the lower part of the common carotid artery.* . , • i This vessel is enclosed within its sheath, together with the internal jugular vein, and pncuniogastric nerve ; the vein lying on the outer side of the artery on tl'ie right side of the neck, but overlapping it, or passing directly acro.ss it on the left side ; the nerve lying between the artery and vein, on a plane posterior to both. In front of the sheath are a few filaments descending from the loop of communication between the descendens and communicans noni; behind the sheath are seen the inferior thyroid artery, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the sympathetic nerve ; and on its inner side, the trachea, the thyroid gland, much more prominent in the female than in the male, and tlie lower part of the larynx. By cutting into the upper part of this space, and slightly displacing the Sterno-mastoid muscle, the common carotid artery may be tied below the Omo- hyoid muscle. -nil The Superior Carotid Triangleis bounded, behind, by the Sterno-mastoid; below, by the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoid ; and above, by the posterior belly of the Digastric muscle. Its floor is formed by parts of the Thyro-hyoid, Hyo-glossus, and the inferior and middle Constrictor muscles of the pharynx; and it is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia; ramifying between which, are branches of the facial and superficialis colli nerves. This space contains the upper part of the common carotid artery, which bifurcates opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage into the external and internal carotid These vessels are occasionally somewhat concealed from view by the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, which overlaps them. The ex- ternal and internal carotids lie side by side, the external being the more anterior of the two The following branches of the external carotid are also met with m this space : the superior thyroid, running forwards and downwards; the lingual directly forwards; the facial, forwards and upwards; the occipital, backwards; and the ascending pharyngeal directly upwards on the inner side of the mternal carotid The veins met with are : the internal jugular, which lies on the outer side of'the common and internal carotid arteries ; and veins corresponding to the above-mentioned branches of the external carotid, viz. the superior thyi-oid the lingual, facial, ascending pharyngeal, and sometimes the occipital ; all of which accompany their corresponding arteries, and terminate m the mternal jugular. The nerves in this space are the following :-In front of the sheath of the common carotid is the descendens noni. The hypoglossal nerve crosses both carotids above, curvino- round the occipital artery at its origin. Within the sheath, between the artervtnd vein, and behind both, is the pneumogastric nerve ; behmd the sheath, the svmpathetic. On the outer side of the vessels, the spinal accessory nerve mns for a short distance before it pierces the Sterno-mastoid muscle; and on the mner side of the internal carotid, just below the hyoid bone, may be seen the superior laryngeal nerve; and stHl more inferiorly, the external laryngeal nerve.

The floor of this space is formed by the anterior belly of the Digastric the Mylo-hyoid, and Hyo-glossus muscles; and it is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia ; ramifying between which are branches of the facial and ascending filaments of the superficia cervica nerve. This space contains, in front, the submaxillary gland, imbedded in the substance of which are the facial ai-tery and vein, and their glandular br^anches; beneath this gland on the surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, are the submental artery, and the mylo-hyoid artery and nerve. The back part of this space is separated from the front part by the stylo-maxillary ligament; it contains the external carotid artery, ascending deeply in the substance of the parotid gland; this vessel here lies m front of, and superficial to, the internal carotid, being crossed by the facial nerve, and gives off" in its course the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary branches ; more deeply is the internal carotid, the internal jugular vein, and the pneumo- gastric nerve, separated from the external carotid by the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve.* PosTERiOK Triangular Space. The posterior triangular space is bounded, in front by the Sterno-mastoid muscle ; behind, by the anterior margin of the Trapezius ; its base corresponds to the upper border of the clavicle ; its apex, to the occiput. The space is crossed about an inch above the clavicle, by the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid, which divides it unequally into two, an upper or snboccipital, and a lower or subclavian triangle. The Suboccipital, the larger of the two posterior triangles, is bofunded, in front by the Sterno-mastoid ; behind, by the Trapezius ; below, by the Omo-hyoid. Its floor is formed from above downwards by the Splenins, Levator anguli scapulae, and the middle and posterior Scaleni muscles. It is covered by the integument, the Platysma below, the superficial and deep fascijB ; and crossed, above, by the ascending branches of the cervical plexus ; the spinal accessory nerve is directed obliquely across the space from the Sterno-mastoid, which it pierces, to the under surface of the Trapezius; below, the descending branches of the cervical plexus and the transversalis colli artery and vein cross the space. A chain of lymphatic glands is also found running along the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, from the mastoid process to the root of the neck. The Subclavian, the smaller of the two posterior triangles, is bounded, above, by the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid ; below, by the clavicle ; its base, directed forwards, being formed by the Sterno-mastoid. The size of this space varies according to the extent of attachment of the clavicular portion of the Sterno- mastoid and Trapezius muscles, and also according to the height at which the Omo-hyoid crosses the neck above the clavicle. The height also of this space varies much, according to the position of the arm, being much diminished by raising the limb, on account of the ascent of the clavicle, and increased by drawing the arm downwards, when that bone is depressed. This space is covered by the integument, superficial and deep fascia: and crossed by the descending branches of the cervical plexus. Just above the level of the clavicle, the third portion of the subclavian artery curves outwards and downwards from the outer margin of the Scalenus anticus, across the first rib to the axilla.

Occasionally, it passes in front of tbo Scalenus anticns, or pierces tiic fil)rcs of tliat muKclc. Tiio subclavian vein lies behind the clavicle, and is usually not seen in this S[)ace; but it occasionally rises as high up as the artery, and has oven been seen to pass with that vessel behind the°Scalenus anticus. The brachial plexus of nerves lies above the artery and in close contact with it. Passing transversely across the clavicular margin of the space, are the suprascapular vessels ; and traversing its upper angle in the same direction, the transverse cervical vessels. The external jugular vein runs vertically dowi'i wards beliind the posterior border of the Sterno-niastoid, to terminate in the Subclavian vein; it receives the ti-ansverse cervical and suprascapular veins, which occasionally form a plexus in front of the artery, and a small vein which crosses the clavicle from the cephalic. The small nerve to the subclavius also crosses this triangle about its middle. A lymphatic gland is also found in tho space. Internal Carotid Artery. The internal carotid artery commences at the bifurcation of the common carotid, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and runs perpendicularly up- wards, in front of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebra, to the carotid foramen in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. After ascending in it for a sbort distance, it passes forwards and inwards through the carotid canal, and, again ascending a little by tbe side of the sella Turcica, carves upwards by the anterior clinoid process, where it pierces the dura mater, and divides into it« terminal branches. This vessel supplies the anterior part of the brain, the eye, and its appendages. Its size, in the adult, is equal to that of tho external carotid. In the child, it is larger than that vessel. It is remarkable for the number of curvatures that it presents in different parts of its course. In its cervical portion it occasionally presents one or two flexures near the base of the skull, whilst through the rest of its extent it describes a double curvature which resembles the italic letter / placed horizontally ~. These curvatures most probably diminish the velocity ot the current of blood, by increasing the extent of surface over whicb it moves, and adding to the amount of impediment produced from friction. In considering the- course and relations of this vessel, it may be conveniently divided into four por- tions : a cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral. Cervical Portion. This portion of the internal carotid is superficial at its com- mencement, being contained in the superior carotid triangle, and lying on the same level as the external carotid, but behind that artery, overlapped by the Sterno-mastoid, and covered by the Platysma, deep fascia, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossa nerve, the Dio-astric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and the external carotid and occipital arteries Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the Stylo-glossus and Stvlo-pharyngeus muscles, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and pharyngeal branch of the pneumoo-astric. It is in relation, helmid, witb the Rectus capitis anticus major, the superior"cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and superior laryngeal nerve ; ex- ternalhj, with the internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve; tnternnlly, witU the pharynx, tonsil, and ascending pharyngeal artery. i • . Petrous Portion. When the internal carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves forwards and inwards, and again ascends as it leaves the canal to enter the cavity of the skull. In this canal, the artery lies at fii-st anterior to the tympanum, from which it is separated by a thin bony lamella, which is cribnform in the • young subject, and often absorbed in old age. It is sepai-ated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by fila- ments of the carotid plexus. , o •. «f Cavernous Portiol The internal carotid artery, in this part of its course at first ascends to tlie posterior clinoid process, then passes forwards by the side353 INTERNAL CAROTID. tLe body of the sphenoid bone, being situated on the inner wall of the cavernous sinus, in relation, externally, with the sixth nerve, and covered by the lining membrane of the sinus.

A branch is also sent backwards, through the sphenoidal fissure, to the dum mater, which anastomoses with a branch of the 1^ middle meningeal artery.356 AilTKUiKS. Pcculiarilics. The lachrymal artery is sometimes derived from one of the anterior branches of the middle meuingeal artery. The mpraorhUal artery, the largest branch of the ophthalmic, arises from that vessel above the optic nerve. Ascending so as to rise above all the_ muscles of the orbit it passes forwards, with the frontal nerve, between the periosteum and Levator palpebrffi; and passing through the supraorbital foramen, divides into a superficial and deep branch, which supply the muscles and integument of the forehead and pericranium, anastomosing with the temporal, the angular branch of the facial, and the artery of the opposite side. This artery in the orbit supplies the Superior rectus and the Levator palpebra3, sends a branch inwards, across the , pulley of the Superior obhque muscle, to supply the parts at the inner canthus, and, at the supraorbital foramen, frequently transmits a branch to the diploe. The ethmoidal hravches are two in number; posterior and anterior. The former, which is the smaller, passes through the posterior ethmoidal foramen, supplies the posterior ethmoidal cells, and entering the cranium, gives off a meningeal branch, which supplies the adjacent dui-a mater, and nasal branches which^'desccnd into the nose through apertures in the cribriform plate, anasto- mosiuo- with branches of the spheno-palatine. The anterior ethmoidal artery accompanies the nasal nerve through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, supplies the anterior ethmoidal cells and frontal sinuses, and, entering the cramum, divides into a meningeal branch, which supplies the adjacent dura mater, and a nasal branch which descends into the nose, through an aperture m the cribriform plate The palpebral arteries, two in number, superior and inferior, anse from the ophthalmic, opposite the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle; they encircle the evelids near their free margin, forming a superior and an inferior arch, which lie between the orbicularis muscle and tarsal cartilages; the superior palpebral inosculating at the outer angle of the orbit with the orbital branch of the temporal artery, the inferior palpebral with the orbital branch of the mfra- orbital artery, at tho inner side of the lid.

Tliis vessel gives off most of the anterior ciliary arteries. ■ The Cerebral hunches of the internal carotid are: the anterior cerebral, the middle cerebral, the posterior communicating, and the anterior choroid.358 ARTERIES. Tho anterior cerebral arises from the internal carotid, at tlie inner extremity of the fissnre of Sylvins. It passos forwards in the groat longitudinal fissure between tho two anterior lobes of tlio brain, l)oing connected, soon after its origin, with the vessel of tho opposite side by a short anastomosing trunk, about two lines in length, the anterior conmmmicating. The two anterior cerebral arteries, lying side by side, cnrve round tho anterior border of the corpus callosum, and run along its upper surface to its posterior pari., where tliey terminate by anastomosing with tho posterior cerebral arteries. They supply the olfactory and optic nerves, the under aurfaco of tho anterior lobes, the third ventricle, the anterior perforated space, the corpus callosum, and tho. inferior surfaco of the hemispheres. Tho anterior commwiicatmg artery is a short branch, about two lines in length, but of moderate size, connecting together the two anterior cerebral arteries across tho longitudinal fissure. Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining too-other to form a single trunk, which afterwards subdivides. Or the vessel may be° wholly or partially subdivided into two ; frequently, it is longer and smaller than usual. The middle cerebral artery, the largest branch of the internal carotid, passes obliquely outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, within which it divides into three branches : an anterior, wbich supplies the pia mater, investing the surfaco of the anterior lobe ; a posterior, which supplies the middle lobe ; and a median branch, which supplies the small lobe at the outer extremity of the Sylvian fissure. Near its origin, this vessel gives off numerous small branches, which enter the substantia perforata, to be distributed to the corpus striatum. The posterior commionicating artery arises from the back part of the internal carotid, runs directly backwards, and anastomoses with the posterior cerebral, a branch'of the basilar. This artery varies considerably in size, being sometimes small, and occa-sionally so large that the posterior cerebral may be considered as arising from the internal carotid rather than from the basilar. It is frequently larger on one side than on the other side. . . xi u i The anterior choroid is a small but constant branch which arises from the back part of the internal carotid, near the posterior communicatmg artery Passing backwards and outwards, it enters the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, beneath the edge of the middle lobe of the brain. It is distributed to the hippo- campus major, corpus fimbriatum, and choroid plexus. ARTERIES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The artery which supplies the upper extremity, continues as a single trunk from its commencement down to the elbow, but different portions of it have received different names, according to the region through which it passes That part o the vessel which extends from its origin to the outer border of the first rib s termed the subclavian; beyond this point to the lower border of the axilla, it is termed the axillary ; and from the lower margin of the axillary space to the bend of the elbow, it is termed brachial; here, the single trunk terminates by dividing into two branches, the radial and ulnar, an arrangement precisely similar to what occurs in the lower limb. Subclavian Arteries. Tho subclavian artery on the right side arises from the arteria innominaia, oppit tfet^rst^rno^clavieular articulation ; on the left side it a-es frcnn the arch of the aorta. It follows, therefore, that these two vessels must, n he fii^ part of their course, ' differ in their length, their direction, and their relation witil "^ttrtTfldUtate the descnption of these v-els, more especially in a sur. • „1 „„,„t nf view eacli stibdavian artcvy liM been divided into tliree parK- K flrTportL ol' rXlt side, ascends'oblique,, outwards, from the ongni o!359 SUBCLAVIAN. the vessel to the inner border of the Scalenus anticus.

The right subclavian artery arises from the arteria innomlnata. opposite the right sterno-clavicular articulation, passes upwards and outwards across the root of he neck, and terminates at the inner margin of the Scalenus anticus muscle. In this part of its course it ascends a little above the clavicle, the extent to which it does so varying in different cases. It is covered, in front, by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the Stemo-mastoid the Sterno- hyoid aud Sterno-thyroid muscles, and another layer of the deep fascia, it is crossed by the internal jugular and vertebral veins, and by the pneumogastric, the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, and the phrenic nerve. Beneath, the artery is invested by the pleura, and behind, it is separated by a cellular interval from the Longus colli, the transverse process of the seventh cervical or first dorsal vertebra, and the sym'pathetic; the recurrent laryngeal nerve winding around the lower and back part of the vessel. The subclavian vein lies below the subclavian artery, immediately behind the clavicle. Plan of Relations of First Portion of Right Subclavlw^ Artery. In front. Clavicular origin of Sterno-mastoid.

The left subclavian artery arises from the end of the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, opposite the third dorsal vertebra, and ascends to the inner margin of the first rib, behind the insertion of the Scalenus anticus muscle. This vessel is, therefore, longer than the right, situated more deeply in the cavity of the chest, and directed almost vertically upwards, instead of arching outwards like the vessel of the opposite side.

The Subclavian arteries vary in their origin, their course, and the height to which they rise in the neck. The origin of the right subclavian from the innominate takes place, in some cases, above the sterno-clavicular articulation ; and occasionally, but less frequently, in the cavity of the thorax, below that joint. Or the artery may arise as a separate trunk from the arch of the aorta. In such cases it may be either the first, second, third, or even the last branch derived from that vessel; in the majority of cases, it is the first or last, rarely the second or third. "When it is the first branch, it occupies the ordinary position of the innominate artery; when the second or third, it gains its usual position by passing behind the right carotid; and when the last branch, it arises from the left extremity of the arch, at its upper or back part, and '-passes obliquely towards the right side, usually behind the oesophagus and right carotid, sometimes between the oesophagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib, whence it follows its ordinary course. In very rare instances, this vessel arises from the thoracic aorta, as low down as the fourth dorsal vertebra. Occasionally, it perforates the Anterior Scalenus; more rai'ely it passes in front of that muscle : sometimes the subclavian vein passes with the artery behind the Scalenus. The artery sometimes ascends as high as an inch and a half above the clavicle, or any intermediate point between this and the upper border of the bone, the right subclavian usually ascending higher than the left. ; The left subclavian is occasionally joined at its origin with the left carotid. Surgical Anatomy. The relations of the subclavian arteries of the two sides having been examined, the student should direct his attention to consider the best position in which compression of the vessel may be effected, or in what situation a ligature may be best applied in cases of aneurism or wound. Compression of the subclavian artej-yia required in cases of operations about the shoulder, in the axilla, or at the upper part of the arm; and the student will observe that there is only one situation in which it can be eifectually applied, viz., where the artery passes across the outer surface of the first rib. In order to compress the vessel in this situation, the shoulder should he depressed, and the surgeon grasping the side of the neck, may press with his thumb in the hollow behind the clavicle downwards against the rib; if from any cause the shoulder cannot be sufficiently depressed, pressure mav be made from before backwards, so as to compress the artery against the Middle Scalenus" and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. In appropriate cases, a preliminary incision may be made through the cervical fascia, and the finger may be pressed down directly upon the artery. Ligattu-e of the subclavian artery maybe required in cases of wounds, or of aneurism in the axilla; and the third part of the artery is that which is most favourable for an operation, on account ot its being comparatively superficial, and most remote from the origin of the large branches. In those cases where the clavicle is not displaced, this operation may be performed with comparative facility ; but where the clavicle is pushed up L a large aneu- nsmal tumour m the axilla, the artery is placed at a great depth from the surface, which ZlZ }l '°"''f/ f operation.

Tlie external jugular vein will now be seen towards the inner side of tiie wound: this and the suprascapular and transverse cervical veins whicli terminate in it should be held aside, and if divided, both ends should be tied : the supriuscapular artery should be avoided, and tlie Onio-liyoid muscle must now bo looked for, and held aside if necessary In the space beneath this muscle, careful search must be made for the vessel: the deep fascia having been divided with the finger-nail or silver scalpel, the outer margin of the Scale- nus muscle must bo felt for, and the linger being guided by it to the lirst rib, the pulsation of the subclavian artery will be felt as it passes over the rib. The aneurism needle may tlien be passed around the vessel from before backwards, by which means the vein will be avoided, care being taken not to include a branch of the brachial plexus instead of the artery in the ligature. If the clavicle is so raised by the tumour that the application of the ligature cannot be eflected m this situation, the artery may be tied above the tirst rib, or even behind the Scalenus muscle; the difficulties of the operation in such a case will be mate- rially increased, on account of the greater depth of the artery, and the alteration in position of the surrounding parts. ^ The second part of the subclavian artery, from being that portion which rises highest in the neck, has been considered favourable for the application of the ligature, when it is difficult to tie the artery _m the third part of its course. There are, however, many objections to the operation in this situation. It is necessary to divide the Scalenus anticus muscle, upon which lies the phrenic nerve, and at the inner side of which is situated the internal jugular vein; and a wound of either of these structures might lead to the most dangerous consequences! Again, the artery is in contact, below, with the pleura, which must also be avoided; and, lastly, the proximity of so many of its larger branches arising internal to this point, must be a still further objection to the operation. If, however, it has been determined to perform the operation in this situation, it should be remembered that it occasionally happens, that the artery passes in front of the Scalenus anticus, or through the fibres of that muscle ; and that the vein sometimes passes with the artery behind the Scalenus anticus. In those cases of aneurism of the axillary or subclavian artery which encroach upon the outer portion of the Scalenus muscle to such an extent that a ligature cannot be applied in that situation, it may be deemed advisable, as a last resource, to tie the tirst portion of the subclavian artery. On the left side, this operation is almost impracticable ; the great depth of the artery from the surface, its intimate relation with the pleura, and its close' proximity to so many important veins and nerves, present a series of difficulties which it is next to impossible to overcome.* On the right side, the operation is practicable, and has been per- formed, though not with success. The main objection to the operation in this situation is the smallness of the interval which usually exists between the commencement of the vessel, and the origin of the nearest branch. This operation may be performed in the following man- ner :—The patient being placed on the table in the horizontal position, with the neck ex- tended, an incision should be made parallel with the posterior border of the inner part of the clavicle, and a second along the inner border of the Sterno-mastoid, meeting the former at an angle. The sternal attachment of the Sterno-mastoid may now be divided on a director, and turned outwards ; a few small arteries and veins, and occasionally the anterior jugular, must be avoided, and the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles divided in the same manner as the preceding muscle. After tearing through the deep fascia with the finger-nail, the internal jugular vein will be seen crossing the subclavian artery ; this should be pressed aside, and the artery secured by passing the needle from below upwards, by which the pleura is more eft'ectually avoided. The exact position of the vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal, the phrenic and sympathetic nerves should be remembered, and the ligature should be applied near the origin of the vertebral, in order to afford as much room as possible for the formation of a coagulum between the ligature and the origin of the vessel. It should be remembered, that the right subclavian artery is occasionally deeply plficed in the first part of its course, when it arises from the left side of tlie aortic arch, and passes in such cases behind the oesophagus, or between it and the trachea. Collateral Circulation. After ligature of the third part of the subclavian artery, the collateral circulation is mainly established by three sets of vessels, thus described in a dis- section :— ' I. A posterior set, consisting of the suprascapular and posterior scapular branches of the subcl avian, which anastomosed with the inlrascapular from the axillary. * 2. An internal set produced by the connection of the internal mammary on the one hand, with the short and long thoracic arteries, and the infrascapular on the other. ' 3.

Throe arisin"- from the first portion of the vessel, the vertebral, tlie internal mammary, and the thyroid axis ; and one from the second portion, the superior intercostal. The vertebral arises from the upper and back part of the first portion of the artery; the thyroid axis from the front, and the in- ternal mammary from the under part of this vessel. The superior intercostal is given ofi" from the upper and back part of the second portion of the artery. On the left side, the second portion usually gives ofi" no branch, the superior inter- costal arising at the inner side of the Scalenus anticus. On both sides of the body, the first three branches arise close together at the inner margin of the Sca- lenus anticus ; in the majority of cases, a free interval of half an inch to an inch existing between the commencement of the artery and the origin of the nearest branch; in a smaller number of cases, an interval of more than an inch exists, never exceeding an inch and three-quarters. In a very few instances, the interval has been found less than half an inch. The Vertebral Artery (fig. 212) is generally the first and largest branch of the subclavian; it arises from the upper and back part of the first portion of tbe vessel, and, passing upwards, enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra,t and ascends through the foramina in the transverse pro- cesses of all the vertebrae above this. Above the upper border of the axis, it in- clines outwards and upwards to the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, through which it passes ; it then winds backwards behind its articular pro- cess, runs in a deep groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of this bone, and, piercing the posterior occipito-atloid ligament and dura mater, enters the skull through the foramen magnum. It then passes in front of the medulla oblongata, and unites with the vessel of the opposite side at the lower border of the pons Varolii, to form the basilar artery. At its origin, it is situated behind the internal jugular vein, and inferior thyroid artery ; and, near the spine, lies between the Longus colli and Scalenus anticus muscles, having the thoracic duct in front of it on the left side. Within the foramina formed by the transverse processes of the vertebra, it is accompanied by a plexus of nerves from the sympathetic, and lies between the vertebral vein, which is in front, and the cervical nerves, which issue from the intervertebral foramina behind it. Whilst winding round the articular process of the atlas, it is contained in a tri- angular space formed by the Rectus posticus major, the Superior and the Inferior oblique muscles; and is covered by the Rectus posticus major and Complexus.

Branches. These may be divided into two sets, those given off in the neck, and those within the cranium. Cervical Branches, Cra/iiial Branches. Lateral spinal. Posterior meningeal. Muscular. Anterior spinal. Posterior spinal. Inferior cerebellar. The lateral spinal branches enter the spinal canal through tho intervei-tebral foramina, each dividing into two branches. Of those one passes along the roots of the nerves to supply the spinal cord and its membranes, anastomosing with the other spinal arteries ; the other is distributed to the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebroo. Muscular branches are given off to the deep muscles of the neck, where the vertebral artery curves round the articular process of the atlas. They anastomose with the occipital and deep cervical arteries. The posterior meningeal are one or two small branches given off from the vertebral opposite the foramen magnum. They ramify between the bone and dura mater in the cerebellar fossse, and supply the falx cerebelli. The anterior spinal is a small branch, larger than the posterior spinal, which arises near the termination of the vertebral, and unites with its fellow of the opposite side in front of the medulla oblongata. The single trunk, thus formed, descends a short distance on the front of the spinal cord, and joins with a succession of small branches which enter the spinal canal through some of the intervertebral foramina ; these branches are derived from the vertebral and ascend- ing cervical in the neck ; from the intercostal, in the dorsal region ; and from the lumbar, ilio-lumbar, and lateral sacral arteries in the lower part of the spine. They unite, by means of ascending and descending branches, to form a single anterior median artery, which extends as far as the lower part, of the spinal cord. This vessel is placed beneath the pia mater along the anterior median fissure; it supphes that membrane, and the substance of the cord, and sends off branches at its lower part to be distributed to the cauda equina. The posterior spinal arises from the vertebral, at the side of the medulla oblongata ; passing backwards to the posterior aspect of the spinal cord, it descends on either side, lying behind the posterior roots of the spinal nerves ; and is re- inforced by a succession of small branches, which enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina, and by which it is continued to the lower part of the cord and to the cauda equina. Branches from these vessels form a free anasto- mosis round the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, and communicate, by means of very tortuous transverse branches, with the vessel of the opposite side. At its commencement, it gives off an ascending branch, which terminates on the side of the fourth ventricle. , ^ ^, ^ i i • j„ The inferior cerebellar artery (fig. 214), the largest branch of the vertebral, winds backwards round the upper part of the medulla oblongata, passing between the origin of the spinal accessory and pneumogastric nerves, over the restiform body to the under surface of the cerebellum, where it divides into two branches : an internal one which is continued backwards to the notch between the two hemispheres ot the cerebellum ; and an external one, which supplies the under surface of the cere- bellum, as far as its outer border, where it anastomoses with the superior cerebellar. Branches from this artery supply the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle _ The Basilar artery, so named from its position at the base of Uie skull, is a single trunk formed by the junction of the two vertebral arteries ; it extends trom the posterior to the anterior border of the pons Varolii, where it divides into two terminal branches, tho posterior cerebral arteries. Its branches are, on each side, the following:365 THYROID AXIS. „ Superior cerebellar. Transverse. -r^ K • 1 i . , . 1 „n„„ Posterior cerebral.

Several branches are given to the pineal eland, and also to the velum interpositum. « ^i, •!„ The vostenor cerebral arteries, the two terminal branches of the basilar, are larger than the preceding, from which they are separated near their ongin by tlie third nerves. Winding round the crus cerebri, they pass to the under s^irface ot the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, which they supply, anastomosing with the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Near their origin, they receive the posterior communicating arteries from the internal carotid, and give off numerous branches, which enter the posterior perforated space : they also give off a branch, the posterior choroid, which supplies the velum interpositum and choroid plexus, entering the interior of the brain beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum. Circle of Willis. The remarkable anastomosis which exists between the branches of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries at the base of the brain, constitutes the circle of WilKs. It is formed, in front, by the anterior cerebral and anterior ' communicating arteries ; on each side, by the trunk of the internal carotid, and the posterior communicating; behind, by the posterior cerebral, and point of the basilar. It is by this anastomosis that the cerebral circulation is equalised, and provision made for effectually carrying it on if one or more of the branches are obliterated. The parts of the brain included within this arterial circle are, the lamina cinerea, the commissure of the optic nerves, the infundibulum, the tuber cinereum, the corpora albicantia, and the posterior perforated space. The Thyroid Axis (fig. 207) is a short thick trunk, which arises from the fore ■part of the first portion of the subclavian artery, close to the inner border of the Scalenus anticus muscle, and divides, almost immediately after its origin, into three branches, the inferior thyroid, suprascapular, and transversalis colli. The Inferioe Thyroid Artery passes upwards, in a serpentine course, behind the sheath of the common carotid vessel and sympathetic nerve (the middle cervical ganglion resting upon it), and is distributed to the under surface of the tbyroid gland, anastomosing with the superior thyroid, and with the correspond- ing artery of the opposite side. Its branches are the Laryngeal, CBsophageal. Tracheal. Ascending cervical. The laryngeal branch ascends upon the trachea to the back part of the larynx, and supplies the muscles and mucous membrane of this part. The tracheal branches are distributed upon the trachea, anastomosing below with the bronchial arteries. The oesophageal branches are distributed to the oesophagus. The ascending cervical is a small branch which arises from the inferior thyroid, just where that vessel is passing behind the common carotid artery, and runs up the neck in the interval between the Scalenus anticus and Eectus anticus major. It gives branches to the muscles of the neck, which communicate with those sent out from the vertebral, and sends one or two through the intervertebral foramina, along the cervical nerves, to supply the bodies of the vertebra), the spinal cord, and its membranes. The Suprascapular Artery, smaller than the transversalis colli, passes ob- liquely from within outwards, across the root of the neck. It at first lies onARTERIES. 366 the lower part of tlio Scalenus anticus, being covered by the Sterno-mastoid ; it then crosses the subclavian artery, and runs outwards behind and jmrallel with the clavicle and Subclavius muscle, and beneath the posterior belly of the Omo- hyoid, to the superior border of the scapula, where it passes over the transverse ligament of the scapula, to the supraspinous fossa. In this situation it lies close to the bono, and ramifies between it and the Supraspinatus muscle, to which it is mainly distributed, giving olF a communicating branch, which crosses the neck of the scapula, to roach the infraspinons fossa, where it anastomoses with the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. Besides distributing branches to the Storno- mastoid, and neighbouring muscles, it gives olf a supra-acromial branch, which, piercing the Trapezius muscle, supplies the cutaneous surface of the acromion, anastomosing with the acromial thoracic artery. As the artery passes over the' transverse ligament of the scapula, a branch descends into the subscapular fossa, 216.—The Scapular and Circumflex Arteries.

It also supplies the shoulder-joint. The Transveesalis Colli passes transversely outwards, across the upper part of the subclavian triangle, to the anterior margin of the Trapezius muscle, beneath which it divides into two branches, the superficial cervical, and the posterior scapular. In its passage across the neck, it crosses in front of the Scaleni muscles and the brachial plexus, between the divisions of which it sometimes passes, and is covered by the Platysma, Sterno-mastoid, Omo-hyoid, and Trapezius muscles. The superficial cervical ascends beneath the anterior margin of the Trapezius, distributing branches to it, and to the neighbouring muscles and glands in the '^^'^The posterior scwpular, the continuation of the transversalis colli, passes beneath the Levator anguli'scaputo to the posterior angle of the scapula, and descends along the posterior border of that bone as far as the inferior angle, where it anastomoses with the subscapular branch of the axillary. In its course^ it is covered by the Rhomboid muscles, supplying these, the Latissimus dorsi and Trapezius, and anastomosing with the suprascapular and subscapular ai-teries, and with the posterior branches of some of the intercostal arteries. Peculiarities The superfidd cervical frequently arises as a separate branch from the tbySxL • and the posirior scapular, from the t^ird, more rarely from the second, part of the subclavian.INTERNAL MAMMARY. 367 The Internal Mammary arises from tbe under surface of the first portion of the sabch^vi^ln artery, opposite the tliyroid axis. It descends behind the clavicle to the inner surface of tbe anterior wall of the chest, resting upon the costa caa'tilao.es a short distance from the margin of the sternum; and, at the interval between the sixth and seventh cartilages, divides into two branches, the musculo- phrenic, and superior epigastric. , , i • • i At its orioin, it is covered by the internal jugular and subclavian veins, and crossed by the phrenic nerve. In the upper part of the thorax, it lies upon the costal cartilages, and internal Intercostal muscles in front, and is covered by the pleura behind. At the lower part of the thorax, the Triangularis sterni sepamtes the ai-tery from the pleura. It is accompanied by two veins, which join at the tipper part of the thorax into a single trunk. The branches of the internal mammary are— Comes nervi phrenici (superior phrenic). Anterior Intercostal. Mediastinal. Perforating. Pericardiac. Masculo-phrenic. Sternal. Superior epigastric. The conies nervi phrenici (superior phrenic), is a long slender branch, which accompanies the phrenic nerve, between the pleura and pericardium, to the Diaphragm, to which it is distributed ; anastomosing with the other phrenic arteries from the internal mammary, and abdominal aorta. The mediastinal branches are small vessels, which are distributed to the areolar tissue in the anterior mediastinum, and the remains of the thymus gland. The pericardiox branches supply the upper part of the pericardium, the lower part receiving branches from the muscnlo-phrenic artery. Some sternal branches are distributed to the Triangularis sterni, and both surfaces of the sternum. The anterior intercostal arteries supply the five or six upper intercostal spaces. The branch corresponding to each space passes outwards, and soon divides into two, which run along the opposite borders of the ribs, and inosculate with the intercostal arteries from the aorta. They are at first situated between the pleura and the internal Intercostal muscles, and then between the two layers of those muscles. They supply the Intercostal and Pectoral muscles, and the mammary gland. Tlhe perforating arteries correspond to the five or six upper intercostal spaces. They arise from the internal mammary, pass forwards through the intercostal spaces, and, curving outwards, supply the Pectoralis major, and the integument. Those which correspond to the first three spaces, are distributed to the mammary gland. In females, during lactation, these branches are of large size. The musculo-phrenic artery is directed obliquely downwards and outwards, 1 behind the cartilages of the false ribs, perforating the Diaphragm at the eighth or ninth rib, and terminating, considerably reduced in size, opposite the last inter- costal space. It gives off anterior intercostal arteries to each of the intercostal spaces across which it passes; these diminish in size as the spaces decrease in length, and are distributed in a manner precisely similar to the anterior intercostals from the internal mammary. The musculo-phrenic also gives branches backwards : to the Diaphragm, and downwards to the abdominal muscles. The sxiperior epigastric continues in the original direction of the internal ■ mammary, descends behind the Rectus muscle, and, perforating its sheath, divides mto branches which supply the Rectus, anastomosing with the epigastric artery from the external iliac. Some vessels perforate the sheath of the Rectus, and supply the muscles of the abdomen and the integument, and a small branch which passes inwards upon the side of the ensiform appendix, anastomoses in front of that cartilage with the artery of the opposite side The Superior Intercostal (fig. 212) arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery, behind the anterior scalenus on the right side, and to the inner side of the muscle on the left side. Passing backwards, it gives off the deep cervical branch, and then descends behind the pleura in front of the necks of the368 ARTERIES. first two ribs, and inosculates with the first aortic intercostal. In the first inter costal space, it gives off a branch which is distributed in a manner similar to the distribution of tlie aortic intorcoslals. Tlie branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the first aortic intercostal. Each intercostal gives oif a branch to the posterior spinal muscles, and a small one, which passes throuo-h the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and its membranes. ° The c?ecp cervical branch (profunda carvicis) arises, in most cases, from the superior intercostal, and is analogous to the posterior branch of an aortic inter, costal artery. Passing backwards, between the transverse process of the seventli cervical vertebra and the first rib, it runs up the back part of the neck, between the Complexus and Semispinalis colli muscles, as high as the axis, supplying these and adjacent umscles, and anastomosing with the arteria princeps cervicis of the occipital, and with branches which pass outwards from the vertebral. SuKGiCAL Anatomy of the Axilla. The Axilla is a pyramidal space, situated between the upper and lateral part of the chest, and the inner side of the arm. Boundaries. Its apex, which is directed upwards towards the root of the neck, corresponds to the interval between the two scaleni muscles on the first rib. The lase, directed downwards, is formed by the integument, and a thick layer of fascia, extending between the lower border of the Pectoralis major in front, and the lower border of the Latissimus dorsi behind ; it is broad internally, at the chest, but, narrow and pointed externally, at the arm. The anterior loundary is formed by the Pectoralis major and minor muscles, the former covering the whole of the anterior wall of the axilla, the latter covering only its central part. The posterior loundary, which extends somewhat lower than the anterior, is formed by the Sub- scapularis above, the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi below. On the inner side, are the first four ribs with their corresponding Intercostal muscles, and part of the Serratus magnus. On the outer side, where the anterior and posterior boundaries converge, the space is narrow, and bounded by the humerus, the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps muscles. Contents. This space contains the axillary vessels, and brachial plexus of nerves, with their branches, some branches of the intercostal nerves, and a large number of lymphatic glands, all connected together by a quantity of fat and loose areolar tissue. Thei/r Position. The axillary artery and vein, with the brachial plexus of nerves, extend obliquely along the outer boundary of the axillary space, from its apex to its base, and are placed much nearer the anterior than the posterior wall, the vein lying, to the inner or thoracic side of the artery, and altogether concealing it. At the fore part of the axillary space, in.contact with the Pectoral muscles, are the thoracic branches of the axillary artery, and along the anterior margin of the axilla the long thoracic artery extends to the side of the chest. At the back part, in contact vsrith the lower margin of the Subscapularis muscle, are the subscapular vessels and nerves ; winding around the lower border of this muscle, is the dor- salis scapulae artery and veins; and towards the outer extremity of the muscle, the posterior circumflex vessels and the circumflex nerve are seen curving back- wards to the shoulder. Along the inner or thoracic side no vessel of any importance exists, the upper part of the space being crossed merely by a few small branches from the superior thoracic artery. There are some important nerves, however, in this situation, viz., the posterior thoracic or external respiratory nerve, descending on the surface of the Serratus magnus, to which it is distributed ; and perforating the upper and anterior part of this wall, the intercosto-humei-al nerve or nerves, passing across the axilla to the inner side of the arm. The cavity of the axilla is filled by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, a large number of small arteries and veins, all of which are, however, of inconsiderable size, and numerous lymphatic glands; these are from ten to twelve in number, and situated chiefly on the thoracic side, and lower and back part of this space.AXILLARY. 369 The student should attentively consider the relation of the vessels and norvea in the several parts of the axilla ; for it not unfroqucntly happens that the surgeon is called upon to extirpate diseased glands, or to remove a tumour from this situation. In performing such an operation, it will be necessary to proceed with much caution in the direction of the outer wall and apex of the space, as here the axillary vessels will be in danger of being wounded. Towards the posterior wall, it will bo necessary to avoid the subscapular, dorsahs scaputo, and posterior 217.—The Axillary Artery, and its Branches. circumflex vessels, and, along the anterior wall, the thoracic branches. It is only along the inner or thoracic wall, and in the centre of the axillary cavity, that there are no vessels of any importance; a fortunate circumstance, for it is in this situation more especially that tumours requiring removal are usually situated. The Axillary Artery. The axillary artery, the continuation of the subclavian, commences at the lower border of the first rib, and terminates at the lower border of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major muscles, where it takes the name of brachial. Its direction varies with the position of the limb : when the arm lies by the side of the chest, the vessel forms a gentle curve, the convexity being upwards and outwards; when it is directed at right angles with the trunk, the vessel is nearly straight; and when it is elevated still higher, the artery describes a curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards. At its commencement the artery is very deeply situated, but near its termination is superficial, being covered only by tlio 8km and fascia. The description of the relations of this vessel is facilitated by BB370 ARTERIES. its division into three portions: the first portion being that above the Pectorahs minor; the second portion, behind ; and the third, below that muscle. The first porlion of the axillary artery is in relation, in front, with the cla- vicular portion of the Peotoralis major, the costo-coracoid membrane, the Sub- clavius, and the cephalic vein ; hoMnd, with the first intercostal space, the corre- sponding Intercostal muscle, the iirst serration of the Serratus maguus, and the posterior thoracic nerve ; on its outer side with the brachial plexus, from which it is separated by a little cellular interval; on its mner, or thoracic side, with the axillary vein.

The axillary artery, in about one case out of every ten, gives off a large branch, which forms either one of the arteries of the forearm, or a large muscular trunk. In the first set of cases, this artery is most frequently the radial (i in 33), sometimes the ulnar (i in 72), and, very rarely, the interosseous (i in 506). In the second set of cases, the trunk has been found to give origin to the subscapular, circumflex, and profunda arteries of the arm. Sometimes, only one of the circumflex, or one of the profunda arteries, arose from the trunk. In these cases, the brachial plexus surrounded the trunk of the branches, and not the main vessel. Surgical Anato7ny. The student having carefully examined the relations of the axillary artery in its various parts, should now consider in what situation compression of this vessel may be most easily efiected, and the best position for the application of a ligature to it when necessaiy. Covipression of the vessel is required in the removal of tumours, or in amputation of the upper part of the arm ; and the only situation in which this can be effectually made, is in the lower part of its course ; by pressing on it in this situation from within outwards against the humerus, the circulation may be effectually suspended. The application of a ligature to the axillary artery may be required in cases of aneurism of the upper part of the brachial; and there are only two situations in which it can be secured, viz., in the first and in the third parts of its course ; for the axillary artery at its central part is so deeply seated, and, at the same time, so closely surrounded with large nervous trunks, that the application of a ligature to it in that situation would be almost impracticable. In the third part of its course, the operation is most simple, and may be performed in the following manner:—The patient being placed on a bed, and the arm separated from the side, with the hand supinated, the head of the humerus is felt for, and an incision made through the integument over it, about two inches in length, a little nearer to the anterior than the posterior fold of the axilla. After carefully dissecting through the areolar tissue and fascia, the median nerve and axillary vein are exposed; the former having been dis- placed to the outer, and the latter to the inner side of the arm, the elbow being at the same time bent, so as to relax the structures, and facilitate their separation, the ligature may be passed round the artery from the ulnar to the radial side. This portion of the artery is occasionally crossed by a muscular slip derived from the Latissimus dorsi, which may mis- lead the surgeon during an operation. The occasional existence of this muscular fasciculus was spoken of in the description of the muscles. It may easily be recognised by the trans- verse direction of its fibres. The first portion of the axillary artery may be tied in cases of aneurism encroaching so far upwards that a ligature cannot be applied in the lower part of its course. Notwith- standmg that this operation has been performed in some few cases, and with success, its performance is attended with much difficulty and danger. The student wiU remark that in this situation, it would be necessary to divide a thick muscle, and after separating the costo-coracoid membrane the artery would be exposed at the bottom of a more or less ideep space, with the cephalic and axillary veins in such relation with it as must render the n« ^ ? ^^ir'^ °^ "'''^^ particularly hazardous.

Running forwards and inwards along the upper border of the Pectoralis minor, it passes between it and the Pectoralis major to the side of the chest. It supplies these muscles, and the parietes of the thorax, anastomosing with the internal mammary and mter- costal arteries. The acromial thoracic is a short trunk, which arises from the fore part ot the axillary artery. Projecting forwards to the upper border of the Pectoralis minor, it divides into three sets of branches, thoracic, acromial, and descending. The thoracic branches, two or three in number, are distributed to the Serratus magnus and Pectoral muscles, anastomosing with the intercostal branches of the internal mammary. The acromial branches are directed outwards towards the acromion, supplying the Deltoid muscle, and anastomosing, on the surface of the acromion, with the suprascapular and posterior circumflex arteries. The descending branca passes in the interspace between the PectoraHs major and Deltoid, accompanying the cephalic vein, and supplying both muscles. i i j p The long thoracic passes downwards and inwards along the lower border ot the Pectoralis minor to the side of the chest, supplying the Serratus magnus the Pectoral muscles, and mammary gland, and sending branches across the axiUa to the axillary glands and Subscapularis, which anastomose with the internal mammary and intercostal arteries. , The thoracica alaris is a small branch, which supplies the glands and areolar tissue of the axilla. Its place is frequently supplied by branches from some ot the other thoracic arteries. . -i. ai „ The subscapular, the largest branch of the axillary artery, arises opposite the lower border of the Subscapularis muscle, and passes downwards and backwards along its lower margin to the inferior angle of the scapula, where it anastomoses with the posterior scapular, a branch of the subclavian. It distributes branches to the Subscapularis, Serratus magnus, Teres major, and Latissimus doi^i niuscle^ and gives off, about an inch and a-half from its origin, a large branch, the dorsaiis scapute, which curves round the inferior border of the scapula, leaving the axilla in the interspace between the Teres minor above, the Teres major J^low, and the long head of the Triceps in front. Three branches, or sets of branches arise from the dorsaHs scapute: the first enters the subscapular fossa, beneath the buD- scapularis, which it supplies, anastomosing with the posterior scapular and supra- scapular arteries; the second, the trunk of the artery {dorsaiis scapulae) inrns round the axillary border of the scapula, and enters the infraspmous fossa, wbere it anastomoses with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries ; and a tm , or median branch, is continued along the axillary border of the scapula, betwee the Teres major and minor, and, at the dorsal surface of the mferior angle ot bone, anastomoses with the posterior spapular. ,„,/^„-nr ctr- The circumflex arteries wind round the neck of the humerus.

(Fig. 218.) The Brachial Artery commences at the lower margin of the tendon of the Teres major, and passing down the inner and anterior aspect of the arm, terminates about hali an inch below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. The direction of this vessel is marked by a line drawn from the outer side of the axillaiy space between the folds of the axilla, to a point midway between the con- dyles of the humerus, which cor- responds to the depression along the inner border of the Coraco- brachialis and Biceps muscles. In the upper part of its course, the artery lies internal to the humerus ; but below, it is in front of that bone. Ilelatio7is. This artery is super- ficial throughout its entire extent, being covered, in front, by the in- tegument, the superficial and deep fascia ; the bicipital fascia separates it opposite the elbow from the me- dian basilic vein ; the median nerve crosses it at its middle ; and the basilic vein lies in the line of the artery, but separated from it by the fascia, in the lower half of its coui^se.

At the bend of tlie elbow, the brachial artery sinks deeply into a triangular interval, the base of which is directed upwards towards the humerus, and the sides of which are bounded, externally, by the Supinator longus, internally, by the Pronator radii teres ; its floor is formed by the Brachialis anticus and Supinator brevis. This space contains the brachial artery, with its accompanying veins; the radial and ulnar arteries ; the median and musculo-spiral nerves ; and the tendon of the Biceps. Tho brachial artery occupies the middle Line of this space, and divides opposite the coronoid process of the ulna into the radial and ulnar arteries ; it is covered, m front, by the integument, the superficial fascia, and the median basilic vein, the vein being separated from direct contact with the artery by the bicipital fascia. Behind, it lies on the Brachialis anticus, which separates it fi-om the elbow-joint. The median nerve lies on the inner side of the artery, but sepa- rated from it below by an interval of half an incli. The tendon of the Biceps lies to the outer side of the space, and the musculo-spiral nerve stiU more externally lying upon the Supinator brevis, and partly concealed by the Supinator longus. Pemliarities of the Arteiy as regards its Course. The brachial artery, accompanied by the median nerve, may leave the inner border of the Biceps, and descend towards the inner condyle of the humerus, where it usually curves round a prominence of bone, to which it is connected by a fibrous band; it then inclines outwards, beneath or through the substance of the Pronator teres muscle, to the bend of the elbow. The variation bears considerable analogy with the normal condition of the artery in some of the carnivora: it has been referred to, above, in the description of the humerus. As regards its Division. Occasionally, the artery is divided for a short distance at its upper pai-t into two trunks, which are united above and below. A similar pecuharity occurs in the main vessel of the lower limb. The point of bifurcation may be above or below the usual point, the tormer conaiiion beinff by far the most frequent. Out of 481 examinations recorded by Mr. Quain some made on the right, and some on the left side of the body, in 386 the artery bifurcated in its normal position. In one case only was the place of division lower than usual, being two or three inches below the elbow-joint. ' In 94 cases out of 481, or about one in 55, there were two arteries instead of one in'some part, or in the whole of the ami.' _ , . There appears, however, to be no correspondence between the arteries ot the two arras, with respect to their irregular division ; for in sixty-one bodies it occurred on one side on y in forty-three ; on both sides, in diflerent positions, in thirteen ; on both sides, m the siuue ^°^The'point''of bifurcation takes place at different parts of the arm, being most ^eq^"/'° the upper part, leas so in tho lower part, and least so in the middle, tho most usual point lorSURGICAL ANATOMY OF BRACHIAL ARTERY. 375 1 „p *iiQao f>irf iimatauces, two lar^e arteries would be the application of . a li,ature ,; ^-^er any of th^^^^^^^ ^^^^^ found in the armmsteadot one arises from the inner side of liarities is the high division of the 1; J^^!'^^^^^^ to the elbow, where it crosses it, lying tl>e brachial, and rnns parallel ^^^h the ' ^ t unic to artery immediately Ijeneath the fascia; or it may perforate the lascia, uuu i> beneath the integument. hio-li up, and then occasionally leaves that The ulnar sometimes arises from the brachial ^'n^ uP' ; condyle.

These vessels usually join Vmt'ties in Mcscnl^ delations.* The brachial artery is occasionally concealed so^^f P^^J of its course, by muscular or tendinous slips derived from various sources. In the upper third of the arm, the brachial vessels and median nerve have been seen concealed to the extent of three inches, by a muscular layer of considerable thickness, derived from the <j-oi'aco- brachiaUs, which passed round to the inner side of the vessel, and joined the internal head ot the Triceps In the lower half of the arm the artery is occasionally concealed by a broad thin head to the Biceps muscle. A narrow fleshy slip from the Biceps has been seen to cross the artery, concealmg it for an inch and a half, its tendon ending in the aponeurosis coverino- the Pronator teres. A muscular and tendinous slip has been seen to arise from the external bicipital ridge by a long tendon, cross obliquely behind the long tendon of the Biceps, and end in a fleshy belly, which appears on the inner side of the arm between the Biceps and Coraco-brachialis, passes down along the inner edge of tb.e former, and crosses the artery very obliquely, so as to lie in front of it for three inches, and, finally, gives rise to a narrow flattened tendon, which is inserted into the aponeurosis over the Pronator teres. A tendinous slip, arising from the deep part of the tendon of the Pectoralis major, has been seen to cross the artery obliquely at or below the Coraco-brachialis, and join the intermuscular septum above the inner condyle. The Brachialis anticus not unfrequently projects at the outer side of the artery, and occasionally overlaps it, sending inwards, across the artery, an aponeurosis which binds the vessel down upon the Brachialis anticus. Sometimes, a fleshy slip from the muscle covers the vessel, in one case to the extent of three inches. In some cases of high origin of the Pronator teres, an aponeurosis extends from it to join the Brachialis anticus external to the artery ; a kind of arch being thus formed under which the principal artery and median nerve pass, so as to be concealed for half an inch above the transverse level of the condyle. Surgical Anatomij. Compression of the brachial artery is required in cases of amputation and some other operations in the arm and forearm; and it will be observed, that it may be effected in almost any part of the course of the artery. If pressure is made in the upper part of the limb, it should be directed from within outwards, and if in the lower part, from before backwards, as the artery lies on the inner side of the humerus above, and in front of it below. The most favourable situation is near the insertion of the Coraco- brachialis. The application of a ligature to the brachial artery may be required in cases of wounds of the vessel, and in some cases of wound of the palmar arch. It is also sometimes necessary in cases of aneurism of the brachial, the radial, ulnar, or interosseous arteries. The artery may be secured in any part of its course. The chief guides in determining its position are the surface-markings produced by the inner margin of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps, the known course of the vessel, and its pulsation, which should be carefully felt for before any operation is performed, as the vessel occasionally deviates from its usual position in the arm. In what- ever situation the operation is performed, great care is necessary, on account of the extreme thinness of the parts covering the artery, and the intimate connection which the vessel has throughout its whole course with important nerves and veins. Sometimes a thin layer of muscular fibre is met -svith concealing the artery ; if such is the case, it must be cut across, in order to expose the vessel. In the upper third of the arm the artery may be exposed in the following manner:—The patient being placed horizontally upon a table, the affected limb should be raised from the Hide, and the hand supinated. An incision about two inches in length should be made on the ulnar side of the Coraco-brachialis muscle, and the subjacent fascia cautiously divided, so as * See SxBUTHERs's Anatomical and Fhrjsiohgical Observations.ARTERIES. 376 to avoid woiindinf!^ tlio intornnl ciitanoous nervo or basilic vein, which sonieliiuea run on tbo surface of tho artery na liigh as the axilla. The I'ascia having been divided, it should bo remembered, that tho ulnar and inttirnal cutaneous nerves lie on the inner side of the artery, the median on tlio outer side, the latter nerve being occasionally superficial to the artery in this situation, and that tlie vento coinitea are also in relation with the vessel, one on either side. These being carefully separated, tho aneurism needle should be passed round the artery from the ulnar to the radial side. If two arteries are present in the nrm, in consequence of a high division, they are iisually placed side by side; and if they are exposed in an operation, the surgeon should endeavour to ascertain, by alternately pressing on each vessel, which of the two commu- nicates with tho wound or aneurism, when a ligature may be applied accordingly; or if pulsation or hitsmorrhage ceases only when both vessels are compressed, both vessels may be tied, as it may be concluded that the two communicate above tlio seat of disease, or are reunited. It should also be remembered, that two arteries may be present in the arm in a case of high division, and that one of these may be found along the inner intermuscular septum, in a line towards the inner condyle of the humerus, or in the usual position of the brachial, but deeply placed beneath the common trunk: a knowledge of these facts will suggest tbe precautions necessary in every case, and indicate the measures to be adopted when anomalies are met with. In the middle of the arm the brachial artery may be exposed by making an incision along the inner margin of the Biceps muscle. The forearm being bent so as to relax tlie mu.scle, it should be drawn slightly aside, and the fascia being carefully divided, the median nerve will be exposed lying upon the artery (sometimes beneath) ; this being drawn inwards and the muscle outwards, the artery should be separated from its accompanying veins and secured. In this situation the inferior profunda may be mistaken for the main trunk, especially if enlarged, from the collateral circulation having become established; this may be avoided by directing the incision externally towards the Biceps rather than inwards or backwards towards the Triceps. The loioer part of the brachial artery is of extreme interest in a surgical point of view, an accoimt of the relation which it bears to tlie veins most commonly opened in venesection. Of these vessels, the median basilic is the largest and most prominent, and, consequently, the one usually selected for the operation. It should be remembered, that this vein runs parallel with the brachial artery, from which it is separated by the bicipital fascia, and that in no case should this vessel be selected for venesection, except in a part which is not in contact with the artery. Collateral Cirmlation. After the application of a ligature to the brachial artery in the upper third of the arm, the circulation is carried on by branches from the circumflex and subscapular arteries, anatomosing with ascending branches from the superior profunda. If the brachial is tied heloiu the origin of the profunda arteries the circulation is maintained by the branches of the profundre, anastomosing with the recurrent radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries. In two cases described by Mr. South,* in which the brachial artery had been tied some time previously, in one ' a long portion of the artery had been obliterated, and sets of vessels are descending on either side from above the obliteration, to be received into others which ascend in a similar manner from below it. In the other, the obliteration is less exten- sive, and a single curved artery about as big as a crow-quill passes from the upper to the lower open part of the artery.' The branches of the brachial artery are the Superior profunda. Inferior profunda. Nutrient artery. Anastomofcica magna. Muscular. The superior profimda arises from the inner and back part of the brachial, oppo- site the lower border of the Teres major, and passes backwards to the interval between the outer and inner heads of the Triceps muscle, accompanied by the musculo-spiral nerve ; it winds round the back part of the shaft of the humerus in the spiral groove, between the Triceps and the bone, and descends^ on the outer side of the arm to the space between the Brachialis anticus and Supinator longus, as far as the elbow, where it anastomoses with the recurrent branch of the radial artery. It supplies the Deltoid, Coraco-brachialis, and Triceps muscles, and whilst in the groove between the Triceps and the bone, it gives off the posterior articular artery, which descends perpendicularly between the Triceps and the bone, to the * Chelius' Surgery,, vol. ii. p. 254.

The .udrierd artery of the shaft of tlie humerus anses from the brachial, about t he middle of the arm. Passing downwards, it enters the nutrient canal of that bone, near tho insertion of the Coraco-brachialis muscle. r<.i 1 1 fi. The inferior profunda, of small size, arises from the brachial, a little below the nuddle of the arm; piercing the internal intermuscular soptum it descends on the surface of the inner head of the Triceps muscle, to the space between the inner condyle and olecranon, accompanied by the ulnar nerve, and terminates by ana- stomosing with the posterior ulnar recurrent, and anastomotica magna, it a so supplies a branch to the front of the internal condyle, which anastomoses with the anterior upper recurrent. i, i +1, The anastomotica viagna arises from the brachial, about two inches above the elbow-joint. It passes transversely inwards upon the Brachialis anticus, and piercing the internal intermuscular septum, winds round tho back part of the humerus between the Triceps and the bone, forming an arch above the olecranon fossa, by its junction with the posterior articular branch of the superior profunda. As this vessel lies on the Brachialis anticus, an offset passes between the internal condyle and olecranon, which anastomoses with the inferior profunda and posterior ulnar recurrent, arteries. Other branches ascend to join the inferior profunda ; and some descend in front of the inner condyle, to anastomose with the anterior ulnar recurrent. The muscular are three or four large branches, which are distributed to the muscles in the course of the artery. They supply the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps and Brachialis anticus muscles. The Anastomosis around tJie Elhoio-Joint (fig. 221). The vessels engaged in this • anastomosis may be conveniently divided into those situated in front and beJiind the Internal and External Condyles. The branches anastomosing m/roni of the In- ternal Condyle are :—The anastomotica magna, the anterior ulnar recurrent and the anterior terminal branch of the inferior profunda. Those behind the Internal Condyle are :—The anastomotica magna, the posterior ulnar recuiTent and the pos- terior terminal branch of the inferior profunda. The branches anastomosing in front of the External Condyle are :—The radial recurrent and the termination of the superior profunda. Those behind the External Condyle (perhaps more pr®- perly described as being situated between the external condyle and the olecranon) are:—The anastomotica magna, the interosseous recurrent and the posterior articular branch of the superior profunda. There is also a large arch of ana- stomosis above the olecranon formed by the interosseous recurrent, joining with the anastomotica magna and posterior nlnar recurrent (fig. 221). From this description it will be observed that the anastomotica magna is the vessel most engaged, the only part of the anastomosis in which it is not employed being that in front of the external condyle. Eadial Aetert. The Eadial Artery appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of the brachial, but, in size, it is smaller than the ulnar. It commences at the bifurca- tion of the brachial, just below the bend of the elbow, and passes along the radial Bide of the forearm to the wrist; it then winds backwards, round the outer side of the carpus, beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb, and, finally, passes for- wards between the two heads of the first Dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand, where it crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar border of the hand, to form the deep palmar arch. At its termination, it inosculates ■with the deep branch of the ulnar artery. The relations of this vessel may thus be conve- niently divided into three parts, viz., in the forearm, at the back of the wrist, and m the hand. ' lielations.

It is superficial throughout its entire extent, being covered by the integument, the superlicial and deep fascia, and slightly overlapped above by the Supinator longus. In its course downwards, it lies upon the tendon of the Biceps, the Supinator brevis, the Pronator radii teres, tho radial origin of the Flexor sublimis digitorum, the Flexor longus pollicis, the Pronator quadratus, and the lower extremity of the radius. In the upper third of its course, it lies between the Supinator longus and the Pronator radii teres ; in its lower two-thirds, between tho tendons of the Supinator longus and the Flexor carpi radialis. The radial nerve lies along the outer side of the artery, in the middle third of its course; and some filaments of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, after piercing the deep fascia, run along the lower part of the artery as it ■winds round the wrist. The vessel is accompanied by vena3 comites throughout its whole course. Plan of the Relations of the Radial Artery in the Forearm. Infrmt. Integument—superficial and deep fasciae. Supinator longus.

At the turist, as it winds round the outer side of the carpns, from the styloid process to tbe first interosseous space, it lies upon the external lateral ligament, being covered by the extensor tendons of the tbumb, subcutaneous veins, some filaments of the radial nerve, and the integument. It is accompanied by two veins, and a filament of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. In the hand, it passes from the upper end of the first interosseous space, between the heads of the Abductor indicis or first Dorsal interosseous muscle transversely across the palm, to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, where it inosculates with, the communicating branch from the ulnar artery, forming the deep palmar arch. It lies upon the carpal extremities of the metacai-pal bones and the Interossei muscles, being covered by the flexor tendons of the fingers, the Lumbricales, the muscles of the little finger, and the Flexor brevis pollicis, and is accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Feculiarities. The origin of the radial artery varies in the proportion nearly of one in eight cases. In one case the origin was lower than usual. In the other cases, tlie upper part of the brachial was a more frequent source of origin than the axillary. The varia- tions in the position of this vessel in the arm, and at the bend of the elbow, have been already mentioned. In the forearm it deviates less frequently from its position than the ulnar. It has been found lying over the fascia, instead of beneath it. It has also beon observed on tho surface of the Supinator longus, instead of along its inner border: and m turning round the wrist, it has been seen lying over, instead of beneath, the Extensor tendons. Surnical Anatomy. The operation of tying the radial artery is required in cases of wounds either of its trunk, or of some of its branches, or for aneurism : and it will bo observed, that the vessel may be easily exposed in any part of its course through the forearm. _ Ihe opera- tion in the middle or inferior third of the forearm is easily performed; but in the upper third near the elbow, it is attended with some dilHculty, from the greater depth of the vessel, and from its being overlapped by tho Supinator longus aud Pronator teres muscles.BRANCHES OF RADIAL. 379 • r.^r. tiii-ril nn incision three inclies in length should be made ■ To tie the artery m the "PPer «iird, an ^^^1^ downwards and outwards, on through the integument, from ^^'"^f"^;'^.f'l^'Ses of the median vein; the fascia of the the radial side of the forearm, avoidmg bian^nej^j ^ little outwards, the artery wiU arm being divided, and the Supinator longus be exposed.

In this situation, the radial nerve lies in close relation with the outer side of the artery, and should, as well as the veins, bo carefully avoided. In the lower third, the artery is easily secured by dividing the integument and I'ascias in the interval between the tendons of the Supinator longus and Flexor carpi radialis muscles. The branches of the radial artery may be divided into three groups, corresponding with the three regions in which the vessel is situated. {Radial recurrent. Muscular. Superficialis volas.

From the arch thus formed, branches descend to supply the ar- ticulations of the wrist. The posterior carpal is a small vessel which arises from the radial artery beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb ; crossing the carpus transversely to the inner border of the hand, it anastomoses with the posterior carpal branch of the tilnar. It sends branches upwards, which anastomose with the termination of the anterior interosseous artery; other branches descend to the meta- carpal spaces ; they are the dorsal interosseous arteries for the third and fourth interosseous spaces; they anastomose with the posterior per- forating branches from the deep palmar arch.

The Ulnar Arterij, the larger of the two subdivisions of the brachial, commences a little below the ioend of the elbow, and crosses the inner side of the forearm obliquely inwards, to the commencement of its lower half; it then runs along its ulnar border to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone, and passes across the palm of the hand, forming the superficial palmar arch, which sometimes terminates by inosculating with the superficialis ^°^^B6latio7is in the Forearm. In its upper half, it is deeply seated, being covered by all the superficial Flexor muscles, excepting the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; it is crossed by the median nerve, which lies to its inner side for about an inch, and it lies upon the Brachialis anticus and Flexor profundus digitorum muscles. In the loioer half of the forearm, it Hes upon the Flexor profundus, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fasciae, and is placed between the Flexor carpi ulnaris and Flexor sublimis digitorum muscles. It is accompanied by two vense comites ; the ulnar nerve lies on its inner side for the lower two-thirds of its extent, and a small branch from the nerve descends on the lower part of the vessel to the palm of the hand.

At the wrist (fig. 219), the ulnar artery is covered by the integument and fascia, and lies upon the anterior annular ligament. On its inner side is the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve lies at the inner side, and somewhat behind the artery. Li the 2jalm of the hand, the continuation of the ulnar artery is called the superficial palmar arch ; it passes obliquely outwards to tho interspace betweenARTEllIES. 382 the ball of the thumb and tlio index finger, where it occasionally anastomoses with tho supcrficialis volro, and a branch from the radialis iudicis, thus completing the arch. Tho convexity of this ai-ch is directed towards the fingers, its concavity towards the muscles of tho thumb. If the thumb be put at right angles to the hand, the position of the superficial palmar arch will bo roughly indicated by a hue drawn along tho lower margin of tho tlaumb across the palm of the hand : the deep palmar arch is situated about a finger's breadth nearer to tho carpus. The superficial palmar arch is covered by the Pahnaris brevis, the palmar fascia, and integument; and lies upon the annular ligament, the muscles of the little finger, the tendons of the superficial flexor, and the divisions of the median and ulnar nerves, the latter accompanying the artery a short part of its course.

The ulnar artery has been found to vary in its origin nearly in the propor- tion of one in thirteen cases, in one case arising lower than usual, about two or three inches below the elbow, and in all the other cases much higher, the brachial being a more frequent source of origin than the axillary. Variations in the position of this vessel are more frequent than in the radial. "When its origin is normal, the course of the vessel is rarely changed. When it arises high up, it is almost invariably superficial to the Flexor muscles in the forearm, lying commonly beneath the fascia, more rarely between the fascia and integument. In a few cases, its position was subcutaneous in the upper part of the forearm, subaponeurotic in the lower part. Surgical Anatomy. The application of a figature to this vessel is required in cases of wound of the artery, or of its branches, or in consequence of aneurism. In the upper half of the forearm, the artery is deeply seated beneath the superficial Flexor muscles, and their division would be requisite in a case of recent wound of the artery in this situation, in order to secure it, but under no other circumstances. In the middle and lower thhd of the fore- arm, this vessel may be easily secured by making an incision on the radial side of the tendon of the Flexor carpi ulnaris : the deep fascia being divided, and the Flexor cai-pi ulnaris and its companion muscle, the Flexor subhmis, being separated from each other, the vessel wiU be exposed, accompanied by its venae eomites, the ulnar nerve lying on its inner side. The veins being separated from the artery, the ligatm-e should be passed from the ulnar to the radial side, taking care to avoid the ulnar nerve. The branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged in the following groups :— f Anterior ulnar recurrent. I Posterior ulnar recurrent. Forearm.-i , f Anterior interosseous.

The posterior ulnar recurrent is much larger, and arises somewhat lower than the preceding.

The interosseous artery (fig. 220) is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of considerable size, which arises immediately below the tuberosity of the radius, and, passing back- wards to the upper border of the interosseous mem- brane, divides into two branches, the anterior and posterior interosseous. The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on tbe anterior surface of the interosseous mem- brane, to whicb it is con- nected by a thin aponeur- otic arch. It is accom- panied by the interosseous branch of the median nerve, and overlapped by tbe con- tiguous margins of the Flexor profundus digito- rum and Flexor longus pollicis muscles, giving off in this situation muscular branches, and the nutrient arteries of the radius and Voaterwr Cnrpt ( Vlnar^ I 7ernii titttton of \A. n terioi'lnlerosffeo tt s FostP.r/or Cai'UctZ (JiaJinJ ) orxni/.v Ptilliei.

At the upper border of the Pronator quadratus, a branch descends in front of that muscle, to anasto- mose in front of the carpus with branches from the anterior carpal and deep palmar arch. The continu- ation of the artery passes behind the Pronator quad- ratus (fig. 221), and, piei'c- ing the interosseous mem- brane, descends to the back of the wrist, where it an- astomoses with the poste- rior interosseous and the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. The anterior interosseous gives off a long, slender branch, which accompanies the median nerve, and gives offsets to its substance. This, the median artery, is some- times much enlarged. Thejposfenor interosseous artery passes backwards through the interval between384 ARTEllIBS. the oblique ligament and the upper border of the interosseous membrane, and runs down the back part of the forearm, between the superficial and deep layer of muscles, to both of which it distributes branches. Descending to the back of the wrist, it anastomoses with the termination of the anterior interosseous, and with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. This ai-teiy gives off, near its origin, the interosseous recurrent branch, a large vessel, which ascends to the interval between the external condyle and olecranon, beneath the Anconeus and Supinator brevis, anastomosing with a branch from the superior profunda, and with the posterior ulnar recurrent, and anastomotica magna. The vmscular branches are distributed to the muscles along the ulnar side of the forearm. The carpal hrancJies are intended for the supply of the wrist-joint. The anterior carpal is a small vessel which crosses the front of the carpus, beneath the tendons of the Flexor profundus, and inosculates with a corresponding branch of the radial artery. The posterior carpal arises immediately above the pisiform bone, winding back- wards beneath the tendon of the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; it gives off a branch which passes across the dorsal surface of the carpus beneath the extensor tendons, anasto- mosing with a corresponding branch of the radial artery, and forming the posterior carpal arch; it is then continued along the metacarpal bone of the little finger, forming its dorsal branch. The deep or communicating branch (fig. 220), arises at the commencement of the palmar arch, and passes deeply inwards between the Abductor minimi digiti and Flexor brevis minimi digiti, near their origins ; it anastomoses with the termina- tion of the radial artery, completing the deep palmar arch. The digital branches (fig. 219), four in number, are given off from the convexity of the superficial palmar arch. They supply the ulnar side of the little finger, and the adjoining sides of the little, ring, middle, and index fingers ; the radial side of the index finger and thumb being supplied from the radial artery. The digital arteries at first lie superficial to the flexor tendons, but as they pass forwards with the digital nerves to the clefts between the fingers, they He between them, and are there joined by the interosseous branches from the deep palmar arch. The digital arteries on the sides of the fingers Ue beneath the digital nerves ; and, about the middle of the last phalanx, the two branches for each finger form an arch, fi-om the convexity of which branches pass to supply the matrix of the nail. The Descending Aorta. The Descending Aorta is divided into two portions, the thoracic, and abdominal, in correspondence with the two great cavities of the trunk in which it is \he Thoracic ylorto. commences at the lower border of the fourth dorsal ver- tebra, on the left side, and terminates at the aortic opening in the Diaphragm m front'of the last dorsal vertebra. At its commencement, it is situated on the left side of the spine ; it approaches the median Hne as it descends; and, at its termi- nation, Hes directly in front of the column. The direction of this vessel bemg influenced by the spine, npon which it rests, it describes a curve which is concave forwards in the dorsal region. As the branches given off from it arc small, the diminution in the size of the vessel is inconsiderable. It is contamed in the back part of the posterior mediastinum, being in relation, m front, from abo^e downwards, with the left puhnonary artery, the left bronchus the pericardium, ,and the CBSophagus; behind, with the vertebral column, and the vena azygos iminor ■ on the right side, with the vena azygos major, and thoracic duct; on tJie ieft side, with the left pleura and lung.

The student should now consider the effects likely to be produced by aneurism of the thoracic aorta, a disease of common occurrence. When we consider the great depth of the vessel from the surface, and the number of important structures which surround it on every side, it may be easily conceived what a variety of obscure symptoms may arise from disease of this part of the arterial system, and how they may be liable to be mistaken for those of other affections. Aneurism of the thoracic aorta most usually extends backwards, along the left side of the spine, producing absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, with curvature of the spine; wliilst the irritation or pressure on the cord, will give rise to pain, either in the chest, back, or loins, with radiating pain in the left upper inter- costal spaces, from pressure on the intercostal nerves; at the same time the tumour may project backwards on each side of the spine, beneath the integument, as a pulsating swelling, simulating abscess connected with diseased bone; or it may displace the oesophagus, and compress the lung on one or the other side. If the tumour extend forward, it may press upon and displace the heart, giving rise to palpitation and other symptoms of disease of that organ; or it may displace, or even compress, the oesophagus, causing pain and difficulty of swallowing, as in stricture of that tube, and ultimately even open into it by ulceration, producing fatal hsemorrhage. If the disease make way to either side, it may press upon the thoracic duct; or it may burst into the pleural cavity, or into the trachea or lung; and lastly, it may open into the posterior mediastinum. The aorta is, comparatively often, found to be obliterated at a particular spot, viz., at the junction of the arch with the thoracic aorta, just below the ductus arteriosus. Whether this is the result of disease, or of congenital malformation, is immaterial to our present purpose; it affords an interesting opportunity of observing the resources of the collateral circulation. The course of the anastomosing vessels, by which the blood is brought from the upper to the lower part of the artery, will be found well described iu an account of two cases in the Pathological Transactions, \o\a. viii. and x. In the former (p. 162), Mr. Sydney Jones thus sums up the detailed description of the anastomosing vessels. ' The principal communications by which the circulation was carried on, were—Firstly, the internal mammary, anastomos- ing with the intercostal ai-teries, with the phrenic of the abdominal aorta by means of the musculo-phrenic and comes nervi phrenici, and largely with the deep epigastric. Secondly, the superior intercostal, anastomosing anteriorly by means of a large branch with the first aortic intercostal, and posteriorly, with the posterior branch of the same artery. Thirdly, the inferior thyroid, by means of a branch about the size of an ordinary radial, formed a commu- nication with the first aortic intercostal. Fourthly, the transversalis colli, by means of very large communications with the posterior branches of the intercostals. Fifthly, the branches (of the subclavian axiUary) gomg to the side of the chest were large and anastomosed freely with the lateral branches of the intercostals.' In the second case also (vol. x. p. 97) Mr. Wood describes the anastomoses in a somewhat similar manner, adding the remark, that the blood which was brought into the aorta through the anastomoses of the intercostal arteries, appeared to be expended principally in supplying the abdomen and pelvis; while the supply to the lower extremities had passed through the internal mammary and epigkstries.' Branches of the Thoracic Aorta. Pericardiac. CEsophageal. Intercostal. Bronchial. Posterior mediastinal. The pericardiac are a few small vessels, irregular in their origin, distributed to the pericardium, C C386 ARTERIES. The IroncUal arteries are tlie nutrient vessels of the lungs, and vary in numher, size, and orio-in. That of the right side arises from the first aortic intercostal, or by a common trunk with the loft bronchial, from the front of the thoracic aorta. Those of the left side, usually two in number, aiise from the thoracic aorta, one a little lower than the other. Each vessel is directed to the back part of the corresponding bronchus, along which they run, dividing and subdividing upon the bronchial tubes, supplying them, the cellular tissue of the lungs, the bronchial glands, and the oesophagus. The oesophageal arteries, usually four or five in number, arise from the front of the aorta, and pass obliquely downwards to the ossophagus, forming a chain of anastomoses along that tube, anastomosing with the oesophageal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries above, and with ascending branches from the phrenic and gastric arteries below. The posterior mediastinal arteries are numerous small vessels which supply the glands and loose areolar tissue in the mediastinum. The Intercostal arteries arise from the back part of the aorta. They are usually ten in number on each side, the superior intercostal space (and occasionally the second one) being supplied by the superior intercostal, a branch of the subclavian. The rigbt intercostals are longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta on the left side of the spine ; they pass outwards, across the bodies of the vertebrae, to the intercostal spaces, being covered by the pleura, the cesophaguB, thoracic duct, sympathetic nerve, and the vena azygos major; the left passing beneath the superior intercostal vein, the vena azygos minor, and sympathetic. In the intercostal spaces, each artery divides into two branches : an anterior, or proper intercostal branch ; and a posterior, or dorsal branch. The anterior branch passes outwards, at first lying upon the External inter- costal muscle, covered in front by the pleura and a thin fascia. It then passes between the two layers of Intercostal muscles, and, having ascended obliquely to the lower border of tbe rib above, divides, near the angle of that bone, into two branches ; of these the larger runs in the groove, on the lower border of the rib above ; the smaUer branch along the upper border of the rib below ; passmg forward, they supply the Intercostal muscles, and anastomose with the anterior intercostal branches of the internal mammary, and with the thoracic branches of the axillary artery. The first aortic intercostal anastomoses with the superior intercostal, and the last three pass between the abdominal muscles, inosculatmg with the epigastric in front, and with the phrenic, and lumbar arteries. Each intercostal artery is accompanied by a vein and nerve, the former being above, and the latter below, except in the upper intercostal spaces, where the nerve is at first above the artery. The arteries are protected from pressure during the action of the Intercostal muscles, by fibrous arches thrown across, and attached by e^h extremity to the bone. a n The posterior or dorsal Iranch, of each intercostal artery, passes backwards to tlie inner side of the anterior costo-transverse hgament, and divides into a spmal branch, which supplies the vertebrae, the spinal cord and its membranes, and a muscular branch, which is distributed to the nrascles and integument of the back. The Abdominal Aorta. (Fig. 222.) The Abdominal Aorta commences at the aortic opening of the Diaphragm, m front of the body of the last dorsal vertebra, and, descending a httle to the lett side of the vertebral column, terminates on the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, commonly a little to the left of the middle line,* where it divides into thetwo coni. mon iliac arteries.

Aneurisms of the abdominal aorta near the cceliac axis communicate in neaiiy equal proportion with the anterior and posterior parts of the artery. Wben an aneurismal sac is connected with the back part of the abdominal aorta, it usually produces absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, and forms a pulsating tumour, that presents itself in the left hypochondriac or epigastric _ regions accompanied by symptoms of disturbance of the alimentary canal. Pain is invariably present, and is usually of two kinds, a fixed and constant pain in the back, caused by the tumour pressing on or displacing the branches of the solar plexus and splanchnic nerves and a sharp lancinating pain, radiating along those branches of the lumbar nerves which are preyed on by the tumour ; henfe the°pain in the loins, the testes, the bypogastrium, and m the lower hmb rusuaUy of the left side). This form of aneurism usuaUy bursts into the peritoneal cavity or behind the peritoneum, in the left hypochondriac region ; or it may form a large aneSsmal sac, extending down as low as Poupart-s ligament; hemorrhage m these ca^es bein<^ generally very extensive, but slowly produced, and not rapidly latal. mr an anemlsmal sac is connected with the front of the aorta near the ccelia^ ax^ it forms a pulsating tumour in the left hypochondriac or epigastric regions, usually attended withTymptoms of" disturbance of the alimentary canal, as sickness, dyspepsia, or consti- Stiom^rd accompanied by pain, which is constant but near y always W m the loi^, Sstrium, or some part of the abdomen; the radiating pain being rare, as the lumba neifes are'seldom implicated. This form of aneurism may burst into the peritoneal cavity or behind the peritoneum, between the layers of the mesentery, or, more rarely, into the duodenum ; it rarely extends backwards so as to affect the spine „„^„„.p The abdom nal aortl has been tied seveml times, and although none of.Jhe paUenta permaneX recovered, still, as one of them lived ,ia long as ten days, the possibility of the ?e eTblishment of the circulation may be considered to be proved.

To expose this ai-tery, raise the liver, draw down the stomach, and then tear through the layers of the lesser omentum. The Coeliac axis is a short thick trunk, about half an inch in length, which arises from the aorta, opposite the margin of the Diaphragm, and passing nearly horizontally forwards (in the erect posture), divides into three large branches, the gastric, hepatic, and splenic, occasionally giving off one of the phrenic arteries. Relations. It is covered by the lesser omentum. On the right side, it is in relation with the right semilunar ganglion, and the lobus Spigelii ; on the left side, with the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac end of the stomach. Below, it rests upon the upper border of the pancreas. The Gastric Aetert (Coronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes upwards and to the left side, to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, distributing branches to the oesophagus, which anastomose with the aortic oesophageal arteries; others supply the cardiac end of the stomach, inoscu- lating with branches of the splenic artery: it then passes from left to right, along the lesser curvature of the stomach to the pylorus, lying in its course between the layers of the lesser omentum, and giving branches to both surfaces of the organ : at its termination it anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. The Hepatic Aetert in the adult is intermediate in size between the gastric and splenic; in the foetus, it is the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis. It passes upwards to the right side, between the layers of the lesser omentum, and in front of the foramen of "Winslow, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, right and left, which supply the cor- responding lobes of that organ, accompanying the ramifications of the vena portce and hepatic duct. The hepatic artery, in its course along the right border of the lesser omentum, is in relation with the ductus communis choledocus and portal vein, the duct lying to the right of the artery, and the vena port^ behind. Its branches are the Pyloric. Gastro-duodenalis. I Gastro-epiploica dextra. I. Pancreatico-duodenalis superior. , Cystic.39° AIITJCIIIKS. Tho 'pylonc hrancli arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to tho • pyloric end of tho stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, , sujjplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric artery. The gastro-duodenalis (fig. 224) is a short but large branch, which descends 1 behind tho duodenum, near tho pylorus, and divides at tho lower border of the ■ stomach into two bi-anches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and the pancreatico- duodenalis. Previous to its division, it gives oft" two or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and pancreas. Tho gasiro-ejnploica dextra runs from right to left along the greater curvature of tho stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, anastomosing about the middle of the lower border of tho stomach with the gastro-epiploica sinistra from the splenic artery. This vessel gives off numerous branches, some of which ascend ' 223.—The Ooeliac Axis and its Branches, the Liver having been raised, and the Lesser Omentum removed. to supply both surfaces of the stomach, whilst others descend to supply the great omentum. The pancreatico-diwdenalis superior descends along the contiguous margins of the duodenum and pancreas. It supplies both these organs, and anastomoses with the inferior pancrcatico-duodenal branch of tho supei'ior mesenteric artery. In ulceration of the duodenum, which frequently occurs in connection with severe burns, this artery may be involved, and death may occur from haamorrhage into the intestinal canal. The cystic artery (fig. 223), usually a branch of tho right hepatic, passes upwards and forwards along tho neck of tho gall bladder, and divides into two branches,391 SPLENIC. ■L e o,,,.fano f,he other between it and the substance one of which ramifies on its free surface, tne otnei u ; oftheUver. _ , ^ f ^1,0 three branches of the The Splenic Aktery, - tlie adult ^l^J^'l^,,^^^, ,f it^ course.

The branches of this vessel are :— PancreaticBB parvse. Gastric (Vasa brevia). Pancreatica magna. Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The 'pancreatic are numerous small branches derived from the splenic as it runs behind the upper border of the pancreas, supplying its middle and left parts. One of these, larger than the rest, is given off from the splenic near the left extremity of the pancreas; it runs from left to right near the posterior surface of the gland, following the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called the pancreatica magna. These vessels anastomose with the pancreatic branches of the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. The gastric (vasa hrevia) consist of from five to seven small branches, which arise either from the termination of the splenic artery, or from its terminal392 ARTERIES. branches; and passing from left to right, between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, arc distributed to the gi-eat curvature of the stomach ; anastomosing "with branches of the gastric and gastro-epiploica sinistra arteries. The gastro-epiploica sinistra, the largest branch of the splenic, runs from left to right along the great curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum ; and anastomoses with the gastro-epiploica dextra. In its course it dis- tributes several branches to the stomach, which ascend upon both surfaces; others descend to supply the omentum. Superior Mesenteric Artery. (Fig. 225.) In order to expose this vessel, raise the great omentum and transverse colon, draw down the small intestines, and cut through the peritoneum where the transverse meso-colon and mesentery join: the artery will then be exposed, just as it issues from beneath the lower border of the pancreas. The Superior Mesenteric Artery supplies the whole length of the small intestine, except the first part of the duodenum; it also supplies the coecum, ascending and transverse colon ; it is a vessel of large size, arising from the fore part of the aorta, about a quarter of an inch below the coeliac axis ; being covered at its origin by the splenic vein and pancreas. It passes forwards, between the pancreas and transverse portion of the duodenum, crosses in front of this portion of the intestine, and descends between the layers of tho mesentery to the riglit iliac fossa, where it terminates, considerably diminished in size. In its course it forms an arch, the convexity of which is directed forwards and downwards to the left side, the concavity backwards and upwards to the right. It is accompanied by the superior mesenteric vein, and is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. Its branches are the Inferior pancreatico-duodenal. Ileo-colic.

The inferior pancreatico-duodenal is given off from the superior mesenteric behind the pancreas, and is distributed to the head of the pancreas, with the trans- verse and descending portions of the duodenum ; anastomosing with the pancreatico- duodenal artery. The vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric artery. They are usually from twelve to fifteen in number, and are disti-ibuted to the jejunnm and ileum. They run parallel with one another between the layers of the mesentery /, each vessel dividing into two branches, which unite with a similar branch on each side, forming a series of arches, the convexities of which ai-e directed towards the intestine. Erom this first set of arches branches arise, which again unite with similar branches from either side, and thus a second series of arches is formed ; and from these latter, a third, and a fourth, or even fifth series of arches are constituted, diminishing in size the nearer they approach the intes- tine. From the terminal arches numerous, small straight vessels arise which encircle the intestine, upon which they are distributed, ramifying thickly between its coats. The ileo-tolic artery is the lowest branch given off from the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery. It descends between the layers of the mesentery to the right iliac fossa, where it divides into two branches. Of these, the inferior one inosculates with the lowest branches of the vasa intestini tenuis, from the convexity of which branches proceed to supply the termination of the ileum, the coecum and appendix coeci, and the ileo-coecal valve. The superior division inosculates with the colica dextra, and supplies the commencement of the colon. The colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery, and passing beneath the peritoneum to the middle of the ascending colon, divides into two branches: a descending branch which inoscu-INFERIOR MBSBNTBRIC. 393 lateswith the ileo-coHc; aad an ascending brancli which anastomoses with the cSca media These benches form arches, from the convexity of which vessels Se disSld to the ascending colon.

The SUPKARENAL ARTERIES (fig. 222) are two small vessels which anse one on each side of the aorta, opposite ihe superior mesenteric artery. They pass oblique y upwards and outwards to the under surface of the suprarenal capsules, to which they are distributed, anastomosing with capsular branches from the phrenic and renal arteries. In the adult these arteries are of small size ; m the foetus they are as large as the renal arteries. The Renal Artekibs are two large trunks, which arise from the sides ot the aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. Each is directed out- wards, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The right is longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta ; it passes behind the inferior vena cava. The left is somewhat higher than the right. Pre^dously to entering the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches, which are distributed to its substance. At the' hilum, these branches lie between the renal vein and ureter, the vein being usually in front, the ureter behind. Each vessel gives off some small branches to the suprarenal capsules, the ureter, and the surrounding cellular membrane and muscles. The Spermatic Arteries are distributed to the testes in the male, and to the ovaria in the female. They are two slender vessels, of considerable length, which arise from the front of the aorta, a little below the renal arteries. Each artery passes obliquely outwards and dovrnwards, behind the peritoneum, crossing the ureter, and resting on the Psoas muscle, the right spermatic lying in front of the inferior vena cava, the left behind the sigmoid flexure of the colon. On reaching the margin of the pelvis, each vessel passes in front of the corresponding external ihac artery, and takes a different course in the two sexes. In the male, it is directed outwards, to the internal abdominal ring, and accom- panies the other constituents of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal to the testis, where it becomes tortuous, and divides into several branches, two or three of which accompany the vas deferens, and supply the epididymis, anastomos- ing with the artery of the vas deferens; others pierce the back part of the tunica albuginea, and supply the substance of the testis. In the female, the spermatic arteries (ovarian) are shorter than in the male, and do not pass out of the abdominal cavity. On arriving at the margins of the pelvis, each artery passes inwards, between the two laminee of the broad ligament of the uterus, to be distributed to the ovary. One or two small branches supply the Fallopian tube ; another passes on to the side of the uterus, and anastomoses with the uterine arteries. Other ofisets are continued along the round ligament, through the inguinal canal, to the integument of the labium and groin. At an early period of foetal life, when the testes lie by the side of the spine, below the kidneys, the spermatic arteries are short; but as these organs descend from the abdomen into the scrotum, the arteries become gradually lengthened. The Pheenic Arteries are two small vessels, which present much variety in their origin. They may arise separately from the front of the aorta, immediately below the cceliac axis, or by a common trunk, which may spring either from the aorta, or from the cceliac axis. Sometimes one is derived from the aorta, and the other from one of the renal arteries. In only one out of thirty-six cases examined did these arteries arise as two separate vessels from the aorta. They diverge from one another across the crura of the Diaphragm, and then pass obliquely upwards and outwards upon its under surface. The left phrenic passes behind the oeso- phagus, and runs forwards on the left side of the oesophageal opening. The right phrenic passes behind the liver and inferior vena cava, and ascends along the396 ARTERIES. right side of the aperture for transmitting that vein. Near the back part of the central tendon, each vessel divides into two branches. The internal branch rung forwards to the front of the thorax, supplying the Diaphragm, and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the musculo-phrenic, a branch of the intei'nal mammary. The external branch passes towards the side of the thorax, and inosculates with the intercostal arteries. The internal branch of the right phrenic gives off a few vessels to the inferior vena cava; and the left one some branches to the oesophagus. Each vessel also sends capsular branches to the supra- renal capsule of its own side. The spleen on the left side, and the liver on the right, also receive a few branches from these vessels. The Lumbar Autebies are analagous to the intercostal. They are usually four in number on each side, and arise from the back part of the aorta, nearly at right angles with that vessel. They pass outwards and backwards, around the sides of the body of the corresponding lumbar vertebra, behind the sympathetic nerve and the Psoas muscle ; those on the right side being covered by the inferior vena cava, and the two upper ones on each side by the crura of the Diaphragm. In the interval between the transverse processes of the vertebrte each artery divides into a dorsal and an abdominal branch. The dorsal branch gives oflP, immediately after its origin, a spinal branch, which enters the spinal canal; it then continues its course backwards, between the transverse processes, and is distributed to the muscles and integument of the back, anastomosing with, eacb other, and -with the posterior branches of the intercostal arteries. The spinal hrancli, besides supplying offsets which run along the nerves to the dura mater and cauda equina, anastomosing with the other spinal arteries, divides into two branches, one of which ascends on the posterior surface of the body of the vertebra above, and the other descends on the posterior surface of the body of the vertebra below, both vessels anastomosing with similar branches from neigh- bouring spinal arteries. The inosculations of these vessels on each side, throughout the whole length of the spine, form a series of arterial arches behind the bodies of the vertebrfB, which are connected with each other, and with a median longitudinal vessel, extending along the middle of the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebree, by transverse branches. From these vessels offsets are distributed to the periosteum and bones. The abdominal brandies pass outwards, behind the Quadratus lumborum, the lowest branch occasionally in front of that muscle, and, being continued between the abdominal muscles, anastomose with branches of the epigastric and internal mammary in front, the intercostals above, and those of the iUo-lumbar and circum- flex iliac, ieZoiy. The Middle Sacral Autebt is a small vessel, about the size of a crow-qmll, which arises from the back part of the aorta, just at its bifurcation. It descends upon the last lumbar vertebra, and along the middle Hue of the front of the sacrum, to the upper part of the coccyx, where it anastomoses with the lateral sacral arteries and terminates in a minute branch, which runs down to the situation of the body presently to be described as ' Luschka's gland.' From it, branches arise which run through the meso-rectum, to supply the posterior surface of the rectum. Other branches are given off" on each side, which anastomose with the lateral sacral arteries and send off small offsets which enter the anterior sacral foramina. Coccygeal Gland, or Luschha's Gland.-Lymg near the tip of the coccyx, in a small tendinous interval formed by the union of the Levator am muscles of either side, and just above the coccygeal attachment of the Sphincter ani, is a small conglobate body, about as large as a lentil or a pea, farst described by Luschka,* and named by him the coccygeal gland, but the real nature and uses of which are doubtful, nor does it seem at present certain that it always exists.

Mitchell Banks, reprinted m 1867 from the ' Glasgow Medical Journal.' Common Iltac Aetbeies. ' The abdominal aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries. The bifur- cation usually takes place on the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. This point corresponds to the left side of the umbilicus, and is on a level with a Une drawn from the highest point of one iliac crest to the other. The common iliac arteries are about two inches in length ; diverging fi-om the termi- nation of the aorta, they pass downwards and outwards to the margin of the pelvis, and divide opposite the intervertebral substance, between the last lunibar vertebra and the sacrum, into two branches, the external and internal iUac arteries: the former supplying the lower extremity; the latter, the viscera and parietes of the pelvis. The right covimon iliac is somewhat larger than the left, and passes more obliquely across the body of the last lumbar vertebra. In front of it are the peritoneum, the ileum, branches of the sympathetic nerve, and, at its point of division, the ureter. Behind, it is separated from the last lumbar vertebra by the two common iliac veins. On its outer side, it is in relation with the inferior vena cava, and right common iliac vein, above ; and the Psoas magnus muscle, below. The left common iliac is in relation, in front, with the peritoneum, branches of the sympathetic nerve, the rectum and superior haemorrhoidal artery ; and is crossed at its point of bifurcation by the nreter. The left common iliac vein lies partly on the inner side, and part beneath the artery ; on its outer side, the artery is in relation with the Psoas magnus. Branches.

In thirteen cases, the vessel bifurcated within half an inch above or below the level of the crest of the ilium ; more frequently below than above. _ The point of division is subject to great variety. In two-thirds of a laro'e number of cases it was between the last lumbar vertebra and the upper border of the sacrum"- being above that point in one case out of eight, and below it in one case out of six. The left common iliac artery divides lower down more frequently than the right. The relative length, also, of the two common iliac arteries varies. The right common iliac was the longer in sixty-three cases; the left, in fifty-two whilst they were both equal in fifty-three. The length of the arteries varied in five-sevenths of the cases examined, from an inch and a half to three inches; in about half of the remaining cases, the artery was longer; and in the other half, shorter; the minimum length being less than half an inch, the maximum four and a half inches. In one instance, the right common iliac was found wanting, the external and internal iliacs arising directly from the aorta. _ Svi-gical Anatomy. The application of a ligature to the common iliac artery may be re- quired on account of aneurism or haemorrhage, implicating the external or internal iliacs or on account of secondary haemorrhage after amputation of the thigh high up. It has been seen that the origin of this vessel corresponds to the left side of the umbilicus on a level with a line drawn from the highest point of one iliac crest to the opposite one, and its course to a line extending from the left side of the umbilicus downwards towards the middle of Poupart's ligament. The line of incision required in the first steps of an operation for securing this vessel, would materially depend upon the natm-e of the disease. If the suro-eon select the iliac region, a curved incision, about five inches in length, may be made, commenc- ing on the left side of the umbilicus, carried outwards towards the anterior superior iliac spine, and then along the upper boMer of Poupart's ligament, as far as its middle. But if the aneurismal tumour should extend high up in the abdomen, along the external iliac, it is better to select the side of the abdomen, approaching the artery from above, by making ^n incision from four to five inches in length, from about two inches above and to the left of the umbilicus, carried outwards in a curved direction towards the lumbar region, and terminating a little below the anterior superior iliac spine. The abdominal muscles (in either case) having been cautiously divided in succession, the transversalis fascia must be carefully cut through, and the peritoneum, together with the ureter, separated from the artery, ani pushed aside ; the sacro-iliac articulation must then be felt for, and upon it the vessel will be felt pulsating, and may be fully exposed in close connection with its accompanying vein. On the right side, both common iliac veins, as weU as the inferior vena cava, are in close connection with the artery, and must be carefully avoided. On the left side, the vein usually lies on the inner side, and behind the artery ; but it occasionally happens that the two common iliac veins are joined on the left instead of the right side, which would add much to the difficulty of an operation in such a case. The common iliac artery may be so $hort that danger may be apj)rehended from secondary hffimorrhage if a ligature is applied to it. It would be preferable, in such a case, to tie both the external and internal ibacs near their origin. Collateral Circulation. The principal agents in cai'rying on the collateral circulation after the application of a ligature to the common iliac, are, the anastomoses of the htemorrhoidal branches of the internal iliac, witli the superior haemorrhoidal from the inferior mesenteric ; the anastomoses of the uterine and ovarian arteries, and of the vesical arteries of oppositeINTERNAL ILIAC. 399 -.1 XI •AA^c QOPVfll arterv; of the epigastric, with the internal sides ; of the lateral sacral, with the ^"^J^^^l^^^^^^^^^^^ ilio-lumbar, with the last lumbar mammary, inferior intercostal and lumbar aperies , ^.^^ ^^^^^^ _ artery; of the obturator arterv, by means ot ts puDic , posterior branches site side, and with the internal epigastric; and ot tne ^uue , of the sacral arteries.

Internal iliac vein. '. Lumbo-sacral nerve. Pyriformis muscle. In the foetus, the internal iliac artery (hypogastric) is twice as large as the external iliac, and appears to be the continnation of the common iliac. Passing forwards to the bladder, it ascends along the sides of that viscns to its summit, to which it gives branches ; it then passes upwards along the back part of the anterior wall of the abdomen to the umbilicns, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side. Having passed through the nmbiUcal opening, the two arteries twine round the umbilical vein, forming with it the umbilical cord ; and, ultimately, ramify in the placenta. The portion of the vessel within the abdomen is called the hypo- gastric artery ; and that external to that cavity, the umbilical artery. At Urth, when the placental circulation ceases, the upper portion of the hypo- gastric artery, extending from the summit of the bladder upwards to the umbiUcus, contracts, and ultimately dwindles to a solid fibrous cord; but the lower portion, extending from its origin (in what is now the internal ihac artery) for about an inch and a half to the wall of the bladder, and thence to the summit of that organ, is not totally impervious, though it becomes considerably reduced in size; and serves to convey blood to the bladder, under the name of the superior vesical ai'tery.. Fecidiarities as regards length. In two-thirds of a large number of cases, the length of the internal iliac varied between an inch and an inch and a half; m the remaunng third, it was more frequently longer than shorter, the maximum length being three mches, the minimum half an inch. . . , • i.- ^ i. The leno-ths of the common and internal iliac arteries bear an inverse proportion to each other, the internal iliac artery being long when the common ihac is short, and vice versa. As regards its place of division. The place of division of the internal iliac varies between the upper margin of the sacrum, and the upper border of the sacro-sciatic foramen. The arteries of the two sides in a series of cases often differed in length, but neither seemed constantly to exceed the other. Surgical Anatomy. The application of a ligature to the internal iliac artery may be a-eauired in cases of aneurism or haemorrhage affecting one of its branches. The vessel mav be secured by making an incision through the abdominal parietes in the ihac region, in a direction and to an extent similar to that for securing the common iliac; the trans- versalis fascia having been cautiously divided, and the peritoneum pushed mwards froni the iliac fossa towards the pelvis, the finger may feel the pulsation of the external ihac at the bottom of the wound; and, by tracmg this vessel upwards, the internal iliac is arnved at, opposite the sacro-iUac articulation. It should be remembered that the vein hes behind, and on the right side, a little external to the artery, and m close contact with it; the ureter and peritoneum, which lie in front, must also be avoided. The degi-ee of facihty in apply- ing a ligature to this vessel will mainly depend upon its length. It has been seen that, in the great majority of the cases examined, the artery was short varying from au inch to au inch and a hllf; in these cases, the artery is deeply seated m the pelvis; when, on the con- Imry, the vessel is longer, it is found partly above that cavity. If the artery is very short occasionaUy happens, it v^ould be preferable to apply a ligatiure to the common iliac, or upon the external and internal iliacs at their origin. , i • wi „ ;„+„^<.i \\\an Collateral Ciratdation.

It extends to the side of the bladder, distributing numerous branches to the body and fundus of the organ. From one of these a slender vessel is derived, which accompanies the vas deferens in its course to the testis, where it anastomoses with the spermatic artery. This is the artery of the vas deferens. Other branches supply the ureter. The middle vesical, usually a branch of the superior, is distributed to the base of the bladder, and under surface of the vesiculse seminales. The inferior vesical arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac, in common with the middle hsemorrhoidal, and is distributed to the base of the bladder, the prostate gland, and vesiculse seminales. The branches distributed to the prostate communicate with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The middle hcemorrhoidal artery usually arises together with the preceding vessel. It suppHes the rectum, anastomosing with the other hcemorrhoidal arteries. The uterine artery passes downwards from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac to the neck of the uterus. Ascending, in a tortuous course, on the side of this viscus, between the layers of the broad ligament, it distributes branches to its substance, anastomosing, near its termination, with a branch from the ovarian artery. Branches from this vessel are also distributed to the bladder and ureter. The vaginal artery is analogous to the inferior vesical in the male ; it descends upon the vagina, supplying its mucous membrane, and sending branches to the neck of the bladder and contiguous part of the rectum. The Obturator Artbrt usually arises from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, frequently from the posterior. It passes forwards below the brim of the pelvis, to the canal in the upper border of the obturator foramen, and escaping from the pelvic cavity through this aperture, divides into an internal and an external branch. In the pelvic cavity this vessel lies upon the pelvic fascia, beneath the peritoneum, and a little below the obturator nerve ; and whilst passing through the obturator foramen, is contained in an oblique canal, formed by the horizontal branch of the pubes, above; and the arched border of the obturator membrane, below. * Medico- Chinirgical Trans., vol. xvi. DDARTERIES. 402 Branches. Within the pehts, the obturator artery gives off an iliac hra/iich to the iliac fossa, ■which supplies the bone, and the Iliacus muscle, and anastomoses with the ilio-lunibar artery ; a vesical branch, which runs backwards to supply the bladder ; and a 'pulio branch, which is given off from the vessel just before it loaves the pelvic cavity. This branch ascends upon the back of the pubes, com, municating with ollsots from the epigastric artery, and with the corresponding vessel of tho opposite side. This branch is placed on the inner side of the femoral ring. External to the pelvis, tho obturator artery divides into an external and an internal branch, which are deeply situated beneath tho Obturator externus muscle ; skirting the circumference of the obturator foramen, they anastomose at the lower part of this aperture with each other, and with branches of the internal circumflex artery. The internal branch curves inwards along the inner margin of the obturator foramen, distributing branches to the Obturator muscles, Pectineus, Adductors, and Gracilis, and anastomoses with the external branch, and with the internal circumflex artery. The external branch curves round tho outer margin of the foramen, to the space between the Gemellus inferior and Quadratus femoris, where it anastomoses with the sciatic artery. It supplies the Obturator muscles, anastomoses, as it passes backwards, with the internal cii'cnmflex, and sends a branch to the hip- joint through the cotyloid notch, which ramifies on tho round ligament as far as the head of the femur. Peculiarities. In two out of every three cases the obturator arises from the internal iliac ; in one case in 3^ from the epigastric; and in about one in seventy-two cases by two roots from both vessels. It arises in about the same proportion from the external iliac artery. The origin of the obturator from the epigastric is not commonly found on both sides of the same body. When the obturator artery arises at the front of the pelvis from the epigastric, it descends almost vertically to the upper part of the obturator foramen. The artery in this course usually Ues in contact with the external iliac vein, and on the outer side of the femoral ring (228, hg. i) ; in such ca.ses it would not be endangered in the operations for femoral hernia Occasionally, however, it curves inwards along the free margin of Gimbernat's hgament (228, fig. 2), and under such circumstances would almost completely encircle the neck of a hernial sac (supposing a hernia to exist in such a case), and would be in great danger of being wounded if an operation was performed. 228.—Variations in Origin and Course of Obturator Artery. The Internal Puclic is the smaller of tho two terminal branches of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, and supplies the external organs of generation. It passes downwards and outwards to the lower border of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and emerges from the pelvis between the Pyriformis and Coccygeus muscles ; it then crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The artery now crosses the Obtui-ator internus muscle, to the ramus of the ischium, being covered by the obturator fascia, and situated about an inch and a half from the margin of the tuberosity ; it then ascends forwards and upwards along the ramus of the ischium, pierces the posterior layer of the deep perinoDal fascia, and runs forwards along the inner margin of the ramus of the pubes ; finally, it perforates the anterior layer of the deep periniEal fascia, and divides into its two terminal branches, the dorsal artery of the penis, and the artery of the corpus caveruosum.INTERNAL PUDIC. 403 Belations. In the first part of its course, within tho polvis, it lies in front of 1,0 Pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus of nerves, and on the outer side of the .turn (on the left side). As it crosses the spine of the ischium, it :s covered Uv the Gluteus maxinms, and great sacro-sciatic ligament. In ^h^ pelvis it lies . u the outer side of the ischio-rectal fossa, upon the surface of the Obturator intornus muscle, contained in a fibrous canal formed by the obturator fascia and tl.o falciform process of the great sacro-sclatic ligament. It is accompanied by the pudic veins, and the internal pudic nerve. Pemliarities. The internal pudic is sometimes smaller than usual, or fails to give off one or two of its usual branches; in such cases, the deficiency is supplied by branches derived from an additional vessel, the accessory pudic, which generally arises from the pudic artery before its exit from the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and passes forwards near the base of the bladder, on the upper part of the prostate gland, to the perinaeum, where it gives off the branches, usually derived from the pudic artery. The deficiency most frequently met with, is that in which the internal pudic ends as the artery of the bulb; the artery of the corpus cavernosum and arteria dorsahs penis being derived from the accessory pudic. Or the pudic may terminate as the superficial perinseal, the artery of the bulb being derived, with the other two branches, from the accessory vessel. ^ The relation of the accessory pudic to the prostate gland and urethra, is of the greatest mterest in a surgical point of view, as this -yessel is in danger of being wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy. . Branches. Within the pehis, the internal pudic gives off several small branches which supply.the muscles, sacral nerves, and pelvic viscera. In the perinceum the following branches are given ofi': i> D 2 .404 ARTERIES. Inferior or exfcei'nal LiBmorrlioidal. Artery of the bulb. Superhcial perinaaal. Artery of the corpus cavernosum. Transverse periua)al. Dorsal artery of the penis. The external liamorrhoidal are two or three small arteries, which arise from i the internal pudic as it passes above the tuberosity of the ischium. Crossing the ^ ischio-rectal fossa, thoy are distributed to the muscles and integument of the anal I region. The superficial peri/rueal artery supplies the scrotum and muscles and integcu . ment of the periuceum. It arises from the internal pudic, in front of the preceding • branches, and piercing the lower border of the deep perinoaal fascia, runs acrosB i the Transversus poi-inasi, and through the triangular space between the Accelerator ■ urinaa and Erector penis, both of which it supplies, and is finally distributed to the skin of the scrotum and dartos. In its passage through the perinaeum it lies beneath the superficial perinceal fascia. The transverse perinaial is a small branch which arises either from the internal pudic, or from the superficial perinaeal artery as it crosses the Transversus perinaei muscle. Piercing the lower border of the deep perinasal fascia, it runs trans- versely inwards along the cutaneous surface of the Transversus perinaei muscle, which it supplies, as well as the structures between the anus and bulb of the urethra. The artery of the Inolh is a large but very short vessel which arises from the in- ternal pudic between the two layers of the deep perinaeal fascia, and passing nearly transversely inwards, pierces the bulb of the urethra, in which it ramifies. It gives ofi" a small branch which descends to supply Cowper's gland. This artery is of considerable importance in a surgical point of view, as it is in danger of being wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy, an accident usually attended in the adult with alarming htemorrhage. The vessel is sometimes very small, occasionally wanting, or even double. It sometimes arises from the internal pudic earlier than usual, and crosses the perinteum to reach the back part of the bulb. In such a case the vessel could hardly fail to be wounded in the performance of the lateral operation for lithotomy. If, on the contrary, it should arise from an ac- cessory pudic, it lies more forward than usual, and is out of danger in the operation. The artery of the corpus cavernosum, one of the terminal branches of the internal pudic, arises from that vessel while it is situated between the cms penis and the ramus of the pubes ; piercing the crus penis obliquely, it runs forwards in the corpus cavernosum by the side of the septum pectiniforme, to which its branches are distributed. The dorsal artery of the penis ascends between the crus and pubic symphysis, and piercing the suspensory lioament, runs forwards on the dorsum of the penis to the glans, where it divides into two branches, which supply the glans and prepuce. On the dorsum of the penis, it lies immediately beneath the integument, parallel with the dorsal vein, and the corresponding artery of the opposite side. It supplies the inteo-ument and fibrous sheath of the corpus cavernosum. The internal pudic artery in the female is smaller than in the male. Its origin and course are similar, and there is considerable analogy in the distribution of its branches. The superficial artery supplies the labia pudenda; the artery of the bulb supplies tbe erectile tissue of the bulb of the vagina, whilst the two terminal branches supply the cUtoris ; the artery of the corpus cavernosum, the cavernous body of the clitoris ; and the arteria dorsahs clitoridis, the dorsum of that organ. The Sciatic Artery (fig, 230), the larger of the two terminal branches of the anterior trunk of the internal ihac, is distributed to the muscles on the back ot the pelvis. It passes down to the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, behind the internal pudic, resting on the sacral plexus of nerves and Pyriformis muscle, and escapes from the pelvis between the Pyriformis and Coccygeas. it then descends in the interval between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, accompanied by the sciatic nerves, and covered by the Gluteus maximus, and di vides into branches, which supply the deep muscles at the back of the bip.ILIO-LUMBAR. 405 Within the pehis it distributes branches to tbe Pyrlforrnis Coccygeus and Witiim tne peiwu, lu ^ Wnrbes wh ch supply tbe rectum, and Levator ani muscles; l^™";^"^^'^!,^,;^^^^^^ and vesical occasionally take the place of tbe middle lrn\nn}ei and nrostate l.raucbes to^he base and neck of the ladder, vesxcute semm^^^^^^^^^ oland.

The coccygeal branch runs inwards, pierces the great sacro-sciatic liga- ment, and supplies the Gluteus maximus, tbe in- tegument, and other struc- tures on the back of tbe coccyx. The inferior gluteal branches, three or four in number, supply the Gluteus maximus muscle. The comes nervi ischia- dici is a long slender vessel, which accompanies the great sciatic nerve for a short distance; it then penetrates it, and runs in its substance to the lower part of tbe thigh. Tbe muscular branches supply tbe muscles on tbe back part of the hip, anas- tomosing with tbe gluteal, internal and external cir- cumflex, and superior per- forating arteries. Some articular branches are distributed to the cap- sule of tbe hip-joint. The Ilio-Lumbar Artery ascends beneatli tbe Psoas muscle and external iliac vessels, to tbe upper part of tbe iliac fossa, where it divides into a lumbar and an iliac branch. Tbe himbar branch sup- plies the Psoas and Quad- ratus lumborum muscles, anastomosing with tbe last lumbar artery, and sends a small spinal branch through tbe intervertebral foramen, between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, into tbe spinal cana,l, to supply the spinal cord and its membranes. The ihac brwiich descends to supply the Iliacus internus, some offsets running between the muscle and the bone, one of which enters an oblique canal to supply the diploe, whilst others run along tbe crest of the ilium, distributing branches to the Gluteal and Abdominal muscles, and anastomosing in their coui-se with the gluteal, circumflex iliac, exteraal circumflex, and epigastric arteries. Te rtn ma tioTt. rf Superior £xt^rual Jh tlcularARTERIES. 4o6 The Lateral Sacral Arteries (fig. 227) are usually two in number on eaoh side, superior and inferior. The superior, which is of largo size, passes inwards, and, after anastomosing with 1 branches from the middle sacral, enters the first or second sacral foramen, is ; distributed to the contents of the sacral canal, and escaping by the corresponding > posterior sacral foramen, supplies the skin and muscles on the dorsum of the sacrum. The inferior hramch passes obliquely across the front of the Pyriformis muscle, and sacral nerves to the inner side of the anterior sacral foramina, descends on th© jtj front of the sacrum, and anastomoses over the coccyx with the sacra media and", opposite lateral sacral arteries. In its course, it gives off branches, which enter' the anterior sacral foramina: these, after supplying the bones and membranes off the interior of the spinal canal, escape by the posterior sacral foramina, and are distributed to the muscles and skin on the dorsal surface of the sacrum. ^ The Gluteal Artery is the largest branch of the internal iliac, and appears to be f the continuation of the posterior division of that vessel. It is a short, thick trunk, j which passes out of the pelvis above the upper border of the Pyriformis muscle, ' and immediately divides into a superficial and deep branch. Within the pelvis, it . gives off a few muscular branches to the Iliacus, Pyriformis, and Obturator internus, and just previous to quitting that cavity a nutrient artery, which enters the ilium. The superficial hra/ncJi passes beneath the Gluteus maximus, and divides into numerous branches, some of which supply that muscle, whilst others per- forate its tendinous origin, and supply the integument covering the posterior surface of the sacrum, anastomosing with the posterior branches of the sacral arteries. The deep hranch runs between the Gluteus medius and minimus, and sub- divides into two. Of these, the superior division, continuing the original course of the vessel, passes along the upper border of the Gluteus minimus to the anterior superior spine of the iHum, anastomosing with the circumflex iliac and ascending branches of the external circumflex artery. The inferior division crosses the Gluteus minimus obliquely to the trochanter major, distributing branches to the Glutei muscles, and inosculates with the external circumflex artery. Some branches pierce the Gluteus minimus to supply the hip-joint. External Iliac Artery. (Fig- 227.) The external iliac artery is the chief vessel which supplies the lower limb. It is larger in the adult than the internal iliac, and passes obliquely downwards and outwards along the inner border of the Psoas muscle, from the bifurcation of the common iliac to the femoral arch, where it enters the thigh, and becomes the femoral artery. The course of this vessel would be indicated by a line drawn from the left side of the umbilicus to a point midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium aiid the symphysis pubis. Relations. In front, with the peritoneum, subperitoneal areolar tissue, the intestines, and a thin layer of fascia, derived from the iliac fascia, which surrounds the artery and vein. At its origin it is occasionally crossed by the ureter. The spermatic vessels descend for some distance upon it near its termination, and :t is crossed in this situation by a branch of the genito-crural nerve and the circumflex iliac vein; the vas deferens curves down along its inner side. Behind, it is la relation with the external iliac vein, which, at the femoral arch, lies at its mner side ; on the left side the vein is altogether internal to the artery. Externally, li- rests against the Psoas muscle, from which it is separated by the iliac fascia. The artery rests upon this muscle near Poupart's ligament. Numerous lymphatic vessels and glands are found lying on the front and inner side of the vessel.EXTERNAL ILIAC. 4°? Plan of the Relations of tue External Iliac Artery. In f ront.

The application of a ligature to the external iliac may he required in cases of aneurism of the femoral artery, or in cases of secondary htemorrhage, alter the latter vessel has been tied for popliteal aneurism. This vessel may be secured m any part ot its course, excepting near its upper end, which is to be avoided on account of the proximity ot the great stream of blood in the internal iliac, and near its lower end, which should also be avoided, on account of the proximity of the epigastric and circumflex iliac vessels. _ One ot the chief points in tlie performance of the operation is to secure the vessel without injury to the peritoneum. The patient having heen placed in the recumbent position, an incision should be made, commencing below at a point about three quarters of an inch above Poupart s ligament, and a little external to its middle, and running upwards and outwards, parallel to Poupart's ligament, to a point above the anterior superior spine of the ilium. When the artery is deeply seated, more room will be required, and may be obtained by curving the incision from the point last named inwards towards the umbilicus for a short distance; or, if the lower part of the artery is to be reached, the surgeon may commence the incision nearer the inner end of Poupart's ligament, taking care to avoid the epigastric artery. Abernethy, ■who first tied this artery, made his incision in the course of the vessel. The precise line of incision selected is of less moment, provided an easy access to the deeper parts is secured. The abdominal muscles and transversalis fascia having been cautiously divided, the peritoneum should be separated from the iliac fossa and pushed towards the pelvis; and on introducing the finger to the bottom of the wound the artery may be felt pulsating along the inner border of the Psoas muscle. The external iliac vein is generally found on the inner side of the artery, and must be cautiously separated from it i)y the iinger-nail, or handle of the knife, and the aneurism needle should be introduced on the inner side, between the artery and vein. Collateral Cirodation. The principal anastomoses in carrying on the collateral circulation, after the application of a ligature to the external iliac, are—the ilio-lumbar with the circum- flex iliac; the gluteal with the external circumflex ; the obturator with the internal circum- flex ; the sciatic with the superior perforating and circumflex branches of the profunda artery; the internal pudio with the external pudic, and with the internal circumflex. When the. obturator arises from the epigastric, it is supplied with blood by branches, either from the internal iliac, the lateral sacral, or the internal pudic. The epigastric receives its supply from the internal mammaiy and inferior intercostal arteries, and from the internal iliac, by the anastomoses of its branches with the obturator. In the dissection of a limb, eighteen years after tbe successful ligature of the external iliac artery, by Sir A. Cooper, which is to be found in Guy's Hospital Reports, vol. i. p. 50, the anastomosing branches are described in three sets. An anterior set. i. A very large branch firom the ilio-lumbar artery to the circumflex iliac; 2. Another branch from the ilio-lumbar, joined by one from the obturator, and breaking up into numerous tortuous branches to anastomose with the external circumflex; 3. Two other branches from the obturator, which passed over the brim of the pelvis, communicated with the epigastric, and then broke up into a plexus to anastomose with the internal circumflex. An internal set. Branches given off from the obturator, after quitting the pelvis, which ramified among the adductor muscles on the inner side of the hip-joint, and joined most freely with branches of the internal circumflex. A posterior set. I. Three large branches from the gluteal to the external circumflex; 2. Several branches from the sciatic around the great sciatic notch to the internal and external circumflex, and the perforatmg branches of the profunda. Brcmches. Besides several small branctes to the Psoas muscles and the neighbouring lymphatic glands, the external iliac gives off two branches of con- siderable size, the Epigastric and Circumflex iliac. The Epigastric artery arises from the external iliac, a few lines above Poupart's4o8 ARTERIES. ligament. It at first descends to reach this ligament, and then ascends obliquely inwards between the peritonenm and ti-ansvorsalis fascia, to the margin of the sheath of the Rectus muscle. Having perforated tbo sheath near its lower third, it runs vertically upwards behind the Rectus, to which it is distributed, dividing into numerous branches, which anastomose above the umbilicus with the terminal branches of the internal mammary and inferior intercostal arteries. It is accom. panied by two veins, which usually unite into a single trunk before their termina- tion in the external iliac vein. As this artery ascends from Poupart's ligament to the Rectus, it lies behind the inguinal canal, to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring, and immediately above the femoral ring. The vas deferens in the male, and the roand ligament in the female, cross behind the artery in descending into the pelvis. Branches. The branches of this vessel are the following: the cremasteric, which accompanies the spermatic cord, and supplies the Cremaster muscle, anasto- niosing with the spermatic artery; a piohic branch, which runs across Poupart's ligament, and then descends behind the pubes to the inner side of the femoral ring, and anastomoses with oflFsets from the obturator artery; muscular branches, some of which are distributed to the abdominal muscles and peritoneum, anastomosing with the lumbar and circumflex iliac arteries; others perforate the tendon of the External oblique and supply the integument, anastomosing with branches of the external epigastric. FecuUarities. The origin of the epigastric may take place from any part of the external iliac between Poupart's ligament and two inches and a half above it; or it may arise below this ligament, from the femoral, or from the deep femoral. Union with Branches. It frequently arises from the external iliac, by a common trunk with the obturator. Sometimes the epigastric arises from the obturator, the latter vessel being furnished by the internal iliac, or the epigastric may be formed of two branches, one derived from the external iliac, the others from the internal iliac. The circumflex iliac artery arises from the outer side of the external iliac, nearly opposite the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely outwards behind Poupart's ligament, and runs along the inner surface of the crest of the ilium to about its middle, where it pierces the Transversalis, and runs backwards between that muscle and the Internal oblique, to anastomose with the ilio-lumbar and gluteal arteries. Opposite the anterior superior spine of the ihum, it gives olF a large branch, which ascends between the Internal obHque and Transversahs muscles, supplying them and anastomosing with the lumbar and epigastric arteries. The circumflex ihac artery is accompanied by two veins. These unite into a single trunk which crosses the external iliac artery just above Poupart's ligament, and enters the external iliac vein. Eemokal Artery. (Fig. 231.) The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac. It commences immediately behind Poupart's ligament, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, and passing down the fore part and inner side of the thigh, terminates at the opening in the Adductor magnns, at the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thigh, where it becomes the popHteal artery. A line drawn from a point midway between the anterior supenor spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis to the inner side of the inner condyle of the femur, will be nearly parallel with the course of the artery. This vessel, at the upper part of the thigh, lies a little internal to the head of the femur ; in the lower part of its course, on the inner side of the shaft of the bone, and between these two parts, the vessel is separated from the bone by a considerable extent. In the upper third of the thigh the femoral artery is very superficial, being covered by the integument, inguinal glands, and the superficial and deep fasciffi, and is contained in a triangular space, called ' Scarpa's triangle.' Scarpa's Triangle. Scarpa's triangle corresponds to the depression seen imme- diately below the fold of the groin.

The artery in this situation has in front of it filaments from the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, and branches from the anterior crural, one of which is usually of considerable size; behind the artery is the branch to the Pectineus from the anterior crural. The femoral vein lies at its inner side, between the margins of the Pectineus and Psoas muscles. The anterior crm-al nerve lies about half an inch to the outer side of the femoral artery, deeply imbedded between the Iliacus and Psoas muscles. The femoral artery and vein are en- closed in a strong fibrous sheath, formed by fibrous and cellular tissue, and by a process of fascia sent in- wards, from the fascia lata ; the vessels are separated, however, from one another by thin fibrous partitions. In the middle third of the thigh, the femoral artery is more deeply seated, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fascia, and the Sartorius, and is contained in an apo- neurotic canal (Hunter's canal), formed by a dense fibrous band, which extends transversely from the Vas- tus internus to the tendons of the Adductor longus and magnus muscles. In this part of its course it lies in a depression, bounded externally by the Vastus internus, internally by the Adductor longus and Adductor magnus.

From above dmonwards, the femoral artery rests upon the Psoas muscle, which separates it from the margin of the pelvis and capsular ligament of the hip ; it is next separated fi-om the Pectineus by the profunda vessels and femoral vein ; it then lies upon the Adductor longus ; and lastly, upon the tendon of the Adductor magnus, the femoral vein being interposed. To its irmer side, it is in relation above, with the femoral vein, and lower down, with the Adductor longus, and Sartorius. To its outer side, the Vastus internus separates it from the femur, in the lower part of its course. The femoral vein, at Poupart's ligament, lies close to the inner side of the artery, separated from it by a thin fibrous partition, but, as it descends, gets be- hind it, and then to its outer side. The internal saphenous nerve is situated on the outer side of the artery, in the middle third of the thigh, beneath the aponeurotic covering, but not usually within the sheath of the vessels. Small cutaneous nerves cross the front of the sheath. Plan of the Relations of the Femoral Arteey. In front. Fascia lata. Eranch of anterior crural nei"ve. Sartorius. Long saphenous nerve.

Four cases are at present recorded, in which the femoral artery divided into two trunks below the origin of the profimda, and became re-united near the opening in the Adductor magnus, so as to form a single popliteal artery. One of them occurred in a patient operated upon for pophteal aneurism. Change of Position. A similar number of cases have been recorded, in which the femoral artery was situated at the back of the thigh, the vessel being continuous above with the internal iliac, escaping from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and ac- companying the great sciatic nerve to the popliteal space, where its division occurred in the usual manner. Position of tlie Vein. The femoral vein is occasionally placed along the inner side of the artery, throughout the entire extent of Scarpa's triangle; or it may be slit, so that a large vein is placed on each side of the artery for a greater or less extent. Origin of the Profunda. This vessel occasionally arises from the inner side, and more rarely, from the back of the common trunk; but the more important pecuUarity, hi a surgical point of view, is that which relates to the height at which the vessel arises from the femoral. In three-fourths of a large number of cases, it arose between one or two inches below Poupart's ligament; in a few cases, the distance was less than an inch; more rarely, opposite the liga- ment ; and in one case, above Poupart's hgaraent, fi-om the external iliac. Occasionally, the distance between the origin of the vessel and Poupart's ligament exceeds two inches, and in one case it was found to be as much as four inches. Surgical Anatomy. Connvcssion of the femoral artery, which is constantly^requisite m amputations and other operations on the lower limb, is most effectually made immediately below Poupart's ligament. In this situation the artery is very superficial, and is merely separated from the margin of the acetabulum and front of the head of the femur, by the Psoas muscle; so that the surgeon, by means of his thumb, or a compressor, may efl'ectually control the circulation through it. This vessel may also be compressed in the middle third of the thigh, by placing a compress over the artery, beneath the tourniquet, and directingFEMORAL. 411 L 1 „„ o,-,mTivPfi8 the vessel on the inner side of the shaft Iho pressure from within outwards, so as to compiess luo vo of the femur. ^ ,• , . f„mm-il avtorv may be required in cases of wound The application ofalujature ^^^L^^^^^^^ "^'^^ or aneurism of the arteries ot the leg, of P°P ^^^^^^^^^ of this vessel at its lower part, exposed and tied in any part of its course, ihe gieat J«P^ j ^ -^^ ^^^^^^ render the its close connection with ^-^PO/tant strtu^turej^ operation in this situation one of much greater duncuisy wmu i. 11 its upper part, where it is more superficial. . . ^^^^^^-^ considered Ligature of the femoral ^^\«>T, J " ^^^^^^^ and circumflex unsafe, on account of the connection of large blanches ^1 occasionally, iliac arising just above its origin .; the profimda, ftoni one to J, also one of the circnrailex arteries arises trom tne vessel lu i,uu v,a+woAn The'profunda sometimes arises higher than the point '^^^T.-^^^'^ J^^fj^"JlHt^eJi Z two or three inches (in one case four) below Poupart's ligament It would appeiw^ tne°» hat the most favourable situation for tie application of a hgature to ^be femoi^l, is b^^^^^^^^ tour and five inches from its point of origin. In order to expose the artery in th^s situation, an incision, between two and three inches long, should be niade he cou se of the vessel, the patient lying in the recumbent position, with the hmb slightly flexed, and abd-^cted. A large vein is frequently met with, passing in the course of the artery to join the saphe^a this must be avoided, and the fascia lata having been cautiously divided, and the Sartorius exposed, that muscle must be drawn outwards, in order to lully expose the sheath ot the vessels. The linger being introduced into the wound, and the pulsation of the artery felt, the sheath should be divided over the artery to a sufficient extent to allow ot the introduction of the ligature, but no further; otherwise the nutrition of the coats of the vessel may be interfered with, or muscular branches which arise from the vessel at irregular intervals may be divided. In this part of the operation, a small nerve which crosses the sheath should be avoided. The auem-ism needle must be carefuUy introduced and kept close to the artery, to avoid the femoral vein, which lies behmd the vessel in this part ot its ^jjg middle of the thigh, an incision should be made through the inteo-ument, between three and four inches in length, over the inner margin of the Sartorius takiu'^ care to avoid the internal saphenous vein, the situation of which may be previously known by compressing it higher up in the thigh. The fascia lata having been divided, and the Sartorius muscle exposed, it should be drawn outwards, when the strong fascia which is stretched across from the Adductors to the Vastus internus, will be exposed, and must be freely divided; the sheath of the vessels is now seen, and must be opened, and the artery secured bypassing the aneurism needle between the vein and artery, in the direction from within outwards. The femoral vein in this situation lies on the outer side of the artery, the long saphenous nerve on its anterior and outer side. It has been seen that the femoral artery occasionally divides into two trunks, below the origin of the profunda. If, in the operation for tying the femoral, two vessels are met with, the" surgeon should alternately compress each, in order to ascertain which vessel is connected with the aneurisraal tumour, or with the bleeding from the wound, and that one only should be tied which controls the pulsation or haemorrhage. If, however, it is necessary to compress both vessels before the circulation in the tumour is controlled, both should be tied, as it ■would be probable that they became re-united, as in the four instances referred to above. _ Collateral Circulation. When the common femoral is tied, the main channels for carrying on the circulation are the anastomoses of the gluteal find circumflex iliac arteries above with the external circumflex below; of the obturator and sciatic above with the internal circumflex below; of the ilio-lumbar with the external circumflex, and of the comes nervi ischiadic! ■with the arteries in the ham. The principal agents in cai-rying on the collateral circulation after ligature of the super- ficial femoral artery are, according to Sir A. Cooper, as follows.* 'The arteria profunda formed the new channel for the blood.' ' The first artery sent off passed down close to the back of the thigh bone, and entered the two superior articular ■branches of the popliteal artery.' 'The second new large vessel arising from the profunda at the same part with the former, passed down by the inner side of the Biceps muscle, to an artery of the popliteal which was distributed to the Gastrocnemius muscle; whilst a third artery dividing into several branches passed down with the sciatic nerve behind the knee-joint, and some of its branches united themselves with the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal, with some recurrent ■branches of those arteries, with arteries passing to the Gastrocnemii, and, lastly, with the origin of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.' ' It appears then that it is those branches of the profunda which accompany the sciatic nerve that are the principal supporters of the new circulation.' In Porta'a work t (Tab. xii. xiii.) is a good representation of the collateral circulation after the ligature of the femoral artery. The patient had survived the operation three years. The lower part of the artery is, at least, as large as the upper; about two inches of tlie vessel appear to have been obliterated. The external and internal circumflex arteries are seen anastomosing by a great number of branches with the lower branches of the femoral (mus- * Med.-Chir. Trans., yol. 11. 1811. f jiMcrazionipatoloijiohc dcUc Artcric.ARTERIES. 412 cular and anastomotica magna), and with the articular branches of the popliteal. The branches from the external circumilGX are extremely large and numerous, one very distinct anastomosis can be traced between this artery on the outside, and the anastomotica magna on the inside, through the intervention of the superior external articular artery with whicli they both anastomose, and blood reaches even the anterior tibial recurrent from the external cir- cumflex by means of an anastomosis with the same external articular artery. The perforating branches of the profunda are also seen bringing blood round the obliterated portion of the artery into long branches (muscular) which have been given ofl" just below that portion. The termination of the profunda itself anastomoses most freely with the superior external articular. A long branch of anastomosis is also traced down from the internal iliac by means of the comes nervi ischiadici of the sciatic which anastomoses on the popliteal nerves with branches from tiie popliteal and posterior tibial arteries. In this case the anastomosis had been too free, since the pulsation and growth of the aneurism recurred, and the patient died after ligature of the external iliac. There is an interesting preparation in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, of a limb on which John Hunter had tied the femoral artery fifty years before the patient's death. The whole of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery seems to have been obliterated. The anastomosis by means of the comes nervi ischiadici, which is shown in Porta's plate, is distinctly seen: the external circumflex, and the termination of the profunda artery, seem to have been the chief channels of anastomosis; but the injection has not been a very successful one. Branches. The branches o£ the femotal artery are the Superficial epigastric. Superficial circumflex iliac. Superficial external pudic. Deep external pudic. r External circumflex. Profunda. < Internal circumflex. L Three perforating. Muscular. Anastomotica magna. The superficial epigastric arises from the femoral, about half an inch below Poupart's hgament, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, ascends on to the abdomen, in the superficial fascia covering the external oblique muscle, nearly as high as the umbilicus. It distributes branches to the inguinal glands, the superficial fascia and the integument, anastomosing with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary arteries. The superficial circumfiex iliac, the smallest of the cutaneous branches, arises close to the preceding, and, piercing the fascia lata, runs outwards, parallel with Poupart's ligament, as far as the crest of the ilium, dividing into branches which supply the integument of the groin, the superficial fascia, and inguinal glands, anastomosing with the circumflex iliac, and with the gluteal and external circum- flex arteries. The superficial external pudic (superior), arises from the inner side of the femoral artery, close to the preceding vessels, and, after piercing the fascia lata at the saphenous opening, passes inwards, across the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen, the penis and scrotum in bhe male, and the labium in the female, anastomosing with branches of the internal pudic. The deep external pudic (inferior), more deeply seated than the preceding, passes inwards on the Pectineus muscle, covered by the fascia lata, which it pierces oppo- site the ramus of the pubes, its branches being distributed, in the male, to the integument of the scrotum and perineenm, and in the female, to the labium, anas- tomosing with branches of the superficial perinseal artery. The Profunda Femoris (deep femoral artery) nearly equals the size of the superficial femoral. It arises from the outer and back part of the femoi-al artery, from one to two inches below Poupart's ligament. It at first lies on the outer side of the superficial femoral, and then passes behind it and the femoral vein to the inner side of the femur, and terminates at the lower third of the thigh m a small branch, which pierces the Adductor magnus, to be distributed to the flexorPROFUNDA. 413 , , , n . 1 • V, „^oa+nmn<?iii0-with, branches of the popliteal and muscles on the back of the thigh, anastomosing w inferior perforating ai^eries Adductor EeZa^^-o.. it hes UP«" f! ^^^^^ ,3p,,,ted from the femoral brevis and Adductor magnus muscles.

Behind. Iliacus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. The External Circumflex Artery supphes the muscles on the front of the thigh. It arises from the outer side of the profunda, passes horizontally outwards, between the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and behind the Sartorius and Rectus muscles, and divides into three sets of branches, ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending branches pass upwards, beneath the Tensor vaginae femoris muscle, to the outer side of the hip, anastomosing with the terminal branches of the gluteal and circumflex iliac arteries. The descending branches, three or four in number, pass downwards, behind the Rectus, upon the Vasti muscles, to which they are distributed, one or two passing beneath the Vastus externns as far as the knee, anastomosing with the superior articular branches of the popliteal artery. The transverse branches, the smallest and least numerous, pass outwards over the CrursBus, pierce the Vastus externns, and wind round the femur to its back part, just below the great trochanter, anastomosing at the back of the thigh with the internal circumflex, sciatic, and superior perforating arteries. The Internal Circumflex Artery, smaller than the external, arises from the inner and back part of the profunda, and winds round the inner side of the femur, between the Pectineus and Psoas muscles. On reaching the tendon of the Obturator externns, it gives ofi" two branches, one of which passes inwards to be distributed to the Adductor muscles, the Gracilis, and Obturator externns, anasto- mosing with the obturator artery; the other descends, and passes beneath the Adductor brevis, to supply it and the great Adductor; while the continuation of the vessel passes backwards, between the Qnadratus femoris and upper border of the Adductor magnus, anastomosing with the sciatic, external circumflex, and superior perforating arteries. Opposite the hip-joint, this branch gives off an, articular vessel, which enters the joint beneath the transverse ligament; and after supplying the adipose tissue, passes along the round ligament to the head of the bone. The Perforating Arteries (fig. 230), usually three in number, are so called fi-om their perforating the tendons of the Adductor brevis and magnus muscles to reach the back of ihe thigh. The first is given off above the Adductor brevis, the second in front of that muscle, and the third immediately below it. The^'ra^ or superior perforating artery passes backwards between the Pectineus and Adductor brevis (sometimes perforates the latter) ; it then pierces the Adductor magnus close to the linea aspera, and divides into branches which supply both Adductors, the Biceps, and Gluteus maximus muscle; anastomosing with the sciatic, internal circumflex, and middle perforating arteries.414 AUTERIES. The second ov miildlo perforatmg artery, ]n,rgcr than the first, pierces the tendons of the Adductor brevis and Adductor magnus muscles, and divides into ascending and descending branches, which supply the flexor muscles of the thigh, anasto- mosing with the superior and inferior perforating. The nutrient artery of the femur is usually given off from this branch. The third or inferior perforating artery is given off below the Adductor brevis ; it pierces the Adductor magnus, and divides into branches which supply the flexor muscles of the thigh ; anastomosing with the perforating arteries above, and with the terminal branches of the profunda below. Miiscidar Branches are given off from the superficial femoral throughout its entire course. They vary from two to seven in. number, and supply chiefly the Sartorius and Vastus intornus. The Anastomotica Magna arises from the femoral artery just before it passes through the tendinous opening in the Adductor magnus muscle, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The superficial branch accompanies the long saphenous nerve, beneath the Sartorius, and, piercing the fascia lata, is distributed to the integument. The deep hranch descends in the substance of the Vastus intemus, lying in front of the tendon of the Adductor magnus, to the inner side of the knee, where it anastomoses with the superior internal articular artery and recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. A branch from this vessel crosses outwards above the articular surface of the femur, forming an anastomotic arch with the superior external articular artery, and supplies branches to the knee-joint. Popliteal Arteey. The popliteal artery commences at the termination of the femoral, at the opening in the Adductor magnus, and, passing obliquely downwards and outwards behind the knee-joint to the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Through the whole of this extent the artery lies in the popliteal space. The Popliteal Space. (Pig. 232.) Dissection. A vertical incision about eight inches in length should be made along the hack part of the knee-ioint, connected above and helow by a transvei-se mcision from the inner to the outer side of the hmh. The flaps of integument included between these mcisions should he reflected in the direction shown in fig. 189, p. 303. On removing the integument, the superficial fascia is exposed, and ramifying in it along the middle line are found some filaments of the small sciatic nerve, and towards the. inner part some offsets from the internal cutaneous nerve. The superficial fascia having been removed, the fascia lata is brought into view. In this region it is strong and dense, being strengthened by transverse fibres, and firmly attached to the tendons on the inner and outer sides of the space. It is perforated below by the external saphenous vein. This fascia having been reflected back in the same direction as the integument, the small sciatic nerve and external saphenous vein are seen immediately beneath it, in the middle Ime. If the loose adipose tissue is now removed, the boundaries and contents of the space may be ^^""pWanes. The popliteal space, or the ham, occnpies the lower thii-d of the thigh and the upper fifth of the leg; extending from the aperture in the Adductor magnus, to the lower border of the Popliteus muscle. It is a lozenge-shaped space, being widest at the back part of the knee-joint, and deepest above the arti- cular end of the femur. It is bounded, externally, above the joint, by the Biceps, and below the joint by the Plantaris and external head of the Gastrocnemius. Internally above the joint, by the Semimembranosus, Semitendmosus, Gracilis, and Sartorius ; below the joint, by the inner head of the Gastrocnemms. _ Above it is limited by the apposition of the inner and outer hamstring muscles , bplnw bv the iunction of the two heads of the Gastrocnemius. The floor is formed by the lower part of the posterior surface of the shaft of the femur, the415 POPLITEAL. posterior ligament of the knee-joint, the upper end of the tibia and the fascia covering the Popliteus muscle, and the space is covered m by the fascia lata Conlnts. It contains the Popliteal vessels and their branches, together with the termination of the external saphenous vein, the internal and external popliteal nerves and theii- branches, the small sciatic nerve, the articular branch from the obturator nerve, a few smaU lymphatic glands, and a considerable quantity of loose adipose tissue. ^ i ■ --ui Position of contained parts. The internal popliteal nerve descends m the middle line of the space, lying superficial and a little external to the vein and artery. The external popliteal nerve descends on the outer side of the space, lying close to the tendon of the Biceps muscle. More deeply at the bottom of the space are the popliteal vessels, the vein lying superficial and a little external to the artery, to which it is closely united by dense areolar tissue ; sometimes the vein is placed on the inner instead of the outer side of the artery; or the vein may be double, the artery lying between the two ven® comites, which are usually connected by short transverse branches. More deeply, and close to the surface of the bone, is the popliteal artery, and passing ofi" from it at right angles are its articular branches. The articular branch from the obturator nerve descends upon the popliteal artery to supply the knee ; and occasionally there is found deep in the space an articular filament from the great sciatic nerve. The popliteal lymphatic glands, four or five in number, are found suiTOunding the artery; one usually lies superficial to the vessel, another is situated between it and the bone, and the rest are placed on either side of it. The bursse usually found in this space are : i. On the outer side, one beneath the outer head of the Gastrocnemius (which sometimes commu- nicates with the joint) and one beneath the tendon of the Popliteus, which is almost always an extension of the synovial membrane. Sometimes also there is a bursa above the tendon of the Popliteus, between it and the external lateral ligament. 2. On the inner side of the joint there is a large bursa between the inner head of the Gastrocnemius and the femur, which sends a prolongation between the tendons of the Gastrocnemius and Semimembranosus, and lies in contact with the ligament of "Winslow. This bursa often communicates with the joint. There is a second bursa between the tendon of the Semimembranosus and the head of the tibia; and some- times a bursa between the tendons of the Semitendinosus and Semimembranosus. The Popliteal Aeteet, in its course downwards from the aperture in the Ad- ductor magnus to the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, rests first on the inner, and then on the posterior surface of the femur ; in the middle of its course, on the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; and below, on the fascia covering the Pop- liteus muscle. Superficially, it is covered, above, by the Semimembranosus ; in the middle of its course, by a quantity of fat,, which separates it from the deep fascia and integument; and below, it is overlapped by the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, and Soleus muscles, the popliteal vein, and the internal popliteal nerve. The pop- Hteal vein, which is intimately attached to the artery, lies superficial and external to it, until near its termination, when it crosses it and lies to its inner side. The popliteal nerve is still more superficial and external, crossing, however, the artery below the joint, and lying on its inner side. Laterally, the artery is bounded by the muscles which form the boundaries of the popliteal space. _ Peculiarities in point of division. Occasionally the popliteal artery divides prematurely mto Its terminal branches; this division occurs most frequently opposite the knee-ioint Uimsual branches. The artery sometimes divides into the anterior tibial and peroneal, the posterior tibial being wanting, or very small. In a single case, the popliteal was found to divide into three branches, the antenor and posterior tibial, and peroneal. Surgical Anatomy.

To expose the vessel in the lower part of its course, where the artery lies between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius, the patient should be placed in the same position as in the pre- cedin"- operation. An incision should then be made through the integument in the middle line commencin"- opposite the bond of the knee-joint, care being taken to avoid the external saphenous vein and nerve. After dividing the deep fascia, and separating some dense cellular membrane, the artery, vein, and nerve will bo exposed, descending between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius. Some muscular branches of the popliteal should be avoided if possible or if divided, tied immediately. The leg being now liexed, in order the more effectually to"'sepnrate the two heads of the Gastrocnemius, the nerve should be drawn inwards and the vein outwards, and the aneurism needle passed between the artery and vein from without inwards.

The azygos articular is a small branch, arising from the popliteal artery opposite the bend of tho knee-joint. It pierces the posterior ligament, and supplies the ligaments and synovial membrane in the interior of tho articulation. The inferior articular arteries, two in number, arise from the popHteal, beneath the Gastrocnemius, and wind round tho head of the tibia, below the joint. The internal one passes below the inner tuberosity, beneath tho internal lateral ligament, at the anterior border of which it ascends to the front and inner side of the joint, to supply the head of the tibia and the articulation of the knee. Tho external one passes outwards above the head of the fibula, to the front of tho knee-joint, lying in its course beneath the outer head of the Gastrocnemins, the external lateral ligament, and the tendon of the Biceps muscle, and divides into branches, which anastomose with the inferior internal articular artery, the superior ai'ticular arteries, and the recurrent bi-anch of the anterior tibial. Antekiok Tibial Aetery. (Fig. 233.) The anterior tibial artery commences at the bifurcation of the popliteal, at the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, passes forwards between th,e two heads of the Tibialis posticus, and through the aperture left between the bones at the upper part of the interosseous membrane, to the deep part of the front of the leg ; it then descends on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, and of the tibia, to the front of the ankle-joint, where it lies more superficially, and becomes the dorsalis pedis. A line drawn from the inner side of the head of the fibula to midway between the two malleoli will mark the course of the artery. Eelatiuns. In the upper two-thirds of its extent, it rests upon the interosseous membrane, to which it is connected by delicate fibrous arches thrown across it. In the lower third, upon the front of the tibia, and the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint. In the upper third of its course, it lies between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum; in the middle third, between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor proprius pollicis. In the lower third, it is crossed by the tendon of the Extensor proprius pollicis, and lies between it and the innermost tendon of the Extensor longus digitorum. It is covered, in the upper two-thirds of its course, by the muscles which lie on either side of it, and by the deep fascia; in the lower third, by the integument, annular ligament, and fascia. The anterior tibial artery is accompanied by two veins .(vense comites), which lie one on either side of the artery; the anterior tibial nerve lies at first to its outer side, and about the middle of the leg is placed superficial to it; at the lower part of the artery the nerve is genei'ally again on the outer side.

The anterior tibial artery may be tied in the upper or lower par of the leg. In the upmsr part, the operation is attended with great dillicuUy on account ot the deptb of the vessel from tlie surface. An incision, about four inches in length, should be- made through the integument, midway between tlie .spine of the tibia and the outer margin of the fibula, the fascia and intermuscular si'plum between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum being divided to the same extent. The foot must be Hexed to relax these muscles, and they must be separated from each other by the finger. The artery is then exposed, deeply seated, lying upon the interosseous membrane, the nerve lying externally, and one of the vena) coiuites on either side; these must be separated from the artery before the aneurism needle is passed round it. ' To tie the vessel in the lower third of the leg above the ankle-joint, an incision about three inches in length should be made through the integument between the tendons of tlie Tibialis anticus and Extensor proprius pollicis muscles, the deep i'ascia being divided to tiie same extent; the tendon on either side shoidd be held aside, when the vessel will be seen lying upon the tibia, with the nerve superficial to it, and one of the vena) comites on either side. In order to secure the artery over the instep, an incision should be made on the fibular side of the tendon of the Extensor proprius pollicis, hetween it and the innermost tendon of the long Extensor; the deep fascia having been divided, the artery will be exposed, the nerve lying either superficial to it, or to its outer side. The branches of the anterior tibial artery are, the Recurrent tibial. Internal malleolar. Muscular. External malleolar. The recurrent hrancJi arises from the anterior tibial, as soon as that vessel has passed through the interosseous space ; it ascends in the Tibialis anticus muscle, and ramifies on the front and sides of the knee-joint, anastomosing with the articu- lar branches of the popliteal. The muscular branches are numerous ; they are distributed to the muscles which lie on either side of the vessel, some piercing the deep fascia to supply the in- tegument, others passing through the interosseous membrane, and anastomosing with branches of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries. The malleolar arteries supply the ankle-joint. The internal arises about two inches above the articulation, and passes beneath the tendon of the Tibialis anticus to the inner ankle, upon which it ramifies, anastomosing with branches of the posterior tibial and internal plantar arteries. The external passes beneath the tendons of the Extensor longus digitorum and Extensor proprius pollicis, and sup- plies the outer ankle, anastomosing with the anterior peroneal artery, and with ascending branches from the tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis. DoESALis Pedis Aktert. (Pig. 233.) The dorsahs pedis, the continuation of the anterior tibial, passes forwards from the bend of the ankle along the tibial side of the foot to the back part of the first interosseous space, where it divides into two branches, the dorsalis hallucis and communicating. Relations. This vessel, in its course forwards, rests upon the astragalus, sca- phoid, and internal cuneiform bones and the ligaments connecting them, being covered by the integument and fascia, and crossed near its termination by the innei° most tendon of the Extensor brevis digitorum. On its tibial side is the tendon of the Extensor proprius pollicis ; on its fibular side, the innermost tendon of the Ex- tensor longus digitorum, and the termination of the anterior tibial nerve.

Peculiarities in Size. The dorsal artery of the foot may be larger than usual, to compensate for a deticient plantar artery; or it may be deficient in its terminal branches to the toes, which are then derived from the internal plantar; or its place may be supplied altogether by a large anterior peroneal artery. Posiiiun. This artery frequently curves outwards, lying external to the line between the middle of the ankle and the back part of the first interosseous space. Surgical Anatomy. This artery may be tied, by making an incision through the integu- ment, between two and three inches ia length, on the fibular side of the tendon of the Extensor proprius pollicis, in the interval between it and the inner border of the short Extensor muscle. The incision should not extend further forwards than the back part_ of the first interosseous space, as the artery divides in that situation. The deep fascia being divided to the same extent, the artery will be exposed, the nerve lying upon ite outer sid«. Brandies. The branches of the dorsalis pedis are, the Tarsal. Dorsalis pollicis, or hallticis. Metatarsal. Communicating. Interosseous. The tarsal artery arises from the dorsalis pedis, as that vessel crosses the scaphoid bone; it passes in an arched direction outwards, lying upon the tarsal bones, and covered by the Extensor brevis digitorum; it supplies that muscle and the articulations of the tarsus, and anastomoses with branches from the metatarsal, external malleolar, peroneal, and external plantar arteries. The metatarsal arises a little anterior to the preceding ; it passes outwards to the outer part of the foot, over the bases of the metatarsal bones, beneath the tendons of the short Extensor, its direction being influenced by its point of origin ; and it anastomoses with the tarsal and external plantar arteries. This vessel gives off three branches, the interosseous, which pass forwards upon the three outer Dorsal interossei muscles, and, in the clefts between the toes, divide into two dorsal collateral branches for the adjoining toes. At the back part of each interosseous space these vessels receive the posterior perforating branches from the plantar arch ; and at the fore part of each interosseous space, they are joined by the anterior perforating branches, from the digital arteries. The outer- most interosseous artery gives off a branch which supplies the outer side of the little toe. The dorsalis hallucis runs forwards along the outer border of the first meta- tarsal bone, and, at the cleft between the first and second toes, divides mto two branches, one of which passes inwards, beneath the tendon of the Extonsor proprius pollicis, and is distributed to the inner border of the great toe ; the other branch bifurcating to supply the adjoining sides of the great and second toes. The comnmnicaiing artery dips down into the sole of the foot, between the two heads of the first Dorsal interosseous muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the external planiar artery, to complete the plantar arch. It here gives ofl two421 POSTERIOR TIBIAL. digital branches; one rnns along the inner side of the groat toe, on its plan ar surface ; the other passes forwards along the first metatarsal space, and bifm-cates for the supply of the adjacent sides of the groat and second toes. Posterior Tibial Artery. (Fig. 232.) The posterior tibial is an artery of large size, which extends obliquely down- wards from the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, along the tibial side of the leg, to the fossa between the inner ankle and the heel, where it divides beneath the origin of the Abductor pollicis, into the internal and external plantar arteries. At its origin it lies opposite the interval between the tibia and fibula; as it descends, it approaches the inner side of the leg, lying behind the tibia, and, m the lower part of its course, is situated midway between the inner malleolus and the tuberosity of the os calcis. Relations. It lies successively upon the Tibialis posticus, the Flexor longus digitorum, the tibia and the back part of the ankle-joint. It is covered by the intermuscular fascia, which separates it above from the Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles. In the lower third, where it is more superficial, ii is covered only by the integument and fascia, and runs parallel with the inner border of the tendo AchiUis. It is accompanied by two veins, and by the posterior tibial nerve, which, lies at first to the inner side of the artery, but soon crosses it, and is, in the greater part of its course, on its outer side.

Exterior to these is the posterior tibial artery, having a vein on either side ; and, still more externally, the posterior tibial nerve. About half an inch nearer the heel is the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis. Peculiarities in Size. The posterior tibial is not unfrequently smaller than usual or absent, its place being supplied by a large peroneal artery, which passes inwards at 'the lower end of the tibia, and either joins the smaU tibial artery, or continues alone to the sole of the foot. ^ Surgical Anatomy. The application of a ligature to the posterior tibial may be required in cases of wound ot the sole of the foot, attended with great htemorrhage, when the vessel should be tied at the inner ankle. In cases of wound of the posterior tibial, it will be necessary to enlarge the wound so as to expose the vessel at the wounded point, excepting where the vessel is injured by a punctured wound from the front of the leg In cases of f"" ^?^-''^''''^the ai-tery low down, the vessel should be tied in the middle femoral artei-^ m aneunsm of the posterior tibial high up, it would be better to tie the fl, Jrtil'./lT'*t"°f ^/'^''"^I'^t'-y^t the ankle, a semilunar incision should be made through tl. TT mil inches and a half in length, midway between tbo heel and inner ankle, or a little nearer the latter. The subcutaneous cellular membrane having been422 divided, a strong and dense fascia, the internal annular ligament, is exposed. This ligament is continuous ahove with the deep fascia of the leg, covers the vessels and nerves, and is intimately adherent to tlie sheaths of the tendons. This having been cautiously divided upon a director, tlie slieath of the vessels is exposed, and being opened, the artery is seen with one of the vena? comites on eacli side. The aneurism needle should be passed round the vessel from the heel towards the ankle, in order to avoid the posterior tibial nerve, care being at the same time talcen not to include the vence comites. The vessel may also be tied in the lower tiiird of the leg by making an incision about thi-ee inches in length, parallel with the inner margin of the tendo Achillis. The internal saphenous vein being carefully avoided, the two layers of fascia must be divided upon a director, when the artery is exposed along the outer margin of the Flexor longus digitorum, with one of its venio comites on either side, and the nerve lying external to it. To tie tiie posterior tibial in the middle of the log is a very difficult operation, on account of tlie great depth of tlie vessel from the surface, and its being covered by the Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles. The patient being placed in the recumbent position, the injured limb should rest on its outer side, the knee being partially bent, and the foot extended, so as to relax the muscles of the calf. An incision about four inches in length should then bo made through the integument, along the inner margin of the tibia, taking care to avoid the internal saphenous vein. The deep fascia having been divided, the margin of the G.as- trocnemius is exposed, and must be drawn aside, and the tibial attachment of the Soleus divided, a director being previously passed beneath it. The artery may now be felt pul- sating beneath the deep I'ascia, about a'n inch from the margin of the tibia. The fa.scia having been divided, and the limb placed in such a position as to relax the muscles of the calf as much as possible, the veins should be separated from the artery, and the aneurism needle passed round the vessel from without inwards, so as to avoid wounding the posterior tibial nerve. The branches of the posterior tibial artery are, the Peroneal. Nutrient. Anterior peroneal. Communicating. Muscular. Internal calcanean. The Peroneal Arteri/ lies, deeply seated, along the back part of the fibular side of the leg. It arises from the posterior tibial, about an inch below the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, passes obliquely outwards to the fibula, and then desoends along the inner border of that bone to the lower third of the leg, where it gives off the anterior peroneal. It then passes across the articulation between the tibia and fibula, to the outer side of the os calcis, supplying the neighbouring muscles and back of the ankle, and anastomosing with the external malleolar, tarsal, and external plantar arteries. B<datn)n.t. This vessel rests at first upon the Tibialis posticus, and, in the greater part of its course, in the fibres of the Plexor longus polUcis, in a groove between the interosseous membrane and the bone. It is covered in the upper part of its course by the Soleus and deep fascia; helow, by the Flexor longus polUcis. Plan of the Relations of the Peroneal Aetery. In front. Tibialis posticus.

If^ Size is more frequently increased than diminished; and then it either reinforces the posterior tibial by its junction with it, or altogether takes the place of the posterior tihinl in the lower part of the leg and foot, the latter vessel only existing as a short muscular branch.

The peroneal avteiy, in its course, gives off branches to the Soleus, Tibialis posticus, Flexor longus pollicis, and Peronei nxuscles, and a nutrient branch to the fibula. , , . The Anterior Peroneal, the only named branch of the peroneal artery pierces the interosseous membrane, about two inches above tbe outer malleolus, to reach the fore part of the leg, and, passing down beneath the Peroneus tertius, to the outer ankle, ramifies on the front and outer side of the tarsus, anastomosing with the external malleolar and tarsal arteries. ... The nutrient artery of the tibia arises from the posterior tibial near its origin, and after supplying a few muscular branches, enters the nutrient canal of that bone, which it traverses obliquely from above downwards. This is the largest nutrient artery of bone in the body. The muscular branches of the posterior tibial are distributed to the Soleus and deep muscles along the back of the leg. The communicatincj branch to the peroneal runs transversely across the back of the tibia, about two inches above its lower end, passing beneath the Flexor longus pollicis. The infernal calcanean are several large arteries, which arise from the pos- terior tibial just before its division; they are distributed to the fat and integu- ment behind the tendo Achillis and about the heel, and to the muscles on the inner side of the sole, anastomosing with the peroneal and internal malleolar arteries. The Internal Plantar Artery (figs. 234, 235), much smaller than the external, passes forwards along the inner side of the foot. It is at first situated above the Abductor pollicis, and then between it and the Flexor brevis digitorum, both of which it supplies. At the base of the first metatarsal bone, where it has become much diminished in size, it passes along the inner border of the great toe, inoscu- lating with its digital branches. The External Plantar Artery, much larger than the internal, passes obliquely outwards and forwards to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. It then turns obliquely inwards to the interval between the bases of the first and second meta- tarsal bones, where it anastomoses with the communicating branch from the dorsalis pedis artery, thus completing the plantar arch. As this artery passes outwards, it is at first placed between the os calcis and Abductor pollicis, and then between the Flexor brevis digitomm and Flexor accessorius ; and as it passes forwards to the base of the little toe, it lies more superficially between the Plexor brevis digitorum, and Abductor minimi digiti, covered by the deep fascia and integument. The remaining portion of the vessel is deeply situated; it extends from the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe to the back part of the first interosseous space, and forms the plantar arch ; it is convex forwards, lies upon the Interossei muscles, opposite the tarsal ends of the metatarsal bones, and is covered by the Adductor pollicis, the flexor tendons of the toes, and the Lumbricales. Branches. The plantar arch, besides distributing numerous branches to the muscles, integument, and fasciaa in the sole, gives ofi" the following branches : Posterior perforating. Digital—Anterior perforating. The Posterior Perforating are three small branches, which ascend through the back part of the three outer interosseous spaces, between the heads of the Dorsal interossei muscles, and anastomose with the interosseous branches from the meta- tarsal artery. The Digital Branches are four in number, and supply the three outer toes and half the second toe. The first passes outwards from the outer side of the plantar424 ARTERIES. arch, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe, passing in its course beneath the Abductor and short Flexor muscles. The second, third, and fourth run forwards along the motatarsul spaces, and on arriving at the clefts between the toes divide into collateral branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the three outer toes and the outer side of the second. At tlic bifarcation of the toes, each digital artery sends upwards, through the fore part of the corresponding metatarsal space, a small branch, which inosculates with the interosseous branches of the metatarsal artery. These are the anterior perforating branches. From the arrangement already described of the distribution of the vessels to the toes, it will be seen that both sides of the three outer toes, and the outer side 234.—The Plantar Arteries.

Jiraiiches of the second toe, are supplied by branches from the plantar arch; both sides of the great toe, and the inner side of the second, being supplied by the dorsalis hallucis. PULMONAET AkTEBY. The pulmonary artery conveys the venous blood from the right side of the hea to the lungs. It is a short wide vessel, about two inches in length, arising from the left side o£ the base of the right ventricle, in front of the aorta. It ascends obliquely upwards, backwards, and to the left side, as far as the under surface of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into two branches of nearly equal size, the right and left pulmonary arteries. Relations. The greater part of this vessel is contained, together with the ascending part of the arch of the aorta, in the pericardium, being enclosed with it in a tube of serous membrane, continued upwards from the base of the heart, and has attached to it, above, the fibrous layer of the membrane. Behind, it rests at first upon the ascending aorta, and higher up lies in front of the left auricle. On either side of its origin is the appendix of the corresponding auricle, and a coronary artery; and higlier up it passes to the left side of the ascending aorta.425 PULMONARY. A little to the left of its point of bifurcation, it is connected to the under surface of the arch of the aorta by a short fibrous cord, the remains of a vessel peculiar to foetal life, the ductus arteriosus. 1 f., -u • j-„ii The right p^ulmonary artery, longer and larger than the left, runs horizontal y outwards, behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava, to the root of the right lung, where it divides into two branches, of which the lower which is the larger, supplies the lower lobe; the upper giving a branch to the middle lobe. . , The left pulmonary arten/, shorter but somewhat smaller than the right, passes horizontally in front of the'descending aorta and left bronchus to the root ot the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes. The terminal branches of the pulmonary artery will be described with the anatomy of the lung. The author has to acknowledge valuable aid derived from the following works:— Harrison's 'Surgicid Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body.' Dublin, 1824.— Richard Quain's * Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body.' London, 1844.—Sibson s 'Medical Anatomy;' and the other works on General and Microscopic Anatomy before referred to.or the Veins. THE Veins are the vessels which serve to return the blood from the capillaries of the different parts of the body to the heat^t. They consist of two distinct ' sets of vessels, the pulmonary and systemic. The P'uhnonary Veins, unlike other vessels of this kind, contain arterial blood, ■whicb they return from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart. The Systemic Veins return the venous blood from the body generally to the right auricle of the heart. The Fortal Vein, an appendage to the systemic venous system, is confined to the abdominal cavity, returning the venous blood fi-om the viscera of digestion, and carrying it to the liver by a single trunk of lai-ge size, the vena portte. From this organ, the same blood is conveyed to the inferior vena cava by means of the hepatic veins. The veins, like the arteries, are found in nearly every tissue of the body. They commence by minute plexuses, which communicate with the capillaries. The branches which have their commencement in those plexuses unite together into trunks, and these, in their passage towards the heart, constantly increase in size as they receive branches, and join other veins similar in size to themselves. The veins are lai'ger and altogether more numerous than the arteries; hence, the entire capacity of the venous system is much greater than that of the arterial; the pul- monary veins excepted, which do not exceed in capacity the pulmonary arteries. From the combined area of the smaller venous branches being greater than the main trunks, it results, that the venous system represents a cone, the summit of which corresponds to the heart: its base to the circumference of the body. In form, the veins are not perfectly cylindrical like the arteries, their walls being collapsed when empty, and the uniformity of their surface being interrupted at intervals by slight contractions, which indicate the existence of valves in their interior. They usually retain, however, the same calibre as long as they receive no branches. The veins communicate very freely with one another, especially in certain regions of the body ; and this communication exists between the larger trunks as well as between the smaller branches. Thus, in the cavity of the cranium, and between the veins of the neck, where obstruction would be attended with imminent danger to the cerebral venous system, we find that the sinuses and larger veins have large and very frequent anastomoses. The same free communication exists between the veins throughout the whole extent of the spinal canal, and between the veins composing the various venous plexuses in the abdomen and pelvis, as the spermatic, uterine, vesical, prostatic, etc. The veins are subdivided into three sets: superficial, deep, and sinuses. The Superficial or Ototaneoios Veins are found between the layers of superficial fascia, immediately beneath the integument; they return the blood from these structures and communicate with the deep veins by perforating the deep fascia. j • i The Deep Veins accompany the arteries, and are usually enclosed m the same sheath with those vessels. In the smaller arteries, as the radial, ulnar, brachial, tibial, peroneal, they exist generally in pairs, one lying on each side of the vessel, and are called vencB comites. The larger ai-teries, as the axillary, subclavian, popliteal, and femoral, have usually only one accompanying vein. In certain organs of the body, however, the deep veins do not accompany the arteries ; forOF THE HEAD AND NECK. 427 instance, the veins in the skull and spinal canal, the hepatic veins-in the liver, and ^ the larger veins returning blood from the osseous tissue. ^ ^ Shmses are venous channels, which, in their structure and mode of distribution difler altogether from the veins. They are found only in the interior of the skull, and are formed by a separation of the layers of the dura mater ; their outer coat consisting of fibrous tissue, their inner of a serous membrane continuous with the serous membrane of the veins. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, the difference in thickness being due to the small amount of elastic and muscular tissues which the veins contain. The superficial veins usually have thicker coats than the deep veins, and the veins of the lower limb are thicker than those of the upper. * The minute structure of these vessels is described in the Introduction. The veins maybe arranged into three groups :—i. Those of the head and neck, upper extremity, and thorax, which terminate in the superior vena cava. 2. Those of the lower limb, pelvis, and abdomen, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. 3. The cardiac veins, which open directly into the right auncle of the heart. Veins op the Head and Neck. The veins of the head and neck may be subdivided into three groups :—i. The veins of the exterior of the head. 2. The veins of the neck. 3. The veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium. The veins of the exterior of the head are, the * Facial. Temporo-maxillary. Temporal. Posterior auricular. Internal maxillary. Occipital. The Facial Vein passes obliquely across the side of the face, extending from the inner angle of the orbit, downwards and outwards, to the anterior margin of the Masseter muscle. It lies to the outer side of the facial artery, and is not so tortuous as that vessel. It commences in the frontal region, where it is called the frontal vein ; at the inner angle of the eye it has received the name of the angular vein ; and from this point to its termination is called the facial vein. The frontal -yem commences on the anterior part of the skull, by a venous plexus, which communicates with the anterior branches of the temporal vein ; the veins converge to form a single trunk, which runs downwards near the middle line of the forehead parallel with the vein of the opposite side, and unites with it at the root of the nose, by a transverse trunk, called the nasal arch. Occasionally, the frontal veins join to form a single trunk, which bifurcates at the root of the nose into the two angular veins. At the nasal arch the branches diverge, and run along the side of the root of the nose. The frontal vein as it descends upon the forehead receives the supraorbital vein; the dorsal veins of the nose terminate in the nasal arch; and the angular vein receives the veins of the ala nasi on its inner side, and the superior palpebral veins on its outer side ; it moreover communicates with the ophthalmic vein, which establishes an important anastomosis between this vessel and the cavernous sinus. The facial vein commences at the inner angle of the orbit, being a continuation of the angular vein. It passes obliquely downwards and outwards, beneath the Zygomaticus major muscle, descends along the anterior border of the Masseter crosses over the body of the lower jaw, with the facial artery, and, passing obhquely outwards and backwards, beneath the Platysma and cervical fascia, unites with a branch of communication from the temporo-maxillary vein, to form la trunk of large size which enters the internal jugular. Branches. The facial vein receives, near 'the angle of the mouth, communi- •eating branches from the pterygoid plexus. It is also joined by the inferiorYKINS. 428 palpebral, tho superior and inferior labial veins, the buccal veins from the cheek, and the masseteric veins. Bolovv tlie jaw it receives the submental, the mferior palatine, which returns the blood from the plexus around the tonsil and soft palate ; the submaxillary vein, which commences in the submaxillary gland ; and lastly, the ranine vein. 236.—Veins of the Head and Neck.

Ani/u/at 'Superior Thyrei^ The Temporal Vein commences by a minute plexus on the side and vertex 0^ the skull, which communicates with the frontal vein in front, the correspondiug vein of the opposite side, and the posterior auricular and occipital veins From this network, anterior and posterior branches are formed which unite abo the zygoma, forming the trunk of the vein. This trunk is joined ni this situation by a large vein, the middle temporal, which receives the blood from the substanc^ of the Temporal muscle and pierces the fascia at the upper border of the zygom The temporal vein then descends between the external auditory meatus and 11 .dyle of the jaw, enters the substance of the parotid gland, and umtes witu lu con internal maxillary vein, to form the temporo-maxillary.OF THE NECK. t lace. Branches. The temporal vein receives in its course some parotid vems, an •ticular branch from the articulation of the jaw, anterior auricular veins from ,0 external ear, and a vein of large size, the transverse facial, from the side of the The Internal Ma^xillanj Vein is a vessel of considerable size, receiving branches svhich correspond with those of the internal maxillary artery. Thus it receives tlio middle meningeal veins, the deep temporal, the pterygoid, masseteric, and l,uccal, some palatine veins, and the inferior dental. These branches form a kiro-e plexus, the pterygoid, which is placed between the Temporal and JLxternal pterygoid, and partly between the Pterygoid muscles. This plexus communicates very freely with the facial vein, and with the cavernous sinus, by branches through the base of the skull. The trunk of the vein then passes backwards, behind the neck of the lower jaw, and unites with the temporal vein, forming the temporo-maxillary. The Temporo-Maxillarij Vein, formed by the union of the temporal and internal maxillaiy vein, descends in the substance of the parotid gland, between the ramus of the jaw and the Sterno-mastoid muscle, and divides into. two branches, one of which passes inwards to join the facial vein, the other is continuous with the external jugular. It receives near its termination the posterior auricular vein. The Posterior Auricular Vein commences upon the side of the head, by a plexus which communicates with the branches of the temporal and occipital veins. The vein descends behind the external ear and joins the temporo-maxillary, just before that vessel terminates in the external jugular. This vessel receives the stylo-mastoid vein, and some branches from the back part of the external ear. The Occipital Vein commences at the back part of the vertex of the skull, by a plexus in a similar manner with the other veins. It follows the course of the occipital artery, passing deeply beneath the muscles of the back part of the neck, and terminates in the internal jugular, occasionally in the external jugular. As this vein passes opposite the mastoid process, it receives the mastoid vein, which establishes a communication with the lateral sinus. Veins of the Neck. The veins of the neck, which return the blood from the head and face, are the External jugular. Anterior jugular. Posterior external jugular. ' Internal jugular. Vertebral. The External Jugular Vein receives the greater part of the blood from the exterior of the cranium and deep parts of the face, being a continuation of the temporo-maxillary and posterior auricular veins. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, on a level with the angle of the lower jaw, and runs perpen- dicularly down the neck, in the direction of a Hne drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle. In its course it crosses the Sterno-mastoid muscle, and runs parallel with its posterior border as far as its attachment to the clavicle, where it perforates the deep fascia, and terminates in the subclavian vein, on the outer side of the internal jugular. In the neck, it is separated from the Sterno-mastoid by the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia, and is covered by the Platysma, the superficial fascia, and the integument This vein is crossed about its middle by the superficial cervical nerve, and its upper half is accompanied by the auno.ularis magnus nerve. The external jugular vein varies in size, bearing an inverse proportion to tliat of the other veins of the neck ; it is occasionally double. It is provided with two pairs of valves, the lower pair being placed at its entrance mto ti.e subclavian vein, the upper pair in most cases aboutVEINS. 430 ail inch and a half above the daviclo. Those valves do not prevent the regurgita- tion of the blood, or the passage of injection from below upwards.* Urauches. This voiu receives the occipital occasionally, the posterior external jugular, and, near its termination, the suprascapular and transverse cervical veins. It communicates with the anterior jugular, and, in the sub.stance of the parotid, receives a large bi-anch of communication I'rora the internal jugular. The Toslorior External Jugular Vein returns the blood from the integument and superficial muscles in the upper and back part of the neck, lying between! the Splenius and Trapezius muscles. It runs down the back part of the neck, and! opens into the external jugular just below the middle of its course. ; The Anterior Jugular Vein collects the blood from the integument and muscles in the middle of the anterior region of the neck. It passes down between the. median lino and the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, and, at the lower part of the neck, passes beneath that muscle to open into the termination of the external jugular, or into the subclavian vein (fig. 241). This vein varies con- siderably in size, bearing almost always an inverse propoi-tion to the external jugular. Most frequently there are two anterior jugulars, a right and left; but occasionally only one. This vein receives some laryngeal branches, and occasion- ally an inferior thyroid vein. Just above the sternum, the two anterior" jugular veins communicate by a transverse trunk, which receives branches from the inferior thyroid veins. It also communicates with the external and with the internal jugular. There are no valves in this vein. The Internal Jugular Vein collects the blood from the interior of the cranium,' from the superficial parts of the face, and from the neck. It commences at the jugular foramen, in the base of the skull, being formed by the coalescence of the lateral and inferior petrosal sinuses. At its origin it is somewhat dilated, and this dilatation is called the sinus, or gulf of the internal jugular vein. It runs down' the side of the neck in a vertical direction, lying at first on the outer side of the, internal carotid, and then on the outer side of the common carotid, and at th root of the neck unites with the subclavian vein, to form the vena innominata. The internal jugular vein, at its commencement, lies upon the Rectus lateralis, behind, and at the outer side of the internal carotid, and the eighth and ninth pairs of nerves ; lower down, the vein and artery lie upon the tame plane, the glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves passing forwards between them ; the pneumogastric descends between and behind them, in the same sheath ; and the spinal accessory passes obliquely outwards, behind the vein. At the root of the neck the vein of the right side is placed at a little distance from the artery; on the left side, it usually crosses it at its lower part. The right internal jugular vein crosses the first part of the subclavian artery. This vein is pf considerable size, but varies in different individuals, the left one being usually the smaller. It is provided with a pair of valves, which are placed at its point of termination, or from half to three quarters of an inch above it. Brandies. This vein receives in its course the facial, lingual, pharyngeal, superior and middle thyroid veins, and sometimes the occipital. At its point of junction with the branch common to the temporal and facial veins, it becomes greatly increased in size. The lingual veins commence on the dorsum, sides, and under surface of the tongue, and passing backwards, following the course of the lingual artery and its branches, terminate in the internal jugular. The loliaryngeal vein commences in a mumte plexus, the pharyngeal, at the back part and sides of the pharynx, and after receiving meningeal branches, and the Vidian and spheno-palatine veins, terminate in the internal jugular. It occasionally opens into the facial, lingual, or superior thyroid vein. * The student may refer to nn iuterestinf^ paper by Dr. Strutbers, ' On Jugular Vt'iu'- sectinn in Asphyxia, "Auatouiically and Experiuienlally Considered, includin<r tlie Demon- .«tratiou of Valves iu tlio Veins of the Neck,' in the Edinburyh AMicn/ Journal, tor Js'ovetnber, 1856.OF THE DIPLOlfi. 431 Tlie svpcrhr fh/nml vcm commences in the substance and on tho surface of the .hyvoid -land, by" branches corresponding with those of the superior thyroid artery, and terminates in the upper part of the internal jugular vein The muMc thyroid vein collects the blood from the lower part of the lateral lobe .r the thyroid gland, and, being joined by some branches from the larynx and trachea, terminates in tho lower part of tho internal jugular vein. The occipital vein has been described above. The Vertebral Vein commences in the occipital region, by numerous small branches, from the deep muscles at the upper and back part of tlie neck, passes outwards, and enters the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, and descends by the side of the vertebral artery, in the canal formed by the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. Emerging from the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical, it terminates at the root of the neck in the back part of the innominate vein near its origin, its mouth being guarded by a pair of valves. On the right side, it crosses the first part of the subclavian artery. This vein, in the lower part of its course, occasionally divides into two branches, one of •which, emerges with the artery at the sixth cervical vertebra : the other escapes through the foramen in the seventh cervical. Branches.- The vertebral vein receives in its course the posterior condyloid vein, muscular branches from the muscles in the prevertebral region ; dorsi-spinal veins, from the back part of the cervical portion of the spine; meningo-rachidian veins, from the interior of the spinal canal; and lastly, the ascending and deep cervical veins. Veins of the Diplob. The diploe of the cranial bones is channelled, in the adult, by a number oi tortuous canals, which are lined by a more or less complete layer of compact 237.—Veins of thi Diploe, as displayed by the Removal of the Outer Table of the Skull. tissue. The veins they contain are large and capacious, their walls being thin, and formed only of epithelium, resting upon a layer of elastic tissue, and they present, at irregular intervals, pouch-like dilatations, or cuU de sac, which serve432 VEINS. as reservoii'S for the blood. These are the veins of the diploii: they can only be displayed by removing the outer table of the skull. In adult life, as long as the cranial bones are distinct and separable, these veins are confined to the particular bones ; but in old age, w^hen the sutures are united, they communicate with each other, and increase in size. These vessels commu- nicate," in the interior of the cranium, with the meningeal veins, and with the sinuses of the dura mater; and on the exterior of the skull, with the veins of the pericranium. They are divided into the frontal, which opens into the eupraorljital vein, by an aperture at the supraorbital notch; the anterior temjx/ral, which is confined chiefly to the frontal bone, and opens into one of the deep temporal veins, after escaping by an aperture in the great wing of the sphenoid; the postenor temporal, which is confined to the parietal bone, and terminates in the lateral sinus by an aperture at the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone ; and the occvpital, which is confined to the occipital bone and opens either into the occipital vein, or the occipital sinus. Ceregral Veins. The Oerehral Veins are remarkable for the extreme thinness of their coats, in consequence of the muscular tissue in them being wanting, and for the absence of valves. They may be divided into two sets, the superficial, which are placed on the surface, and the deep veins, which occupy the interior of the organ. The Superior Cerebral Veins ramify upon the surface of the brain, being lodged in the sulci, between the convolutions, a few running across the convolu- tions. They receive branches from the substance of the brain, and terminate in the sinuses. They are named, from the position they occupy, superior, inferior, internal, and external. The Superior Cerebral Veins, seven or eight in number on each side, pass forwards and inwards towards the great longitudinal fissure, where they receive the internal cerebral veins, which return the blood from the convolutions of the flat surface of the corresponding hemisphere; near their termination, they become invested with a tubular sheath of the arachnoid membrane, and open into the superior longitudinal sinus, in the opposite' direction to the course of the blood. The Inferior Anterior Cerebral Veins commence on the under surface of the anterior lobes of the brain, and terminate in the cavernous sinuses. The Inferior Lateral Cerebral Veins commence on the lateral parts of the hemispheres, and at the base of the brain : they unite to form from three to five veins, which open into the lateral sinus from before backwards. The Inferior Median Cerebral Veins, which are very large, commence at the fore part of the under surface of the cerebrum, and from the convolutions of the posterior lobe, and terminate in the straight sinus behind the venffi Galeni. The Veep Cerebral, or Ventricular Veins (vena) Galeni), are two in number, one from the right, the other from the left, ventricle. They are each formed by two veins, the vena corporis striati, and the choroid vein. They run backwards, parallel with one another, enclosed within the velum interpositum, and pass out of the brain at the great transverse fissure, between the under surface of the corpus callosum and the tubercula quadrigemina, to enter the straight sinus. The vena corporis striati commences in the groove between the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, receives numerous veins from both of these parts, and unites behind the anterior pillar of the fornix with the choroid vein, to form one of the vence Galeni. ., The choroid vein runs along the whole length-of the outer border of the clioroia plexus, receiving veins from the hippocampus major, the fornix and corpus callosum and unites, at the anterior extremity of the choroid plexus, with the vein of the corpus striatum.433 SINUSES OP THE DURA MATER. The Oerehellar Veins occupy the snrfaco of the cerebellum, and are disposed in three sets, superior, inferior, and lateral. The superior pass forwards and inwai-ds, across the superior vorraiform process, aud terminate in the straight sinus: some open into the vente Galeni. The Inferior cerebellar veins, of large size, run transversely outwards, and terminate by two or three trunks in the lateral sinuses. The lateral anterior cerebellar veins terminate in the superior petrosal sinuses. Sinuses of the Dura Matee. The sinuses of the dura mater are venous channels, analogous to the veins, their outer coat being formed by the dura mater ; their inner, by a continuation of the serous membrane of the veins. They are fifteen in number, and are divided into two sets :—i. Those situated at the upper and back part of the skull 2. Those at the base of the skull. The former are the Superior longitudinal. Inferior longitudinal. Occipital sinuses. Straight sinus. Lateral sinnses. The Superior Longihidmal Sinus occupies the attached margin of the falx cerebri. Commencing at the crista Galli, it rujis from before backwards, groov- 238.—Vertical Section of the Skull, showing the Sinuses of the Dura Mater. Torru/ar \ .

This sinus is triangular in form, narrow m front, and gradually mcreasing in size as it passes backwards. On examining Its inner surface it presents the internal openings of the cerebral veins, which run, for the most part, from behmd forwards, and open chiefly at the back part of the sinus, then; orifices bemg concealed by fibrous areola; numerous fibrous bands {cUrda.

F F434 VEINS. The point where the superior longitudinal and lateral sinuses are continuous is called the conftuence of the sinuses, or the iorcular EerojjMU. It presents a considerable dilatation, of very irregular form, and is the point of meeting of six sinuses, the superior longitudinal, the two lateral, the two occipital, and the straight. The Infenor Longitudinal Sviius, more correctly described as the vnferior longi- tudinal vein, is contained in the posterior part of the free margin of the falx cerebi*i. It is of a circular form, increases in size as it passes backwards, and terminates in the straio-ht sinus. It receives several veins from the falx cerebri, and occasionally a few from the fl^-t surface of the hemispheres. The Straight Sinus is situated at the line of junction of the falx cerebri with the tentox'ium. It is triangular in form, increases in size as it proceeds backwards, and runs obliquely downwards and backwards from the termination of the inferior longitudinal sinus to the torcular Herophili. Besides the inferior longitudinal sinus, it receives the vense Galeni, the inferior median cerebral veins, and the superior cerebellar. A few transverse bands cross its interior. The Lateral Sinuses are of large size, and are situated in the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli. They commence at the torcular Herophili, and passing horizontally outwards to the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, curve downwards and inwards on each side to reach the jugular foramen, where they terminate in the internal jugular vein. Each sinus rests in its course, upon the inner surface of the occipital, the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, the mastoid portion of the temporal, and on the occipital again just before its ter- mination. These sinuses are frequently of unequal size, and they increase in size as they proceed from behind forwards. The horizontal portion is of a triangular form, the curved portion semi-cylindrical; their inner surface is smooth, and not crossed by the fibrous bands found in the other sinuses. These sinuses receive blood from the superior longitudinal, the straight, and the occipital sinuses; and in front they communicate with the superior and inferior petrosal. They com- municate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and posterior condyloid veins, and they receive the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diploe. The Occipital are the smallest of the cranial sinuses. They are usually two in number, and situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebelli. They commence by several small veins around the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, which communicate with the posterior spinal veins, and terminate by separate openings (sometimes by a single aperture) in the torcular Herophili. The sinuses at the base of the skull are the Cavernous. Inferior petrosal. Circular. Superior petrosal. Transverse. The Cavernous Sinuses are named from their presenting a reticulated structure. They are two in number, of large size, and placed one on each side of the sella Turcica, extending from the sphenoidal fissure to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; they receive anteriorly the ophthaknic vein thi-ough the sphenoidal fissure, and communicate behind with the petrosal sinuses, and with each other by the circular and transverse sinuses. On the inner wall of each sinus is found the internal carotid artery, accompanied by filaments of the carotid plexus and by the sixth nerve ; and on its outer wall, the third, fourth, and ophthahmo nerves. These parts are separated from the blood flowing along the sums by the lining membrane, which is continuous with the outer coat of the vems. The cavity of the sinus, which is larger behind than in front, is intersected by filaments of fibrous tissue and small vessels. The cavernous sinuses receive the mfenor anterior cerebral veins ; they communicate with the lateral sinuses by means of the superior and inferior petrosal, and with the facial vein through the ophthalmic.SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 435 The opUhalmic is a large vein, wliicli connects the frontal vein at the inner angle of the orbit with the cavernous sinus ; it pursues the same course as the ophthalmic artery, and receives branches corresponding to those derived from that vessel. Forming a short single trunk, it passes through the inner extremity ot the sphenoidal fissure, and terminates in the cavernous sinus, 239.—The Sinuses at the Base of the Skull. 0j3£'ning of* jiTas^oid Vein The Circular Sinus completely surrounds the pituitary body, and communicates on each side with the cavernous sinuses. Its posterior half is larger than the anterior ; and in old age it is more capacious than at an early period of life. It receives veins from the pituitary body, and from the adjacent bone and dura mater. The Inferior Petrosal Sinus is situated in the groove formed by the junction of the inferior border of the petrous portion of the temporal with the basilar process of the occipital. It commences in front at the termination of the cavernous sinus, and opens behind into the jugular foramen, forming with the lateral sinus the commencement of the internal jugular vein. These sinuses are semi-cylindrical in form. The Transverse Sinus is placed transversely across the fore part of the basilar process of the occipital bone serving to connect the two inferior petrosal and cavernous sinuses. A second is occasionally found opposite the foramen magnum. The Stiperior Petrosal Sinus is situated along the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, in the front part of the attached margin of the ten- torium. It is small and narrow, and connects together the cavernous and lateral sinuses at each side. It receives a cerebral vein (inferior lateral cerebral) from the under part of the middle lobe, a cerebellar vein (anterior lateral cerebellar) from the anterior border of the cerebellum, and a vein from the internal eai-. r r 2VEINS. 436 VEINS OP THE UPPER EXTEEMITY. The veins of the upper extremity are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. ^ The Superficial Veins are placed immediately beneath the integument between the two layers of superficial fascia; they commence in the hand chiefly on its dorsal aspect, where they form a more or less complete arch. The Deej} Veins accompany the arteries, and constitute the vena3 comites of those vessels. Both sets of vessels are provided with valves, -which are more numerous in the deep than in the superficial. The superficial veins of the upper extremity are the 240.—Tho Suporficial Vehis of the LIppor Extreiuity. Anterior ulnar. Posterior ulnar. Basilic. Radial. Cephalic. Median. Median basilic. Median cephalic. The Anterior Ulnar Vein commences on the anterior surface of the ulnar side of the hand and wrist, and ascends along the inner side of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, where it ioins with, the posterior ulnar vein to form 'I ^ ^ . , •■11 1 HeltattCrjihalic, the basilic. It communicates with branches of the median vein in front, and with the posterior ulnar behind. The Posterior Ulnar Vein commences on the posterior surface of the ulnar side of the hand, and from the vein of the little finger (vena salvatella), situated over the fourth metacarpal space. It ascends on the posterior surface of the ulnar side of the fore-arm, and just below the elbow unites witli the anterior ulnar vein to form the basilic. The Basilic is a vein of considerable size, formed by the coalescence of the anterior and posterior ulnar veins ; ascending along the inner side of the elbow, it receives the median basilic vein, and passing upwards along the inner side of the arm, pierces tbe deep fascia, and ascends in the course of the brachial artery, terminating either in one of the vense comites of that vessel, or in the axillary vein. The Badial Vein commences from the dorsal surface of the thumb, index finger, and radial side of the hand, by branches communicating with, tbe vena salvatella, and forming by their union a large vessel, which ascends along the radial side of the fore-arm, and receives numerous branches from both its surfaces. At437 BRANCHES OF AXILLARY. the bend of the ejbow it receives the median cephalic, when it beccmes the cephalic vein. The Cephalic Vein ascends along the outer border of the Biceps muscle, to the upper third of the arm; it then passes in the interval between the Pectorahs major and Deltoid muscles, accompanied by the descending branch of the thoracico-acro- mialis artery and the upper external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, and terminates in the axillary vein just below the clavicle. This vein is occasion- ally connected with the external jugular or subclavian, by a branch which passes from it upwards in front of the clavicle. The Median Vein collects the blood from the superficial structures on the palmar surface of the hand and middle line of the fore-arm, communicating with the anterior ulnar and radial veins. At the bend of the elbow, it receives a branch of communication from the deep veins, accompanying the brachial artery, and divides into two branches, the median cephalic and median basilic, which diverge from each other as they ascend. The Median Gephalic, usually the smaller of the two, passes outwards in the groove between the Supinator long-us and Biceps muscles, and joins with the cephalic vein. The branches ef the external cutaneous nerve pass behind this vessel. The Median Basilic vein passes obliquely inwards, in the groove between the Biceps and Pronator radii teres, and joins with the basilic. This vein passes in front of the brachial artery, from which it is separated by a fibrous expansion (the bicipital fascia) which is given off from the tendon of the Biceps to the fascia covering the Plexor muscles of the fore-arm. Filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve pass in front as well as behind this vessel.* The Beep Veins of the Uppei- Bxtremity follow the course of the arteries, forming their vense comites. They are generally two in number,, one lying on each side of the corresponding artery, and they are connected at intervals by short transverse branches. There are two digital veins,, accompanying each artery along the sides of the fingers; these, uniting at their base, pass along the interosseous spaces in the palm, and terminate in the two superficial palmar veins. Branches from these vessels on the radial side of the hand accompany the superficialis volse, and on the ulnar side terminate in the deep ulnar veins. The. deep ulnar veins, as they pass in front of the wrist, communicate with the interosseous and superficial veins, and unite, at the elbow,, with the deep radial veins, to form the- vense^ comites of the brachial artery. The Literosseoiis Veins acco<mpany the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The anterior, interosseous veins commence in front of the wrist, where they com- municate with the deep radial and ulnar veins ; at the upper pai-t of the fore-ai-m they receive the posterior interosseous, veins, and terminate in th& venae comites of the ulnar artery. The Beep Palmar Veins accompany the deep palmar arch,, being formed by branches which accompany the ramifications of that vessel. They communicate with the superficial palmar veins at the inner side of the hand ^ and on the outer ide terminate in the. vena* comites of the radial artery. At the' wrist, they receive a dorsal and a palmar branch from the thumb, and unite with the deep radial veins. Accompanying the radial artery, these vessels terminate in the venaa comites of the brachial artery. The Brachial Veins are placed one on each side of the brachial artery, reoeivino- branches corrcspondmg with those given ofi" from that vessel; at the lower margin of the axdla they unite with the basilic to form the axillary vein. . nf I ^'•r^^l^^''^ '7^= 'Numerous varietips are ohserved in the disposition of the veins t«f ll^T^-J°'''f'^^ t wanting; but in those cases, its two i^/.^vf °rr'" ^''T^t^ '""'^^^^ '^"^^ tl^« c^rl^'^lic is almost ahvavs IhL lTrl^7^ condition.

The deep veins have numerous anastomoses, not only with pach other, but also with the superficial veins. The AxiLLAUY Vbin is of large size and formed by the continuation upwards . of the basilic vein. It commences at the lower part of the axillary space, increases i in size as it ascends, by receiving branches corresponding with those of the i axillary artery, and terminates immediately beneath the clavicle at the outer mar- gin of the first rib, where it becomes the subclavian vein. This vessel is covered . in front by the Pectoral muscles and costo-coracoid membrane, and lies on the thoracic side of the axillary artery. Opposite the Subscapularis, it is joined by a . large vein, formed by the junction of the venas comites of the brachial; and near • its termination it receives the cephalic vein. This vein is provided with a pair of' valves, opposite the lower border of the Subscapularis muscle; valves are also • found at the termination of the cephalic and subscapular veins. The Subclavian Vein, the continuation of the axillary, extends from the outer • margin of the first rib to the inner end of the sterno-clavicular articulation, where i it unites with the internal jugular, to form the vena innominata. It is in relation, in front, with the clavicle and Subclavius muscle ; behind, with the subclavian artery, from which it is separated internally by the Scalenus anticus and phrenic: nerve. Below, it rests in a depression on the first rib and upon the pleura. Above, it is covered by the cervical fascia and integument. The subclavian vein occasionally rises in the neck to a level with the third part of the subclavian artery, and in two instances has been seen passing with this vessel behind the Scalenus anticus. This vessel is provided with valves about an inch from its termination in the innominate, just external to the entrance of the external jugular vein. Branches. It receives the external and anterior jugular veins and a small branch from the cephalic, outside the Scalenus; and on the inner side of that muscle, the internal jugular vein. The VENiE iNNOMiNATiE (fig. 241) are two large trunks, placed one on each side of the root of the neck, and formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian veins of the corresponding side. The Bight Vena Innominata is a short vessel, about an inch and a half in length, which commences at the inner end of the clavicle, and, passing almost vertically downwards, joins with the left vena innominata just below the cartilage of the first rib, to form the superior vena cava. It Ues superficial and external to the artena innominata ; on its right side the pleura is interposed between it and the apex of the lung. This vein, at its angle of junction with the subclavian, receives the right vertebral vein, and right lymphatic duct; and, lower down, the right internal mammary, right inferior thyroid, and right superior intercostal veins. The Left Vena Innominata, about three inches in length, and larger than the right, passes obUquely from left to right across the upper and front part of the chest, to unite with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the superior vena cava. It is in relation, in front, with the sternal end of the clavicle, the sterno- clavicular articulation, and the first piece of the sternum, from which it jb separated by the Sterno-hyoid and Stemo-thyroid muscles, the thymus gland or its remains, and some loose areolar tissue. Behind, it lies across the roots of the three large arteries arising from the arch of the aorta. This vessel is jomed by the left vertebral, left inferior thyroid, left internal mammary, and the left superior intercostal veins, and occasionally some thymic and pericardiac veins. There are no valves in the vense' innominatse.

The internal mammary veins, two iii number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corres- ponding with those derived from it. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innominate vein. The inferior tlmjroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus, on the thyroid body, communicat- ing with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, behind the Sterno-thyroid muscles, communicating with its fellow by transverse branches, and terminates in the left vena innomi- nata. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right vena innominata, just at its junction with the superior cava. These veins receive tracheal and inferior laryn- geal branches, and are provided with valves at their termination in the innominate veins. The Superior Inter- costal Veins return *the blood from the upper in- tercostal spaces. The ri^lit superior in- tevGosial, much smaller than the left, closely corre- sponds with the superior intercostal arfceiy,. receiv- ing the blood from the first, or first and second inter-440 VKINS, costal spaces, and terminates in the right vena innominata. Sometimes it passes down, and opens into the vena azygos major. The Icfl superior intercostal is always larger than the right, but varies in size in different subjects, being small when the left upper azygos vein is lai-ge, and vice versa. It is usually formed by branches from the two or three upper intercostal spaces, and, passing across the arch of the aorta, terminates in the left vena innominata. The left bronchial vein opens into it. The Superior Vena Cava receives the blood which is conveyed to the heart from the whole of the upper half of the body. It is a shoi-t trunk, varying from two inches and a half to three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two vente innominatas. It commences immediately below the cartilage of the first rib on the right side, and, descending vertically, enters the pericardium about an inch and a half above the heart, and terminates in the upper part of the right auricle.

On its rigid side, with the phrenic nerve and right pleura ; on its lefi side, with the ascending part of the aorta. The portion contained within the pericardium is covered by the serous layer of that membrane, and its anterior three-fourths. It receives the vena azygos major, just before it enters the pericardium, and several small veins from the pericardium and parts in the mediastinum. The superior vena cava has no valves. The Azygos Veins connect together the superior and inferior venae cavae, supplying the place of those vessels in the part of the chest which is occupied by the heart. The larger, or right azygos vein, commences opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra, by a branch from the right lumbar veins ; sometimes by a branch from the renal vein, or from the inferior vena cava. It enters the thorax through the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and passes along the right side of the vertebral column to the third dorsal vertebra, where it arches forward, over the root of the right lung, and terminates in the superior vena cava, just before that vessel enters the pericardium. Whilst passing through the aortic opening of the Diaphragm it lies with the thoracic duct on the right side of the aorta; and m the thorax, it lies upon the intercostal arteries, on the right side of the aorta and thoracic duct, covered by the pleura, . • i . -j xi Branches. It receives nine or ten lower intercostal vems of the right side, the vena azygos minor, several cBsophageal, mediastinal, and vertebral veins; near its termination, the right bronchial vein; and is occasionally connected with the right superior intercostal vein.

The Spinal Veins. The numerous venous plexuses placed upon and within the spine nw>y be arranged into four sets. 1. Those placed on the exterior of the spinal column (the dorsi-spinal veins). 2. Those situated in the interior of the spinal canal, between the vertebrffi and the theca vertobralis (meningo-rachidian veins). 3. The veins of the bodies of the vertebraa. 4. The veins of the spinal cord (medulli-spinal). 1. The Borsi.Spinal Veins commence by small branches, which receivd their blood from the integument of the back of the spine, and from the muscles in the vertebral grooves. They form a complicated network, which surrounds the spinous processes, the laminae, and the transverse and articular processes of all the vertebrae. At the bases of the transverse processes, they communicate, by means of ascending and descending branches, with the veins surrounding the contiguous vertebree, and they join with the veius in the spinal canal by branches which perforate the ligamenta subflava; they terminate in the intervals between the arches of the vertebrae, by joining the vertebral veins in the neck, the intercostal veins in the thorax, and the lumbar and sacral veins in the loins and pelvis. 2. The principal veins contained in the spinal canal are situated between the theca vertebralis and the vertebrae. They consist of two longitudinal plexuses, one of which runs along the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebra throughout the entire length of the spinal canal (anterior longitudinal spinal veins), receiving the veins belonging to the bodies of the vertebrae (venae basis vertebrarum). The other plexus (posterior longitudinal spinal veins) is placed on the inner, or anterior surface of the laminae of the vertebras, and extends also along the entire length of the spinal canal. The Anterior Longitudinal Spinal Veins consist of two large, tortuous, venous canals, which extend along the whole length of the vertebral column, from the foramen magnum to the base of the coccyx, being placed one on each side of the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebras, external to the posterior common ligament. These veins communicate together opposite each vertebra, by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large venae basis verte- brarum, from the interior of the body of each vertebra. The anterior longitudinal spinal veins are least developed in the cervical and sacral regions. They are not of uniform s.ize throughout, being alternately enlarged and constricted. At the intervertebral foramina, they communicate with the dorsi-spiaal veins, and with the vertebral veins in the neck, with the intercostal veins in the dorsal region, and with the lumbar and sacral veins in the corresponding regions. The Posterior Longitudinal Spinal Veins, smaller than the anterior, are situated one on either side, between the inner surface of the laminae and the theca verte- bralis. They communicate (hke the anterior), opposite each vertebra, by transverse trunks ; and with the anterior longitudinal veins, by lateral transverse branches, which pass from behind forwards. These veins, at the intervertebral foramina, join with the dorsi-spinal veins. 3. The Veins of the Bodies of tJie Verlehrm <ven£e basis vertebrarum) emerge from the foramina on their posterior surface, and join the transverse trunk connecting the anterior longitudinal spinal veins. They are contained in large tortuous channels, in the substance of the bones, similar in every respect to those found m the diploe of the cranial bones. These canals lie parallel to the upper and lower surface of the bones, arise from the entire circumference of the vertebra, comnmnicate with veins which enter through the foramina on the anterior surface442 VEINS. of fcho bodies, and converge to the principal canal, which is sometimes doublo towards its posterior part. They become greatly developed in advanced age. 4. The Veins of the Spinal Cord (medulli-spinal) consist of a minute tortuous venous plexus, which covers the entire surface of the cord, being situated between 242.—Trnnsvorso Section of a Dorsal Vertebra, showing the Spinal Veins. the pia mater and arachnoid. These vessels emerge chiefly from the posterior median furrow, and are largest in the lumbar region. Near the base of the skull they unite, and form two or three small trunks, which communicate Avith the ver- 243.—Vertical Section of two Dorsal Vertebrse, showing the Spinal Veins. tebral veins, and then terminate in the inferior cerebellar veins, or in the petrosal sinuses. Each of the spinal nerves is accompanied by a branch as far as the inter- vertebral foramina, where they join the other veins from the spinal canal. There are no valves in the spinal veins.443 01' THE LOWER EXTREMITY. VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. two »ets.

Both sets of veins are provided with valves, which are more numerous in the deep than in the super- ficial set. These valves are also more numerous in the lower than in the upper limb. The Swperfioial Veins of the lower extremity are the internal or long saphenous, and the external or short saphenous. The internal saphenous vein (fig. 244) com- mences from a minute plexus, which covers the dorsum and inner side of the foot; it ascends in front of the inner ankle, and along the inner side of the leg, behind the inner margin of the tibia, accompanied by the internal saphenous nerve. At the knee, it passes backwards behind the inner condyle of the femur, ascends along the inside of the thigh, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, terminates in the femo- ral vein about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. This vein receives in its course cuta- neous branches from the leg and thigh, and at the saphenous opening the superficial epigastric, su- perficial circumflex iliac, and external pudic veins. The veins from the inner and back part of the thigh frequently unite to form a large vessel, which enters the main trunk near the saphenous opening; and sometimes those on the outer side of the thigh join to form a large branch ; so that occasionally three large veins are seen converging from difierent parts of the thigh towards the saphenous opening. The internal saphenous vein communicates in the foot with the internal plantar vein; in the leg, with the posterior tibial veins, by branches which perforate the tibial origin of the Soleus muscle, and also with the anterior tibial veins ; at the knee, with the articular veins; in the thigh, with the femoral vein by one or more branches. The valves in this vein vary from two to six in number ; they are more numerous in the thigh than in the leg. The external or short saphenous vein (fig. 245) is formed by branches which collect the blood from the dorsum and outer side of the foot ; it ascends behind the outer ankle, and along the outer border of the tendo AchilHs, across which it passes at an acute angle to reach the middle line of the pos- terior aspect of the leg. Passing directly upwards, it perforates the deep fascia in the lower part of the popliteal space, and terminates in the popliteal vein, between the heads of the GastrocnemiusVEINS. 444 Vein. muscle. It is accompanied by the external saphenous nerve. It receives numerous largo branches from tho back part of the leg, and communicates with the deep veins on the dorsum of tho foot, and behind fahe outer malleolus. This vein has only two valves, 245.—External or Short Saphenous one of which is always found near its termination in the popliteal vein. Tho Deep Veins of tho lower extremity accom- pany the arteries and their branches, and are called the vence comites of those vessels. The external and internal plantar veins unite to form the posterior tibial. They accompany the posterior tibial artery, and are joined by the peroneal veins. The anterior tihial veins are formed by a con- tinuation upwards of the vena) comites of the dorsalis pedis artery. They perforate the in- terosseous membrane at the upper part of the leg, and form, by theii-junction with the posterior tibial, the popliteal vein.. The valves in the deep veins are very n-nmerous, The Popliteal. Vein is formed by the junction of the venae comites of the anterior and posterior tibial vessels; it ascends through the popliteal space to the tendinous aperture in the Adductor magnus,: where it becomes the femaral vein. In the lower part of its course, it is placed internal to the artery ;, between the heads of the Gastroc- nemius, it is superficial to that vessel; but abovei the knee-joint, it is close to its outer side. It receives the sural veins from the Gastrocnemius muscle, the articular veins,, and the external saphenous. The valves in this vein are usually four in number. The FemO'EAL Vein accompanies the femoral artery through the upper two-thirds of the thigh- In th-e lower part of its course, it lies external to the artery ; higher up, it is behind it; and be- neath Poupart's ligament, it lies to its inner side, and on the same plane. It receives numerous- muscular branches ; the profunda femoris joins it about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament, and' near its termination the internal sa.phenous vein.. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. The External Iliac Vein commences at the-termination of the femoral, be- neath the crural arch, and passing, upwards along the brim of the pelvis, terminates opposite the sacro-iliao symphysis, by uniting with the internal iliac to form the common iliac vein. On the right side, it lies at first along the inner side of the external iliac artery; but as it passes npwards, gradually inclines behind it. On the left side, it lies altogether on the inner side of the artery. It receives, immediately above Poupart's ligamentj the epigastric and circumflex iliac veins. It has no valves. The Internal Iliac Vein is formed by the venas comites of the branches of the internal iliac artery, the umbilical arteries excepted. It receives the blood f;rom the exterior of the pelvis by the gluteal, sciatic, internal pudic, and obturator veins ; and from the organs- in the cavity of the pelvis by the hasmorrhoidal and vesico-prostatic plexuses in the male, and the uterine and vaginal plexuses in the female. The vessels forming these plexuses are remarkable for their larger size, their frequent anastomoses,, and the number of valves which they contam. Tht445 INFERIOR CAVA. internal ilkc vein lies at first on the inner side and then beli.nd the interna ihac artery, and terminates opposite the sacro-iliac articulation, by nmting with the external iliac, to form the common iliac vein. This vessel has no valves. The hcemorrhoiclal jplexus surrounds the lower end of the rectum, being formed by the superior htemorrhoidal veins (branches of the inferior mesenteric), and the middle and inferior htemorrhoidal, which terminate m the internal ihac. ihe portal and general venous systems have a free communication by means of the branches composing this plexus. The vedco-prostatic plexus suiTOunds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland. It communicates with the hcemorrhoidal plexus behind, and receives the dorsal vein of the penis, which enters the pelvis beneath the sub- pubic ligament. This plexus is supported upon the sides of the bladder by a reflection of the pelvic fascia. The veins composing it are very' liable to become varicose, and often contain hard earthy concretions, called plileholithes. The dorsal vein of the penis is a vessel of large size, which returns the blood fi-om the body of that organ. At first it consists of two branches, which are con- tained in the groove on the dorsum of the penis, and it receives veins from the glans, the corpus spongiosum, and numerous superficial veins ; these unite near the root of the penis into a single trunk, which pierces the triangular ligament beneath the pubic arch, and divides into two branches, which enter the prostatic plexus. The vaginal plexus surrounds the mucous membrane, being especially developed at the orifice of the vagina; it communicates with the vesical plexus in front, and with the haamorrhoidal plexus behind. The utei-ine plexus is situated along the sides and superior angles of the uterus, receiving large venous canals (the uterine sinuses) from its substance. The veins composing this plexus anastomose frequently with each other and with the ovarian veins. They are not tortuous like the arteries. The Common Iliac Veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac veins in front of the sacro-vertebral articulation ; passing obliquely upwards towards the right side, they terminate upon the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra, where the veins of the two sides unite at an acute angle to form the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac is shorter than the left, nearly vertical in its direction, and ascends behind and then to the outer side of its corresponding artery. The left common iliac, longer and more oblique in its course, is at first situated on the inner side of the corresponding artery, and then behind the right common iliac. Each common iliac receives the ilio-lumbar and sometimes the lateral sacral veins. The left receives, in addition, the middle sacral vein. No valves are found in these veins. The middle sacral vein accompanies its corresponding artery along the front of the sacrum, and terminates in the left common ihac vein ; occasionally in the com- mencement of the inferior vena cava. Peculiarities. The left common iliac vein, instead of joining with the right in its usual position, occasionally ascends on the left side of the aorta as high as the kidney, where, after receiving the left renal vein, it crosses over the aorta, and then joins with the right vein to form the vena cava. In these cases, the two common iliaos are connected by a small com- municating branch at the spot where they are usually united. The Inferior Vena Cava returns to the heart the blood from all the parts below the Diaphragm. It is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins on the right side of the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrse. It passes upwards along the front of the spine, on the right side of the aorta, and having reached the under surface of the liver, is contained in a groove in its posterior border. It then perforates the tendinous centre of the Diaphragm, enters the pericardmm, where it is covered by its serous layer, and terminates in the lower and back part of the right auricle. At its termination in the auricle. It IS provided with a valve, the Eustachian, which is of large size during fo3tal life.

This vessel is sometimes placed ou the left side of the aorta, as hi"-h as tlio left renal vein, after receiving wliich, it crosses over to its usual position on the rHit side ; or it may be placed altogether on the left side of tlie aorta, as far upwards as its termination in the heart: in such cases, the abdominal aud thoracic viscera, together with the great vessels, are all transposed. Point of Termination. Occasionally, the inferior vena cava joins the right azygos vein, which is then of large size. In such cases, the superior cava receives the whole of the blood from the body before transmitting it to the right auricle, except the blood from the hepatic veins, which terminate directly in the right auricle. The lumbar veins, three or four in number on each side, collect the blood by dorsal branches from the muscles and integument of the loins, and by abdominal branches from the walls of the abdomen, where they communicate with the epigastric veins. At the spine, they receive branches from the spinal plexuses, and then pass forwards round the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae beneath the Psoas magnus, and terminate at the back part of the inferior cava. The left lumbar veins are longer than the right, and pass behind the aorta. The lumbar veins commu- nicate with each other by branches which pass in front of the transverse processes. Occasionally, two or more of these veins unite to form a single trunk, the ascending lumbar, which serves to connect the common iliac, ilio-lumbar, lumbar, and azygos veins of the corresponding side of the body. The spermatic veins emerge from the back of the testis, and receive branches from the epididymis; they form a branched and convoluted plexus, called the spermatic plexus (plexus pampiniformis), below the abdominal ring: the vessels composing this plexus are veiy numerous, and ascend along the cord in front of the vas deferens ; having entered the abdomen, they coalesce to form two branches, which ascend on the Psoas muscle, behind the peritoneum, lying one on each side of the spermatic artery, and unite to form a single vessel, which opens on the right side in the inferior vena cava, at an acute angle, on the left side in the left renal vein, at a right angle. The spermatic veins are provided with valves. The left spermatic vein passes behind the sigmoid flexure of the colon, a part of the intestine in which foecal accumulation is common; this circumstance, as well as the indirect communication of the vessel with the inferior vena cava, may serve to explain the more frequent occurrence of varicocele on the left side. The ovarian veins are analogous to the spermatic in the male ; they form a plexus near the ovary, and in the broad ligament and Fallopian tube, communi- cating with the uterine plexus. They terminate as in the male. Valves are occasionally found in these veins. These vessels, like the uterme veins, become much enlarged during pregnancy. , ■ • * The renal veins are of large size, and placed in front of the renal arteries.* The left is longer than the right, and passes in front of the aorta, just below the origin of the superior mesentei-ic artery.

The two mfeinoi-_ phTemove:ms follow the course of the phrenic arteries, and terminate, the right m the mferior vena cava, the left in the left renal vein. The hepatic veins commence in the substance of the liver, in the capillary termi- nations of the vena portro: these branches, gradually uniting, form three large vems, which converge towards the posterior border of the liver, and open into the inferior vena cava, whilst that vessel is situated in the groove at the back part of tliis organ. Of these three veins, one from the right, and another from the left lobe, open obliquely into the vena cava; that from the middle of the organ and lobuhis Spigehi having a straight course. The hepatic veins run singly, and are m direct contact with the hepatic tissue. They are destitute of valves. PoETAL System of Veins. The portal venous system is composed of four large veins, which collect the venous blood from the viscera of digestion. The trunk formed by their union (vena portse) enters the liver and ramifies throughout its substance: and its branches again emerging from that organ as the hepatic veins terminate in the inferior vena cava. The branches of this vein are in all cases single, and destitute of valves. The veins forming the portal system are, the Inferior mesenteric. Splenic. Superior mesenteric. Gastric. The inferior mesenteric vein returns the blood fi'om the rectum, sigmoid flexure, and descending colon, corresponding with the ramifications of the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. Ascending beneath the peritoneum in the lumbar region, it passes behind the transverse portion of the duodenum and pancreas, and terminates in the splenic vein. Its hsemorrhoidal branches inosculate with those of the internal iliac, and thus establish a communication between the portal and the general venous system.* The swperior mesenteric vein returns the blood from the small intestines, and from the caecum and ascending and transverse portions of the colon, corresponding with the distribution of the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The large trunk formed by the union of these branches ascends along the right side and in front of the corresponding artery, passes in front of the transverse portion of the duodenum, and unites behind the upper border of the pancrea;s with the splenic vein, to form the vena portae. It receives the right gastro-epiploic vein. The splenic vein commences by five or six large branches, which return the blood from the substance of the spleen. These uniting form a single vessel, which passes from left to right behind the upper border of the pancreas, and terminates at its greater end by uniting at a right angle with the superior mesenteric to form the vena port^. The splenic vein is of large size, and not tortuous like the artery. It receives the vasa brevia from the left extremity of the stomach, the left gastro-* epiploic vein, pancreatic branches from the pancreas, the pancreatico-duodenal vein, and the inferior mesenteric vein. The gastric is a vein of small size, which accompanies the gastric artery from left to right along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and terminates in the vena portro.

Passing upwards through the right border of the lesser omentum to the under surface of the liver, it enters the transverse fissure, where it is somewhat enlarged, forming the sinus of the portal vein, and divides into two branches, which, accompany the ramifications of the bepatic artery and hepatic duct throughout the substance of the liver. Of these two branches the right is the larger but the shorter of the two. The portal vein is about four inclies in length, and, whilst contained in tlie lesser omentum, lies bebind and between the hepatic duct and artery, the former being to the right, the latter to the left.

The veins which retni-n the blood from the substance of the heart are, the Great cardiac vein. Anterior cardiac veins. Posterior cardiac vein. VensD Thebesu. The Ch-eat Cardiaa Vain is a vessel of considerable size, which commences at the apex of the heai-t, and ascends along the anterior interventricular groove to the base of the ventricles. It then curves to the left side, around the auriculo- ventricular groove, between the left auricle and ventricle, to the back part of the heart, and opens into the coronary sinus, its aperture being guarded by two valves. It receives the posterior cardiac vein, and the left cardiac veins from the left auricle and ventricle, one of which, ascending along the left margm of the ventricle, is of large size. The branches joining it are provided with valves. The Posterior Cardiac Vein commences, by small branches, at the apex of the heart, communicating with those of the preceding. It ascends along the posterior interventricular groove to the base of the heart, and terminates in the coronary sinus, its orifice being guarded by a valve. It receives the veins from the posterior sm-face of both ventricles. The Anterior Cardiac Veins are three or four small branches, which collect the blood from the anterior surface of the right ventricle. One of these (the vein of Galen), larger than the rest, runs along the right border of the heart. They open separately into the lower part of the right auricle. The Vence TJiehesii are numerous minnte veins, which return the blood directly from the muscular substance, without entering the venons current. They open, by minute orifices (foramima Thebesu), on the inner surface of the right auricle. The Coronary Sinus is that portion of the great cardiac vein which is situated in the posterior part of the left auriculo-ventricular groove. It is about an inch in length, presents a considerable dilatation, and is covered by the muscular fibres of the left auricle. It receives the great cardiac vein, the posterior cardiac vein, and an oblique vein from the back part of the left auricle, the renmant of the obliterated left innominate trunk of the fcBtus, described by Mr. Marshall. The coronary sinus terminates in the right auricle, between the inferior vena cava and the auriculo-ventricular aperture, its orifice being guarded by a semilunar fold of the lining membrane of the heart, the coronary valve. All the branches joining this vessel, excepting the oblique vein above-mentioned, are provided with valves. The Pulmonary Veins. The Pulmonary Veins return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart. They are four in number, two for each lung. The pidmonary difier from other veins in several respects:—i. They carry arterial instead of venous blood. 2. They are destitute of valves. 3. They are only slightly larger than the arteries they accompany. 4. They accompany those vessels singly. They commence in a capillary network, upon the parietes of the bronchial cells, where they are continuous with the ramifications of the pulmonary artery, and, uniting together, form a single trunk for each lobule. These branches, uniting succes- sively, form a single trunk for each lobe, three for the right, and two for the left lung. The vein from the middle lobe of the right lung unites with that from the upper lobe, in most cases, forming two trunks on each side, which open separately into the left auricle. Occasionally, they remain separate ; there are then three veins on the right side. Not unfrequcntly, the two left pulmonary veins terminate by a common opening. G GVEINS. 45° WiiUn the lung, the brandies of tlio pulmonary artery are in front, the veins heldnd, and tlio bronchi between the two. At the root of the lung, the veins are in front, the artery in the middle, and the bronchus behind. Within the poncardiim; their anterior surface is invested by the serous layer of this membrane. The right pulmonary veins pass behind the right auricle and ascending aorta; the left pass in front of tlie thoracic aorta, with the left pulmonary artery.Of the Lymphatics. THE LymphaticR hare derived their name from the appearance of the fluid con- tained in their interior {hjmplia, water). They arc also called absorbents, from the property they possess of absorbing certain materials from the tissues, and conveying them into the circnlation. The lymphatic system includes not only the lymphatic vessels and the glands through which they pass, but also the lacteal, or chyliferous vessels. The lacteals are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestine, and differ in no respect from the lymphatics generally, excepting that they contain a milk-white fluid, the chyle, during the process of digestion, and convey it into the blood through the thoracic duct. The lymphatics are exceedingly delicate vessels, the coats of which are so transparent, that the fluid they contain is readily seen through them. They retain a nearly nniform size, being interrupted at intervals by constrictions, which give them a knotted or beaded appearance. These constrictions are due to the presence of valves in their interior. Lymphatics have been found in nearly every texture and organ of the body, with the exception of the substance of the brain and spinal cord, the eyeball, cartilage, tendon, the membranes of the ovum, the. placenta, and umbilical cord, the nails, cuticle, and hair. Their existence in the substance of bone is doubtful. The Ivmphatics are arranged into a superficial and deep set. The superficial lymphatics, on the surface of the body, are placed immediately beneath the integu- ment, accompanying the superficial veins ; they join the deep lymphatics in certain situations by perforating the deep fascia. In the interior of the body, they lie in the submucous areolar tissue, throughout the whole length of the gastro-pulmonary and genito-urinary tracts; and in the subserous areolar tissue in the cranial,, thoracic, and abdominal cavities. These vessels probably arise in the form of a dense plexiform network interspersed among the proper elements and blood-vessels of the several tissues ; the vessels composing which, as well as the meshes between them, are much, larger than those of the capillary plexus. From these networks small vessels emerge, which pass, either to a neighbouring gland, or to join some larger lymphatic trunk. The deep lymphatics, fewer in number, and larger than the superficial, accompany the deep blood-vessels. Their mode of origin is not known ; it is, however, probably, similar to that of the superficial vessels. The lymphatics of any part or organ exceed the veins in number ; but in size they are much smaller. Their anastomoses also, especially those of the large trunks, are more freqiient, and are effected by vessels equal in diameter to those which they connect, the continuous trunks retaining the same diameter. The lymphatic or absorbent glands, named also conglobate glands, are small solid glandular bodies, situated in the course of the lymphatic and lacteal vessels. They are found in the neck and on the external parts of the head ; in the upper extremity, in the axilla and in front of the elbow ; in the lower extremity, in the groin and popliteal space. In the abdomen, they are found in large numbers in the mesentery, and along the side of the aorta, vena cava, and iliac vessels ; and in the thorax, in the anterior and posterior mediastina. They are somewhat flattened, and of a round or oval form. In size, they vary from a hemp-seed to an almond, and their colour, on section, is of a pinkish grey tint, excepting the bronchial glands, which in the adult are mottled with black. Each gland has a layer, or capsule of cellular tissue investing it, from which prolongations dip into its substance forming partitions. The lymphatic and lacteal vessels pass through these bodies in their passage to the thoracic and lymphatic ducts. A lymphatic or lacteal vessel, previous to entering a gland, divides into several small branches which are named afferent vessels. As they enter, their external coat becomes con- tinuous with the capsule of the gland, and the vessels, much thinnod, and consisting o o 2452 LYMFHA^TiCiS. Jttnif only of their internal coat and epithelium, pass into the gland, where they subdivide and pursue a tortuous course ; and thoy finally anastomose, so as to form a plexus. The vessels composing this plexus unite to form two or more e/ere?ii vessels, which, on emerging from the gland, are again invested with their external coat. Further details on the minute anatomy of the lymphatic vessels and glands will be found in' the Introduction. Thoracic Duct. The thoracic duct (fig. 247) conveys the great mass of the lymph and chyle into the blood. It is the common trunk of all the lymphatic vessels of the body, excepting those of the right side of the head, neck, and 247.-The Thoracic and Right Lymphatic Duct, thorax, and right upper ex- tremity, the right lung, right side of the heart, and the convex surface of the liver. It varies from eighteen to twenty inches in length in the adult, and extends from the second lumbar vertebra to the root of the neck. It commences in the abdomen by a triangular dilatation, the receptaculum chyli (reservoir or cistern, of Pecquet), which is situated upon the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra., to the right side and behind the aorta, by the side of the right crus of the Diaphragm. It ascends into the thorax through the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and is placed in the posterior mediastinum in front of the vertebral column, lying be- tween the aorta and vena azygos. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra, it inclines to- wards the left side and ascends behind the arch of the aorta, on the left side of the osso- phagus, and behind the first portion of the left subclavian artery to the upper orifice of the thorax. Opposite the upper border of the seventh cervical vertebra, it curves downwards above the sub- clavian artery, and in fi-ont of the Scalenus muscle, so as to form an arch; and ter- minates near the angle of junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. The thoracic duct, at its com- mencement, is about equal in size to the diameter of a goose- Tntevcostal GlanilsOP THE HEAD AND FACE. 453 .null, diminishes considerably in its calibre in the middle of the thora., and ,1 ao'aiu dilated just belbre its termination. It is generally flexuous in its course, ud constricted at intervals so as to present a varicose appearance 1 he thoracic auctnot nnfreqnently divides in the middle of its course uito two branches of unequal size, which soon re-unite, or into several branches which form a plexi- form interlacement. It occasionally bifurcates, at its upper part, into two branches,' of which the one on the left side terminates in the usual manner while that on the right opens into the right subclavian vein, in connection with the rio-ht lymphatic duct. The thoracic duct has numerous valves throughout its whole course, but they are more numerous in the upper than in the lower part; at its terramation it is provided with a pair of valves, the free borders of which are turned towards the vein, so as to prevent the regurgitation of venous blood into the duct. Branches. The thoracic duct, at its commencement, receives four or hve large trunks from the abdominal lymphatic glands, and also the trunk of the lacteal vessels. Within the thorax, it is joined by the lymphatic vessels from the left half of the wall of the thoracic cavity, the lymphatics from the sternal and intercostal glands, those of the left lung, left side of the heart, trachea, and oesophagus ; and just before its termination, receives the lymphatics of the left side of the head and neck, and left upper extremity. Structure. The thoracic duct is composed of three coats, which differ in some respects from those of the lymphatic vessels. The internal coat consists of a layer of epithehum, resting upon some striped lamellee, and an elastic fibrous coat, the fibres of which run in a longitudinal direction. The middle coat consists of a layer of connective tissue, beneath which are several laminte of muscular tissue, the fibres of which are disposed transversely, and intermixed with the elastic fibres. The external coat is composed of areolar tissue, with elastic fibres and isolated fasci- culi of muscular fibres. The Bight Lymphatic Duct is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and a line or a Ime and a half in diameter, which receives the lymph from the right side of the head and neck, the right upper extremity, the right side of the thorax, the right lung and right side of the heart, and from the convex surface of the liver, and terminates at the angle of union of the right subclavian and right internal jugular veins. Its orifice is guarded by two semilunar valves, which prevent the entrance of blood from the veins. Lymphatics of the Head, Face, and Keck. The Superficial Lijvipliatic Glands of the Head (fig. 248) are of small size, few in number, and confined to its posterior region. They are the occipital, placed at the back of the head along the attachment of the Occipito-frontalis ; and the posterior auricular, near the upper end of the Sterno-mastoid. These glands are affected in cutaneous eruptions and other diseases of the scalp. In the face, the superficial lymphatic glands are more numerous: they are the parotid, some of which are superficial and others deeply placed in the substance of the parotid gland ; the zygomatic, situated under the zygoma; the buccal, on the surface of the Buccinator ' muscle ; and the submaxillary, the largest, beneath the body of the lower jaw. The superficial lymphatics of the head are divided into an anterior and a posterior set, which follow the course of the temporal and occipital vessels. The • temporal set accompany the temporal artery in front of the ear, to the parotid lymphatic glands, from which they proceed to the lymphatic glands of the neck. > The occipital set follow the course of the occipital artery, descend to the occipital and posterior auricular lymphatic glands, and from thence join the cervical glands. The superficial lymphatics of the face are more numerous than those of the head, and commence over its entire surface. Those from the frontal region ac- company the frontal vessels ; they then pass obliquely across the face, running withLYMPtlATICS. 454 the facial vein, pass through the buccal glands on the surface of the Buccinator muscle, and join the submaxillary lymphatic glands. The latter receive the lymphatic vessels from the lips, and are often found enlarged in cases of malignant disease of those parts. Tim deep lymjjhalicH of the face are derived from the pituitary membrane of the nose, the mucous mcrabrauo of the mouth and pharynx, and the contents of the temporal and orbital ibssro ; they accompany the branches of the internal maxillary artery, and" terminate in the deep parotid, and cervical lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatics of the cranium consist of two sets, the meningeal and cerebiul. The meningeal lymphatics accompany the meningeal vessels, escape 248.—The Superficial Lymphatics and Glands of the Head, Face, and Neck. through foramina at the base of the skull, and join the deep cervical lymphatic .rlands The cerebral lymphatics are described by Eshmann as being situated between the arachnoid and pia mater, as well as in the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles; they accompany the trunks of the carotid and vertebral arteries, and probably pass through foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. They have not at present been demonstrated m the dura mater, or in the substance of the brain. , The Lymphatic Glands of the Neclc are divided into two sets, superfacial ana *^^^The suverficial cervical glands are placed in the course of the external jugnlar ■vein between the Platysma and Sterno-mastoid.

The superficial and deep cervical lymphatics are a continuation of those already described on the cranium and face. After traversing the glands in those regions, they pass through the chain of glands which lie along the sheath of the carotid vessels, being joined by the lymphatics from the pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland. At the lower part of the neck, after receiving some lymphatics from the thorax, they unite into a single trunk, which terminates on the left side, in the thoracic duct; on the right side, in the right lymphatic duct. Lymphatics of the Upper Extremity. The Lymphatic Glands of the upper extremity (6g. 250) may be subdivided into two sets, superficial and deep.LYMPHATICS. 456 The superficial lymphatic glands are few, and of small size. There are occasion- ally two or three in front of the elbow, and one or two above the internal condyle of the humerus, near the haailic vein. The decjp lymphatic glands are also few in number. In tlie fore-arm a few small ones are occasionally found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels; and in tlie arm, there is a chain of small glands along the inner side of the brachial artery. 250.—The Superficial Lymphatics and Glands of the Upper Extremity. The axillary glands are of large size, and usually ten or twelve in number. A chain of these glands surrotmds the axillary vessels imbedded in a quantity of loose areolar tissue ; they receive the lymphatic vessels from the arm; others are dispersed in the areolar tissue of the axilla: the remainder are arranged m two series, a small chain running along the lower border of the Pectoralis major, as far as the mammary gland, receiving the lymphatics from the front of the chest and mamma; and others are placed along the lower margin of the posterior wall of the axilla, which receive the lymphatics from the integument of the back. TwoOF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 457 or three subclavian lymphatic .glands are placed immediately beneath the clavicle ; U is through these that the axillary a.id deep cervical glands communicate with each other. One is figured by Mascagni near the umbilicus. In malignant diseases, tumours, or other affections implicatiug the upper part of the back and shoulder, the front of the chest and mamma, the upper part of the front and side of the abdomen, or the hand, fore-arm, and arm, the axillary glands are liable to be found enlarged. „ . The mperficial lymphatics of the upper extremity arise from the skin ot the liand, and run along the sides of the fingers chiefly on the dorsal surface of the hand; they then pass up the fore-arm, and subdivide into two sets, which take the course of the subcutaneous veins. Those from the inner border of the hand accompany the ulnar veins along the inner side of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, where they join with some lymphatics from the outer side of the fore-arm ; they then follow the course of the basilic vein, communicate with the glands immediately above the elbow, and terminate in the axillary glands, joining with the deep lymphatics. The superficial lymphatics from the outer and back part of the hand accompany the radial veins to the bend of the elbow. They are less numerous than the preceding. At the bend of the elbow, the greater number join the basilic group ; the rest ascend with the cephalic vein on the outer side of the arm, some crossing the upper part of the Biceps obliquely, to terminate in the axillary glands, whilst one or two accompany the cephalic vein in the cellular interval between the Pectorahs major and Deltoid, and enter the subclavian lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatics of the upper extremity accompany the deep blood-vessels. In the fore-arm, they consist of three sets, corresponding with the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries ; they pass through the glands occasionally found in the coui'se of those vessels, and communicate at intervals with the superficial lymphatics. In their course upwards, some of them pass through the glands which lie upon the brachial artery; they then enter the axillary and subclavian glands, and at the root of the neck terminate, on the left side, in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the right lymphatic duct. Lymphatics of the Lower Extremity. The Lymphatic Glands of the lower extremity may be subdivided into two sets, superficial and deep ; the former are confined to the inguinal region. The superficial inguinal glands, placed immediately beneath the integument, are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are divisible into two groups: an upper, disposed irregularly along Poupart's ligament, which receive the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the scrotum, penis, parietea of the abdomen, perineal and gluteal regions; and an inferior group, which surround the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, a few being sometimes con- tinned along the saphenous vein to a variable extent. The latter receive the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. These glands frequently become enlarged in diseases implicating the parts from which their lymphatics originate. Thus in malignant or syphilitic affections of the prepuce and penis, or of the labia majora in the female, in cancer scroti, in abscess in the perinaeum, or in any other disease affecting the integument and superficial structures in those parts, or the sub-umbilical part of the abdomen or gluteal region, the upper chain of glands is a.lmost invariably enlarged, the lower chain being implicated in diseases affecting the lower limb. The deep lymphatic glands are, the anterior tibial, popliteal, deep inguinal, gluteal, and ischiatic. The anterior tibial gland is not constant in its existence. It is generally found by the side of the anterior tibial artery, upon the interosseous membrane at the upper part of the leg. Occasionally, two glands are found in this situation. The deep popliteal glands, four or five in number, are of small size; they surroundLYMPHATICS. 458 the popliteal vessels, imbedded in the cellular tissue and fat ol' the popliteal space. The deep ingioinal (jltvmls arc placed beneath the deep fascia around the femoral artery and vein. They are of small size, and communicate with the superficial inguinal glands through the saphenous opening. The (jluteal and ischicUic glands are placed, the former above, the latter below the Pyriformis muscle, resting on their corresponding vessels as they pass through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The Lymphatics of the lower extremity, like the veins, may be divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial lymphatics are placed between the integument and superficial fascia, and are divisible into two groups ; an internal group, which follow the course of the internal saphenous vein; and an external group, which accom- pany the external saphenous. The internal group, the larger, commences on the inner side and dorsum of the foot; they pass, some in front, and some behind the inner angle, run up the leg with the internal saphenous vein, pass with it behind the inner condyle of the femur, and accompany it to the groin, where they terminate in the group of in- guinal glands which surround the saphen- ous opening. Some of the efferent vessels from these glands pierce the cribriform fascia and sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminate in a lymphatic gland contained in the femoral canal, thus establishing a communication between the lymphatics of the lower extremity and those of the trunk ; others pierce the fascia lata, and join the deep inguinal o-lands. The external group arise from the outer side of the foot, ascend in front of the leg, and, just below the knee, cross the tibia from without in- wards, to join the lymphatics on the inner side of the thigh. Others com- mence on the outer side of the foot, pass behind tlie outer malleolus, and accompany the external saphenous vein along the back of the leg, where they enter the popliteal glands. The deep lymphatics of the lower ex- tremity are few in number, and accompany the deep blood-vessels. In the leg, they consist of three sets, the anterior tibial, 251.1—The Superficial Lymphatica and Glands of the Lower Extremity.OF THE PELVIS AND ABDOMEN. 459 peroneal, and posterior tibial, which accompany the correspondmg blood-vessels, two or tht-ee to each artery; they ascend with the blood-vessels, and enter the lymphatic glands in the popliteal space; the efferent vessels from these glands accompany the femoral vein, and join the deep ingniual glands ; from these, the vessels pass beneath Poupart's ligament, and communicate with the chain of glands surrounding the external iliac vessels. ■ The deep lymphatics of the gluteal and ischiatic regions follow the course oi the blood-vessels, and join the gluteal and ischiatic glands at the great sacro-sciatic foramen. Lymphatics of the Pelvis and Abdomen. The deef lym;phatic glands in the pelvis are, the external iliac, the internal iliac, and the saci-al. Those of the abdomen are the lumbar glands. The external iliac glands form an uninterrupted chain round the external iliac vessels, three being placed round the commencement of the vessels just behind the crural arch. They communicate below with the femoral lymphatics, and above with the lumbar glands. The internal iliac glands surround the internal iliac vessels ; they receive the lymphatics corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac artery, and commu- nicate with the lumbar glands. The sacral glands occupy the sides of the anterior surface of the sacrum, some being situated in the meso-rectal fold. These and the internal iliac glands are affected in malignant disease of the bladder, rectum, or uterus. The lumbar glands are very numerous ; they are situated on the front of the lumbar vertebrae, surroundiDg the common iliac vessels, the aorta, and vena cava ; they receive the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremities and pelvis, as well as from the testes and some of the abdominal viscera; the efferent vessels from these glands unite into a few large trunks, wbich, with the lacteals, form the com- mencement of the thoracic duct. In some cases of malignant disease, these glands become enormously enlarged, completely surrounding the aorta and vena cava, and occasionally greatly contracting the calibre of those vessels. In all cases of malignant disease of the testis, and in malignant disease of the lower limb, before any operation is attempted, careful examination of the abdomen should be made, in order to ascertain if any enlargement exists ; and if any should be detected, all operative measures should be avoided, as fruitless. The lymphatics of the pelvis and abdomen may be divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The sivperficial lymphatics of the walls of the abdomen and pelvis follow tbe course of the superficial blood-vessels. Those derived from the integument of the lower part of the abdomen below the umbilicus, follow the course of the superficial epi- gastric vessels, and converge to the superior group of the superficial inguinal glands; the deep set accompany the deep epigastric vessels, and communicate with the external iliac glands. The superficial lymphatics from the sides of the lumbar part of the abdominal wall wind round the crest of the ilium, accompanying the superficial circumflex iliac vessels, to join the superior group of the superficial inguinal glands; the greater number, however, run backwards along with tho iho-lumbar and lumbar vessels, to join the lumbar glands. The superficial lymphatics of the gluteal region turn horizontally round the outer side of the nates, and join the superficial inguinal glands. The superficial lymphatics of the scrotum am,d perinoium follow the course of the external pudic vessels, and terminate in the superficial inguinal glands. The superficial lymphatics of the penis occupy the sides and dorsum of the organ, the latter receiving the lymphatics from the skin covering the glans penis; they all converge to the upper chain of the superficial inguinal glands. The deep lymphatic vessels of the penis follow the course of the internal pudic vessels, and join the internal iliac glands.46o LYMPHATICS. In the femalt', tlie lyrapliafiic vessels of tlio mucous membrane of tlie labia, nympUo), and clitoris, terminate in tbe upper chain of the inguinal glands. The cZee^) hjvi}iludics of tlui jiolvig and ahdomon take the course of the principal blood-vessels. Those of the parietes of the pelvis, which accompany the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the course of the internal iliac artery, and ultimately join the lumbar lymphatics. 252. The Deep Lymphatic Vessels and Glands of the Abdomen and Pelvis. The efferent vessels from the inguinal glands enter the pelvis beneath Poupart's ligament, where they he in close relation with the femoral vein ; they then pass through 'the chain of glands surrounding the external iliac vessels, and finally terminate in the lumbar glands. They receive the deep epigastric, circumflex ilia<^, and ilio-lumbar lymphatics. The lynvphatics of the bladder arise from the entire surface of the organ; tue461 OF THE LLVEll AND STOMACH. , 1 r>n..;fr.Tioiim on its posterior surface, and, after ffi-eatcr number run beneath the peiitoneuni uu 1 fi,„ K^mr.l,nf;r.a ^.ssing through the lymphatic glands in that ^^taahon, joni w.U the ^^^^^^^ from the prosrate and vesiculiB seminales, and enter the '-'''^^l^^'^lf^^^^^ The lymphatics of the rectum are of large size; after passing ^l^^o-f Te sacm glands that lie upoaa its enter wall and in the meso-rectum, they pass to the sacral o or lumbar glands. The lymphatics of the uterus consist of two sets, superficia and deep: the former being placed beneath the peritoneum, the latter in the stxbstance of the organ. The lymphatics of the cervix uteri, together with those from the vagma, enter the internal ihac and sacral glands ; those from the body and fundus of the uterus pass outwards in the broad ligaments, and, being joined by the lymphatics trom tlie ovaries, broad ligaments, and Fallopian tubes, ascend with the ovarian vessels to open into the lumbar glands. In the unimpregnated uterus, they are small; but dm-ing gestation, they become very greatly enlarged. The lymphatics of the testicle consist of two sets, superficial and deep; the former commence on the surface of the tunica vaginalis, the latter in the epididymis and body of the testis. They form several large trunks, which ascend with the spermatic cord, and accompanying the spermatic vessels into the abdomen, open into the lumbar glands ; hence the enlargement of these glands in malignant disease of the testis. The lymphatics of the kidney arise on the surface, and also in the interior of the organ ; they join at the hilum, and, after receiving the lymphatic vessels from the m-eter and suprarenal capsules, open into the lumbar glands. The lymphatics of the liver are divisible into two sets, superficial and deep. The former arise in the sub-peritoneal areolar tissue over the entire surface of the organ. Those on the convex sm-face may be divided into fonr groups :— i. Those which pass from behind forwards, consisting of three or four branches, which ascend in the longitudinal ligament, and unite to form a single trunk, which passes up between the fibres of the Diaphragm, behind the ensiform cartilage, to enter the anterior mediastinal glands, and finally ascends to the root of the neck, to terminate in the right lymphatic duct. 2. Another group, which also incline from behind forwards, are reflected over the anterior margin of the liver to its under surface, and from thence pass along the longitudinal fissure to the glands in the gastro-hepatic omentum. 3. -A third group incline outwards to the right lateral ligament, and uniting into one or two large trunks, pierce the Diaphragm, and run along its upper surface to enter the anterior mediastinal glands; or, instead of entering the thorax, turn inwards across the cms of the Diaphragm, and open into the commencement of the thoracic duct. 4. The fourth group incline outwards from the surface of the left lobe of the liver to the left lateral ligament, pierce the Diaphragm, and passing forwards, terminate in the glands in the anterior mediastinum. The superficial lymphatics on the under surface of the liver are divided into three sets :—I. Those on the right side of the gall-bladder enter the lumbar glands. 2. Those surrounding the gall-bladder form a remarkable plexus : they accompany the hepatic vessels, and open into the glands in the gastro-hepatic omentum. 3. Those on the left of the gall-bladder pass to the oesophageal glands, and to the glands which are situated along the lesser curvature of the stomach. The deep lymphatics accompany the branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery and duct through the substance of the liver ; passing out at the transverse fissure, they enter the lymphatic glands along the lesser curvature of the stomach and behind the pancreas, or join with one of the lacteal vessels previous to its termination in the thoracic duct. The lymphatic glands of the stomach are of small size: they are placed along the lesser and gi'eater curvatures, some witliin the gastro-splenic omentum, wjiilst others surround the cardiac and pyloric orifices. The lymphatics of the stomach consist of two sets, superficial and deep; the former originating in the subserous, and the latt«r in the submucous coat. They462 LYMPHATICS. follow the course of the blood-vessels, and may, consequently, be arranged into three groups. The fird (jroiqi accompany tho coronary vessels along the lesser curvature, receiving branches from both surftices of the organ, and pass to the glands around the pylorus. The second group pass from the great end of the stomach, accompany the vasa brevia, and enter the splenic lymphatic glands. The third group run along the greater curvature witli the riglit gastro-epiploic vessels, and terminate at the root of tho mesentery in one of the principal lacteal vessels. Tlio h/mphatic glands of the spleen occupy tho liilum. Its lymphatic vessels consist of two sets, superficial and deep ; the former are placed beneath its peritoneal covering, tho latter in tho substance of the organ : they accompany the blood-vessels, passing through a series of small glands, and after receiving the lymphatics from the pancreas, ultimately pass into tlie thoracic duct. The Lymphatic System of the Intestines. ' The lymphatic glands of the small intestine are placed between the layers of the mesentery, occupying the meshes formed by the superior mesenteric vessels, and hence called mesenteric glands. They vary in number from a hundred to a hundred and fifty : and in size, from that of a pea to that of a small almond. These glands are most numerous, and largest, above near the duodenum, and below opposite the termination of the ileum in the colon. This latter group becomes enlarged and infiltrated with deposit in cases of fever accompanied with ulceration of the intestines. The lymphatic glands of the large intestine are much less numerous than the mesenteric glands: they are situated along the vascular arches formed by the arteries previous to their distribution, and even sometimes upon the intestine itself. They are fewest in number along the transverse colon, where they form an uninterrupted chain with the mesenteric glands. The lymphatics of the small intestine are called lacieals, from the milk-white fluid they usually contain; they consist of two sets, superficial and deep : the former lie beneath the peritoneal coat, taking a longitudinal course along the outer side of the intestine ; the latter occupy the submucous tissue, and coursse transversely round the intestine, accompanied by the branches of the mesenteric vessels: they pass between the layers of the mesentei-y, enter the mesenteric glands, and finally unite to form two or three large trunks, which terminate in the thoracic duct. The lymphatics of the large intestine consist of two sets : those of the cascum, ascending and transverse colon, which, after passing through their proper glands, enter the mesenteric glands ; and those of the descending colon and rectum, which pass to the lumbar glands. The Lymphatics of the Thorax. The deep hjmphatic glands of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammary, anterior, mediastinal, and posterior mediastinal. The intercostal glands are small, irregular in number, and situated on each side of the spine, near the costo-vertebral articulations, some being placed between the two planes of intercostal muscles. The internal m.ammary glands are placed at the anterior extremity of each intercostal space, by the side of the internal mammary vessels. • The anterior mediastinal glands are placed in the loose areolar tissue of the anterior mediastinum, some lying upon the Diapliragm in front of the pericardium, and others round the great vessels at the base of the heart. The posterior mediastinal glands are situated in the areolar tissue m the posterior mediastinum, forming a continuous chain by tho side of the aorta and cesophagus ; they communicate on each side with the intercostal, below with the lumbar glands, and above with the deep cervical.OF THE THORAX. 463 The superficial lymphatics of the front of the thorns run across the ^^^^'J^-'^^^^ muscle, and those on the back part of this cavity he .pon ho Trapez u and Lat.s- slmns dorsi; they all converge to the axillary glands. The ly^pha ics f. om the mamma run along the lo>Yer border of the Pectorahs major through a cham of small lymphatic glands, and communicate with the axdlary glands. 'Yhl deep hjrnphaiics of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammary, and diaphraermatic. , , , . . „ Ihe intercostal lymphatics follow the course of the intercostal vessels, recewmg lymphatics from the intercostal muscles and pleura; they pass backwards to the spine, and unite with lymphatics from the back part of the thorax and spmal canal. After traversing the intercostal glands, they incHno down the spme, and termmate in the thoracic duct. The intmial mammary lymphatics follow the course of the internal mammary vessels; they commence in the muscles of the abdomen above the umbilicus, communicating with the epigastric lymphatics, ascend between the fibres of the Diaphragm at its attachment to the ensiform appendix, and in their course behind the costal cartilages are joined by the intercostal lymphatics, terminating on the right side in the right lymphatic duct, on the left side in the thoracic duct. The lymphatics of the Diaphragm follow the course of their corresponding vessels, and terminate, some in front, in the anterior mediastinal and internal mammary glands, some behind in the intercostal and hepatic lymphatics. The hronchial glands are situated round the bifurcation of the trachea and roots of the lungs. They are ten or twelve in number, the largest being placed opposite the bifurcation of the trachea, the smallest round the bronchi and their primary divisions for some little distance within the substance of the lungs. In infancy, they present the same appearance as lymphatic glands in other situations, in the adult they assume a brownish tinge, and in old age a deep black colour. Occasionally, they become sufficiently enlarged to compress and narrow the canal of the bronchi ; and they are often the seat of tubercle or deposits of phosphate of lime. The lymphatics of the lung consist of two sets, superficial and deep: the former are placed beneath the pleura, forming a minute plexus, which covers the outer surface of the lung ; the latter accompany the blood-vessels, and run along the bronchi : they both terminate at the root of the lungs in the bronchial glands. The efferent vessels from these glands, two or three in number, ascend npon the trachea to the root of the neck, traverse the tracheal and oesophageal glands, and terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the right lymphatic duct. The cardiac lymphatics consist of two sets,- superficial and deep ; the former arise in the subserous areolar tissue of the surface, and the latter beneath the internal lining membrane of the heart. They follow the course of the coronary vessels; those of the right side unite into a trunk at the root of the aorta, which, ascending across the arch of that vessel, passes backwards to the trachea, upon which it ascends, to terminate at the root of the neck in the right lymphatic duct. Those of the left side unite into a single vessel at the base of the heart, which, passing along the pulmonary artery, and traversing some glands at the root of the aorta, ascends on the trachea to terminate in the thoracic duct. The thymic lymphatics arise from the spinal surface of the thymus gland, and terminate on each side in the internal jugular veins. The thyroid lymphatics arise from either lateral lobe of this organ; they converge to form a short trunk, which terminates on the right side in the right lymphatic duct, on the left side in the thoracic duct. The lymphatics of the oesophagus form a plexus round that tube, traverse the glands in the posterior mediastinum, and, after communicating with the pulmonary lymphatic vessels near the roots of the lungs, terminate in the thoracic duct.I Nervous System. TiHE Nervous System is composed: i. of a scries of connected central organs, called, collectively, tlie cerehro-spinal centre or axis; 2. the ganglia; and, 3. of the nerves. The Cerebro-Spinal Centre consists of two parts, the spinal cord and the ence- phalon: the latter may be subdivided into the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the medulla oblongata. The Spinal Cobd and its Membranes. Dissection. To dissect the cord and its membranes, it will he necessary to lay open the whole length of the spinal canal. For this purpose, the muscles must be separated from the vertebral grooves, so as to expose the sphious processes and laminjE of the vertebrae; and the latter must be sawn through on each side, close to the roots of the transverse processes, from the third or fourth cervical vertebra, above, to the sacrum below. The vertebral arches having been displaced, by means of a chisel, and the separate fragments removed, the dura mater will be exposed, covered by a plexus of veins and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, often infiltrated with serous fluid. The arches of the upper vertebraj are best divided by means of a strong pair of cutting bone-forceps. I Membbanes of the Cord. The membranes which envelope the spinal cord are three in number. The most external is the dura mater, a strong fibrous membrane, which forms a loose sheath around the cord. The most internal is the pia mater, a cellulo-vascular membrane, which closely invests the entire surface of the cord. Between the two is the arachnoid membrane, an intermediate serous sac, which envelopes the cord, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the dura mater. The Dura Mater of the cord, continuous with that which invests the brain, is a loose sheath which surrounds the cord, and is separated from the bony walls of the spinal canal by a quantity of loose areolar adipose tissue, and a plexus of veins. Tt is attached to the circumference of the foramen magnum, and to the posterior common ligament, throughout the whole length of the spinal canal; by fibrous tissue, and extends, below, as far as the top of the sacrum; but, beyond this point, it is impervious, being continued, in the form of a slender cord, to the back of the coccyx, where it blends with the periosteum. This sheath is much larger than is necessary for its contents, and its size is greater in the cervical and lumbar regions than in the dorsal. Its inner surface is smooth, covered by a layer of polygonal cells ; and on each side may be seen the double openings which trans- mit the two roots of the corresponding spinal nerve, the fibrous layer of the dura mater being continued in the form of a tubular prolongation on them as they issue from these apertures. These prolongations of the dura mater are short in the upper part of the spine, but become gradually longer below, forming a number ot tubes of fibrous membrane, which enclose the sacral nerves, and are contained m the spinal canal. , , The chief peculiarities of the dura mater of the cord, as compared Avitli tnac investing the brain, are the following :SPINAL CORD. 465 2 q^-The Spinal Cord nnd its The dara mater of the cord is not adherent to the Membrtuies bones of the spinal canal, which have an independent lTdo"e?not send partitions into tlie fissures of the cord, as in the brain. Its fibrous lamintB do not separate, to form venous sinuses, as in the brain. _ n ^ Structure. The dura mater consists of v^liite fibrous tissue, arranged in bands which intersect one another. It is sparingly supplied with vessels; and no nerves have as yet been traced into it. The Arachnoid is exposed by slitting up the dura mater, and reflecting that membrane to either side (fig. 253). It is a thin, delicate, serous membrane, which invests the outer surface of the cord, and is then reflected upon the inner surface of the dura mater, to which it is intimately adherent. Above, it is continuous with the cerebral arachnoid ; below, it is reflected on the various nerves, so that its parie- tal and visceral layers become continuous with each other. The visceral layer is the portion which sur- rounds the cord, and that which lines the inner surface of the dura mater is called the parietal layer;* the interval between the two is called the cavity of the arachnoid. The visceral layer forms a loose sheath around the cord, so as to leave a considerable interval between the two, which is called the sub-arachnoidean space. This space is largest at the lower part of the spinal canal, and encloses the mass of nerves which form the Cauda equina. It contains an abundant serous secretion, the cerebro-spinal fluid, and usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the brain, by means of an opening in the fibrous layer of the inferior boundary of the fourth ventricle. This secretion is suflicient in amount to expand the arachnoid mem- brane, so as to completely fill up the whole of the space included in the dura mater. The sub-arachnoidean space is crossed, at the back part of the cord, by numerous fibrous bands, which stretch from the arachnbid to the pia mater, especially in the cervical region, and is partially sub- divided by a longitudinal membranous partition, which serves to connect the arachnoid with the pia mater, opposite the posterior median fissure. This partition is incomplete, and cribriform in struc- ture, consisting of bundles of white fibrous tissue, interlacing with each other. The visceral layer of the arachnoid surrounds the spinal nerves where they arise from the cord, and encloses them in a tubular sheath as far as their point of exit from the dura mater, where it becomes continuous with the parietal layer. The arachnoid is destitute of vessels. No nerves have as yet been traced into this membrane. The Fia Mater of the cord is exposed on the removal of the arachnoid (fig. 253). It is less vascular ru structure than the pia mater of the brain, with which it is continuous, being thicker, more dense in structure, and composed of fibrous tissue, arranged in longitudinal bundles. It covers the entire surface of the cord to * KoUiker denies that the inner surface of the dura mater is covered by an outer layer of the arachnoid, and states that nothing is found here except an epithelial layer, no trace of a special membrane existing.

It also forms a sheath for each of the lilaments of the spinal nerves, and invests the nerves themselves. A longitudinal fibrous band extends along the middle lino on its anterior surface, called by Haller the linea splendens; and a somewhat similar band, the ligameutum denticulatum, is situated on each side. At the point where the cord terminates, tlie pia mater becomes contracted, and is continued down as a long, slender filament (Jilum terminale), which | descends through the centre of the mass of nerves forming the cauda equina, and is blended with the impervious sheath of dura mater, on a level with the top of the saci'al canal. It assists in maintaining the cord in its position during the movements of the trunk, and is, from this circumstance, called the central liga- ment of the spinal cord. It contains a little nervous substance, which may be traced for some distance into its upper part, and is accompanied by a small artery and vein. Structure. The pia mater of the cord, though less vascular than that which invests the brain, contains a network of delicate vessels in its substance. It is also supplied with nerves, which are derived from the sympathetic, and from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. At the upper part of the cord, the pia mater presents a greyish, mottled tint, which is owing to yellowish or brown pigment cells being scattered within its tissue. The Ligamentum Denticulatum (fig. 253) is a narrow fibrous band, situated on each side of the spinal cord, throughout its entire length, and separating the anterior from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, having received its name from the serrated appearance which it presents. Its inner border is continuous with the pia mater, at the side of the cord. Its outer border presents a series of triangular, dentated serrations, the points of which are fixed, at intervals, to the dura mater, serving to unite together the two layers of the arachnoid membrane. These serrations are about twenty in number, on each side, the first being attached to the dura mater, opposite the margin of the foramen magnum, be- tween the vertebral artery and the hypoglossal nerve ; and the last near the lower end of the cord. Its use is to support the cord in the fluid by which it is surrounded. The Si'iNAL Coed. The spinal cord (medulla spinalis) is the cylindrical elongated part of the cerebro- spinal axis, which is contained in the vertebral canal. Its length is usually about sixteen or seventeen inches, and its weight, when divested of its membranes and nerves, about one ounce and a half, its proportion to the encephalon being about I to 33. It does not nearly fill the canal in which it is contained, its investing membranes being separated from the surrounding walls by areolar tissue and a plexus of veins. It occupies, in the adult, the upper two-thirds of the vertebral canal, extending from the upper border of the atlas to the lower border of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a slender filament of grey sub- stance, which is continued for some distance into i\iefilum terminale. In the foetus, before the third month, it extends to the bottom of the sacral canal; but, after this period, it gradually recedes from below, as the growth of the bones composing the canal is more rapid in proportion than that of the cord ; so that, in the child at birth, the cord extends as far as the third lumbar vertebra. Its position vanes also according to the degree of curvature of the spinal column, being raised some- what in flexion of the spine. On examining its surface, it presents a difference m its diameter in different parts, being marked by two enlargements, an upper or cervical, and a lower or lumbar. The cervical enlargement, which is the larger, extends from the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebi-a : its_ greatest diameter is in the transverse direction, and it corresponds with the origin of the "'^^'^^ which supply the upper extremities.

It contains a prolonga- tion from the pia mater ; and its floor is formed by the anterior white commissure, which is perforated by numerous blood-vessels, passing to the centre of the cord. The Posterior median fissure is much more deli- cate than the anterior, and most distract at the upper and lower parts of the cord. It extends into the cord to about one-half of its depth. It contains a very slender process of the pia mater, and numerous blood-vessels, and its floor is formed by a thin layer of white substance, the posterior white commissure. Some anatomists state that the bottom of this fissure corresponds to the grey matter, except in the cervical region, and at a point corresponding to the enlargement in the lumbar region. Lateral Fissu/res. On either side of the anterior median fissure, a linear series of foramina may be observed, indicating the points where the anterior roots of the spinal nerves emerge from the cord. This is called, by some anatomists, the antero-lateral fissure of the cord, although no actual fissure exists in this situation. And on either side of the posterior median fissure, along the line of attachment of the posterior roots of the nerves, a delicate fissure may be seen, leading down to the grey matter which approaches the surface in this situation : this is called the postero-lateral fissure of the spinal cord. On the posterior surface of the spinal cord, on either side of the posterior median fissure, is a slight longitudinal furrow, marking ofi" two slender tracts, the posterior median columns. These are mos distinct in the cervical region, but are stated by FovUle to exist throughont the whole length of the cord. Columns of the Cord. The fissures divide each half of the spinal cord into four columns, an anterior column, a lateral column, a posterior column, and a posterior median column. The anterior column includes all the portion of the cord between the anterior median fissure and the antero-lateral fissure, from which the anterior roots of the nerves arise. It is continuous with the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata. The lateral column, the largest segment of the cord, includes all the portion between the antero- and postero-lateral fissures. It is continuous with the lateral column of the medulla. By some anatomists, the anterior and lateral columns are included together, under the name of the antero-lateral column, which forms rather more than two-thirds of the entire circumference of the cord. The posterior column is situated between the posterior median and postero- lateral fissures. It is continuous with the restiform body of the medulla. The posterior median column is that narrow segment of the cord which is seen on each side of the posterior median fissure, usually included with the preceding, as the posterior column. Structure of the Cord. If a transverse section of the spinal cord be made, it 11 II 2468 NERVOUS SYSTEM. will be seen to consist of wliito and grey nervous substance. The white matter is situated externally, and constitutes the {greater part. The grey substance occupies the ccnti-o, and is so arranged as to present on the surface of the section two crescentic masses placed one in each lateiul half of the cord, united together by a transverse band of grey matter, the grey commissure. Each crescentic mass has an anterior and postei-ior horn. The posterior horn is long and narrow, and approaches the surface of the postero-lateral fissure, near which it presents a slight enlargement. The antei-ior born is short and thick, and does not quite reach the surface, but extends towards the point of attachment of the anterior roots of the nerves. Its margin presents a dentate or stellate appearance. Owing to the projections towards the surface of the anterior and posterior horns of the grey mattei-, each half of the cord is divided, more or less completely, into three columns, anterior, middle, and posterior: the anterior and middle being joined to form the autero-lateral column, as the anterior horn does not quite reach the surface. The grey commissure, whicb connects the two crescentic masses of grey matter, is separated from the bottom of the anterior median fissure by the anterior white commissure ; and from the bottom of the posterior fissure by the posterior white commissure. The grey comimissure consists of a transverse band of grey matter, and of white fibres, derived from the opposite half of the cord and the posterior roots of the nerves. The anterior commissure is formed of fibres, partly from tbe anterior column, and partly from the fibrils of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, which decussate as they pass across from one to the other side. The mode of arrangement of the grey matter, and its amount in proportion to the white, vary in different parts of the cord. Thus, the posterior horns are long and narrow, in the cervical region ; short and. narrower, in the dorsal; short, but wider, in the lumbar region. In the cervical region, the crescentic portions are small, the white matter more abundant than in any other region of the cord. In the dorsal region, the grey matter is least developed, the white matter being also small in quantity. In the lumbar region, the grey matter is more abundant than in any other region of the cord. Towards the lower end of the cord, the white matter gradually ceases. The crescentic portions of the grey matter soon blend into a single mass, which forms the only constituent of the extreme point of the cord. The minute anatomy of the cord is described in the Introduction. 256.—Transverse Sections of the Cord.

To examine the brain with its membranes, the skull-cap must he removed. In order to effect this, saw through the external table, the section couimeucing, in front, about an inch above the margin of the orbit, and extending, behind, to a level with the occipital protuberance. Then break the internal table with the chisel and hammer, to avoid injuring the investing membranes or brain; loosen, and forcibly detach the skull, when the dura mater will be exposed. The adhesion between the bone and the dura mater is very intimate, and much more so in the young subject than in the adult. The membranes of the brain are, the dura mater, ai-achnoid membrane, and pia mater.DURA MATER. 469 DuBA Mater. The dura mater is a thick and dense inelastic f the interior of the skull. Its outer surface is rough and f ""f ^^f^^^^^ closely to the inner surface of the bones, forming their f P^^^/^f^^^^^^^^^^ adhesL being more intimate opposite the sutures and at the b^^^^^ ^^/^^^^^^^ at the margin of the foramen magnum, it becomes _ continuous ^^l^J^^f f ^d mater lining the spinal canal. Its inner surface is smooth and epitheliated, being lined by the parietal layer of the arachnoid. Tho dura mater is, therefore a fibro-serous membrane, composed of an external fibrous lamella, and an internal serous layer. It sends numerous processes inwards, into the cavity ot the sJcuii for the support and protection of the different parts of the brain; and is prolonged to the outer surface of the skull, through the various foramma which exist at the base, and thus becomes continuous with the pericranium; its fibrous layer torms sheaths for the nerves which pass through these apertures. At the base ot tJie skuU, it sends a fibrous prolongation into the foramen CJBCum: it Unes the oltactory groove, and sends a series of tubular prolongations round tlae filaments ot the olfactory nerves as they pass through the cribriform plate ; a prolongation is also continued through the sphenoidal fissure into the orbit, and another is continued into the same cavity through the optic foramen, forming a sheath for the optic nerve, which is continued as far as the eyeball. In certain situations m tlie skull already mentioned, the fibrous layers of this membrane separate, to form sinuses for the passage of venous blood. Upon the upper surface of the dura mater, m the situation of the longitudinal sinus, may be seen numerous small whitish bodies, the glandute Pacchioni. Structure. The dura mater consists of white fibrous and elastic tissues,, arranged in flattened laminse, which intersect one another in every direction. Its arteries are very numerous, but are chiefly distributed to the bones. Those found in the anterior fossa, are the anterior meningeal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, and internal carotid. In the middle fossa are the middle and small meningeal, branches of the internal maxillary, and a third branch from the ascending pharyngeal, which enters the skull through the foramen lacerum basis cranii. In the posterior fossa, are the meningeal branch of the occipital, which enters the skull through the jugular foramen ; the posterior meningeal, from the vertebral; and occasionally meningeal branches from the ascending pharyngeal, which enter the skull, one at the jugular foramen, the other at tbe anterior con- dyloid foramen. The veins, whicb return the blood from the dura mater, and partly from the bones, anastomose with the diploic veins. These vessels terminate in the various sinuses, with the eiception of two which accompany the middle meningeal artery, and pass out of the skull at the foramen spinosum. The nerves of the dura mater are, the recurrent branch of the fourth, and filaments from the Casserian ganglion, from the ophthalmic nerve, and from the sympathetic. The so-called glandule Pacchioni are numerous small whitish granulations, nsually collected into clusters of variable size, w'hich are found in the following- situations:—I. Upon the outer surface of the dura mater, in the vicinity of the superior longitudinal sinus, being received into little depressions on the inner surface of the calvarium. 2. On the inner surface of the dura mater. 3. In the superior longitudinal sinus. 4. On the pia mater, near the margin of the hemi- spheres. These bodies are not glandular in structure, but consist of a fibro-cellular matrix originally developed from the pia mater ; by their growth they produce absorjjtion or separation of the fibres of the dura mater ; in a similar manner they make their way into the superior longitudinal sinus, where they are covered by the lining membrane. The cerebral layer of the arachnoid in the situation of these growths is usually thickened and opaque, and adherent to the parietal portion.470 NERVOUS SYSTEM. These bodies are not found in infancy, and very rarely until the third year. They are usually found after the seventh year; and from this period they increase in numher as age advances. Occasionally they are wanting. Processes of the Dura Mater. The processes of the dura mater, sent inwards into the cavity of the skull, are three in number, the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebolli, and tho falx ccrebelli. The falx cerebri, so named from its sickle-like form, is a strong arched process of the dura mater, which descends vertically in the longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the bi-ain. It is narrow in front, where it is attached to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone ; and broad behind, where it is connected with the upper surface of the tentorium. Its upper margin is convex, and attached to the inner surface of the skull as far back as the internal occipital protuberance. In this situation it is broad, and contains the superior longitudinal sinus. Its lower margin is free, concave, and presents a sharp curved edge, which contains the inferior longitudinal sinus. The tentorium cerehelU is an arched lamina of dura mater, elevated in the middle, and inclining downwards towards the circumference. It covers the upper surface of the cerebellum, supporting the posterior lobes of the brain, and pre- venting their pressure upon it. It is attached, behind, by its convex border, to the transverse ridges upon the inner surface of the occipital bone, and there encloses the lateral sinuses ; in front, to the superior margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, enclosing the superior petrosal sinuses, and from the apex of this bone, on each side, is continued to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes. Along the middle line of its upper surface, the posterior border of the falx cerebri is attached, the straight sinus being placed on their point of junction. Its anterior border is free and concave, and presents a large oval opening for the transmission of the crura cerebri. The falx cerehelU is a small triangular process of dura mater, received into the indentation between the two lateral lobes of the cerebellum behind. Its base is attached, above, to the under and back part of the tentorium ; its posterior margin, to the lower division of the vertical crest on the under surface of the occipital bone. As it descends, it sometimes divides into two smaller folds, which are lost on the sides of the foramen magnum. Arachnoid Membrane. The arachnoid {apa-^rt], elhoc, lilce a sjpider^s weh), so named from its extreme thinness, is the serous membrane which envelopes the brain, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the dura mater. Like other serous membranes, it is a shut sac, and consists of a parietal and a visceral layer. The parietal layer covers the inner surface of the dura mater,* and gives that membrane its smooth and polished surface ; it is also reflected over those surfaces which separate the hemispheres of the brain and cerebellum. The visceral layer invests the brain more loosely, being separated from direct contact with the cerebral substance by the pia mater, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, the subarachnoidean. On the upper surface of the cerebrum, the arachnoid is thin and transparent, and may be easily demonstrated by injecting a stream of air beneath it by means of a blow-pipe ; it passes over the convolutions withotit dipping down into the sulci between them. At the base of the brain the arachnoid is thicker, and slightly opaque towards the central part; it covers the anterior lobes, and is extended across between the two middle lobes, so as to leave a con- siderable interval between it and the brain, the anterior suharaclinoidean space ; it is closely adherent to the pons and under surface of the cerebellum ; but between • Kolliker denies this; and states, that tho inner surface of the dura mater is covered with pavement epithelium, hut has no other investment which can be regarded as a parietal layer of the arachnoid.THE BRAIN. 47t the hemisDheres of the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata another considerable ttie nemiapneres oi Tine uBiouui _ ^^^a i vosteriur siilarachnoidean space. interval is left between ifc and the bi-am, ^ ,,,3bri.

This space is tne seat of an abundant serous secretion, the cerebro-spinal fluid, which falls up t le interval between the arachnoid and pia mater. The subarachnoid space usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the bram by means ot an opening in the inferior boundary of the fourth ventricle. . The sac of the arachnoid also contains serous fluid; this is, however, small m quantity compared with the cerebro-spinal fluid. Structure. The arachnoid consists of bundles of white fibrous and elastic tissues intimately blended together. Its outer surface is covered with a layer of scaly- epithelium. It is destitute of vessels, and the existence of nerves m it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The cerehro-spinal fluid fiUs up the subarachnoid space, keeping the opposed surfaces of the arachnoid membrane in contact. It is a clear, limpid fluid, having a saltish taste, and a slightly alkaline reaction. According to Lassaigne, it consists of 98-5 parts of water, the remaining 1-5 per cent, being solid matters, animal and saline. It varies in quantity, being most abundant in old persons, and is quickly reproduced. Its chief use is probably to afford mechanical protection to tlie nervous centres, and to prevent the effects of concussions communicated from without. PiA Mateb. The pia mater is a vascular membrane, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. It consists of a minute plexus of blood-vessels, held together by an extremely fine areolar tissue. It invests the entire surface of the brain, dipping down between the convolutions and laminae, and is prolonged into the interior, forming the velum interpositum and choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle. Upon the surfaces of the hemispheres, where it covers the grey matter of the convolutions, it is very vascular, and gives off from its inner surface a multitude of minute vessels, which extend perpendicularly for some distance into the cerebral substance. At the base of the brain, in the situation of the sub- stantia perforata and locus perforatus, a number of long straight vessels are given off, which pass through the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. On the cerebellum the membrane is more delicate, and the vessels from its inner surface are shorter. Upon the crura cerebri and pons Varolii its characters are altogether changed ; it here presents a dense fibrous structure, marked only by slight traces of vascularity. According to Pohmann and Arnold, this membrane contains numerous lymphatic vessels. Its nerves are derived from the sympathetic, and also from the third, sixth, seventh, eighth, and spinal accessory. They accompany the branches of the arteries. The Bratn, The brain (enceplialon) is that portion of the cerebro-spinal axis that is con- tained in the cranial cavity. It is divided into four principal parts: viz., the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebrum forms the largest portion of the encephalon, and occupies a considerable part of the cavity of the cranium, resting in the anterior and middle472 NERVOUS SYSTEM. fossoo of the base of the skull, and separated posteriorly from the cerebellum by the tentorium cerebelli. About the middle of its under surface is a narrow con- stricted portion, part of which, the crura cerebri, is continued onwards into the pons Varolii below, and through it to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord; whilst another portion, the crura cei-ebelli, passes down into the cerebellum. Tlie cerebellum, (little brain or after brain) is situated in the inferior occipital fossa), being separated from the under surface of the posterior lobes of the cere- brum by the tentorium cerebelli. It is connected to the rest of the encephalon by means of connecting bands, called crura : of these, two ascend to the cerebrum, two descend to the medulla oblongata, and two blend together in front, forming the pons Varolii. The poiis Varolii is that portion of the encephalon which rests upon the upper pai't of the basilar process and body of the sphenoid bone. It constitutes the bond of union of the various segments above-named, receiving, above, the crura from the cerebrum ; at the sides, the crura from the cerebellum; and below, the medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata extends from the lower border of the pons Varolii to the upper part of the spinal cord, It lies beneath the cerebellum, resting on the lower part of the basilar groove of the occipital bone. Weight of the encephalon. The average weight of the brain, in the adult male, is 49-|- oz., or a little more than 3 lb. avoirdupois ; that of the female, 44 oz. ; the average diflPerence between the two being from 5 to 6 oz. The prevaihng weight of the brain, in the male, ranges between 46 oz. and 53 oz. ; and, in the female, between 41 oz. and 47 oz. In the male, the maximum weight out of 278 cases was 65 oz., and the minimum weight 34 oz. The maximum weight of the adult female brain, out of 191 cases, was 56 oz., and the minimum weight 31 oz. It appears that the weight of the' brain increases rapidly up to the seventh year, more slowly to between sixteen and twenty, and still more slowly to between thirty and forty, when it reaches its maximum. Beyond this period, as age advances and the mental faculties decline, the brain diminishes slowly in weight, about an ounce for each subsequent decennial period. These results apply alike to both sexes. The size of the brain appears to bear a general relation to the intellectual capacity of the individual. Cuvier's brain weighed rather more than 64 oz., that of the late Dr. Abercrombie 63 oz., and that of Dupuytren 62^ oz. On the other hand, the brain of an idiot seldom weighs more than 23 oz. The human brain is heavier than that of all the lower animals, excepting the elephant and whale. The brain of the former weighs from 8 lb. to 10 lb.; and that of a whale, in a specimen seventy-five feet long, weighed rather more than 5 lb. Medulla Oblongata. The medulla oblongata is the upper enlarged part of the spinal cord, and extends from the upper border of the atlas to the lower border of the pons Varolii. It is directed obliquely downwards and backwards; its anterior surface rests on the basilar groove of the occipital bone, its posterior surface is received into the fossa between the hemispheres of the cerebellum, forming the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is pyramidal in form, its broad extremity directed upwards, its lower end being narrow at its point of connection with the cord. It measures an inch and a quarter in length, three-quarters of an inch in breadth at its widest part, and half an inch in thickness. Its surface is marked, in the median line, in front and behind, by an anterior and posterior median fissure, which are con- tinuous with those of the spinal cord. The anterior fissure contains a fold of pia mater, and terminates just below the pons in a cul-de-sac, the foramen cajcum. The posterior is a deep but narrow fissure, continued upwards along the floor of the fourth ventricle, where it is finally lost. These two fissures diAn'dc the medulla into two symmetrical halves, each lateral half being subdivided byMEDULLA OBLONGATA. 473 minor grooves into four columns, which, from before backwards, are named the anterior pyramid, lateral trad and olivary hody, the redijorm hody, the podenor pyramid. •jit.

Anterior Surface. which is external to them, by a slight depression. At the lower border of the pons they are somewhat constricted; they then become enlarged, and taper slightly as they descend, being con- tinuous below with the anterior co- lumns of the cord. On separating the pyramids below, it will be observed that their innermost fibres form from four to five bundles on each side, which decussate with one another; this de- cussation, however, is not formed en- tirely of fibres from the pyramids, but mainly from the deep portion of the lateral columns of the cord which pass forwards to the surface between the di- verging anterior columns. The outer- most fibres do not decussate; they are derived from the anterior columns of the cprd, and are continued directly npwards through the pons Varolii. Lateral tract and olivary hody. The lateral tract is continuous with the lateral column of the cord. Below, it is broad, and includes that part of the medulla between the anterior pyramid and restiform body ; but, above, it is pushed a little backwards, and narrowed by the projection forwards of the olivary body. The olivary bodies are two prominent, oval masses, situated beliind the anterior pyramids, from which they are separated by slight grooves. They equal, in breadth, the anterior pyramids, are a little broader above than below, and are about half an inch in length, being separated, above from the pons Varolii by a shght depression. Numerous white fibres (fihrce arciformes) are seen winding round the lower end of each body ; sometimes crossing their surface. The restiform bodies (fig. 258) are the largest columns of the medulla, and con- tmuous, below, with the posterior columns of the cord. They are two rounded, cord-hke eminences, placed between the lateral tracts, in front, and the posterior pyramids, behind ; from both of which they are separated by slight grooves As they ascend, they diverge from each other, assist in forming the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle, and then enter the corresponding hemisphere of the cere- bellum forming its inferior peduncle ; it is probable that some fibres are continued irom the restiform bodies into the cerebrum. The posterior pyramids (fasciculi graciles) are two narrow, white cords placed one on each side of the posterior median fissure, and separated from the restiform bodies by a narrow groove. They consist entirely of white fibres, and are con- tinuous with the posterior median columns of the spinal cord. These bodies lie at first, in close contact. Opposite the apex of the fourth ventricle they form' an enlargement {processus davatus), and then, diverging, are lost i^ the corre- sponding restiform body.

In the middle line is seen a longitudinal farrow, continuous with the posterior median fissure of the cord, tomiinating, below, at the point of the ventricle, in a cul-de-sac, the ventricle of Arantius, which descends into the medulla for a slight extent. It is the remains of a ca- nal, which, in the foetus, extends through- out the entire length of the cord. Structure. The columns of the cord are directly continuous with those of the medulla oblongata, below; but, higher up, both the white and grey constituents are rearranged before they are con- tinued upwards to the cerebrum and cerebellum. The anterior pyramid is composed of fibres derived from the anterior column of the cord of its own side, and from the lateral column of the opposite half of the cord, and is continued upwards into the cerebrum and cerebellum. The cere- bellar fibres form a superficial and deep layer, which pass beneath the olivary body to the restiform body, and spread out into the structure of the cerebellum. A deeper fasciculus encloses the olivary body, and, receiving fibres from it, enters the pons as the olivary fasciculus or fillet; but the chief mass of fibres from the pyramid, the cerebral fibres, enter the pons in their passage upwards to the cerebrum. The anterior pyramids contain no grey matter. The lateral tract is continuous, below, with the lateral column of the cord. Its fibres pass in three difi-erent directions. The most external join the restiform body, and pass to the cerebellum. The internal, more numerous, pass forwards, pushing aside the fibres of the anterior column, and form part of the opposite anterior pyramid. The middle fibres ascend, beneath the olivary body, to the cerebrum, passing along the back of the pons, and form, together with fibres from the restiform body, the fasciculi teretes, in the floor of the fourth ventricle. i j > Olivary body. If a transverse section is made through either olivary body it will be found to consist of a small, ganglionic mass, deeply imbedded m the medulla partly appearing on the surface as a smooth, olive-shaped eminence (fag. 259;. it consists externally, of white substance; and, internally, of a grey nucleus, the r;uslntarm.

Above the decussation of the anterior pyramids, numerous white fibres extend, from behind forwards, in the median line, forming a septum, which subdivides the medulla into two lateral halves. Some of these fibres emerge at the anterior median fissure, and form a band whicb curves round the lower border of the olivary body, or passes transversely across it, and round the sides of the medulla, forming the arciform fibres of Eolando. Others appear in the floor of the fourth ventricle, issuing from the-posterior median fissure, and form the white striae in that situation. Grey matter of the medulla oblongata. The grey matter of the medulla is a con- tinuation of that contained in the interior of the spinal cord, besides a series of special deposits or nuclei. In the lower part of the medulla, the grey matter is arranged as in tbe cord, but at the npper part it becomes more abundant, and is disposed with less apparent regularity, becoming blended with all the white fibres, except the anterior pyramids. The part corresponding to the transverse grey commissure of the cord IS exposed to view in the floor of the fourth ventricle, by the divergence of the restiform bodies, and posterior pyramids, becoming blended with the ascending fibres of the lateral column, and thus forming the fasciculi teretes. The lateral crescentic portions, but especially the posterior horns, become enlarged, blend witii the tibres ot the restiform bodies, and form the tuberculo cinereo of iioianao. Special deposits of grey matter are found both in the anterior and posterior parts of the medulla; forming m the former situation, the corpus dentatum within the olivary body, and, m the latter, a series of special masses, or nuclei, connected with the roots of origin of the spinal accessoiy, vagus, glosso-pharyngeal, and hypoglossal nerves. It thus appears that the closest analogy ii structurJ, and476 NERVOUS SYSTEM. also probably in general endowments, exists between the medulla oblongatp, and the spinal cord. The larger size and peculiar form of the medulla depends on the enlargement, divergence, and decussation of the various columns ; and also on the addition of special deposits of grey matter in the olivary bodies and other parts, evidently in adaptation to the more extended range of function which this part of the cerebro-spiual axis possesses. Pons Varolii. The pons Varolii (inesocephale, Chaussior) is the bond of union of the various segments of the encephalon, connecting the cerebrum above, the medulla oblongata below, and the cerebellum behind. It is situated above the medulla oblongata, below the crura cerebri, and between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. Its under surface presents a broad transverse band of white fibres, which arches like a bridge across the upper part of the medulla, extending between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. This surface projects considerably beyond the level of these parts, is of quadrangular form, rests upon the sphenoid and basilar groove of the occipital bone, and is limited before and behind by very prominent margins. It presents along the middle line a longitudinal groove, wider in front than behind, which lodges the basilar artery ; numerous transverse strias are also observed on each side, which indicate the course of its superficial fibres. Its upper surface forms part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, and at each side it becomes contracted into a thick rounded cord, the crus cerebelli, which enters the substance of the cerebellum, constituting its middle peduncle. Structure. The pons Varolii consists of alternate layers of transverse and longi- tudinal fibres intermixed with grey matter (fig. 260). The transverse fibres connect together the two lateral hemispheres of the cere- bellum, and constitute its great transverse commissure. They consist of a super- ficial and a deep layer. The superficial layer passes uninterruptedly across the surface of the pons, forming a uniform layer, which consists of fibres derived from the crus cerebelli on each side, meeting in the median line. The deep layer of transverse fibres decussates with the longitudinal fibres continued up from the medulla, and contains much more grey matter between its fibres. The longitudinal fibres are continued up through the pons. i. From the anterior pyramid. 2. From the olivary body. 3. From the lateral and posterior columns of the cord, receiving special fibres from the grey matter of the pons itself. 1. The fibres from the anterior pyramid ascend through the pons, embedded between two layers of transverse fibres, being subdivided in their course into smaller bundles ; at the upper border of the pons they enter the crus cerebri, forming its fasciculated portion. 2. The olivary fasciculus divides in the pons into two bundles, one of which ascends to the corpora quadrigemina; the other is continued to the cerebrum with the fibres of the lateral column. 3. The fibres from the lateral and posterior columns of the cord, with a bundle from the olivary fasciculus, are intermixed with much grey matter, and appear m the floor of the fourth ventricle as the fasciculi teretes: they ascend to the deep or cerebral part of the crus cerebri. ■ n Foville believes that a few fibres from each of the longitudmal tracts ot the medulla turn forwards, and are continuous with the tra.nsverse fibres of the pons. Seftum. The pons is subdivided into two lateral halves by a median septum which extends through its posterior half. The septum consists of antero-posterior and transverse fibres. The former are derived from the floor of the fourth ven- tricle and from the transverse fibres of the pons, which bend backwards beiore passing across to the opposite side. The latter are derived from the floor of the fourth ventricle; they pierce the longitudinal fibres, and are then continued across from one to the other side of the medulla, piercing the antero-postcrior libies.CEREBRUM. 477 The two halves of the pons, in front, are connected together by transverse com- missural Hbres. Cererrum. Upper Surface. (Fig. 261.) The cerebrum, in man, constitutes the largest portion of the encephalon. Its upper surface is of an ovoidal form, broader behind than in front, convex in its general outline, and divided into two lateral halves or hemispheres, right and left; by the great longitudinal fissure, which extends throughout the entire length of the cerebrum in the middle line, reaching down to the base of the brain in front and behind, but interrupted in the middle by a broad transverse commissure of white matter, the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres together. This fissure lodges the falx cerebri, and indicates the original development of the brain by two lateral halves. Each hemisphere presents an outer surface, which is convex, to correspond with the vault of the cranium ; an inner surface, flattened, and in contact with the opposite hemisphere (the two inner surfaces forming the sides of the longitudinal fissure) ; and an under surface or base, of more irregular form, which rests, in front, on the anterior and middle fosssB at the base of the skull, and behind, upon the tentorium. Convolutions. If the pia mater is removed with the forceps, the entire surface of each hemisphere will be seen to present a number of convoluted eminences, the convolution.s, separated ffom each other by depressions (sulci) of various depths. The outer surface of each convolution, as well as the sides and bottom of the sulci between them, are composed of grey matter, which is here called the cortical substance. The interior of each convolution is composed of white matter ; and white fibres also blend with the grey matter at the sides and bottom of the sulci. By this arrangement the convolutions are adapted to increase the amount of grey matter without occupying much additional space, while they also afford a greater extent of surface for the termination of the white fibres in grey matter. On closer examination, however, the cortical substance is found subdivided into four layers, two of which are composed of grey and two of white matter. The most external is an outer white stratum, not equally thick over all parts of the brain, being most marked on the convolutions in the longitudinal fissure and on the under part of the train, especially on the middle lobe, near the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. Beneath this is a thick reddish-grey lamina, and then another thin white stratum; lastly, a thin stratum of grey matter, which lies in close contact with the white fibres of the hemispheres : consequently white and grey laminae alternate with one another in the convolutions. In certain convolutions, however, the cortical substance consists of no less than six layers, three grey and three white, an additional white stratum dividing the most superficial grey one into two; this is especially marked in those convolutions which are situated near the corpus callosum. There is no accurate resemblance between the convolutions in difierent brains nor are they symmetrical on the two sides of the same brain. Occasionally the free borders or the sides of a deep convolution present a fissured or notched appearance. The sulci are generally an inch in depth ; they also vary in diff-erent brainsj and in difierent parts of the same brain; they are usually deepest on the outer convex surface of the hemispheres ; the deepest is situated on the inner surface of the hemisphere, on a level with the corpus callosum, and corresponds to the pro- jection in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, the hippocampus minor The number and extent of the convolutions, as well as their depth, appear to bear a close relation to the intellectual power of the individual, as is shown in their increasing complexity of an-angement as we ascend from the lowest mam- malia up to man. _ Thus they are absent in some of the lower orders of mammalia, and they increase m number and extent through the higher orders. In man they present the most complex arrangement. Again, in the child at birth before theNERVOUS SYSTEM. 478 intellectual faculties are exercised, the convolutions have a very simple arrange- ment, presenting few undulations ; and the sulci between them are less deep than in the adult. In old age, when the mental faculties have diminished in activity, the convolutions become much less prominently marked. Those convolutions which are the largest and most constantly present, are the convolution of the corpus callosum, the convolution of the longitudinal fissure the supraorbital convolution, and the convolutions of the outer surface of the hemisphere. 261.—Upper Surface of the Brain, the Pia Mater having been removed. Great Zonffilitdliial Fcsmire The convolution of the corpus callosum (gyms fornicatus^ is always well marked. It lies parallel with the free surface of the corpus callosum, commencing on the under surface of the brain, in front of the anterior perforated space; it winds round the curved border of the corpus callosum, and passes along its upper surface as far as its posterior extremity, where it is connected with the convolutions of the posterior lobe ; it then curves downwards and forwards, embracing the cerebral peduncle, passes into the middle lobe, forming the hippocampus major, and termi- nates just behind the point from whence it arose. The supraorbital convolution on the under surface of tho anterior lobe is well marked. The convolution of the longitudinal fissure bounds tho margin of the fissure on the upper sui'face of the hemisphere. It commences on the under surface of the brain, at the anterior perforated space, passes forwards along the inner margin of the anterior lobe, being here divided by a deep sulcus, in which the olfactoryBASE OF THE BRAIN. 479 nerve is received; it then curves over the anterior and upper surface of the hemi- sphere alonff the margin of the longitudinal fissure, to its posterior extremity, where'it curves forwards along the under surface of the hemisphere as far as the '"''^The^ convolutions on the outer convex surface of the hemisphere, the general direction of whicli is more or less oblique, are the largest and most complicated convolutions of the brain, frequently becoming branched hke the letter Y in then- course upwards and backwards towards the longitudinal fissure : these convolutions attain their greatest development in man, and are especially characteristic of the human brain. They are seldom symmetrical on the two sides. Cerebrum. Under Surface or Base. (Fig. 262.) The under surface of each hemisphere presents a subdivision, as already mentioned, into three lobes, named from their position, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior lobe, of a triangular form, with its apex backwards,^ is somewhat concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the roof of the orbit, being separated from the middle lobe by the fissure of Sylvius. The middle hie, which is more prominent, is received into the middle fossa of the base of the skull. The posterior lobe rests upon the tentorium, its extent forwards being limited by the anterior margin of the cerebellum. The various objects exposed to view on the under surface of the cerebrum, in and near the middle hue, are here arranged in the order in which they are met with from before backwards. Longitudinal fissure. Tuber cinereum. Corpus callosum and its peduncles. Infundibulum. Lamina cinerea. Pituitary body. Olfactory nerve. Corpora albicantia. Fissure of Sylvius. Posterior perforated space. Anterior perforated space. Crura cerebri. Optic commissure. The longitudinal fissure partially separates the two hemispheres from one another; it divides the two anterior lobes in fi'ont: and on raising the cerebellum and pons, it will be seen completely separating the two posterior lobes, the inter- mediate portion of the fissure being filled up by the great transverse band of white matter, the corpus callosum. Of these two portions of the longitudinal fissure, that which separates the posterior lobes is the longest. In the fissure between the two anterior lobes the anterior cerebral arteries may be seen ascending to the corpus callosum; and at the back part of this portion of the fissure, the anterior curved portion of the corpus callosum descends to the base of the brain. The corpus callosum terminates at the base of the brain by a concave margin, which is connected with the tuber cinereum through the intervention of a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. This may be exposed by gently raising and drawing back the optic commissure. A broad white band may be observed on each side, passing from the under surface of the corpus callosum backwards and outwards, to the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius ; these bands are called the peduncles of the corpus callosum. Laterally, the corpus callosum extends into the anterior lobe. The lamina cinerea is a thin layer of grey substance, extending backwards above the optic commissure from the termination of the corpus callosum to the tuber cinereum; it is continuous on either side with the grey matter of the anterior perforated space, and forms the anterior part of the inferior boundaiy of the third ventricle. The olfactory nerve, with its bulb, is seen on either side of the longitudinal fissure, upon the under surface of each anterior lobe. The fissure of Sylviais separates the anterior and middle lobes, and lodges the.48o NERVOUS SYSTEM. middle cerebral artery. At its commencement is Heen a point of medullary sub- stance, corresponding to a subjacent band of wbite fibres, connecting the anterior and middle lobes, and called the fasciculus unaifurmis ; on following this fissure outwards, it divides into two brandies, which enclose a triangular-shaped promi- nent cluster of isolated convolutions, the island of Bell. These convolutions, from being covered in by the sides of the fissure, are called the gyri uperti. The anterior perforated s^gace is situated at the inner side of the fissure of Slvvius It is of a triangular shape, bounded in front by the convolution of the anterior lobe and the roots of the olfactory nerve ; behind, by the optic tract; externallv by the middle lobe and commencement of the fissure of blyvms; internally it is continuous with the lamina cinerea, and crossed by the peduncle of the corpus callosum. It is of a greyish colour, and corresponds to the under surface of the corpus striatum, a large mass of grey matter, situated in the interior of the brain ; it has received its name from being perforated by numerous minute apertures for the transmission of small straight vessels into the substance of the ^'^^V op/^tTomm«e is situated in the middle line, immediately behind the Inmina cinerea.

Erom the middle of its under surface a conica tubular process of grey matter, about two Imes in lerjgth, is continuous downward and forwards to be attached to the posterior lobe of the pituitary body ; this is the infundibulum. Its canal, which is funnel-shaped, communicates with the third ventricle. . „ , The pituitary body is a small reddish-grey vascular mass, weighing trom Hve to ten grains, and of an oval form, situated in the sella Turcica, in connection witJi which it is retained by the dura mater forming the inner wall of the cavernous sinus. It is very vascular, and consists of two lobes, separated from one another by a fibrous lamina. Of these, the anterior is the larger, of an oblong form, and somewhat concave behind, where it receives the posterior lobe, which is round. The anterior lobe consists externally of a firm yellowish-grey substance, and internally of a soft pulpy substance of a yellowish-white colour. The posterior lobe is darker than the anterior. In the foetas it is larger proportionally than in the adult, and contains a cavity which communicates through the infundibulum with the third ventricle. In the adult it is firmer and more solid, and seldom contains any cavity. Its structure, especially the anterior lobe, is similar to that of the ductless glands. The corpora albicantia are two small round white masses, each about the size of a pea, placed side by side immediately behind the tuber cinereum. They are formed by the anterior crura of the fornix, hence called the bulbs of the fornix, which, after descending to the base of the brain, are folded upon themselves, before passing upwards to the thalami optici. They are composed externally of white substance, and internally of grey matter; the grey matter of the two being connected by a transverse commissure of the same material. At an early period of foetal life they are blended together into one large mass, but become separated about the seventh month. The posterior perforated space {pons Tarini) corresponds to a whitish-grey sub- stance, placed between the corpora albicantia in front, the pons Varolii behind, and the crura cerebri on either side. It forms the back part of the floor of the third ventricle, and is perforated by numerous small orifices for the passage of blood- vessels to the thalami optici. The crura cerebri {peduncles of the Cerebrum) are two thick cylindrical bundles of white matter, which emerge from the anterior border of the pons, and diverge as they pass forwards and outwards to enter the under part of either hemisphere. Each crus is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and somewhat broader in front than behind. They are marked upon their surface with longitudinal striaa, and each is crossed, just before entering the hemisphere, by a flattened white band, the optic tract, which is adherent by its upper border to the peduncle. In the interior of the crura is contained a mass of dark grey matter, called locus niger. The third nerves may be seen emerging from the inner side of either crus ; and the fourth nerve winding round its outer side from above. Each crus consists of a superficial and deep layer of longitudinal white fibres, continued upwards from the pons : these layers are separated from each other by •the locus niger. The supeificial longitudinal fibres are continued upwards, from the anterior pyramids to the cerebrum. They consist of coarse fasciculi, which form the fi*ee part of the crus, and have received the name of the fasciculated portion of the peduncle, or crust. The deep layer of longitudinal fibres are continued upwards, to the cerebrum, from the lateral and posterior columns of the medulla and from the olivary IINERVOUS SYSTEM. 482 fasciculus, these fibres consisting of some derived from the same, and others from the opposite lateral tract of the medulla. More deeply, are a layer of finer fibres, mixed with grey matter, derived from the cerebellum, blended with the former. The cerebral surface of the crus cerebri is formed of these fibres, and is named the tegmentum. The locus niger is a mass of grey matter, situated between the superficial and deep layer of fibres above described. It is placed nearer the inner than the outer side of the crus. The posterior lobes of the cerebrum are concealed from view by the upper surface of the cerebellum, and pons Varolii. When these parts are removed, the two hemispheres are seen to be separated by the great longitudinal fissure, this fissure being interrupted, in front, by the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum. Geneiial Arrangement op the Parts composing the Cerebrum. As the peduncles of the cerebrum enter the hemispheres, they diverge from one another, so as to leave an interval between them, the interpeduncular space. As tliey ascend, the component fibres of each pass through two large masses of grey matter, the ganglia of the brain, called the thalamus opticus and cor^JK-s striatum, which project as rounded eminences from the upper and inner side of each peduncle. The hemispheres are connected together, above these masses, by the great transverse commissure, the corpus callosum, and the interval left between its under surface, the upper surface of the ganglia, and the parts closing the interpeduncular space, forms the general ventricular cavity. The upper part of this cavity is subdivided into two, by a vertical septum, the septum lucidum; and thus the two lateral ventricles are formed. The lower part of the cavity forms the third ventricle, which communicates witb the lateral ventricles above, and with the fourth ventricle, behind. The fifth ventricle is the interval left between the two layers composing the septum lucidum. Interior of the Cerebrum. If the upper part of either hemisphere is removed with a scalpel, about half an inch above the level of the corpus callosum, its internal white matter wiU be exposed. It is an oval-shaped centre, of white substance, surrounded on all sides by a narrow, convoluted margin of grey matter which presents an equal thickness in nearly every part. This white, central mass, has been called the centrum ovale minus. Its surface is studded with numerous minute red dots (puncta vasculosa), produced by the escape of blood from divided blood-vessels. In inflammation, or great congestion of the brain, these are very numerous, and of a dark colour. K the remaining portion of one hemisphere is slightly separated from the other, a broad band of white substance will be observed connecting them, at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure; this is the corpus callosum. The margins of the hemi- spheres, which overlap this portion of the brain, are called the lahiu cerelri. Each labium is part of the convolution of the corpus callosum (gyrus fornicatm), already described ; and the space between it and the upper surface of the corpus callosum has been termed the ventricle of the corpus callosum. The hemispheres should now be sliced off, to a level with the corpus callosum, when the white substance of that structure will be seen connecting together both hemispheres. The large expanse of medullary matter now exposed, surrounded by the convoluted margin of grey substance, is called the centnim ovale majiis of Vieussens. j 1. ^^ ^ The corpus callosum is a thick stratum of transverse fibres, exposed at tlie bottom of the longitudinal fissure. It connects the two hemispheres of the bram, forming their great transverse commissure ; and forms the roof of a space m the interior of each hemisphere, the lateral ventricle. It is about four inches in length, extending to within an inch and a half of the anterior, and to withm two mches483 CORPUS CALLOSUM. and a half of the posterior, part of the bram. It is somewhat broader behind than m front, and is thicker at either end than in its central part, being thickest behind. It presents a somewhat arched form, from before backwards, terminatmg anteriorly in a rounded border, which curves downwai-ds and backwards, between the anterior lobes to the base of the brain. In its course, it forms a distinct bend, named the Imee, ov genu, and the reflected portion, named the heah {rostrum), becoming gradually narrower, is attached to the anterior cerebral lobe, and is 263.—Section of the Brain. Made on a level with the Corpus Callosum. connected through the lamina cinerea with the optic commissure. The reflected portion of the corpus callosum gives off", near its termination, two bundles of white substance, which, diverging from one another, pass backwards, across the ^.nterior perforated space, to the entrance of the fissure of Sylvius, They are called the -peduncles of the corpus callosum. Posteriorly, the corpus callosum forms a thick, rounded fold, which is free for a little distance, as it curves forwards, and is then continuous with the fornix. On its upper surface, its fibrous structure is very apparent to the naked eye, being collected into coarse, transverse bundles. Along the middle line is a Unear depression, the raphe, bounded laterally by two or more slightly elevated longitudinal bands, called the strice longitudinales, or nerves of Lomcisi; and, still more externally, other longitudinal strioB are seen, beneath the convolutions which rest on the corpus callosum. These are the strice longitudinales laterales. The under surface of the corpus callosum is continuous behind with the fornix, being separated from it in front by the septum lucidum, which forms a vertical partition between the two ventricles. On either side, the fibres of the corpus callosum penetrate into the substance of the hemispheres, and connect together the anterior, middle, and part of the posterior lobes. It is the large 112484 NERVOUS SYSTEM. number of fibres derived from tlie anterior and posterior lobes which explains the great thickness of the two extremities of this commissure. An incision Bhould now be made through the corpus calloeum, on either side of the raphe, . ■when two large irregular-shaped cavities will be exposed, which extend through a great part i of the length of each hemisphere. These are the lateral ventricles. The lateral ventncles are serous cavities, formed by the upper part of the general ventricular space in the interior of the brain. They are lined by a thin diaphanous linino- membrane, covered with ciliated epithelium, and moistened by a serous 264.—The Lateral Ventricles of the Brain. fluid which is sometimes, even in health, secreted in considerable quantity. These cavities are two in number, one in each hemisphere, and they are separated from each other by a vertical septum, the septum lucidmn. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity, or body, and three smaller cavities or cornua, which extend from it in different directions. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards, into the substance of the anterior lobe. The posterior cornu, called the digital cavity, curves backwards into the posterior lobe. The middle cornu descends into the middle lobe. _ , • ^ if The central cavity, or body of the lateral ventricle, is triangular m form, it -hmmded above, by the under surface of the corpus callosum, which forms the of thVcav%.

The extraventncular portion is imbedded in the white substance of the hemisphere. The tcenia semicircularis is a narrow, whitish, semi-transparent band ot medullary substance, situated in tbe depression between the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus Anteriorly, it descends in connection with the anterior pillar ot the fornix- behind, it is continued into the descending horn of the ventricle, where it becomes lost. Its surface, especially at its fore-part, is transparent, and dense in structure, and this was called by Tarinus the horny hand. It consists of longi- tudinal white fibres, the deepest of which run between the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus. Beneath it is a'large vein (vena corporis striati), which receives numerous small veins fi'om the surface of the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, and joins the venas Galeni. The choroid plexus is a highly vascular, fringe-like membrane, occupying the margin of the fold of pia mater (velum interpositum), in the interior of the bram. It extends, in a curved direction, across the floor of the lateral ventricle. In front, where it is small and tapering, it communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite side, through a large oval aperture, the foramen of Monro. Posteriorly, it descends into the middle horn of the lateral ventricle, where it joins with the pia mater through the transverse fissure. In structure, it consists of minute and highly vascular villous processes, the villi being covered by a single layer of epitheHum, composed of large, round corpuscles, containing, besides a central nucleus, a bright yellow spot. The arteries of the choroid plexus enter the ven- tricle at the descending cornu, and, after ramifying through its substance, send branches into the substance of the brain. The veins of the choroid plexus termi- nate in the venae Galeni. The (corpus fimbriatum (tmnia hippocampi) is a narrow, white, tape-like band, situated immediately behind the choroid plexus. It is the lateral edge of the posterior pillar of the fornix, and is attached along the inner border of the hippo- campus major as it descends into the middle horn of the lateral ventricle. It may be traced as far as the pes hippocampi. The thalami optici and fornix will be described when more completely exposed, ' in a later stage of the dissection of the brain. The middle cornu should now be exposed, throughout its entire extent, by introducing the little finger gently into it, and cutting outwards, along the finger through the substance of the hemisphere, which should be removed, to an extent sufficient to expose the entire cavity. The middle, or descending cornu, the largest of the three, traverses the middle lobe of the brain, forming in its course a remarkable curve round the hack of the486 NERVOUS SYSTEM. t£ . !

At its lower extremity it becomes enlarged, and presents a number of rounded elevations with intervening depressions, which, from presenting some resemblance to the paw of an animal, is called the pes hippocampi. If a transverse section is made through the hippocampus major, it will be seen that this eminence is the inner surface of the convolution of the corpus callosum, doubled upon itself like a horn, the white convex portion projecting into the cavity of the ventricle; the grey portion bein" on the surface of the cerebrum, the edge of which, slightly indented, forms the fascia dentata.

Through this fissure the pia mater passes from the e^teuor ot the brain into the ventricles, to form the choroid plexuses Where the pia matei proiects into the lateral ventricle, beneath the edge of the fornix it is covered by a prolongation of the lining membrane, which excludes it from the cavity. The septum luddum (fig. 264) forms the internal boundary of the lateral ventricle. It is a thin, semi-transparent septum, attached, above to the under surface of the corpus callosum ; below, to the anterior part of the fornix; and, in front of this, to the prolonged portion of the corpus callosum. It is triangular m form broad in front, and narrow behind, its surfaces looking towards the cavities of the ventricles. The septum consists of two laminae, separated by a narrow interval, the fifth ventricle. . , n • , , Fifth Ventricle. Each lamina of the septum lucidum consists of an internal layer of white substance, covered by the lining membrane of the fifth ventricle ; and an outer layer of grey matter, covered by the lining membrane of the lateral ventricle The cavity of the fifth ventricle is lined by a serous membrane, covered with epithelium, and contains fluid. In the foetus, and in some animals, this cavity communicates, below, with the third ventricle ; but in the adult, it forms a separate cavity. In cases of serous effusion into the ventricles, the septum is often found softened and partially broken down. The fifth ventricle may he exposed by cutting through the septum, and attached portion of the corpus callosum, with scissors; after examining which, the corp^.s callosuni should be cut across, towards its anterior part, and the two portions carefully dissected, the one forwards, the other backwards, when the fornix will be exposed. The fornix (figs. 264, 265) is a longitudinal lamella of white fibrous matter, situated beneath the corpus callosum, with which it is continuous behind, but separated from it in front by the septum lucidum. It may be described as consisting of two symmetrical halves, one for either hemisphere. These two portions are joined together in the middle line, where they form the body, but are separated from one another in front and behind; forming the anterior and posterior crura. The body of the fornix is triangular ; narrow in front, broad behind. Its upper surface is connected, in the median line, to the septum lucidum in fi-ont, and the corpus callosum behind. Its under surface rests upon the velum interpositum, which separates it from the third ventricle, and the inner portion of the optic thalami. Its lateral edges form, on each side, part of the floor of the lateral ventricles, and are in contact with the choroid plexuses. The anterior crura arch downwards towaids the base of the brain, separated from each other by a narrow interval. They are composec). of white fibres, which descend through a quantity of grey matter in the lateral walls of the third ven- tricle, and are placed immediately behind the anterior commissure. At the base of the brain, the white fibres of each crus form a sudden curve upon themselves,NERVOUS SYSTEM. 488 spread out and form tlie outer part of tlie corresponding corpus albicans, from "wliicli point tbey may be traced upwards into the substance of the corresponding thalamus opticus. The anterior crura of the fornix are connected in their course with the optic commissure, the white fibres covering tlie optic thalamus, the peduncle of the pineal gland, and the superficial fibres of the tasnia semi- circtilaris. The j}osierior crura, at their commencement, are intimately connected by their upper surfaces with the corpus callosum ; diverging from one another, they pass downwards into the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, being con- tinuous with the concave border of the hippocampus major. The lateral thin edges of the posterior crura have received the name corpus fimbrialum, already described. On the under surface of the fornix, towards its posterior part, between the diverging posterior crura, may be seen some transverse lines, and others longitudinal or oblique. This appearance has been termed the lyra, from the fancied resemblance it bears to the strings of a harp. Between the anterior pillars of the fornix and the anterior extremities of the thalami optici, an oval aperture is seen on each side, the foramen of Monro. The two openings descend towards the middle line, and joining together, lead into the upper part of the third ventricle. These openings communicate with the lateral ventricles on each side, and below with the third ventricle. Divide the fornix across anteriorly, and reflect the two portions, the one forwards, the other backwards, when the velum interpositum will be exposed. The vehim interpositum (fig. 265) is a vascular membrane, reflected from the pia mater into the interior of the brain through the transverse fissure, passing beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum and fornix, and above the corpora quadrigemina, pineal gland, and optic thalami. It is of a triangular form, and separates the under surface of the body of the fornix from the cavity of the third ventricle. Its posterior border forms an almost complete investment for the pineal gland. Its anterior extremity, or apex, is bifid ; each bifurcation being continued into the corresponding lateral ventricle, behind the anterior crura of the fornix, forming the anterior extremity of the choroid plexus. On its under surface are two vascular fringes, which diverge from each other behind, and project into the cavity of the third ventricle. These are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. To its lateral margins are connected the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles. The arteries of the velum interpositum enter from behind, beneath the corpus callosum. Its veins, the vense Galeni, two in number, run along its under surface ; they are formed by the vense corporis striati and the veins of the choroid plexuses : the venae Galeni unite posteriorly into a single trunk, which terminates in the straight sinus. The velum interpositum should now be removed. This must he effected cai-efuUy, especially at its posterior part, where it invests the pineal gland; the thalami optici will then he exposed with the cavity of the third ventricle between them (fig. 266). The thalami optici are two large oblong masses, placed between the diverging portions of the corpora striata ; they are of a white colour superficially ; intei'nally, they are composed of white fibres intei-mixed with grey matter. Each thalamus rests Tipon its corresponding cms cerebri, which it embraces. Exfernalh/, it is bounded by the corpus striatum, and tcenia semicircularis ; and is continuous with the hemisphere, hdernally, it forms the lateral boundary of the third ventricle; and running along its upper border is seen the peduncle of the pineal gland. Its upper surface is free, being partly seen in the lateral ventricle ; it is partly covered by the fornix, and marked in front by an eminence, the anterior tubercle. Its wonder surface forms the roof of the descending coruu of the lateral ventricle; into it the crus cerebri passes. Its ptosterior and inferior part, which projects into the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, presents two small round eminences, theTHIRD VENTRICLE. 489 internal and external geniculate bodies.

The cavity of the third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, named, from their position, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior commissure is a rounded cord of white fibres, placed in front of the anterior crura of the fornix. It perforates the corpus striatum on either side, and spreads out into the substance of the hemispheres, over the roof of the descending horn of each lateral ventricle. The middle or soft commissure consists almost entirely of grey matter. It connects together the thalami optici, and is continuous with the grey matter lining the anterior part of the third ventricle. It is frequently broken in examining the brain, and might then be supposed to have been wanting. <NERVOUS SYSTEM. 49° The ^posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white band of fibres, connecting together the two thalami optici posteriorly. It bounds the third ventricle posteriorly, and is placed in front of and beneath the pineal gland, above the opening leading to the fourth ventricle. The third veukriolo has four openings connected with it. In front are the two I oval apertures of the foramen of Monro, one on either side, through which the third communicates with the lateral ventricles. Behind is a third opening leading into the fourth ventricle by a canal, the aqueduct of Sylvius, or iter a tertio ad quarlwm ventriculum. The fourth, situated in the anterior part of the floor of the ventricle, is a deep pit, which loads downwards to the funnel-shaped cavity of the infundibulum (iter ad infundihulum'). The lining membrane of the lateral ventricles is continued through the foramen of Monro into the third ventricle, and extends along the iter a tertio into the fourth ventricle ; at the bottom of the iter ad infundibulum, it ends in a cul- . de-sac. Grey matter of the third ventricle. A layer of grey matter covers the greater part of the surface of the third ventricle. In the floor of this cavity it exists in great abundance, and is prolonged upwards on the sides of the thalami, extending across the cavity as the soft commissure ; below, it enters into the corpora albicantia, and surrounds in part the anterior pillars of the fornix. Behind the third ventricle, and in front of the cerebellum, are the corpora quadrigemina ; and resting upon these, the pineal gland. The pineal gland (conarium), so named from its peculiar shape (pinus, a fir- cone), is a small reddish-grey body, conical in form, placed immediately behind the posterior commissure, and between the nates, upon which it rests. It is retained in its position by a duphcature of pia mater, derived from the under surface of the velum interpositum, which almost completely invests it. The pineal gland is about four lines in length, and from two to three in width, at its base, and is said to be larger in the child than in the adult, and in the female than in the male. Its base is connected with the cerebrum by some transverse commissural fibres, derived from the posterior commissure ; and by four slender peduncles, formed of medullary fibres. Of these, the two superior pass forwards upon the upper and inner margin of the optic thalami to the anterior crura of the fornix, with which they become blended. The inferior peduncles pass vertically downwards from the base of the pineal gland, along the back part of the inner surface of the thalami, and are only seen on a vertical section through the gland. The pineal gland is very vascular, and consists chiefly of grey matter, with a few medullary fibres. In its base is a small cavity, said by some to communicate with that of the third ventricle. It contains a transparent viscid fluid, and occasionally a quantity of sabulous matter, named acervulus cerebri, composed of phosphate and carbonate of lime, phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, with a little animal matter. ^ These concretions are almost constant in their existence, and are found at all periods of life. When this hodif is solid, the sabulous matter is found upon its surface, and occasionally upon its peduncles. On the removal of the pineal gland and adjacent portion of pia mater, the corpora quadrigemina are exposed. The corpora or tubercula quadrigemina {optic loles) are four rounded emi- nences placed in pairs, two in front, and two behind, and separated from one another by a crucial depression. They are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and posterior commissure, beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum, and above the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. The anterior pair, the nates', are the larger, oblong from before backwards, and of a grey colour. The posterior pair, the testes, are hemispherical in form, and lighter m colour than the preceding. They are connected on each side with the thalamus opticus, and commencement of the optic tracts, by means of two white prominent bands termed hrachia. Those connecting the nates with the thalamus {hrachia anieriom),STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 491 are the larger, and pass obliquely outwards. Those connecting the testes with the thalamus, are called the hracUa posteriora. Both pairs, m the adult, are quite solid, being composed of white matter externally, and grey matter within. These bodies are larger in the lower animals than in man. In fishes, reptiles, and birds, they are only two in number, are called the optic lohes, from their connec- tion with the optic nerves, and are hollow in their anterior; but in mammalia, they are four in number, as in man, and quite solid. In the human foetus, they are developed at a very early period, and form a large proportion of the cerebral mass ; at first, they are only two in number, as in the lower mammalia, and hollow in their interior. These bodies receive, from below, white fibres from the olivary fasciculus or fillet; they are also connected with the cerebellum, by means of a large white cord on each side, the processus ad testes, or superior peduncles of the cerebellum, which pass up to the thalami from the tubercula quadrigemina. The valve of Viettssens is a thin translucent lamina of medullary substance, stretched between the two processus e cerebello ad testes; it covers in the canal leading from the third to the fourth ventricle, forming part of the roof of the latter cavity. It is narrow in front, where it is connected with the testes ; and broader behind, at its connection with the vermiform process of the cerebellum. A slight elevated ridge, the frenulum, descends upon the upper part of the valve from the corpora quadrigemina, and on either side of it may be seen the fibres of origin of the fourth nerve. Its lower half is covered by a thin transversely grooved lobule of grey matter prolonged from the anterior border of the cerebellum ; this is called by the Italian anatomists the linguetta laminosa. The corpora geniculata are two small flattened, oblong masses, placed on the outer side of the corpora quadrigemina, and on the under and back part of each optic thalamus, and named, from their position, corpus geniculatum externum and internum. They are placed one on the outer and one on the inner side of each optic tract. In this situation, the optic tract may be seen dividing into two bands, one of which is connected with the external geniculate body and nates, the other being connected with the internal geniculate body and testes. Structure of the cerebrum. The white matter of each hemisphere consists of three kinds of fibres: i. Diverging or peduncular fibres, which connect the hemisphere with the cord and medulla oblongata. 2. Transverse commissural fibres, which connect together the two hemispheres. 3. Longitudinal commissural fibres, which, connect distant parts of the same hemisphere. The diverging or peduncular fibres consist of a main body, and of certain accessory fibres. The main body originate in the columns of the cord and medulla oblongata, and enter the cerebrum through the crus cerebri, where they are arranged into two bundles, separated by the locus niger. Those fibres which form the inferior or fasciculated portion of the crus, are derived from the anterior pyra- mid, and, ascending, pass mainly through the centre of the striated body ; those on the opposite surface of the crus, which form the tegmentum, are derived from the posterior pyramid and fasciculi teretes ; as they ascend, they pass, some through the under, part of the thalamus, and others through both thalamus and corpus striatum, decussating in these bodies with each other, and with the fibres of the corpus callosum. The optic thalami also receive accessory fibres from the processios ad testes, the ohvary fasciculus, the corpora quadrigemina, and corpora geniculata. Some of the diverging fibres end in the cerebral ganglia, whilst others pass through and receive additional fibres from them, and as they emerge, radiate into the anterior, middle, and posterior lobes of the hemisphere, decussating again with the fibres of the corpus callosum, before passing to the convolutions. These fibres have received the name of corona radiata. The transverse commissural fibres connect together the two hemispheres across the middle line.^ They are formed by the corpus callosum, and the anterior and posterior commissures. The longitudinal commissural fibres connect together distant parts of the same492 NERVOUS SYSTEM. j bemisphere, the fibres being disposed in a longitudinal direction. They form the . fornix, the tcenia semicirculai-is, and peduncles of the pineal gland, the strise m longitudinales, the fibres of the gyrus fornicatus, and the fasciculus unciformis, ■ The Cerebellum. ^ The Cerebellum, or little brain, is that portion of the encophalon which is con- ■I tained in the inferior occipital fossoB. It is situated beneath the posterior lobes of -1 the cerebrum, from which it is separated by the tentorium. Its average weight in 'i the male is 5 oz. 4 drs. It attains its maximum weight between the twenty-fifth and fortieth year ; its increase in weight after the fourteenth year being relatively o-reater in the female than in the male. The proportion between the cerebellum | and cerebrum is, in the male, as i to 8f; and in the female, as i to 8;^:. In the infant, the cerebellum is proportionally much smaller than in thd adult, the relation between it and the cerebrum being, according to Chaussier, between i to 13, and [ 1 to 26 ; by Cruveilhier the proportion was found to be i to 20. In form, the ' cerebellum is oblong, and flattened from above downwards, its greater diameter being from side to side. It measures from three and a half to four inches trans- versely, and from two to two and a half inches from before backwards, being about two inches thick in the centre, and about six lines at the circumference, which is the thinnest part. It consists of grey and white matter : the former, darker than that of the cerebrum, occupies the surface; the latter the interior. The surface of the cerebellum is not convoluted like the cerebrum, but traversed by numerous curved furrows or sulci, which vary in depth at difierent parts, and separate the lamina of which its exterior is composed. Its upper surface (fig. 267) is somewhat elevated in the median line, and depressed towards its circumference; it consists of two lateral hemispheres, connected together by an elevated median portion or lobe, the superior vermiform process. 267.—Upper Surface of the Cerebellum. The median lobe is the fundamental part, and in some animals, as fishes and reptiles the only part which exists ; the hemispheres being additions, and attaming their maximum size in man. The hemispheres are separated, m front, by a deep notch the mdstira cerehdU anterior, which encircles the corpora quadrigemina behind • they are also separated by a similar notch behind, the incisum cerehdh posterior, in which is received the upper part of the falx cerebelli. The superior vermifo m process (upper part of the median lobe of the cerebellum) extends from Ihe notch on the anterior to that on the posterior border. It is divided into three lobes • the lohulus centralis, a small lobe, situated in the incisura anterior ; themo«- Zalus cerebeUi, the central projecting part of the process; and the covunmura s^m. plex, a small lobe near the incisura posterior.493 CEREBELLUM. n Li. i,^ii,.r,i /•fio- 268") is subdivided into two lateral The under surface of the cerebellum (^S- ^^^^^^^^^ ^^.^^ ^.^^e backwards in hemispheres by a depression the valley, ^ ^^^^ ^^J^^^ ^1^^ i^f.^i^r occipital fosses; the middle line.

On each side ot the nodule is a thin layer of white substance, attached externally to the flocculus, and 268.—Under Siu^face of the Cerebellum. internally to the nodule; these form together the posterior medulla/ry velum, or commissure of the flocculus. It is usually covered in and concealed by the amygdalae, and cannot be seen until they are drawn aside. This band is of a semilunar form on each side, its anterior margin being free and concave, its posterior attached just in front of the furrowed band. Between it and the nodulua and uvula behind, is a deep fossa, called the siuallow's nest (nidus hirundinis). Loles of the cerebellum. Each hemisphere is divided into an upper and a lower portion by the great horizontal fissure, which commences in front at the pons, and passes horizontally round the free margin of either hemisphere, backwards to the middle line. From this primary fissure numerous secondary fissures proceed, which separate the cerebellum into lobes. Upon the upper surface of either hemisphere there are two lobes, separated from each other by a fissure. These are the anterior or square lobe, which extends as far back as the posterior edge of the vermiform process, and the posterior or semilunar lobe, which passes from the termination of the preceding to the great liorizontal fissure. Upon the under surface of either hemisphere there are five lobes, separated by sulci ; these are from before backwards ; the flocculus or sub-pedimcular lobe, a prominent taft, situated behind and below the middle peduncle of the cerebellum; its surface is composed of grey matter, subdivided into a few small laminre : it is sometimes called the pneumogastrio lobule, from being situated behind the'pneumo- gastric nerve. The amygdala or tonsil is situated on either side of the great medianNERVOUS SYSTEM. 494 269.—Vertical Section of tlie Cerebellum. fissure or valley, and projects into the fourth ventricle. The digastric lobe is situated on the outside of the tonsil, being connected in part with the pyramid. Behind the digastric is the slender lobe, which is connected witli the back part of the pyramid and the commissura brevis : and more posteriorly is the inferior posterior lobe, which also joins the commissura brevis in the valley. Structure. If a vertical section is made through either hemisphere of the cerebellum, midway between its centre and the superior vermiform process, the interior will be found to consist of a central stem of white matter, which contains in its interior a dentate body. From the surface of this central stem a series of plates of medullary matter are detached, which, covered with grey matter, form the laminte; and from the anterior part of each hemisphere arise three large processes or peduncles, supenor, middle, and inferior, by which the cerebellum is connected with the rest of the encephalon. The lamina} are about ten or twelve in number, including those on both surfaces of the cerebellum, those in front being detached at a right angle, and those beMnd at an acute angle; as each lamina proceeds outwards, other secondary laminae are detached from it, and, from these, tertiary laminae. The arrangement thus described gives to the cut surface of the organ a foliated appearance, to which the name arbor vitoe has been given. Each lamina consists of white matter, covered externally by a layer of grey substance. The white matter of each lamina is derived partly from the central stem : in addition to which white fibres pass from one lamina to another. The grey matter resembles somewhat the cortical substance of the convolutions. It con- sists of two layers: the external one, soft and of a greyish colour; the in- ternal one, firmer and of a rust colour. The corpus dentatum, or ganglion of the cerebellum, is situated a little to the inner side of the centre of the stem of white matter. It consists of an open bag or capsule of grey matter, the section of which pre- sents a grey dentated out- line, open at its anterior part. It is surrounded by white fibres ; white fibres are also contained in its interior, which issue from it to join the superior peduncles. The peduncles of the cerebellum, superior, middle, and inferior, serve to connect it with the rest of the encephalon. The superior pedmicles (processus e cerebello ad testes) connect the cerebellum •witli the cerebrum; they pass forwards and upwards to the testes, beneath which they ascend to the crura cerebri and optic thalami, forming part of the diverging cerebral fibres: each peduncle forms part of the lateral boundary of the fourth ventricle, and is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by the valve of Vienssens. The peduncles are continuous behind with the folia of the inferior vermiform process, and with the white fibres in the interior of the corpus dentatum. Beneath the corpora quadrigemina, the innermost fibres of each peduncle decussate with each other, so that some fibres from the right half of the cerebellum are continued to the left half of the cerebrum.495 FOURTH VENTRICLE.

They consist of a mass of curved fibres, which arise in the lateral parts of the cerebellum, and pass across to the same points on the opposite side. They form the transverse fibres of the pons Varolii. Fourth Venteicle. (Fig. 266.) The fourth ventricle, or ventricle of the cerebellum, is the space between the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons in front, and the cerebellum behind It is lozenge-shaped, being contracted above and below, and broadest across its central part. It is bounded laterally by the processus e cerehello ad testes above, and by the diverging posterior pyramids and restiform bodies below. The o-oof is arched ; it is formed by the valve of Vieussens and the under surface of the cerebellum, which presents, in this situation, four small eminences or lobules, the nodulus, uvula, and amygdala. The anterior boundary, or floor, is formed by the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons. In the median line is seen the posterior median fissure which becomes gradually obliterated above, and terminates below in the point of the calamus scriptorius, formed by the convergence of the posterior pyramids. At this point is the orifice of a short canal terminating in a cul-de- sac, the remains of the canal which extends in foetal life through the centre of the cord. On each side of the median fissure are two slightly convex longi- tudinal eminences, the fasciculi teretes : they extend the entire length of the floor, being indistinct below and of a greyish colour, but well marked and whitish above. Each eminence consists of fibres derived from the lateral tract and restiform body, which ascend to the cerebrum. Opposite the crus cerebelU, on the outer side of the fasciculi teretes, is a small eminence of dark grey substance, which presents a bluish tint through the thin stratum covering it; this is called the locus cairuleus; and a thin streak of the same colour continued up from this on either side of the fasciculi teretes, as far as the top of the ventricle, is called the tcenia violacea. The lower part of the floor of the ventricle is crossed by several white transverse lines, linecs tramsversce ; they emerge from the posterior median fissure; some enter the crus cerebelli, others enter the roots of origin of the auditory nerve, whilst some pass upwards and outwards on the floor of the ventricle. The lining membrane of the fourth ventricle is continuous with that of the third, through the aqueduct of Sylvius, and its cavity communicates below with the sub-arachnoid space of the brain and cord through an aperture in the layer of pia mater extending between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Laterally, this membrane is reflected outwards a short distance between the cerebellum and medulla. The choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle are two in number; they are delicate vascular fringes, which project into the ventricle on each side, passing from the point of the inferior vermiform process to the outer margin of the restiform bodies. The grey matter in the floor of the ventricle consists of a tolerably thick stratum, continuous below with the grey commissure of the cord, and extending496 NERVOUS SYSTEM. up as high as the aqueduct of Sylvius, besides some special deposits connected with the roots of origin of certain nerves. In the upper half of the ventricle is a projection situated over the nucleus, from which the sixth and facial nerves take a common origin. In the lower half are three eminences on each side for the roots of origin of the eighth and ninth nerves.

Icones.Cerebri et Medullaj Spinalis.'Cranial Nerves. rPHB Cranial Nerves, nine in ijumber on eacli side, arise from some part of the 1 cerebro-spinal centre, and are transmitted through foramina in the base of the cranium. They have been named numerically, according to the order in Tvhich they pass ont of the base of the brain. Other names are also given to them derived from the parts to which they arc distributed, or from their functions. Taken in their order, from before backwards, they are as follows. ist. Olfactory. - / Facial (Portio dura). 2nd. Optic. ^ 1 Auditory (Portio mollis). 3rd. Motor oculi. r Glosso-pharyngeal. 4th. Pathetic. 8th. < Pneumogastric (Par vagum). 5th. Trifacial (Trigeminus).

If, however, the 7th pair be considered as two, and the 8th pair as three distinct nerves, then their number wiU be increased to twelve, which is the arrangement adopted by Sommering. The cranial nerves may be subdivided into four groups, according to the peculiar function possessed by each, viz, nerves of special sense; nerves of common sensation; nerves of motion; and mixed nerves. These groups may be thus arranged:—• ' Nerves of Special Sense. Nerves of Motion. Olfactory. Motor oculi. Optic. Pathetic. Auditory. Part of third division of fifth. Part of glosso-pharyngeal. Abducens. Lingual or gustatory branch of fifth. Facial. Hypoglossal. Nerves of Common Sensation. Mixed Nerves. Fifth (greater portion). Pneumogastric. Part of glosso-pharyngeal. Spinal accessory. All the cranial nerves are connected to some part of the surface of the brain. This is termed their superficial, or apparent origin. But their fibres may, in all cases, be traced deeply into the substance of the organ. This part is called their deep, or o'eal origin. Olfactoet Nerve. (Fig. 262.) The First, or Olfactory Nerve, the special nerve of the sense of smell, may be regarded as a lobe, or portion of the cerebral substance pushed forward in direct relation with the organ to which it is distributed. It arises by three roots. The external, or long root, is a narrow, white, medullary band, which passes outwards across the fissure of Sylvius, into the substance of the middle lobe of the cerebrum. Its deep origin has been traced to the corpus striatum,* the superficial fibres of the optic thalamus,! the anterior commissure, J and the convolutions of the island of Reil. * Vieussens, Winslow, Monro, Mayo, t Valentin. t Cruveilhior. KKCRANIAL NERVES. 498 The middle, or grey root, arises from a papilla of grey matter (caruncula mam- millaris), imbedded in the anterior lobe. This root is prolonged into the nerve from the adjacent part of the brain, and contains white fibres in its interior, which are connected with the corpus striatum. The internal, or short root, is composed of white fibres, which arise from the inner and back part of the anterior lobe, being connected, according to Poville, •with tho longitudinal fibres of the gyrus fornicatus. These three roots unite, and form a flat band, narrower in tho middle than at either extremity, and of a somewhat prismoid form on section. It is soft in texture, and contains a considerable amount of grey matter in its substance. As it passes forwards, it is contained in a deep sulcus, between two convolutions, lying on the tinder surface of the anterior lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, and is retained in position by the arachnoid membrane which covers it. On reaching the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, it expands into an oblong mass of greyish- white substance, the olfactory bulb. From the under part of this bulb are given off numerous filaments, about twenty in number, which pass through the cribriform foramina, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the nose. Each filament is surrounded by a tubular prolongation from the dura mater, and pia mater ; the former being lost on the periosteum lining the nose ; the latter, in the neurilemma of the nerve. The filaments, as they enter the nares, are divisible into three groups : an inner group, larger than those on the outer wall, spread out over the upper third of the septum ; a middle set, confined to the roof of the nose ; and an outer set, which are distributed over the superior and middle turbinated bones, and the surface of the ethmoid in front of them. As the filaments descend, they unite in a plexiform network, and become gradually lost in the lining membrane. Their mode of termination is unknown. The olfactory differs in structure from other nerves, in containing grey matter in its interior, and being soft and pulpy in consistence. Its filaments are deficient in the wlute substance of Schwann, are not divisible into fibrillEe, and resemble the gelatinous fibres, in being micleated, and of a finely-granular texture. 270.—The Optic Nerves and Optic Tract. Optic Nerve. The Second, or Optic Nerve, the special nerve of the sense of sight, is distributed exclusively to the eyeball. The nerves of opposite sides are connected too-ether at the commissure ; and from the back of the commissure, they may be traced to the brain, under the name of the optic tracts. The optic trad, at its connection with the brain, is divided into two bands which arise from the optic thalami, the corpora geniculata, and the corpora quadrigemina. The fibres of origin from the thalamus may be traced partly from its surface, and partly from its interior. From this origin, the tract winds obliquely across the under surface of the crus cere- bri, in the form of a flattened band, desti- tute of neurilemma, and is attached to the crus by its anterior margin. It now as- sumes a cylindrical form, and, as it passes forwards, is connected with the tuber cinereum, and lamina cinerea, from both of which it i-eceives fibres. According to Foville, it is also connected with the tojuia semicircularis, and the anterior termination of the gyrus fornicatus. It finally joins with the nerve of the opposite side, to form the optic commissm-e.AUDITORY NERVE. 499 To OPTIC H. „„i,c>4- nnadrilateral in form, rests upon the The commissure or ^^""^^""'/^"^^t^'^^^'tn^^^^ in front, by the lamina optic groove of the sphenoid bone, ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ cinerea; behind, by the tnber cmereuna ; on eithei s y ^ ^.^^ space.

Some fibres are contmued aero s ' the r^terior border of the chiasma, and connect the ^^^^^^ gi^gg^ l^a^ing no relation with the optic tracts. They may be regarded as commissural fibres between the two retini (inter-retinal fibres). The outer fibres of each tract are contmued into the optic nerve of the same side. The central fibres of each tract are continued into the optic nerve of the opposite side, decussating in the commissure^with similar fibres of the opposite tract.* . „ The optio nerves arise from the fore part of the commissure, and, diverging irom one another, become rounded in form and firm in texture, and are enclosed m a sheath derived from the arachnoid. As each nerve passes through the correspond- ino- optic foramen, it receives a sheath from the dura mater; and as it enters the orbit, this sheath subdivides into two layers, one of which becomes continuous with the periosteum of the orbit; the other forms a sheath for the nerve, and sur- rounds it as far as the sclerotic. The nerve passes through the cavity of the orbit, pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats at the back part of the eyeball, a little to the nasal side of its centre, and expands into the retina. A small artery, the arteria centraUs retinae, perforates the optic nerve a little behind the globe, and runs along its interior in a tubular canal of fibrous tissue. _ It supplies the inner surface of the retina, and is accompanied by corresponding veins. AUDITOET NeRYE. The Auditory Nerve (fortio mollis of the seventh paii-) is the special nerve of the sense of hearing, being distributed exclusively to the internal ear. The portio dura of the seventh pair, or facial nerve, is the motor nerve of the muscles of the face. It will be described with the cranial motor nerves. The auditory nerve arises by numerous white stri», the linecB transversce, which emerge from the posterior median fissure in the anterior wall, or floor, of the fourth ventricle. It is also connected with the grey matter of the medulla, corresponding to the locus cseruleus. According to Foville, the roots of this nerve are connected, on the under surface of the middle peduncle, with the grey substance of the cere- bellum, with the flocculus, and with the grey matter at the borders of the calamus scriptorius. The nerve winds round the restiform body, from which it receives fibres, and passes forwards across the posterior border of the crus cerebelli, in company with the facial nerve, from which it is partially separated by a small ai'tery. It then enters the meatus auditorius, in company with the facial nerve, and, at the bottom of the meatus, divides into two branches, cochlear and vesti- bular, which are distributed, the former to the cochlea, the latter to the vestibule and semicircular canals. The auditory nerve is very soft in texture (hence the name, 2^ortio mollis), destitute of neurilemma, and, within the meatus, receives one or two filaments from the facial. The other nerves of special sense must be described with the glosso-pharyngeal and fifth nerves, of which they are parts. • A specimen of congenital nbsence of the optic commissure is to be found iu the Museum of the Westminster Hospital. IC K 2500 CRANIAL NERVES. Third Nekve. (Figs. 272, 273.) The Third Nerve {motor ociili) supplies all the muscles of the orbit, except the Superior oblique and Bxtcvnal rectus; it also sends motor filaments to the iris. It is a rather large nerve, of rounded form and firm texture, having its apparent origin from the inner surface of the cms cerebri, immediately in front of the pons Varolii. The decj) origin may be traced into the substance of the crus, Avhere some of its fibres are connected with the locus niger; others run downwards, among the longitudinal fibres of the pons ; whilst others ascend, to be connected with the tubercula quadrigemina, and valve of Vieussens. According to Stilling, the fibres of the nerve pierce the peduncle and locus niger, and arise from a grey nucleus in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius. On emerging from the brain, the nerve is invested with a sheath of pia mater, and enclosed in a prolongation from the arachnoid. It then pierces the dura mater on the outer side of the anterior clinoid process, where its serous covering is reflected from it, and it passes along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, above the other orbital nerves, receiving in its course one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. It tben divides into two branches, which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the External rec- 272.—Nerves of the Orbit. Seen from above, tus muscle. On passing throngb the fissure, the nerve is placed below the fourth, and the frontal and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic nerve. The superior division, the smaller, passes inwards across the optic nerve, and supplies the Superiorrectus and Levator palpebr^. The inferior division, tbe larger, divides into three branches. One passes be- neath the optic nerve to the Internal rectus; an- other to the Inferior rectus; and the third, the largest of the three, passes for- wards between the Inferior and External recti, to the Inferior oblique. From the latter, a short thick branch is given off to the lower part of the lenticular gan- glion, forming its inferior root, as well as two fila- ments to the Inferior rec- tus. All these branches enter the muscles on their ocular surface. FoDETH Nerve. (Fig. 272.) The FOTTRTH, or trochlear nerve, the smallest of the cranial nerves, supplies the Superior oblique muscle. It arises from the upper part of the valve of .-Vieussens, immediately behind the testis, and divides beneath the corpora quadri- gemina, into two fasciculi; the anterior one arising from a nucleus of grey matter, Mo'lor Tifatnrttf MatsrSIXTH. 501 .-,->, T £• 4.^^fl•^^,. flin Svlvian aqueduct; tlie postenoi-0110 oloqe to the middle Ime of the iioor 01 ttio o^ivi^ 1 ' { Close TO tue miuuiu ^. ^ tburbli ventricle, close to from a grey nucleus at the -PP- P-'^ °J '^^^^'^together at their the ongm ot the htth nerve '^ ^^^^^^''^^^^^^ ,,,3,,, the surface of the valve origin, by a transverse band of white ^^^^e , wb^o^ « ^^^^^^ of Vieussens.

It also gives ofi" a recurrent branch, which passes backwards between the layers of the tentorium, dividing into two or three filaments, which may be traced as far back as the wall of the lateral sinus. 273.—Nerves of the OrWt and Ophthalmic Ganglion.

Its apparent origin is by several filaments from the constricted part of the corpus pyramidale, close to the pons, or from the lower border of the pons itself. The deej) origin of this nerve has been traced, by Mayo, between the fasciculi of the corpus pyramidale, to the posterior part of the medulla, where Stilling has shown its connection with a grey nucleus in the floor o£ the fourtb ventricle. The nerve pierces the dura mater, immediately below the posterior clinoid process, lying in a groove by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone. It passes for- wards through the cavernous sinus, lying on the outer side of the internal carotid artery, where it is joined by several filaments from the cairotid plexus, by one from Meckel's ganglion (Bock), and another from the ophthalmic nerve. It enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and lies above the ophthalmic vein, from which it is separated by a lamina of dura mater. It then passes between the two heads of the External rectus, and is distributed to that muscle on its ocular surface. The above-mentioned nerves, as well as the ophthalmic division of the fifth,S02 CRANIAL NERVES. they pass to tlie orbit, bear a certain relation to each other in the cavernous sinus, at the sphenoidal fissure, and in the cavity of the orbit, which will be now described. In the cavernous sinns, the third, fourth, and ophthalmic division of the fifth, are placed in the dura mater of the outer wall of the sinus, in their numerical order, both from above downwards, and from within outwards. The sixth nerve lies at the outer side of the internal carotid artery. As these nerves pass forwards to the sphenoidal fissure, the third and fifth nerves become divided into branches, and the sixth approaches the rest; so that their relative position becomes consi- derably changed. In the sphenoidal fissure, the fourth, and the frontal and lachyrmal divisions of the ophthalmic, lie upon the same plane, the former being most internal, the latter external; and they enter the cavity of the orbit above the muscles. The remaining nerves enter the orbit between the two heads of the External rectus. The superior division of the third is the highest of these ; beneath this lies the nasal branch of the fifth; then the inferior division of the third; and the sixth lowest of all. In the orhit, the fourth, and the frontal and lachyrmal divisions of the ophthal- mic. He on the same plane immediately beneath the periosteum, the fourth nerve being internal and resting on the Superior oblique, the frontal resting on the Levator palpebrse, and the lachrymal on the External rectus. Next in order comes the superior division of the third nerve lying immediately beneath the Superior rectus, and then the nasal division of the fifth crossing the optic nerve from the outer to the inner side of the orbit. Beneath these is found the optic nerve, sur- rounded in front by the ciliary nerves, and having the lenticular ganglion on its outer side, between it and the External rectus. Below the optic is the inferior division of the third, and the sixth, which Hes on the outer side of the orbit. Eacux Neeve. The Facial Nerve, or 'portio dura of the seventh pair, is the motor nerve of all the muscles of expression in the face, and of the Platysma and Buccinator. It supplies also two of the muscles of the external ear, the posterior belly of the Digastric, and the Stylo-hyoid. Through the chorda tympani it supplies the Lingualis ; by its tympanic branch, the Stapedius and Laxator tympani; through the otic ganglion, the Tensor Tympani ; and through the connection of its trunk with the Vidian nerve, by the petrosal nerve, it probably supplies the Levator palati and Azygos uvulre. It arises from the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata, in the groove between the oHvary and restiform bodies. Its deep origin may be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle, where it is connected with the same nucleus as the sixth nerve. This nerve is situated a little nearer to the middle line than the portio mollis, close to the lower border of the pons Varolii, from which some of its fibres are derived. Connected with this nerve, and lying between it and the portio mollis, is a small fasciculus (portio inter duram et mollem of Wrisberg, or portio intermedia). This ac- cessory portion arises from the lateral column of the cord. The nerve passes forwards, and outwards upon the crus cerebelli, and enters the in- ternal auditory meatus witli tbo auditory nerve. Within the meatus, the facial nerve lies firs-t to the imier side of the auditory, and then in a groove uipon that nerve, ana is conn^ or two filaments. 274.

The Ghorda tymjoani is given o(l' I'rom the facial as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of tlio tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It ascends from below upwards in a distinct canal, parallel with the aqurocluctns Fallopii, and enters the cavity of the tym- panum through an opening (iter chordoj posterius) between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested 275—The Nerves of the Scalp, Face, nnd Side of the Neck. with mucous membrane. It passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen at the inner side of the Glaserian fissure which is called the iter chordas anterius, or canal of Huguier. It then descends between the two Pterygoid muscles, and meets the gustatory nerve at an acnte angle, after communicating with which, it accompanies it to the submaxillary gland ; it then joins the submaxillary ganglion, and termi- nates in the Lingualis muscle. The Posterior av/ricular nerve ai'ises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards in front of the mastoid process, where it is joined by a filament from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, and communicates with the deepNINTH, OR HYPOGLOSSAL. 505 , . 1 • „ :j. jpanpnds between the meatus and mastoid branch of the auneularis magnus ; as ^e^^tlzar hrwnoh supplies the Retraheus proeess it divides mto two bi-anches ^^^"^ the superior aurem.

The Digastric 6, usually arises by a common trunk with the precedmg it divides into several filaments, which supply the posterior belly of the Uigastiic , one of these perforates that muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Temporo-facial, the larger of the two terminal branches, passes iip™s and forwards through the parotid gland, crosses the neck of the condyle ot tne jaw, being connected in this situation with the auriculo-temporal branch ot tlie inferior maxillary nerve, and divides into branches, which are distributed over the temple and upper part of the face ; these are divided into three sets, temporal, malar, and infraorbital. The temporal Iranches cross the zygoma to the temporal region, supplying the Attrahens aurem muscle, and join with the temporal branch of the superior maxillary, and with the auriculo-temporal branch of the mferior maxillary. The more anterior branches snpply the frontal portion of the Occipito-frontalis, and the Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, joining with the supraorbital branch of the ophthalmic. The malar brandies pass across the malar bone to the outer angle of the orbit, where they supply the Orbicularis and Corrugator superciHi muscles, joining with filaments from the lachrymal and supraorbital nerves: others supply the lower eyelid, joining with filaments of the malar branches of the superior maxillary nerve. The infraorhital, of larger size than the rest, pass horizontally forwards to be distributed between the lower margin of the orbit and the mouth. The superficial brandies run beneath the skin and above the superficial muscles of the face, which they supply; some supply the lower eyelid and Pyramidalis nasi, joining at the inner angle of the orbit, with the infratrochlear and nasal branches of the ophthal- mic. The deep branches pass beneath the Levator labii superioris^ supply it and the Levator anguli oris, and form a plexus (infraorbital) by joining with the infraorbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The Gervico-facial division of the facial nerve passes obliquely downwards and forwards through the parotid gland, where it is joined by branches from the great auricular nerve; opposite the angle of the lower jaw it divides into branches which are distributed on the lower half of the face and upper part of the neck. These may be divided intO' three sets: buccal, supramaxillary,. and infra- maxillary. The buccal branches cross the Masscter muscle, join the infraorbital branches of the temporo-facial division of the nerve, and with filaments of the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. They supply the Buccinator and' Orbi- cularis oris. The supramaxillanj branches pass forwards beneath the Platysma and Depressor anguli oris, supplying the muscles of the lip and chin, and anastomosing with the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve. The inframaxillary branches run forward beneath the Platysma, and form a series of arches, across the side of the neck over the supra-hyoid region. One of these branches descends vertically to join with the superficial cervical nerve from the cervical plexus ; others supply the Platysma. Ninth, or Hypoglossal Nervu. The Ninth Nerve {hypoglossal) is the motor nerve of tlve tongue. It arises by several filaments, from ten to fifteen in number, from the groove between theCRANIAL NERVES. 5o6 pyramidal aud oHvaiy bodies, in a continuous line wifcli the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. According to Stilling, these roots may be traced to a grey nucleus m the floor of the motlulla oblongata, between the posterior median furrow and the nuclei of the glosso-pliaryngcal and vagus nerves. Tlie filaments of this nerve are collected into two bundles, which perforate the dura mater separately, 276.—Hypoglossal Nerve, Cervical Plexus, and their Branches. opposite the anterior condyloid foramen, and unite together after their passage through it. In those cases in which the anterior condyloid foramen in the occi- pital bone is double, these two portions of the nerve are separated by a small piece of bone, which divides the foramen. The nerve descends almost vertically to a point corresponding with the angle of the jaw. It is at first deeply seated beneath the internal carotid and internal jugular vein, and intimately connected with the pneuniogastric nerve ; it then passes forwards between the vein and artery, and at a lower part of the neck becomes superficial below the Digastric muscle. The nerve then loops round the occipital artery, and crosses the external carotid below the tendon of the Digastric muscle. It passes beneath the Mylo- hyoid muscle, lying between it aaid the Hyo-glossus,. and is connected at the anterior border of the latter muscle with the gustatory nerve ; it is tlien continued forwards into the Genio-hyo-glossua, muscle as far sra the tip of the tongue, dis- tributing branches to its substance.FIFTH. 507 Branclies of this nerve communicato with the „ . • ■pirst and second cervical nerves.

The communication with the pnoumogastric takes place close to the exit of the nerve from the skull, numerous filaments passing between the hypoglossal and second ganglion of the pneumogastric, or both bemg united so as to foim one mass. The communication with the sympathetic takes place opposite the atlas by branches derived from the superior cervical ganglion, and in the same situation the ninth is joined by a fUament derived from the loop connecting the first two cervical nerves. . • t, ;j p The communication with the gustatory takes place near the anterior border 01 the Hyo-glossus muscle by numerous filaments which ascend upon it. The branches of the distribution are the Descendens noni. Thyro-hyoid. Muscular. The descendens noni is a long slender branch, which quits the hypoglossal where it turns round the occipital artery. It descends obliquely across the sheath of the carotid vessels, and joins just below the middle of the neck, to form a loop with the communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves. From the convexity of this loop branches pass forwards to supply the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, and both bellies of the Omo-hyoid. According to Arnold, another filament descends in front of the vessels into the chest, which joins the cardiac and phrenic nerves. The descendens noni is occasionally contained in the sheath of the carotid vessels, being- sometimes placed over and sometimes beneath the internal jugular vein. The ilmjro-liyoid is a small branch, arising from the hypoglossal near the pos- terior border of the Hyo-glossus ; it passes obliquely across the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and supplies the Thyro-hyoid muscle. The muscidar branches are distributed to the Stylo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Genio-hyoid, and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles. At the under sui-face of the tongue, numerous slender branches, pass upwards into the substance of the organ. Fifth Nervs. The Fifth Nerve {trifacial, tri'gemim^) is the largest cranial nerve, and resembles a spinal nerve, in its origin by two roots, and in the existence of a ganghou on its posterior root. The functions of this- nei've are various. It is a nerve of special sense, of common sensation, and of motion. It is the great sen- sitive nerve of the head and face, the motor nerve of the muscles of mastication, and its lingual branch is one of the nerves of the special sense of taste. It arises by two roots, a posterior larger or sensory, and an anterior smaller or motor root. Its superficial origin is from the side of the pons Yarolii, a little nearer to the upper than the lower border. The smaller root consists of three or four bundles ; in the larger, the bundles are more numerous, varying in number from seventy to a hundred : the two roots are separated from one another by a few of the trans- verse fibres of the pons. The f^eep origin of the larger or sensory root may bo traced between the transverse fibres of the pons Varolii to the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata, immediately behind the olivary body. According to some anatomists, it is connected with the grey nucleus at the back part of the medulla, between the fasciculi teretes and restiform columns. By others, it is said to be continuous with the fasciculi teretes and lateral column of the nord ; and, according to Foville, some of its fibres are connected with the transverse fibres of the pons ; whilst others enter the cerebellum, spreading out on the surface of its middle peduncle. The motor root has been traced by Bell and Rctziiis to be connected witb the pyramidal body. The two roots of the nerve pass- forwards throiagh anCRANIAL NERVES. oval opening in the dura mater, opposite the internal auditory meatus : hero the fibres of the lai-ger root enter a large semilunar ganglion (Casserian), while the smaller root passes beueatli the gangh'on without having any connection with it and joins outside the cranium witli one of the trunks derived fi-oin it. ' The Casserian, or Semilunar GANanoN, is lodged in a depression near the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It is of a somewhat crcscentic form •with its convexity turned forwards. Its ujjper surface is intimately adherent to tbe dura mater. Branches. This ganglion receives, on its imier side, filaments from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic ; and from it some minute branches are given off to the tentorium cerebelli, and the dura mater, in the middle fossa of the cranium. From its anterior harder, which is directed forwards and outwards, three large branches proceed: the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. The ophthalmic and superior maxillary consist exclusively of fibres derived from the larger root and ganglion, and are solely nerves of common sensation. The third division, or inferior maxillary, is composed of fibres from both roots. This, there- fore, strictly speaking, is the only portion of the fifth nerve which can be said to resemble a spinal nerve. Ophthalmic Neuve. (Fig. 272.) The Ophthalmic, or first division of the fifth, is a sensory nerve. It supplies the ej^eball, the lachrymal gland, the mucous lining of the eye and nose, and the integument and muscles of the eyebrow and forehead. It is the smallest of the three divisions of the fifth, arising from the upper part of the Casserian gan- glion. It is a short, flattened band, about an inch in length, which passes for- wards along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, below the other nerves, and just before entering the orbit, through, the sphenoidal fissure, divides into three branches, lachrymal, frontal, and nasal. The ophthalmic nerve is joined by fila- ments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, and gives off" recurrent filaments which pass between the layers of the tentorium, with a branch from the fourth nerve. Its brancbes are, the Lachrymal. Frontal. Nasal. The Laclmjmal is the smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic. Not unfrequently it arises by two filaments, one from the ophthalmic, the other from the fourth, and this Swan considers to be its usual condition. It passes forwards in a separate tube of dura mater, and enters the orbit through the narrowest part of the spbenoidal fissure. In the orbit,, it runs along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, witb the lachrymal arteiy, and is connected with the orbital brancb of the superior maxillary nerve. Within the lachrymal gland it gives ofi" several filaments, which supply the gland and the conjunctiva. Finally, it pierces the palpebral ligaments, and terminates in the integument of the upper eye- lid, joining witb filaments of the facial nerve.. The Frontal is the largest division of the ophthalmic, and may be regarded, both from its size and direction, as the continuation of this nerve. It enters the orbit above the muscles, through the highest and broadest part of the sphenoidal fissure, and runs forwards along the middle line, between the Levator palpebrte and the periosteum. Midway between the apex and base of the orbit it divides into two branches, supratrochlear, and supraorbital. The stcpratrocJdear hrancJi,- the smaller of the tw©, passes inwards, above the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle, and gives off^ a descending filament, which joins witb the infratrochlear branch of the nasal nerve. It then escapes from the orbit between the pulley of the Superior oblique and the supraorbital foramen, curves up on to the forehead close to the bonc^ and ascends behind the Corrugator supercilii, and Occipito-frontalis muscles, to both of whicb it is distributed; iinally, it is lost in the integument of the forehead.OrHTHALMIC GANGLION. 5o9 The irancn passes ^or^^^Zl^^^^ gives off, in this situation F^lP^^- "^^^^^^^^^ and pericranial upon the forehead, and ^f^^^^^^ ,"^^^0 CoVrugator supercilii, Occipito- branches.

It then enters the cavity of the cranium traverses a shallow groove on the front of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and passes down, through the slit by the side of the crista galh, into the nose, where it divides into two branches, an internal and an external. iHe internal Irancli supplies the mucoas membrane near the fore part of the septuna of the nose. The external hranch descends in a groove on the inner surface ot the nasal bone, and supphes a few filaments to the mucous membrane covering the fore part of the outer wall of the nares as far as the inferior spongy bone ; it then leaves the cavity of the nose, between the lower border of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage of the nose, and, passing down beneath the Com- pressor nasi, supplies the integument of the ala and the tip of the nose, joining with the facial nerve. The branches of the nasal nerve are, the ganglionic, ciliary, and infratrochlear. The ganglionic is a long, slender branch, about half an inch in length, which usually arises from the nasal, between the two heads of the external rectus. It passes forwards on the outer side of the optic nerve, and enters the superior and posterior angle of the ciliary ganglion, forming its superior, or long root. It is sometimes joined by a filament from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, or from the superior division of the third nerve. The long ciliary nerves, two or three in number, are given off from the nasal as it crosses the' optic nerve. They join the short ciliary nerves from the ciliary gan- glion, pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and, running forwards between it and the choroid, are distributed to the ciliary muscle and iris. The infratrochlear hranch is given off just as the nasal nerve passes through the anterior ethmoidal foramen. It runs forwards along the upper border of the Internal rectus, and is joined, beneath the pulley of the Superior oblique, by a filament from the supratrochlear nerve. It then passes to the inner angle of the eye, and supplies the Orbicularis palpebrarum, the integument of the eyelids, and side of the nose, the conjunctiva, lachryrhal sac, and caruncula lachrymalis. Ophthalmic Gangliok. (Fig. 273.) Connected with the three divisions of the fifth nerve are four small ganglia, which form the whole of the cephalic portion of the sympathetic. "With the first division is connected the ophthalmic ganglion ; with the second division, the spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion; and with the third, the otic and sub- maxillary ganglia. All the four receive sensitive filaments from the fifth, and motor and sympathetic filaments from various sources ; these filaments are called the roots of the ganglia. The ganglia are also connected with each other, and with the cervical portion of the sympathetic.CRANIAL NERVES. Tho O^hlhalmic, Lenticular, or Ciliarij Gancjlion, is a small, quadrangular flattened ganglion, of a roddisli-groy colour, and about tlie size of a pin's head, situated at the back part of tlie orbit betvvocu the optic nerve and the External Rectus muscle lying generally on the outer side of the ophthalmic artery. It is enclosed in a quantity of loose fat, which makes its dissection somewhat difficult. Its branches of commnnicaiion, or roots, are three, all of which enter its posterior border. One, tho long root, is derived from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and joins its superior angle. The second, the short root, is a short thick nerve, occasionally divided into two parts, which is derived from the branch of the thii-d nerve for the inferior oblique muscle, and is connected with the inferior angle of the gaughon. Tlie third, the sympathetic root, is a slender filament from the cavernous plexus of tho sympathetic. This is occasionally blended with the long root, and sometimes passes to the ganglion separately. According to Tiedemann, this ganglion receives a filament of communication from the spheno- palatine ganglion. Its hranolies of clistrihution are the short ciliary nerves. These are delicate filaments from ten to twelve in number, which arise from the fore part of the ganglion in two bundles, connected with its superior and inferior angles ; the upper bundle consisting of four filaments, and the lower of six or seven. They run forwards with the ciliary arteries in a wavy course, one set above and the other below the optic nerve, pierce the sclerotic at the back part of the globe, pass forwards in delicate grooves on its inner surface, and are distributed to the ciliary muscle and iris. A small filament is described by Tiedemann, penetrating the optic nerve with the arteria centralis retinte. SuPEEiOE Maxillary Nerve. (Fig. 277.) The Superior Maxillary, or second division of the fifth, is a sensory nerve. It is intermediate, both in position and size, between the ophthalmic and inferior maxillary. It commences at the middle of the Casserian ganglion as a flattened plexiform band, and passes forwards through the foramen rotundum, where it becomes more cylindrical in form, and firmer in texture. It then crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa, traverses the infraorbital canal in the floor of the orbit, and appears upon the face at the infraorbital foramen. At its termination, the nerve lies beneath the Levator labii superioris muscle, and divides into a leash of branches, which spread out upon the side of the nose, the lower eyelid, and upper lip, joining with filaments of the facial nerve. The branches of this nerve may be divided into three groups :—i. Those given off in the spheno-maxillary fossa. 2. Those in the infraorbital canal. 3. Those on the face. r Orbital.

The Orhital branch ai-ises in the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides at the back of that cavity into two branches, temporal and malar. The temforal branch runs in a groove along the outer wall of the orbit (in the malar bone), receives a branch of communication from the lachrymal, and, passing through a foramen in the malar bone, enters the temporal fossa. It ascends between the bone and substance of tho Temporal muscle, pierces this muscle and the temporal fascia about an inch above the zygoma, and is distributed to theSUPBBIOB MAXILLAEY. 511 integament covering fto temple and rido ot the forehead 00 n-ating with the (acia, and au,.io,.lo-tempo,.al branch ot orWt, emerge.

Senxnry Root Mo-tor Jiurscm The posterior hranck passes from behind forwards in the substance of the superior maxillary bone, and joins opposite the canine fossa with the anterior dental. Numerous filaments are given off from the lower border of this nerve, which form a minute plexus in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone, immediately above the alveoli. From this plexus filaments are distributed to the pulps of the molar and second bicuspid teeth, the lining membrane of the antrum, and corresponding portion of the gums. The anterior branch ia distributed to the gums and Buccinator muscle. The anterior denial, of large size, is given off" from the superior maxillary nerve just before its exit from the infraorbital foramen ; it enters a special canal in the anterior wall of the antrum, and anastomoses with the posterior dental. From this nerve some filaments are distributed to the incisor, canine, and firstCRANIAL NERVES. bicuspid tcctli; others are lost upon tho lining membrane covering the fore part of the inferior meatus. Tho 'jial'j)ch-al branches pass upwards beneath the Orbicularis palpebrarum. They supply this muscle, tho integument, and conjunctiva of the lower eyelid with sensation, joining at the outer angle of the orbit with tho facial nerve and malar branch of the orbital. The nasal branches pass inwards ; they supply the muscles and integument of the side of tho nose, and join with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The labial branches, the largest and most numerous, descend beneath the Levator labii superioris, and are distributed to the integument and muscles of the upper lip, the mucous membrane of the mouth, and labial glands. All these branches are joined, immediately beneath the orbit, by filaments from the facial nerve, forming an intricate plexus, the infraorbital. Spheno-Palatine Ganglion. The spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel's) (fig. 278), the largest of the cranial ganglia, is deeply placed in the spheno-maxillary fossa, close to the spheno- palatine foramen. It is triangular, or heart-shaped in form, of a reddish-grey colour, and placed mainly behind the palatine branches of the superior maxillary nerve, at the point where the sympathetic root joins the gangUon. It consequently does not involve those nerves which pass to the palate and nose. Like the other ganglia of the fifth nerve, it possesses a motor, a sensory, and a sympathetic root. Its motor root is derived from the facial, through the Vidian; its sensory root from the fifth; and its sympathetic root from the carotid plexus, through the Vidian. Its branches are divisible into four groups : ascending, which pass to the orbit; descending, to the palate ; internal, to the nose ; and posterior branches, to the pharynx. The ascending branches are two or three delicate filaments, which enter the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and supply the periosteum. Arnold describes and delineates these branches as ascending to the optic nerve; one, to the sixth nerve (Bock) ; and one, to the ophthalmic ganglion (Tiedemann). The descending or palatine branches are distributed to the roof of the mouth, the soft palate, tonsil, and lining membrane of the nose. They are almost a direct continuation of the spheno-palatine branches of the superior maxillary nerve, and are three in number : anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior, or large palatine nerve, descends through, the posterior palatine canal, emerges upon the hard palate, at the posterior palatine foramen, and passes forwards through a groove in the hard palate, nearly as far as the incisor teeth. It supplies the gums, the mucous membrane and glands of the hard palate, and communicates in front with the termination of the naso-palatine nerve. WMle in th,e posterior palatine canal, it gives ofi" infeiior nasal branches, which, enter the nose through openings in the palate bone, and ramify over the middle meatus, and the middle and inferior spongy bones ; and at its exit from the canal, a palatine branch is distributed to both surfaces of the soft palate. The middle, or external palatine nerve, descends in the same canal as the pre- ceding, to the posterior palatine foramen, distributing branches to the uvula, tonsil, and soft palate. It is occasionally wanting. The posterior, or small palatine nerve, descends with a small artery through the small posterior palatine canal, emerging by a separate opening behind the posterior palatine foramen. It supplies the Levator palati and azygos uvulsa muscles, the soft palate, tonsil and uvula. The internal branches are distributed to the septum, and outer wall of the nasal foss£B. They are the superior nasal (anterior), and the naso-palatine. The superior nasal branches (anterior), four or five in number, enter the back part of the nasal fossa by the spheno-palatine foramen. They supply the mucous membrane covering the superior and middle spongy bones, and that lining tlie513 SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. postenor ethmoidal cells, a few being prolonged to the upper and back part of the septum. , „ -i 1 .1 i 1 1 The naso-palatine nerve (Cotunnius) outers the nasal fos.sa wi h the other nasal nerves, and passes inwards across the roof of the nose, belovv the onface of the sphenoidal sinus, to reach the septum ; it then runs obliqaely downwards and for- wards along the lower part of the septum, to the anterior palatine foramen, lymg between the periosteum and mucous membrane. It descends to the roof of the mouth bj a distinct caual, which opens below in the anterior palatme fossa ; the right nerve, also in a separate canal, being posterior to the left one. In the mouth, thej become united, supply the mucous membrane behind the mcisor teeth, and join with the anterior palatine nerve. The naso-palatine nerve occasionally fur- nishes a few small filaments to the mucous membrane of the septum. 278.—The Spheno-Palatine Ganglion and its Branches. The posterior branches are the Vidian and pharyngeal (pterygo-palatine). Tbe Vidian nerve, if traced from Meckel's ganglion, may be said to arise from the back part of the spheno-palatine ganglion, and then passes through the Vidian canal, enters the cartilage filling in the foramen lacerum basis cranii, and divides into two branches, the large petrosal, and the carotid. In its course along the Vidian canal, it distributes a few filaments to the lining membrane at the back part of the roof of the nose and septum, and that covering the end of the Eustachian tube. These are upper posterior nasal branches. The large petrosal branch (nervuspetros^bs superfioialis major) enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum basis cranii, having pierced the cartilaginous sub- stance which fills in this aperture. It runs beneath the Casscrian ganglion and dura mater contained in a groove in the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, enters the hiatus Fallopii, and, being continued through it into the aquaxluctus Pallopii, joins the gangliform enlargement on tho facial nerve. Properly speaking, this nerve passes from the facial to the spheno-palatino ganglion, forming its motor root. The carotid branch is shorter, but larger than tbe petrosal, of a reddish-grey L L514 CRANIAL NKRVES. colour and soft in texture. It crosses tlio foramen lacorum surrounded by the cartilaginous Kubstanco which fills in that aperture, and enters the carotid canal on the outer side of the carotid artery, to join the carotid plexus. This description of the Vidian nerve as a branch from, the ganglion, is the more convenient anatomically, inasmuch as the nerve is generally dissected from the ganglion, as a single trunk dividing into two branches; But it is moi'c correct, physiologically, to describe the Vidian as being formed by the union of the two branches (great petrosal and carotid) from the facial and the sympathetic, and as runnino- into the ganglion. The filaments, which are described above as given off fi'om the Vidian nerve, would then be regarded as branches from the ganglion which arc merely enclosed in the same sheath, as the Vidian. The pharyngeal nerve (pterygo-jjalatine) is a small branch arising from the back part of the ganglion, occasionally together with tbe Vidian nerve. It passes through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pterygo-palatine artery, and is dis- tributed to tlie lining membrane of the pharynx, behind the Eustachian tube. Inferior Maxillary Nerve. (Fig. 277.) The Inferior Maxillary Nerve distributes branches to the teeth and gums of the lower jaw, the integument of the temple and external ear, the lower part of the face and lower lip, and the muscles of mastication: it also supplies the tongue with one of its special nerves of the sense of taste. It is the largest of the three divisions of the fifth,, and consists of two portions, the large or sensory root proceeding from the inferior angle of the Casserian ganglion ; and the small or motor root, which passes beneath the ganglion, and unites with the inferior maxillary nerve, just after its exit through the foramen ovale. Immediately beneath the base of the skull, this nerve divides into two trunks, anterior and posterior. The anterior, and smaller division, which receives nearly the whole of the motor root, divides into branches, which supply the muscles of mastication. They are the masseteric, deep temporal, buccal,* and two pterygoid. The masseteric Iranch passes outwards, above the External pterygoid muscle, in front of the temporo-maxillary articulation, and crosses the sigmoid notch, with the masseteric artery, to the Masseter muscle, in which it ramifies neaidy as far as its anterior border. It occasionally gives a branch to the Temporal muscle, and a filament to the articulation of the jaw. The deep temporal hranches, two in number, anterior and posterior, supply the deep surface of the Temporal mubcle. The 'posterior branch, of small size, is placed at the back of the lemporal fossa. It is sometimes joined with the masseteric branch. The anterior hranch is reflected upwards, at the pterygoid ridge of the sphenoid, to the front of the temporal fossa. It is occasionally joined with the buccal nerve. The hucca\branch pierces the External pterygoid, and passes downwards beneath the inner surfe,ce of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, or through the fibres of the Temporal muscle to reach the surface of the Buccinator, upon which it divides into a superior and an inferior branch. It gives a branch to the External ptery- goid during its passage through that muscle, and a few ascending filaments to the Temporal muscle, one of which occasionally joins with the anterior branch of the deep temporal nerve. The upper hranch supphes the integument and upper part of the Buccina,tor muscle, joining with the facial nerve round the facial vein. The lotver hranch passes forwards to the angle of the mouth ; it supplies the integument and Buccinator muscle, as well as the mucous membrane lining the inner surface of that muscle, and joins the facial nerve. The pterygoid branches are two in number, one for each pterygoid muscle. The Iranch to the Internal pterygoid is long and slender, and passes inwards to enter * It is doubtful whether the buccal branch conveys only sensory power to the buccinator, or motor influence likewise..GUSTATORY. 515 the deep surface of the muscle. This nerve is intimately conuected at its origin with the otic ganglion. The branch to the .External pterygoid is most frequently derived fi-om the buccal, but it may be given off separately from the anterior trunk of the nerve. .,, , The posterior and lai-ger division of the inferior maxillary nerve also receives a few filaments from the motor root. It divides into three branches : aunculo- temporal, gustatory, and inferior dental. The AuRicuLO-TEMPOiUL Nerve generally arises by two roots, betweeii which the middle meningeal artery passes. It runs backwards beneath the External pteiygoid muscle to the inner side of the articulation of the lower jaw. It then turns upwards with the temporal artery, between the external ear and condyle of the jaw, under cover of the parotid gland, and escaping from beneath this struc- ture, divides into two temporal branches. The posterior temporal, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the upper part of the pinna and the neighbouring tissues. The anterior temporal accompanies the temporal artery to the vertex of the skull, and supplies the integument of the temporal region, communicating with the facial nerve. The auriculo-temporal nerve has hranches of communication with, the facial and otic ganglion. Those joining the facial nerve, usually two in number, pass forwards behind the neck of the condyle of the jaw, and join this nerve at the posterior border of the Masseter muscle. They form one of the principal branches of communication between the facial and the fifth nerve. The filaments of com- munication with the otic ganglion are derived from the commencement of the auriculo-temporal nerve. The auricular hranches are two in number, inferior and superior. The inferior atiricular arises behind the articulation of the jaw, and is distributed to the ear below the external meatus; other filaments twine round the internal maxillary artery, and communicate with the sympathetic. The superior auricular arises in front of the external ear, and supplies the integument covering tlie tragus and pinna. Branches to the meatus auditorius, two in number, arise from the point of com- mnnication between the auriculo-temporal and facial nerves, and are distributed to the meatus. The branch to the temporo-maxillarij articulation is usually derived from the auriculo-temporal nerve. The parotid' branches supply the parotid gland. The Gustatory or Lingual Nerve, one of the special nerves of the sense of taste, supplies the papillaa and mucous membrane of the tongue. It is deeply placed throughout the whole of its course. It lies at first beneath the External pterygoid muscle, together with the inferior dental nerve, being placed to the inner side of the latter nerve, and is occasionally joined to it by a branch which crosses the internal maxillary artery. The chorda tympani also joins it at an acute angle in this situation. The nerve then passes between the Internal pterygoid muscle and the inner side of the ramus of the jaw, and crosses obliquely to the side of the tongue over the Superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, and beneath the Stylo-glossus muscle and deep part of the submaxillary gland; the nerve lastly runs across Wharton's duct, and along the side of the tongue to its apex, being covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth. Its branches- of communication are with the submaxillary ganglion and hypo- glossal nerve. The branches to the submaxillary ganglion are two or thi-ee in number; those connected with the hypoglossal nerve form a plexus at the anterioi- margin of the Hyo-glossns muscle. Its branches of distribution are few in number. Thev supply the mucous mem- brane of the mouth, the gums, the sublingual gland, the conical and fungiform papilla? and mucous membrane of the tongue, the terminal filaments anastomosing at the tip of the tongue with the hypoglossal nerve. The Inferior Dental is the largest of the three branches of the inferior L L 2CRANIAL NERVES. maxillary nerve. It passes downwards with tlio inferior dental artery* at first boneatli the External pterygoid ninscle, and then between the internal lateral ligament and the ramus of the jaw to the dental foramen. It then passes forwards in the dental caual in the inferior maxillary bone, lying beneath the teeth, as far as the mental foramen, whore it divides into two terminal branches, incisor and mental. The incisor hranch is continued onwards within the bone to the middle line, and supplies the canino and incisor teeth. The mental hranch emerges from the bono at the mental foramen, and divides beneath the Depressor anguli oris into an external branch, which su{)pHes that muscle, the Orbicularis oris, and the integument, communicating with tho facial nerve ; and an inner branch, which ascends to the lower lip beneath the Quadratus menti; it supplies that muscle and the mucous membrane and integument of the lip, communicating with the facial nerve. Tho bi-anches of the inferior dental are, the mylo-hyoid, and dental. The mylo-hyoid is derived from the inferior dental just as that nerve is about to enter the dental foramen. It descends in a groove on the inner surface of the ramus of the jaw, in which it is retained by a process of fibrous membrane. It supplies the cutaneous surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, and the anterior belly of the Digastric, occasionally sending one or two filaments to the submaxillary gland. The dental branches supply the molar and bicuspid teeth. They correspond in number to the fangs of those teeth : each nerve entering the orifice at the point of the fang, and supplying the pulp of the tooth. Two small ganglia ai-e connected with the inferior maxillary nerve : the otic, with the trunk of the nerve; and the sub-maxillary with its lingaal branch, the gustatory. Oxic Ganglion. The otic ganglion (Arnold's) (fig. 279) is a small, oval-shaped, flattened ganglion of a reddish-grey colour, situated immediately below the foramen ovale, on the 279.—The Otic Ganglion and its Branches. inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, and round the origin of the interna) ^"t rvffoid nerve.

The suhnaxillary ganglion (Bg. 277) is of small size, circular in form and situated above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, near the posterior border of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, being connected by filaments with the lower border of the gustatory nerve. _ , 4. ^ Branches of comvmnication. This ganglion is connected with the gustatory nerve by a few filaments which join it separately, at its fore and back part. It also receives a branch from the chorda tympani, by which it communicates with the facial; and communicates with the sympathetic by filaments from the nervi jnolles—the sympathetic plexus around the facial artery. Branches of distribution. These are five or six in number ; they arise from the lower part of the ganglion, and supply the mucous membrane of the mouth and Wharton's duct, some being lost in the submaxillary gland. According to Meckel, a branch from this ganglion occasionally descends in front of the Hyo-glossus muscle, and, after joining with one from the hypoglossal, passes to the Genio-hyo- glossus muscle. Eighth Pair. The eighth pair consists of three nerves, tbe glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory. The Glosso-Phartngeal Nerve is distributed, as its name implies, to the tongue and pharynx, being the nerve of sensation to the mucous membrane of the pharynx, fauces, and tonsil; of motion to the Pharyngeal muscles; and a special nerve of taste in all the parts of the tongue to which it is distributed. It is the smallest of the three divisions of the eighth pair, and arises by three or four filaments, closely connected together, from the upper part of the medulla oblongata, immediately behind the olivary body. Its cZeep origin may be traced through the fasciculi of the lateral tract, to a lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle — Prom its superficial origin, it passes outwards across the flocculus, and leaves the skull at the central part of thejugular foramen, in a separate sheath of the dura mater and arachnoid, in front of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves. In its passage through the jugular foramen, it grooves the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal hone ; and, at its exit from the skull, passes forwards between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and descends in front of the latter vessel, and beneath the styloid process and tbe 280.—Nerves of the Eighth Pair, their Origin, Ganglia, and Communications.

It then passes beneath the Hyo- glossus, and is finally dis- tributed to the mucous membrane of the fauces, . and base of the tongue, the mucous glands of the mouth and tonsil. In passing through the jugular foramen, the nerve presents, in succession, two gangliform enlargements. The superior, the smaller, is called the jugiilai- gang- lion, the inferior and larger the petrous ganglion, or the ganglion of Andersch. The superior, or jugu- lar ganglion, is situated in the upper part of the groove in -which the nerve is lodged during its pas- sage through the jugular foiamen. It is of Tery small size, and involves only the outer side of the trunk of the nerve, a small fasciculus passing beyond it, which is not connected directly with it. The inferior, or petrous ganglion, is situated in a depression in the lower border of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone ; it is larger than the for- . mer, and involves the whole of the fibres of the nerve. Erom this ganglion arise those filaments which con- nect the glosso-pharyngeal with other nerves at the base of the skull. Its branches of communis cation are with the pneu- mogastric, sympathetic, and facial, and the tym- panic branch. . . .

The Spinal Accessory Nerve consists of two parts: one, the accessory part to the vagus, and the other the spinal portion. , v x ci t- The accessory part, the smaller of the two, arises by four or five dehcate h aments from the lateral tract of the cord below the roots of the vagus ; these filaments may be traced to a nucleus of grey matter at the back of the medulla, below the origin of the vagus. It joins, in the "jugular foramen, with the upper ganglion ot the° vagus by one or two filaments, and is continued into the vagus below the •second ganglion. It gives branches to the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the vagus. The spinal portion, firm in texture, arises by several filaments from the lateral tract of the cord, as low down as the sixth cervical nerve; the fibres pierce the tract, and are connected with the anterior horn of the grey matter of the cord. This portion of the nerve ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, enters the skull through the foramen inagnum, and it is then directed outwards to the jugular foramen, through which it passes, lying in the same sheath as the pneumogastric, separated from it by a fold of the arachnoid, and is here connected with the accessory portion. At its exit from the jugular foramen, it passes backwards behind the internal jugular vein, and descends 'obliquely behind the Digastric and Stylo-liyoid muscles 'to the upper part of the5-° CRANIAL NERVES. Stcrno-mastoid. It piovces that nuiscle, and passes obliquely across the sub occipital triangle, to terminate in the deep surface of the Tmpezius. This nervo gives several branches to the Stcrno-mastoid during its passage through it and joins m Its substance with branches from the tliird cervical. In the .suboccipital triangle it joins with i,ho second and third cervical nerves, and assists in the for nriation of the cervical plexus, and occasionally of the gi^eat auricular nerve On the front of the Trapezius, it is reinforced by branches from the third fourth and fifth cervical nerves, joins with tHe posterior branches of tho spinal nerves and is distributed to tho Trapezius, somo filaments ascending and others descending in the substance of the muscle as far as its inferior angle. The Pneumoqasteio Ne-uve (nervus vagus, or pwi- vacjum), one of the three divisions of the eighth pair, has a more extensive distribution than any of the other oramal nerves, passing through the neck and thorax to tho upper part of the abdomen. It is composed of both motor and sensitive filaments. It supplies the organs of voice and respiration Avith motor and sensitive fibres; and the pharynx oesophagus, stomach, and heart with motor influence. Its superficial origm is by eight or ten filaments from the lateral tract immediately behind the olivary body and below the glosso-pharyngeal; its fibres may, liowever, be traced deeply througli the fasciculi of the medulla, to terminate in a grey nucleus near the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The filaments become united, and form a flat cord, whicli passes outwards across the flocculus to the jugular foramen, througli which it emerges from the cranium. In passing through" this opening, the pneumogastric accompanies the spinal accessory, being contained in the same sheath of dura mater with it, a membranous septum separating it from the glosso-pharyngeal, which lies in front. The nerve in this situation presents a well-marked ganglionic enlargement, which is called ganglion jttgulare, or the ganglion of the root of the pneumogastric : to it the accessory part of the spinal accessory nerve is connected. After the exit of the nerve from the jugular foramen, a second gangliform swelling is formed upon it, called the ganglion inferius, or the ganglion of the trunk of the nerve ; below which it is again joined by filaments from the accessorij nerve. The nerve passes vertically down the neck within the sheath of the carotid vessels, lying between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein as far as the thyroid cartilage, and then between the same vein and the common carotid to the root of the neck. Here the course of the nerve becomes different on the two sides of the body. On the rigid side, the nerve passes across the subclavian artery between it and the subclavian vein, and descends by the side of the trachea to the back part of the root of the lung, where it spreads out in a plexiform network (posterior pulmonary), from the lower part of which two cords descend upon the oesophagus, on which they divide, forming, with branches from the opposite nerve, the oesophageal plexus ; below, these branches are collected into a single cord, which runs along the back part of the oesophagus, enters the abdomen, and is distributed to the posterior surface of the stomach, joining the left side of the coeliac plexus, and the splenic plexus. On the left side, the pneumogastric nerve enters the chest between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, behind the left innominate vein. It crosses the arch of the aorta, and descends behind the root of the left lung and along the anterior surface of the oesophagus to the stomach, distributing branches over its anterior surface, some extending over the great cul-de-sac, and others along the lesser curvature. Filaments from these latter branches enter the gastro-hepatic omentum, and join the left hepatic plexus. The ganglion of the root is of a greyish colour, circular in form, about two lines in diameter, and resembles the ganglion on the large root of the fifth nerve. Connecting branches. To this ganglion tho accessory portion of the spinal accessory nerve is connected by several delicate filaments; it also has an anasto-PNEUMOGASTEIC. 521 motic twig with the petrous ganglion of the glosBO-phaiyi.gml, with the facial nerve by means of the auricular l^ranch, and with the sympathetic by means of an ascend- in^ filament from the superior cervical ganglion. . „ The gcnciUon of the tranlc (inferior) is a plexiforn. cord, cylindrical m form of a reddish colom-, and about an inch in length ; it involves he who e of the fibres of the nerve, except the portion of the nerve derived from the spinal accessory, which blends w^ith the nerve beyond the ganglion. i 1 wi Caimecting hranches. This ganglion is connected with the hypoglossal the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and the loop between the farst and second cervical nerves.

The auricular IranrJi (Arnold's) arises from the ganglion of the root, and is joined soon after its origin by a filament from the glosso-pharyngeal; it crosses the jugular fossa to an opening near the root of the styloid process. Traversing the substance of the temporal bone, it crosses the aquaeductus Pallopii about two lines above its termination at the stylo-mastoid foramen ; it here gives off an ascending branch, which joins the facial, and a descending branch, which anasto- moses with the posterior auricular branch of the same nerve : the continuation of the nerve reaches the surface between the mastoid process and the external audi- tory meatus, supplies the integument at the back part of the pinna, and communi- cates with the branches of the auriculai-is magnus. The pharyngeal branch, the principal motor nerve of the pharynx and soft palate, arises from the upper part of the inferior ganglion of the pneumogastric, receiving a filament from the accessory portion of the spinal accessory ; ib passes across the internal carotid artery (in front or behind), to the upper border of the Middle constrictor, where it divides into numerous filaments, which anastomose with those from the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, and sympathetic, to form the pharyngeal plexus, from which branches are distributed to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx. As this nerve crosses the internal carotid, some filaments are distributed, together with those from the glosso-pharyngeal, upon the wall of this vessel. The superior laryngeal is the nerve of sensation to the larynx. It is larger than the preceding, and arises from the middle of the inferior ganglion of the pneumo- gastric. It descends, by the side of the pharynx, behind the internal carotid, where it divides into two branches, the external and internal laryngeal. The external laryngeal branch, the smaller, descends by the side of the larynx, beneath the Sterno-thyroid, to supply the Crico-tliyroid muscle and the thyroid gland. It gives branches to the pharyngeal plexus, and the Inferior constrictor, and communicates with the superior cardiac nerve, behind the common carotid. The internal laryngeal branch descends to the opening in the thyi-o-hyoid mem* brane, through which it passes with the superior laryngeal artery, and is dis- tributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx, and the Arytenoid muscle, anastomosing with the recurrent laryno-eal. The branches to the mucous membrane are distributed, some in front, to the epiglottis, the base of the tongue and the epiglottidean glands ; while others pa.ssCRANIAL NERVES. 522 backwards, in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold, to supply tho mucous membrane sur- rounding the superior orifice of the larynx, as well as the membrane which lines the cavity of tlio larynx as low down as the vocal chord. Tlie tilamout to the Arytenoid muscle is distributed partly to it, and partly to the mucous lining of the larynx. The filament which joins with the recurrent laryngeal, descends beneath tho mucous membrane on the posterior surface of the larynx, behind the lateral part of the thyroid cartilage, whore the two nerves become united. The inferior or recurrent laryngeal, so called from its reflected course, is the motor nerve of tho larynx. It arises on the right side, in front of the subclavian artery : winds from before backwards round that vessel, and ascends obliquely to the side of the trachea, behind the common carotid and inferior thyroid arteries. On the left side, it arises in front of the arch of the aorta, and winds from before backwai-ds round the aorta at the point where the obliterated remains of the ductus arteriosus are connected with it, and then ascends to the side of the trachea. The nerves on both sides ascend in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, and, passing under the lower border of the Inferior constrictor muscle, enter the larynx behind the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage with the cricoid, being distributed to all the muscles of the larynx, excepting the Cinco-thyroid, and joining with the superior laryngeal. The recurrent laryngeal, as it winds round the subclavian artery and aorta, gives off several cardiac filaments, which unite with the cardiac branches from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. As it ascends in the neck, it gives off oesophageal branches, moi'e numerous on the left than on the right side, which supply the mucous membrane and muscular coat of the oesophagus ; tracheal branches to the mucous membrane and muscular fibres of the trachea; and some pharyngeal filaments to the Inferior constrictor of the pharynx. The cervical cardiac branches, two or three in number, arise from the pneumo- gastric, at the upper and lower part of the neck. The superior branches are small, and communicate with the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, and with the great cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac branches, one on each side, arise at the lower part of the neck, just above the first rib. On the right side, this branch passes in front of the arteria innominata, and anastomoses with the superior cardiac nerve. On the left side, it passes in front of tho arch of the aorta, and anastomoses either with the superior cardiac nerve, or with the cardiac plexus. The thoracic cardiac hranclies, on the right side, arise from the trunk of the pneumogastric, as it lies by the side of the trachea: passing inwards, they terminate in the deep cardiac plexus. On the left side they arise from the left recun-ent laryngeal nerve. The anterior pulmonary branches, two or three in number, and of small size, are distributed on the anterior aspect of the root of the lungs. They join vrith fila- ments from the sympathetic, and form the anterior pulmonary plexus. The posterior pulmonary branches, more numerous and larger than the anterior, are distributed on the posterior aspect of the root of the lung : they are joined by filaments from the third and fourth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and form the posterior pulmonary plexus. Branches from both plexuses accompany the ramifications of the air-tubes through the substance of the lungs. The oesophageal branches are given off from the pneumogastric both above and below the pulmonary branches. The lower are more numerous and larger than the upper. They form, together with branches from the opposite nerve, the oesophageal plexus. . The gastric branches are the terminal filaments of the pneumogastric nerve. The nerve on the right side is distributed to the posterior surface of the stomach, and ioins the left side of the cceliac plexus, and the splenic plexus. The nerve on the left side is distributed over the anterior surface of the stomach, some filaments passing across the great c^d-de-sac, and others along the lesser curva-523 ORIGINS OF CRANIAL NERVES. ture. They unite with branches of the right nerve and sympathetic, some fila- ments passing through the lesser omentum to the left hepatic plexus. For the following brief account of the most recent views relating to the origin of the cranial nerves, the editor is indebted to his friend Dr. Lockhart Clarke The third cerebral nerve arises chiefly from two large masses of grey substance at the floor of the iter 0 tortio ad quartum ventriculum beneath the corpora quadrigemina. . The fourth arises from two nuclei at the floor of iter e tertio ad quartum ventri- culum, and from the valve of Vieussens, where the opposite nerves decussate each other. The large root of the fifth or trigeminal arises chiefly from the grey tubercles of Rolando, or the upper expanded extremities of the posterior grey horns of the spinal cord ; the small or motor root arises from two masses of large multipolar cells situated each on the inner side, and close to the grey tubercle, and intimately connected with it. The sixth nerve arises in common with .the facial from the grey substance of tlie fasciculus teres on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The facial nerve has two origins :—i, From the grey substance of i\\e fasciculus teres on the floor of the fourth ventricle.—2. From the nucleus of the motor root of the trigeminus; between these two origins it forms a loop along the floor of the ventricle. The Auditory nerve has three origins:—i. From the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum; 2 and 3. From the inner and outer auditory nuclei formed chiefly by the grey substance of the posterior pyramid and restiform body. The vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves have each two origins:—i. From a special nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle. 2. From the anterior or motoi* part of the medulla. l:\ie8final-AccessoryTievYe has three origins:—i. The lower roots from the anterior grey horn of the spinal cord in common with the motor roots of the cervical nerves. 2. From the grey nuclens of the hypoglossal nerve. 3, From a special nucleus behind the central canal of the medulla oblongata. For further information on the origin of these nerves, and on the connection between their several nuclei, see Dr. Lockhart Clarke's memoir ' Oa the Intimate Structure of the Brain,' 1st and 2nd Ser. Phil. Trans. 1858 and 1868. For fuller detail concerning the Cranial Nerves, the student may refer to F. Arnolds ' Icones Nervorum Capitis,'The Spinal Nerves. THE spinal nerves are so called, because tbey take tbeir origin from tbe spinal cord, and are transmitted through the intervertebral foramina on either side of the spinal column. There ai^o thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, which are arranged into the following groups, corresponding to the region of tlie spine, through which they pass :— Cervical Dorsal Lumbar Sacral Coccygeal 8 pairs. 12 „ 5 • .> 5 >. It will be observed, that each group of nerves corresponds in number with the vertebrce in that region, except the cervical and coccygeal. Bacb spinal nerve arises by two roots, an anterior, or motor root, and a posterior, or sensory root. Roots of the Spinal Nerves. The anterior roots arise somewhat irregularly from a linear series of foramina, on the antero-lateral column of the spinal cord, gradually approaching towards tbe anterior median fissure as they descend. The fibres of the anterior roots, according to the researches of Dr. Lockhart Clarke, are attached to the anterior part of the antero-lateral column; and, after penetrating horizontally through the longitudinal fibres of this tract, enter the ^rey substance, where their fibrils cross each other and diverge m all directions, Hke the expanded hairs of a brush, some of them running more or less longi- tudinally upwards and downwards, and others decussating with those of the opposite side through the anterior commissure in front of the central canal K511iker states that many fibres of the anterior root enter the lateral column of the same side, where, turning upwards, they pursue their course as longitudinal fibres. In other respects, the description of tbe origin of the anterior roots by these observers is very similar. The posterior roots are all attached immediately to the posterior white columns only ■ but some of them pass through the grey substance into both the lateral and anterior white columns. Within the grey substance, they run, longitudinany, upwards and downwards, transversely, through the posterior commissure to the opposite side, and into the anterior column of their own side The posterior roots of the nerves are larger, but the individual filamente are finer and more delicate than those of the anterior. As their component fibrils pass outwards, towards the aperture in the dura mater, they coalesce into two bundles, receive a tubular sheath from that membrane, and enter the ganglion which is developed upon each root. Ti.e posterior root of the first cervical nerve forms an exception to these chiracters It is smaller than the anterior, has frequently no ganglion developed nnon it and when the ganglion exists, it is often situated within the dura mater. ' The ant; or roots are the smaller ;f the two, devoid of any ganglionic enlarge- ment their component fibrils are collected into two bundles, near the inter- vertebral foramina.CERVICAL. 525 Ganglia op thk Spinal Nerves. ■ 1 , ] +1,0 r„^Bfor1■nT• root of each of tlio spinal nerves.

Each ganglion is bifid internally, where it as joined by the ^unc es of the posterioi-root, the two portions being united into a single mass ex einallj . The o-angha upon the first and second cervical nerves form an exception to these cbaivacters, being placed on the arches of the vertebrae over which the nerves pass The ganglia, also, of the sacral nerves are placed within the spmal canal; and that on the coccygeal nerve, also in the canal about the middle of its posterior root. Immediately beyond the ganglion, the two roots coalesce, their fibres intermingle, and the trunk thus formed passes out of the intervertebral foramen, and divides into an anterior branch, for the supply of the anterior part of the body; and a posterior branch for the posterior part, each branch containing fibres from both roots. Anterior Branches of the Spinal Nerves. The anterior hranches of the spinal nerves supply the parts of the body in front of the spine, including the limbs. They are for the most part larger than the posterior branches; this increase of size being proportioned to the lai-ger extent of structures they are required to supply. Each branch is connected by slender filaments with the sympathetic. In the dorsal region, the anterior branches of the spinal nerves are completely separate from each other, and are uniform in their distribution; but in the cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions, they form intricate plexuses previous to their distribution. Posterior Branches of the Spinal Nerves. The posterior hranclies of the spinal nerves are generally smaller than the anterior : they arise from the trunk resulting from the union of the roots, in the interverte- bral foramina ; and, passing backwards, divide into external and internal branches, which are distributed to the muscles and integument behind the spine. The first cervical and lower sacral nerves are exceptions to these characters. Cervical Nerves. The roots of the cervical nerves increase in size from the first to the fifth, and then maintain the same size to the eighth. The posterior roots bear a jiroportion to the anterior as 3 to i, which is much greater than in any other region, the individual filaments being also much larger than those of the anterior roots. In direction, the roots of the cervical are less oblique than those of the other spinal nerves. The first cervical nerve is directed a little upwards and outwards ; the second is horizontal; the others are directed obliquel}^ downwards and outwards, the lowest being the most oblique, and consequently longer than the upper, the distance between their place of origin and their point of exit from the spinal canal never exceeding the depth of one vertebra. The trunk of the first cervical nerve {stiloccipitoT) leaves the spinal canal, between the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas ; the second between the posterior arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis; and the eighth (the last), between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrse. Bach nerve, at its exit from the intervertebral foramen, divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus. The anterior branches of the four lower cervical nerves, together with the first dorsalj form the brachial plexus.526 SPINAL NERVES. AnTEKIOB BllANCUES 01'' THE CerVXCAI; NeUVES. Tho anterior hranch of the Jird, or suhocoipital neftoe, is of small size. It Soscapes from the spinal canal, through a groove upon the posterior arch of the atlas. In this groove it lies beneath the vei-tobral artery, to the inner side of tho Rectus capitis lateralis. As it crosses the foramen in the transverse pi-ocess of the atlas, it receives a filament from the sympathetic. It then descends, in front of this process, to communicate with an ascending branch from the second cervical nerve. Communicating filaments from this nerve join the pneumogastric, the hypo- glossal and sympathetic, and some branches are distributed to the Rectus lateralis, and the two Anterior recti. According to Valentin, the anterior branch of the suboccipital also distributes filaments to the occipito-atloid articulation, and mastoid process of the temporal bone. The anterior branch of the second cervical nerve escapes from the spinal canal^ between the posterior arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis, and, passing forwards on the outer side of the vertebral artery, divides in front of the Inter- transverse muscle, into an ascending branch, which joins the first cervical; and two descending branches which join the third. The anterior branch of the third cervical nerve is double the size of the preceding. At its exit from the intervertebral foramen, it passes dowuAvards and outwards beneath the Sterno-mastoid, and divides into two branches. The ascending branch joins the anterior division of the second cervical, communicates with the sympa- thetic and spinal accessory nerves, and subdivides into the superficial cervical and great auricular nerves. The descending branch passes down in front of the Scalenus anticus, anastomoses with the fourth cervical nerve, and becomes continuous with the clavicular nerves. The anterior branch of the fourth cervical is of the same size as the preceding. It receives a branch from the third, sends a communicating brancb to the fifth cervical, and passing downwards and outwards, divides into numerous filaments, which cross the posterior triangle of the neck, towards the clavicle and acromion. It usually gives a branch to the pbrenic nerve, whilst it is contained in the inter- transverse space. The anterior branches of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves are remarkable for their large size. They are mucli larger than the preceding nerves, and are all of equal size. They assist in the formation of the brachial plexus. Cervical Plexus. The cervical plexus (fig. 276) is foi-med by the anterior branches of the fom* upper cervical nerves. It is situated opposite the four upper vertebrae, resting upon tbe Levator anguli scapula9, and Scalenus medius muscles, and covered in by the Sterno-mastoid. Its branches may be divided into two groups, superficial and deep, which may be thus arranged:— S'itperfi( Deep Superficialis colli. Auricularis magnus. OccipitaHs minor. [ Sternal. Descending.

SupicuFiciAL Branches of the Cervical Plexus. The Superficial^ Colli arises from the second and third cervical nerves, tarns round the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid about its middle and passing obliquely forwards beneath the external jugular vein to the anterior border of that muscle, perforates the deep cervical fascia, and divides benea h the Pktysma into two branches, which are distributed to the anterior and lateral parts ot the neck. The ascending hranch gives a filament, which accompanies the external jugular vein; it then passes upwards to the submaxillary region, and divides into branches, some of which form a plexus with the cervical branches of the facial nerve beneath the Platysma ; others pierce that muscle, supply it, and are distri- buted to the integument of the upper half of the neck, at its fore part, as high as the chin. The descending hranch pierces the Platysma, and is distributed to the integument of the side and front of the neck, as low as the sternum. This nerve is occasionally represented by two or more filaments. The Jhiricularis Magnus is the largest of the ascending branches. It arises from the second and third cervical nerves, winds round the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, and after perforating the deep fascia, ascends upon that muEcle beneath the Platysma to the parotid gland, where it divides into numerous branches. The facial hranches pass across the parotid, and are distributed to the integu- ment of the face ; others penetrate the substance of the gland, and communicate with the facial nerve. The posterior or auricular branches ascend vertically to supply the integument of the back part of the pinna, communicating with the auricular branches of the facial and pnenmogastric nerves. The mastoid hranch joins the posterior auricular branch of the facial, and crossing the mastoid process, is distributed to the integument behind the ear. The Occipitalis Minor arises from the second cervical nerve; it curves round the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid above the preceding, and ascends verti- cally along the posterior border of that muscle to the back jsart of the side of the head. Near the cranium it perforates the deep fascia, and is continued upwards along the side of the head behind the ear, supplying the integ'ument and Occipito- frontalis muscle, and communicating with the occipitalis major, auricularis magnus, and posterior auricular branch of the facial. This nerve gives off an auricular hranch, which supplies the Attollens aui'em and the integument of the upper and back part of the auricle. This branch is occasionally derived from the great occipital nerve. The occipitalis minor varies in size; it is occasionally double. The Descending or supra-clavicular hranches arise from the third and foui-th cervical nerves ; emerging beneath the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, they descend in the interval between that muscle and the Trapezius, and divide into branches, which are arranged, according to their position, into three groups. The inner or sternal hranch crosses obUquely over the clavicular and sternal attachments of the Sterno-mastoid, and supplies the integument as far as the median line. The middle or clavicular hranch crosses the clavicle, and supplies the integu- ment over the Pectoral and Deltoid muscles, communicating with the cutaneous branches of the upper intercostal nerves. Not unfrequently^ the clavicular branch passes through a foramen in the clavicle, at the junction of the outer with the middle third of the bone. The external or aaromdal hranch passes obliquely across the outer surface of the Trapezius and the acromion, and supplies the integument of the upper and back part of the shoulder.SPINAL NERVES. 5^8 Deep Branches of the Cervical Plexus. Internal Series. The cunmvmiicatvrui hmnohes consist of several filaments, which pass from the loop between the first and second cervical nerves in front of the atlas to the pnenniogastric, hypoglossal, sympathetic, and fifth cervical. Muticular hranchcs supply the Anterior recti and Rectus lateralis muscles ; they proceed from the first cervical nerve, and from the loop formed between it and tlie second. Tlio Gommunioans Nonl (lig. 276) consists usually of two filaments, one being derived from the second, and the other from the third cervical. The.se filaments pass voi'tically downwards on the outer side of the internal jugular vein, cross in front of the vein a little below the middle of the neck, and form a loop with the desccndens noni in front of the sheath of the carotid vessels. Occasionall}^ the junction of these nerves takes place within the sheath. The Phrenic Nerve (interiMl res'piratorij of Bell) arises from the third and fourth ' cervical nerves, and receives a communicating branch from the fifth. It descends to the root of the neck, lying obliquely across the front of the Scalenus anticus, passes over the first part of the subclavian artery, between it and the subclavian vein, and, as it enters the chest, crosses the internal mammary artery near its root. Within the chest, it descends nearly vertically in front of the root of the lung, and by the side of the pericardium, between it and the mediastinal portion of the pleura, to the Diaphragm, where it divides into branches, which separately pierce that muscle, and are distributed to its under surface. The two phrenic nerves dilfer in their length, and also in their relations at the upper part of the thorax. The right nerve is situated more deeply, and is shorter and more vertical in direction than the left-; it lies on the outer side of the right vena innominata and superior vena cava. The left nerve is rather longer than the right, from the inclination of the heart to the left side, and from the Diaphragm being lower on this than on the opposite side. At the upper part of the thorax, it crosses in front of the arch of the aorta to the root of the lung. Each nerve supplies filaments to the pericardium and pleura, and near the chest is joined by a filament from the sympathetic, by another deiived by the fifth and sixth cervical nerves, and occasionally, by one from the union of the descendens noni with the spinal nerves : this filament is found, according to Swan, only on the left side. It is also usually connected by a filament with the nerve to the sub- clavius muscle. From the right nerve, one or two filaments pass to join in a smaU ganglion ■with phrenic branches of the solar plexus ; and branches from this ganglion arc distributed to the hepatic plexus, the suprarenal capsule, and inferior vena cava. From the left nerve, filaments pass to join the phrenic plexus, but without any ganglionic enlargement. Deep Branches of the Cervical Plexus. External Series. Communicating branches. The cervical plexus communicates with the spinal accessory nerve, in the substance of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, in the occipital ti-iangle, and beneath the Trapezius. Muscular branches are distributed to the Sterno-mastoid, Levator anguli scapula;, Scalenus medius and Trapezius. • , ,1 The branch for the Sterno-mastoid is derived from the second cervical, tlie Levator anguli scapute receiving branches from ihe third, and the Trapezius branches fi'om the third and fourth. Posterior Branches ok tub Cervical Nerves. The posterior branches of the cervical nerves, with the exception of those of the Srst two, pass backwards, and divide, behind the posterior Intertransverse muscles, mto external and internal branches.BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 529 Tie ext&mal Iranches snpply the muscles at the side of the neck, viz., the Cervicalis ascendens, Transvorsalis colli, and Trachelo-mastoid. _ The external branch of the second cervical nerve is the largest; it is often joined with the third, and supplies the Complexus, Splenius, and Trachelo-mastoid muscles The internal branches, the larger, are distributed differently m the upper and lower part of the neck. Those derived from the third, foui-th, and fifth nerves pass between the Semispinalis and Complexus muscles, and having reached the spinous processes, perforate the aponeurosis of the Splenius and Trapezius, and are continued outwards to the integument over the Trapezius ; whilst those derived fi-om the three lowest cervical nerves are the smallest, and are placed beneath the Semispinalis, AvHch they supply, and do not furnish any cutaneous filaments. These internal branches supply the Complexus, SemispinaHs colli, Literspinales, and Multifidus spinje. The posterior branches of the first three cervical nerves require a separate description. The postenor branch of the first cervical nerve {suboccipital) is larger than the anterior, and escapes from the spinal canal between the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas, lying behind the vertebral artery. It enters the triangular space formed by the Rectus posticus major, the Obliquus superior, and Obliquus inferior, and supplies the Recti and Obliqui muscles, and the Complexus. From the branch which supplies the Inferior oblique a filament is given off, which joins the second cervical nerve. This nerve also occasionally gives off a cutaneous filament, which accompanies the occipital artery, and communicates with the occipitalis major and minor nerves. The posterior division of the first cervical has no branch analogous to the external branch of the posterior cervical nerves. The posterior branch of the second cervical nerve is three or four times greater than the anterior branch, and the largest of all the posterior cervical nerves. It emerges from the spinal canal between the posterior arch of the atlas and lamina of the axis, below the Inferior oblique. It supplies this muscle, and receives a com- municating filament from the first cervical. It then divides into an external and an internal branch. The internal branch, called, from its size and distribution, the occipitalis major, ascends obliquely iuwards between the Obliquus inferior and Complexus, and pierces the latter muscle and the Trapezius near their attachments to the cranium. It is now joined by a filament from the third cervical nerve, and ascending on the back part of the head with the occipital artery, divides into two branches, which supply the integument of the scalp as far forwards as the vertex, communicating with the occipitalis minor. It gives off an auricular branch to the back part of the ear, and muscular branches to the Complexus. The posterior branch of the third cervical is smaller than the preceding, but larger than the fourth ; it differs from the posterior branches of the other cervical nerves in its supplying an additional filament to the integument of the occiput. This occipital branch arises from the internal or cutaneous branch beneath the Trapezius; it pierces that muscle, and suppHes the skin on the lower and back part of the head. It Hes to the inner side of the occipitalis major, with which it is connected. The internal branches of the posterior divisions of the first three cervical nerves are occasionaUy joined beneath the Complexus by communicating branches. This communication is described by Cruveilhier as the posterior cervical plexus. The Brachial Plexus. (Fig. 282.) The brachial plexus is formed by the union of the anterior branches of the four lower cervical and first dorsal nerves. It extends from the lower part of the side of the neck to the axilla. It is very broad and presents little of a plexiform arrangement at its commencement, is narrow opposite the clavicle, becomes broad, M MPttscleulue from ' ififi Cerv.ir.

ANTERIOR THORACIC. The communicating Iranch with the phrenic is derived from the fifth cervical nerve ; it joins the phrenic on the Anterior scalenus muscle. The muscular branches supply the Longus colli, Scaleni, Rhomboidei, and Subclavius muscles. Those for the Scaleni and Longus colli arise from the lower cervical nerves at their exit from the intervertebral foramina. The rhomboid branch arises from the fifth cervical, pierces the Scalenus medius, and passes beneath the Levator anguli scapute, which it occasionally supphes, to the Rhom- boid muscles. The nerve to the Subclavius is a small filament, which arises from the trunk formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; it descends in front of the subclavian artery to the Subclavius muscle, and is usually connected by a filament with the phrenic nerve. The posterior thoracic nerve (long thoraic, external respiratory of Bell), (fig. 285), supplies the Serratus magus, and is remarkable for the length of its course. It ai'ises by two roots, from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves, immediately after their exit from the intervertebral foramina. These unite in the substance of the Middle scalenus muscle, and, after emerging from it, the nerve passes down behind the brachial plexus and the axillary vessels, resting on the outer surface of the Serratus magnus. It extends along the side of the chest to the lower border of that muscle, and supplies it with numerous filaments. The suprascapular nerve (fig. 286) arises from the cord formed by the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves; passing obliquely outwards beneath the Tra- pezius, it enters the supraspinous fossa, through the notch in the upper border of the scapula; and, passing beneath the Supraspinatus muscle, curves in front of the spine of the scapula to the infraspinous fossa. In the supraspinous fossa, it gives ofi'two branches to the Supraspinatus muscle, and an articular filament to the shoulder-joint; and in the infraspinous fossa, it gives off two branches to the Infraspinatus muscle, besides some filaments to the shoulder-joint and scapula.

The SuDSCAPULAU NiiHVES, tlireo in number, supply the Subscapularis, Teres major, and Latissinius dorsi muscles. The u'p'per mhscapular nerve, the smallest, enters the upper pai-t of the Sub- scapularis muscle. The loiver sulscapular nerve enters the axillary border of the Subscapularis, and terminates in the Teres major. The latter muscle is sometimes supplied by a separate branch. The long sichscajpidar, .the largest of the three, descends along the lower border of the Subscapularis to the Latissimus dorsi, through which it may be traced as far as its lower border. The Circumflex Neeve (fig. 286) sup- plies some of the muscles, and the inte- gument of the shoulder, and the shoulder- joint. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, in common with the musculo-spiral nerve. It passes down behind the axillary artery, and in front of the Subscapularis ; and, at the lower border of that muscle, passes backwards, and divides into two branches. The upper branch winds round the ' neck of the humerus, beneath the Deltoid, with the posterior circumflex vessels, as far as the anterior border of that muscle, supplying it, and giving off cutaneous branches, which pierce it to ramify in the integument covering its lower part. The loiver Iranch, at its origin, dis- tributes filaments to the Teres minor and back part of the Deltoid muscles. Upon the filament to the former muscle a gangliform enlargement usually exists. The nerve then pierces the deep fascia, and supplies the integument over the lower two-thirds of the posterior surface of the Deltoid, as well as that covering the long head of the Triceps. The circumflex nerve, before its divi- sion gives off an articular filament, which enters the shoulder-joint below the Sub- scapularis. The MuscuLO-CuTANEOUs Nerve (fig. 285) (external cutaneous, perforans Gas- serii), supplies some of the muscles of the arm, and the integument of the fore-arm. It arises from the outer cord of the brachial plexus, opposite the lower border of the Pectoralis minor. It then perforates the Coraco-brachialis muscle, and passes obliquely between the Biceps and Brachialis anticus, to the outer side of the arm, a little above the elbow, where it perforates the deep fascia and becomes cutaneous. This nerve, in its course through the arm, supplies the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, and Brachialis anticus muscles, besides sending some filaments to the elbow-jomt and humerus. Ill533. INTERNAL CUTANEOUS. 284.—Cutaneous Nerves of Eight Upper Extremity. Posterior View. The cutaneous portion of the nerve passes behind the median cephalic vem, and divides opposite the elbow-joint, into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch descends along the radial border of the fore-arm to the wrist. It is here placed in front of the radial artery, and, piercing the deep fascia, accompanies that vessel to the back of the wrist. It communicates with a branch from the radial nerve, and the palmar cutaneous branch of the median, and distributes filaments to the integu- ment of the ball of the thumb. The postenor branch is given off about the middle of the fore-arm, and passes downwards, along the back part of its radial side to the wrist. It supplies the integument of the lower third of the fore-arm, communicating with the radial nerve, and the external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve (fig. 285) is one of the smallest branches of the brachial plexus. It arises from the inner cord, in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and, at its commencement, is placed on the inner side of the brachial artery. It passes down the inner side of the arm, pierces the deep fascia with the basilic vein, about the middle of the limb, and, becoming cutaneous, divides into two branches. This nerve gives off, near the axilla, a cutaneous filament, which pierces the fascia, and supplies the integument cover- ing the Biceps muscle, nearly as far as the elbow. This filament lies a little ex- ternal to the common trunk, from which it arises. The anterior branch, the larger of the two, passes usually in front of, but occa- sionally behind, the median basihc vein. It then descends on the anterior surface of the ulnar side of the fore-arm, distri- buting filaments to the integument as far as the wrist, and communicating with a cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. The posterior branch passes obliquely downwards on the inner side of the basilic vein, winds over the internal condyle of the humerus to the back of the fore-arm, and descends, on the posterior surface of its ulnar side, to a little below the middle, distributing filaments to the integument. It anastomoses above the elbow, witli the lesser internal cutaneous, and above the wrist, with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve (Swan). / p-rrr-T v ,^ The LeSSER INTERNAL CuTANEOUS NeRVE (nerve af Wrisberg) (6g. 285), is distributed to the integnment on the inner side it IS the smallest of the branches of the brachial plexus, and usually of the arm.534 SPINAL NERVES. arises from the inner cord, with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves. It passes through the axillary space, at first lying behind, and then on the inner side of the axillary vein, and communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve. It then descends alon- the inner side of the braclnal artery, to the middle of the arm, where it pierces the deep fascia, and is distributed to tlie integument of the back part of the lower third of the arm, extending as far as the elbow, where some filaments are lost in the integuments in front of the inner condyle, and others over the ole- cranon It communicates with the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve. In some cases the nerve of Wrisborg and intercosto-humeral are connected W two or three filaments, which form a plexus at the back part of the axilla. In other cases, the intercosto-humeral is of large size, and takes the place of the nerve of Wrisberg, receiving merely a filament of communication from the brachial plexus, which represents the latter nerve. In other cases, this filament is wanting, the place of the nerve of Wrisberg being supplied entirely from the intercosto-humeral. The Median Nerve (fig. 285) has received its name from the course it takes along the middle of the arm and fore-arm to the hand, lying between the ulnar and the musculo-spiral and radial nerves. It arises by two roots, one from the outer, and one from the inner cord of the brachial plexus ; these embrace the lower part of the axillary artery, uniting either in front or on the outer side of that vessel. As it descends through the arm, it lies at first on the outer side of the brachial artery, crosses that vessel in the middle of its course, usually in front, but occasionally behind it, and lies on its inner side to the bend of the elbow, where it is placed heneath the bicipital fascia, and is separated from the elbow-jomt by the Brachialis anticus. In the fore-arm, it passes between the two heads ot the Pronator radii teres, and descends beneath the Flexor sublimis, to within two inches above the annular ligament, where it becomes more superficial, lying be- tween the Flexor subUmis and Flexor carpi radialis, beneath, or rather to the ulnar side of, the tendon of the Palmaris longus, covered by the integument and fascia. It then passes beneath the annular Hgament into the hand. _ Brandies. No branches are given ofi" from the median nerve in the arm.

The digital branches are five in number. The fird and second pass along the borders of the thumb, the external branch communicating with branches of the radial nerve. The third passes along the radial side of the index finger, and supplies the first Lumbricalis muscle. Tho fomth subdivides to supply the adjacent sides of the index and middle fingers, and sends a branch to the second Lumbricahs muscle. The fifth supplies the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers, and communicates with a branch from the ulnar nerve. Each dio-ital nerve, opposite the base of the first phalanx, gives off" a dorsal branch, which joins the dorsal digital nerve, and runs along the side of the dorsum of the finger, ending in the integument over the last phalanx. At the end of the finger, the digital nerve divides into a palmar and a dorsal branch; the former of which supplies the extremity of the finger, and the latter ramifies round and beneath the nail. The digital nerves, as they run along the fingers, are placed superficial to the digital arteries. The Ulnar Nerve (fig. 285) is placed along the inner or ulnar side of the upper limb, and is distributed to the muscles and integument of the fore-arm and hand. It is smaller than the median, behind which it is placed, diverging from it in its coui-se down the arm. It arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, in common with the inner head of the median and the internal cutaneous nerve. At its commencement, it lies at the inner side of the axiUary artery, and holds the same relation with the brachial artery to the middle of the arm. From this point, it runs obliquely across the internal head of the Triceps, pierces the internal intermuscular septum, and descends to the groove between the internal condyle and olecranon, accompanied by the inferior profunda artery. At the elbow, it rests upon the back of the inner condyle, and passes into the fore-arm between the two heads of the Plexor carpi ulnaris. In the fore-arm, it descends m a perfectly straight course along its ulnar side, lying upon the Flexor profundus dio-itorum, its upper half being covered by the Flexor carpi uhians its lower half lyTng on the outer side of the muscle, covered by the integument and fascia, ihe ulnar artery, in the upper third of its course, is separated from the uhiar nerve by a considerable interval; but in the rest of its extent, the nerve hes to its mner side At the wrist, the ulnar nerve crosses the annular ligament on the outer side of the pisiform bone, a little behind the ulnar artery, and immediately beyond this bone divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar.

Sujint-S'ra/jufar- The dorsal cutaneous branch arises about two inches above the wrist; it passes backwards beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, perforates the deep fascia and runnino- alons the ulnar side of the wrist and hand, supplies the inner side of the little fiLer, and the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers ; it also sends a communicating filament to that branch of the radial nerve which supplies the adjoining sides of the middle and ring fingers. The artMar filaments to the wnst are also supplied by the ulnar nerve. The supeificial palmar branch supplies the Palmaris brevis, and the integument on the inner side of the hand, and terminates in two digital branches, which are distributed, one to the ul- nar side of the little finger the other to the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers, the latter com- municating with a branch from the median. The deep palmar branch passes between the Abduc- tor and Flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles, and follows the course of the deep palmar arch beneath the flexor tendons. At its origin, it supplies the muscles of the little finger. As it crosses the deep part of the hand, it sends two branches to each interos- seous space, one for the Dorsal and one for the Palmar interosseous mus- cle, the branches to the second and third Palmar interossei supplying fila- ments to the two inner Lumbricales muscles. At its termination between the thumb and index finger, it supplies the Adductor pol- licis and the inner head of the Flexor brevis pollicis. The Musculo-Spiral Neeve (fig. 286), the larg- est branch of the brachial plexus, supplies the mus- cles of the back part of the arm and fore-arm, and the integument of the same parts, as well as that of the hand. It arises from the posterior cord of tho brachial plexus by a com- mon trunk with the cir- ^mflex nerve. At its commencement it is jjlaced yinxriilo-Siiiraf538 SPINAL Ni^iiVES. beliind the axillary and upper part of the brachial arteries, passing down in front of the tendons of the Latissimns dorsi and Teres major. It wmds round the humerus in the spiral gvoovo with the superior profunda artery, passing from the inner to the outer side of the bone, beneath the Triceps muscle. At the outer side of the arm, it descends between the Brachialis anticus and Supinator longus to the front of the external condyle, where it divides into the radial and posterior inter- osscons nerves. The branches of the musculo-spiral nerve are :— Muscular. Radial. Cutaneous. Posterior interosseous. The muscular hranches are divided into internal, posterior, and external; they supply the Triceps, Anconeus, Supinator longus, Extensor carpi radialis longior, and Brachialis anticus. These branches are derived from the nerve, at the inner side, back part, and outer side of the arm. The internal muscular branches supply the inner and middle heads of the Triceps muscle. That to the inner head of the Triceps, is a long, slender filament, which lies close to the uhiar nerve, as far as the lower third of the arm. The posterior muscular branch, of large size, arises from the nerve m the groove between the Triceps and the humerus. It divides into branches which supply the outer head of the Triceps and Anconeus muscles. The branch for the latter muscle is a long, slender filament, which descends in the substance of the Triceps to the Anconeus in the same course with the posterior articular branch from the superior profunda artery. The external, muscular branches supply the Supmator longus, Extensor carpi radialis longior, and, usually, the Brachiahs anticus. The cutaneous Iranches are three in number, one internal and two external. The internal cutaneous branch arises in the axillary space, with the inner muscular branch. It is of small size, and passes through the axilla to the inner side of the arm, supplying the integument on its posterior aspect nearly as far as ^^^Thetwrexternal cutaneous branches perforate the outer head of the Triceps, at its attachment to the humerus. The upper and smaller one f oUows the course of the cephalic vein to the front of the elbow, supplymg the mtegument of the lower half of the upper arm on its anterior aspect. The lower branch pierces the deep fascia below the insertion of the Deltoid, a,nd passes down ^lo-g side of the arm and elbow, and along the back pai4) of the radial side of the fore-ann to the wrist, supplying the integument in its course, and jommg, neai- its termination, with a branch of the external cutaneous nerve. ™e raiaZ nerve passes along the front of the radial side of the fore-arm to the commencement of its lower thi.^d.

Considerably diminished in size, it descends on the interosseous membrane, beneath the Extensor secundi internodii poUicis, to the back of the carpus, where it presents a gangliform enlargement, from which filaments are dis- tributed to the ligaments and articulations of the carpus. It supplies all the muscles of the radial and posterior brachial regions, excepting the Anconeus, Supinator longus, and Extensor carpi radialis longior. Dorsal ITertes. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number on each side. The first appears between the first and second dorsal vertebrsB, and the last between the last dorsal and first lumbar. The roots of origin of the dorsal nerves are few in number, of small size, and vary but slightly from the second to the last. Both roots are very slender; the posterior roots only slightly exceeding the anterior in thickness. These roots gi-adually increase in length from above downwards, and remain in contact with the spinal cord for a distance equal to the height of, at least, two vertebras, in the lower part of the dorsal region. They then join in the intervertebral foramen, and, at their exit, divide into two branches, a posterior (dorsal), and an anterior, (intercostal) branch. The first and last dorsal nerves are peculiar in several respects (see next page). The posterior branches of the dorsal nerves, which are smaller than the intercostal, pass backwards between the transverse processes, and divide into external and internal branches. The external Iranches increase in size from above downwards. They pass through the Longissimus dorsi, corresponding to the celltilar interval between it and the Sacro-lumbalis, and supply those muscles, as well as their continuations upwards to the head, and the Levatores costarum; the five or six lower nerves also give ofi" cutaneous filaments. The internal Iranches of the six upper nerves pass inwards to the interval between the Multifidus spinse, and Semispinalis dorsi muscles, which they supply; and then, piercing the origin of the Rhomboidei and Trapezius, become cutaneous by the side of the spinous processes. The internal branches of the six lower nerves are distributed to the Multifidus spinas, without giving off any cutaneous filaments. ^ The cutcmeous branches of the dorsal nerves are twelve in number, the six upper being derived from the internal branches, and the six lower from the external branches. The former pierce the Rhomboid and Trapezius muscles, close to the spmous processes, and ramify in the integument. They are frequently furnished with gangliform enlargements. The six lower cutaneous branches pierce th& Serratus posticus inferior, and Latissinms dorsi, in a line with the angles of the ribs. ° Intercostal N'erves.

S40 TJprER Inteucostal Nerves. The upper intercostal nerves pass forwards in the intercostal spaces with the intercostal vessels, being situated below them. At the back of the chest they lie between the pleura and the External intercostal muscle, but are soon placed between the two planes of Intercostal muscles as far as the costal cartilages, where they lie between the pleura and the Internal intercostal muscles. Near the sterniim, they cross the internal mammary artery, and Triangularis sterni, pierce the Internal intercostal and Pectoralis major muscles, and supply the integument of the mamma and front of the chest, fonning the anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax ; the branch £i-om the second nerve becoming joined with the clavicular nerve. Branches. Numerous slender muscular filaments supply the Intercostal and Triangularis sterni muscles. Some of these branches, at the front of the chest, cross the costal cartilages from one to another intercostal space. Lateral cutaneous nerves. These are derived from the intercostal nerves, mid- way between the vertebrte and sternum ; they pierce the External intercostal and Serratus magnus muscles, and divide into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior Iranches are reflected forwards to the side and the fore part of the chest, supplying the integument of the chest and mamma, and the upper digita- tions of the External oblique. The posterior Iranches are reflected backwards, to supply the integument over the scapula and over the Latissimus dorsi. The first intercostal nerve has no lateral cutaneous branch. The lateral cuta- neous branch of the second intercostal nerve is of large size, and named, from its origin-and distribution, the intercosto-hvmeral nerve (fig. 285). It pierces the External intercostal muscle, crosses the axilla to the inner side of the arm, and ioins with a filament from the nerve of Wrisberg. It then pierces the fascia, and supplies the skin of the upper half of the inner and back part of the arm, com- municating with the internal cutaneous branch of the mnsculo-spiral nerve. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to the size of the other cutaneous nerves, especially the nerve of Wrisberg. A second i^itercosto-humeral nei-ve is frequently given off from the third intercostal. It supplies filaments to the arm-pit and inner side of the arm. Lower Intercostal Nerves. The loiver intercostal nerves (excepting the last) have the same Mgement as the upper ones as far as the anterior extremities of the intercostal spaces, where they pass behind the costal cartdages, and between the Internal oblique and Trans- versalis muscles, to the sheath of the Rectus, which they perforate. They supply the Rectus muscle, and terminate in branches which become subcutaneous near the linea alba. These branches, wHch are named the anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen, supply the integument of the frout of the belly; they are du-ected outwards as far as the lateral cutaneous nerves. The lower intercostal nerves supply the Intercostal and Abdominal muscles, and, about the middle of their course, give off lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the Extei-nal intercostal and External oblique muscles, and are distributed to the integument of the abdo- men, the anterior branches passing nearly as far forwards as the margin of the Rectus ; the posterior branches passing to supply the skm over the Latissimus dorsi, where they join the dorsal cutaneous nerves. Peculiar Dorsal Nerves. First dorsal nerve. Its roots of oricjin are similar to those of a cervical nerve Its posterior or dorsal Iranch resembles, in its mode of distribution, the dorsal br Jches of the cervical nerves. Its anteri,yr branch enters almost wholly into L formaLn of the brachial plexus, giving off, before it leaves t^e ^^^^^^^^^^^^ intercostal branch, which runs along the first intercostal space, and termmatcsLUMBAR PLEXUS. •the front of the chest, by forming the first anterior cutaneous nerve of the thorax, The first intercostal nerve gives off no lateral cutaneous branch_ ^ The last dorsal is larger than the other dorsal nerves. It. anterior branch runs along the lower bolder of the last rib m front of the Quadratus luxnborum perforates the aponeux-osis of the Transversalis, and passes forwards between it and the Internal oblique, to be distributed in the same manner as ^^l^o^tn? nerves. It communicates with the ilio-hypogastnc branch of the umbai- plexus, and is occasionally connected with the first lumbar nerve by a slender branch, the dorsi-lumbar nerve, which descends in the substance of the Quadratus lumborum. , i i r -x i The lateral cutaneous hroMcTi of the last dorsal is remarkable for its large size ; it perforates the Internal and External oblique muscles, passes downwards over the crest of the iHum, and is distributed to the integument of the front of the hip, some of its filaments extending as low down as the trochanter major. Lumbar Neeves. The lumlar nerves are five in number on each side ; the first appears between the first and second lumbar vertebrte, and the last between the last lumbar and the base of the sacrum. The roots of the lumbar nerves are the largest, and their filaments the most numerous, of all the spinal nerves, and they are closely aggregated together upon the lower end of the cord. The anterior roots are the smaller : but there is not the same disproportion between them and the posterior roots as in the cervical nerves. The roots of these nerves have a vertical direction, and are of consider- able length, more especially the lower ones, since the spinal cord does not extend beyond the first lumbar vertebra. The roots become joined in the intervertebral foramina; and the nerves, so formed, divide at their exit into two branches, anterior and posterior. The ^posterior branches of the lumbar nerves diminish in size from above down- wards ; they pass backwards between the transverse processes, and divide into external and internal branches. The External branches supply the Erector spinas and Intertransverse muscles. Erom the three upper branches, cutaneous nerves are derived, which pierce the Sacro-lumbalis and Latissimns dorsi muscles, and descend over the back part of the crest of the ilium, to be distributed to the integument of the gluteal region, some of the filaments passing as far as the trochanter major. The internal branches, the smaller, pass inwards close to the articular processes of the vertebrae, and supply the Multifidns spinas and Interspinales muscles. The anterior brandies of the lumbar nerves increase in size from above down- wards. At their origin, they communicate with the lumbar ganglia of the sym- pathetic by long slender filaments, which accompany the lumbar arteries round the sides of the bodies of the vertebra, beneath the Psoas muscle. The nerves pass obliquely outwards behind the Psoas magnus, or between its fascicuh, distributing filaments to it and the Quadratus lumborum. The anterior branches of the four upper nerves are connected together in this situation by anastomotic loops, and form the hmbar plexus. The anterior branch of the fifth lumbar, joined with a branch from the fourth, descends across the base of the sacrum to join the anterior branch of the first sacral nerve, and assist in the formation of the sacral plexus. The cord resulting from the union of these two nerves is called the lumbosacral nerve. Lumbar Plexus. The lumbar plexus is formed by the loops of communication between the anterior branches of the four upper lumbar nerves. The plexus is narrow above, and oc casionally connected with the last dorsal by a slender branch, the dorsi-lumbar nerve; it is broad below, where it is joined to the sacral plexus by the lumbo- sacral cord. It is situated in the substance of the Psoas muscle near its posterior part, in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebras.542 SPINAL NERVES. The moclo in which tho plexus is formed is the following :~The first lumbar nerve gives off tho ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves, and a communicating branch to the second lumbar nerve. The second gives oH" the external cutaneous and genito-crural, and a communicating branch to tho third nerve. The third nerve gives a descending lilament to the fourth, and divides into two branches, which assist in forming >fche anterior crural and obturator nerves; sometimes, also it furnishes a part of the accessory obturator. The fourth nerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and tho obturator, and gives off a communi- catino- branch to the fifth lumbar ; sometimes it also furnishes part of the accessory obturator. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the Ilio-hypogastric. Ilio-inguinal. Genito-crural. External cutaneous. Obturator. Accessory obturator. Anteiior crural. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of distribution. One group, including the iho-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supplies the lower part of the parietes of the abdomen ; 287.—The Lumbar Plexus and its Branches. tie otWr gronp. whicl, includes t.,o remainfag .erves, supplies tLe fore part of tho '"^T^Tiuo-h^^IsSkIvk (,„,„rio,.™«.cn(«..to.o...) arises from tl.c first543 LUMBAR PLEXUS. lumbar nerve. It pierces tbo outer border of the Psoas muscle at its upper part, and crosses obliquely in fi-ont of the Quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium. It then perforates the Transversalis muscle at its back part, and divides between it and the Internal oblique into two branches, iliac and hypogastric, _ The mac hranch pierces the Internal and External oblique muscles immediately above the crest of the ilium, and is distributed to the integument of the gluteal region, behind the lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve (hg 2go) The size of this nerve bears an inverse proportion to that of the cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve. The hypogastric hranch (fig. 288) continues onwards between the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscles. It first pierces the Internal oblique, and near the middle line perforates the External oblique above the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument covering the hypogastric region. The Ilio-inguinal Nerve (^inferior musculo-cutaneous), smaller than the pre- ceding, arises with it from the first lumbar nei-ve. It pierces the outer border of the Psoas just below the ilio-hypogastric, and, passing obliquely across the Quad- ratus lumborum and Iliacus muscles, perforates the Transversalis, near the fore part of the crest of the ilium, and communicates with the Ilio-hypogastric nerve between that muscle and the Internal oblique. The nerve then pierces the Internal oblique, distributing filaments to it, and, accompanying the spermatic cord, escapes at the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and upper and inner part of the thigh in the male, and to the labium in the female. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to that of the ilio-hypogastric. Occasionally it is very small, and ends by joining the ilio-hypogastric ; in such cases, a branch from the ilio-hypogastric takes the place of the ilio-inguinal, or the latter nerve may be altogether absent. The Genito-ceubal Nerve arises from the second lumbar, and by a few fibres from the cord of communication between it and the first. It passes obliquely through the substance of the Psoas, descends on its surface to near Poupart's ligament, and divides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital hranch descends on the external ihac artery, sending a few filaments round that vessel; it then pierces the fascia transversalis, and, passing tbrough. the internal abdominal ring, descends along the back part of the spermatic cord to the scrotum, and supplies, in the male, the Cremaster muscle. In the female, it accompanies the round ligament, and is lost upon it. The crural hranch passes along the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, beneath Poupart's ligament, into the thigh, where it pierces the fascia lata, and is distri- buted to the integument of the upper and a,nterior aspect of the thigh, communi- cating with the middle cutaneous nerve. A few filaments from this nerve may be traced on to the femoral artery; they are derived from the nerve as it passes beneath Poupart's ligament. The External Cutaneous Nerve arises from the second lumbar, or from the loop between it and the third. It perforates the outer border of the Psoas muscle about its middle, and crosses the Iliacus muscle obHquely, to the notch imme- diately beneath the anterior superior spine of the iKum, where it passes beneath Pouparts hgament into the thigh, and divides into two branches of nearly equal Size, The anUnor Iranch descends in an aponeurotic canal formed in the fascia lata, becomes superficial about four inches below Poupart's ligament, and divides into branche^ which are distributed to the integument along the anterior and outer part of the thigh, as far down as the knee. This nerve occasionally communicates with the long saphenous nerve. The posterior Iranch pierces the fascia lata, and subdivides into branches which pass across the outer and posterior surface of the thigh, supplying the integument as far as the middle of the thigh. & ' I'r j & b .

It arises by two branches : one from the third, the other from the fourth lumbar nerve. It descends through the inner fibres of the Psoas muscle, and emerges from its inner border near the brim of the pelvis ; it then runs aloncr the lateral wall of the pelvis, above the obturator vessels, to the upper part of the obturator foramen, where it enters the thigh, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch separated by the Adductor brevis muscle. The anterior hranch (fig. 289) passes down in front of the Adductor brevis, being covered by the Pectineus and Adductor longus ; and at the lower border of the latter muscle, communicates with the internal cutaneous and internal saphenous nerves, forming a kind of plexus. It then descends upon the femoral artery, upon which it is finally distributed. This nerve, near the obturator foramen, gives ofi" an articular branch to the hip.joint. Behind the Pectineus, it distributes muscular branches to the Adductor longus and GraciHs, and occasionally to the Adductor brevis and Pectineus, and receives a communicating branch from the accessory obturator nerve. Occasionally this communicating branch is continued down, as a cutaneous branch, to the thigh and leg. This occasional cutaneous branch emerges from the lower border of the Adductor longus, descends along the posterior margin of the Sai'torius to the inner side of the knee, where it pierces the deep fascia, communi- cates with the long saphenous nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the leg, as low down as its middle. When the branch is small, its place is supplied by the iuternal cutaneous nerve. The posterior branch of the obturator nerve pierces the Obturator externus, and passes behind the Adductor brevis to the front of the Adductor magnus, where it divides into numerous muscular branches, which supply the Obturator externus, the Adductor magnus, and occasionally the Adductor brevis. . The articular branch for the knee-joint perforates the lower part of the Adductor magnus, and enters the popliteal space; it then descends upon the popliteal artery, as far as the back part of the knee-joint, where it perforates the posterior ligament, and is distributed to the synovial membrane. It gives filaments to the artery in its course. The Accessory Obtueatoe Neeve (fig. 287) is of small size, and arises either from the obturator nerve near its origin, or by separate filaments from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends along the inner border of the Psoas muscle, crosses the body of the pubes, and passes beneath the Pectineus muscle, where it divides into numerous branches. One of these supplies the Pectineus, penetrating its under surface ; another is distributed to the hip-joint; while a third communi- cates with the anterior branch of the obturator nerve. This branch, when of large size, is prolonged (as already mentioned), as a cutaneous branch, to the leg. The accessory obturator nerve is not constantly found ; when absent, tke hip.joint receives branches from the obturator nerve. Occasionally it is very small, and becomes lost in the capsule of the hip-joint. The Anteeioe Ceueal Neeve (figs. 287, 289) is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. It supplies muscular branches to the lUacus, Pectineus, and all the muscles on the front of the thigh, excepting the Tensor vagina femoris; cutaneous filaments to the front and inner side of the thigh, and to the leg and foot; and articular branches to the knee. It arises from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, receiving also a fasciculus from the second. It descends through the fibres of the Psoas muscle, emergmg from it at the lower part of its outer border; and passes down between it and the Iliacus, and beneath Poupart's Hgament, into the thigh, where It becomes somewhat flattened, and divides into an anterior or cutaneous, and a posterior or muscular part. Beneath Poupart's ligament, it is separated from the femoral artery by the Psoas muscle, and lies beneath the iliac fascia. mtUn thepeMs the anterior crural nerve gives off from its outer side some small branches to the Biacus, and a branch to the femoral artery, which is dis- tributed upon the upper part of that vessel. The origin of this branch varies ; it occasionally arises higher than usual, or it may arise lower down in the thigh. NNSPINAL NKRVES.

The cutaneous nei-ve of the patella is occasionally small, and terminates by joining the internal cutaneous, which suppUes its place in front of the knee, Beloio the hnee, the branches of the long saphenous nerve are distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the leg, communicating with the cuta- neous branches from the internal cutaneous, or obturator nerve. The Deep Group of branches of the anterior crural nerve are muscular and articular. The muscular hranclies supply the Pectineus, and all the muscles on the front of the thigh, except the Tensor vaginse femoris, which is supplied fi-om the superior gluteal nerve, and the Sartorius, which is supplied by filaments from the middle or internal cutaneous nerves. The branches to the Pectineus, usually two in number, pass inwards behind the femoral vessels, and enter the muscle on its anterior surface. The branch to the Bectus muscle enters its under surface high up. The bi'anch to the Vastus extemus, of large size, follows the course of the de- scending branch of the external circumflex artery, to the lower part of the muscle. It gives off an articular filament. The branches to the Vastus internus and Crureus enter the middle of those muscles. The articular hranclies, two in number, supply the knee-joint. One, a long slender filament, is derived from the nerve to the Vastus externus. It penetrates the capsular ligament of the joint on its anterior aspect. The other is derived from the nerve to the Vastus internus. It descends along the internal inter- muscular septum, accompanying the deep branch of the anastomotica magna artery, pierces the capsular ligament of the joint on its inner side, and supplies the synovial membrane. The Saceal and Coccygeal Keeves. The sacral nerves are five in number on each side. The four upper ones pass from the sacral canal, through the sacral foramina ; the fifth through the foramen between the sacrum and coccyx. The roots of origin of the upper sacral (and lumbar) nerves are the largest of all the spinal nerves ; whilst those of the lowest sacral and coccygeal nerve are the smallest. The roots of these nerves are of very considerable length, being longer than those of any of the other spinal nerves, on account of the spinal cord not extending beyond the first lumbar vertebra. From their great length, and the appearance they present in connection with the spinal cord, the roots of origin of these nerves are called collectively the cauda equina. Each sacral and coccygeal nerve divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. '^he posterior sacral nerves axe small, diminish in size from above downwards, and emerge, except the last, from the sacral canal by the posterior sacral foramina. The three upper ones are covered, at their exit from the sacral canal, by the Multifidus spm£B, and divide into external and internal branches. The internal hranclies are small, and supply the Multifidus spinte. The external hranches communicate with one another, and with the last lumbar and fourth sacral nerves, by means of anastomosing loops. These branches pass outwards, to the outer surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they form a second series of loops beneath the Gluteus maximus. Cutaneous branches from this second series of loops, usually three in number, pierce the Gluteus maximus: one near the posterior inferior spine of the ilium ; another opposite the end of the sacrum ; and the third, midway between the other two. They supply the integu- ment over the posterior part of the gluteal region. N N 2 . .SPINAL NERVES. mi ^ 7 / ^nrrnl nPTVCs ai'O situated below the Multifidus spinoe.

This branch is occa- sionally derived from the upper part of the great sciatic nerve. The SuPEKiOR Gluteal Nerve (fig. 291) arises from the back part of the lumbo- sacral ; it passes fi-om the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatio foramen above the Pjriformis muscle, accompanied by the gluteal vessels, and divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The supei-ior branch follows the line of origin of the Gluteus minimus, and sup- plies it and the Gluteus medius. The inferior branch crosses obliquely between the Gluteus minimus and medius, distributing filaments to both these muscles, and terminates in the Tensor vagina) femoris, extending nearly to its lower end. The Pudic Nerve arises from the lower part of the sacral plexus, and leaves the pelvis, through the great saoro-sciatic foramen, below the Pyriformis. It then crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen. It accompanies the pudic vessels upwards and forwards along the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, being covered by the obturator fascia, and divides into two terminal branches, the perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis. Near its origin, it gives ofi" the inferior hfemorrhoidal nerve. The inferior hcemorrhoidal nerve is occasionally derived from the sacral plexus. It passes across the ischio-rectal fossa, with its accompanying vessels, towards the lower end of the rectum, and is distributed to the External sphincter and the integument round the anus. Branches of this nerve communicate with the inferior pudendal and superficial perineal nerves on the inner margin of the thigh. The perineal nerve, the inferior and larger of the two terminal branches of the pudic, is situated below the pudic artery. It accompanies the superficial perineal artery in the perineum, dividing into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal) are two in number, posterior and anterior. The posterior branch passes to the back part of the ischio-i-eotal fossa, distributing filaments to the Sphincter ani and integument ia front of the anus, which communicate with the inferior haemorrhoidal nerve ; it then passes forwards, with the anterior branch, to the back of the scrotum, communicating with the anterior branch and with the inferior pudendal. The anterior branch passes to the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa, in front of the preceding, and accompanies it to the scrotum and under part of the penis. This branch gives one or two fila- ments to the Levator ani. The muscular branches are distributed to the Transversus perinei. Accelerator urinae. Erector penis, and Compressor urethrse. The nerve of the bulb supplies the corpus spongiosum ; some of its filaments run for some distance on the surface, before penetrating to the interior. ' The dorsal nerve of the penis is the superior division of the pudic nerve • it accompames the pudic artery along the ramus of the ischium, and between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia; it then pierces the suspensory ligament of the perns, and accompanies the ari^eria dorsalis penis to the glans, to which it is distributed. On the penis, this nerve gives ofi" a cutaneous branch, which runs along the side of the organ; it is joined with branches of the sympathetic, and supphes the integument of the upper surface and sides of the penis and prepuce, giving a large branch to the corpus cavernosum. f f > In the female, the pudic nerve is distributed "to the parts analogous to those in the male; its superior division terminating in the clitoris, its inferior in the exter- nal labia and penneum.

It issues from the pelvis below the Pynformis muscle descends beneath the Gluteus maximus with the sciatic artery, and at the lower border of that muscle passes along the back part of the thigh, beneath the fascia lata, to the lower part of the popUteal region, where it pierces the fascia and becomes cuta- neous. It then accompanies the external saphenous vein below the middle of the leg, its terminal filaments communicating with the external saphenous nerve The branches of the small sciatic nerve are muscular (inferior gluteal) and cutaneous. rrj. a The infcnor gluteal consist of several large branches given ofi to the under surface of the Gluteus maximus, near its lower part. The cutaneous branches consist of two groups, internal and ascending. The internal ctdariemis branches are distributed to the skin at the upper and inner side of the thigh, on its posterior aspect. One branch, longer than the rest, the inferior pudendal, curves forward below the tuber ischii, pierces the fascia lata on the outer side of the ramus of the ischium, and is distributed to the integument of the scrotum, communicating with the superficial perineal nerve. The ascending cutaneous branches consist of two or three filaments, which turn upwards round the lower border of the Gluteus maximus, to supply the integument covering its surface. One or two filaments occasionally descend along the outer side of the thigh, supplying the integument as far as the middle of that region. Two or three branches are given off from the lesser sciatic nerve as it descends beneath the fascia of the thigh ; they supply the integument of the back part of the thigh, popliteal region, and upper part of the leg. The Great Sciatic Nerve (fig. 291) supplies nearly the whole of the integument of the leg, the muscles of the back of the thigh, and those of the leg and foot. It is the largest nervous cord in the body, measuring three quarters of an inch in breadth, and is the continuation of the lower part of the sacral plexus. It passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the Pyriformis muscle. It descends between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, along the back part of the thigh to about its lower third, where it divides into two large branches, the internal and external popliteal nerves. This division may take place at any point between the sacral plexus and the lower thii'd of the thigh. When the division occurs at the plexus, the two nerves descend together, side by side; or they may be separated, at their commencement, by the interposition of part or the whole of the Pyriformis muscle. As the nerve descends along the back of the thigh, it rests at first upon the External rotator muscles, together with the small sciatic nerve and artery, being covered by the Gluteus maximus ; lower down, it lies upon the Adductor magnus, and is covered by the long head of the Biceps. The branches of the nerve, before its division, are articular and muscular. The articular branches arise from the upper part of the nerve ; they supply the hip-jomt, perforating its fibrous capsule posteriorly. These branches are some- times derived from the sacral plexus. ^ The muscular branches are distributed to the Plexors of the leg: viz., the Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semimembranosus, and a branch to the Adductor magnus. These branches are given off beneath the Biceps muscle. The Internal Popliteal Nerve, the larger of the two terminal branches of the great sciatic, descends along the back part of the thigh through the middle of the popliteal space, to the lower paxt of the Popliteus muscle, where it passes with the arteiy beneath the arch of the Soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial. It lies at first very superficial, and at the outer side of the popliteal vessels ; opposite the knee-jomt, it is m close relation with the vessels, and crosses the ai-tery to its inner side. The branches oi this nerve are articular, muscular, and a cutaneous branch, the external or short saphenous nerve.552 SPINAL NERVES. 292.—The Plantar Nerves. The articular branches, usually tliroo in number, supply the knee-joint: two of these branclies accompany the superior and inferior internal articular arteries; and a third, the azygos. . n xi -i. v The viusctdar hranches, four or five in number, arise from the nerve as it lies bet>veen the two heads of the Gastrocnemius muscle; they supply that muscle, the Plantaris, Soleus, and Popliteus. The nerves which supply the Popl.teus turn round its lower border and are distributed to its deep surf ace. The external ov short saphenous nerve (fig. 290) descends between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius muscle, and, about the middle of the back of the leg, pierces the deep fascia, and receives, a communicating branch {commmx%cans peronei) from the external popliteal nerve. The nerve then continues its course down the leg near the outer margin of the tendo Achillis, in company with the external saphe- nous vein, winds round the outer malleolus, and is distributed to the integument along the outer side of the foot and little toe, communicating on the dorsum of the foot with the musculo-cutaneous nerve. c .1, t> The vosierior tibial nerve (fig. 291) commences at the lower border of the Pop- liteus muscle, and passes along the back part of the leg with the postenor tibial vessels to the interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, where it divides into the external and internal plantar nerves. It lies upon the deep muscles of the leg, and is covered by the deep fascia, the superficial muscles and integument In the upper part of its course, it lies to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery, but it soon crosses that vessel, and lies to its outer side as far as the ankle. In the lower third of the leg, it is placed parallel with the inner margin of the tendo Achillis. The branches of the posterior tibial nerve are muscular and plantar-cutaneous. The muscular branches arise either separately or by a common trunk from the upper part of the nerve. They supply the Tibialis posticus, Flexor longus digi- torum, and Flexor longus pollicis muscles; the branch to the latter muscle accom- panying the peroneal artery. The plantar cutaneous branch perfo- rates the internal annular ligament, and supplies the integument of the heel and inner side of the sole of the foot. The internal plantar nerve (fig. 292), the larger of the two terminal branches of the posterior tibial, accompanies the internal plantar artery along the inner side of the foot. From its origin at the inner ankle it passes forwards between the Abductor pollicis and Flexor brevis digitorum, divides opposite the bases of the metatarsal bones into four digital branches, and communicates with the external plantar nerve.

It will be observed, that the distribution of these branches is precisely similar to that of the median nerve m the hand. Each digital nerve gives off cutaneous and articular filaments; and opposite the last phalanx sends a dorsal branch, which supplies the structure round the nail, the continuation of the nerve being distributed to the ball of the toe. The external plantar nerve, the smaller of the two, completes the nervous supply to the structui-es of the foot, being distributed to the little toe and one half of the fourth, as well as to most of the deep muscles, its distribution being similar to that of the ulnar in the hand. It passes obliquely forwards with the external plantar artery to the outer side of the foot, lying between the Flexor brevis digitorum and Flexor accessorius; and, in the interval between the former muscle and Abductor minimi digiti, divides into a superficial and a deep branch. Before its division, it supplies the Flexor accessorius and Abductor minimi digiti. The superficial branch separates into two digital nerves: one, the smaller of the two, supplies the outer side of the little toe, the Flexor brevis minimi digiti, and the two interosseous muscles of the fourth metatarsal space ; the other, and larger digital branch, suppHes the adjoining sides of the fourth and fifth toes, and communicates with the internal plantar nerve. The deep or muscular branch accompanies the external plantar artery into the deep part of the sole of the foot, beneath the tendons of the Flexor muscles and Adductor polHcis, and supplies all the interossei (except those in the fourth meta- tarsal space), the two outer Lumbricales, the Adductor pollicis, and the Transversus pedis. The External Popliteal or Peroneal Nerve (fig. 291), about one half the size of the internal popliteal, descends obliquely along the outer side of the popliteal space to the fibula, close to the margin of the Biceps muscle. It is easily felt beneath the skin behind the head of the fibula, at the inner side of the tendon of the Biceps, About an inch below the head of the fibula it pierces the origin of the Peroneus longus, and divides beneath that muscle into the anterior tibial and musculo- cutaneous nerves. The branches of the peroneal nerve, previous to its division, are articular and cutaneous. The articular branches, two in number, accompany the superior and inferior external articular arteries to the outer side of the knee. The upper one occasion, ally arises from the great sciatic nerve before its bifurcation, A third (recurrent) articular nerve is given off at the point of division of the peroneal nerve; it as- cends with the tibial recurrent artery through the Tibialis anticus muscle to the front of the knee, which it supplies. The cutaneous branches, two or three in number, supply the integument along the back part and outer side of the leg, as far as its middle or lower part; one of these, larger than the rest, the communicans peronei, arises near the head of the fibula, crosses the external head of the Gastrocnemius to the middle of the leg, and joins with the external saphenous. This nerve occasionally exists as a separate branch, which is continued down as far as the heel The Anterior Tibial Nerve (fig. 289) commences at the bifurcation of the peroneal nerve, between the fibula and upper part of the Peroneus longus, passes obliquely forwards beneath the Extensor longus digitorum to the fore pari of the interosseous naembrane, and reaches the outer side of the anterior tibial artery above the middle of the leg; it then descends with the artery to the front of the ankle-jomt, where it divides into an external and an internal branch. This nerve lies at first on the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, then in front of it, and again at its outer side at the ankle-joint.554 SPINAL NKRVES. The hyanch'8 of tbc anterior tibial nerve, in its course through the leg are the musculai- nerves to the Tibialis anticus, Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, and Extensor proprius pollicis muscles. The exiernal or tarsal hranoh of tho anterior tibial passes outwards acioss the tarsus beneath the Extensor brovis digitorum, and, having become ganglionic, HkTthe rsterior interosseous nerve at the wrist, supplies the Extensor brevis ditritorum and the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus. ... .. The internal branch, the continuation of the nerve, accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery along the inner side of the dorsum of the foot and at the first int«r- n^soous space divides into two branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, communicating with the internal division of the musculo- fccX'OntoneoMS Nerve (fig. 289) supplies the muscles on the fibular side of the leg, and the integument of the dorsum of the foot. It passes forwards between the Peronei muscles and the Extensor longus digitorum pierces the deep fascia at the lower third of the leg, on its front and outer side, and divides into two branches. This nerve, in its course between the muscles, grves off muscu a, branches to the Peroneus longus and brevis, and cutaneous filaments to the m- tegument of the lower part of the leg. fT,^ The internal hranoh of the musculo-cutaneous nerve passes m front of the ankle-ioint and along the dorsum of the foot, supplymg the inner side ot the treet C and the adjoining sides of the second and third toes. It also supplies lie in eeument of the inne? ankle and imier side of the foot, communicating with the inteLaTsaphenous nerve, and joins with the anterior tibial nerve, between the ^^thT"w^^ larger, P-- along the outer side of th^^^^^^^ the foot, to be distributed to the adjoining sides of the third, fourth and fifth to^s It also supplies the integument of the outer ankle and outer side of the foot, com TniiTi^pnHnB- with the short saphenous nerve. e^„^A T^ZtMion of these branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve be found to vary • together, they supply all the toes excepting the outer side of the little toe, and the adjoining sides of the great and second toes.The Sympathetic Nerve. THE Sympattetic Nerve is so called from the opinion entertained that through it is produced a sympathy between the affections of distant organs. It con- sists of a series of ganglia, connected together by intervening cords, extending on each side of the vertebral column from the base of the skull to the coccyx. It may, moreover, be traced up into the head, where the ganglia (which are all m connection with the fifth cranial nerve) occupy spaces between the cranial and facial bones. These two gangliated cords He parallel with one another as far as the sacrum, on which bone they converge, communicating together through a single ganglion {ganglion impar), placed in front of the coccyx. Some anatomists also state that the two cords are joined at their cephalic extremity, through a small ganglion (the ganglion of Ribes), situated upon the anterior communicating artery. Moreover, the chains of opposite sides coromunicate between these two extremities in several parts, by means of the nervous cords that arise from them. The ganglia are somewhat less numerous than the vertebrae : thus there are only three in the cervical region, twelve in the dorsal, four in the lumbar, five in the sacral, and one in the coccygeal. The sympathetic nerve, for convenience of description, may be divided into several parts, according to the position occupied by each; and the number of ganglia, of which each "part is composed, may be thus arranged : Cephalic portion 4 ganglia. Cervical „ 3 „ Dorsal „ 12 „ Lumbar ,, 4 „ Sacral „ 5 n Coccygeal „ I „ Each ganglion may be regarded as a distinct centre, from or to which branches pass in various directions. These branches may be thus arranged :—i. Branches of communication between the ganglia. 2. Branches of communication with the cerebral or spiaal nerves. 3. Primary branches passing to be distributed to the arteries in the yicuaity of the ganglia, and to the viscera, or proceeding to other ganglia placed in the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis, 1. The branches of communication between the ganglia are composed of grey and white nerve-fibres, the latter being continuous with those fibres of the spinal nerves which pass to the ganglia. 2. The branches of communication between the ganglia and the cerebral or spmal neiwes also consist of a white and a grey portion ; the former proceeding from the spmal nerve to the ganglion, the latter passing from the ganglion to the spmal nerve. 3. The primary branches of distribution also consist of two kinds of nerve- fibres, the sympathetic and spinal. They have a remarkable tendency to form intricate plexuses, which encn-cle the blood-vessels, and are conducted by them to the viscera. The greater number, however, of these branches pass to a series of visceral ganglia : these are ganghonic masses, of variable size, situated in the nSl 'fTl of the trunk, the thorax, and abdomen; and are connected with tho roots of the great arteries of the viscera. The visceral ganglia are single and unsym- metrical, and are called the cardmc and semilunar. From these visceral ganglia numerous plexuses of nerves are derived, which entwine round the blood-fessels, and are conducted by them to tho viscera.SYMPATHETIC NERVE. 293.—The Sympathetic Nerve.

The cephalic portion of tlie sympathetic consists of four ganglia:—i. The ophthalmic ganglion. 2. The spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion. 3. The otic, or Arnold's ganglion. 4. The submaxiUary ganglion. These have been already described in connection with the three divisions of the fifth nerve. Ceevical Portion of the Sympathetic. The cervical portion of the sympathetic consists of three ganglia on each side, which are distinguished according to their position, as the superior, middle, and inferior cervical. The Superior Cervical Ganglion, the largest of the three, is placed opposite the second and third cervical vertebrae, and sometimes as low as the fourth or fifth. It is of a reddish-grey colour, and usually fusiform in shape : sometimes broad, and occasionally constricted at intervals, so as to give rise to the opinion, that it con- sists of the coalescence of several smaller ganglia. It is in relation, in front, with the sheath of the internal carotid artery, and internal jugular vein ; behind it lies on the Rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Its branches may be divided into superior, inferior, external, internal, and anterior. The superior hranch appears to be a direct continuation of the ganglion. It is soft in texture, and of a reddish colour. It ascends by the side of the internal carotid artery, and, entering the carotid canal in the temporal bone, divides into two branches, which he, one on the outer, and the other on the inner side, of that vessel. The oi.der hranch, the larger of the two, distributes filaments to the internal carotid artery, and forms the carotid plexus. The inner branch also distributes filaments to the internal carotid, and, con- tinuing onwards, forms the cavernous plexus. Carotid Plexus. The carotid plexus is situated on the outer side of the internal carotid. Eilaments from this plexus occasionally form a small gangliform swelling on the under surface of the artery, which is called the carotid ganglion. The carotid plexus communicates with the Casserian ganglion, with the sixth nerve, and spheno-palatine ganglion, and distributes filaments to the waU of the carotid artery, and to the dura mater (Valentin). The communicating branches with the sixth nerve consist of one or two filaments, which join that nerve as it lies upon the outer side of the internal carotid. Other filaments are also connected with the Casserian ganglion. The communication with the spheno-palatine ganglion is effected by the carotid portion of the Vidian nerve, which passes forwards, through the cartilaginous substance filling the foramen lacerum medium, along the pterygoid or Vidian canal, to the spheno- palatine ganglion. In this canal it joins the petrosal branch of the Vidian. Cavernous Plexus. The cavernous plexus is situated below, and internal to that part of the internal carotid, which is placed by the side of the sella Turcica, in the cavernous sinus and 18 formed chiefly by the internal division of the ascending branch from the' superior cervical ganglion. It communicates with the third, fourth, fifth and sixth nerves, and with the ophthalmic ganglion, and distributes filaments to the waU of the internal carotid.^ The branch of communication with the third nerve joms It at Its pomt of division ; the branch to the fourth nerve joins it as it lies on the outer wall of the cavernous sinus; other filaments are connected with the under surface of the trunk of the ophthalmic nerve; and a second filament of communication joins the sixth nerve.

The most important of these branches constitutes the inferior cardiac nerve, to be presently described. The external branches consist of several filaments, some of which communicato with the seventh and eighth spinal nerves; others accompany the vertebral artery along the vertebral canal, forming a plexus round the vessel, supplying it with filaments, and communicating with the cervical spinal nerves as high as the fourth. Caediao Nervbs. The cardiac nerves are three in number on each side : superior, middle, and inferior, one being derived from each of the cervical ganglia. The superior cardiac nerve (nervus superficialis cordis) ai'ises by two or more branches from the superior cervical ganglion, and occasionally receives a filament from the cord of communication between the first and second cervical ganglia. It runs down the neck behind the common carotid artery, lying upon the Longus colli muscle ; and crosses in front of the inferior thyroid artery, and the recurrent lai'yngeal nerve. The right superior cardiac nerve, at the root of the neck, passes either in front of or behind the subclavian artery, and along the arteria iimominata, to the back part of the arch of the aorta, where it joins the deep cardiac plexus. This nerve, in its course, is connected with other branches of the sympathetic; about the middle of the neck it receives filaments from the external laryngeal nerve ; lower down, one or two twigs from the pneumogastric ; and as it enters the thorax, it joins with the recurrent laryngeal. Filaments from this nerve accompany the inferior thyroid artery to the thyroid gland. The left superior cardiac nerve rans by the side of the left carotid artery, and in front of the arch of the aorta, to the superficial cardiac plexus ; but occasionally it passes behind the aorta, and terminates in the deep cardiac plexus. The middle cardiac nerve (nervus cardiacus magnas), the largest of the three, arises from the middle cervical ganglion, or from the cord between the middle and inferior gangha. On the right side, it descends behind the common carotid artery; and at the root of the neck, passes either in front of or behind the sub- clavian artery; it then descends on the trachea, receives a few filaments from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and joins the deep cardiac plexus. In the neck, it communicates with the superior cardiac and recurrent laryngeal nerves. On the left side, the middle cardiac nerve enters the chest between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and joins the left side of the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior- cardiac nerve (nervus cardiacus minor) arises from the inferior cervical or first thoracic ganglion. It passes down behind the subclavian artery, and along the front of the trachea, to join the deep cardiac plexus. It communi- cates freely behind the subclavian artery with the recurrent laryngeal and middle cardiac nerves. The great or deep cardiac plexus {plexus magmis profundus—Scarpa) is situated m front of the trachea at its bifurcation, above the point of division of the pul- monary artery and behind the arch of the aorta. It is formed by the cardiac nerves derived from the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, and the cardiac branches of the recurrent laryngeal and pneumogastric. The only cardiac nerves which do not enter into _ the formation of this plexus are the left superior cardiac nerve, and the left mfenor cardiac branch from the pneumogastric. The branches derived from the great cardiac plexus form the posterior coronary plexus, and part of the anterior coronaiy plexus; whilst a few filaments proceed to the pul- monary plexuses, and to the auricles of the heart J^^l;™'''^^! ^'T ""^^'^ "^'^'^ ^^'^ plexus pass, some in front of and others behind the right pulmonary artery; the former, the more numerous, transmit a few filaments to the anterior pulmonary plexus, and are continued along the trunk56o SYMPATHETIC NERVE.

It descends obliquely inwards in front of the bodies of the vertebne along the posterior mediastinum, perforates the crus of the Diaphragm, and terminates in the semilunar ganglion, distributing filaments to the renal plexus and suprarenal capsule. The lesser splanchnic nerve is formed by filaments from the tenth and eleventh ganglia, and from the cord between them. It pierces the Diaphragm with the preceding nerve, and joins the cosliac plexus. It communicates in the chest with the great splanchnic nerve, and occasionally sends filaments to the renal plexus. The smallest or renal sjjlanchmc nerve arises from the last ganglion, and piercing the Diaphragm, terminates in the renal plexus and lower part of the coeliac plexus. It occasionally communicates with the preceding nerve. A striking analogy appears to exist between the splanchnic and the cardiac nerves. The cai'diac nerves are three in number ; they arise from the three cer- vical ganglia, and are distributed to a lai'ge and important organ in the thoracic cavity. The splanchnic nerves, also three in number, are connected probably "with all the dorsal ganglia, and are distributed to important organs in the abdo- minal cavity. The epigastric or solar plexus suppHes all the viscera in the abdominal cavity. It consists of a great network of nerves and ganglia, situated behind the stomach and in front of the aorta and crura of the Diaphragm. It surrounds the coeliac axis and root of the superior mesenteric artery, extending downwards as low as the pancreas, and outwards to the suprarenal capsules. This plexus, and the gangHa connected with it, receive the great splanchnic nerve of both sides, part of the lesser splanchnic nerves, and the termination of the right pneumogastric. It distributes filaments, vrhich accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches from the front of the abdominal aorta. The semilunar ganglia, of the solar plexus, two in number, one on each side are the largest gangHa in the body. They are large irregular gangliform masses, formed by the aggregation of smaller gangHa, having interspaces between them! They are situated by the side of the coeliac axis and superior mesenteric artery, close to the suprarenal capsules : the one on the right side lies beneath the vena cava; the upper part of each ganglion is joined by the greater and lesser splanch- nic nerves, and to the inner side of each the branches of the solar plexus are con- nected. From the solar plexus are derived the following : Phrenic or Diaphragmatic plexus. Suprarenal plexus. Ca3Hac plexus. Renal plexus. Gastric plexus. Superior mesenteric plexus. Hepatic plexus. Spermatic plexus. Splenic plexus. Inferior mesenteric plexus. The phrenic plexus accompanies tlie phrenic artery to the Diaphragm, which it supplies, some filaments passing to the suprarenal capsule. It arises from the upper part of the semilunar ganglion, and is larger on the right than on the left ^ I" +1, ^^^^ plexus, on the right side, at its point of junction with the phremc nerve, is a small ganglion (gangHon diaphragmaticum) This ganglion IS placed on the under surface of the Diaphragm, near the suprarenal capsule. Its branches are distributed to the vena cava, suprarenal capsule, and the hepatic plexus. There is no ganglion on the left side The suprarenal plexus is formed hjhmr^ohes from the solar plexus, from the semilunar ganglion, and from the splanchnic and phrenic nerves, a gangHon bein.. gland. The branches of tbs plexus are remarkable for their large size, in com- parison with the size of the organ they supply The renal plexus is formed by filaments from the solar plexus, the outer part of the semilunar gangHon, and the aortic plexus.

The Lumbar Portion ok the Sympathetic. The lumbar portion of the sympathetic is situated in front of the vertebral column, along the inner margin of the Psoas muscle. It consists usually of four ganglia, connected together by interganglionic cords. The ganglia are of small size, of a greyish colour, shaped like a barleycorn, and placed much nearer the median line than the thoracic ganglia. The superior and inferior branches of the lumbar ganglia serve as communi- cating branches between the chain of ganglia in this region. They are usually single and of a white colour. The external branches communicate with the lumbar spinal nerves. From the situation of the lumbar ganglia, these branches are longer than in the other regions. They are usually two in number for each ganglion, and accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides of the bodies of the vertebrte, passing beneath the fibrous arches from which some of the fibres of the Psoas muscle arise. The internal branches pass inwards, in front of the aorta, and form the lumbar aortic plexus, already described. Other branches descend in front of the common iliac arteries, and join, over the promontory of the sacrum, to form the hypogastric plexus. Numerous delicate filaments are also distributed to the bodies of the vertebrae, and the ligaments connecting them. Pelvic Portion of the Sympathetic. The pelvic portion of the sympathetic is situated in front of the sacrum, along the inner side of the anterior sacral foramina. It consists of four or five small gangha on each side, connected together by interganglionic cords. Below, these cords converge and unite on the front of the coccyx, by means of a small ganglion (ganglion impar). The superior and inferior branches are the cords of communication between the gangha above and below. The external branches, exceedingly short, communicate with the sacral nerves. They are two in number to each ganglion. The coccygeal nerve communicates either with the last sacral, or coccygeal ganglion. The internal branches commiinicate, on the .front of the sacrum, -with the corresponding branches from the opposite side ; some, from the first two ganglia, pass to jom the pelvic plexus, and others form a plexus, which accompanies'^the middle sacral artery. The hypogastric plexus supplies the viscera of the pelvic cavity. It is situated in front of the promontory of the sacrum, between the two common iliac arteries, and IS formed by the union of numerous filaments, which descend on each side from the aortic plexus, from the lumbar ganglia, and from the first two sacral gangha. This plexus contains no ganglia ; and bifurcates, below, into two lateral portions, which form the inferior hypogastric, or pelvic plexuses. Inferior Hypogastric, or Pelvic Plexus. The inferior hypogastric, or pelvic plexus, is situated at the side of the rectum and bladder in the male, and at the side of the rectum, vagina, and bladder, in the female. It is formed by a continuation of the hypogastric plexus, by branches from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves, and by a few filaments from the sacral ganglia. At the pomt of junction of these nerves, small ganglia are found. From this plexus numerous branches are distributed to all the viscera of the pelvis. They accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery The mjerzor hmnovrhoidal plexus arises from the back part of the pelvic ?ioSpW joining with branches of the superior hLor- The vesical plexus arises from the fore part of the pelvic plexus. The nerves composing it are numerous, and contain a large proportion of spinal nerve fibres. 0 o 2564 SYMPATHETIC NERVE. 204 —Gaii'vlia and Nerves of the Gravid Uterus at tlie end of the Niutli Month. ^ ° After Ur. li.

They accompany the vesical arteries, and are distributed at the side and base of the bladder. Numerous filaments also pass to the vesiculiB sominalos, and vas deferens : those accompanying the vas deferens join, on the spermatic cord, with branches from the spermatic plexus. The prostatic plexus is continued from the lower part of the pelvic plexus. The nerves composing it are of large size. They are distributed to the prostate gland, vesicula3 seminales, and erectile structure of the penis. The nerves supplying the erectile structure of the penis consist of two sets, the small and large cavernous nerves. They are slender filaments, which arise from the fore part of the prostatic plexus ; and after joining with branches from the internal pudic nerve, pass for- wards beneath the pubic arch. The small coAiemous nerves perforate the fibrous covering of the penis, near its roots. The la/rge cavernous nerve passes forwards along the dorsum of the penis, joins with the dorsal branch of the pudic nerve, and is distributed to the corpus caver- nosum and spongiosum. The vaginal plexus arises from the lower part of the pelvic plexns. It is lost on the walls of the vagina, being distributed to the erectile tissue at its anterior part, and to the mucous membrane. The nerves composing this plexus contain, like the vesical, a large proportion of spinal nerve-fibres. The uterine nerves arise from the lower part of the hypogastric plexus, above the point where the branches from the sacral nerves join the pelvic plexus. They accompany the uterine arteries to the side of the organ between the layers of the broad ligament, and are distributed to the cervix and lower part of the body of the uterus, penetrating its substance. Other filaments pass separately to the body of the uterus and Fallopian tube. Branches from the hypogastric plexus accompany the uterine ai-teries into the substance of the uterus. Upon these filaments ganglionic enlargements are found. For a detailed account of the supply of nerves to the uterus, and for a description of the changes which these nerves and their ganglia undergo during pregnancy, the reader IS referred to the papers on ' The Anatomy of the Nerves of the Uterus,' published bv Dr. Robert Lee. •'Organs of Sense. mHB oi-ans of tlie senses are five in number, vi/., those of touch of taste of i smell" of hearing, and of sight. The skin, which is the principal seat of the sense of touch, has been described in the Introduction. The Tongue. The Tongue is the organ of the special sense of taste. It is s^t^^^^i^ floor of the mouth, in the interval between the two lateral portions of the body ot —Upper Surface of the Tongue.

Its apex or tip, thin and naiTOW, is directed forwards against the inner surface of the lower incisor teeth. The under siu-face of the tongue is connected with the lower jaw by the Genio-hyo-glossi muscles; from its sides, the mucous membrane is reflected to the inner surface of the gums ; and, in front, a distinct fold of that membrane, the frcemim Unguce, is formed beneath its under surface. The Up of the tongue, part of its under surface, its sides, and dorsum, are free. The darsum of the tongue is convex, marked along the middle lino by a raphe, which divides it into two symmetrical halves ; and this raphe terminates behind, about half an inch from the base of the organ, a little in front of a deep mucous follicle, the/orameii ciecum. The anterior two-thirds of this surface are rough, and covered with papillae; the posterior third is more smooth, and covered by the projecting orifices of numerous muciparous glands. The mucous membrane invests the entire extent of the free surface of the tongue. On the under surface of the organ it is thin and smooth, and may be traced on either side of the frsenum, through the ducts of the submaxillary glands; and between the sides of the tongue and the lower jaw, through the ducts of the sub- lingual glands. As it passes over the borders of the organ, it gradually assumes its papillary character. The mucous membrane of the tongue consists of structures analogous to those of the skin, namely, a ctitis or corium, supporting numerous jpapt'ZZcB, and covered, as well as the papillee, with epithelium. The cutis is tough, but thinner and less dense than in most parts of the skin, and is composed of similar tissue. It contains the ramifications of the numerous vessels and nei'ves from which the papillse are supplied, and afibrds insertion to all the intrinsic muscular fibres of the oi-gan. The papillae of the tongue are thickly distributed over the whole of its upper STU'face, giving to it its characteristic roughness. They are more prominent than those of the skin, standing out from the surface like the villi of the mtestine. The principal varieties are the papilla maximse (cii-cumvallatae), papillse mediaa (fungiformes), and papillse minimae (conicse or filiformes). The papillee maximce (circumvallatse) are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are situated at the back part of the dorsum of the tongue, near its base, forming a row on each side, which running backwards and inwards, meet in the middle line, like the two lines of the letter V inverted. Each papilla consists of a central flattened projection of. mucous membrane, circular in form, from ^L- to -jJ^ of an inch wide, attached to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression of the mucous membrane ; the exposed part being covered with numerous small papillae. The cup-shaped depression forms a kind of fossa round the papilla, having a circular margin of about the same elevation, covered with smaller papillre. The fissure corresponding to the papilla, which is situated at the junction of the two lines of the circumvallate papillse, is so large and deep, that the name foravien cacum has been applied to it. In the smaller papillse, the fissure exists only on one side. The papillcB medice (fungiformes), more numerous than the preceding, are scattered irregularly and sparingly over the dorsum of the tongue ; but are found chiefly at its sides and apex. They are easily recognised, among the other papilla3, by their large size, rounded eminences, and deep red colour. They are narrow at their attachment to the tongue, but broad and rounded at their free extremities, and covered with secondary papillse. Their epithelial investment is very thm. The papillee minima} (conicse—filiformes) cover the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum of the tongue. They arc very minute, more or less conical or filiform in shape, and arranged in lines corresponding in direction with the two rows of the papillaa circumvallate j exceptirg at the apex of the organ, where their direction568 ORGANS OF SENSE. is Iransverso Tlie mifonn pupillw are of a whitish tint, owing to the thickness and density of their epithelium ; thoy are covered with numerous secondary paplllaa, are firmer and more elastic than the papillsa of mucous membrane generally, and often enclose minute hairs. , n Simple papUI<r. similar to those of the skm, are dispersed very unequally among the compound forms, and exist sparingly on the surface of the tongue hehmd the circnmvallato variety, buried under a layer of epithehura.

If the epithelium is removed,'it will be found that they are not simple processes like the papdlas of the skin for the surface of each is studded with minute conical processes of the mucous membrane, which form secondary papUliB (Todd and Bowman). In the papilliB circumvallatas, the nerves are numerous and of large size; m the papillas fun<-iformes they are also numerous, and terminate in a plexiform net-work from which brush.like branches proceed ; in the papilla filiformes, their mode ot ter- mination is uncertain. ■ -j j -xt. Besides the pa,pilte, the mucous membrane of the tongue is provided with numerous folHcles and glands. . The follicles are found scattered over its entire surface, but are especially numerous between the papilla? circumvallatae and the epiglottis. The mucous glands (Ungual), similar in structure to the labial and buccal, are found chiefly beneath the mucous membrane of the posterior third of the dorsum of the tongue. There is a small group of these glands beneath the tip ot the tongue, a few along the borders of the organ, a,nd some infrontof thecircumvallate papillae projecting in the muscular substance. Their ducts open either upon the surface, or into the depressions round the large papillse. . ^ . The epithelium is of the scaly variety like that of the epidermis. It covers the free surface of the tongue, as may be easily demonstrated by maceration, or bod- ng when it can be detached entire: it is much thinner than m the skm: tlie inSrvals between the large papilla, are not filled up by it. but each papilla has a separate investment from root to summit.

The inferior longitudinal fibres are formed by the Lingualis muscle, already described (p. 229). The transverse fibres are placed between the two preceding layers ; they are intermixed with a considerable quantity of adipose substance, and form the chief part of the substance of the organ. They are attached internally to the median fibrous septnm; and, passing outwards, the posterior ones taking an arched conrse, are inserted into the dorsum and margins of the organ, intersecting the other muscular fibres. The art&ries of the tongue are derived from the lingual, the facial, and ascending phai'yngeal. The nerves of the tongue are three in number in each half: the gustatory branch of the fifth, which is distributed to the papilte at the fore part and sides of the tongue; the lingual branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, which is distributed to the mucous membrane at the base and side of the tongue, and to the papillae circnmvallat89 ; and the hypoglossal nerve, which is distributed to the muscular substance of the tongue. The two former are nerves of common sensation and of taste ; the latter is the motor nerve of the tongue. The Nose. The Nose is the special organ of the sense of smell: by means of the peculiar properties of its nerves, it protects the lungs from the inhalation of deleterious gases, and assists the organ of taste in discriminating the properties of food. The organ of smell consists of two parts, one external, the nose ; the other internal, the nasal fossae. The 710S6 is the more anterior and prominent part of the organ of smell. It is of a triangular form, directed vertically downwards, and projects from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Its summit, or root, is connected directly with the forehead. Its inferior part, the base of the nose, presents two 297, 298. Seen fro in heZow -Cartilages of the Nose.

They have been described above (p. 214). . , • The integument covering tlio dorsum and sides of the nose is thin, and loosely connected with the subjacent parts ; but where it forms the tip, or lobe, and the ate of the nose, it is thicker and more firmly adherent. It is furnished with a large number of sebaceous follicles, the orifices of which are usuaUy very distinct. The mucous membrane, lining the interior of the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with that which lines the nasal fossae within. The arteries of tie nose are the lateralis nasi, from the facial, and the nasal artery of the septum, from the superior coronary, which supplies the alas and septum ; the sides and dorsum being supplied from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic and the infraorbital. The veins of the nose terminate in the facial and ophthalmic. The nei-ves of the nose are branches from the facial, infraorbital, and infra- trochlear, and a filament from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. Nasal Foss^. The nasal fossse are two irregular cavities, situated in the middle of the face and extending from before backwards. They open in front by the two anterior nares, and terminate in the pharynx, behind, by the posterior nares. The baun- daries of these cavities, and the openings which are connected with them, as they exist in the skeleton, have been already described (pp. 72-74). The mucous membrane lining the nasal fossae is called the pitidtary, from the nature of its secretion ; or Schneiderian, from Schneider, the first anatomist who showed that the secretion proceeded from the mucous membrane, and not, as was formerly imagined, from the brain. It is intimately adherent to the periosteum, or perichondrium, over which it lies. It is continuous externally with the skin, through the anterior nares, and with the mucous membrane of the pharynx, through the posterior nares. From the nasal foss^ its continuity may be traced with the conjunctiva, through the nasal duct and lachrymal canals ; with the lining membrane of the tympanum and mastoid cells, through the Eustachian tube; and with the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal sinuses, and the antrum maxillare, through the several openings in the meatuses. The mucous membrane is thickest, and most vascular, over the turbinated bones. It is also thick over the septum ; but, in the intervals between the spongy bones, and on the floor of the nasal fossae, it is very thin. Where it lines the various sinuses and the antrum maxillare, it is thin and pale. The surface of the membrane is covered with a layer of tesselated epithelium, at the upper part of the nasal fossse, corresponding with the distribution of the olfactory nerve, but is ciliated throughout the rest of its extent, excepting near the aperture of the nares. This membrane is also provided with a nearly continuous layer of branched mucous glands, the ducts of which open upon its surface. They are most nume- rous at the middle and back parts of the nasal fossae, and largest at the lower and back part of the septum. Owing to the great thickness of this membrane, the nasal fossro are much naa-- rower, and the turbinated bones, especially the lower ones, appear larger, and more promment than m the skeleton. From the same circumstance, also, the various apertures communicating with the meatuses are either narrowed or completely In the svj^erior meatus ihe aperture of communication with the posterior ethmoidal cells is considerably diminished in size, and the spheno-palatine foramen completely covered in, ^ In the mt-cZrfZe j«ea<Ms, the opening of the infundibulum is partially hidden by a projectmg fold of mucous membrane, and the orifice of the antrum is contracted to a small circular aperture, much narrower than in the skeleton.572 ORGANS OF SEN^E. In the mferior vwalux, the oi-ifice of tbo nasal duct is partially bidden by either a sinde or'double valvular mucous fold, and the anterior palatine canal either completely closed in, or a tubular cuUdcsao of mucous memhrane is continued a short distance into it. , , . . t „v,j 4v In the roof the opening leading to the sphenoidal smus is narrowed, and the apertures in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid completely closed in The arteries of the nasal fossm are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, from the ophthalmic, which supply the ethmoidal cells, frontal sinuses, and roof of the nose the spheno-palatiue, from tlic internal maxillary, which supphes the mucous membrane covering the spongy bones, the meatuses and septum ; and the alveolar Wch of the internal maxillary, which supplies the lining membrane of the antrum. The ramifications of these vessels form a close, plexiform network, beneath and in the substance of the mucous membrane. The vems of the nasal fossm form a close network beneath the mucous mem- hrane They pass, some with the veins accompanying the spheno-palatine artery, through the spheno-palatine foramen; and others, through the alveolar branch, ioin the facial vein ; some accompany the ethmoidal arteries, and terminate m the Ophthalmic vein; and, lastly, a few communicate with the vems m the interior of the skull, through the foramina i,. o:^^ in the cribriform plate of the soo.-Nerves of Septum of Nose.

The nerves are, the olfactory, the nasal branch of the ophthal- mic, filaments from the anterior dental branch of the superior maxillary, the Vidian, naso- palatine, descending anterior palatine, and spheno-palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. The olfactory, the special nerve of the sense of smell, is distributed over the upper thii-d of the septum, and over the sur- face of the superior and middle spongy bones. The nasal branch of the oph- _ , n ^t. >. „„a thalmic distributes filaments to the upper and anterior part of the septum, and outer wall of the nasal fossae. ■ Filaments from the anterior denial branch of the superior maxillary supply the inferior meatus and inferior turbinated bone.

It is from this circumstance573 SCLEROTIC AND CORNJ*]A. that the antero-posterioi- diameter of the eyeball, which measures about an inch, exceeds the transverse diameter by about a line. The segment of the larger sphere, which forms about five-sixths of the globe, is opaque, and formed by the sclerotic, the tunic of protection to the eyeball; the smaller sphere, which forms the remaining sixth, is transparent, and formed by the cornea. The axes of the eyeballs are nearly parallel, and do not correspond to the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards. The optic nerves follow the direction of the axes of the orbits, and enter the eyeball a little to their inner or nasal side. The eyeball is composed of several investing tunics, and of fluid and solid refracting media, called humours. The tunics are three in number:— 1. Sclerotic and Cornea. 2. Choroid, Iris, and Ciliary Processes. 3. Retina. The refracting media, or humours, are also three:— Aqueous. Crystalline (lens) and Capsule. Vitreous. The sclerotic and cornea form the external tunic of the eyeball; they are essentially fibrous in structure, the sclerotic being opaque, and forming the poste- rior five-sixths of the globe ; the cornea, which forms the remaining sixth, being transparent. The Sclerotic (cricXrjpoc, hard) (fig. 301) has received its name from its extreme density and hardness ; it is a firm, unyielding, fibrous membrane, serving to main- 301.—A Verlical Section of the Eyeball.

The nerves are numerous, twenty or thirty in number: they are derived from the ciliary nerves, and enter the laminated sub- stances of the cornea. They ramify throughout its substance in a delicate net- work. Dissection. In order to separate the sclerotic and cornea, so as to expose the second tunic, the eyeball should be immersed iu a small vessel of water. A fold of the sclerotic near its anterior part having been pinched up, an operation not easily performed, from the extreme tension of the membrane, it should be divided with a pair of blunt-pointed scissors. As soon as the choroid is exposed, the end of a blow-pipe should be introduced into the orifice, and a stream of air forced into it, so as to separate the slight cellular connection between the sclerotic and choroid. The sclerotic should now be divided around its entire circumference, and may be removed in separate portions. The front segment being then drawn forwards, the handle of the scalpel should be pressed gently against it at its connection with the iris, and these being separated, a quantity of perfectly transparent fluid will escape ; this is the aqueous humour. In the course of the dissection, the ciliary nerves may be seen lying in the loose cellular tissue between the choroid and sclerotic, or contained in delicate grooves on jthe inner surface of the latter membrane. 302.—The Choroid and Iris.

It is pierced behind by the optic nerve, and terminates ni fi-ont at the ciliary lio-ament whore it bends inwards, and forms on its inner surface a series of folds or plaitino-s, the ciliary processes. It is thicker behind than in front. Externally, it is connected by a lino cellular web (memhrana fmca) with the inner surface of the sclerotic. Its inner surface is smooth, and lies in contact with tlie retina. The choroid is composed of three layers, external, middle, and internal. The external layer consists, in part, of the larger branches of the short ciliary arteries which run forwards between the veins before they bend downwards to terminate on the inner surface. This coat is formed, however, principally of veins which are named, from their distribution, vencB vorticosce. They converge to foilr or five equidistant trunks, which pierce the sclerotic midway between the marein of the cornea and the entrance of the optic nerve. Interspersed between the vessels are lodged dark star-shaped pigment-cells, the fibrous offsets from which communicating with similar branchmgs from neighbourmg cells, fonn a delicate network, which, towards the inner surface of the choroid, loses its pig- mentary character. The middle layer consists of an exceedingly fine capillary plexus, formed by the short cHiary vessels, and is known as the tumca liuychiana. The network is close and finer at the hinder part of the choroid than m front. About half an inch behind the cornea, its meshes become larger, and are continuous with those of the ciliary process. • j- p The inter^ial, or pigmentary layer, is a delicate membrane, consisting ot a ^5no-le layer of hexagonal nucleated cells, loaded with pigment-granules, and alued to each other, so as to resemble a tesselated pavement. Each eel contains n nucleus and is filled with grains of pigment, which are in greater abundance at the circumference of the cell.

Exteraally. they are covered with several layers of pigment-cells; the component cells are small, rounded, and full of pigment-granules. The Iris (iris, a rainbow) has received its name from its various colours in different individuals. It is a thin, circular-shaped, contractile curtain, suspended m the aqueous humour behind the cornea, and in front of the lens, being per- forated at the nasal side of its centre by a circular aperture, the pupil, for the transmission of light. By its circumference it is intimately connected with the choroid; externally to this is the ciliary ligament, by which it is connected to the sclerotic and cornea ; its inner edge forms the margin of the pupil • its sur- faces are flattened, and look forwards and backwards, the anterior surface towards the cornea, the posterior towards'the ciliary processes and lens. The anterior surface is variously coloured ha different individuals, and marked by lines which converge towai-ds the pupil. The posterior surface is of a deep purple tint, from bemg covered by dark pigment ; it is hence named uvea, from its resemblance in colour to a npe grape. pigf ent-ths composed of a fibrous stroma, muscular fibres, and The fihrous stroma consists of fine, delicate bundles of fibrous tissue, which have a circular direction at the circumference ; but the chief mass radiate towards the P P578 ORGANS OF SENSE. pupil. Thoy form, by tboii- interlacement, a delicate mesh, in wliicli tlie pigment- cells, vessels, and nerves are contained. ^ „ . 1 . J- ^- ^-i The muscular fibre is involuntary, and consists of circular and radiating fibres. The circular fibres (sphincter of the pupil) surround the margm of the pupd on the posterior surface of the iris, like a sphincter, forming a narrow band, about one thirtieth of an inch in width ; those near the free margin being closely atr^reeated ■ those more external somewhat separated, and forming less complete circles Tlie radiating fibres (dilator of the pupil) converge from the circum- ferenco towards the centre, and blend with the circular fibres near the margin of Svigment-cells are found in the stroma of the iris, and also as a distinct layer on its anterior and posterior surfaces. In the stroma, the cells are ramified, and contain yellow or brown pigment, according to the colour of the eye. On the front of the iris, there is a single layer of oval or rounded cells, with branching offsets. On the back of the iris, there are several layers of small round cells, filled with dark pigment. This layer is continuous with the pigmentary covering of the ciliary processes. ■, , . -v ■< r The arteries of the iris are derived from the long and anterior cihary, and from the vessels of the ciliary processes. , ^ ^ Membrana pupillaris. In the foetus, the pupil is closed by a delicate, transparent, vascular membrane, the membrana pupillaris, which divides the space m which the iris is suspended into two distinct chambers. This membrane contams numerous minute vessels continued from the margin of the iris to those on the front part of the capsule of the lens. These vessels have a looped arrangement, converging towards each other without anastomosing. Between the seventh and eighth month, the membrane begins to disappear, by its gradual absorption from the centre towards the circumference, and at birth only a few fragments remam. It is said sometimes to remain permanent, and produce bhndness . . • .v, f The Giliary ligament is a narrow ring of circular fibres, about one-fortieth of an inch thick, and of a whitish colour, which serves to connect the external and middle tunics of the eye. It is placed around the circumference of the iris, at its point of connection with the external layer of the choroid, the cornea and sclerotic Its component fibres are delicate, and resemble those of elastic tissue. At its point of connection with the sclerotic a minute canal is situated between the two, called the sinus circida/ris iridis. . , ^, n • i The Giliary muscle (Bowman) consists of unstriped fibres: it forms a greyish, semitransparent, circular band, about one-eighth of an inch broad, on the ou er surface of the fore part of the choroid. It is thickest m front, and gradually becomes thinner behind. Its fibres are soft, of a yellowish-white colour, longitu- dinal in direction, and arise at the point of junction of the cornea and sclerotic Passing backwards, they are attached to the choroid, m front of the retma, and coriispond by their inner surface to the plicated part of the former membrane. This muscle is admitted to be the chief agent in accommodation i e., in adjusting the eye to the vision of near objects. Mr. Bowman believed that this was effected by its compressing the vitreous body and so causing the lens to advance ; but the vfew which now prevails is that the contraction of the muscle by drawmg on the Xry processes compresses the lens, increasing the curvature of its anterior surface, and causing the iris to advance.

It is soft, and semi- transparent, in the fresh state; but soon becomes clouded, opaque, and of a pinkish tint. Exactly in the centre of the posterior part of the retina, and at a point con-esponding to the axis of the eye, in which the sense of vision is most perfect, is a round, elevated, yellowish spot, called, after its discoverer, the yellow spot or limhus luteus, of Sommerriug; having a central depression at its summit, the fovea centralis. The retina in the situation of the fovea centrahs is exceedingly thin; so much so, that the dark colour of the choroid is distinctly seen through it; so that it presents more the appearance of a foramen, and hence the name ' foramen of Sommerring' at fii-st given to it. It exists only in man, the quadrumana, and some saurian reptiles. Its use is unknown. About y^th of an inch to the inner side of the yellow spot, is the point of entrance of the optic nerve ; the arteria centralis retinoe piercing its centre. This is the only part of the surface of the retina from which the power of ^dsion is absent. 305.—The Arteria Ceatralis Eetinae, Yellow Spot, etc., the anterior Half of the Eyeball being removed. (Enlarged.) Sclerotlo Choroid Set£n» Structure. The retina is composed of three layers, together with blood-vessels '. External or columnar layer (Jacob's membrane). Middle or granular layer. Internal or nervous layer. The blood-vessels do not form a distinct layer; they ramify in the substance of tne internal layer. The external, ov JacoVs membrane, is exceedingly thin, and can be detached from the external surface of the retina by the handle of the scalpel, in the form of a flocculent film. It is thicker behind than in front, and consists of rod-like bodies of two kinds: i. Columnar rods, solid, nearly of uniform size, and arranged peirendicularly to the surface. 2.

The innermost lamina i. the thinner j its com- 1' 1' 258o ORGANS OF SENSE. ponent pnrticles are flaitoncd, looking like pieces of money seen edgeways; hence it has been called, by Bowman, the nuvimular layer. The internal or nervous layer is a thin. Bcmitranspavent membrane, consisting of an expansion of tho terminal fibres of the optic nerve and nerve-cells. The nerve-fibres are collected into bundles, wliich radiate from the point at which the trunk of the optic nerve terminates. As they proceed in a tolerably straight course towards the anterior margin of the retina, the bundles interlace, forming a delicate net, with flattened elongated meshes. The nerve-fibres which form this layer differ from tho fibres of tho optic nerve in this respect; they lose their dark outline and their tendency to become varicose ; and consist only of the central part, or axis, of the nerve-tubes. The mode of termination of the nerve-fibres is unknown. According to some observers, they terminate in loops ; according to others, in free extremities. Recent observers have stated that some of the nerve- fibres are continuous with the caudate prolongations of the nerve-cells external to the fibrous layer. The nerve-cells are placed on both sides of the fibrous layer, but chiefly upon its inner surface, and embedded within the meshes formed by the interlacing nerve-fibres; they are round or pear-shaped transparent cells, nucleated, with granular contents, furnished with caudate prolongations, some of which join the filjres of the optic nerve, whilst others are directed externally towards the granular layer. It is probable that these cells are identical with the ganglion- corpuscles of vesicular nervous substance. An extremely thin and delicate structureless membrane lines the inner surface of the retina, and separates it from the vitreous body; it is called the memlrana limitans. . •■ -.^-n • j. e The radiating fibres of the retina, described by Hemrich MuUer, consist ot extremely fine fibrillated threads, which are cDnnected externally with each of the rods of the columnar layer, of which they appear to be direct continuations, and, passino- throuo-h the entire substance of the retina, are united to the outer surface of the membrana limitans. In their course through the retina, they become con- nected with the nuclear particles of the granular layer, and give off branching processes opposite its innermost lamina; as they approach the fibrous expansion of the optic nerve, they are collected into bundles, which pass through the areola between its fibres, and are finally attached to the inner surface of the membrana limitans, where each fibre terminates in a triangular enlargement. The arteria centralis retince and its accompanying vein pierce the optic nerve, and enter the globe of the eye through the porus opticus. It immediately divides into four or five branches, which at first run between the hyaloid membrane and the nervous layer;, but they soon enter the latter membrane, and form a close capillary network in its substance. At the ora serrata, they termmate m a single vessel which bounds the terminal margin of the retina. The structure of the retina at the yellow spot presents some modifications. Jacob's membrane is thinner, and of its constituents only the cones are present; but they are small, and more closely aggregated than in any other pavt. The granular layer is absent over the fovea centralis. Of the two elements of the nervous layer, the nerve-fibres extend only to the circumference of the spot; but the nerve-cells cover its entire surface. The radiating fibres are found at the circumference, and here only extend to the inner strata of the granular layer Of the capillary vessels, the larger branches pass round the spot; but the smaller capillaries meander through it. The colour of the spot appears to imbue all the Lyer« except Jacob's membrane; it is of a rich yellow, deepest towards the centre and d^es not appear to consist of pigment-cells, but resembles more a stammg of the constituent parts. Humours of the Eye. The aqneous Immour completely fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eyeball. It is small in quantity (scarcely exceeding, according to four or five grains in weight), has an alkaline reaction, in composition is little more581 THE LENS. fcban water, less than one-fiftieth of its weight beiug solid matter, chiefly chloride of sodium. 1 1 • t , The anterior chamber is the space bounded in front by the cornea ; behmd, by the front of the iris and cihary ligament. ■ jy The posterior chamber, smaller thau the anterior, is bounded m front by the iris; behind, by the capsule of tlic lens and its suspensory ligament, and the ciliary pi'OCGSSGS In the adult, these two chambers communicate through the pupil; but in the fcetus in the seventh month, when the pupil is closed by the membrana pupil- lai'is, the two chambers are quite separate. It has been generally supposed that the two chambers are lined by a distinct membrane, the secreting membrane of the aqueous humour, analogous in strao^ ture to that of a serous sac. An epithelial covering can, however, only be found on the posterior surface of the cornea. That the two chambers do, however, secrete this fluid separately, is shown by its being found in both spaces before the removal of the membrana pupillaris. It is probable that the parts concerned in the secretion of the fluid, are the posterior surface of the cornea, both surfaces of the ii'is, and the cdiary processes. ViTEEOUs Body. The vitreous body forms about four-fifths of the entire globe. It fills the concavity of the retina, and is hollowed in front for the reception of the lens and its capsule. It is perfectly transparent, of the consistence of thin jelly, and consists of an .albuminous fluid enclosed in a delicate transpai-ent membrane, the hyaloid. This membrane invests the outer surface of the vitreous body ; it is intimately connected in front with the suspensory ligament of the lens ; and is continued into the back part of the capsule of the lens. It has been supposed, by Hannover, that from its inner surface numerous thin lamellee are prolonged inwards in a radiating manner, forming spaces in which the fluid is contained. In the adult, these lamellae cannot be detected even after careful microscopic examination; but in the fcetus a peculiar fibrous texture pervades the mass, the fibres joining at numerous points, and presenting minute nuclear granules at their point of junction. The fluid from the vitreous body resembles nearly pure water; it contains, however, some salts, and a little albumen. In the foatus, the centre of the vitreous humour presents a tubular canal, through which a minute artery passes along the vitreous body to the capsule of the lens. In the adult, no vessels penetrate its substance ; so that its nutrition must be carried on by the vessels of the retina and ciliary processes, situated upon its exterior. Crystalline Lens and its Capsule. The crystalline lens, enclosed in its capsule, is situated immediately behind the pupil, in front of the vitreous body, and surrounded by the ciUary processes, which slightly overlap its margin. The cajpstde of the lens is a transparent, highly elastic, and brittle membrane, which closely surrounds the lens. It rests, behind, in a depression in the fore part of the vitreous body : in front, it forms part of the posterior chamber of the eye ; and it IS retained in its position chiefly by the suspensory ligament of the lens' The capsule is much thicker in front than behind, structureless in texture ; and when ruptured, the edges roll up with the outer surface innermost, like the elastic ammsB of the cornea. The lens is connected to the inner surface of the capsulo by a single layer of transparent, polygonal, nucleated cells. These, after death, absorb moisture from the fluids of the eye ; and, breaking down, form the li.pior Morgagm. ° In the foetus, a small branch from the arteria centralis retinro runs forwards, as already mentioned, through the vitreous humour to the posterior part of the cap- sule of the lens, where its branches radiate and form a plexiform network, which582 ORGANS OF SENSE. covers its surface, and they are continuous round the margin of the capsule with the vessels of the ijupillary membrane, and with those of the iris. In the adult no vessels enter its substance. The le^is is si transparent, double-convex body, the convexity being greater on the posterior than on the anterior surface. It measures about a third of an inch in the transverse diameter, and about one-fourth in the antero-posterior. It con- sists of concentric layers, of which the external, in the fresh state, are soft and easily detached ; 306.—The Crystalline Lens, those beneath are firmer, the central ones forming hardened^and^divided. a hardened nucleus. These lamina) are best de- ••' monstrated by boiling, or immersion in alcohol. The same re-agents demonstrate that the lens consists of three triangular segments, the sharp edges of which ai'e directed towai-ds the centre, the bases towards the circumference. The laminse consist of minute parallel fibres, which are hexagonal prisms, the edges being dentated, and the dentations fitting accurately into each other; their breadth is about -^s^-sth. of an inch. They run from the pole on one side of the lens to the- equator on the other, so that the fibres which are longest in fi'ont are shortest behind and vice versa. There are also other fibres, which are found chiefly in the equatorial region and at the surface of the lens, which present nuclei, and are of a flattened form. Their nuclei form a layer (nuclear layer) on the surface of the lens, most distinct towards its circumference. The meridians, or lines of junction of the three segments, are formed of an amor- phous granular substance, which sometimes becomes opaque, when the lines are seen forming a distinct star on the lens. The changes produced in the lens by age, are the following:— + In the foetus, its form is nearly spherical, its colour of a slightly reddish tint, it is not perfectly transparent, and is so soft as to break down readily on the slightest pressure. . .. • • In the adult, the posterior surface is more convex than the anterior; it is colourless, transparent, and firm in texture. In old age, it becomes flattened on both surfaces, slightly opaque, of an amber tint, and increases in density. The suspensory ligament of the lens is a thin, transparent, membranous struc- ture placed between the vitreous body and the ciliary processes of the choroid; it connects the anterior margin of the retina with the anterior surface of the lens near its circumference. It assists in retaining the lens in its position. Its outer surface presents a number of folds or plaitings, in which the corresponding folds of the ciHary processes are received. These plaitings are arranged round the lens in a radiating form, and are stained by the pigment of the ciliary processes. The suspensory ligament consists of two layers, which commence behind at tlie ora serrata. The external, a tough, milky, granular membrane, covers^ the inner surface of the ciliary processes, and extends as far forwards as their anterior free extremities. The inner layer, an elastic, transparent fibro-membrauous structure, extends as far forwards as the anterior surface of the capsule of the lens nea^ its circumference. That portion of this membrane which interTenes between the ciliary processes and the capsule of the lens, forms part of the boun- darv of the posterior chamber of the eye. The posterior surface of this layer is torned towards the hyaloid membrane, being separated fi'om it at the cu-cumfcrencc r^f thp lens bv a space called the canal of Petit. , • r * Tlie cani of Petit is above one-tenth of an inch wide. It is bounded m front bv the suspensory ligament; behind, by the hyaloid membrane, its ba.e being firmed byC capsufe of the lens. When inflated with air, it is sacculated at intervals, owing to the foldings on its anterior surface.APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. 583 The Vessels of the glohe of the eye are the short, long, and anterior ciliary arteries, and the arteria centralis retinas. ^ c ,t, 1 a ^■^ The short ciliary arteries pierce the back part of the sclerotic round the entrance of the optic nerve, and divide into branches which run parallel with the axis of the eyeball: they are distributed to the middle layer of tho choroid, and to Sriro^l7'artenes, two in number, pierce the back part of the sclerotic, and run forward, between that membrane and the choroid, to the Ciliary muscle, where they each divide into an upper and lower branch; these _ anastomose and form a vascular circle round the outer circumference of the ins; from this circle branches are given off, which unite, near the margin of the pupil, in a smaller vascular circle. These branches, in their course, supply the muscular ^^'""The antenor ciliary arteries, five or six in number, axe branches of the muscular and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic. They pierce the eyeball, at the ante- rior part of the sclerotic, immediately behmd the margin of the cornea, and are distributed to the ciliary processes, some branches joining the greater vascular circle of the iris. The art&tia centralis retinae has been already described. The veins, usually four in number, are formed mainly by branches from the surface of the choroid. They perforate the sclerotic, midway between the cornea and the optic nerve, and end in the ophthalmic vein. The nerves of the eyeball, are the optic, the long ciliary nerves from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and the short ciliary nerves from the ciliary ganglion. Appendages op the Eye. The appendages of the eye (tutamina oculi), include the eyebrows, the eyelids, the conjunctiva, and the lachrymal apparatus, viz., the lachrymal gland, the lachrymal sac, and the nasal duct. The eyehroius (supercilia) are two arched eminences of integument, which sur- mount the upper circumference of the orbit on each side, and support numerous short, thick hairs, directed obliquely on the surface. In structure, the eyebrows consist of thickened integument, connected beneath with the Orbicularis palpe- brarum, Corrugator supercilii, and Occipito-frontalis muscles. These muscles serve, by their action on this part, to control to a certain extent the amount of light admitted into the eye. The eyelids (palpehrcB) are two thin, moveable folds, placed in front of the eye, protecting it from injury by their closure. The upper lid is the larger, and the more moveable of the two, and is furnished with a seperate elevator muscle, the Levator jpalpehrce svperioris. When the eyelids are opened, an elliptical space (fissiira palpehrar^im) is left between their margins, the angles of whidi correspond to the junction of the upper and lower lids, and are called canthi. The outer cantlms is more acute than the inner, and the lids here lie in close contact with the globe: but the imier canthus is prolonged for *a short distance inwards, towards the nose, and the two lids are separated by a triangular space, the lacus lachrymalis. At the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, on the margin of each eyelid, is a small conical elevation, the lachrymal papilla, or tubercle, the apex of which is pierced by a small orifice, the punctum lachrymalo, the commencement of the lachrymal canal. Structure^ of the eyelids. The eyelids are composed of the following structures, taken in their order from without inwards :— Integument, areolar tissue, fibres of the Orbicularis muscle, tarsal cartilage, fibrous membrane. Meibomian glands, and conjunctiva. The upper lid has, in. addition, the aponeurosis of the Levator palpobrsB. The integument is extremely thin, and continuous at the margin of the lids with the conjunctiva.584 ORGANS OF SENSE. The suhmtaneotis areolar tissue is veiy lax and delicate, seldom contains any fat and is extremely liable to serous infiltration. The fibres of the Orbicularis inii'^de, \v\iove thoy cover tlie palpebrse, ai-e thin, pale in colour, and possess an involuntary action. The tarsal cartilages are two thin, elongated plates of fibro-cartilage, about an inch in length. They are placed one in each lid, contributing to their form and support. The superior, the largei', is of a semilunar form, about one-third of an inch in breadth at the centre, and becoming gradually narrowed at each extremity. Into the upper border of this cartilage the aponeurosis of the Levator palpebra3 is attached. The inferior tarsal cartilage, the smaller, is thinner, and of an elliptical form. The free, or ciliary margin of the cartilages is thick, and presents a perfectly straight edge. The attached, or orbital margin, is connected to the circumference of the orbit by the fibrous membrane of the lids. The outer angle of each carti- lage is attached to the malar bone by the external palpebral or tarsal ligament. The inner angles of the two cartilages terminate at the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, being fixed to the margins of the orbit by the tendo oculi. The fibrous membrane of the lids, or tarsal ligament, is a layer of fibrous membrane, beneath the Orbiculaiis, attached, externally to the margin of the orbit, and internally to the orbital margin of the lids. It is thick and dense at the outer part of the orbit, but becomes thinner as it approaches the cartilages. This membrane serves to support the eyelids, and retains the tarsal cartilages in their position. 307.—The Meibomian Glands, etc., seen from the Inner Surfiice of the Eyelids. Xaneta The Meibomian glands (fig. 307) are situated upon the inner surface of the eyelids, between the tarsal cartilages and conjunctiva, and may be distinctly seen through the mucous membrane on everting the eyelids, presenting the appearance of parallel strings of pearls. They are about thirty in number in the upper car- tilage, and somewhat fewer in the lower. They are embedded in gi-ooves in the inner surface of the cartilages, and correspond in length with the breadth of each cartilao-c ; they are, consequently, longer in the upper than in the lower eyelid. Their "ducts open on the free margin of the lids by minute foramina, which correspond in number to the follicles. These glands are a variety of the cutaneous sebaceous glands, each consisting of a single straight tube or follicle, having a c£Ecal termination, into whicli open a number of small secondary follicles. The tubes consist of basement membrane, covered by a layer of scaly epithelium ; the cells are charged with sebaceous matter, which constitutes the secretion. The peculiar parallel arrangement of these glands side by side, forms a smooth layer,LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. 5S5 adapted fco the surface of the globe, over which they constantly glide. The use of their secretion is to prevent adhesion of the lids. The c/elashes (c/Zui) are attached to the free edges of the eyelids ; they are short, thick, curved hairs, ari-anged in a double or triple row at the margin of the lids: those of the upper hd, more numerous and longer than the lower curve upwards ; those of the lower lid curve downwards, so that they do not interlace in closing the lids. ^ ,. . r The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane of the eye. It lines the mner surface of the eyelids, and is reflected over the fore part of the sclerotic and cornea. In each of these situations, its structure presents some peculiarities. The palpebral portion of the conjunctiva is thick, opaque, highly vascular, and covered with numerous papilte, which, in the disease called granular lids, become greatly hypertropliicd. At the margin of the lids, it becomes continuous with the lining membrane of the ducts of the Meibomian glands, and through the lachrymal canals, with the lining membrane of the lachrymal sac and nasal duct. At the outer angle of the upper lip, it may be traced along the lachrymal ducts into the lachrymal gland; and at the inner angle of the eye, it forms a semilunar fold, the plica semilunaris. The folds formed by the reflection of the conjunctiva from the lids onto the eye are called the superior and inferior palpebral folds, the former being the deeper of the two. Upon the sclerotic, the conjunctiva is loosely con- nected to the globe : it becomes thinner, loses its papillary structure, is transparent, and only slightly vascular in health. Upon the cornea, the conjunctiva is ex- tremely thin and closely adherent, and no vessels can be traced into it in the adult in a healthy state. In the/ceiiis, fine capillary loops extend, for some little distance forwards, into this membrane ; but in the adult, they pass only to the circumference of the cornea. The caruncula laclirymalis is a small, reddish, conical-shaped body, situated at the inner canthus of the eye, and filling up the small triangular space in this situation, the lacus laclirymalis. It consists of a cluster of follicles similar in structure to the Meibomian, covered with mucous membrane, and is the source of the whitish secretion which constantly collects at the inner angle of the eye. A few slender hairs are attached to its surface. On the outer side of the caruncula is a slight semilunar fold of mucous membrane, the concavity of which is directed towards the cornea ; it is called the 'plica semilunaris. Between its two layers is found a thin plate of cartilage. This structure is considered to be the rudiment of the third eyelid in birds, the m.embrana nictitans. Lachetmal Apparatus/ (Fig. 308.) The lachrymal apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland, which secretes the tears, and its excretory ducts, which convey the fluid to the surface of the eye. This fluid is carried away by the lachrymal canals into the lachrymal sac, and along the nasal duct into the cavity of the nose. The laclmjmal gland is lodged in a depression at the outer angle of the orbit, on the inner side of the external angular process of the frontal bone. It is of an oval form, about the size and shape of an almond. Its upper convex surface is in contact with the periosteum of the orbit, to which it is connected by a few fibrous .bands. Its under concave surface rests upon the convexity of the eyeball, and upon the Superior and External recti muscles. Its vessels and nerves enter its posterior border, whilst its anterior margin is closely adherent to the back part of the upper eyelid, and is covered, on its inner surface, by a reflection of the con- junctiva. This margin is separated from the rest of the gland by a single depres- sion hence It is sometimes described as a separate lobe, called the palpebral portion of the gland. In structure and general appearance the lachrymal resembles the salivary glands. Its ducts, about seven in number, run obliquely beneath the mucous membrane for a short distance, and separating from each otbcr, open by a senes of mmute orifices on the upper and outer half of the conjunctiva, near itsS86 ORGANS OF SENSE. reflection on to the globe. These orifices are ai'ranged in a row, so as to disperse the secretion over the surface of tho membrane. The lachri/mal canals commence at the minute orifices, puncta lachnjmalia, seen on the margin of the lids, at the outer extremity of the lacus lachrymalis. They commence on the summit of a slightly elevated papilla, the papilla lachrymalis, and lead into minute canals, tho canalicuU, which proceed inwards to terminate in the lachrymal sac. The superior canal, the smaller and longer of the two, at first ascends, and then bonds at an acute angle, and passes inwards and downwards to the lachrymal sac. Tho inferior canal at first descends, and then abruptly changing its course, passes almost horizontally inwards. They are dense and elastic in structure, and somewhat dilated at their angle. 308.—The Lachrymal Apparatus. Right Side. The lachrymal sac is the upper dilated extremity of the nasal duct, and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lachrymal bone and nasal process of the superior maxillary. It is oval in form, its upper extremity being closed in and rounded, whilst below it is continued into the nasal duct. It is covered by the Tensor tarsi muscle and by a fibrous expansion derived from thetendo ocuh, which is attached to the ridge on the lachrymal bone. In stracture it consists of a fibrous elastic coat, lined internally by mucous membrane: the latter being continuous, through the canaliculi, with the mucous lining of the conjunctiva, and through the nasal duct with the pituitary membrane of the nose. _ _ The nasal dud is a membranous canal, about three quarters of an inch m length which extends from the lower part of the lachrymal sac to the inferior meatus of the nose, where it terminates by a somewhat expanded orifice, provided with an imperfect valve formed by the mucous membrane. It is contained m an osseous canal, formed by the superior maxillary, the lachrymal, and the inferior turbinated bones, is nan^ower in the middle than at each extremity, and takes a direction downwards, backwards, and a little outwards. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous below with the pituitary lining of the nose. In the canaliculi, this membrane is provided with scaly epithelium ; but m the lach- rymal sac and nasal duct, the epithelium is ciliated as in the nose. The Ear.

To each of those names have been assigned. Thus, the ex- ternal prominent rim of the auricle is called the helix. Another curved prominence parallel with, and in front of the helix, is called the antihelix; this bifurcates above, so as to enclose a triangular depression, the fossa of the antihelix. The narrow curved de-. pression between the helix and antihelix is called the fossa of the helix (fossa inno- minata, scaphoidea), the antihelix describes a curve round a deep, capacious cavity, the concha, which is partially divided into two parts by the commencement of the helix. In front of the concha, and project- inar backwards over the meatus, is a small pointed eminence, the tragus ; so called from its being generally covered, on its under surface, with a tuft of hair, resembling a goat's beard. Opposite the tragus, and se- parated from it by a deep notch (incisura intertragica}, is a small tubercle, the anti- tragus. Below this is the lohule, composed of tough areolar and adipose tissue, wanting the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the pinna. Structure of the pinna. The pinna is composed of a thin plate of yellow carti- lage, covered with integument, and connected to the surrounding parts by ligaments, and a few muscular fibres. The integument is thin, closely adherent to the cartilage, and furnished with sebaceous glands, which are most numerous in the concha and scaphoid fossa. The cartilage of the pinna consists of one single piece ; it gives form to this part of the ear, and upon its surface are found all the eminences and depressions above described. It does not enter into the construction of all parts of the auricle ; thus it does not form a constituent part of the lobule ; it is deficient, also, between the tragus and beginning of the helix, the notch between them being filled up by dense fibrous tissue. It presents several intervals or fissures in its substance, which partially separate the diflTerent parts. The fissure of the helix is a short, vertical slit, situated at the fore part of the pinna, immediately behind a small conical projection of cartilage, opposite the first curve of the helix (process of the helix). Another fissure, the fissure of the tragus, is seen upon the anterior surface of the tragus. The antihelix is divided below, by a deep fissure, into two parts : one part terminates by a pointed, tail-like extremity (processus caudatus) ; the other IS continuous with the antitragus. The cartilage of the pinna is very pliable, elastic, of a yellowish colour, and similar in structure to the cartilages of the nose. The ligaments of the pinna consist of two sets :—i. Those connecting it to the side ot the head. 2. Those connecting the various parts of its cartilage together. ihe termer, the most important, are two in number, anterior and posterior. The anter^or l^gament extends from the process of the helix to tlie root of tiie zygoma. The posterior ligament passes from the posterior surface of the conchaORGANS OF SENSE. 588 to the outer surface of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. A few fibi-es connect the tragus to the root of the zygoma. The ligaments connecting the various parts of the cartilage together are also two in number. Of these, one is a strong fibrous band, stretching across from the tragus to the commencement of the helix, completing the meatus in front, and partly encircling the boundary of the concha; the other extends between the concha and the jirocessus caudatus. The muscles of tho -pinna (fig. 310), like the ligaments, consist of two sets: I. Those which connect it with the side of the head, moving the pinna as a whole, viz., tho AttoUens, Attrahens, and llotrahens aurem (p. 209) ; and 2. the proper ^lo.—The Muscles of the Pinna. miiscles of the pinna, which extend from one part of the auricle to another. These are, the Helicis major. Antitragicus. Helicis minor. Transversus auriculee. Tragicus. ObHqnus auris. The Uelicis major is a narrow, vertical band of muscular fibres, situated upon the anterior margin of the helix. It arises, below, from the tubercle of the helix, and is inserted into the anterior border of the heUx, just where it is about to curve backwards. It is pretty constant in its existence. The Eelwis minor is an oblique fasciculus, attached to that part of the helix which commences from the bottom of the concha. The Tragicus is a short, flattened band of muscular fibres situated upon the outer surface of the tragus, the direction of its fibres being vertical. The ■ Antitragicus arises from the outer part of the autitragus; its fibres are in- serted into the processus caudatus of the helix. This muscle is usually very distmct. The Transversus auricula} is placed on the cranial surface of the puma. It consists of radiating fibres, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the convexity of the concha to tho prominence corresponding with the groove of the helix.AUDITORY CANAL. 589 The Odhquus aims (Todd) consists of a few fibres extending from the upper and back part of tlie concha to the convexity immediately above it The arteries of the pinna are, the posterior auricular, from the external carotid ; the anterior auricular, from the temporal; and an au^cular branch from the occi- pital artery. The veins accompany the corresponding arteries. The nerues are, the auricularis magnus, from the cervical plexus ; the posterior auricular, from the facial; the auricular branch of the pneumogastnc ; and the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The Auditory Canal (fig. 311), (meatus auditorium externus), extends irom the bottom of the concha to the membrana tympani. It is about an inch and a quarter in length, its direction is obliquely forwards and inwards, and it is slightly curved upon itself, so as to be higher in the middle than at either extremity. It forms an oval cylindrical canal, narrowest at the middle, somewhat flattened from before backwards, the greatest diameter being in the vertical direction at the external orifice ; but, in the transverse direction, at the tympanic end. The mem- brana tympani, which occupies the termination of the meatus, is obliquely directed, in consequence of the floor of the canal being longer than the roof, and the anterior wall longer than the posterior. The auditory canal is formed partially by cartilage and membrane, and partly by bone. 311.—A Front View of the Organ of Hearing. Right Side. 'Yrvtihu.lA ■CocJl/e*r. The cartilagmous portion is about half an inch in length, being rather less than half the canal ; it is formed by the cartilage of the concha and tragus, prolono-ed inwards, and firmly attached to the circumference of the auditory process The cartilage is deficient at its upper and back part, its place being supplied by fibrous membrane. This part of the canal is rendered extremely moveable by two or three deep fissures (mcisww Santorini), which extend through the cartilage in a vertical direction. ° The osseous portion is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and narrower than the cartilagmous portion. It is directed inwards and a little forwards forming a slight curve m its course, the convexity of which is upwards and backward.^ Its inner end, which commumcates with the cavity of the tympanum, is smaller tDan me outer, ana sloped, the anterior wall projecting beyond the poster ior about two lines: it is marked, except at it<4 Tir>i-,r.r. ^„ 4- i /• r. . ^ Tipper part, by a narrow groove for the insertion of the membrana tympani.

The slcm lining the meatus is very thin, adliercs closely to the cartilaginous and osseous portions of tho tube, and covers the surface of the membrana tympani, forming its outer layer. After maceration, the thin pouch of epidermis, when withdrawn, preserves the form of the meatus. The skin near its orifice is fur- nished Avith hairs and sebaceous glands. In the thick subcutaneous tissue of the cartilaginous part of the meatus are numerous ceruminous glands, which secrete the ear-wax : their ducts open on the surface of the skin. The arteries supplying the meatus are branches from the posterior auricular, internal maxillary, and temporal. The nerves are chiefly derived from the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. Middle Eak, oe Tympanum. The middle ear, or tympanum, is an irregular cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated within the petrous bone. It is placed above the jugular fossa, the carotid canal lying in front, the mastoid cells behind, the meatus audito- rius externally, and the labyrinth internally. It is filled with air, and communi- cates with the pharynx by the Eustachian tube. The tympanum is traversed by a chain of moveable bones, which connect the membrana tympani with the laby- rinth, and serve to convey the vibrations communicated to the membrana tympani across the cavity of the tympanum to the internal ear. The cavihj of the tym^oanum measures about five lines from before backwards, three lines in the vertical direction, and between two and thi-ee in the transverse, being a little broader behind and above than it is below and in front. It is bounded externally by the membrani tympani and meatus ; internally, by the outer surface of the internal ear; and communicates, behind, with the mastoid cells ; and, in front, with the Eustachian tube and canal for the Tensor tympani. Its roof and floor are formed by thin osseous laminae, which connect the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone. The roof is broad, flattened, and formed of a thin plate of bone, which separates the cranial and tympanic cavities. The floor is narrow, and corresponds to the jugular fossa, which lies beneath. The outer loall is formed by the membrana tympani, a small portion of bone being seen above and below this membrane. It presents three small apertures: the iter chordie posterius, the Glaserian fissure, and the iter chordae anterius. The aperture of the iter chordae posterius is behind the aperture for the membrana tympani, close to its margin, on a level with its centre ; it leads into a minute canal, which descends in front of the aqueeductus Eallopii, and terminates in that canal near the stylo-mastoid foramen. Through it the chorda tympani nerve enters the tympanum. The Glaserian fissure opens just above and in front of the orifice ol the mem- brana tympani; in this situation it is a mere slit, about a line in length. It gives passage to the long process of the malleus, the Laxator tympani muscle, and some tympanic vessels. , -i- £ The apertur- of the iter chordce anterius is seen just above the precedmg fissure ; it leads into a canal (canal of Huguier), which runs parallel with the Glaserian fissure. Through it the chorda tympani nerve leaves the tympanum. The internal wall of the tympanum (fig. 312) is vertical in direction, and looks directly outwards. It presents for examination the following parts :— Fenestra ovalis. Ridge of the Aquteductus Fallopii. Fenestra rotunda. Pyramid. ■ ' Promontory, Opening for the Stapedius. The fenestra ovalis is a reniform opening, leading from the tympanum into the vestibule; its long diameter is directed horizontally, and its convex border isTHE TYMPANUM. 591 4 upwards. The opening in the recent state is closed by the lining membrane common to both cavities, and is occupied by the base of the stapes. This mem- brane is placed opposite the membrana tympani, and is connected with it by the ossicula auditus. The fenestra rotunda is an oval aperture, placed at the bottom of a funnel- shaped depression, leading into the cochlea. It is situated below and rather behind 312.—View of Inner Wall of Tympanum. (Enlarged.) the fenestra ovalis, from which it is separated by a rounded elevation, the pro- montory ; it is closed in the recent state by a membrane (memhrana tympani secundaria, Scarpa). This membrane is concave towards the tympanum, convex towards the cochlea. It consists of three layers: the external, or mucous, de- rived from the mucous lining of the tympanum ; the internal, or serous, from the lining membrane of the cochlea ; and an intermediate, or fibrous layer. The promontory is a rounded hollow prominence, formed by the projection outwards of the first turn of the cochlea; it is placed between the fenestrse, and is furrowed on its surface by three small grooves, which lodge branches of the tympanic plexus. The rounded eminence of the aqticeductus Fallopii, the prominence of the bony canal m which the portio dura is contained, traverses the inner wall of the tym- panum above the fenestra ovalis, and behind that opening curves nearly vertically downwards along the posterior wall. The pyramid is a conical eminence, situated immediately behind the fenestra ovalis, and in front of the vertical portion of the eminence above described ; it is hollow in the interior, and contains the Stapedius muscle; its summit projects forwards towards the fenestra ovalis, and presents a small aperture, which trans- mits the tendon of the muscle. The cavity in the pyramid is prolonged into a mmute canal, which communicates with the aquteductus Fallopii, and transmits the nerve which supplies the Stapedius. The posterior wall of the tympanum is wider above than below, and presents for examination the Openings of the Mastoid Cells. These consist of one large irregular aperture, and several smaller openings, situated at the upper part of the posterior wall; they lead into canals, which communicate with large irregular cavities contained in the interior of the mastoid process These cavities vary considerably in number, size, and form ; they are med by mucous membrane, continuous with that covering the cavity of the tympanum. ° The anterior wall of the tympanum is wider above than below ; it corresponds592 ORGANS OF SENSE. with the carotid canal, from which it is separated by a thin plate of bono ; it presents for examination the Canal for the Tensor tympani. Orifice of the Eustachian Tube. The Processus Cochlcariformis. The orifice of the canal for the Tensor tympani, and the orifice of the Eustachian tube are situated at the ujDpcr part of the anterior wall, being separated from each other by a thin, delicate horizontal plate of bone, the processus cochlcari- formis. These canals run from the tympanum forward, inward, and a little downward, to the retiring angle between the squamous and petrous portion of the temporal bone. The canal for the Tensor tumpani is the superior and the smaller of the two ; it is rounded, and lies beneath the ujjper surface of the petrous bone, close to the hiatus Eallopii. The tympanic end of this canal forms a conical eminence, which is prolonged backwards into the cavity of the tympanum, and is perforated at its summit by an aperture, which transmits the tendon of the muscle contained in it. This emiiience is sometimes called the anterior fijramid. The canal contains the Tensor tympani muscle. The Eustachian tube is the channel through which the tympanum communicates with the pharynx. Its length is from an inch and a half to two inches, and its direction downwards, forwards, and inwards. It is formed partly of bone, partly of cartilage and fibrous tissue. The osseous portion is about half an inch in length. It commences in the lower part of the anterior wall of the tympanum, below the processus cochlcariformis, and gradually narrowing, terminates in an oval dilated opening, at the angle of junction of the petrous and squamous portions, its extremity presenting a jagged margin, which serves for the attachment of the cartilaginous portion. cartilaginous portion, about an inch in length, is formed of a triangular plate of cartilage, curled upon itself, an interval being left below, between the margins of the cartilage, which is completed by fibrous tissue. Its canal is narrow behmd, wide, expanded, and somewhat trumpet-shaped in front, terminating by an oval orifice, at the upper part and side of the pharynx, behind the back part of the inferior meatus. Through this canal the mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with that which lines the tympanum. The mucous membrane is covered with ciliated epithelium. The memlrana tympani separates the cavity of the tympanum from the bottom of the external meatus. It is a thin semi-transparent membrane, nearly oval m form, somewhat broader above than below, and directed very obliquely downwards and inwards. Its circumference is contained in a groove at the inner end of the meatus, which skirts the circumference of this part, excepting above. The handle of the malleus descends vertically between the inner and middle layers of this membrane, as far down as its centre, where it is firmly attached, drawing the membrane inwards, so that its outer surface is concave, its inner convex. Structure. This membrane is composed of three layers, an external (cuticular), a middle (fibrous), and an internal (mucous). The cuticular Iming is derived from the integument lining the meatus. Thefihrous layer consists of fibrous and elastic tissues • some of the fibres radiate from near the centre to the circumference; others are arranged, in the form of a dense circular ring, round the attached margin of the membrane. The mucous lining is derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum. The vessels pass to the membrana tympani along the handle of the malleus, and are distributed between its layers. Ossicles of the Tympanum. (Fig. 313.) The tympanum is traversed by a chain of moveable bones, three in number, the malleus, incus, and stapes. The former is attached to the membrana tympani the latter to the fenestra ovalis, the incus being placed between the two, to both of which it is counected by delicate articulations.593 OSSICLES OP THE TYMPANUM. The Mallexis, so named from its fancied resemblance to a hammer, consists of a head, neck, and three processes: the handle or manubrium, the processus gracilis, and the processus brevis. The head is the large upper extremity of the bone; it is oval in shape, and articulates posteriorly with the incus,' being free in the rest of its extent. The necic is the narrow contracted part just beneath the head; and below this is a prominence, to which the various processes are attached. The marmbri'iim is a vertical process of bone, which is connected by its outer margin with the membrana tympani. It decreases in size towards its extremity, where it is curved slightly forwards, and flattened from within outwards. The p-ocessiis gracilis is a long and very delicate process, which passes from the eminen'cG below the neck forwards and outwards to the Glaserian fissure, to which it is connected by bone and ligamentous fibres. It gives attachment to the Laxator tympani. The procesms brevis is a slight conical projection, which springs from, the root of the manubrium, and lies in contact with the membrana tympani. Its summit • .gives attachment to the Tensor tympani. The Incus has received its name from its supposed resemblance to an anvil, but it is more like a bicuspid tooth-, with two 313.—The Small Bones of the Ear, seen which differ in length,, and are widely from the Outside. (Enlarged.) separated from each other. It consists of a body and two processes. The body is somewhat quadrilateral, but compressed laterally. Its summit is deeply Concave, and articulates with th.e malleus ; in the fresh state, it is covered with cartilage and lined with synovial membrane. The two processes diverge from one an- other nearly at right angles. The short process, somewhat conical in shape, projects nearly horizontally back- wards, and is attached to the margin of the opening leading into the mastoid cells, by ligamentous fibres. The long process, longer and more slender than the preceding, descends nearly vertically behind the handle of the malleus, and bending inwards, tetminates in a rounded globular projection, the os orbiculare, or lenticular process, which is tipped with cartilage, and articulates with the head of the stapes. In the foetus the os orbiculare exists as a separate bone, but becomes united to the long process of the incus in the adult. The Stapes, so called from its close resemblance to a stirrup, consists of a head neck, two branches, and a base. ' The head presents a depression, tipped with cartUage, which articulates with the OS orbiculare. The nec7. the constricted part of the bone below the head, receives the insertion 01 the stapedius muscle.

The suspensory hgament of the malleus is a delicate, roJnd bundle of fibres QQ594 ORGANS OF SENSE. which descends perpendicularly from the roof of the tympanum to the head of the malleus. The posterior lignmenl of the incus is a short, thick, ligamentous band, -which connects the extremity of tlio short process of the incus to the posterior wall of the tympanum, near the margin of the opening of the mastoid ceUs. The annular ligament of the stapes connects the circumference of the base of this bono to the margin of the fenestra ovalis. A suspensory Ihjannent of the incus has been described by Arnold, descending from the roof of the tympanum to tho upper part of the incus, near its articulation with the malleus. The muscles of the tympanum are three :— Tensor tympani. Laxator tympani. Stapedius. The Tensor tympani, the largest, is contained in the bony canal, above the osseous portion of the' Eustachian tube, from which it is separated by the processus cochleariformis. It arises from the under surface of the petrous bone, from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube, and from the osseous canal m which it is contained. Passing backwards, it terminates in a slender tendon which is reflected outwards over the processus cochleariformis, and is inserted into the handle of the malleus, near its root. It is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion. . „ The Laxator tympani major (Sommerring) arises from the spinous process ot the sphenoid bone, and from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube, and passing backwards through the Glaserian fissure, is inserted into the neck ot the malleus, just above the processus gracilis. It is supplied by the tympanic branch of the facial. j u i <- The Laxator tympani minor (Sommerring) arises from the upper and back part of the external meatus, passes forwards and inwards between the middle and inner layers of the membrana tympani, and is inserted into the handle ot the malleus, and processus brevis. The Laxator tympani major is now ^6-7 8^-^^^^ believed to Jligamentous and not muscular, and there seems httle doubt that the structure described under the name of Laxator tympam minor is a l^g^ent. The Stapedius arises from the sides of a conical cavity hollowed out of the interior of the pyramid: its tendon emerges from the orifice at the apex of the pyrlmid, and passing forwards, is inserted into the neck of the stapes.

The veins of the tympanum terminate in the middle meningeal and pharyngeal veins and, thi-ough these, in the internal jugular. The 7ie)-ves of the tympmvum may be divided into : i. Those supplying the muscles; 2. Those distributed to the Hning membrane; 3. Branches com- municating with other nerves. Nerves to mtiscles. The Tensor tympani is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion; the Laxator tympaui, and the Stapedius, by a filament from the facial ( Sommerring). The oierves distriluted to the lining memhrane are derived from the tympanic plexus. Cmmmmications between the following nerves take place in the tympanum: the tympanic branch from the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal; a filament from the carotid plexus; a branch which joins the great suj^erficial petrosal nerve from the Vidian; and a branch to the otic ganglion (small superficial petrosal nerve). The tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal (Jacobson's nerve), enters the tympanum by an aperture in its floor, close to the inner wall, and ascends on to the promontoiy. It distributes filaments to the lining membrane of the tympanum, and divides into three bi'anches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and serve to connect this with other nerves. One branch runs in a groove, for- wards and downwards, to an aperture situated at the junction of the anterior and inner walls, just above the floor, and enters the carotid canal, to communicate with the carotid plexns of the sympathetic. The second branch is contained in a groove which runs vertically upwards to an aperture on the inner wall of the tympanum, just beneath the anterior pyramid, and in front of the fenestra ovalis. The canal leading from this opens into the hiatus Pallopii, where the nerve contained in it joins the gi-eat petrosal nerve. The third branch (small superficial petrosal) ascends towards the anterior surface of the petrous bone ; it then passes through a small aperture in the sphenoid and temporal bones to the exterior of the skull and joins the otic ganglion. As this nerve passes by the gangliform enlargement of the facial, it has a connecting filament with it. The chorda tympani quits the facial near the stylo-mastoid foramen, enters the tympanimi at the base of the pyramid, and arches forwards across its cavity between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus, to an opening mternal to the fissura Glaseri. It is invested by a reflection of the Hnino- mem- brane of the tympanum. . ° Internal Ear, or Labyrinth. The internal ear is the essential part of the organ, receiving the ultimate dis- tribution of the auditory nerve. It is called the labyrin th, from the complexity of Its shape, and consists of three parts: the vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea It IS formed by a series of cavities, channelled out of the substance of the petrous bone, communicating externally with the cavity of the tympanum through the fenestra ovalis and rotunda; and internally, with the meatus audito- rius mternus, which contains the auditory nerve. Within the osseous labyrinth is contained the membranous labyrinth, npon which the ramiBcations of the auditorv nerve are distributed. u-uuiLuiy The Vestibule (fig. 314) is the common central cavity of communication between the parts of the mterna ear. It is situated on the inner side of the tymparm behind the cochlea, and in front of the semicircular canals.

At the hinder part of the inner wall is the orifice of the aquoidudus vcdihuli, which extends to the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It transmits a small vein, and, according to some, contains a tubular prolongation of the lining membrane of the vestibule, which ends in a cul-de-sac between the layers of the dura mater within the cranial cavity. On the wpper wall or roof is a transversoly-oval depression,/o-uea semi-eZ%fica, separated from the fovea hemi- spherica by the pyramidal eminence, already mentioned. Behind, the semicircular canals open into the vestibule by five orifices. In front is a large oval opening, which communicates with the scala vestibuli of the cochlea by a single orifice, apertura scales vestibuli cocldeoi. The Semicimdar canals are three bony canals, situated above and behind the vestibule. They are of unequal length, compressed from side to side, and describe the greater part of a circle. They measure about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, and each presents a dilatation at one end, called the ampulla, which 314.—The Osseous Labyrinth laid open.

Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and outer angle of the vestibule, just above tlie fenestra ovalis; its opposite end opens by a distinct orifice at the upper and back parts of the vestibule. The Me« bears some resemblance to a common snail-shell: it forms the anterior part of the labyrinth, is conical in form, and placed almcst horizontally in front of the vestibule ; its apex is directed forwards and outwards towards the upper and front part of the inner wall of the tympanum; its base corresponds with the anterior depression at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus and is perforated by numerous apertures, for the passage of the cochlear branch ot the auditory nerve. It measures about a quarter of an inch in length, and its breadth towards the base is about the same. It consists of a conical-shaped central axis, the modiolus or columella; of a canal wound spirally round the axis for two turns and a half, from the base to the apex; and of a delicate lamina (the lamina spiralis) contained within the canal, which follows its windings, and subdivides it into two. The central axis, or modiolus, is conical in form, and extends from the base to the apex of the cochlea. Its base is broad, corresponds with the first turn of the cochlea, and is perforated by numerous orifices, which transmit filaments of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve ; the axis diminishes rapidly in size m the second coil, and terminates within the last half-coil, or cupola, in an expanded, delicate, bony lamella, which resembles the half of a funnel, divided longitudinally, and is called the infunclibidum; the broad part of this funnel is directed towards the summit of the cochlea, and blends with the last half-turn of the spiral canal of the cociilea, the cupola. At this point the two larger scalge of the cochlea, the scala tympani and scala vestibuli, communicate by an opening called the lieM- cotrema. The outer surface of the modiolus is formed of the wall of the spiral canal, and is dense in structure ; but its centre is channelled, as far as the last half- coil, by numerous branching canals, which transmit nervous filaments in regular succession into the canal of the cochlea, or on to the surface of the lamina spiralis. One of these, larger than the rest, occupies the centre of the modiolus, and is named the tubulus centralis modioli; it extends from the base to the extremity of the modiolus, and transmits a small nerve and artery (arteria centralis modioli). The sjmal caned (fig. 315) takes two turns and a half round the modiolus. It is about an inch and a half in length, measured along its outer wall; and diminishes 315-—The Cochlea laid open. (Enlarged.) gradually in size from the base to the summit, where it terminates in a cul-de-sac, the cupola, which forms the apex of the cochlea. The commencement of this canal is about the tenth of an inch in diameter : it diverges from the modiolus towards the tympanum and vestibule, and presents three openings. One, the fenestra rotunda, communicates with the tympanum : in the recent state, this aperture is closed by a membrane, the membrana tympani secundaria. Another aperture, of an oval form, enters the vestibule. *The third is the aperture of the598 ORGANS OF SENSE. aqnccductnif coclileai leading to a minute funnel-shaped canal, which opens on the basilar surface of the petrous bone, and transmits a small vein. The interior- of the spiral canal (fig. 316) is divided into three principal canals or scaler,—viz. the Scala Tympani, Scala Vcstibuh", and Scala Media, interposed between the other two. Projecting from the modiolus is a thin bony process, the lamina spiralis ossea, which consists of two thin lamellse of bone, between which 316,—Jjongitudinal Section of the Cochlea, showing the relations of the Scalas, the Ganglion Spirale, &c.

Near the point where the osseous lamina is attached to the modiolus is a small canal, denominated by Rosenthal the canalis'siiiralis modioli, and occupied by a swelling of the cochlear nerve, in which ganglion-cells are found, the ganglion spirale, from which the nerves pass to the osseous laminia and organ of Corti. The osseous kmina extends only part of the distance between the modiolus and the outer bony wall of the cochlea. Near its outer end the periosteum swells up into an elevation which is called the limhus laminm spiralis (' denticulate lamina ' of Todd and Bowman), and this terminates in a grooved border, the salcus spiralis, (fio- 317), the edges of the groove being called the lahitmi tympanicum and labium vesiihulare respectively. From the labium tympanicum a thin membrane extends over to the bony wall of the cochlea, completing the scala tympam. This mem- brane is called the memlrana basilaris. At its outer atta<;hment it swells out so as to form a thick triangular structure which was regarded as a muscle by Todd and Bowman (cochlearis), but is now recognized as Ugamentous—the ligamenUim spirale. Between the labium vestibulare and the attachment of the membrane of Reissner, presently to be described, a very deHcate membrane extends over to the outer wall of the cochlea, running nearly parallel to the membrana basilans. It w.as described by Corti, and covers over the organ which is called after his name, and is therefore called the memlrana tedoria or memhrane of Corti. Further in- wards near the commencement of the limbus laminro spiralis, another delicate membrane, the m,emhranc of Reissner, is attached to tlifi vestibular surface of the periosteum of the osseous lamina, and stretches across to the outer wall of the cochlea Tbe canal which lies below the osseous lamina and membrana ba- silaris is the scala tympani; that which is bounded by the osseous lamina and membrane of Reissner the scala yestibuli; while the space between the mem- brane of Reissner and membrana basilaris is generally described as the bcaMSCALA MEDIA. 599 media, Ganalis memhranacea, or Canalis cocJile<B, and tins is the nomenclature which >vin b; used here.

This organ (fig. 317) is situated upon the membrana basilaris, and appeai-s at first sight as a papilla, winding spirally with the turns of this membrane throughout the whole length of the cochlea, from which circumstance it has been designated the papilla spiralis. More accurately viewed, it is seen to be composed of a series of arches roofing over the zona arcuata, estimated at over 3,000 in number. The base of these arches is said to be of uniform length in the whole of the canal. The inner limb of the arch is formed by a fibre (internal fibres or rods of Corti) somewhat swollen at either extremity. In connection with the lower extremity is a nuclear body. The space between the internal rod and the grooved margin of the sulcus spiralis is occupied by cylindrical epithelium. The external limb of the arch is formed by a similar series of fibres (external fibres or rods of Corti), said to be more numerous than the internal, and the swollen upper extremities of the two rods are articulated together, the inner overlapping the outer ; the crown of the arch approaches, but does not touch, the membrana tectoria. Lying against the external rods are epithelial cells of various forms. Those described by Corti, and called after him cells of Corti, are provided with hairs or cilia. There are several rows of these, alternating with which are other epithelial cells terminating in a fine extremity above and below: these are called the cells of Deiiers; and beyond these again are the ordinary epithelial cells of the part, gradually diminishing in size. KoUiker describes a reticular lamina as covering over the cells of Corti and Deiters. This is presumed to extend from the arches of Corti to the bony wall of the cochlea, fixing the arches in their places, and is perforated by the ciha of the cells of Corti, but though its existence is undoubted, its external attachment is as yet uncertain. The exact termination of the nerves in the organ of Corti is not as yet determined, but there seems no doubt that this organ is to be regarded as the ' terminal appa- ratus of hearing,' as Henle names it.

The upper blind extremity is attached to the cupola at the upper part of the helicotreraa, the lower end fits into the angle at the commencomoiit of the osseous lamina on the floor of the vestibule. Near this blind extremity the scala media receives the ca/tialis reuniens (fig. 318), a very delicate canal, by which the ductus cochlearis is brought into continuity with the saccule. Tho inner surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by an exceedingly thin fibro-serous membrane, analogous to a periosteum, from its close adhesion to the inner surfaces of these cavities, and performing the oflBce of a serous membrane by its free surface. It linos the vestibule, and from this cavity is continued into the semicircular canals and the scala vestibuli of the cochlea, and through the heli- cotrema into the scala tympani. Two delicate tubular processes are pj'olonged along tlie aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea, to the inner surface of the dura mater. "This membrane is continued across the fenesti'a ovalis and rotunda, and consequently has no communication with the lining membrane of the tympanum. Its attached surface is rough and fibrous, and closely adherent to the bone; its free surface is smooth and -pale, covered with a layer of epithelium, and secretes a thin, limpid fluid, the aqua lahyrinthi (perilymph [Blainvillc], liquor Cotunnii). The Membrakous Labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth (fig. 318) is a closed membranous sac, containing fluid. The ramifications of the auditory nerve are distributed upon the wall of the sac. It has the same general form as the vestibule and semicircular canals in which it is enclosed; but is considerably smaller, and separated from their Hning Efiembrane by the perilymph. The vestibular portion cons^ists of two sacs, the utricle and the saccule. The utricle is the larger of the two, of an oblong form, compressed laterally, and qccupies the upper and back part of the vestibule, lying in contact with the fovea ,semi-elliptica. Numerous filaments of the auditory nerve are distributed on the 318.—The Membranous Labyrinth.

The saccule is the smaller of the two vestibular sacs ; it is globular in form, hes in the fovea hemispherica, pear the opening of the vestibular scala of the cochlea, and receives numerous nervous filaments, which enter from the bottom of the depression in which it is contained. Its cavity is apparently distinct from that of the utricle. , . j xi j- 1. p +1 The memhramous semicircular canals are .^bout one-third the diameter ot tiio osseous canals, but in number, shape, and general form they ai-e precisely similar;MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH. 6oi they are hollow, and open by five orifices into the utricle, one opening hciug common to two canals. Their ampnllte are thicker than the rest of the tubes, and nearly fill the cavities in which they are contained. The membranous labyrinth is held in its position by the numerous nervous filaments distributed to the utricle, to tho saccule, and to the ampulla of each canal. These nerves enter the vestibule through the minute apertures on its inner wall. . , Structure. The waU of the membranous labyrinth is semi-transparent, and consists of three layers. The outer layer is a loose and flocculent tissue, containing blood-vessels and numerous pigment-cells, analogous to those in the choroid. The middle layer, thicker and more transpai-ent, bears some resemblance to the hyaloid membrane, but it presents in parts marks of longitudinal fibrillation and elongated nuclei on the addition of acetic acid. The w«er layer is formed of polygonal nucleated epithelial cells, which secrete the endolymph. The endolymph (liquor Scarpa.') is a limpid, serous fluid, which fills the mem- branous labyrinth ; in composition, it closely resembles the perilymph. The otoliths are two small rounded bodies, consisting of a mass of minute crystalline grains of carbonate of lime, held together in a mesh of delicate fibrous tissue, and contained in the wall of the utricle and saccule, opposite the distribu- tion of the nerves. A calcareous material is also, according to Bowman, sparingly scattered in the cells lining the ampulla of each semicircular canal. The Arteries of the labyrinth are the internal auditory, from the basilar or superior cerebellar, the stylo-mastoid, from the posterior auricular, and, occasion- ally, branches from the occipital. The internal auditory divides at the bottom of the internal meatus into two branches, cochlear and vestibular. The cochlear branch subdivides into from twelve to fourteen twigs, which traverse the canals in the modiolus, and are distributed, in the form of a capillary network, in the substance of the lamina spiralis. The vestibular branches accompany the nerves, and are distributed, in the form of a minute capillary network, in the substance of the membranous labyrinth. The Veins (auditory) of the vestibule and semicircular canals accompany the arteries, and, receiving those of the cochlea at the base of the modiolus, terminate in the superior petrosal sinus. The Auditory nerve, the special nerve of the sense of hearing, divides, at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, into two branches, the cochlear and ves- tibular. The trunk of the nerve, as well as the branches, contains numerous ganglion-cells with caudate prolongations. The vestibular nerve, the posterior of the.two, divides into three branches, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior vestibular branch, the largest, divides into numerous filaments, which pass through minute openings at the upper and back part of the cul-de-sac at the bottom of the meatus, and entering the vestibule, are distributed to tho utricle, and to the ampulla of the external and superior semicircular canals. The middle vestibular branch consists of numerous filaments, which enter the vestibule by a smaller cluster of foramina, placed below those above-mentioned, and which correspond to the bottom of the fovea hemispherica ; they are distributed to the saccule. The inferior and smallest branch passes backwards in a canal behind the foramina for the nerves of the saccule, and is distributed to the ampulla of the pos- terior semicircular canal. The nervous filaments enter the ampuUary enlargements at a deep depression seen on their external surface, and a corresponding elevation is seen witliiu, the nerve-fibres ending m loops, and in free extremities. In the utricle and saccule, the nerve-fibres spread out, some blending with the calcareous matter, otlicrs radiat- ing on the inner surface of the wall of each cavity, becoming blended with a layer of nucleated cells, and terminating in a thin fibrous film The cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments at the base of the modiolus,602 ORGANS OF SENSE. wliich ascend along its canals, and then, bending outwards at right angles, pass between the plates of the bony lamina spiralis, close to its tympanic surface. Between the plates of the spiral lamina, the nerves form a plexus, which contains ganglion-cells ; and from tho margin of the osseous zone, branches of this plexus are distributed to tho membranous part of the septum, where they are arranged in small, conical-shaped bundles, parallel with one another. Tho filaments which supply the apical portion of tho lamina spiralis arc conducted to this part through the tubulus centralis modioli.Organs of Digestion. TiHB Apparatus for the digestion of tlae food consists of the alimentaiy canal, and of certain accessory organs. The alimcntani canal is a musculo-membranous tube, about thirty feet in length, extending from the mouth to the anus, and lined throughout its entire extent by mucous membrane. It has received different names in the various pai-ts of its course: at its commencement, the mouth, we find provision made for the mechanical division of the food (mastication), and for its admixture with a fluid secreted by the salivary glands (insalivation) ; beyond this are the organs of de- glutition, the pharynx and the oesophagus, which convey the food into that part of the alimentary canal (the stomach) in which the principal chemical changes occur ; in the stomach, the reduction and solution of the food takes place ; in the small intestines, the nutritive principles of the food (the chyle) are sepai'ated, by its admixtore with the bile and pancreatic fluid, from that portion which passes into the large intestine, most of which is expelled from the system.

It is bounded, in front, by the lips ; laterally, by the cheeks and the alveolar pro- cesses of the upper and lower jaws ; above, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongne, and by the mucous membrane stretched between the under surface of that organ and the inner surface of the jaws, and by the teeth of the lower jaw ; behind, by the soft palate and fauces.

The CuiOEKS form the sides of the face, and are continuous in front with the lips. They are composed, externally, of integument; internally, of mucous mem- brane, and between the two, of a muscular stratum, besides a largo quantity of fat, areolar tissue, vessels, nerves, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheek is rcllccted above and below upon the gums, and is continuous behind with the lining membrane of the soft palate. Opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw is a papilla, the summit of 319.—Sectional View of the Nose, Mouth, Pharynx, etc. which presents the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The principal muscle of the cheek is the Buccinator ; but numerous other muscles enter into its formation ; viz., the Zygomatici, Masseter, and Platysma myoides.

The Teeth. The human subject is provided with two sets of teeth, which make their appear- ance at different periods of life. The first set appear in childhood and are called the tmuporary, deciduous, or wdlk teeth. The second set, which also appear at an early period, continue until old age, and are named joermanent. . The temporary teeth are twenty in number ; four incisors, two canine, and four molars, in each jaw. The permanent teeth are thirty-two in number ; four incisors (two central and two lateral), two canine, four bicuspids, and six molars, in each jaw. General characters.

At the margin of the alveolus, the peri- osteum becomes continuous with the fibrous structure of the gums. Permanent Teeth. The Incisors, or cutting teeth, are so named from their presenting a sharp, cutting edge, adapted for cutting the food. They are eight in number, and form the four front teeth in each jaw.6o6 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. The crown is directed vorLically, is wedge-liko in form, being bevelled at the expense of its posterior surface, so as to terminate in a sharp, horizontal cutting edge, which, before being Kubjcct to attrition, presents three small prominent points. It is convex, eniootli, and highly polished in front; slightly concave behind, where it is frequently marked by slight longitudinal furrows. Tiio neck is constricted. The fang is long, single, conical, transversely flattened, thicker before than behind, and slightly grooved on each side in the longitudinal direction. The incisors of the upper jcm are altogether larger and stronger than those of the lower jaw. They are directed obliquely downwards and forwards. The two central ones are larger than the two lateral, and their free edges are sharp and chisel-like, being bevelled at the expense of their posterior edge : the root is more x-ounded. The incisors of the lower jmo are smaller than the upper: the two central ones ai"e smaller than the two lateral, and are the smallest of all the incisor teeth. The Canine Teeth (cusjpidaii) are four in number, two in the upper, and two in the lower jaw ; one being placed behind each lateral incisor. They are larger and stronger than the incisors, especially the root, which sinks deeply into the jaw, and causes a well-marked prominence upon its sui'face. The crown is large and conical, very convex in front, a little hollowed and uneven posteriorly, and tapering to a bluuted point, or cusp, which rises above the level of the other teeth. The root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors, conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each side. The upper canine teeth (vulgarly called eye-teeth) are larger and longer than the two lower, and situated a little behind them. The loioer canine teeth are placed in front of the upper, so that their summits correspond to the interval between the upper canine tooth and the neighbouring incisors on each side. The BicuSi'iD Teeth (small, or false molars) are eight in number, four in each jaw, two being placed immediately behind each of the canine teeth. They are smaller and shorter than the canine. The c^-own is compressed from without inwards, and surmounted by two pyra- midal eminences, or cusps, separated by a groove, hence their name, hicuspidate. The outer of these cusps is larger and more prominent than the inner. The nech is oval. The root is generally single, compressed, and presents a deep groove on each side, which indicates a tendency in the root to become double. The apex is gene- rally bifid. The upper Ucuspids are larger, and present a greater tendency to the division of their roots than the lower : this is especially marked in the second upper bicuspid. The Molar Teeth (muUicuspidati, true, or large molars) are the largest of the permanent set, and are adapted, from the great breadth of their crowns, for grind- ing and pounding the food. They are twelve in number, six in each jaw, three being placed behind each of the posterior biscuspids. The croiun is nearly cubical in form, rounded on each of its lateral surfaces, flattened in front and behind; the upper surface being surmounted by four or five tubercles, or cusps (four in the upper, five in the lower molars), sepai-ated from each other by a crucial depression, hence their name, muUicuspidati The nech is distinct, large, and rounded. The root is subdivided into from two to five fangs, each of which presents an aperture at its summit. The first molwr tooth is the largest and broadest of all: its crown has usually five cusps, three outer and two inner. In tlie upper jaw, the root consists of three fangs, widely separated from one another, two being external, the other607 TEMPORARY TEETH. internal. The latter is the largest and the longest, slightly grooved, and some- times bifid. In the lower jaw, the root consists of two fangs one being placed in front, the other behind: they are both compressed from before backwards, and grooved on their contiguous faces, indicating a tendency to division. The second vwlar is a little smaller than the first. The crown has four cusps in the upper, and five in the lower jaw The root has three fangs in the upper jaw, and two in the lower, the characters of which are similar to the preceding tooth. . ^ n -i. 1 x The third molar tooth is called the ivkdom tooth (dens saptentiCB), trom its late appeai-ance through the gum. It is smaUer than the others, and its axis is du-ected inwards. The crown is small and rounded, and furnished with three tubercles. The root is generally single, short, conical, slightly curved, and grooved so as to present traces of a subdivision into three fangs in the upper, and two in the lower jaw. Tempoeaet Teeth.

The fangs of the temporary molar teeth are smaller, and more diverging tban those of the permanent set; but, in other respects, bear a strong resemblance to them. _ Structure. On making a vertical section of a tooth (fig. 322), a hollow cavity will he found in the interior. This cavity is situated at the base of the crown, and IS continuous with a canal which traverses the centre of each fang, and opens by a mimite orifice at its extremity. The shape of the cavity corresponds some- what with that of the tooth : it forms what is called the 2^1^ caiitij, and contains a soft,- highly vascalar, and sensitive substance, the dental pulp. The pulp isORGANS OF DIGESTION. 6o8 322.—Vertical Section of a Molar Tooth. •on-n 323.—Vertical Section of a Bicus- pid Tooth. (Magnified.) ■C'TOtVA richly supplied with vessels and nerves, which enter the cavity through the small aportui-e at the point of each fang. The solid portion of tho tooth consists of throe distinct structures, viz., ivory (tooth-bone, or dentine), which forms the larger portion of the tooth ; enamel, which covers the exposed part, or crown ; and tho cortical substance, or cement (crusta petrosa), which is disposed as a thin layer on tho surface of the fang, Tho IvORV, or dentine (fig. 323), forms the principal mass of a tooth ; in its central part is the cavity enclosing tho pulp. It is a modification of the osseous tissue, from which it difiers, however, in structure and chemical com- position. On examination with the microscope, it is seen to consist of ,a number of minute wavy and branching tubes, having distinct parietes. They are called the dental iuhuli, and are embedded in a dense homogeneous substance, the intertuhular tissue. The dental tiihuli are placed parallel with one another, and open at their inner ends into the pulp cavity. They pursue a wavy and undulating course towards the periphery. The direction of these tubes varies; they are vertical in the upper portion of the crown, oblique in the neck and upper part of the root, and towards the lower part of the root they are inclined downwards. The tnbuli, at their commencement, are about an inch in diameter ; in their course they divide and subdivide dichotomously, so as to give to the cut surface of the dentine a striated appearance. Prom the sides of the tubes, especially in the fang, ramifications of extreme minuteness are given ofi", which join together in loops in the intertuhular substance, or terminate in small dilatations, from which branches are given off. Near the periphery of the dentine, the finer ramifications of the tnbuli terminate in a somewhat similar manner. In the fang these ramifications occasionally pass into the crusta petrosa. The dental tnbuli have com- paratively thick walls, and contain, according to Mr. Tomes, slender cyliudrical prolongations of the pulp-tissue. The intertuhular substance is translucent, finely granular, and contains the chief part of the earthy matter of the dentine. After the earthy matter has been removed, by steeping a tooth in weak acid, the animal basis remaining is described by Henle as consisting of bundles of pale, granular, flattened fibres, running parallel with the tubes ; but by Mr. Nasmyth as consist- ing of a mass of brick-shaped cells surrounding the tubules. By Czermak and Mr. Salter it is supposed to consist of laminae which run parallel with the pulp cavity, across the direction of the tubes. Chemical Gomposition. According to Berzelius and Bibra, dentine consists of 28 parts of animal, and 72 of earthy matter. The animal matter is resolvable by boiling into gelatin. The earthy matter consists of phosphate of Ume, carbonate of lime, a trace of fluoride of calcium, phosphate of magnesia, and other salts. The Enamel is the hardest and most compact part of a tooth, and forms a thm crust over the exposed part of the crown, as far as the commencement of the fang. It is thickest on the grinding surface of the crown, until worn away by attrition, and becomes thimier towards the neck. It consiBts of a congeries of mmuix^ hexagonal rods. They Uc parallel with one another, resting by one extremityDEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH. 609 upon tho dentine, whicli presents a number of minute depressions for their reception ; and forming the free surfixce of the crown by the other extremity. These fibres are directed vertically on the summit of the crown, horizontally at the sides ; they are about the ^^Vt; an inch in diameter, and pursue a more or less wavy course, which gives to the cut surface of the enamel the appearance of a series of concentric lines. Numerous minute interstices intervene between the enamel-fibres near their dentinal surface, a provision calculated to allow of the permeation of fluids from the dentinal tubuli into the substance of the enamel. The onameUrods consist of solid hexagonal or four-sided prisms, connected by their surfaces and ends, and filled with calcareous matter. If the latter is removed, by weak acid, from newly- formed or growing enamel, it will be found to present a network of delicate prismatic cells of animal matter. Chemical Composition. According to Bibra, enamel consists of 96-5 per cent, of earthy matter, and 3-5 per cent, of animal matter. The earthy matter consists of phosphate of lime, with traces of fluoride of calcium, carbonate of lime, phos- phate of magnesia, and other salts. The CoETiCAL Substance, or cement (crusta petrosa), is disposed as a thin layer on the roots of the teeth, from the termination of the enamel, as far as the apex of the fang, where it is usually very thick. In structure and chemical com- position, it resembles bone. It contains, sparingly, the lacunte and canaliculi which characterise true bone; the lacunge placed near the surface, have the canaliculi radiating from the side of the lacunee towards the periodontal membrane; and those more deeply placed, join with the adjacent dental tubuli. In the thicker portions of the crusta petrosa, the lamellas and Haversian canals peculiar to bone are also found. As age advances, the cement increases in thickness, and gives rise to those bony growths, or exostoses, so common in the teeth of the aged; the pulp cavity becomes also partially filled up by a hard substance, intermediate in structure between dentine and bone (osteo-dentine, Owen; secondary dentine. Tomes). It appears to be formed by a slow conversion of the dental pulp, which shrinks, or even disappears. Development of the Teeth. (Figs. 324 to 329.) According to the observations of Arnold and Goodsir, the teeth are developed from the mucous membrane covering the edges of the maxillary arches. About the sixth week of foetal life (fig. 324), the mucous membrane covering the edge of the upper jaw, presents a semicircular depression or groove : this is the primitive dental groove (Goodsir), from the floor of which the germs of the ten deciduous or milk teeth are developed. The germ of each tooth is formed by a conical elevation or papilla of mucous membrane (fig. 325) which constitutes the rudimen- tary pulp of a milk tooth. The germs of the milk teeth make their appearance in the following order: at the seventh week, the germ of the first molar of the upper jaw appears; at the eighth week, that for the canine tooth is developed; the two incisor papilljB appear about the ninth week (the central preceding the lateral) : lastly, the second molar papilla is seen at the tenth week, behind the anterior molar. The teeth of the lower jaw appear rather later, the first molar papilla being only just visible at the seventh week ; and the tenth papilla not bemg developed before the eleventh week. This completes the first or papillary stage of their development. The dental groove now becomes contracted, its margins thickened and prominent, and the groove is converted into follicles for the reception of the papillae, by the growth of membranous septa, which pass across the groove between its borders (fig. 326). The follicles by this means become the alveoli, Imed by periosteum, from the bottom of which the process of the mucous mem- brane of the gum nses, which is the germ of the future tooth. The follicle for the first molar is complete about the tenth week; the canine follows next RR6io ORGANS OF DIGESTION. succeodod by tlio follicles for the incisorK, which aro complotGd about the eloventh or twelfth week ; and, lastly, the foUiolo of the posterior molar is completed about the four- teenth week. These changes constitute the second or follicular stage. About the thirteenth week, the papiliiu begin to grow rapidly, project from the follicles, and assume a form corresponding with that of the future teeth : the follicles soon become deeper, and from their margins small membranous processes, or opei'cula, aro developed, which, meeting, unite and form a lid to the now closed cavity (fig. 327). These processes correspond in. shape to the form of the crown of the tooth, and in number to the tubercles on its surface. The follicles of the incisor teeth have two opercula, the canine thi-ee, and the molars four or five each. The follicles are thus con- verted into dental sacs, and the contained papillse become pulps. The lips of the dental groove gradually advance over the follicles from behind forwards, and, uniting, gradually ob- literate it. This completes the third or saccular stage, which takes place about the end of the fifteenth week. The deep portion of the primitive dental groove is now closed in; but the more super- ficial portion, near the surface of the gum, still remains open; it is called, by Mr. Goodsir, the secondary dental groove; from it are developed the ten anterior permanent teeth. About the fourteenth week, certain lunated depressions are formed, one behind each of the sacs of the rudimentary milk teeth. They are ten in number in each jaw, and are formed successively from before backwards; they are the rudimentary follicles of the four permanent incisors, the two canine, and the four bicuspids. As the secondary dental groove closes in, the folhcles become closed cavities of reserve (fig. 327). The cavities soon elongate and recede from the surface into the substance of the gum, behind the sacs of the deciduous teeth, and a papilla projects from the bottom of each, which is the germ of the permanent tooth; at the same time, one or more opercula are developed from the sides of the cavity; and these uniting, divide it into two portions ; the lower portion containing the papilla of the permanent tooth, the upper narrower por- tion becoming gradually contracted in the same ■way that the primitive dental groove was obliterated over the sacs of the deciduous teeth (fig. 328). , . The six posterior permanent teeth m each jaw, three on each side, arise from Development of Teeth, nc. 324. FIG. 32S. FIC. 329.

Durino- the fourth montb, that portion of the dental groove which lies behind the last temporary molar foUicle remains open, and from it is developed the papilla, the rudiment of the first permanent molar. The follicle in which it is contained, becomes closed by its operculum, and the upper part of the newly-formed sac elongates backwards to form a cavity of reserve, in which the papilla of the second permanent molar appears ah the seventh month after birth. After a con- siderable interval, during which the sacs of the first and second permanent molars have considerably increased in size, the remainder of the cavity of reserve presents for the last time a series of changes similar to the preceding, and gives rise to the sac and papilla of the wisdom-teeth, which ajjpear at the sixth year. Groiuth of the Teeth. As soon as the dental sacs are formed by the^ closing in of the follicles, they gradually enlarge, as well as their contained papillaa. Each sac consists of two layers: an internal, highly vascular layer, lined by epithelium ; and an external or areolo-fibrous membrane, analogous to the corium of the mucous membrane. The dental pulps soon become moulded to the form of the future teeth, and are adherent by their bases to the bottom of the dental sacs; in the case of the molars the base of the pulp is divided into two or more portions, which form the future fangs. Daring the fourth or fifth month of foetal life, a thin lamina or cap of den- tine is formed on the most prominent point of the pulp of all the milk teeth. In the incisor and canine teeth, this newly-formed lamina has the form of a hollow cone; in the molar teeth, as many separate laminse are found as there are eminences upon its crown. These laminte grow at the expense of the pulp-substance, increasing in breadth by a growth round their margins, and in thickness by a similar forma- tion in its substance; the separate cones (if a molar tooth) ultimately coalesce, and the crown is comjDletely formed. The pulp now becomes constricted, so as to form the cervix; and the remaining portion becomes narrow and elongated, to form the fang. The growth of dentine takes place from the surface towards the interior, until nothing but the smaU pulp-cavity remains in the centre of the tooth, com- municating by the aperture left at the point of each fang with the dental vessels and nerves. As soon as the formation of the dentine has commenced, there is developed from the inner wall of the dental sac a soft pulpy mass, the enamel organ, which is intimately united to the surface of the dental pulp, or its cap of dentine. It consists of a mesh of fibres, elastic and spongy, containing within its reticulations fluid albumen; and at the point of junction of each fibre, a transparent nucleus is visible. The surface towards the dentinal pulp is covered by a layer of elongated nucleated cells, the enamel memhram. The deposition of the enamel takes place on the outer surface of the cap of dentine. The cementum appears to be formed at a later period of life, by the periodontal membrane, extending from the margin of the enamel downwards. Eruption. When the calcification of the difi"erent tissues of the tooth is suffi- ciently advanced to enable it to bear the pressure to which it wiU be afterwards subjected, its eruption takes place, the tooth making its way throuo-h the gum The gum IS absorbed by the pressure of the crown of the tooth against it which isitself pressed up by the increasing size of the fang (fig. 328). At the same time the septa between the dental sacs, at first fibrous in structure, ossify, and constitute the alveoli; these firmly embrace the necks of the teeth, and afford them a solid basis of support. The eruption of the temporary teeth commences at the seventh month, and is complete about the end of the second year, those of the lower jaw preceding the The periods for the eruption of the temporary set are : 7th month, central incisors. r^ifl,+^ ^ <.i i.i ', ,1 , 14ta to 20th month, canine. ytti to Ioth month, lateral incisors tSUt f« o/;^-! ii, j. • i , ,, ' iin^iauis.

Previous to the permanent teeth penetrating the gum, the bony partitions which separate their sacs from the deciduous tocith are absorbed, the fangs of the temporary teeth disappear, and the permanent teeth become placed under the loose crowns of the deciduous teeth; the latter finally became detached, and the perma- nent teeth take their place in the mouth. The eruption of the permanent teeth takes place at the following periods, the teeth of the lower jaw preceding those of the upper by a short interval :— 61 years, first molars. loth year, second bicuspid. 7th year, two middle incisors. iith to 12th year, canine. 8th year, two lateral incisors. 12th to 13th year, second molars. 9th year, first bicuspid. 17th to 21st year, wisdom-teeth. The Palate. The Palate forms the roof of the mouth; it consists of two portions, the hard palate in front, the soft palate behind. The hard jjalate is bounded in front and at the sides by the alveolar arches and gums ; behind, it is continuous with the soft palate. It is covered by a dense structure, formed by the periosteum and mucous membrane of the mouth, which are intimately adherent together. Along the middle fine is a linear ridge or raphe, which terminates anteriorly in a small papilla, corresponding with the mferior openino- of the anterior palatine fossa. This papilla receives filaments from the naso-palatine and anterior palatine nerves. On either side and in front of the raphe the mucous membrane is thick, pale in colour, and corrugated; behmd, it is thin smooth, and of a deeper colour : it is covered with squamous epithehum, and furnished with numerous glands (palatal glands), which lie between the mucous membrane and the surface of the bone. ,, ^ ,-, . 3 c The soft palate (Yelim pendulum palati) is a moveable fold, suspended Irom the posterior border of the hard palate, and forming an incomplete septum between the mouth and pharynx. It consists of a fold of mucous membran^enclosmg muscular fibres, an aponeurosis, vessels, nerves, and mucous glands. When occu- pying its usual position (i.e. relaxed and pendent), its anterior surface is concave, contkiuous with the roof of the mouth, and marked by a median ridge or raphe, which indicates its original separation into two lateral halves. Its posterior surface is convex, and continuous with the mucons membrane covermg the flooi- of the posterior nares, Its upper border is attached to the posterior margm of the hard palate, and its sides are blended with the pharynx. Its lower border ^Hanging from the middle of its lower border is a small conical-shaped pendu- lous process, the ^wula; and arching outwards and downwards from the base of the uvula on each side, are two curved folds of mucous membrane, contammg rnuscn\n.v iihves, called the arches or ])iUars of the soft palate. The anterior pillar rans downwards, outwards, and forwards to the side of the base of the tongue, and is formed by the projection of the Palato-glossus muscle, ^>r>vprpd bv mucous membrane. . The posterior pillars are nearer to each other and larger than the anterior; thev run downwards, outwards, and backwards to the sides of the pharynx, and Somed by the projection of the Palato-pharyngei muscles covered by mucous membrane The anterior and posterior pillars are separated below by a triangular ^nfprval in which the tonsil is lodged. . The space left between the arches of the palate on the two sides called t^o ist1m^^s If the fauces. It is bounded above by the free margm of the palate,THE SALIVAR? GMNDS. 613 below, by the tongue; and on each side, by the pillars of the soft palate and tonsils. , T -,1 The mucous memhrane of the soft palate is thm, and covered with squamous epithelium on both surfaces, excepting near the orifice of the Eustachian tube, where it is columnar and ciliated. The palatine glands form a continuous layer on its posterior surface and round the uvula. The aponewosls of the soft palate is a thin, but firm fibrous layer, attached above to the hard palate, and becoming thinner towards the free margin of the velum. It is blended with the aponeurotic tendon of the Tensor palati muscle. The muscles of the soft palate are five on each side : the Levator palati. Tensor palati, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus, and Azygos uvuloe (see p. 231). The tonsils (amygdalce) are two glandular organs, situated one on each side of the fauces, between the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft palate. They are of a rounded form, and vary considerably in size in different individuals. Exter- nally, the tonsil is in relation with the inner surface of the Superior constrictor, and with the internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries, and corresponds to the angle of the lower jaw. Its inner surface presents from twelve to fifteen orifices, leading into small recesses, from which numerous follicles branch out into the substance of the gland. These follicles are lined by a continuation of the mucous membrane of the pharynx, covered with epithelium, their walls being formed by a layer of closed capsules embedded in the submucous tissue. These capsules are analogous to those of Peyer's glands; they contain a thick greyish secretion. The arteries supplying the tonsil are the dorsalis linguce from the lingual, the ascending palatine and tonsillar from the facial, the ascending pharyngeal from the external carotid, and the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary. The veins terminate in the tonsillar plexus, on the outer side of the tonsil. The nerves are derived from the fifth, and from the glosso-pharyngeal. The Salivary Glands. (Fig. 330.) The principal salivary glands communicating with the mouth, and pouring their secretion into its cavity, are the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual. The Parotid gland, so called from being placed near the ear (wapa near; ovq, CiTOQ, the ear), is the largest of the three salivary glands, varying in weight from half an ounce to an ounce. It lies upon the side of the face, immediately below and in front of the external ear. It is limited above by the zygoma; below, by the angle of the jaw, and by a horizontal line drawn between it and the mastoid process; anteriorly, it extends to a variable extent over the Masseter muscle; posteriorly, it is bounded by the external meatus, the mastoid process, and the Sterno-mastoid and Digastric muscles, sKghtly overlapping the former. Its anterior surface is grooved to embrace the posterior margin of the ramus of the lower jaw, and advances forwards beneath the ramus, between the two ptery- goid muscles. Its outer surface, slightly lobulated, is covered by the integument and fascia, and has one or two lymphatic glands resting on it. Its inner surface extends deeply into the neck, by means of two large processes, one of which dips behind the styloid process, and projects beneath the mastoid process and the Sterno-mastoid muscle ; the other is situated in front of the styloid process and passes into the back part of the glenoid fossa, behind the articulation of the lower jaw. Embedded in its substance is the external carotid artery, which ascends behind the ramus of the jaw; the posterior auricular artery emerges from the gland behind; the temporal artery above; the transverse facial in front; and the internal maxillary winds through it inwards, behind the neck of the jaw. Super- ficial to the external carotid is the trunk formed by the union of the temporal and internal maxillary vems; a branch, connecting this trunk with the internal juo-ular also traverses the gland. It is also traversed, from before backwards, by thefecial6i4 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. nervo and its bi-ancUcs, wliicli ciucrgc at its anterior border; the great auricular nerve pierces the gland to join the facial, and the temporal branch of the inferior maxillary norvo lies above the upper part of the gland. The internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein lie close to its deep surlace. The dud of tho parotid gland (Stono'H) is about two inches and a half in lenoth. It opens upon the inner surface of the cheek by a small orifice, opposite tho second molar tooth of tho upper jaw; and Irom tliis orifice it may be ti-aced obli(picly for a short distance beiicatli tho mucous membrane, and thence through tho substance of the Buccinator muscle, and across the Massetcr to the anterior border of tho gland, in the substance of which it commences by numerous branches. 330.—The Salivary Glands. The direction of the duct corresponds to a line drawn across the face about a finder's breadth below the zygoma, from the lower part of the concha, to midway between the free margin of the upper Hp and the ala of the nose. Whde crossmg the Masseter it receives the duct of a small detached portion of the gland, soaa varoticlis, which occasionally exists as a separate lobe, just beneath the zygomatic arch The parotid duct is dense, of considerable thickness, and its canal about the size of a crow-quill; it consists of an external or fibrous coat, of considerable density, containing contractile fibres, and of an internal or mucous coat, hned with ""^^T^sZsZidNeZ's. The arteries supplying the parotid gland are derived from the external carotid, and from the branches given off by that vessel m or near its ZlLnce T^hevems follow a similar course.

It is covered by the integument, Platysma, deep cervical fascia, and the body of the lower jaw, corresponding to a depression on the inner surface of that bone ; and lies upon the Mylo-hyoid, Hyo-glossas, Stylo-glossus nujsclos, a portion of the gW passing beneath the posterior border of the My o-hyoxd. In ftont of it is the anterior belly of the Digastric ; belaud, it is -P--ted W the parotid gland by the stylo-maxillary ligament, anc from the sublingual gland in fiont by the Mylo-hyoid muscle. The facial artery lies imbedded m a groove m its posterior and upper border. . The diid of the submaxillary gland (Wharton's) is about two inches m length, and its walls are much thinner than those of the parotid duct. It opens by a narrow orifice on the summit of a small papilla, at the side of the frsenum lino-uce Traced from thence, it is found to pass between the sublingual gland and the Genio-hyo-glossus muscle, then backwards and outwards between the Mylo-hyoid, and the Hyo-glossus and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles, and above the gustatory nerve, to the deep portion of the gland, where it commences by numerous branches. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries supplying the submaxillary gland are branches of the facial and lingual. Its veins follow the course of the arteries. The nerves are derived from the submaxillary ganglion, from the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental, and from the sympathetic. The SuUingual gland is the smallest of the salivary glands. It is situated beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, at the side of the frijenum linguas, in contact with the inner sui-face of the lower jaw, close to the symphysis. It is narrow, flattened, in shape somewhat like an almond, and weighs about a drachm. It is in relation, above, with the mucous membrane ; below, with the Mylo-hyoid muscle; m front, with the depression on the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and with its fellow of the opposite side ; behind, with the deep part of the submaxillary gland ; and internally, with the Genio-hyo-glossus, from which it is separated by the lingual nerve and Wharton's duct. Its excretory ducts (ductus Biviniani), from eight to twenty in number, "open separately into the mouth, on the elevated crest of mucous membrane, caused by the projection of the gland, on either side of the frsenum linguee. One or more join to form a tube which opens into the Whartonian duct: this is called the duct of Bartholive. Vessels and Nerves. The sublingual gland is supplied with blood from the sublingual and submental arteries. Its nerves are derived from the gustatory. Structure. The salivary are conglomerate glands, consisting of numerous lobes, which are made up of smaller lobules, connected together by dense areolar tissue, vessels, and ducts. Each lobule consists of numerous closed vesicles, which open into a common duct: the wall of each vesicle is formed of a delicate base- ment membrane, hned by epithelium, and covered on its outer surface with a dense capillary network. In the submaxillary and sublingual glands, the lobes are larger and more loosely united than in the parotid. The Phartnx, The Pharynx is that part o£ the alimentary canal which is placed behind the nose, mouth, and larynx. It is a musculo-membranous sac, somewhat conical in form, with the base upwards, and the apex downwards, extending from the under surface of the skull to the cricoid cartilage in front, and the fifth cervical vertebra behind. The pharynx is about four inches and a half in length, and broader in the transverse than in the antero-posterior diameter. Its greatest breadth is opposite the comua of the hyoid bone ; its narrowest point at its termination in the oesophagus. It is limited, above, by the basilar process of the occipital bone; belovj, it is continuous with the oesophagus ; posteriorly, it is connected by loose areolar tissue with the cervical portion of the vertebral column, and the LougiORGANS OF DIGESTION. 6i6 colli and Recti capitis antici muscles ; antenorly, it is incomplete, and is attached iu succession to the internal pterygoid plate, the ptei-ygo-maxillary ligament, the lower jaw, the tongue, liyoid bono, and larynx ; laterally, it is connected to the styloid processes and their muscles, and is in contact with the common and internal carotid arteries, the internal jugular veins, and the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves, and above, with a small part of the Internal ptei-ygoid muscles. It has seven openings communicating with it: the two posterior nares, the two Eustachian tubes, the mouth, larynx, and oesophagus. The posterior nares are the two large apertures situated at the upper part of the anterior wall of the pharynx. The feyo Eustachian tubes open one at each side of the upper part of the pharynx, ■ at the back part of the inferior meatus. Below the nasal fossas is the posterior surface of the soft palate and uvula, the large aperture of the mouth, the base of the tongue, the epiglottis, and the cordiform opening of the larynx. The oesophageal opening is the lower contracted portion of the pharynx. Struditre. The pharynx is composed of three coats : mucous, fibrous, and mus- cular. The fibrous coai is situated between the mucous and muscular layers, and is called the pharyngeal aponeurosis. It is thick above, where the muscular fibres are wanting, and is firmly connected to the basilar process of the occipital and petrous portion of the temporal bones. As it descends, it diminishes in thickness, and is gradually lost The mucous coat is continuous with that lining the Eustachian tubes, the nares, the mouth, and the larynx. It is covered by columnar ciliated epithelium, as low down as on a level with the floor of the nares; below that point, it is of the squamous variety. The muscular coat has been already described (p. 230). The pharyngeal glands are of two kinds : the simple, or compound follicular, which are found in considerable numbers beneath the mucous membrane, through- out the entire pharynx j and the racemose, which are especially numerous at the upper part of the pharynx, and form a thick layer, across the back part of the fauces, between the two Eustachian tubes. The (Esophagus. The CBsophagus is a membranous canal, about nine inches in length, extending from the pharynx to the stomach. It commences at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, opposite the first cervical vertebra, descends along the fi'ont of the spine, through the posterior mediastinum, passes through the diaphragm, and, entering the abdomen, terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach, opposite the ninth dorsal vertebi'a. The general direction of the oesophagus is vertical; but it presents two or three slight curvatures in its course. At its commence- ment, it is placed in the median line ; but it inclines to the left side as far as the root of the neck, gradually passes to the middle line again, and finally again deviates to the left, as it passes forwards to the oesophageal opening of the Dia- phragm. The oesophagus also presents an antero-posterior flexure, corresponding to the curvature of the cervical and thoracic portions of the spine. It is the narrowest part of the alimentary canal, being most contracted at its commence- ment, and at the point where it passes through the Diaphragm. Relations. In the neclc^ the oesophagus is in relation, in front, with the trachea; and, at the lower part of the neck, where it projects to the left side, with the thyi'oid gland and thoracic duct; behind, it rests upon the vertebral column and Longus colli muscle ; on each side, it is in relation with the common carotid artery (especially the left, as it inclines to that side), and part of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland ; the recurrent laryngeal nerves ascend between it and the trachea.617 TI-IE CBSOPHAGUS. In the thorax, it is at first situated a little to the left of the median hue : it then passes across the left side of the transverse part of the aortie arcl, and descends in the posterior mediastinum, aWng the right side of tl.e aorta, nearly to the Diaphragm, where it passes in fr^nt and a little to the left 0 the artery, previous to enterhig the abdomen. It is in relation, in front, with the trachea,_ the arch of the ao?ta, the left bronchus, and the posterior surface of the pericardium ; helvkid, it rests upon the vertebral column, the Longus colh, a.nd the intercostal vessels ; and below, near the Diaphragm, upon the front of the aorta ; lateraUy, it is covered by the pleurce; the vena azygos major lies on the right, and tlie descending aorta on the left side. The pueumogastric nerves descend m close contact with it, the right nerve passing down behind, and the left nerve in tront of it. Surdical Anatomy.—raiie relations of the resophagus are of considerable pvactical interest to the s\irg-eon, as he is frequently required, in cases of stricture of this tube, to dilate tlie canal by a bougie, when it becomes of importance that the direction of the oesophagus, and its relations to surrounding parts, should be remembered. In cases of malignant disease ot the oesophagus, where its tissues have become softened from infiltration of the morbid de- posit, the greatest care is requisite in directing the bougie through the strictured part, as a false passage may easily be made, and the instrument may pass into the mediastinum, or into one or the other pleural cavity, or even into the pericardium. 'I'he student should also remember that contraction of the oesophagus, and consequent symptoms of stricture, are occasionally produced by an aneurism of some part of the aorta pressing upon this tube. In such a case, the passage of a bougie could only hasten the fatal issue. It occasionally happens that a foreign body becomes impacted in the oesophagus, which can neither be brought upwards nor moved downwards. When all ordinary means for its removal have failed, excision is the only resource. This, of course, can only be performed when it is not very low down. If the I'oreigu body is allowed to remain, extensive inflam- mation and ulceration of the oesophagus may ensue. In one case with which I am acquainted, the foreign body ultimately penetrated the intervertebral substance, and destroyed life by inflammation of the membranes and substance of the cord. The operation of oesophagotomy is thus performed. The patient being placed upon his back, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated, an incision, about four inches in length, should be made on the left side of the trachea, from the thyroid cartilage downwards, dividing the skin and Platysma. The edges of the wound being separated, the Omo-hyoid muscle, and the fibres of the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, must be drawn inwards; the sheath of the carotid vessels being exposed, should be drawn outwards, and retained in that position by retractors; the oesophagus will then be exposed, and should be divided over the foreign body, which should th^ be removed. Great care is necessary to avoid wounding the thyroid vessels, the thyroid gland, and the laryngeal nerves. Structure. The oesophagus has three coats :. an external, or muscular; a middle, or cellular; and an internal, or mucous coat. The muscular coat is composed of two planes of fibres of considerable thickness, an external longitudinal, and an internal circular. The longitudinal fibres are arranged at the commencement of the tube, in three fascicuH: one in^ front, vfhich is attached to the vertical ridge on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage; and one at each side, which are continuous with the fibres of the Inferior constrictor: as they descend they blend together, and form a uniform layer, which covers the outer surface of the tube. The circular fibres are continuous above with the Inferior constrictor: their direction is transverse at the upper and lower parts of the tube, but oblique iu the central part. The muscular fibres in the upper part of the oesophagus are of a red colour, and consist chiefly of the striped variety ; but below, they consist entirely of the invo- luntaiy muscular fibre. The cellular coat connects loosely the mucous and muscular coats. The mucous coat is thick, of a reddish colour above, and pale below. It is dis- posed in longitudinal folds, which disappear on distension of the tube. Its surface IS studded with mmute papilla), and it is covered throughout with a thick layer of squamous epithelium.6i8 ORGANS OP DIGESTION. The wsophageal glands aro numerous small compound glands, scattered tlirougli- out the tube; thoy are lodged in the submucous tissue, and open upon the surface by a long excretory duct. They are most numerous at the lower part of the tube, where they form a ring round the cardiac orifice. The Aijdomen. The Abdomen is the largest cavity in the body, and is separated, below, from the pelvic cavity bythe brim of the pelvis. It is of an oval form, the extremities 331-—The Regions of tho Abdomen and their Contents. (Edge of Costal Onrtilnges in dotted outline.) of the oval being directed upwards and downwards; it is wider above than below, and measures more in the vertical than in the transverse diameter. Boundaries. It is bounded, in front and at the sides, by the lower ribs, the Transversalis muscle, and the venter ilii ; heliind, by the vertebral column, and the Psoas and Quadratus lumborum muscles ; ahove, by the Diaphragm; heloiv, by the brim of the pelvis. The muscles forming the boundaries of the cavities are lined upon their inner surface by a layer of fascia, differently arranged according to the part to -which it is attached. The abdomen contains the greater part of the alimentary canal; some of the accessory organs to digestion, viz., the liver, pancreas, and spleen ; and the kidneys and suprarenal capsules. Most of these structures, as well as the wall of the cavity in which they are contained, aro covered by an extensive and complicated serous membrane, the peritonemn.

If two parallel lines are drawn from the cartdage ol the eighth rib on each side, down to the centre of Poupart's hgament, each of these zones is subdivided into" three parts, a middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone is called the epigastric {eiri, over ; yaffr»/p, the stomach) ; and the two lateral regions, the right and left hypochondriac (hiro, under; x""Sp"', ^'^e cartilages). The central region of the middle zone is the urn- Ulical; and the two lateral regions, the right and left lumbar. The middle region of the lower zone is the hypogastric or puUc region ; and the lateral regions are the right and left inguinal.

The Peritoneum. The Peritoneum {ittpinlvtLy, to extend around) is a serous membrane ; and, like ^ all membranes of this class, a shut sac. In the female, however, it is not com- pletely closed, the Fallopian tubes communicating with it by their free extremities ; and thus the serous membrane is continuous with their mucous lining. The peritoneum partially invests all the viscera contained in the abdominal and polvio cavities, forming the visceral layer of the membrane; it is then reflectedORGANS OF DIGESTION. 620 upon the intenial surface of the parietes of those cavities, forming tlie pai-ietal layer. The free surface of the peritoneum is smooth, moist, and covered by a thin squamous epitheliiun ; its attached surface is rough, being connected to the viscera and inner surface of the pariotes by means of areolar tissue, called the suhperiionaal areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis ; but more closely to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and in the middle line of the abdomen. In order to trace the reflections of this membrane (fig. 332), the abdomen having been opened, the liver should be raised and supported in that position, and the stomach should be depressed, when a thin membranous layer is seen passing 332.—The Eeiiections of the Peritoneum, as seen in a vertical Secti(m of the Abdomen. J^atars tfiiwft/A from the transverse fissure of the liver to the upper border of the stomach : this Is the lesser or gastro-liepatic omentum. It consists of two delicate layers of peri- toneum, an anterior and a posterior, between which are continued the hepatic vessels and nerves. Of these two layers, the anterior should first be traced, and then the posterior. ^ ^ 1. j The anterior layer descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and covers its anterior surface as far as the great curvature; it descends for some distance in front of the small intestines, and, returning upon itself to the transverse colon, forms the external layer of the great omentum; it then covers the under surface of the transverse colon, and, passing to the back part of the abdonimal cavity, forms the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon. It then descends m front ot the duodenum, the aorta, and vena cava, as far as the superior mesenteric arterj- along which it passes to invest the small intestines, and, returmng to the vertebralPERITONEUM. 621 column, forms the mesentery, whilst, on either side, it covers the ascending and descending colon, and is thus continuous with the pentoneum Iming the walls of the abdonren. From the root of the mesentery, it descends along the front of he spine into the pelvis, and surrounds the upper part of the rectum, which at holds ii its position by means of a distinct fold, the mescreotum. Its course m the male and female now differs. , 1 1 j i xi „„4^ In the male, it forms a fold between the rectum and bladder, the recto- vesical fold, and ascends over the posterior surface of the latter organ as far as its summit. 11 In the/em«^e, it descends into the pelvis in front of the rectum, covers a small part of the posterior wall of the vagina, and is then reflected on to the uterus, the fundus and body of which it covers. From the sides of the uterus, it is reflected on each side to the wall of the pelvis, forming the broad ligaments ; and from the anterior surface of the uterus, it ascends upon the posterior wall of the bladder, as far as its summit. From this point it may be traced, as in the male, ascending upon the anterior parietes of the abdomen, to the under surface of the Diaphragm; from which it is reflected upon the Hver, forming the upper layer of the coronary, and the lateral and longitudinal ligaments. It then covers the u'pper and under surfaces of the liver, and at the transverse fissure becomes continuous with the anterior layer of the lesser omentum, the point whence its reflection was originally traced. The posterior layer of the lesser omentum descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and covers its posterior surface as far as the great curvature ; it then descends for some distance in front of the small intestines, and, returning upon itself to the transverse colon, forms the internal layer of the great omentum; it covers the upper surface of the transverse colon, and, passing backwards to the spine, forms the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon. Ascending in front of the pancreas and crura of the Diaphragm, it lines the back part of the under sur- face of that muscle, from which it is reflected on to the posterior border of the liver, forming the inferior layer of the coronary ligament. From the under surface of the liver it may be traced to the transverse fissure, where it is continuous with the posterior layer of the lesser omentum, the point whence its reflection was originally traced. The space included in the reflections of this layer of the peritoneum is called the lesser cavity of the peritoneum, or cavity of the great omentum. It is bounded, in. front, by the lesser omentum, the stomach, and the descending part of the great omentum; behind, by the ascending part of the great omentum, the transverse colon, transverse meso-colon, and its ascending layer; above, by the liver ; and below, by the folding of the great omentum. This space communicates with the general peritoneal cavity through the foramen of Winslow, which is situated behind the right, or free, border of the lesser omentum. The foramen of Winshw is bounded in front by the lesser omentum, enclosing the vena port« and the hepatic artery and duct; behind, by the inferior vena cava ; above, by the lobulus Spigelii; below, by the hepatic artery curving forwards from the celiac axis. This foramen is nothing more than a constriction of the general peritoneal cavity at this point, caused by the hepatic and gastric arteries passing forwards from the cseliac axis to reach their respective viscera. The viscera thus shown to be almost entirely invested by peritoneum are the Hver, stomach, spleen, first portion of the duodenum, the jejunum, and ileum, the transverse colon, sigmoid flexure, upper end of the rectum, the uterus, and ovaries. The viscera only partially invested by peritoneum are the descending and transverse portions of the duodenum, the c^cum, the ascending and descending colon, the middle portion of the rectum, and the upper part of the vagina and posterior wall of the bladder. The kidneys, suprarenal capsules, and pancreas are covered by the membrane without receiving any special investment from it.ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 622 The lower end of the rectum, the neck, base, and anterior surface of the bladder, the whole of the front, and the lower part of the posterior, wall of the vagina, have no peritoneal covoriii|T^. Numerous folds are formed by the peritoneum, extending between the various organs. Those servo to hold them in position, and, at the same time, enclose the vessels and nerves proceediug to each pai't. Some of the folds are called ligaments, from their serving to suppoi-t the organs in position. Others, which connect certain parts of the intestine witli tlie abdominal wall, constitute the mesenleries; and lastly, those aro called omenta, which proceed from the stomach to certain viscera in its neighbourhood. The Ligaments, formed by folds of the peritoneum, include those of the liver, spleen, bladder, and uterus. They will bo found described with their respective organs. The Omenta aro the lesser omentum, the great omentum, and the gastro-splenic omentum. The lesser omentum (gastro-hepatic) is the duplicature which extends between the transverse fissure of the liver, and the lesser cui'vature of the stomach. It is extremely thin, and consists, as before said, of two layers of peritoneum. At the left border, its two layers pass on to the end of the oesophagus ; but at the right border, where it is free, they are continuous, and form a free rounded margin, which contains between its layers the hepatic artery, the ductus communis choledochus, and portal vein, lymphatics and the hepatic plexus of nerves—all these structures being enclosed in loose areolar tissue, called Glisson's capsule. The great omentum (gastro-coUc) is the largest peritoneal fold. It consists of four layers of peritoneum, two of which descend from the stomach, one from its anterior, the other from its posterior surface, and, nniting at its lower border, descend in front of the small intestines, as low down as the pelvis ; they then turn upon themselves, and ascend again as far as the transverse colon, where they separate and enclose that part of the intestine. These separate layers may be easily demonstrated in the young subject; but, in the adult, they are more or less inseparably blended. The left border of the great omentum is continuous with the gastro-splenic omentum; its right border extends as far only as the duodenum. The great omentum is usually thin, presents a cribriform appearance, and always contains some adipose tissue, which, in fat subjects, accumulates in considerable quantity. Its use appears to be to protect the intestines from the cold, and to facilitate their movement upon each other during their vermicular action. The gastro-splenic omentum is the fold which connects the concave surface of the spleen to the cul-de-sac of the stomach, being continuous by its lower border wdth the great omentum. It contains the splenic vessels and vasa brevia. ■ The Mesentbeibs are, the mesentery proper, the meso-caecum, the ascendmg, transverse, and descending meso-colon, the sigmoid meso-colon, and the meso- rectum. The mesentenj {fxirrov, 'ivrspov), so called from being connected to the middle of the cylinder of the small intestine, is the broad fold of peritoneum which connects the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum with the posterior wall of the abdomen. Its root, the part connected with the vertebral column, is narrow, about six inches in length, and directed obliquely from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the°right sacro-iliao symphysis. Its intestinal border is much longer ; and here its two layers separate, so as to enclose the intestine, and form its peritoneal coat. Its breadth, between its vertebral and intestinal border, is about four niche.-. Its upper harder is continuous Avith the under surface of the transverse meso- colon ; its lower harder, with the peritoneum covering the ca3cnm and ascending colon. It serves to retain the small intestines in their position, and contains between its layers the mesenteric vessels and nerves, the lacteal vessels, and mesenteric glands. The mesa-ccectim, when it exists, serves to connect the back part ot tbc ca^cnni with the right iliac fossa; more frequently, the peritoneum passes merely in front of this portion of the largo intestine.THE STOMACH. 623 The ascending meso-colon is the fold which connects tlio back part of the asccndin- colon with the postei-ior wall of the abdomen ; and the clescondmrj mesa, colon retains the descending colon in connection with the posterior abdommal wall: more frequently, the peritoneum merely covers the anterior surface and sides of these two portions of the intestine. The transverse meso-colon is a broad fold, which connects the transverse colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is formed by the two ascending layers of the great omentum, which, after separating to surround the transverse colon join behind it, and are continued backwards to the spine, where they diverge m front of the duodenum, as already mentioned. This fold contains between its layers the vessels which supply the transverse colon. The sigmoid meso-colon is the fold of peritoneum which retains the sigmoid flexure in connection with the left iliac fossa. The meso-recimn is the narrow fold which connects the upper part of the rectum with the front of the sacrum. It contains the heemorrhoidal vessels. The a.ppendices epiploicce are small pouches of the peritoneum filled with fat, and situated along the colon and upper part of the rectum. They are chiefly appended to the transverse colon. The Stomach. The Stomach is the principal organ of digestion. It is the most dilated part of the alimentary canal, serving for the solution and reduction of the food, which constitutes the process of chymification. It is situated in tlie left hypochondriac, the epigastric, and part of the right hyprochondi'iac regions. Its form is irregularly conical, curved upon itself, and presenting a rounded base, turned to the left side. It is placed immediately behind the anterior wall of the abdomen, above the transverse colon, below the liver and the Diaphragm. Its size varies considerably in different subjects, and also according to its state of distension. When mode- rately full, its transverse diameter is about twelve inches, its vertical diameter about four. Its weight, according to Clendenning, is about four ounces and a half. It presents for examination two extremities, two orifices, two borders, and two surfaces. Its left extremity is called the greater, or splenic end. This is the largest part of the stomach, and extends two or three inches to the left of the point of entrance of the oesophagus. This expanded part is called the great cul-de-sac, or fundus. It lies behind the lower ribs, in contact with the spleen, to which it is connected by the gastro-splenic omentum. The lesser, ov pyloric end, is much smaller than the fundus, and situated on a plane anterior and inferior to it. It lies in contact with the wall of the abdomen, the under surface of the liver, and the neck of the gall-bladder. The oisophageal or cardiac orifice communicates with the oesophagus : it is the highest part of the stomach, and somewhat funnel-shaped. The pijloric orifice communicates with the duodenum, the aperture being guarded by a kind of valve—the pylorus. The lesser curvature extends between the o3sophageal and pyloric orifices, along the upper border of the organ, and is connected to the under surface of the liver by the lesser omentum. The greater curvature extends between the same two points, along the lower border, and gives attachment to the great omentum. The suifaces of the organ are limited by these two curvatures. The anterior surface is dii-ected upwards and forwards, and is in relation with the Diaphragm, the under surface of the left lobe of the liver, and with the abdommal panetes, m the epigastric region. _ The fosterior surface is directed downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the pancreas and great vessels of the abdomen, the crura of the Diaphragm, and the solar plexus.ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 624 The stomach is held in position by the lesser omentum, which extends from the transverse fissure of the liver to its lesser curvature, and by a fold of peritoneum, which ])asses from tlio Diaphragm on to the ccsophageal end of the stomach, the gastro-phrcnic ligament; this constitutes the most fixed point of the stomach. 333. The IMucous Menihrano of the Stomach and Uuodenum with the Bile Ducts. Cyttle duct whilst the pyloric end and greater curvature are the most moveable parts : hence when the stomach becomes greately distended, the greater curvature is directed forwards, whilst the anterior and posterior surfaces are directed, the former upwards, and the latter downwards. Alterations in Positions.—There is no organ in the body the position and connectioiis of which present such frequent alterations as the stomach. JJtirmff msinmtion, it is displaced downwards by the descent of the Diaphragm, and elevated by the pressure ot the abdoniiual muscles durin^' expiration. Its position in relation to the surrounding viscera is also changed, according to the empty or distended state of the organ. IVhm empty it occupies only a small part of the left hypochondriac region, the spleen lying behind it; the lelt lobe ot the Uver covers it in front, and the under surface of the heart rests upon it above, and in front; heins separated from it by the left lobe of the liver, besides the diaphragm and pericardium. This close relation between the stomach and the heart explains the fact that, in gastralgia, the pain is generally referred to the heart, and is often accompanied by palpitation and inter- mission of the pulse. When the stomach is distended the Diaphragm is forced upwards, con- tractinc the cavity of the chest; hence the dyspnoea complained of, from inspiration being imneded The heart is also displaced upwards; hence the oppression in this region, and the nalnitation experienced in extreme distension of the stomach. IW^stire from without, a CJtSh lacing, pushes the stomach down towards the pelvis. In disease, also, the pos ion and connections of the organs may be greatly changed, from the accumulation of ETn the chest or abdomen, or from alteration in size of any of the surrounding viscera.625 THE STOMACH. On looking into the pyloric end of the stomach, the mucous memhrane is found projectino- inwards in the form of a circular fold, the i)ylorus, leaving a narrow circular apertnre, about half an inch in diameter, by which the stomach communi- cates with the duodenum. The pyhrm is formed by a reduplication of the mucous membrane of the stomach, containiug numerous muscular fibres, which are aggregated mto a thick circular ring, the longitudinal fibres and serous membrane bemg continued over the fold without assisting in its formation. The aperture is occasionally oval. Sometimes, the circular fold is replaced by two crescentic folds, placed, one above, and the other below, the pyloric orifice ; and, more rarely, there is only one crescentic fold. Structure. The stomach consists of four coats : a serous, a muscular, a cellular, and a mucous coat, together with vessels and nerves. The seroihs coat is derived from the peritoneum, and covers the entire surface of the organ, excepting along the greater and lesser curvatures, at the points of attachment of the greater and lesser omenta ; here the two layers of peritoneum leave a small triangular space, along which the nutrient vessels and nerves pass. The muscular coat (fig. 334) is situated immediately beneath the serous covering. It consists of three sets of fibres : longitudinal, circular, and oblique. The longitudinal fibres are most superficial; they are continuous with the longi- tudinal fibres of the oesophagus, radiating in a stellate manner from the cardiac orifice. They are most distinct along the curvatur.es, especially the lesser; but are very thinly distributed over the surfaces. At the pyloric end, they are more thickly distributed, and continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the small intestine. The circular filrcs form a uniform layer over the whole extent of the stomach, beneath the longitudinal fibres. At the pylorus they are most abundant, and are aggregated into a circular ring, which projects into the cavity, and forms, with the fold of mucous membrane covering its surface, the pyloric valve. The oUic[ue fibres are limited chiefly to the cardiac end of the stomach, where S S626 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. they are disposed as a thick uniform layer, covering both surfaces, some passing obliquely from left to right, others from right to left, round the cai'diac orifice. - The cellular coat consists of a loose, fihuDcntous, areolar tissue, connecting the mucous and muscular layers. Ifc is sometimes called the suhniucous coat. It supports the blood-vessels previous to their distribution to the mucous membrane ; hence it is sometimes called the vascular- coat. Tke mucous menihrano of the stomach is thick; its surface smooth, soft, and velvety. During infancy, and immediately after death, it is of a pinkish tinge ; but in adult life, and in old age, it becomes of a pale straw or ash-grey colour. It is thin at the cardiac extremity, hut thicker towards the pylorus. During the contracted state of the organ, it is thrown into numerous plaits or rugsB, which, for the most part, have a longitudinal direction, and are most mai-ked towards the lesser end of the stomach, and along the greater curvature (fig. 333)- These folds are entirely obliterated when tlie organ becomes distended. Structure of the mitco'us memhmie (fig. 335). When examined with a lens, the inner surlace of the mucous membrane presents a peculiar honeycomb appearance, 335.—Minute Anatomy of Mucous Membrane of Stomach. from being covered with small shallow depressions or alveoli, of a polygonal or hexao-onaUorm, which vary from i-iooth to i-35oth of an inch in diameter, and are separated by sHghtly elevated ridges. In the bottom of the alveoh are seen the orifices of minute tubes, the gastric follicles, which are situated perpendicularly side by side in the entire substance of the mucous membrane. They are short, and sinply'tubular in character towards the cardia; but at the pyloric end, they are longer more thickly set, convoluted, and terminate in dilated saccular ex- tremitiel or are subdivided into from two to six tubular branches. The gastric follicles 'are composed of a homogenous basement membrane, hned upon its free surface by a layer of cells, which difier in theii- character in different parts of the stomach Towards the pylorus, these tubes are lined throughout with columnar epithelium • they are termed the rmocoue glands, and are supposed to secrete the gastric mucus. In other parts of the organ, the deep part of each tube is fil ed .with nuclei, and a mass of granules; above these are a mass of nucleated cells, the upper fourth of the tube being lined by columnar epithehum. These are called the pei^c rjUuds, and are the supposed agents in the secretion of the ^^^^sl^vle%Tiides are found .in greater or less number over the entire surface of the mucous membrane; they are most numerous near the py one end of the stomach, and are especially distinct in early life. ,The epithelium Immgthe mucous ^War,P of the stomach and its alveoli is of the columnar variety.

The nerves ^ve the terminal branches of the right and left pneumogastric the former being distributed upon the back, and the latter upon the front part ot the oro-an. A c^reat number of branches fi-om the sympathetic also supply the organ. The Small Intestines. The small intestine is that part of the alimentary canal in which the chyme is mixed with the bile, the pancreatic juice, and the secretions of the various glands embedded in the mucous membrane of the intestine, and where the separation of the nutritive principles of the food, the chyle, is effected: this constitutes chyli- fication. The small intestine is a convoluted tube, about twenty feet in length, which gradually diminishes in size from its commencement to its termination. It is contained in the central and lower parts of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, surrounded above and at the sides by the large intestine; in relation, in front, with the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and connected to the spine by a fold of peritoneum, the mesentery. The small intestine is divisible into three portions : the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum has received its name from being about equal in length to the breadth of twelve fingers (eight or ten inches). It is the shortest, the widest, and the most fixed part of the small intestine ; it has no mesentery, and is only partially covered by the peritoneum. Its course presents a remarkable curve, somewhat like a horseshoe in form ; the convexity being directed towards the right, and the concavity to the left, embracing the head of the pancreas. Commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely upwards and backwards to the under surface of the liver ; it then descends in front of the right kidney, and passes nearly transversely across the front of the spine, terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra. Hence the duodenum has been divided into three portions : ascending, descending, and transverse. The first, or ascending portion (fig. 336), about two inches in length, is fi-ee, moveable, and nearly completely invested by the peritoneum. It is in relation, above and in front, with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder ; behind, with the right border of the lesser omentum, the hepatic artery and duct, and vena portse. This portion of the intestine is usually found, after death, stained with bile, especially on its anterior surface. The second, or descending portion, about three inches in length, is firmly fixed by the peritoneum and pancreas. It passes from the neck of the gall-bladder vertically downwards, in front of the right kidney, as far as the third lumbar vertebra. It is covered by peritoneum only on its anterior surface. It is in relation, in front, with the right arch of the colon and the meso-colon; behind, with the front of the right kidney ; at its inner side is the head of the pancreas' and the ductus communis choledochus. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct perforate the mner side of this portion of the intestine obliquely, a little below its middle. The third, or transverse portion, the longest and narrowest part of the duo- denum, passes across the front of the spine, ascending from the third to the second lumbar vertebra, and terminating in the jejunum on the left side of that bone. In front, it is covered by the descending layer of the transverse meso- colon, and crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels; behind, it rests upon the aorta, the vena cava, and the crura of the Diaphragm; above it, is the lower border ot the pancreas, the superior mesenteric vessels passing forwards between the two. ° s s 2628 ORGANS OF DIGESTION.

The longitudinal fibres are thinly scattered over the surface of the intestine, and are most distinct along its free border. The circidar fibres form a thick, uniform layer ; they surround the cylinder ot the intestine in the greater part of its circumference, but do not form complete rings. The muscular coat is thicker at the upper than at the lower part ot the small intestine. The cellular, or suhmiocous coat, connects together the mucous and muscular layers. It consists of a loose, filamentous, areolar tissue, which forms a nidus for the subdivision of the nutrient vessels, previous to their distribution to the mucous surface. The mucous membrane is thick and highly vascular at the upper part of the small intestine, but somewhat paler and thinner below. It presents for exami- nation the following constituents :— Epithelium. Simple follicles. Valvulee conniventes. f Duodenal glands. Villi. Glands. < Solitary glands. L Agminate or Peyer's glands. The epithelium, covering the mucous membrane of the small intestine, is of the columnar variety. The valvulce conniventes (valves of Kerkring) are reduplications or foldings of the mucous membrane and submucous tissue, containing no muscular fibres. They extend transversely across the cylinder of the intestine for about three- fourths or five-sixths of its circumference. The larger folds are about two inches in length, and two-thirds of an inch in depth at their broadest part; but the greater number are of smaller size. The larger and smaller folds alternate with each other. They are not found at the commencement of the duodenum, but begin to appear about one or two inches beyond the pylorus. In the lower part of the descending portion, below the point where the common choledic and pancreatic ducts enter the intestine, they are very large and closely approximated. In the transverse portion of the duodenum and upper half of the jejunum, they are large and numerous; and from this point, down to the middle of the ileum, they dimi- nish couvsiderably in size. In the lower part of the ileum, they almost entirely disappear; hence the compai'ative thinness of this portion of the intestine, as compared with the duodenum and jejunum. The valvulos conniventes retard the passage of the food along the intestines, and afford a more extensive surface for absorption. The villi are minute, highly vascular processes, projecting from the mucous membrane of the small intestine throughout its whole extent, and giving to its surface a velvety appearance. In shape, some are triangular and laminated, others conical or cylindrical, with clubbed or filiform extremities. They are largest and most numerous in the duodenum and jejunum, and become fewer and smaller in the ileum. Krause estimates their number in the upper part of the small intestine at from fifty to ninety in a square line ; and in the lower part from forty to seventy ; the total number for the whole length of the intestine being about four millions. In structure each villus consists of a network of capillary and lacteal vessels,630 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 337.—^Two Villi magnified. JB/iiHitJial -.AfUry with nuclear corpuscles and fat globules in their interstices, enclosed in a thin prolongation of basement membrane covered by a single layer of columnar epi- thelium, the particles of which are arranged perpendicular to the surface. A layer of organic muscular fibre has been described forming a thin hollow cone round the central lacteal. It is possible that this assists in the propulsion of the chyle along the vessel. The mode of origin of the lacteals within the villi is unknown. Tho simi.de follicles, or crypts of Lieber- kiihn, are found in considerable numbers over every part of the mucous membrane of the small intestine. They consist of minute tubular depressions of the mucous membrane, arranged perpendicularly to the surface, upon which they open by small circular apertures. They may be seen with the aid of a lens, their orifices appearing as minute dots, scattered between the vilh. Their walls are thin, consisting of a layer of basement membrane, lined by cylindrical epithelium, and covered on their exterior by capillaiy vessels. Their contents vary, even in health, and the purpose served by their secretion is still very doubtful. The duodenal, or Brunner's glands, are limited to the duodenum and com- mencement of the jejunum. They are small, flattened, granular bodies, imbedded in the submucous areolar tissue, and open upon the surface of the mucous mem- brane by minute excretory ducts. They are most numerous and largest near the pylorus They may be compared to the elementary lobules of a salivary gland spread out over a broad surface, instead of being coUected in a mass. In structure they resemble the pancreas. i. . ,i The solitary glands (glandules solitarim) are found scattered throughout the mucous membrane of the small intestine, but are most numerous m the lower part of the ileum. They are smaU, round, whitish bodies, from half a Ime to a line in diameter, consisting of a closed saccular cavity, having no excretory duct, and containing an opaque white secretion. Their free surface is covered with viUi, and each gland is surrounded by openings like those of the foUicles ot Lieberkiihn. Their use is not known. _ Fever's glands (figs. 338-9) maybe regarded as aggregations of sohtaiy glands, forming circular or oval patches from twenty to thirty in number, and varpng m length from half an inch to four inches. They are largest and most numerous m the ileum. In the lower part of the jejunum they are small, of a circular form and few in number. They are occasionally seen in the duodenum. They are placed lengthwise in the intestine, covering the portion of the tube most distant from the attachment of the mesentery. Each patch is formed of a group of small, round, whitish vesicles, covered with mucous membrane. Each vesicle consists of a mode- rately thick external capsule, having no excretory duct, and containing an opaque ^hite secretion. Each is surrounded by a zone, or wreath o£ simple folhcles, and the interspaces between them are covered with vilh. These vesicles are usually closed • but it is supposed they open at intervals to discharge the secre ion contained within them. The mucous and submucous coats of the mtest.ne are intimately adherent, and highly vascular, opposite the Peyerian glands. Their use is not known. They are largest and most developed durmg the diges- tive process.LARGE INTESTINE. The Large Intestine. 1 r +cTmiTi!ition of tlio ileum to the amis.

Aw canal It is largest at its commencement at the csecum, and gradually diminishes as far as the rectum, where there is a dilatation of considerable size, just above the anus. It differs from the small intestine in. its greater size, its more fixed position, and its sacculated form. The large intestine, in its course, describes an arch which surrounds the convolutions of the small intestine. It commences m the rio-ht iliac fossa, in a dilated part, the C£BCum. It ascends through the right lumbar and hypochondriac regions to the tinder surface of the liver; passes transversely across the abdomen, on the confines of the epigastric and umbiUcal regions, to the left hypochondriac region ; descends through the left lumbar region to the left ihac fossa, where it becomes convoluted, and forms the sigmoid flexure ; finally, it enters the pelvis, and descends along its posterior wall to the anus. The large intestine is divided into the caecum, colon, and rectum. The^Gmcum (ccecus, blind) (fig. 340) is the large blind porch, or cul-de-sac, in which the large intestine commences. It is the most dilated part of the tube, measuring about two and a half inches, both in its vertical and transverse diameters. It is situated in the right iliac fossa, immediately behind the anterior abdominal wall, being retained in its place by the peritoneum, which passes over its anterior surface and sides; its posterior surface being connected by loose areolar tissue with the iliac fascia. Occasionally, it is almost completely surrounded by peri- toneum, which forms a distinct fold, the meso-C£ecum, connecting its back part with the iliac fossa. When this fold exists the caecum obtains considerable freedom of movement. Attached to its lower and back part is the appendix vermiformis, a long, narrow, worm-shaped tube, the rudiment of the lengtheiied caecum found in all the mammalia, except the ourang-outang and wombat. The appendix varies from three to six inches in length, its average diameter being about equal to that of a goose-quill. It is usually directed upwards and inwards behind the ciEcum, coiled upon itself, and terminates in a blunt point, being retained in its position by a fold of peritoneum, which sometimes forms a mesentery for it. Its canal is small, and communicates with the cajcum by an orifice, which is some- times guarded with an incomplete valve. Its coats are thick, and its mucous lining furnished with a large number of solitary glands. Ileo-Co'cal Valve. The lower end of the ileum tei-minates at the inner and back part of the large intestine, opposite the junction of the co&cum with the632 OiiGANrf OF DlGJ!:STiON. colon. At tliis point tho mucous membrane forms two valvular folds, whicli project into the large intestine, and are separated from each other by a naiTow elongated aperture. This is tho ileo-cojcal valve (valvula Bauhmi). Bach fold ia Bomilunai- in form. The upper one, nearly horizontal in direction, is attached by its convex border to the point of junction of the ileum with the colon ; the lower segment, to the point of junction of the ileum with the cjECum. Their free concave margins project into the intestine, separated from one another by a narrow slit-like aperture, directed transversely. At each end of this aperture the two segments of the valve coalesce, and are continued as a narrow membranous ridge, around the canal of the intestine for a short distance, forming the frcena, or retinacula of the valve. The left end of this aperture is rounded: the right end is narrow and pointed. Each segment of the valve is formed by a reduplication of the mucous mem- brane, and of the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, the longitudinal fibres and peritoneum being continued uninterruptedly across from one intestine to the other. When these are divided or removed, the ileum may be drawn outwards, and all traces of the valve will be lost, the ileum appearing to open into the large intestine by a funnel-shaped orifice of large size. The surface of each segment of the valve directed towards the ileum is covered with villi, and presents the characteristic structure of the mucous membrane of the small intestine ; whilst that turned towards the large intestine is destitute of villi, and marked with the orifices of the numerous tubuli peculiar to the mem- brane in the large intestine. These difierences in structure continue as far as the free margin of the valve. When the creeum is distended, the margins of the opening are approximated, so as to prevent any reflux into the ileum. The colon is divided into four parts : the ascending, transverse, descending, and the sigmoid flexure. The ascending colon is smaller than the co3cnm. It passes upwards, trom tlie right iliac fossa to tho under surface of the liver, on the right of the gall-bladder.633 LARGE INTESTINE. where it beads abruptly inwards to the left, formmg the hepatic jlexure. It is retained in contact with the posterior wall of the abdomen by the peritoneam, which covers its anterior surftxce and sides, its posterior surface bemgconnected by loose areolar tissue with the Quadratus lumborum and right kidney, Figs 341, 342 ; sometimes the peritoneum almost completely invests it, and forms a distinct but narrow meso-colon. It is in relation, in front, with the convolutions of the ilenm and the abdominal parietes; behind, it lies on the Quadratus lumborum muscle, and right kidney. 341 —Diaoram of the relations of the Large Intestine and Kidney from behind, °The parts uncovered by Peritoneum are 'shown unshaded. The transverse colon, the longest part of the large intestine, passes transversely from right to left across the abdomen, opposite the confines of the epigastric and umbilical zones, into the left hypochondriac region, where it curves downwards beneath the lower end of the spleen, forming the splenic flexure. In its conrse it describes an arch, the concavity of which is directed backwards towards the ver- tebral column; hence the name, transverse arch of the colon. This is the most moveable part of the colon, being almost completely invested by peritoneum, and connected to the spine behind by a large and wide duplicatnre of that membrane, the transverse meso-colon. It is in relation, by its npper surface, with the liver and gall-bladder, the great curvature of the stomach, and the lower end of the spleen; by its under surface, with the small intestines; by its anterior surface, with the anterior layers of the great omentum and the abdominal parietes; by its posterior surface, with the transverse meso-colon. The descending colon passes almost vertically downwards through the left hypo- chondriac and lumbar regions to the upper part of the left iliac fossa, where it terminates in the sigmoid flexure. It is retained in position by the peritoneum, which covers its anterior surface and sides, its posterior surface being connected by areolar tissue with the left crus of the Diaphragm, tho left kidney, and the Quadratus lumborum. Figs 341, 342. It is smaller in calibre and more deeply placed than the ascending colon.634 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. The sigmoid jlexwe is the narrowest part of the colon ; it is situated in the left iliac fossa, commoncing from the termination of the descending colon, at the margin of the crest of the ilium, and ending in the rectum, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis. It curves in the lii'st place upwards, and then descends vertically, and to one or the other side, like the letter S—hence its name. It is retained in its place by a loose fold of peritoneum, the sigmoid meso-colon. It is in relation, in front, with the small intestines and abdominal parietes; behind, with the iliac fossa. 342.—The relations of the Viscera and Large Vessels of the Abdomen. (Seen from behind.) RECEPTACUUUM .CHYLI The Bedimo is the terminal part of the large intestine, and extends from the sio-moid flexure to the anus ; it varies in length from six to eiglit inches, and has received its name from being less flexuous than any other part of the intestinal canal It commences opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis, passes obliquely downwards from left to right to the middle of the sacrum, formmg a gentle curve to the right side ; then, regaining the middle line, it descends in front of the lower part of the sacrum and coccyx, and, near the extremity of the latter bone inclines backwards to terminate at the anus, being curved both m the lateral and intero-posterior directions. The rectum is, therefore, not straight, the upper part being directed obliquely from the left side to the median Ime, the middle portion being curved in the direction of the hollow of the sacrum and coccyx, and the lower portion presenting a short curve in the opposite direction. The rectum is cylindrical, not sacculated like the rest of the large intestine ; it is narrower at its upper part than the sigmoid flexure, gradually increases in size as it descends and immediately above the anus presents a considerable dilatation, capable ot acquiring an enormous size. The rectum is divided into three portions : upper, middle, and lower.635 LARGE INTESTINE. The upper portion, which includes about half the length of the tube, extends obliqxxely from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the middle of the third piece of he sacium.^ It is almost completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected to the a rum behind by a dupUcature of that membrane the --J-^J- ^^ i^ - relation behind with the Pyi-iformis muscle, the sacral p exus of nerves and the Wches of the internal ilfac artery of the left side, which separate it from h sacrum and sacro-iliac symphysis; in front it is separated, m the male from he posterior surface of the bladder: in the female, from the posterior surface of the Uterus, and its appendages, by some convolutions of the small i^^^^J^^^- The middle portion of the rectum is about three mches m length, and extends as far as the tip of the coccyx.

In the female, it is adlierent to the posterior wall of the vagina. < ,i r The lou-er portion is about an inch in length ; it curves backwards at the tore part of the prostate gland, and terminates at the anus. This portion of the intestine receives no peritoneal covering. It is invested by the Internal sphincter, supported by the Lavatores ani muscles, and surrounded at its termination by the External sphincter. In the male, it is separated from the membranons portion and bulb of the urethra by a triangular space ; and, in the female, a similar space intervenes between it and the vagina. This space forms by its base the perinaeum. Stnicture. The large intestine has four coats: serous, muscular, cellular, and mucous. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum, and invests the different portions of the large intestine to a variable extent. The caecum is covered only on its anterior surface and sides ; more rarely, it is almost completely invested, being held in its position by a duplicature, the meso-CEecum. The ascending and descending colon are usually covered only in front. The transverse colon is almost completely invested, the parts corresponding to the attachment of the great omentum and transverse meso-colon being alone excepted. The sigmoid flexure is nearly com- pletely surrounded, the point corresponding to the attachment of the sigmoid meso- colon being excepted. The upper part of the rectum is almost completely invested by the peritoneum: the middle portion is covered only on its anterior surface ; and the lower portion is entirely devoid of any serous covering. In the course of the colon, and upper part of the rectum, the peritoneal coat is thrown into a number of small pouches filled with fat, called appendices epiploicoB. They are chiefly appended to the transverse colon. The muscidar coat consists of an external longitudinal and an internal circular layer of muscular fibres. The longitudinal fibres are not found as a uniform layer over the whole surface of the large intestine. In the CEPCum and colon, they are especially collected in to three flat longitu.dinal bands, each being about half an inch in width. These bands commence at the attachment of the appendix vermiformis to the caecum : one, the posterior, is placed along the attached border of the intestine ; the anterior band, the largest, becomes inferior along the arch of the colon, where it corresponds to the attachment of the great omentum, but is in front in the ascending and descending colon and sigmoid iexure; the third, or lateral band, is found on the inner side of the ascending and descending colon, and on the under border of the ..transverse colon. These bands are nearly one-half shorter than the other parts of the intestine, and serve to produce the sacculi which are characteristic of the caecum and colon; accordingly, when they are dissected ofl^, the tube can be lengthened, and its sacculated character becomes lost. In the sigmoid flexure, the longitudinal fibres become more scattered, but upon its lower part, and rousd the rectum, they spread out, and form a thick uniform layer. The cii-ctdar fibres form a thin layer, over the caecum and colon, being especiallyORGANS OF DIGESTION. 636 accumulated in the intervals between the Bacculi; in the rectum, they fo^-m a thick layer, especially at its lower end, where they become numerous, and form the Internal sphincter. The cellular coat connects the muscular and mucous layers closely together. The mucotis membrane, in the ccccum and colon, is pale, and of a greyish or pale yellow colour. It is quite smooth, destitute of villi, and raised into numerous crescentic folds, which corrosjjond to the intervals between the sacculi. In the rectum, it is thicker, of a darker colour, more vascular, and connected loosely to the muscular coat as in the oesophagus. When the lower part of the rectum is contracted, its mucous membrane is thrown into a number of folds, some of which, near the anus, are longitudinal in direction, and are effaced by the disten- sion of the gut. Besides these, there are certain permanent folds, of a semilunar shape, described by Mr. Houston.* They are usually three in number ; sometimes a fourth is found, and, occasionally, only two are present. One is situated near the commencement of the rectum, on the right side ; another extends inwards from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum ; the largest and most constant one projects backwards from the fore part of the rectum, opposite the base of the bladder. When a fourth is present, it is situated about an inch above the anus on the back of the rectum. These folds are about half an inch in width, and contain some of the circular fibres of the gut. In the empty state of the intestine they overlap each other, as Mr. Houston remarks, so effectually as to require considerable manoeuvring to conduct a bougie or the finger along the canal of the intestine. Their use seems to be, ' to support the weight of fascal matter, and pi-event its urging towards the anus, where its presence always excites a sensation demanding its discharge.' The mucous membrane of the large intestine presents for examination, epithelium, simple follicles, and solitary glands. 343.—Minute Structure of Large Intestine. itb Siilitary Gland. The epithelium is of the columnar kind. The simple folliclee are minute tubular prolongations of the mucous membmnc, arranged perpendicularly, side by side, over its entire surface; tliey are longer, more numerous, and placed in much closer apposition than those of the small intestine ; and they open by minute rounded orifices upon the surface, giving it a cribriform appearance. The solitary glands in the large intestine are most abundant in the cajcum appendix vermiformis; but are irregularly scattered also over the rest of the intestine. They are small, prominent, flask-shaped bodies, of a whitish colour, and present no orifice. • Luh. Hasp, Reports, vol. v. p. 163.637 THE LIVER The Liver. The Liver is a grandular organ of large size, intended mainly for ^^^^f ^7j[ the bile, but effecting also important chauges in certam lon^'^^^r^X^L^^^^ in thei; passage through the gland. It is situated m the right hyP«^l^°^^"^« region, and extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondnum It is t^e largest gland in the body, weighing from three to four ounces (from fifty to sixty, ounces avoirdupois). It measures, in its transverse dian.eter, from ten to twelve inches ; from six to seven in its antero-posterior ; and is about three inches tlucjj: at the back part of the right lobe, which is the thickest part. Its upper surface is convex, directed upwards and forwards, smooth, covered by peritoneum. It is in relation with the under surface of the Diaphragm ; and below, to a small extent, with the abdominal parietes. The surface is divided into two unequal lobes, the right and left, by a fold of peritoneum, the suspensory or broad ligament. Its under surf ace is concave, directed do^vn wards, and backwards, and m relation with the stomach and duodenum, the hepatic flexure of the colon, and the right kidney and suprarenal capsule. The surface is divided by a longitudinal fissure into a right and left lobe. The posterior larder is rounded and broad, and connected to the Diaphragm by the coronary Ugament; it is in relation with the aorta, the vena cava, and the crura of the Diaphragm. The anterior harder is thin and sharp, and marked, opposite the attachment of the broad ligament, by a deep notch. In adult males, this border usually corre- sponds with the margin of the ribs ; but in women and children, it usually projects below the ribs. The riglit extremity of the liver is thick and rounded ; whilst the left is thin and flattened. CJianges of Position. The student should make himself acquainted with the different circumstances under which the liver changes its position, as they are of importance in determining the existence of enlargement, or other disease of the organ. Its position varies according to the posture of the body; in the upright and sitting posture, it usually recedes behind the ribs. Its position varies, also, with the ascent or descent of the Diaphragm. In a deep inspiration, the liver descends below the ribs; in expiration, it is raised to its ordinary level. Again, in emphysema, where the lungs are distended, and the Diaphragm descends very low, the liver is pushed down; in some other diseases, as phthisis, where the Diaphragm is much arched, the liver rises very high up. Pressure from without, as in tight lacing, by compressing the lower part of the chest, dis- places the liver considerably, its anterior edge often extending as low as the crest of the ilium; and its convex surface is often, at the same time, deeply indented from pressure of the ribs. Again, its position varies greatly, according to the greater or less distension of the stomach and intestines. When the intestines are empty, the liver descends in the abdomen ; but when they are distended, it is pushed upwards. Its relations to sur- rounding organs mny also be changed by the growth of tumours, or by collections of fluid in the thoracic or abdominal cavities. Ligaments. The ligaments of the liver (fig. 344) are five in number : four being formed of folds of peritoneum; the fifth, the ligamentmn teres, is a round, fibrous cord, resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein. The ligaments are the longitudinal, two lateral, coronary, and round. The longitudinal ligament (broad, falciform, or suspensory ligament) is a broad and thin antero-posterior peritoneal fold, falciform in shape, its base being directed forwards, its apex backwards. It is attached by one margin to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and the posterior surface of the sheath of the right Rectus muscle as low down as the umbilicus ; by its hepatic margin, it extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, as far back as its posterior border. It638 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. consists of two layers of peritoneum closely united together. Its anterior free edge contains the round ligament between its layers. The lateral ligaments, two in number, right and left, are triangular in shape. They are formed of two layers of peritoneum united, and extend from the sides of the Diaphragm to the adjacent margins of the posteiior border of the organ. The left is the longer of the two, and lies in front of the oesophageal opening in the Diaphragm. The coronarij ligament connects the posterior border of the liver to the Diaphragm. It is formed by the reflection of the peritoneum with the Diaphragm on to the upper and lower margins of the posterior border of the organ. The coronary ligament consists of two layers, which are continuous on each side with 344-—The Liver. Upper Surface. the lateral ligaments ; and in front, ■with the longitudinal ligament. Between the layers, a large oval interspace is left uncovered by peritoneum, and connected to the Diaphragm by a firm areolar tissue. This space is subdivided, near its left extremity, into two parts by a deep notch (sometimes a canal), which lodges the inferior vena cava, and into which open the hepatic veins. The round ligament (fig. 345) is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein. It ascends from the umbilicus, in the anterior free margin of the longitudinal ligament, to the notch in the anterior border of the liver, from which it may be traced along the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the liver, as far back as the inferior vena cava. FissuEES (fig. 345). Five fissures are seen upon the under surface of the liver which serve to divide it into five lobes. They are the longitudinal fissure, the fissure of the ductus venosus, the transverse fissure, the fissure for the gall-bladder and the fissure for the vena cava. The longitiidinal fissure is a deep groove, which extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, to the posterior border of the organ. It separates the right and left lobes ; the transverse fissure joins it, at right angles, about one- third from its posterior extremity, and divides it into two parts. The anterior half is called the innhilical fissure : it is deeper than the posterior part, and lodges the umbilical vein in the fcetus, or its remains (the round ligament) in the adult. This fissure is often partially bridged over by a prolongation of the hepatic sub- stance, the pons hepatis. The fissure of the ductm venosus is the back part of the longitudinal fissure639 THE LIVER. it is shorter and shallower than the anterior portion.

Under Surface. The fissure for the gall-hlaclder- (fossa cystis fellem) is a shallow, oblong fossa, placed on the under surface of the right lobe, parallel with the longitudinal fissure. It extends from the anterior free margin of the liver, which is occa- sionally notched for its reception, to near the right extremity of the transverse fissure. The fissure for the vena cava is a short deep fissure, occasionally a complete canal, which extends obliquely upwards from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure, to the posterior border of that organ, where it joins the fissure for the ductus venosus. On slitting open the inferior vena cava which is contained in it, a deep fossa is seen, at the bottom of which the hepatic veins communicate with this vessel. This fissure is separated from the transverse fissure by the lobus caudatus, and from the longitudinal fissure by the lobulus Spigelii. Lobes. The lobes of the liver, like the ligaments and fissures, are five in number : the right lobe, the left lobe, the lobus quadratus, the lobulus Spigelii, and the lobus caudatus. The right lohe is much larger than the left; the proportion between them being as six to one. It occupies the right hypochondrium, and is separated from the left lobe, on its upper surface, by the longitudinal hgament; on its under surface, by the longitudinal fissure ; and in front, by a deep notch. It is of a quadrilateral form, its under surface being marked by three fissures : the transverse fissure, the fissure for the gall-bladder, and the fissure for the inferior vena cava; and by two shallow impressions, one in front (imprcssio colica), for the hepatic flexure of the640 OEGANS OF DIGESTION. colon ; and one behind (impressio renalis), for the right kidney and suprarona capsule. The left lobe is smaller and moi-e flattened than the right. It'is situated in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions, sometimes extending as far as the upper border of the spleen. Its upper surface is convex ; its under concave surface rests upon the front of tlie stomach ; and its posterior border is in relation with the cardiac orifice of the stomach. The lobus quadratus, or square lobe, is situated on the under surface of the right lobe, bounded in front by the free surface of the liver; behind, by the trans- verse fissure; on the right, by the fissure for the gall-bladder; and, on the left, by the umbilical fissure. The lohulus Spigelii projects from the back part of the under surface of the right lobe. It is bounded, in front, by the transverse fissure ; on the right, by the fissure for the vena cava; and, on the left, by the fissure for the ductus venosus. The loltis caudatus, or tailed lobe, is a small elevation of the hepatic substance, extending obliquely outwards, from the base of the lobulus Spigelii, to the under surface of the right lobe. It separates the right extremity of the transvercc fissure from the commencement of the fissure for the inferior cava. Vessels. The vessels connected with the liver are also five in number: they are the hepatic artery, the portal vein, the hepatic vein, the hepatic duct, and the lymphatics. The hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, accompanied by numerous lymphatics and nerves, ascend to the transverse fissure, between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum; the hepatic duct lying to the right, the hepatic artery to the left, and the portal vein behind the other two. They are enveloped in a loose areolar tissue, the capsule of GHsson, which accompanies the vessels in their course through the portal canals, in the interior of the organ. The hepatic veins convey the blood from the liver. They commence at the circumference of the organ, and proceed towards the deep fossa in its posterior border, where they terminate by two large and several smaller branches, in the inferior vena cava. The hepatic veins have no cellular investment; consequently, their parietes are adherent to the walls of the canals through which they run ; so that, on a section of the organ, these veins remain widely open and solitary, and may be easily distinguished from the branches of the portal vein, which are more or less collapsed, and always accompanied by an artery and duct. The lymphatics are large and numerous, consisting of a deep and superficial set. They have been already described. Nerves. The nerves of the liver are derived from the hepatic plexus of the sympathetic, from the pneumogastric nerves, especially the left, and from the right phrenic. 1.11. ii, -u Structure. The substance of the Uver is composed of lobules, held together by an extremely fine areolar tissue, and of the ramifications of the portal vem, hepatic duct, hepatic artery, hepatic veins, lymphatics, and nerves; the whole beuig invested by a fibrous and a serous coat. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum, and invests the entire surface of the organ, excepting at the attachment of its various ligaments, and at the bottom of the different fissures, where it is deficient. It is intimately adherent to the fibrous coat. The fibrous coat lies beneath the serous investment, and covers the entire surface of the organ. It is difficult of demonstration, excepting where the serous POflt is deficient. At the transverse fissure, it is continuous with the capsule ot Glisson ; and, on the s,irface of the organ, with the areolar tissue separating the ^""^The lohules form the chief mass of the hepatic substance: they may be seen eithe^on tt ^^^^^^^^ of the organ, or by making a section through the gland.641 STRUCTURE OF LIVER. are veins, to which 346.

The remaining part of the sur- face of each lobule is imperfectly isolated from the surrounding lobules, by a thin stratum of areolar tissue, and by the smaller vessels and ducts. If one of the hepatic veins be laid open, the bases of the lobules may be seen through the thin wall of the vein, on which they rest, arranged in the form of a tesselated pavement, the centre of each polygonal space presenting a mi- nute aperture, the mouth of a sublobular vein. Each lobule is composed of a mass of cells; of a plexus of biliary ducts ; of a venous plexus, formed by branches of the portal vein ; of a radicle of an he- patic vein (intralobular) ; of minute arteries; and, probably, of nerves and lymphatics. The hepatic cells form the chief mass of the substance of a lobule, and lie in the interspaces of the capillary plexus, being probably contained in a tubular net- work, which according to some authors forms the origin of the biliary ducts. The portal vein carries the blood to the liver, from which the bile is secreted ; the hepatic vein carries the superfluous blood from the liver, and the bile-duct carries the bile secreted by the hepatic cells. The course of the circulation in the liver is best traced in the natural direc- tion, viz. from the vena portse to the hepatic vein, which is a branch of the vena cava. The portal vein (fig. 347) gives off small branches, which, as they ramify between the lobules of the liver, are called the mierlobular veins, and form a plexus surrounding the lobules. Branches from this plexus enter the substance of the lobule, forming a capillary network inside it, the intralohrd&v capillary plexus. These veins unite into one which issues from the lobule, the Miiralobular vein, forming as it were the stalk or axis of the lobule. The intralobular veins run into small branches—s«51obular—around which therefore the lobules are clustered, and which are the radicles of the hepatic veins.

The hepatic cells are of a more or less spheroidal form ; but may be rounded, flattened, or many-sided, from mutual compression. They vary in size from the to the of an inch in diameter, and contain a distinct nucleus in the interior, or sometimes two. In the nucleus is a highly refracting nucleolus, with granules. The cell-contents are viscid, and contain yellow particles, the colouring matter of the bile, and oil-globules. The cells adhere together by the surfaces, so as to form rows, which radiate from the centre towards the circum- ference of the lobule. These cells are the cHef agents in the secretion ot the ^%naino/ the Uliarij cZwcfe.—Three views have prevailed in recent times as to the origin of the biliary ducts, i. That they commence external to the lobules in an mierlobular plexus, the bile being secreted by the hepatic cells withm the lobule, and passing into the radicles of the ducts by osmosis from those cells ihis was Kiernan's view.* 2. The other two views coincide m the belief that the radicles of the biliary ducts commence within the lobules by a plexus ot intra- lobular channels, but they differ as to the relation between these channels and tbe hepatic cells ; the one which we wiU caU Beale's view, teaches that the hepatic cells are contained within the intralobular biliary channels ; 3- the other view, which we may caU Bering's, teaches that the intralobular bihary channels lie between tbe hepatic cells. This anatomist has given what appears the most mteUigible descrip- tion of the minute anatomy of the liver, and one which really coincides in many essential points with the original description of Kiernan, as ^« ^™ Beale Bering describes the liver cells as lying packed together m the channels which are formed between the meshes of the capillary blood-vessels, but sepamtecl from the wall of the capillary by a clear space. In the centre of the line whicli forms the base of a pair of cells (or more rarely in the human subject ™ t^e ang e formed by the meeting of several cells) a minute channel is formed, which is t ie radicle of the bile duct, the intralobular biliary channel, much smaller than th. CSry or the hepatic cells. Kiernan's view would confine the name of bdiary ducts to the bile passages external to the lobule (interlobular), while Beale s vie entirely external to the lobules.STRUCTURE OF LIVER. 643 349- , , 1 1 • i -n «i,onnf^l hxlci cells and all, as an intralobular would regard ^^^J^^!^'^as 6hrzouszczewsky's, bxbaz-y passage.

The ducts finally form two large trunks, which leave the liver at the transverse fissure, and the union of these is the hepatic duct. The Portal vein, on entering the liver at the transverse fissure, divides into primary branches, which are con- tained in the portal canals, together with branches of the hepatic artery and duct, and the nerves and lymphatics. In the larger portal canals, the vessels are sepa- rated from the parietes, and joined to each other, by a loose cellular web, the capsule of Glisson. The veins, as they lie in the portal canals, give off vaginal branches, which form a plexus (vaginal plexus) in Glisson's capsule. From this plexus, and from the portal vein itself, the interlobular veins are given off. The Hepatic artery appears destined chiefly for the nutrition of the coats of the large vessels, the ducts, and the investing membranes of the liver. It enters the liver at the transverse fissure, with the portal vein and hepatic duct, and ramifies with these vessels through the portal canals. It gives off vaginal branches, which ramify in the capsule of Glisson ; and 6ther branches, which are distributed to the coats of the vena port£e and hepatic duct. From the vaginal plexus, inter- lobular branches are given off, which ramify through the interlobular fissures, a few branches being distributed to the lobules. Kiernan supposes that the branches of the hepatic artery terminate in a capillary plexus, which communicates with the branches of the vena portse. The Hepatic, veins commence in the interior of each lobule by a plexus, the, branches of which converge to form the intralobular vein. The ini/ralohular vein passes through the centre of the lobule, and leaves it at its base to terminate in a sublobular vein. The suhlohular veins unite with neighbouring branches to form larger veins; and these join to form the large laepatic trunks, which terminate in the vena cava.

The gall-bladder is the reservoir for the bile; it is a conical or pear-shaped membranous sac, lodged in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver and extending from near the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the anterior free margin of the organ. It is about four inches in length, one inch in breadth at its widest part, and holds from eight to ten drachms. It is divided into a fundus, body, and neck. The fundus, or broad extremity, is directed downwards, forwards, and to the right, and occasionally projects from the anterior border of the liver : the body and neclc are directed upwards and backwards to the left. The gall-bladder is held in its position by the peritoneum, which, in the majority of cases, passes over its under surface, but the serous membrane occasionally invests the gall-bladder, which then is connected to the liver by a kind of mesentery. Relations. The body of the gall-bladder is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver, to which it is connected by areolar tissue and vessels ; but its under surface, with the first portion of the duodenum, occasionally the pyloric end of the stomach, and the hepatic flexure of the colon. The fundus is completely invested by peritoneum ; it is in relation, in front, with the abdominal parietes, immediately below the tenth costal cartilage ; behind, with the transverse arch of the colon. The neck is narrow, and curves upon itself like the italic letter/; at its point of connection with the body and with the cystic duct, it presents a well-marked constriction. When the gall-bladder is distended with hile or calculi, the fundus may be felt through the abdominal parietes, especially in an emaciated subject: the relations of this sac wdl also serve to explain the occasional occurrence of abdominal biliary fistulse, through which biliary calculi may pass out, and of the passage of calcuU from the gall-bladder mto the stomach, duodenum, or colon, which occasionally happens. Structure. The gall-bladder consists of three coats: serous, fibrous and mus- cular, and mucous. The external or serotis coat is derived from the peritoneum ; it completely mvests the fundus, but covers the body and neck only on their under surface. The middle or fibrous coat is a thin but strong fibrous layer, which forms the framework of the sac, consisting of dense fibres which interlace in all directions. Plain muscular fibres are also found in this coat, disposed chiefly in a longitudmal direction, a few running transversely. The internal or mucous coat is loosely connected with the fibrous layer. It is generally, tinged with a yellowish-brown colour, and is everywhere elevated mto minute rugse, by the union of which numerous meshes are formed; the depressed intervening spaces having a polygonal outline. The meshes are smaller at the fundus and neck, being most developed about the centre of the sac. Opposite the neck of the gall-bladder, the mucous membrane projects inwards so as to form a large valvular fold. The mucous membrane is covered with columnar epithelium, and secretes an abundance of thick viscid mucus ; it is continuous through the hepatic duct with the mucous membrane lining the ducts of the liver, and through the ductus com- munis choledochus with the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. The Biliary Ducts are, the hepatic, the cystic, and the ductus communis choledochus. . The hepatic duct is formed of two trunks of nearly equal size, which issue from the Hver at the transverse fissure, one from the right, the other from the left lobe ; these unite, and pass downwards and to the right for about an inch and a half, to join ^'^ ""8'^'^ ^^^'^ ^^^^ ^y^''^^^ ^^^^'^ ^^^^ ductus com- munis choledochus. . The cystic duct, ihe smallest of the three biliary ducts, is about an inch m Icngtli.

It is about t^-^" L'nrhtat^ the diLeter of a goose-quill, and formed by the junction of the cystic and hepahc ducts. It descends along the right border of the lesser omentum, behmd the 351 .-The Tarts in the Gastro-hepatic Omentum, its anterior Layer being removed. first portion of the duodenum, in front of the ven£B portas, and to the right of the hepatic artery ; it then passes between the pancreas and descending portion of the duodenum, and, running for a short distance along the right side of the pancreatic duct, near its termination, passes with it obliquely between the mucous and mus- cular coats, the two opening by a common orifice upon the summit of a papilla, situated at the inner side of the descending portion of the duodenum, a little below its middle. Struciure. The coats of the biliary ducts are, an external or fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The fibrous coat is composed of a strong areolai* fibrous tissue. The mucous coat is continuous with the lining membrane of the hepatic ducts and gall-bladder, and also with that of the duodenum. It is provided with numerous glands, the orifices of which are scattered irregularly in the larger ducts, but in the smaller hepatic ducts are disposed in two longitudinal rows, one on each side of the vessel. These glands are of two kinds. Some are ramified tubes, which occasionally anastomose, and from the sides of which saccular dilatations are given ofi"; others are small clustered cellular glands, which open either sepa- rately into the hepatic duct, or into the ductg of the tubular glands.ORGANS OF DIGPJSTION. 646 The Panceeas. Disseciion. The pancreas may be exposed for dissection in three different ways: i. By raising the liver, drawing down the stomach, and tearing througli the gastro-hepatic omentum and the ascending hiyer of the transverse nieso-colon. 2. liy raising the stomach, the arch of the colon, and great omentum, and then dividing the inferior layer of tiie trans- verse meso-colon.

(See fig. 332, p. 620.) The Pancreas (trav-Kpinc, all flesh) is a conglomerate gland, analogous in its structure to the salivary glands. In sbape it is ti-ansvorsely oblong, flattened from before backwards, and bears some resemblance to a dog's tongue, its right extremity being broad, and presenting a sort of angular bend from above down- wards, called the head, whilst its left extremity gradually tapers to form the tail, the intermediate portion being called the hody. It is situated transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, at the back of the epigastric and both hypo- chondriac regions. Its length varies from six to eight inches, its breadth is an inch and a half, and its thickness from half an inch to an inch, being greater at its right extremity and along its upper border. Its weight varies.from two to three and a half ounces, but it may reach six ounces. The right extremity or head of the pancreas (fig 352) is curved upon itself from above downwards, and is embraced by the concavity of the duodenum. The 352.—The Pancreas and its rielnlions. common bile-duct descends behind, between the duodenum and pancreas; and the pancreatico-daodenal artery descends in front between the same parts.^ On'the posterior aspect of the pancreas is a lobular fold of the gland, which passes ti-aus- versely to the left, behind the superior mesenteric vessels, formmg the back part of the canal in which they are contained. It is sometimes detached from the rest of the gland, and is called the Zesse7-jja?tcreas. The lesser end or tail of the pancreas is narrow ; it extends to the left as far as the spleen, and is placed over the left kidney and suprarenal capsule. The hody of the pancreas is convex in front, and covered by the ascending layer of the'transverse meso-colon and the posterior surface of the stomach.SPLEEN. ^47 between it „a the first luuibar verteta . he ™P='^°;"»^^^ j^y^ey, the commencement of the vena ports, the vena oav.., the suprarenal capsule, and the correspondmg renal vessels ThLj,j.e,lor<i., is thick, a.d l-Vl'^KTdeep g o vV^^a^^^^ in this su"ant:s.tert;:;it^^^^^^^^^^^ -p- are in relation "vvith it. . 4. i p„„m fhp +,ran8verse The lower harder, thinner than the upper, is separated from the ^-^^^verse portion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and yein to the le t of t^se the inferior mesenteric vein ascends behind the pancreas to jom the ThelaLeaiic duct, called the canal of Wirsung from its discoverer, extends transversely from left to right through the substance of the pancreas, nearer to itB lower than its upper border, and lying nearer its anterior than its posterior sur- face. In order to expose it, the superficial portion of the gland mast be removed. Traced backwards, it is found to commence by an orifice common to it and the ductus communis choledochus, upon the summit of an elevated papi la, situated at the inner side of the descending portion of the duodenum, a little below its middle: from this papilla it passes very obliquely through the mucous and muscular coats, separates itself from the ductus communis choledochus, and, ascending shghtly, runs from right to left through the middle of the gland, giving off numerous branches, which commence in its lobules. Sometimes the pancreatic duct and ductus communis choledochus open separately into the duodenum. The excretory duct of the lesser pancreas is caUed the ductus pancreatieus minor; it opens into the main duct near the duodenum, and sometimes separately into that intestine, at a distance of an inch or more from the termination of the principal duct. The pancreatic duct, near the duodenum, is about the size of an ordinary quill; its walls are thin, consisting of two coats, an external fibrous and an internal mucous ; the latter is thin, smooth, and furnished, near its termination, with a few scattered follicles. Sometimes the pancreatic duct is double, up to its point of entrance into the duodenum. In structure, the pancreas closely resembles the salivary glands ; but it is looser and softer in its texture. The fluid secreted by it is almost identical with saliva. Vessds and Nerves. The arteries of the pancreas are derived from the splenic, the pancreatico-duodenal branch of the hepatic, and the superior mesenteric. Its veins open into the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Its lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. Its nerves are filaments from the splenic plexus. The Spleek. The Spleen is usually classified, together with the thyroid, thymus, and suprarenal capsules, as one of the ductless, or blood-glands. It possesses no excre- tory duct. It is of an oblong flattened form, soft, of very brittle consistence, highly vascular, of a dark bluish-red colour, and situated in the left hj^pochondriac region, embracing the cardiac end of the stomach. It is invested by peritoneum, and connected with the stomach by the gastro-splenic omentum. Relation. The external sv/rface is convex, smooth, and in relation with the under surface of the Diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs of the left side. The internal surface is slightly concave, and divided by a vertical flssure, the hilum, into an anterior or larger, and a posterior or smaller portion. The hilum is pierced by several irregular apertures, for the entrance and exit of vessels and nerves. At the margins of the hilum, the two layers of peritoneum are reflected from the surface of the spleen on to theORGANS OF DIGESTION. 648 cardiac end of the storaacb, fox-uiing the gastro-splcnic omentum, which contains between its layers the splenic vessels and nerves, and the vasa brevia. The internal sm'face is in relation, in front, with tlie great end of the stomach; below, with the tail of the pancreas; and behind, with the left crus of the Diaphi-agm and coiTCsponding snpi'aroiial capsule. The Mjjper end, thick and rounded, is in relation with the Diaphragm, to which it is connected by a fold of peritoneum, the suspensory ligament. The loiuer end is pointed ; it is in relation with the loft extremity of the transverse arch of the colon. The anterior margm is free, I'ounded, and often notched, especially below. The posterior mcurfiin is rounded, and lies in relation with the left kidney, to which it is connected by loose areolar tissue. The spleen is held in its position by two folds of peritoneum : one, the gastro- splenic omentum, connects it with the stomach; and the other, the suspensory ligament, with the under surface of the Diaphragm. 353.—Transverse Section of the Spleen, sliowinfr the Trabecular Tissue and the Splenic Vein aud its Branches. The size and weight of the spleen are liable to very extreme variations at different periods of life, in different individuals, and in the same individual under different conditions. In the adult, in whom it attains its greatest size, it is usually above five inches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and an inch or an inch and a half in thickness, and weighs about seven ounces. At hirtli, its weight, m proportion to the entire body, is almost equal to what is observed in the adult being as i to 350 ; whilst in the adult it varies from i to 320 and 400. In old aqe the organ not only decreases in weight, but decreases considerably m pro- portion to the entire body, being as i to 700. The size of the spleen is increased durino- the after digestion, and varies considerably, according to the state ot nutrition of the body, being large in highly-fed, and small starved animals. In intermittent and other fevers, it becomes much enlarged, weighing occasionally from 18 to 20 pounds. Structure. The spleen is invested by two coats: an external serous, and ail internal fibrous elastic coat. The external, or serous coat, is derived from the peritoneum ; it is thin, smootn and in the human subject intimately adherent to the fibrous clastic coat It invests almost the entire organ ; being reflected from it, at the hiluni, on to the great end of the stomach, and at the upper end of the organ on to the Uia- phragm.STRUCTURE OF SPLEEN. 649 , . i? ^„ +1,0 frnmpwork of the spleen.

The colourless elements consist of granular matter; nuclei, about the size ot the red blood-discs, homogeneous or granular in structure; and nucleated vesicles m 354,_The Malpigliian Corpuscles, and their Eelaiion with the Splenic Artery jiud its JSranches. small numbers. These elements form, probably, one-half or two-thii'ds of the whole substance of the pulp, filling up the interspaces formed by the partitions of the spleen, and lying in close contact with the walls of the capillary vessels, so as to be readily acted upon by the nutrient fluid which permeates them. Thus in well-nourished animals, they form a large part of the entire bulk of the spleen, whilst they diminish in number, and occasionally are wanting in starved animals. The application of chemical tests show that they are essentially a proteine compound. The coloured elements of the pulp consist of red blood-globules and of coloured corpuscles, either free, or included in cells. Sometimes, unchanged blood-discs are seen included in a cell; but more frequently the included blood-discs are650 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. altered both in form and colour. Besides these, numerous deep-red, or reddish yellow, or black corpuscles and crystals, either single or aggregated in masses, are seen diffused throughout the pulp-substanco : these, in chemical composition, are closely allied to tlio hasmatiu ol:' the blood. Malpighia/n Gorjpuscles. On examining the cut surface of a healthy spleen, a number of small semi-opaque bodies, of gelatinous consistence, are seen dissemi- nated throughout its substance; these are the splenic or Malpighian corpuscles (fig. 354). They may be seen at all periods of life ; but they are more distinct in early than in adult life or old age; and they are much smaller in man than in most mammalia. They are of a spherical or ovoid form, vary considerably in size and number, and are of a semi-opaque whitish colour. They are appended to the sheaths of the smaller arteries and their branches, presenting a resemblance to the buds of the moss rose. Each consists of a membranous capsule, composed of fine pale fibres, which interlace in all directions. In man, the capsule is homo- geneous in structure, and formed by a prolongation from the sheaths of the small arteries to which the corpuscles are attached. The blood-vessels ramifying on the surface of the corpuscles, consist of the larger ramifications of the arteries to which the sacculus is connected; and also of a delicate capillary plexus, similar 355.—One of the Splenic Corpuscles, showing its Relations with the Blood-vessels, to that surrounding the vesicles of other glands. These vesicles have also a close relation with the veins (fig. 355). The latter vessels, which are of considerable size even at their origin, commence on the surface of each vesicle throughout the whole of its circumference, forming a dense mesh of veins, in whichi the Malpighian corpuscle is enclosed. It is probable, that from the blood contained in the capil- lary network, the material is separated which is occasionally stored up in the cavity of the corpuscle; the veins being so placed as to carry off, under certain conditions, those contents to be discharged again into the circulation. Each capsule contains a soft, white, semi-fluid substance, consisting of granular matter, nuclei similar to those found in the pulp, and a few nucleated cells, the composi- tion of which is apparently albuminous. These bodies are very large after digestion is completed, in well-fed animals, and especially in those fed upon albuminous diet. In starved animals, they disappear altogether.STRUCTURE OF SPLEEN. 651 The svlenic artery is remarkable for its large si.e in proportion to the size ilie bpcomc anonj „^,nT-sP It divides into from four to six of the organ; and also for its ^'^^•t--;;;^;^;^/ .,^if throughout its snbstance branches, which enter the ulum of the c^rg^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^J^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^.^^ (fig. 356), veceivuig sheaths ^'"J^'''^^^^,^^, Each branch runs in the the same sheaths also investing the nerves and ^J^^^ ^ j^^^ transverse axis of the organ, from --"un outward^^^^^^^^^ J^^^ transit, and giving off, in its passage, smaller branches, some w 1 ,c6 -Transverse Section of the Il.imnn Spleen showing the Distribution ■ of the SpkMiic Artery and its Branches. anterior, others to the posterior part; these ultimately terminate in the proper snbstance of the spleen, in small tufts or pencils of capillary vessels, which lie in direct contact with the pulp. Bach of the larger branches of the arteries supplies chiefly that region of the organ in which the branch ramifies, having^no anasto- mosis with the majority of the other branches. The ca^llaries, supported by the minute trabeculse, traverse the pulp in all directions, and terminate either directly in the veins, or open into lacunar spaces, from which the veins originate. The veins are of large size, as compared with the size of the organ; and their distribution is limited, like that of the arteries, to the supply of a particular part- of the gland ; they are much larger and moi'e numerous than the arteries. They originate, lat, as continuations of the capillaries of the arteries; 2nd, by inter- cellular spaces communicating with each other ; 3rd, by distinct caecal pouches. By this junction they form from four to six branches, which emerge from the hilum; and these uniting, form the splenic vein, the largest branch of the vena portae. The lymphatics form a deep and superficial set; they pass through the lym- phatic glands at the hilum, and terminate in the thoracic duct. The nerves are derived from branches of the right and left semilunar ganglia, and right pneumogastric nerve.The Thorax. THE Thorax is a conical framework, formed partly of bonee, and partly of the soft tissues by which they are connected together. It is supported and its back part is formed by the middle, or dorsal, region of the spine. It is narrow above, broad below, flattened before and behind, and somewhat cordiform on a transverse section. Boundaries. The thorax is bounded in front by the sternum, the six upper costal cartilages, the ribs, and intercostal muscles; at the sides, by the ribs and intercostal muscles ; and behind, by the same structures and the dorsal portion of the vertebral column. The superior ojpening of the thorax is bounded on each side by the first rib; in front, by the upper border of the sternum ; and behind, by the first dorsal vertebra. It is broader from side to side than from before backwards; and its direction is backwards and upwards. The lower opening, or base, is bounded in front by the eusiform cartilage; behind, by the last dorsal vertebra; and on each side by the last rib, the Diaphragm filling in the intervening space. Its direction is obliquely downwards and back- wards ; so that the cavity of the thorax is much deeper on the posterior than on the anterior wall. It is wider transversely than from before backwards. Its outer surface is convex; but it is more flattened at the centre than at the sides. Its floor is higher on the right than on the left side, corresponding in the dead body to the upper border of the fifth costal cartilage on the right side ; and to the corresponding part of the sixth cartilage on the left side. The parts which pass through the upper opening of the thorax are, from before backwards, the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the remains of the thymus gland, the trachea, cesophagus, thoracic duct, and the Longus colli muscles of each side ; on the sides, the arteria innominata, the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, the internal mammary and superior iutercostal arteries, the right and left vense innominatee, and the inferior thyroid veins, the pneumogastiic, sympathetic, phrenic, and cardiac nerves, the anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the left side. The apex of each lung, covered by the pleura, also projects through this aperture, a little above the margin of the first rib. The viscera contained in the thorax are, the heart, enclosed in its membranous bag, the pericardium ; and the lungs, invested by the pleurae. The Pericardium. The Pericardium is a conical membranous sac, in which the heart and the commencement of the great vessels are contained. It is placed behind the sternum, and the cartilages of the third, foiu-th, fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs of the left side, in the interval between the pleurae. Its afex is directed upwards, and surrounds the great vessels about two inches above their origin from the base of the heart. Its hose is attached to the central tendon of the Diaphragm, extending a little farther to the left than the right side. In front, it is separated from the sternum by the remains of the thymus gland above and a little loose areolar tissue below ; and is covered by the mai-gins of the lungs' especially the left. Behind, it rests upon the bronchi, the oesophagus, aufl the descending aorta. Laterally, it is covered by the plcurte •, the phrenic vessels and nerve descending between the two membranes on either side. The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane, and consists, therefore, of two layers: an external fibrous, and an internal serous.653 THE PERICARDIUM. 1 ^orv,V.rmp Above, it surrounds the great The fihror^ layer is a strong denso "^^™^ianc^^^ A _^ ^ vessels arising from the base of the heart on ^^^.^^ external coat; the tubular prolongations, which are g^acluauy pericardium maybe ti-aced, strongest being that which encloses the aorta. ^ ^.^^^ cervical fascia. the superior vena cava, and tlie puimouuij .Tr .f+l.«Thnmx Tho Ribs and Sternum are represented vena cava enters the pericardium, through the central tendon of the Diaphl-agtn, it receives no covering from the fibrous layer.

The former invests the surface of the heart, and the commencement of the great vessels, to the extent of two inches from their origin ; from these, it ia reflected upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer, lining, below, the upper surface of the central tendon of the Diaphragm. The serous membrane encloses the aorta and pulmo- nary artery in a single tube ; but it only partially covers the superior and inferior vena cava and the four pulmonaiy veins. Its inner surface is smooth and glistening, and secretes a thin fluid, which serves to facilitate the movements of the heart.THE THORAX. 6S4 The arteries of the pericardium, are derived from the internal mammary, the bronchial, the oesophageal, and the phrenic.

The heart is placed obliquely in the chest: the broad attached end or base, is directed upwards and backwards to the right, and corresponds to the interval between the fifth and eighth dorsal vertebraa: the apex is directed for- wards and to the loft, and corresponds to the interspace between the cartilage of the fifth and sixth ribs, one.inch to the inner side, and two inches below the left nipple. The heart is placed behind the lower two-thirds of the sternum, and projects further into the left than into the right cavity of the chest, extending from the median line about three inches in the former direction, and only one and a half in the latter. Its upper border would correspond to a line drawn across the sternum, on a level with the upper border of the third costal cartilages ; and its lower border, to a line drawn across the lower end of the gladiolus, from the costo-xiphoid articulation of the right side, to the point above mentioned, as the situation of the apex. The lungs cover a part of the heart, and during inspiration, when their borders nearly meet behind the sternum, a thin layer of lung covers the roots of all the large vessels. Hence the custom of making a patient hold his breath whilst examining the sounds of the heart. But a considerable portion of the heart is always uncovered by the lungs where they recede from each other below. This ' area of the heart's dulness,' as it is commonly called, is said by Mr. Holden* to be indicated, roughly, but sufficiently for practical pm-poses, by a circle one inch in I'adius, the centre of which is midway between the nipple and the end of the sternum. The anterior surface of the heart is rounded and convex, directed upwards and forwards, and formed chiefly by the right ventricle and part of the left. Its pos- terior surface is flattened, and rests upon the Diaphragm, and is foi-med chiefly by the left ventricle. The right border is long, thin, and sharp ; the left border short, but thick and round. Size. The heart, in the adult, measures five inches in length, three inches and a half in breadth in the broadest part, and two inches and a half in thickness. The prevalent weight, in the male, vai'ies from ten to twelve ounces ; in the female, from eight to ten : its proportions to the body being as i to 169 in males ; i to 149 in females. The heart continues increasing in weight, and also in length, breadth and thickness, up to an advanced period of life; this increase is more marked in men than in women. Gomponent parts. The heart is subdivided by a longitudinal muscular septum into two lateral halves, which are named respectively, from their position, right and left; and a transverse constriction divides each half of the organ into two cavities, the upper cavity on each side being called the auricle, the lower the ventricle. The right is the venous side of the heart, receiving into its auricle the dark venous blood from the entire body, by the superior and inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus. From the auricle, the blood passes into the right ventricle, and from the right ventricle, through the pulmonary artery, into the lungs. The blood, arterialized by its passage through the lungs, is returned to the left side of the heart by the pulmonary veins, which open into the left auricle ; from the left auricle the blood passes into the left venti-icle, and from the left ventricle is dis- tributed, by the aorta and its subdivisions, through the entire body. This con- stitutes the circulation of the blood in the adult. This division of the heart into four cavities is indicated by grooves upon its surface. The great transverse groove separating the auricles from the ventricles, is called the auriculo-ventrindar groove. It is deficient, in front, from being crossed by the root of the pulmonary artery, and contains the trunk of the nutrient vessels of the heart. The auricular portion occupies the base of the heart, and is subdivided into two cavities by a median septum. The two ventricles are also • ' St. Bnrth. Ilosp.

The appendiic auriciilce, so called from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular porch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its ventricular margin, from its right border to the appendix; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be earned upwards, along the inner side of the two vena3 cavse.

The superior vena cava returns the blood from the upper half of the body, and oijens into the nppor and front part of the auricle, the dii-ection of its orifice being downwards and forwards. The inferior vena cava, larger than the superior, returns the blood from the lower half of the body, and opens into the lowest part of the auricle, near the septum, the direction of its orifice being upwards and inwards. The direction of a current of blood through tho superior vena cava would consequently be towards the auriculo- ventriculai- orifice ; whilst the direction of the blood through the inferior cAva would be towards the auricular septum. This is the normal direction of the two currents in foetal life. The hiberculum Loiveri is a small projection on the right wall of the auricle, between the two cavse. This is most distinct in the hearts of quadrupeds : in man, it is scarcely visible. It was supposed by Lower to direct the blood from the superior cava towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. The coronary sinus opens into the auricle, between the inferior vena cava and the auriculo-ventricular opening. It returns the blood from the substance of the heart, and is protected by a semicircular fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, the coronary valve. The sinus, before entering the auricle, is considerably dilated. Its wall is partly muscular, and, at its junction with the great coronary vein, is somewhat constricted, and furnished with a valve, consisting of two unequal segments. Tlhe foramina Thehesii are numerous minute apertures, the mouths of small veins (venoi cordis minimoe), which open on various parts of the inner surface of the auricle. They return the blood directly from the muscular sabstance of the heart. Some of these foramina are minute depressions in the walls of the heart, presenting a closed extremity. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and the ventricle, to be presently described. Valves. The Eustachian valve is situated between the anterior margin of the inferior cava and the auriculo-ventricular orifice. It is semilunar in form, its convex margin being attached to the wall of the vein ; its concave margin, which is free, terminating in two cornua, of which the left is attached to the anterior edge of the annulus ovalis ; the right being lost on the wall of the auricle. The valve is formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane of the auricle, containing a few muscular fibres. In the fcetm, this valve is of large size, and serves to direct the blood from the inferior cava, through the foramen ovale, into the left auricle. In the adult, it is occasionally persistent, and may assist in preventing the reflux of blood into the inferior cava : more commonly, it is small, and its free margin presents a cribriform, or filamentous appearance ; occasionally, it is alto- gether wanting. The coronary valve is a semicircular fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, protecting the orifice of the coronary sinus. It prevents the regurgitation of blood into the sinus during the contraction of the auricle. This valve is occasionally double. The fossa ovalis is an oval depression, corresponding to the situation of the foramen ovale in the foetus. It is situated at the lower part of the septum auri- cularum, above the orifice of the inferior vena cava. The annulus ovalis is the prominent oval margin of the foramen ovale. It is most distinct above, and at the sides; below it is deficient. A small slit-like val\Tilar opening is occasionally found, at the upper margin of the fossa ovalis, which leads upwards, beneath the annulus, into the left auricle, and is the remains of the aperture between the two auricles in the foetus. The musculi pectinati are small, prominent muscular columns, which run across the inner surface of the appendix auriculte, and adjoining portion of the wall of the sinus. They have received the name, pectinati, from the fancied resemblance they bear to the teeth of a comb.HEART-BRIGHT VENTRICLE. 657 The Right Ventricle is triangular in form and extends from the nght auricle to near the apex of the heart.

And a muscular and tendinous apparatus connected with the tricuspid valve :— ColumuEe carnese. Chordae tendine^. The auricido-ventricidar orifice is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is situated at the base of the ventricle, near the right border of the heart, and corresponds to the centre of the sternnm between the third costal cartilages. The opening is about an inch in diameter,* oval from side to side, surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered, by the lining mem- brane of the heart, and rather larger than the corresponding aperture on the left side, being sufficiently large to admit the ends of three fingers. It is guarded by the tricuspid valve. The opening of tlve pulmonary artery is circular in form, and situated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, close to the septum ventriculorum. It is placed on the left side of the auriculo-ventricular opening, upon the anterior aspect of the heart, and corresponds to the upper border of the third costal cartilage of the left side, close to the sternum. Its orifice is gnarded by the pulmonary semilunar valves. The tricuspid valve consists of three segments of a triangular or trapezoidal shape, formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane of the heart, strengthened by a layer of fibrous tissue, and containing, according to Kiirschner and Senac, muscular fibres. These segments are connected by their bases to the aui-iculo- ventricular orifice, and by their sides with one another, so as to form a continuous annular membrane, which is attached round the margin of the auriculo-ventricular opening, their free margins and ventricular surfaces afibrding attachment to a number of dehcate tendinous cords, the cTiord.ce. tendinece. The largest and most * In the Pathological Transactions, vol. vi. p, 119, Dr. Peacock has given some careful researches upon the weight and dimensions of the heart in health and disease. He states, as the result of his investigations, that, in the healthy adult heart, the right auriculo- ventncular aperture has a mean circumference of 54-4 lines, or 4lf inches; the left auriculo-ventricular aperture a mean circumference of 44-3 lines, or 35I inches; the pul- monic orifice of 40 lines, or 3if inches ; and tlie aortic orifice of 35-5 lines, or 3/j inches : hut the dimensions of the oiitices varied grently in different cases, the right auriculo- ventricular aperture having a range of from 45 to 60 lines, and the others in the same proportion, U U '658 THE THORAX. moveable segmonfc is placed tov^ards the left side of the auriculo-ventricular opening ; interposed between that opening and the pulmonary artery. Another segment corresponds to the front of the ventricle; and a tliird to its posterior ■wall. The central part of each segment is thick and strong; the lateral margins are thin and indented. The chordas tendincas are connected with the adjacent mannns of tlie principal segments of the valve, and are further attached to each seo-ment in the following manner: i. Three or four reach the attached margin of each segment, where they are continuous with the auriculo-ventricular tendinous ring. 2. Others, four to six in number, are attached to the central thickened part of each segment. 2. The most numerous and finest are connected with the mar- ginal portion of each segment. The culmnnce cornece are the rounded muscular columns which project from nearly the whole of the inner surface of the ventricle, excepting near the opening of the pulmonary artery. They may be classified, according to their mode of connection with the ventricle, into three sets. The first set merely form prominent ridges on the inner surface of the ventricle, being attached by their entire length on one side, as well as by their extremities. The second set are attached by their two extremities, but are free in the rest of their extent ; whilst the third set (cohomnce papillares), three or four in number, are attached by one extremity to the wall of the heart, the opposite extremity giving attachment to the chordce lendinecB. The tricuspid valve is situated behind the middle of the sternum, about the level of the fourth costal cartilage. The semilunar valves, three in number,* guard the orifice of the pulmonary artery. They consist of three semicircular folds, formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane, strengthened by fibrous tissue. They are attached, by their convex margins, to the wall of the artery, at its junction with the ventricle, the straight border being free, and directed upwards in the course of the vessel, against the sides of which the valve-flaps are pressed during the passage of the blood along the artery. The free margin of each is somewhat thicker than the rest of the valve, is strengthened by a bundle of tendinous fibres, and presents, at its middle, a small projecting fibro-cartilaginous nodule, called corpus Arantii. From this nodule, tendinous fibres radiate through the valve to its attached margin, and these fibres form a constituent part of its substance throughout its whole extent, excepting two narrow lunated portions, placed on either side of the nodule, immediately behind the free margin ; here, the valve is thm, and formed merely by the lining membrane. During the passage of the blood along the pulmonary artery, these valves are pressed against the sides of its cylmder, and the course of the blood along the tube is uninterrupted ; but durmg the ventricular diastole, when the current of blood along the pulmonary artery is checked, and partly thrown back by its elastic walls, these valves become imme- diately expanded, and effectually close the entrance of the tube. When the valves are closed, the lunated portions of each are brought into contact with one another by their opposed surfaces, the three fibro-cartilaginous nodules filling up the small triangular space that would be otherwise left by the approximation of the three semilunar folds. Between the semilunar valves and the commencement of the pulmonary artery are three pouches or dilatations, one behind each valve. These are the pulmonary sinuses (sinuses of Valsalva). Similar sinuses exist between the semilunar valves and the commencement of the aorta ; they are larger than the pulmonary smuses. The blood, in its regurgitation towards the heart, finds its way into these sinuses, and so shuts down the valve-flaps. The pulmonary valves ai-e situated behind the iunction of the left ttiird rib with the sternum. • i ' + The Left Auricle is rather smaller but thicker than the right, measuring about one line and a half ; it consists, like the right, of two parts, a principal cavity or sirnis, and an appendix auricute. • The pulmonary semilunar valves have been found to be two in ""'"I^^^JIf,^;^^^^^ rDr Plnnd of St. Paul Mhm. in the 'Nortli-Western Med. and Surg.

On the inner surface of the septum auricularum may be seen a lunated impres- sion, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned up- wards. The depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. u 'J 266o THE THORAX. Tlie Left Ventricle is longer and more conical in sliape than the right ven- tricle. It forms a small part of the left side of the anterior surface of the heart, and a considerable part of its posterior surface. It also forms the apex of the heai't by its projection beyond the right ventricle. Its walls are much thicker than those of the right ventricle, the proportion being as 2 to i (Bizot). They are also thickest in the broadest pai-t of the ventricle, becoming gradually thinner towards the base, and also towards the apex, which is the tliinnest part.

The aimculo-ventricular opening is placed to the left ©f the aortic orifice, beneath the right aui'iculo-ventrieular opening, opposite the centre of the sternum. It is a little smaller than the corresponding aperture of the opposite side; and, like'it, is broader in the transverse than in the antero-posterior diameter. It is surrounded by a dense fibrous ring, covered bj the lining membrane of the heart, and guarded by the mitral valve. The aortic opening is a small circular aperture, in front and to the right side of the auriculo-ventricular, from which it is separated by one of the segments of the mitral valve. Its orifice is guarded by the semilunar valves. Its position corresponds to the sternum, on a line with the lower border of the third left costal cartilage. The mitral .valve is attached to the circumference of the auriculo-ventricular orifice in the same way that tire tricuspid valve as on the opposite side. It is formed by a dnplicature of the lining membrane, strengthened by fibrous tissue, and contains a few muscular fibres. It is larger in size, thicker, and altogether stronger than the tricuspid, and considis of tw© segments of unequal size. The larger segment is placed in front, between the auriculo-ventricular and aortic orifices, and is said to prevent the filling of the aorta during the distension of the ventricle. Two smaller segments are usually found at the angle-of junction of the larger. 'The mitral valve-flaps are furnished with chordae tendineae : the mode of attachment of which is precisely similar to those on the right side ; bnt^ they are thicker, stronger, and less numerous. The mitral valve lies in the third mter- costal space about an inch from the left border of the sternum. The semUunar valves surround the orifioe of the aorta; they are similar in structure, and in their mode of attachment, to those of the pulmonary artery. They are, however, larger, thicker, and stronger than those of the right side; the lunulas are more distinct, and the corpora Arantii larger and more prominent. Between each valve and the cylinder of the aorta is a deep depression, the sim(,s aorlici (sinuses of Valsalva) ; they are larger than those at the root of the pulmo- nary artery. The aortic valves lie close bekind the left border of the sternum, in the third intercostal space. The cohimno} carnem admit of a subdivision Into three sets, like those upon the rio-ht side ; but they are smaller, more numerous, and present a dense iaterlace- ment, especially at the apex, and upon the posterior wall. Those attached by one extremity only, the muscuU papillares, are two in numbei-, being connected one to the anterior, the other to the posterior wall ; they are of large size, and terminate by free rounded extremities, from which the chorda3 tendineaa arise. The Endocardium is the serous membrane which lines the internal surface of the heart; it assists in forming the valves by its reduplications, and is continuous with the lining membrane of the great blood-vessels.

The muscular structure of the heart consists, of bands of fibres, which present an exceedingly intricate interlacement. They are of a deep red colour, and marked with transverse striae. The musculdr fibres of the heart admit of a subdivision into two kinds : those of the auricles, and those of the ventricles : which are quite independent of one another. Fibres of the auricles. These are disposed in two layers :- a superficial layer common to both cavities, and a deep layer proper to each* The superficial fibres are more distinct on the anterior surface of the auricks^ across the bases of which they run in a transverse direction, forming a thinj but incomplete, layer. Some of these fibres pass into the septum auricularum. The internal or dsep fibres proper to each auricle consist of two sets, looped,, and annular fibres. The looped fibres pass upwards over each auricle; being attached by two extremities to> the corresponding auriculo-vehtricular rings, in front and behind. The annular fibres surround the whole extent of the appendices auriculae, and are continued upon the walls of the venae cavae and coronary sinus on the right side, and upon the pulmonary veins on the left side; at their connection with the heart. In the appendices, they interlace with the longitudinal fibres. The fibres of the ventricles are arranged in numerous layers,, of which Petti- grew,* the most recent and the best authority, describes seven. Other anatomists have regarded them differently, and indeed there must be some uncertainty on the subject, for the layers are not independent of each other, but their fibres are interlaced to a considerable extent. And it has been observed that as Petti- grew's observations were made chiefiy on the hearts of th« lower animals, they may not apply exactly to man. Yet as this description lias been received by the best anatomists, and is supported by a large series, of preparations, it seems .best to adopt it. The general result of these investigations may bo very briefly stated as follows. In the left ventricle the fibres of the first or most external layer are continuous with those of the seventh or most internal, those of the second with the sixth, and ♦ Phil. Trans. 1864.662 THE THORAX. those of the third with tho fifth, while the fourth or central layer appears to be single. The general direction of the fibres of the external layer is nearly vertical, but in- clining somewhat from left to right as they run downwards; the direction of the fibres of the internal layer is just the reverse, nearly vertical but running upwards from left to right; those of the second layer run more obliquely downwards, from left to right, and those of the sixth with a corresponding obliquity in the reversed directions. Tho obliquity of the fibres of the third layer is greater; in fact, they approach tho horizontal, as do those of the fifth in the reversed direction, while the fibres of the fourth layer run pretty nearly horizontal. The thickness of the layers increases from without inwards, so that the fourth layer, which is the middle in order of sequence, lies nearer the outer than the inner surface of the ventricular wall. The fibres of the external or supei-ficial layer arise as a rule from the auriculo-ventricular rings and from the fibrous ring surrounding the aorta, but a few of them are continued beneath the rings into the columnas carneije.* They curve round at the apex in a spiral, which forms the vjhorl or vortex, those from the ante- rior surface of the heart curving round to enter the apex posterioi'ly, and vice versa. From the apex they are traced up into the seventh layer, which is much thicker, and from which the musculi papillares and columnse carneae are chiefly formed. The apex of the heart is formed exclusively of the fibres of this first layer (or first and seventh), so that, when it is removed, the ventricle is opened. And the successive layers terminate further and further from the apex, an arrangement which has led to their fibres being described as shorter, which Pettigrew doubts, attributing the shortness of the layers to the different direction of the fibres, not to any difference in length in the individual fibres. Since the deeper layers do not descend to the apex, this is the thinnest part of the ventricle, measuring only ^th. of an inch in. thickness even in the heart of an ox. The fibres of the deeper layers are not connected with the auriculo-ventricular rings, but pass below them, each layer terminating a little below the more super- ficial layer which wraps round it, though the difference in this respect is not so great as in their depth towards the apex. The fibres of the first layer pass across the septum from one ventricle to the other, an arrangement particularly well seen at the back of the heart, where there is a set of transverse fibres described by Pettigrew as the ' hingelike fibres' of the back of the heart, and the three subjacent layers also take part in the formation of both ventricles ; but when the fourth layer is removed, the two ventricles are entirely severed from each other posteriorly. The septum is formed of the fibres of both ventricles applied to each other. The general arrangement of the fibres of the right ventricle is the same as that of the left, but the external fibres do not pass in to be continuous with the in- ternal at a single point—the apex—^but all along the anterior coronary groove. Its fibres are more delicate than those of the left, and it is regarded by Pettirgew as formed out of the left ventricle by a kind of reflection inwards of the wall of the single cavity of which the ventricles consist at one period of foetal life.f He points out that the heart at that period may be supposed to be represented by an open tube formed of spiral fibres. If, now, ^ portion of this tube or cyUnder were pushed down to meet the opposite wall, to which the fibres of the reflected portion adhere, and with which they coalesce, there would be formed an offset from the common ventricular cavity, formed pai-tly of common and partly of special fibres, as is the case in the heart. At this early period the outer layers are not formed and the apex is still ujuclosed. Their formation closes in the apex and completes the walls of the ventricles. If this is the case the septum must be formed of two elements or sets of fibres, one proper to the original single ventricle, and therefore in after life proper to the left ventricle, the other set formed from the reflected or re- • 'It is a ereat mistake to imagine that all the fibres of the ventricles arise from the auriculo-ventricular tendinous ring, tlie fact being that, with the exception of the fibres of the first and seventh layers, they are continuous beneath them.'—Pettigrew, op. cit. p. 456, note. t JSee Introduction, p. cxix.VASCULAR SYSTEM OF FCETUS. 663 ^ 4.1 I'n-lif ventricle * To t.liese of course the duplicated fibres which bow form the n ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ Pettigrew fibres which cross over from one f° left ventricle, as twice that regards the portion of the septum ^^^^'^^^ .^f ' *° particulars with regard to the which belongs to the right.

There are also several minor peculiarities. Thus the position of the heart is vertical untH the fourth month, when it commences to assume an oblique direction. Its size is also very considerable, as compared with the body, the proportion at the second month being as i to 50 : at birth it is as i to 120 : whilst, in the adult, the average is about i to 160. At an early period of foetal life, the auricular portion of the heart is larger than the ventricular, the right auricle bemg more capacious than the left ; but, towards birth, the ventricular portion becomes the larger. The thickness of both ventricles is, at first, about equal; but, towards birth, the left becomes much the thicker of the two. The foramen ovale is situated at the lower and back part of the septum auricu- larum, forming a communication between the auricles. It attains its greatest size at the sixth month. . , , o ,1 • r • The Eustachian valve is developed from the anterior border of the inferior vena cava at its entrance into the auricle. It is directed upwards on the left side of the opening of this vein, and serves to direct the blood from the inferior vena cava through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. The peculiarities in the arterial system of the foetus are the communication between the pulmonary artery and descending part of the arch of the aorta, by means of the ductus arteriosus, and the communication between the internal iliac arteries and the placenta, by means of the umbilical arteries. The ductus arteriosus is a short tube, about half an inch in length at birth, and of the diameter of a goose-quill. In the early condition, it forms the con- tinuation of the pulmonary artery, and opens into the arch of the aorta, just below the origin of the left subclavian artery; and so conducts the chief part of the blood from the right ventricle into the descending aorta. When the branches of the pulmonary arteiy have become larger relatively to the ductus arteriosus, the latter is chiefly connected to the left pulmonary artery ; and the fibrous cord, which is all * If the general idea of this is not at once obvious, it will become so by taking a roll of paper, calling one side of it the posterior and the other the anterior, and bending it at the right side of its middle till the anterior touches the posterior surfnee. The larger part to the left of the middle line represents the left ventricle, the smaller the right, and the double fold in the middle the septum ; then, if the reflected parts where they touch are gummed to each other, this will represent the coalescence of the septum with the outer wall, whereby the right ventricle borrows a separate tube from the left. The lower openings of these two tubes are closed in by the growth of the external layers. f For full and accurate descriptions of the nerves and ganglia of the heart, the student is referred to Dr. K. Lee's papers on the siibjc ct.664 THE THORAX. that remains of the ductus arteriosus in later life, will be found to be attached to the root of that vessel. The umbilical, or hypogastric a/rteries, arise from the internal iliacs, in addition to the branches given off from those vessels in the adult. Ascending along the sides of the bladder to its fundus, they pass out of the abdomen at the umbilicus, and are continued along the umbilical cord to the placenta, coiling round the umbilical vein. They return to the placenta the blood which has circulated in the system of the foetus. 360.—rian of the Foetal Circulation.

The blood, therefore which, traverses the umbilical vein, reaches the inferior cava in three different ways. The greater quantity circulates through the liver with the portal venous blood, before entering the vena cava by the hepatic veins: some enters the hver directly, and is also'returned to the inferior cava by the hepatic veins ; the smaller quantity passes directly into the vena cava, by the junction of the ductus venosus with the left hepatic vein. In the inferior cava, the blood carried by the ductus venosus and hepatic veans, becomes mixed with that returning from the lower extremities and viscera of the abdomen. It enters the right auricle, and, guided by the Eustachian valve, passes through the foramen ovale into the left auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood returned from the lungs by the pulmonary veins. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle; and, from the left ventricle, into the aorta, from whence it is distributed almost entirely to the head and upper extremities, a small quantity being probably carried into the descending aorta. From the head and upper extremities, the blood is returned by the branches of the superior vena cava to the right auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small portion of the blood from the inferior cava. From the right auricle it descends over the Eustachian valve into the right ventricle ; and, from the right ventricle, passes into the pulmonary artery. .The lungs of the foetus being solid, and almost impervious, only a small quantity of the blood of the pulmonary artery is distri- buted to them, by the right and left pulmonary arteries, which is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle : the greater part passes through the ductus arteriosus into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood transmitted by the left ventricle into the aorta. Along this vessel it descends to supply the lower extremities and viscera of the abdomen and pelvis, the chief portion being, however, conveyed by the umbilical arteries to the placenta. From the preceding account of the circulation of the blood in the foetus, it will be seen :— 1. That the placenta serves the double purpose of a respiratory and nutritive organ, receiving the venous blood from the foetus, and returning it again reoxy- genated, and charged with additional nutritive material. 2. That nearly the whole of the blood of the umbilical vein traverses the liver before entering the inferior cava ; hence the large size of this organ, especially at an early period of footal life. 3. That the right auricle is the point of meeting of a double current, the blood in the inferior cava being guided by the Eustachian valve into the left auricle, whilst that in the superior cava descends into the right ventricle. At an early period of foetal life, it is highly probable that the two streams are quite distinct; for the inferior cava opens almost directly into the left auricle, and the Eusta- chian valve would exclude the current aloug the vein from entering the right666 THE THORAX. ventruile. At a later period, as the separation between the two auricles becomes more distinct, it seems probable that some mixture of the two streams must take place. 4. The blood carried from the placenta to the fcetus by the umbilical vein, mixed with the blood from the inferior cava, passes almost directly to the ai-ch of the aorta, and is distributed by the branches of that vessel to the head and Tipper extremities: hence the large size and perfect development of those parts at birth. 5. The blood contained in the descending aorta, chiefly derived from that which has already circulated through the head and limbs, together with a small quantity from the left ventricle, is distributed to the lower extremities : heuce the small size and imperfect development of these parts at birth. Changes in the Vasculae System at Birth, At birth, when respiration is established, an increased amount of blood from the pulmonary artery passes through the lungs, which now perform their ofiBce as respiratory organs, and, at the same time, the placental circulation is cut ofiF. The foramen ovale becomes gradually closed in by about the tenth day after birth ; a valvular fold rises up on the left side of its margin, and ultimately above its Tipper part; this valve becomes adherent to the margins of the foramen for the greater part of its circumference, but, above, a valvular opening is left between the two auricles, which sometimes remains persistent. The ductus arteriosus begins to contract immediately after respiration is estab- lished, becomes completely closed from the fourth to the tenth day, and ultimately degenerates into an impervious cord, which serves to connect the left pulmonary artery to the concavity of the arch of the aorta. Of the ur)ihilical or hjpogastric arteries, the portion continued onto the bladder from the trunk of the corresponding internal iliac remains pervious, as the superior vesical artery ; and the part between the fundus of the bladder and the umbilicus tecomes obliterated between the second and fifth days after birth, and forms th.e anterior true ligament of the bladder. The umbilical veins and ductus venosus become completely obliterated between the second and fifth days after birth, and ultimately dwindle to fibrous cords; the former becoming the round ligament of the liver, the latter, the fibrous cord, which, in the adult, may be traced along the fissure of the ductus venosus.Groans of Voice and Eespiration.

The Thyroid (tivpeog, a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx. It consists of two lateral lamellEe or alse, united at an acute angle in front, forming a vertical projection in the middle line which ia 361.—Side View of the Thyroid and Cricoid Cartilages. prominent above, and called the pomum Adami. This projection is subcutaneous, more distinct in the male than in the female, and occasionally separated from the integument by a bursa mucosa. Each lamella is quadrilateral in form. Its outer surface presents an oblique ridge, which passes downwards and for- wards from a tubercle, situated near the root of the superior cornu. This ridge gives attachment to the Sterno-thyroid andThyro-hyoid muscles ; the portion of cartilage included between it and the posterior border, to part of the Inferior constrictor muscle. The inner surface of each ala is smooth, concave, and covered by mucous membrane above and behind; but in front, in the re- ceding angle formed by their junction, is attached the epiglottis, the true and false chordte vocales, the Thyro-arytenoid, and Thyro-epiglottidean muscles.

The epi^-lottis is a thin lamella of fibro-cartilage, of a yellowish colour, shaped like a leaf, and placed behind the tongue in front of the superior opening of the larynx. During respiration, its direction is vertically upwards, its free extremity curving forwards towards the base .of the tongue^ but when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue during deglutition, it is carried downwards and baclcwards, so as to completely close the opening of the larynx. Its free extremity is broad and rounded; its attached end is long and narrow^ and connected to the receding angle between the two alae of the thyroid cartilage, just below the median notch, by a long, narrow, ligamentous band, the .thyro- epiglottic ligament. It is also connected to the posterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone, by an elastic ligamentous band, the hyo-epiglottic ligament. Its anterior or lingual surface is curved forwards ^ towffla?ds the tongue, and covered by mucous membrane, which is reflected on to the sides and base of the organ, forming a median and two lateral folds, the glosso-epiglottklean ligaments. Its posterior or laryngeaZ surface is smooth, concave from side to side, convex from above downwards, and covered by mracous membrane ; when this is I'emoved, the surface of the cartilage is seen to be studded with a number of small mucous glands, which are lodged in little pits upon its surface. To its sides the aryteno- epiglottidean folds are attached. Structure. The epiglottis, cuneiform cartilages, and cornicula laryngis are composed of yellow cartilage, which shows little tendency to ossification ; but the other cartilages resemble in structure the costal cartilagesi, becoming more or less ossified in old age. Ligaments. The ligaments of the larynx are extrinsic, i.e. those connecting the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides; and intrinsic^ those which connect the several cartilaginous segmemts io each other. The ligaments connecting the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides are three in number : the thyro-hyoid membrane, and the two lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments. The thyro-hyoid membrane is a broad, fibro-elastic, membranous layer, attachedORGANS or VOICE AND RESPIRATION. 670 below to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and above to the upper border of the inner surface of the hyoid bone : being separated from the posterior surface ot the hyoid bone by a synovial bursa. It is thicker in the middle line than at either side, in which situation it is pierced by the superior laryno-eal vessels and nerve. The ttvo lateral thi/ro-hyoid ligaments are rounded, elastic cords, which pass between the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage and the extremities of the greater cornua of the hyoid bone. A small cartilaginous nodule (cartilago iritlcea), sometimes bony, is found in each. ' The ligaments connecting the thyroid cartilage to the cricoid are also three in number; the crico-thyroid membrane, and the capsular ligaments and synovial membrane. The crico-thyroid memlrane is composed mainly of yellow elastic tissue. It is of triangular shape; thick in front, where it connects together the contiguous margins of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages; thinner at each side, where it extends from the superior border of the cricoid cartilage, to the inferior margin of the true vocal cords, with which it is closely united in front. The anterior portion of the crico-thyroid membrane is convex, concealed on each side by the Crico-thyroid muscle, subcutaneous in the middle line, and crossed horizontally by a small anastomotic arterial arch, formed by the junction of the two crico-thyroid arteries. The lateral portions are lined internally by mucous membrane, and covered by the lateral Crico-arytenoid and Thyro-arytenoid muscles. A capsular ligament encloses the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid cartilage on each side. The articulation is lined by synovial membrane. The ligaments connecting the arytenoid cartilages to the cricoid, are two thin and loose capsular ligaments connecting together the articulating surfaces lined internally by synovial membrane, and strengthened behind by a strong posterior crico-arytenoid ligament, which extends from the cricoid to the inner and back part of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The ligaments of the epiglottis are the hyo-epiglottic, the thyro-epiglottic, and the three glosso-epiglottic folds of mucous membrane which connect the epiglottis to the sides and base of the tongue. The latter have been already described. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is an elastic fibrous band, which extends from the anterior surface of the epi- glottis, near its apex, to the 363.—The Larynx and adjacent parts, , . r> f i-i, 1 1 seen from above, posterior suriace 01 the body of the hyoid bone.

Between the true and false vocal cords on each side, is an oval depression, the sinus, or ventricle of the larynx which leads upwards, on the outer side of the superior vocal cord, into a cseoal pouch of variable size, the sacculus larijngis. ^ The rima glutiidis is the narrow fissure or chink between the inferior or true Yocal cords. It is the narrowest part of the cavity of the larynx, and corresponds to the lower level of the arytenoid 364.—Vertical Section of the Larynx and Upper part of the Trachea. ir/ttniil ■-TytenaiiL cartilages. Its length, in the male, measures rather less than an inch, its breadth, when dilated, varying at its widest part from a third to half an inch. In the female, these measure- ments are less bytwo or three lines. The form of the glottis varies. In its half-closed condition, it is a narrow fissure, a little enlarged and rounded behind. In quiet breathing, it is widely open, somewhat triangular, the base of the triangle directed backwards, and corresponding to the space between the separated arytenoid cartilages. In forcible expiration, it is smaller than during inspiration. When sound is produced, it is more narrowed, the margins of the arytenoid cartilages being brought into contact, and the edges of the vocal cords approximated and made parallel, the degree of ap-« proximation and tension corresponding to the height of the note produced.* The superior or false vocal cords, so called because they are not directly concerned in the production of the voice, are two folds of mucous mem- brane, enclosing a delicate narrow fibrous band, the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament. This ligament consists of a thin band of elastic tissue, attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage below the epiglottis, and behind to the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. enco-thyroid, fjLc'id 5 * On the shape of the glottis in the various conditions of breathing and speaking, see Czermak on the Laryngoscope/ translated for the New Sydenham Society.672 ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. The lower border of this ligament, enclosed in mucous membrane, forms a free crescentic margin, which constitutes the upper boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. The inferior or true vocal cords, so called from their being concerned in the production of sound, are two strong fibrous bands (inferior thyro-arytenoid Vuja- ments\ oovored on their surface by a thin layer of mucous membrane. Each ligament consists of a band of yellow elastic tissue, attached in front to the de- pression between the two alas of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid. Its lower border is continuous with the thin lateral part of the crico-thyroid membrane. Its upper border forms the lower boundary of the ventricle of tho larynx. Externally, the Thyro-arytajnoideus muscles Hes parallel with it. It is covered internally by mucous membrane, which is extremely thin, and closely adherent to its surface. The ventricle of the larynx is an oblong fossa, situated between the superior and inferior vocal cords on each side, and extending nearly their entire length. This fossa is bounded above by the free crescentic edge of the superior vocal cord; below, by the straight margin of the true vocal eord; externally, by the corresponding Thyro-arytfienoideas muscle. The anterior part of the ventricle leads up by a marrow opening into a csecal pouch of mucous membrane of variable size, called the lao-yngeal pouch. The eacculus laryngis, or laryngeal pouch, is a membi-anous sac, placed between the superior vocal cord and the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, occasionally extending as far as its upper border; it is conical in form, and curved slightly backwards, like a Phrygian cap. On the surface of its mucous membrane are the openings of sixty or seventy small follicular glands, which are lodged in the submucous areolar tissue. This sac is enclosed in a fibrous capsule, continuous below with the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament; its laryngeal surface is covered by the Arytaeno-epiglottideus inferior muscle (Compressor sacculi laryngis, EUlton) ; whilst its exterior is covered by the Thyro-epiglottideus muscle. These muscles icompress the sacculus laryngis, and discharge the secretion it contains upon the chordas vocales, the surfiaces of which it is intended to lubricate. MuscIjES. The intrinsic muscles of the larynx are eight in number ; five of which are the muscles of the chordea vocales and rima glottidis three are connected with the epiglottis. The five muscles of the chordse vocales and rima glottidis are the Crico-thyroid. Arytasnoideus. ■Crico-arytsenoideus posticus. Thyro-arytsenoideus. •Crico-arytsenoideus lateralis. The 'Crico-thyroid is triangular in form, and situated at the fore part and side of the cricoid cartilage. It arises from the front and lateral part of the cricoid cartilage; its fibres diverge, jDassing obliquely upwards and outwards, to be in- serted into the lower and inner borders of the thyroid cartilage, from near the median line in front, as far back as the inferior cornu. The inner borders of these two muscles are separated in the middle line by a triangular interval, occupied by the crico-thyroid membrane. The Crico-arytceaioideus piosticus arises from the broad depression occupying each lateral half of the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage ; its fibres pass upwards and outwards, converging to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The upper fibres are nearly horizontal, the middle oblique, and the Tower almost vertical.* * Dr. Merkel of Leipsic has described a muscular slip which occasionally extends between the outer border of the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, aud the posterior margin of the inferior cornu of the thyroid; this he calls the ' Musculus kernto-cricoideus.' It is not found in every larynx, and when present exists usually only on one side, but is occasionally found on both sides. Mr. Turner {Edinburgh Medical Journal, Feb. i860) states that it is found in about one case in live. Its action is to fi.x the lower horn of the thyroid cartilage backwards and downwards, opposing in some measure the part of the crico-thyroid muscle^ which is connected to the anterior margin of the horn.MUSCLES OF LARYNX. 673 365.—Muscles of Larynx.

It ai-ises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage and, passing obliquely upwards and backwards, is inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage, in front of the preceding muscle. The Thyro-arijtcenoideus is a broad, flat muscle, which lies parallel with the outer side of the true vocal cord. It arises in front from the lower half of the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and from the crico- thyroid membrane. Its fibres pass horizontally backwards and outwards, to be inserted into the base and anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. This muscle consists of two fasciculi. The in- ferior, the thicker, is inserted into the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage, and into the ad- jacent portion of its anterior surface; it lies parallel with the true vocal cord, to which it is occasionally adherent. The su]perior fasciculus, the thinner, is inserted into the anterior surface and outer border of the arytenoid cartilage above the preceding fibres ; it lies on the outer side of the saccalus laryngis, imme- diately beneath its mucous lining. The Arytcenoideus is a single muscle, filling up the posterior con- cave surface of the arytenoid carti- lages. It arises from the posterior surface and outer border of one arytenoid cartilage, and is inserted into the corresponding parts of the opposite cartilage. It consists of three planes of fibres : two oblique, and one transverse. The oblique fibres, the most superficial, form two fasciculi, which pass from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the opposite one. The tramvertse fibres, the deepest and most nume- rous, pass transversely across be- tween the two cartilages ; hence the Arytsienoideus was formerly con- sidered as several muscles, under the name of transvemi and obliqui. A few of the oblique fibres are oc- casionally continued round the outer margin of the cartilage, and blend with the Thyro-arytenoid or the Arytteno-opiglottidous muscle.

Arytamo-epiglottideus inferior. The Thyro-cjyigloUidaus is a delicate fasciculus, which arises from the inner surface of tlie thyroid cartilage, just external to the origin of the Thyro-arytenoid muscle, and spreading out upon the outer surface of the sacculus laryngis, some of its fibres are lost in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold, whilst others are continued forwards to the margin of the epiglottis (Depressor einrjlottidls). The Aryicuno-epiglottideufs superior consists of a few delicate muscular fasciculi, which arise from the apex of the arytenoid cartilage, and become lost in the fold of mucous membrane extending between the arytenoid cartilage and side of the epiglottis {anjteno-epigloitidean folds). The Arytoino-epiglotlideus inferior (Compressor sacculi laryngis, Hilton) arises from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attachment of the superior vocal cord; passing forwards and upwards, it spreads out upon the inner and upper part of the sacculus laryngis, and is inserted, by a broad attachment, into the margin of the epiglottis. This muscle is separated fxom the preceding by an indistinct areolar interval.* Actions. In considering the action of the muscles of the larynx, they maybe conveniently divided into two groups, viz. : i. Those which open and close the glottis. 2. Those which regulate the degree of tension of the vocal cords. I. The muscles which open the glottis are the Crico-aryt^noidei postici; and those which close it are the Arytsenoideus, and the Crico-aryt^noidei laterales. 2. The muscles which regulate the tension of the vocal cords ai'e, the Crico-thy- roidei, which tense and elongate them ; and the Thyro-aryt^noidei, which lelax and shorten them. The Thyro-epiglottideus is a depressor of the epiglottis, and the Arytasno-epiglottidei constrict the superior aperture of the larynx, compress the sacculi laryngis, and empty them of their contents. The Crico-arytmnoidei postici separate the chordee vocales, and, consequently, open the glottis, by rotating- the base of the arytenoid cartilages outwards and backwards; so that their anterior angles, and the ligaments attached to them, become widely separated, the vocal cords, at the same time, being made tense. The Crico-arytanoiclei laterales close the glottis, by rotating the base of the arytenoid cartilages inwards, so as to approximate their anterior angles. The Arytanoidezis wr«sc/e approximates the arytenoid cartilages, and thus closes the opening of the glottis, especially at its back part. The Crico-thyroid muscles produce tension and elongation of the vocal cords, by drawing down the thyroid cartilage over the cricoid. The Thyro-arytcenoidei muscles draw the aiytenoid cartilages, together with the part of the cricoid to which they are connected; forwards towards the thyroid, and thus shorten and relax the vocal cords. . The Thyro-epiyhttidei depress the epiglottis, and assist in compressms the sacculi laiyngis. The ArytEeno-epiglottideus superior constricts the superior aperture of the larynx, when it is drawn upwards, during deglutition, and the opening closed by the epiglottis. The Arytfeno- epiglottideus inferior, together with some fibres of the Thyro-aryttenoidei, compress the sacculus laryngis. The Mucous Membrane of the larynx is continuous, above, with that lining the mouth and pharynx, and is prolonged through the trachea and bronchi into the lungs. It lines both surfaces of the epiglottis, to which it is closely adherent, and forms the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, which encircle the superior aperture of the larynx. It lines the whole of the cavity of the larynx ; forms, by its redupli- cation, the chief part of the superior, or false, vocal cord: and, from the ventricle, is continued into the sacculus laryngis. It is then reflected over the true vocal cords, where it is thin, and very intimately adherent; covers^ the inner surface of the' cricoid-thyroid membrane, and cricoid cartilage ; and is ultimately continuous * MuscuLTTS TRITICEO-GLOSSXJS.

It is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium, below the superior vocal cord; but, above this point, the cilue are found only in front, as high as the middle of the epiglottis. In the rest of its extent, the epithelium is of the squamous variety. Glands. The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with numerous muciparous glands, the orifices of which are found in nearly every part; they are very numerous upon the epiglottis, being lodged in Httlo pits m its substance ; they are also found in large numbers along the posterior margin of the aryteno- epiglottidean fold, in front of the arytenoid cartilages, where they are termed the arytenoid glands. They exist also in large numbers upon the inner surface of the sacculus laiyngis. None are found on the vocal cords. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries of the larynx are the laryngeal branches derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins empty themselves into the superior, middle, and inferior thyi-oid veins. The lymphatics terminate in the deep cervical glands. The nerves are the superior laryngeal, and the inferior or recurrent laryngeal branches of the pueumogastric nerves, joined by filaments 367.—Front View of Cartilages of Larynx: the Trachea and Bronchi. from the sympathetic. The superior laryngeal nerves supply the mucous mem- brane of the laiynx, and the Crico-thyroid muscles. The inferior laryngeal nerves supply the remaining muscles. The Arytenoid muscle is supplied by both nerves.ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. 676 The Trachea. (Fig. 367.) The trachea, or air-tube, is a cartilaginous and membranous cylindrical tube, flattened posteriorly, which extends from the lower part of the larynx, on a level with the fifth cervical vertebra, to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi, one for each lung. The trachea measures about four inches and a half in length; ifcs diameter, from side to side, is from three quarters of an inch to an inch, being always greater in the male than in the female. Belations. The anterior surface of the trachea is convex, and covered in the neclc, from above downwards, by the isthmus of the thryoid gland, the infei-ior thyroid veins, the arteria thyroidea ima (when that vessel exists), the Sterno- hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the cervical fascia (in the interval between those muscles), and, more superficially, by the anastomosing branches between the anterior jugular veins : in the thorax, it is covered from before backwards by the first piece of the sternum, the remains of the thymus gland, the arch of the aorta, the innominate and left carotid arteries, and the deep cardiac plexus. It lies upon the oesophagus, which is directed to the left near the arch of the aorta ; laterally, m the neck, it is in relation with the common carotid arteries, the latex-al lobes of the thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid arteries, and recurrent laryngeal nerves; and, in the thorax, it lies in the interspace between the pleurae, having the pneumogastric nerve on eacb side of it. The Eight Bronchus, wider, shorter, and more horizontal in direction than the left, is about an inch in length, and enters the right lung, opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra. The vena azygos arches over it, from behind; and the right pulmonary artery lies below, and then in front of it. The Left Bronchus is smaller, more oblique, and longer than the right, being nearly two inches in length. It enters the root of the left lung, opposite the fifth dorsal vertebra, about an inch lower than the right bronchus. It crosses in front of the oesophagus, the thoracic duct, and the descending aorta; passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above, and then in front of it. If a transverse section is made across the trachea, a short 368.—Transverse Section of the Trachea, just distance above its point of bifurcation, atoye its Bifurcation, with a birds eye view and a bird s eye view taken ot its in- terior (fig. 368), the septum placed at the bottom of the trachea and separating ' ^ the two bronchi will be seen to occupy the left of the median line, as was first shown by Mr. Goodall, of Dublin, so that any solid body dropping into the trachea, would naturally be directed towards the right bronchus, and this tendency is undoubtedly aided by the laro-er size of this tube, as compared with its fellow. This fact serves to explain why a foreign substance in the trachea generally falls into the right bronchus. The trachea is composed of imperfect cartilaginous rings, fibrous membrane, muscular fibres, longitudinal yellow elastic fibres, mucous membrane, and glands. The Cartilages vary from sixteen to twenty in number : each forms an imper- fect ring, which surrounds about two-thirds of the cylinder of the trachea, being imperfect behind, where the tube is completed by fibrous membrane. The carti- lages are placed horizontally above each other, separated by narrow membranous intervals. They measure about two lines in depth, and half a Hue in thickness. Their outer surfaces are flattened, but, internally, they are convex, from being thicker in the middle than at the margins. The cartilages are connected together at their margins, by an elastic fibrous membrane, which covers both their surfaces; and in the space between their extremities, beliind, forms a distinct layer. The peculiar cartilages are the first and the last.TRACHEA. 677 • 1. -q „ +iioTi rpst and sometimes divided at one end ; The first cariaage is broader ^^^^^ j^^^^^''^^^^, l^.rder of the cricoid cartilage, it is connected by fibrous membrane with the 1°^^^ " .ith which, or with the succeeding ^-f}^-^^^^^^^^ of its lower The last cc-tUage is thick and ^-ad in the m.dd^ in co q ^^^^ border being prolonged downwards^^and, at ^e^^^ j j ' , the point of bifurcation of the trachea.

It is continuous above with that of the larynx, and below with that ot the lungs. i. p The Tracheal Glands are found in great abundance at the posterior part ot the trachea. They are small, flattened, ovoid bodies, placed between the fibrous and muscular coats, each fiirnished with an excretory duct, which opens on the surface of the mucous membrane. Some glands of smaller size are also found at the sides of the trachea, between the layers of fibrous tissue connecting the rings, and others immediately beneath the mucous coat. The secretion from these glands serves to lubricate the inner surface of the trachea. Vessels and Nerves. The trachea is supplied with blood by the inferior thyroid arteries. The veins terminate in the thyroid venous plexus. The nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and its recurrent branches, and from the sym- pathetic. Stirgical Anatomy. The air-passage may he opened in three different situations: through the crico-thyroid memhrane {laryngotomy), through the cricoid cartilage, and upper ring of the trachea (laryngo-tracheotomy), or through the trachea below the isthmus of the thyroid gland {tracheotomy). The student should, therefore, carefully consider the relative anatomy of the air-tube in each of these situations. Beneath the integument of the laryngo-tracheal region, on either side of the median line, are the two anterior jugular veins. Their size and position vary ; there is nearly always one, and frequently two: at the lower part of the neck they diverge, passing beneath the Sterno- mastoid muscles, and are frequently connected by a transverse communicating branch. These veins should, if possible, always be avoided in any operation on the larynx or trachea. If cut through, considerable hfemorrhage occurs. Beneath the cervical fascia are the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the conti- guous edges of the former being near the median line; and beneath these muscles the following parts are met with, from above downwards: the thyroid cartilage, the crico- thyroid membrane, the cricoid cartilage, the trachea, and the isthmus ot the thyroid gland. The crico-thyroid space is very superficial, and may be easily felt beneath the skin as a depression, about an inch below the pomum Adanii; it is crossed transversely by a small artery, the crico-thyroid, the division of which is seldom accompanied by any troublesome hEemorrhage. The isthmus of the thyroid gland usually crosses the second and third rings of the trachea; above it is found a large transverse communicating branch between the superior thyroid veins, and the isthmus is covered by a venous*plexus, formed between the thyroid veins of opposite sides. On the sides of the thyroid gland, and below it, the veins converge to a single median vessel, or to two trunks which descend along the median line of the front of678 SURGICAL ANATOMY OP LARYNX AND TRACHEA. the trachea, to open into the innominate veins by valved orifices. In the infant, the thymus gland ascends a variable distance along the front of the trachea: and the innominate artery crosses the tube obliquely at the root of the neck, from left to right. The ai-teria thyroidea ima, when that vessel exists, passes from below upwards along the front of the trachea. The upper part of the trachea lies comparatively superficial; but the lower part passes obliquely downwards and backwards, so as to bo deeply placed between the converging Sterno-maBtoicl muscles. In the child, the trachea is smaller, more deeply placed, and more moveable than in the adult. In fat, or short-necked people, or in those in whom the muscles of the neck are prominently developed, the trachea is more deeply placed than in the opposite conditions. 369.—Surgical Anatomy of Laryngo-Tracheal Region. In the Infant. From these observations, it must be evident that laryngotomy is anatomically the most simple operation, can most readily be performed, and should always be preferred, when particular circumstances do not render the operation of tracheotomy absolutely necessary. The operation is performed thus: The head being thrown back and steadied by an assistant, the finger is passed over the front of the neck, and the crico-thyroid depression felt for. A vertical incision is then made through the skin, in the middle line over this spot, and the crico-thryoid membrane is divided to a sufficient extent to allow of the introduction of a, large curved tube. The crico-thyroid artery is the only vessel of importance crossing this space. If it should be of large size, its division might produce troublesome haemorrhage. Laryngo-tracheotomy, anatomically considered, is more dangerous than tracheotomy, on account of the small interspace between the cricoid cartilage and the isthmus of the thyroid gland: the communicating branches between the superior thyroid veins, which cover this spot can hardly fail to be divided; and the greatest care will not, in some cases, prevent the division of part of the thryoid isthmus. If either of these structures is divided, the haemorrhage may be considerable. _ mi. i_ - v. • Tracheotomy below the isthmus of the thyroid gland as performed thus: ihe heaa being thrown back and steadied by an assistant, an incision, an inch and a half or two inches in length is made through the skin, in the median line of the neck, from a little below- the cricoid cartilage, to the top of the sternum. The anterior jugular veins should be avoided, bv keeping exactly in the median line; the deep fascia should then be divided, and the contitruous borders of the Sterno-hyoid muscles separated from each other. A quantity of loose'areolar tissue, containing the inferior thyroid veins, must then be separated from the front of the trachea, with the handle of the scalpel; and when the trachea is well exposed, it should be opened by inserting the knife into it, dividing two or three of its rings from below upwards It is a matter of the greatest importance to restrain, if possible, all h^mor- rhao^e before the tube is opened j otherwise, blood may pass into the trachea, aud suttocate the patient.679 PLEURAE.

The interspace or cavity between these two layers is called the cavity of ihe pleura. Each pleura is there- fore a shut sac, one occupying the right, the other the left half of the thorax ; and they are perfectly separate, not communicating with each other. The two pleursa do not meet in the middle line of the chest, excepting at one point in front; an interspace being left between them, which contains all the viscera of the thorax, excepting the lungs : this is the mediastinum. Beflectims of the pleura (fig. 370). Commencing at the sternum, the pleura passes outwards, covers the costal cartilages, the inner surface of the ribs and Intercostal muscles, and at the back part of the thorax passes over the thoracic ganglia and their branches, and is reflected upon the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae, where it is separated by a narrow interspace from the opposite pleura, the posterior medias- tinum. From the vertebral column the pleura passes to the side of the peri- cardium, which it covers to a slight extent; it then covers the back part of the root of the lung, from the lower border of which a triangular fold descends verti- cally by the side of the posterior mediastinum to the Diaphragm. This fold is the broad Hgament of the lung, the llgamentum latum puhnonis, and serves to retain the lower part of that organ in position. From the root, the pleura may be traced68o ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. over tlie convex surface of the lung, the summit and base, and also over the sides of the fissures between the lobes. It covers its anterioi- surface, and the front part of its root, and is reflected upon the side of the pericardium to the inner suxface of the sternum. Jieloiv, it covers the under surface of the Diaphragm. Above, its apex projects, in the form of a cul-de-sac, through the superior opening of the thorax into the neck, extending about an inch above the margin of the first rib, and receives the summit of the corresponding lung : this sac is strengthened, ac- cording to Dr. Sibson, by a dome-like expansion of fascia, derived from the lower part of the Scaleni muscles. A little above the middle of the sternum, the contiguous surface of the two pleura) are sometimes in contact for a slight extent; but above and below this point, the interval left between them forms the anterior mediastinum. The inner surface of the pleura is smooth, polished, and moistened by a serous fluid : its outer surface is intimately adherent to the surface of the lung, and to the pulmonary vessels as they emerge from the pericardium ; it is also adherent to the upper surface of the Diaphragm: throughout the rest of its extent, it is somewhat thicker, and may be separated from the adjacent parts with extreme facility. The right pleural sac is shorter, wider, and reaches higher in the neck than the left. Vissels and Nerves. The arteries of the pleura are derived from the intercostal, the internal mammary, the phrenic, inferior thyroid, thymic, pericardiac, and bronchial. The veins correspond to the arteries. The hjmphaiics are very numerotis. The nerves are derived from the phrenic and sympathetic (Luschka). Kolliker states that nerves accompany the ramifications of the bronchial arteries in the pleura pulmonalis. Mediastinum. The mediastinum is the space left in the median line of the chest by the non- approximation of the two pleuras. It extends from the sternum in front to the spine behind, and contains all the viscera in the thorax, excepting the lungs. The mediastinum is subdivided, for the convenience of description, into the anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior mediastinum is bounded in front by the sternum, on each side by the pleura, and behind by the pericardium. Owing to the oblique position of the heart towards the left side, this space is not parallel with the sternum, but directed obliquely from above downwards, and to the left of the median line ; it is broad below, narrow above, very narrow opposite the second piece of the stemnm, the contiguous surfaces of the two pleura being occasionally united over a small space. The anterior mediastinum contains the origins of the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the Triangularis sterni, the internal mammary vessels of the left side, the remains of the thymus gland, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, in which some lymphatic vessels are found ascending from the convex surface of the liver. The middle mediastinum is the broadest part of the interpleural space. It con- tains the heart enclosed in the pericardium, the ascending aorta, the superior vena cava, the bifurcation of the trachea, the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the phrenic nerves. The posterior mediastinum is an irregular triangular space, running parallel -with the vertebral column ; it is bounded in front by the pericardium and roots of the lungs, behind by the vertebral column, and on either side by the pleura. It con- tains the descending aorta, the greater and lesser azygos veins and left superior intercostal vein, the pneumogastric and splanchnic nerves, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, and some lymphatic glands.THE LUNGS. i._The Posterior Mediastinum. Anterior Vi The Lungs. The Lungs are the essential organs of respiration; they are two in number, placed one in each of the lateral cavities of the chest, separated from each other by the heart and other contents of the mediastinum. Each lung is conical in shape, and presents for examination an apex, a base, two borders, and two sui'face3 (see fig. 373).ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. 682 The apex forms a tapering cone, whicli extends into the root of the neck, about an inch to an inch and a half above tlie level of the first rib. The base is broad, concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the Diaphragm ; its circumference is thin, and fits into the space between the lower ribs and the costal attachment of the Diapliragm, extending lower down externally and behind than in front, 372.—The Posterior Mediastinum and Root of the Neck.

It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects below between the ribs and the Diaphragm. 373—Front View of the Heart and Lungs. The antenor border is thin and sharp, and overlaps the front of the peri- cardium. The anterior border of the right lung corresponds to the median line of the sternum, and is in contact with its fellow, the pleurae being interposed, as low as the fourth costal cartilage; below this, the contiguous borders are separated by an irregularly shaped interval, formed at the expense of the anterior border of the left lung, and in which the pericardium is exposed. Each lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and lower, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the upper part of the posterior border of the organ, about three inches from its apex, downwards and forwards to the lower part of its anterior border. This fissure penetrates nearly to the root. In the right lung the upper lobe is partially divided by a second and shorter fissure, which extends from the middle of the preceding, forwards and upwards, to the anterior margin of the organ, marking oS a small triangular portion, the middle lobe. The right lung is the larger; it is broader than the left, owing to the inclina- tion of the heart to the left side; it is also shorter by an inch, in consequence of the Diaphragm rising higher on the right side to accommodate the hver. The right lung has three lobes.684 'ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. The left lung is smaller, narrower, and longer than the right, and has only two lobes. A little above the middle of the inner snrfaoe of each lung, and nearer its pos- terior than its anterior border, is its root, by which the Imig is connected to the heart and the trachea. Tlio root is formed by the bronchiiil tube, the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary veins, tlie bronchial arteries and veins, the pulmonary plexus of nerves, lymphatics, bronchial glands, and areolar tissue, all of which are enclosed by a reflection of the pleura. The root of the right lung lies behind the superior vena cava and upper part of the right auricle, and below the vena azygos. That of the left lung passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and in front of the descending aorta; the phrenic nerve and the anterior pulmonary plexus lie in front of each, and the pueumogaatric and posterior pulmonary plexus behind each. The chief structures composing the root of each lung are arranged in a similar manner from before backwards on both sides, viz.: the pulmonary veins most anterior; the pulmonary artery in the middle ; and the bronchus, together with the bronchial vessels, behind. From above downwards, on the two sides, their arrangement differs, thus: On the right side, their position is, bronchus, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins ; but on the left side their position is, pulmonary artery, bronchus, pulmonary veins; which is accounted for by the bronchus being placed on a lower level on the left than on the right side. The iveight of both lungs together is about forty-two ounces, the right long being two ounces heavier than the left; but much variation is met with according to the amount of blood- or serous fluid they may contain. The lungs are heavier in the male than in the female, their proportion to the body being, in the former, as I to 37, in the latter as i to 43. The specific gravity of the lung-tissue varies from 345 to 746, water being 1,000. The colour of the lungs at birth is a pinkish white; in adult life, a dark slate colour, mottled in patches; and, as age advances, this mottling assumes a black colour. The colouring matter consists of granules of a carbonaceous substance deposited in the areolar tissue near the surface of the organ. It increases in quantity as age advances, and is more abundant in males than in females. The posteiior border of the lung is usually darker than the anterior. The surface of the lung is smooth, shining, and marked out into numerous polyhedral spaces, indicating the lobules of the organ: the area of each of these spaces is crossed by numerous lighter lines. The substance of the lung is of a light, porous, spongy texture ; it floats in water, and crepitates when handled, owing to the presence of air in the tissue; it is also hio-hly elastic; hence the collapsed state of these organs when they are removed from the closed cavity of the thorax. Structure. The lungs are composed of an external serous coat, a subserous areolar tissue, and the pulmonary substance or parenchyma. The serous coat is derived from the pleura; it is thin, transparent, and invests the entire organ as far as the root. The suhserous areolar tissue contains a large proportion of elastic fibres; it invests the entire surface of the lung, and extends inwards between the lobules. The parenchyma is composed of lobules, which, although closely connected together by an interlobular areolar tissue, are quite distinct from one another, and are easily separable in the foetus. The lobules vary in size ; those on the surface are laro-e, of a pyramidal form, the base turned towards the surface ; those in the interior smaller, and of various forms. Each lobule is composed of one of the ramifications of the bronchial tube and its terminal air-cells, and of the ramifica- tions of the pulmonary and bronchial vessels, lymphatics, and nerves : all of these structures being connected together by areolar fibrous tissue The bronchus upon entering the substance of the lung, divides and subdivides dichotomously throughout the entire organ.

The cartilages are not imperfect rings, but consist of thin laminre, of varied form and size, scattered irregularly along the sides of the tube, being most distinct at the points of division of the bronchi. They may be traced into tubes, the dia- meter of which is only one-fourth of a line. Beyond this point, the tubes are wholly membranous. The fibrous coat, the longitudinal elastic fibres, are continued intoORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. 686 the smallest ramifications of tlie bronclii. The muscular coat is disposed in the form of a continuous layer of annular fibres, which may be traced upon the smallest bronchial tubes: they consist of the unstriped variety of muscular fibre. The mucous membrane lines the bronchi and its ramifications throughout, and is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium. According to the observations of Mr. Rainey,* the lobular bronchial tubes, on entering the substance of the lobules, divide and subdivide from four to nine times according to the size of the lobule, continuing to diminish in size until they attain a diameter of ^th to ^Vth of an inch. They then become changed in structure, losing their cylindi'ical form, and are continued onwards as irregular passages (intercellular passages, Rainey—air-sacs, Waters), through the substance of the lobule,^ their sides and extremities being closely covered by numerous saccular dilatations, the air-cells. This arrangement reaembles most closely the naked-eye appearances observed in the reticulated structure of the lung of the tortoise, and other reptilia. Opinions have difi^ered as to the existence of communications or anastamoses between the intercellular passages, or air-sacs. According to Dr. Waters,! these air-sacs, as he terms them, are arranged in gi-oups, or ' lobulettes,' of five or six, which spring from the terminal dilatation of a single bronchial tube, but have no other communication with each other, or with neighbouring lobulettes, than that which is afforded by their common connection with the bronchial tubes. The air-cells, or alveoli (Waters), are small, polyhedral, alveolar recesses, separated from each other by thin septa, and communicating freely with the inter- cellular passages or air-sacs. They are well seen on the surface of the lung, and vary from ^^th to ^th of an inch in diameter; being largest on the surface, at the thin borders, and at the apex ; and smallest in the interior. At the termination of the bronchial tubes, in the intercellular passages, their constituent elements become changed : their walls are formed by an interlacing of the longitudinal elastic bundles with fibrous tissue ; the muscular fibres disappear, and the mucous membrane becomes thin and delicate, and lined with a layer of squamous epithelium. The latter membrane lines the air-cells, and forms by its reduplications the septa intervening between them. The Pulmonary Artery conveys the venous blood to the lungs : it divides into branches which accompany the bronQhial tubes, and terminates in a dense capillary network, upon the walls of the intercellular passages and air-cells. Prom this network, the radicles of the pulmonary veins arise ; coalescing into large branches they accompany the arteries, and return the blood, purified by its passage through the capillaries, to the left auricle of the heart. In the lung, the branches of the pulmonary artery are usually above and in fi-ont of a bronchial tube, the vein below. The Pulmonary Capillaries form plexuses which lie immediately beneath the mucous membrane, on the walls and septa of the air-cells, and upon the walls of the intercellular passages. In the septa between the cells, the capillary network forms a single layer. The capillaries form a very minute network, the meshes of which are smaller than the vessels themselves ; J their walls are also exceedingly thin. The vessels of neighbouring lobules are distinct from each other, and do not anastomose ; and, according to Dr. Waters, those of the separate groups of intercellular passages, or air sacs (which groups he denominates lobulettes), are also independent; so that in the septa between two adjoining lobulettes, there would be a double layer of capillai'ies, one layer belonging to each of the adjacent air-sacs, or intercellular passages.

The Bronchial Arteries supply blood for the nutrition of the lung : they are derived from the thoracic aorta, and, accompanying the bronchial tubes, are dis- tributed to the bronchial glands, and upon the walls of the larger bronchial tubes and pulmonary vessels, and terminate in the deep bronchial veins. Others arc distributed in the interlobular areolar tissue, and terminate partly in the deep, partly in the superficial, bronchial veins. Lastly, some ramify upon the walls of the smallest bronchial tubes, and terminate in the pulmonary veins. The SuferfirAal and Deep Bronchial Veins unite at the root of the lung, and terminate on the right side in the vena azygos ; on the left side, in the superior intercostal vein. According to Dr. Waters, the bronchial veins do not exist within the proper substance of the lung, but commence at or near the root of the limg, by branches Avhich lie on the large bronchial tubes. He also denies that the bronchial arteries contribute to the formation of the pulmonary plexus, believing that the communi- cation between the bronchial and pulmonary system of vessels takes place in the pulmonary veins. If this view be correct, almost the whole of the blood carried by the bronchial arteries must be returned to the heart by the pulmonary veins, and thus the great mass of pure, or arterial, blood which is carried by the pulmo- nary veins would be adulterated by a small quantity of carbonized or venous blood, which has passed through the bronchial circulation. The Lymphatics consist of a superficial and deep set: they terminate at the root of the lung, in the bronchial glands. Nerves. The lungs are supplied from the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses, formed chiefly by branches from the sympathetic and pneumogastric. The filaments from these plexuses accompany the bronchial tubes, upon which they are lost. Small ganglia are found upon these nerves. Thteoid Gland. The thyroid gland bears much resemblance in structure to other glandular organs, and is usually classified together with the thymus, supra-renal capsules, and spleen, under the head of ductless glands, since it has no excretory duct Its function IS unknown, but, from its situation in connection with the trachea and larynx, the thyroid body is usually described with those organs, although it takes no part m the function of respiration. It is situated at the upper part of the trachea, and consists of two lateral lobes, placed one on each side of that tube and connected together by a narrow transverse portion, the isthmus Its anterior surface is convex, and covered by the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid and Omo-hyoid muscles. ^ ' carotid artery ""^"^ ^'^^^ sheath of the common ^ Its posterior smface is concave, and embraces the trachea and larynx.

Its situation presents, however, many variations, a p.oint of importance in the operation of tracheotomy. Sometimes the isthmus is altogether wanting. A thii'd lobe, of conical shape, called the pyramid, occasionally arises from the left side of the upper part of the isthmus, or from the left lobe, and ascends as high as the hyoid bone. It is occasionally quite detached, or divided into two parts, or altogether wanting. A few muscular bands are occasionally found attached, above, to the body of the hyoid bone, and below, to the isthmus of the gland, or its pyramidal process. These form a muscle, which was named by Sommerring the Levator glandulce thyroidece. Structure. The thyroid consists of numerous minute closed vesicles, composed of a homogeneous membrane, inclosed in a dense capillary plexus, and connected together into imperfect lobules, by areolar tissue. These vesicles are spherical or oblong, perfectly distinct, and contain a yellowish fluid, in which are found floating numerous ' dotted corpuscles ' and cells. The fluid coagulates by heat or alcohol, but preserves its transparency. In the fostus, and in young subjects, the corpuscles lie in a single layer, in contact with the inner surface of these cavities, and become detached during the process of growth. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries supplying the thyroid are the superior and inferior thyroid, and sometimes an additional branch (thyroidea media, or ima) from the arteria innpminata, or the arch of the aorta, which ascends upon the front of the trachea. The arteries are remarkable for their large size and frequent anastomoses. The veins form a plexus on the surface of the gland, and on the front of the trachea, from which arise the superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins; the two former terminating in the internal jugular, the latter in the vena innominata. The lymphatics are numerous, of large size, and terminate in the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts. The nerves are derived from the pneumogastric, and from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. Chemical Composition. The thyroid gland consists of albumen, traces of gelatine, stearine, oleine, extractive matter, alkaline, and earthy salts, and water. The [salts are chloride of sodium, alkaline sulphates, phosphate of potash, lime, magnesia, and a trace of oxide of iron. Thymus Gland. The thymus gland presents much resemblance in structure to other glandular organs, and is another of the organs denominated ductless glmids. The thymus gland is a temporary organ, attaining its full size at the end of the second year, when it ceases to grow, and gradually dwindles, until, at puberty, it has almost disappeared. If examined, when its growth is most active, it will be found to consist of two lateral lobes, placed in close contact along the middle line, situated partly in the anterior mediastinum, partly in the neck, and extending from the fourth costal cartilage upwards, as high as the lower border of the thyroid gland. It is covered by the sternum, and by the origins of the Sterno- hyoid and Stemo-thyroid muscles. In the mediastinum, it rests upon the pericar- dium, being separated from the arch of the aorta and great vessels by the thoracic fascia. In the neck, it lies on the front and sides of the trachea, behind the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles. The two lobes generally differ in size • they are occasionally united, so as to form a single mass; and sometimes separated by an intermediate lobe. The thymus is of a pinHsh-grey colour, soft, and lobulated on its surfaces. It is about two inches in length, one and a half in breadth, below, and about three or four lines in thickness. At birth it weighs about half an ounce.689 THYMUS GLAND. SMure. Bach lateral lobe is composed of numerous lobules, bold together by delicate areolar tissue; the entire gland being enclosed m anmvestmg capsule of a similar, but denser structure. The primary lobules vary m s,ze from a pm s head to I small pea. Each lobule contains, in its interior, a small cavity, which is surrounded with smaller or secondary lobules, also ho low. The cavities of the secondary and primary lobules communicate ; tbose of the latter opening into the great central cavity, ov .eservoir of the thymus, which extends through the entire leno-th of each lateral half of the gland. The central cavity is lined by a vascular membrane, which is prolonged into all the subordinate cavities, and contams a milk-white fluid resembling chyle. If the investing capsule and vessels, as well as the areolar tissue connecting the lobules, are removed from the surface of either lateral lobe, it will be seen that the central cavity is folded upon itself, and admits of being drawn out into a lengthened tubular cord, around which the primary lobules are attached^in a spiral manner, like knots upon a rope. Such is the condition of the organ at an early period of its development; for Mr. Simon has shown, that the primitive form of the thymus is a linear tube, from which, as its development proceeds, lateral diverticula lead outwards, the tube ultimately becoming obscure, from its surface being covered with numerous lobules. According to Oesterlen and Mr. Simon, the cavities in the secondary lobules are surrounded by rounded saccular dilatations or vesicles, which open into it. These vesicles are formed by a homogeneous membrane, enclosed in a dense capillary plexus. The whitish fluid contained in the vesicles and central cavity of the thymus contains numerous dotted corpuscles, similar to those found in the chyle. The corpuscles are flattened circular discs, measuring about gth of an inch in diameter. Vessels and Nerves. The a/rteries supplying the thymus are derived from the internal mammary, and from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins termi- nate in the left vena innominata, and in the thyroid veins. The lymphatics are of large size, arise in the substance of the gland, and are said to terminate in the internal jugular vein. Sir A. Cooper believed that these vessels carried into the blood the secretion formed in the substance of the thymus. The nerves are exceedingly minute; they are derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. Branches from the descendens noni and phrenic reach the investing capsule, but do not penetrate into the substance of the gland. Chemical Composition. The solid animal constituents of the thymus are albu- men and fibrine in large quantities, gelatine and other animal matters. The salts are alkaline and earthy phosphates, with chloride of potassium. It contains about 80 per cent, of water. Y YThe Urinary Organs. The Kidneys.* 375.—Vertical Section of Kidney. Definition and GuNEEAii Drscription. Tlic kidneys are tlic two largest tubular glands of the body, and are intended for the secretion of urine. They are found at the back part of the abdomen, behind the peritoneum, situated in the lumbar reo-ions ; each kidney extending from the eleventh rib nearly to the crest of the ilium, but the right a little lower than the left, in consequence of the large space occupied by the liver. They are usually imbedded in a considerable quantity of fat, which "principally holds them in position, though they are also to some extent sustained by the large blood-vessels witb which they are connected. Each kidney is about four inches in length, two in breadth, and one in thick- ness, the left being somewhat larger, though thinner, than the right. The weight of the kidney in the adult male varies from 4^ oz. to 6 oz., in the adult female from 4 oz. to 5^ oz., the left being nearly always heavier than the right by about two drachms. "The combined weight of the two kidneys in proportion to the body is about i to 240. The renal substance is of a dark red colour, and dense in texture; but it is easily lacerable under mechanical force. Belations. Each kidney presents for ex- amination two surfaces, two borders, an upper and a lower extremity. The anterior surface is convex and en- tirely covered by peritoneum. It is in relation, on the right side of the body, with the back part of the right lobe of the liver, the descending portion of the duodenum, and the ascending colon; and on the left, with the great end of the stomach, the lower end of the spleen, the tail of the pancreas, and the descending colon. The posterior surface, flatter than the anterior, rests upon the corresponding crus of the diaphragm in front of the eleventh and twelfth ribs, the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis which separates it from the quadratus lum- borum, and on the psoas magnus. The external harder is convex, and directed outwards and slightly forwards towards the parietes of the abdomen. The internal larder, concave, is inter- rupted at its central portion by a notch or 0 .^ ^-a fissure of about an inch in length, called the liilum of the kidney, orens into a hollow cavity called the sim., and through ^V^^IJ^^^;^^ (uvetev) nerves, and lymphatics of the kidney enveloped m fat and cellular tissue Let the Vessels, nerves, diet, and fat be removed so as to leave only the k.dney • This description is from, the pen of my friend Mr. E.

The inferior extremity, directed a little outwards as well as downwards, is smaller than the superior and more flattened ; it extends nearly as low as the crest of the ilium. General stbucttjee of the Kidney. The structure of the kidney, as seen by the naked eye on making a section from its convex to its concave border, will be found to consist of two parts; the glandular portion, or Icidney pro'per, and its excretory duct or ureter* which, latter will be described separately. The Idclney proper presents two distinct parts: the outer or cortical portion, snrrounded by the capsule, and the inner or medullary, which latter is arranged in large conical masses called the pyramids of Malpighi. The capsule is a fibrous coat formed of dense areolar tissue. It is thin and smooth and easily removed from the cortical structure, to which it is connected only by small blood-vessels and by numerous fine fibrous processes continuous with the connective tissue of the kidney. At the hilum it is reflected inwards so * In this section the two first portions of the duct are alone seen. Tliese ave usually called the calices and pelvis of the kidnn/ ■ hut inasnuich as they are really part of the urder, they will be described under that head.

The cortical structure is of a reddish-brown colour, soft, granular, and easily lacerable. It is found everywhere immediately beneath the capsule, and is seen to extend itself in an arched form over each medullary pyramid. The pai-t sepa- rating the sides of any two pyramids, through which the arteries and nerves enter and the veins and lymphatics emerge from the kidney, is called a cortical column, ov coluvm of Berthii, (a, a', fig. 375); whilst tliat portion which stretches from one cortical column to the next, and intervenes between the base of the pyramid and the capsule, which is marked by the dotted line, extending from A to A' (fig. 375), is called a cor- t,77-—I^Iinute Structure of ticul arch, the depth of which varies from a third Kidney, to half an inch. The cortical structure is composed of convoluted and straight tubes called tubuli uri- niferi; of blood-vessels, uerves, and lymphatics; and also of numerous little red masses disseminated throughout its substance known as the Malpighian bodies. These bodies, with the interstitial tissue connecting them, will be described under the head of the ' Minute Structure of the Kidney.' The medullarij sirticture, as before said, is seen to consist of palish-red coloured striated conical masses, the pyramids of Malpighi; the number of ■which, varying from eight to eighteen, corresponds to the number of lohes of which the organ in the fcetal state is composed. The hase of each pyramid is surrounded by a cortical arch and directed towards the circumference of the kidney ; the sides are contiguous with the cortical columns ; whilst the apex, known both as the papilla or mamilla of the kidney, is covered by mucous membrane and is seen projecting into one of the calices of the ureter. , 1 e In addition to the arteries and veins and the ' looped tubes of Henle, hereafter to be described, each pyramid is composed of a large number of straight uriniferous tubes passing from base to apex, and which, by repeated inosculations at very acute angles, are reduced to a comparatively small number, and terminate m open mouths on the mucous surface of the mamilla. Minute structure of the Kidney. Under this head the Malpighian bodies will be first described ; then the course and structure of the tubuli uriniferi; and lastly, the blood-vessels, nerves, lymphptics, and connective tissue or intertubular stroma. The Malpiqhian bodies are small rounded masses averaging ^th of an inch m diameter, of a deep red colour, found only in the cortical structure of the kidney ; being scattered throughout the columns of Bertini, but regularly disposed ui double rows in the cortical arches. Each of these httle bodies is composed of two parts • a central glomerulus of vessels called a Malpighian tuft, and a membranous envelope, the Malpighimi capsule, which latter is a smaU pouch-like commence- ment of a uriniferous tubule.* The Malpighian tuft, or vascular glomerulus, consists of the ramifications ot certain small "vessels termed afferent and efferent renals, the latter being usually smaller than the former. Each renal <f ferent in the cortical arches is derived from an interlobular artery (fig. 378), but in the cortical colnmvs it springs from one of the arterial proprias renales (fig. 385). Having pierced the capsule, usual y at a point opposite to the commencing tubule (figs. 377, 378), it divides m a radiatmg or tult- like manner into several terminal branches, which ultimately inosculate so as to form » In former editions of this work, the Malpighian cnpsulc was said to be found a/ Mc side aBweU rthe of a'tubulc ((/erlacb) ; only the latter position, lunvc^c., is now recognised in the human subject.693 THE KIDNEYS. 378._l)iagrammatlc Repveseutntion of the Blood-vessels in the Siibstimce of the Cortex of the Kidney. a notwovk of eapilladcB f.o.n wbicU the efferent arises (^/J, fig 378)._ Tins latter ves makes its egress from the capsule near to the point whei-e the aiierent enters ; xesseimaktb i ^^^^^^ anastomosing with other effer- ents from other tufts, contributes to form a dense venous fhxus around the urinary tubes adjacent (shown below m in Og. 378). The Malpifjldau cajjsiile, which sur- rounds the glomerulus, is formed of homogeneous membrane, thicker here than at any other part of the tube. It is pierced at a point usually opposite the centre of the tubule, with which it is continuous, by the afferent and efferent renals, and is hned upon its inner sur- face by a delicate layer of either cubical or squamous epithelium ; but as regards this layer, whether it is prolonged over the tuft either in whole or in part, there is a diversity of opinion among many of the most eminent observers. According to Henle, Ecker, and Bow- man, it is not reflected upon the tuft at all, so that the latter hangs free and imcovered in the interior of the capsule (fig- 379-^) ; °^ other hand, Gerlach, Isaachs, Moleschott, and Chrzonszezewsky assert that it can be traced upon the whole of the tuft, and that the cells are even larger and better marked than those upon 711.

In the frog, the cells lining the interior of the capsule, near its junction with the tube, are provided with cilia, but in the human subject their presence has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The Tuhuli Uriniferi: their course. The tubuli uriniferi commence as Mal- phighian capsules, and soon after their origin have an average diameter of ^i^yth of an inch. Thus arising, they pass in so convoluted a manner throughout the cortical substance as to merit the name of tithuU coiitorti. Many of them, according to Henle, soon after their commencement, suddenly become smaller and straighter, and, dipping down to a variable depth in the medullary structure, and returning from thence somewhat larger, re-enter the cortical.

The ascending limbs having arrived at the cortical structure, become again convoluted, and, together with those of the tubuli contorti which have not entered into the loops, end in the straight tubes, or tubuli recti, next to be described. Each straight, otherwise called a collecting or receiving tube, commences at about one line from the surface of the kidney by the coalescence of two or more of the convoluted tubes above men- tioned. Passing towards the rueduUary substance, it continues to receive on either side more con- voluted tubes, until at length it enters a pyramid of Malpighi, where it joins at very acute angles with receiving tubes similarly formed, and finally terminates by an opening at the mamillary apex, emptying its contents into the calyx adjacent. According to Huschke there are about a thousand straight tubes opening upon the apex of each pyramid, but their number is estimated by Kolliker at about five hundred. It will be seen from the above description, that eacli of the straight tubes whilst in the cortical structure is surrounded by numerous tubuli con- torti; and hence,, that a kind of pyramid is formed ; the apex of which consists of the tubulus rectus as it enters the Malpigliian pyramid, wliilst the base, composed of the commencing straight tube with the tubuli contorti from which 38r.

Henco although tho two hmbs of Henle's loops vary much in size, their hare is almost similar, owing to the difl'erent tliickness of their epithelial lining. The Renal Blood-vessels : their origin, course, and distribution. The kidney is plentifully supplied with blood by the renal artery, a large offset of the abdominal ivorta, wliich enters tho sinus tlirough the hilum, dividing in its passage through the latter into four or five branches. These, whilst in the sinus, give off a few twigs for tho nutrition of the surrounding tissues, and terminate in the arierice propriie renales, which enter the kidney proper in the columns of Bertini. Two of these pass to each pyramid of Malpighi and run along its sides for its entire length, giving off as they advance the afferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies in the columns. Having arrived at the bases of the pyramids, they make a bend in their course, so as to lie between the bases of the pyramids and the cortical arches, where they break up into two distinct sets of branches devoted to the supply of the re- maining portions of the kidney. The first set, the interlobular arteries (figs. 385, 386, b), are given off at I'ight angles from the side of the arterise propriae renales looking towards the 385.—Diaf^i-ainniatical Sketch ctf Kidney. 386.—A portion of fig. 385 enlarged.

In their outward course they support the Malpighian bodies by supplying them with afferent vessels, which, having pierced the capsules, end in the Malpi- ghian tufts. From each tuft the corresponding renal efferent arises, which, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent entered, anastomoses with other efferents from other tufts, and conti-ibutes to form a dense -venoios jolexios around the urinary tubes adjacent. The second set from the arterire proprioe renales are for the supply of the medullary pyramids, which they enter at their bases; and passing through their substance straight to their apices, terminate in the venous plexuses found m that situation. They are called the arteriolce rectce. (figs. 385, 386, f). The lienal Veins arise from three sources : the veins beneath the capsule, theURETERS.

In this cavity they inosculate with the corresponding veins from the other pyramids to form The Renal Vein, which, passing through the hilum, opens into the vena cava inferior; the left being longer than the right, from having to cross in fi-ont of the abdominal aorta. Nerves of the Kidney. The nerves of the kidney although small, are about fifteen in number. They have small ganglia developed upon them and are derived from the solar plexus, the lower and outer part of the semilunar ganglion, and fi-om the lesser and smallest splanchnic nerves. They communicate with the spermatic plexus, a circumstance which may explain the sympathy that exists between the kidney and testicle. So far as they have been traced, they seem to accompany the renal artery and its branches, but their exact mode of termination is not known. The lymphatics consist of a superficial and deep set which terminate in the lumbar glands. Connective tissue, or intertuhular stroma. Although the tubules and vessels are closely packed, a certain small amount of connective tissue, continuous with the capsule, binds them firmly together. This tissue was first described by Goodsir and subsequently by Bowman. Ludwig and Zawarykin have observed distinct fibres passing around the Malpighian bodies ; and Henle has seen them between the straight tubes composing the medullary structure. The Ureters, The term Ureter is generally restricted to that portion of the renal duct which is between the pelvis of the kidney and the bladder, but in this description the calices and pelvis of the kidney will be included in its composition. So that the ureter, or excretory duct, of the kidney will be said to consist of three portions: its cuplike commencements, the calices, including the infundibula; its dilated portion, the pelvis ; and its tubular portion, the ureter proper. The calices are cup-like tubes encircling the apices of the Malpighian pyramids ; but inasmuch as one calyx may include two or even more papillse, their number is generally less than the pyramids themselves, the former being from seven to thirteen, whilst the latter vary from eight to eighteen. These cahces converge into the three infundibula, an upper, middle, and lower, which by their junction form the pelvis, or dilated portion of the ureter; which latter, gradually narrowing, becomes continuous with the ureter proper. The portion last mentioned, where the pelvis merges into the ureter proper, is found opposite the transverse process of the third lumbar vertebra on the left, and the fourth on the right side ; at either of which situations it is accessible behind the peritoneum (see fig. 341, p. 633).698 URINARY ORGANS. The ureter proper is a cylindrical membranous tube, from sixteen to eighteen inclies in length, and of the diameter of a goose-quill, extending from the pelvis of the kidney to the bladder. Its course is obliquely downwards and inwards through the lumbar region into the cavity of the pelvis, whei*e it passes downwards, forwards, and inwards across that cavity to the base of the bladder, into which it then opens by a constricted orifice, after having passed obUquely for neai-ly an inch between its muscular and mucous coats. Belations of the ureter proper. In its course it rests upon the psoas muscle, being covered by the peritoneum, and crossed obliquely, from within outwards, by the spermatic vessels ; the right ureter lying close to the outer side of the inferior vena cava. Opposite the first piece of the sacrum it crosses the common iliac artery, lying behind the ileum on the right side and the sigmoid flexure of the colon on the left. In the pelvis it enters the posterior false ligament of the bladder, below the obliterated hypogastric artery, the vas deferens in the male passing between it and the bladder. In the female the ureter passes along the sides and cervix uteri and upper part of the vagina. At the base of the bladder, it is situated about two inches from its fellow ; lying, in the male, about an inch and a half behind the base of the prostate, at the posterior angle of the trigone. Structure. The ureter is composed of three coats, a fibrous, muscular, and mucous. Th.e fibrous coat is the same throughout the entire length of the duct, being continuous at one end with the capsule of the kidney at the floor of the sinus ; whilst at the other it is lost in the fibrous structure of the bladder. The muscular coat consists of two layers in the calices and pelvis, but of three in the ureter "proper. The external or longitudinal fibres of the calices are lost upon the sides of the mamillas, whilst the internal or circular serve to grasp the medullary structure in the same situation. The three layers found in the ureter proper (two longitudinal with an intervening circular layer) are aU continuous with the muscular fibres of the bladder. The mucous coat is smooth and presents a few longitudinal folds which become eSaced by distension. It is continuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder below, whilst it is prolonged over the mamillse of the kidney above. Its epithelium con- sists principally of the spheroidal variety, but at that portion of the ureter near the bladder it is said to be divided into three layers. The inner layer, that in contact with the urine, is irregular or quadrilateral in shape ; the second or intermediate layer more or less resembles columnar epithelium with irregular extremities; whilst the external or third layer is more or less spheroidal. The arteries supplying the ureter are branches from the renal, spermatic, inter- nal iliac, and inferior vesical. The nerves are derived from the inferior mesenteric, spermatic, and hypogastric plexuses, SUPEAEENAL CaPSULES. The suprarenal capsules are usually classified together with the spleen, thymus and thyroid, under the head of ' ductless glands,' as they have no excretory duct. They are two small flattened glandular bodies, of a yellowish colour, situated at the back part of the abdomen, behind the peritoneum, and immediately in front of the upper part of either kidney ; hence their name. The right one is somewhat triangular in shape, bearing a resemblance to a cocked hat; the left is more semi- lunar, and usually larger and higher than the right. They vary in size in different individuals, being sometimes so small as to be scarcely detected; their usual size is from an inch and a quarter to nearly two inches in length, rather less in width, and from two to three lines in thickness. In weight, they vary from one to two drachms. • ^ -3 ^\ a Belations, The antenor surface is in relation, on the right side, with the nnaerTHE PELVIS. 699 surface of the liver ; and on the left, with the pancreas and spleen The posterior snuace or tae Jivui , •ninnhrao-m opposite the tenth dorsal vertebra. .i^j^ace rests upon the eras of the ^^^^P^^""^ i^^ards.

On makmg a perpendicular section, the g and is seen to consist ot two substances : external or cortical, and internal or medullary. The cortical substance forms the chief part of the organ ; it is of a deep ye ow colour, and consists of narrow columnar masses placed perpendicularly to the surlace. The medullar!; substance is soft, pulpy, and of a dark brown or black colour, hence the name, airabiliary capsules, formerly given to these organs. In the centre is often seen a space formed by the breaking down of the component parts ot the According to the researches of Oesterlen and Mr. Simon, the narrow columnar masses of which the cortical substance is composed measure about y^^th of an iuch in diameter, and consist of small closed parallel tubes of Hmitary membrane containing dotted nuclei, together with much granular matter, oil globules, and nucleated cells. According to Bcker, the apparently tubular canals consist of rows of closed vesicles placed endwise, so as to resemble tubes ; whilst KolKker states, that these vesicles are merely loculi or spaces in the stroma of the organ, having BO limitary membrane, which, from being situated endwise, present the appearance of linear tubes. Nucleated cells exist in large numbers in the suprarenal glands of ruminants, more sparingly in man and other animals, but the granular matter appears to form the chief constituent of the gland ; the granules vary in size, and they present the singular peculiarity of undergoing no change when acted upon by most chemical re-agents. The columnar masses are surrounded by a close capillary network, which runs parallel with them. The medullary substance consists of nuclei and granular matter, uniformly scattered throughout a plexus of minute veins. The arteries supplying the suprarenal capsules are numerous and of large size ; they are derived from the aorta, the phrenic, and the renal; they subdivide into numerous minute branches previous to entering the substance of the gland. The suprarenal vein returns the blood from the medullary venous plexus, and receives several branches from the cortical substance; it opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, on the left side into the renal vein. The lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are exceedingly numerous ; they are derived from the solar and renal plexuses, and, according to Bergmann, from the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves. They have numerous small ganglia developed upon them. THE PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is that part of the general abdominal cavity which is below the level of the hnea ilio-pectinea and the promontory of the sacrum. Boundaries. It is bounded, behind, by the sacrum, the coccyx, and the great sacro-sciatic ligaments; in front and at the sides by the pubes and ischia, covered by the Obturator muscles ; above, it communicates with the cavity of the abdomen ; and below, it is hmited by the Levatores ani and Coccygei muscles, and the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which is reflected from the wall of the pelvis on to the viscera.700 URINARY ORGANS. Contents. Tho viscera contained in this cavity are the ui-inaiy bladdei-, the l"ectum, and some of the generative organs peculiai* to each sex : they are partially covered by the peritoneum, and supplied with blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves. The Bi.adder. The bladder is the reservoir for the ixrine. It is a musculo-membranous sac, situated in the pelvis, behind the pubes, and in front of the rectum in the male, the uterus and vagina intervening between it and that intestine in the female The si lape, position, and relations of tho bladder are greatly influenced by age, sex, and tho degrees of distension of the organ. Durlv.g iiij'anaj, it is conical in shape, and projects above the upper border of tho pubes into the hypogastric region. In the adult, when quite empty and contracted, it is a small triangular sac, placed deeply in tho pelvis, flattened from before backwards, its apex reaching 387-—Vertical Section of Blaiklur, Teuis, and Urethra. Prep «o» as high as the upper border of the symphysis pubis. When slightly distended, it has a rounded form, and partially fills the pelvic cavity; and when greatly dis- tended, it is ovoid in shape, rising into the abdominal cavity, and often extending nearly as high as the umbilicus. It is larger in its vertical diameter than from side to side, and its long axis is dii-ected from above obliquely downwards and backwards, in a line directed from some point between the pubes and umbilicus (according to its distension) to the end of the coccyx. The bladder, when distended, is slightly curved forwards towards the. anterior wall of the abdomen so as to be more convex behind than in front. In the female, it is larger in the transverse than in the vertical diameter, and its capacity is said to be greater than in the male. "When moderately distended, it measures about five inches in length, and three inches across, and the ordinary amount which it contains is about a pint. The bladder is divided into a summit, body, base, and neck. The summit, or apex, of the bladder is rounded and directed forwards andBLAUDKK. 7ot , J , . 1 „ „„,i^,-Uf.nq bv a fibro-muscular cord, the uraclius, upwards ; it is connoc ed-to ^^^^7f ^'/^"^^^^Jds, the obliterated portions of the aud also by means of two rounded ^^'ous cmds the urachus.

The posterior surface is covered by peritoneum througliout. It corresponds, m the male, with the rectum ; in the female, with the uterus, some convolutions ot the small intestine being interposed. , j p n The side of the bladder is crossed obliquely from below, upwards and forwards, by the obliterated hypogastric artery : above and behind this cord, the bladder is covered by peritoneum; but below and in front of it the serous covenng is wanting, and it is connected to the pelvic fascia. The vas deferens passes, m an arched direction, from before backwards, along the side of the bladder, towards its base, crossing in its course the obliterated hypogastric artery, and passing along the inner side of the ureter. The hase {fundus) of the bladder is directed downwards and backwards. It varies in extent according to the state of distension of the organ, being very broad when full, but much narrower when empty. In the male, it rests upon the second portion of the rectum, from which it is separated by a reflection of the recto-vesical fascia. It is covered posteriorly, for a slight extent, by the peritoneum, which is reflected fi-om it upon the rectum, forming the recto-vesical fold. The portion of the bladder in relation with the rectum corresponds to a triangular space, bounded behind by the recto-vesical fold ; on either side, by the vesicnla seminalis and vas deferens ; and touching the prostate gland in front. When the bladder is very full, the peritoneal fold is raised with it, and the distance between its reflection and the anus is about four inches; but this dis- tance is much diminished when the bladder is empty and contracted. In the female, the base of the bladder lies in contact with the lower part of the cervix uteri, is adherent to the anterior wall of tlie vagina, and separated from the upper part of the anterior surface of the cervix uteri by a fold of the peritoneum. The neclc (cervix) of the bladder is the constricted portion continuous with the urethra. In the male, its direction is oblique in the erect posture, and it is sur- rounded by the prostate gland. In the female, its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards. Ligaments. The bladder is retained in its place by ligaments which are divided into true and false. The true ligaments are five in number, two anterior, and two lateral, formed by the recto-vesical fascia, aud the urachus. The false ligaments, also five in number, are formed by folds of the peritoneum. The anterior ligaments (fuho-prostatic) extend from the back of the pubes, one on each side of the symphysis, to the front of the neck of the bladder, and upper surface of the prostate gland. These ligaments contain a few muscular fibres prolonged from the bladder. The lateral ligaments, broader and thinner than the preceding, are attached to the lateral parts of the prostate, and to the sides of the base of the bladder. The urachus is the fibro-muscular cord already mentioned, extending between the summit of the bladder and the umbilicus. It is broad below, at its attachment to the bladder, and becomes narrower as it ascends.702 URINARY ORGANS. Tho false ligaments of the bladder aro, two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The two posterior pass forwards, in the male, from the sides of the rectum ; in the female, from tho sides of the uterus, to the posterior and lateral aspect of the bladder : they form the lateral boundaries of the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum, and contain the obliterated hypogastric arteries, and tho ureters, beside vessels and nerves. The two lateral ligaments are reflections of the peritoneum, from the iliac fossa) to the sides of the bladder. The superior ligament is the prominent fold of peritoneum extending from the summit of the bladder to the umbilicus. It covers the urachus, and the obliterated hypogastric arteries. Structure. The bladder is composed of four coats: a serous, a muscular, a cellular, and a mucous coat. The scroiLs coat is partial, and derived from the peritoneum. It invests the posterior surface, from opposite the termination of the two ureters to its summit, and is reflected from this point and from the sides, on to the abdominal and pelvic walls. The muscitlar coat consists of two layers of unstriped muscular fibre, an external layer, composed of longitudinal fibres, and an internal layer of circular fibres. The longitudinal fibres are most distinct on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the organ. They arise in front, from the anterior ligaments of the bladder, from the neck of the bladder, and, in the male, from the adjacent portion of the prostate gland. They spread out, and form a plexiform mesh, on the anterior surface of the bladder, being continued over the posterior surface, and base of the organ of the neck, where they are inserted into the prostate, in the male, and into the vagina in the female. Other longitudinal fibres arise, in the male, from the sides of the prostate, and spread out upon the sides of the bladder, intersecting with one another. The circular fibres are very thinly and irregularly scattered on the body of the organ; but, towards its lower part, round the cervix and commencement of the urethra, they are disposed as a thick circular layer, forming the sphincter vesica, which is continuous with the muscular fibres of the prostate gland. Two bands of oblique fibres, originating behind the orifices of the ureters, converge to the back part of the prostate gland, and are inserted, by means of a fibrous process, into the middle lobe of that organ. They are the mmcles of the meters, described by Sir C. Bell, who supposed that, during the contraction of the bladder, they served to retain the oblique direction of the ureters, and so prevent the reflux of the urine into them. J. B. Pettigrew gives the following results at which he has arrived by his exquisite dissections of the muscular fibres of the bladder and prostate (Phil. Trans. 1867). The muscular fibres of the bladder are arranged spirally, fnrming figure-of-8 loops, the superficial more longitudinal or drawn out, the deeper more circular or flattened. This arrangement has been aptly compared to that of india-rubber riugs through which a stick has been passed and which are then wound twice round the stick and drawn out into figures-of-8, some (the exterior) in very elongated loops, so as to approach the longitudinal direction, others (the central) in very flattened loops, so as to be nearly circulai". The external fibres, which are nearly longitudinal, are in four sets—an anterior and posterior, and a right and left lateral; the latter accessory and less fully developed. The fibres are arranged in seven strata, three external, three internal, and a middle, pursuing well-marked directions in each. These layers, however, are very imperfect,' the fibres rarely, if ever, occupying precisely the same plane and running exactly parallel. They, moreover, split up, and become fused with each other, with corresponding or homologous fibres, and with fibres which are either superimposed or underlie them.' The fibres of the first and seventh layers are the most feebly developed. The crossings or decussations of the loops occur at different distances in pro- ceeding from before backwards, this crossing forming a kind of spiral line. Tiie loops are directed towards and embrace tlie urachus and urethra respectively. The terminal ex- pansions of the loops in the otlier layers contribute to the formation of the fourth layer, particularly triwards the base and apex, which are, therefore, thicker than the other parts. The aggregation of the loops towards the apex forms the sphincter. The longitudinal, slightly703 BLADDER. are all continued oblique, unuy ooiuiu.-, - rerrarded as a continuation of tho bladder into the prostatic urethra, which V^ereloie ina} -^^^ vernmontanum, which Petti-row anteriorly.

Coicpej^a GlaiKi^ Orlfteeif of fluet*. is a triangular, smooth surface, the apex of which is directed forwards; this is the trigonum vesica, or trigone vesicale. It is paler in colour than the rest of the mucous membrane, and never presents any .rugae, even in the collapsed condition of the organ, owing to its intimate adhesion to the sub- jacent tissues. It is bounded on each side by two slight ridges, which pass backwards and outwards to the orifices of the ureters, and correspond with the muscles of these tubes; and at each posterior angle, by the orifices of the ureters, which are placed nearly two inches from each other, and about an inch and a half behind the orifice of the urethra. The trigone corre- sponds with the interval at the base of the bladder, bounded by the prostate in front, and the vesiculae and vasa deferentia on the sides. Projecting from the lower and anterior part of the bladder, into the orifice of the uretln-a, is a slight elevation of mucous mem- brane, called the uvula vesicce. It is formed by a thickening of the prostate. The arteries supplying the bladder are the superior, middle, and infenor vesical, in the male, with additional branchesfromtheuterine,in the female. They are all derived from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac. The veins form a complicated plexus round the neck, sides, and base of the bladder, and terminate in the internal iliac vein.URINARY ORGANS. The liimfhaties accompany tlio blood-vessels, passing through the glands surrounding them. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric and sacral plexuses ; the former supplying the upper part of the organ, the latter its base and neck. Male Uiiethua. The urethra extends from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It presents a double curve in the flaccid state of the penis, but in the erect state it forms only a single curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards (fig. 387). Its length varies from eight to nine inches ; and it is divided into three portions, the prostatic, membranous, and spongy, the structure and relations of which are essentially different. The Prostatic, portion is the widest and most dilatable part of the canal. It passes through the prostate gland, from its base to the apex, lying nearer its upper than its lower surface. It is about an inch and a quarter in length; the form of the canal is spindle-shaped, being wider in the middle than at either extremity and nan'owest in front, where it joins the membranous portion. A transver.se section of the canal in this situation is triangular, the apex directed downwards. Upon the floor of the canal is a narrow longitudinal ridge, the verumontanum, or caput gallinaginis, formed by an elevation of the mucous membrane and its subjacent tissue. It is eight or nine lines in length, and a line and a half in height; and contains, according to Kobelt, muscular and erectile tissues. When distended, it may serve to prevent the passage of the semen backw^ards into the bladder. On each side of the verumontanum is a slightly depressed fossa, the prostatic sinus, the floor of ■which is perforated by numerous apertures, the orifices of the prostatic ducts, the ducts of the middle lobe opening behind the crest. At the fore part of the verumontanum, in the middle line, is a depression, the sinus ^ocularis (yesictda prostatica) ; and upon or within its margins are the slit-like openings of the ejaculatory ducts. The sinus pocularis forms a cul-de-sac about a quarter of an inch in length, which runs upwai-ds and backwards in the substance of the prostate beneath the middle lobe; its prominent upper wall partly forms the verumontanum. Its walls are composed of fibrous tissue, muscular fibres, and mucous membrane ; and numerous small glands open on its inner surface. It has been called by Weber, who discovered it, the titerus mascuUnus, from its supposed homology with the female organ. The Meinhranous portion of the urethra extends between the apex of the prostate, and the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. It is the narro\yest part of the canal (excepting the orifice), and measures three-quarters of an inch along its upper and half an inch along its lower surface, in consequence of the bulb projecting back- wards beneath it below. Its upper concave surface is placed about an inch beneath the pubic arch, from which it is separated by the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis, and some muscular fibres. Its lower convex surface is separated from the rectum by a triangular space, which constitutes the perinfBum. The membranous portion of the urethra perforates the deep perineal fascia; and two layers from this membrane are prolonged round it, the one forwards, the other backwards; it is also surrounded by the Compressor urethra muscle. Its coverings are mucous membrane, elastic fibrous tissue, a thin layer of erectile tissue, muscular fibres, and a prolongation from the deep perinasal fascia. The Spongy portion is the longest part of the urethra, and is contained in the corpus spongiosum. It is about six inches in length, and extends from the ter- mination of the membranous portion to tho meatus urinarius. Commencing below the symphysis pubis, it ascends for a short distance, and then curves downward.-^. It is narrow, and of uniform size in the body of the penis, measuring about a quarter of an inch in diameter; being dilated behind, within the bulb; and again anteriorly within the glans penis, forming the fossa naviculars. A cross section of this canal in tho body of the penis has its long diameter transvei-se ; but in the glans, t hat diameter is directed vertically.URETHRA. 705 The Bulbous portion is a name given, in some descviptions of the urethra, to the posterior dilated part of the spo^igy portion contained within the bulb. _ The vreatus urinarkcs is the most contracted part of the urethra ; it is a vertical slit, about three lines in length, bounded on each side by two small labia. The inner surface of the lining membrane of the urethra, especially on the Aoo^ c.f the spongy portion, presents the orifices of numerous mucous glands and follicles, situated in the submucous tissue, and named the glands of Littre ihey vary m size, and their oriBces are directed forwards, so that they may easily intercept the point of a catheter in its passage along the canal. One of these lacnnsj larger than the rest, is situated on the upper surface of the fossa navicularis, about an inch and a half from the orifice; it is called the lacuna magna. Into the bulbous portion are found opening the ducts of Cowper's glands. Stnicture. The urethra is composed of three coats : a mucous, muscular, and erectile. . The mucous coat forms part of the genito-urinary mucous membrane. It is continuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys; externally, with the integument covering the glans penis; and is prolonged into the ducts of the glands which open into the urethra, viz., Cowper's glands, the prostate gland, and the vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales, through the ejaculatoi-y ducts. In the spongy and membranous portions the mucous membrane is arranged in longitudinal folds when the organ is contracted. Small papillae are found upon it, near the orifice; and its epithelial lining is of the columnar variety, excepting near the meatus, where it is laminated. The muscular coat consists of two layers of plain muscular fibres, an external longitudinal layer, and an internal circular. The muscular tissue is most abundant in the prostatic portion of the canal. A thin layer of erectile tissue is continued from the corpus spongiosum round the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra to the neck of the bladder.Male Generative Organs. Prostate Gland. THE Prostate Gland {iT{H>iarmii, to stand before), is a pale, firm, glandular body, whicli surrounds the neck of the bladder and commencement of the urethra. It is placed in the pelvic cavity, behind and below the symphysis pubis, posterior to the deep perineal fascia, and upon the rectum, through which it may be distinctly felt, especially when enlarged. In shape and size it resembles a liorse-chestnnt. Its base is directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder. The apex is directed forwards to the deep perinasal fascia, which it touches. Its imder surface is smooth, and rests on the rectum, to which it is connected by dense areolar fibrous tissue. Its upper surface is flattened, marked by a slight longitudinal furrow, and placed about three-quarters of an inch below the pubic symphysis. It measures about an inch and a half in its transverse diameter at the base, an inch in its antero-posterior diameter, and three-quarters of an inch in depth. Its weight is about six drachms. It is held in its position by the anterior ligaments of the bladder (pubo-prastatic) ; by the posterior layer of the deep perinasal fascia, which invests the commencement of the membranous portion of the urethra and prostate gland; and by the anterior portion of the Levator ani muscle (levator jprostofce)^ which passes down on each side from the symphysis pubis and anterior ligament of the bladder to the sides of the prostate. The prostate consists of three lobes : two lateral and a middle lobe. The two lateral lobes are of equal size, separated behind by a deep notch, and marked by a slight furrow upon their upper and lower surface, which indicates the H-lobed condition of the organ in some animals. The third, or middle lobe, is a small transverse band, occasionally a rounded or triangular prominence, placed between the two lateral lobes, at the under and posterior part of the organ. It Hes immediately beneath the neck of the bladder, behind the commencement of the urethra, and above the ejaculatory ducts. Its existence is not constant; but it is occasionally found at an early period of life, as well as in adults, and in old age. In advanced life this, or some other portion of the prostate, often becomes considerably enlarged, and projects into the bladder, so as to impede the passage of the urine. According to Dr. Messer's researches, conducted at Greenwich Hospital,* it would seem that such obstruction exists in 20 per cent, of all prostates over sixty years of age. The prostate gland is perforated by the urethra and common semmal ducts. The urethra usually lies about one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface ; occasionally the prostate surrounds only the lower three-fourths of this tube, and more rarely'the urethra runs through the lower instead of the upper part of the dand The ejaculatory ducts pass forwards obliquely through a corneal canal, situated in the lower pai-t of the prostate, and open into the prostatic portion of the urethra. . , „ i j- i- 1. Structure The prostate is enclosed in a thm but firm fibrous capsule, distinct from that derived from the posterior layer of the deep perinatal fascia, and separated from it by a plexus of veins. Its gubstance is of a pale reddish-grey colour, very friable, but of great density. It consists of glandular substance and muscular tissue. „ „. , ^ The alandular substance is composed of numerous follicular pouches, openmg into elongated canals, which join to form from-twelve to twenty small excretory diirts The follicles are connected together by areolar tissue, supported by pro- longations from the fibrous capsule, and enclosed in a delicate capillary plexus. * Med. Chir. Trans, vol. xliii. p. 152.PENIS. 707 The epithelium lining the canals is columnar, whilst that in the terminal vesicles is of the squamous variety. • . Them War tissue oi the prostate is arranged in the form of circular bands round the urethra; it is continuous behind with the cu-cular fibres of the sphincter vesica3, and in fi-ont with the circular fibres of the urethra. The muscular fibi-es are of the involuntary kind. The prostatic ducts open into the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra. j • j .p +1 Vessels and Nerves. The artenes supplying the prostate are derived Ironi the internal pudic, vesical, and hismorrhoidal. Its veins form a plexus around^ the sides and base of the gland; tliey communicate in front with the dorsal vein ot the penis, and terminate in the internal iliac vein. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. The Prosiatic Secretion is a milky fluid, having an acid reaction, and presenting, on microscopic examination, molecular matter, the squamous and coliimnar forms of epithelium, and granular nuclei. In old age, this gland is liable to be enlarged, and its ducts are often filled with innumerable small concretions, of a brownish- red colour, and of the size of a millet seed, composed of carbonate of Hme and animal matter. Cowpee's Glands. Conner's Glands are two small rounded and somewhat lobulated bodies, of a yellowish colour, about the size of peas, placed beneath the fore part of the mem- branous portion of the urethra, between ths two layers of the deep perinasal fascia. They lie close behind the bulb, and are enclosed by the transverse fibres of the Compressor urethrse muscle. Each gland consists of several lobules, held together by a fibrous investment. The excretory duct of each gland, nearly an inch in length, passes obliquely forwards beneath the mucous membrane, and opens by a minute orifice on the floor of the bulbous portion of the urethra. Their existence is said to be constant; they gradually diminish in size as age advances. The Penis, The penis is the organ of copulation, and contains in its interior the larger portion of the urethra. It consists of a root, body, and extremity or glans penis. The root is broad, and firmly connected to the rami of the pubes by two strong tapering fibrous processes, the crura, and to the front of the symphysis pubis by a fibrous membrane, the suspensory ligament. The extremity, or gkms penis, presents the form of an obtuse cone, flattened from above downwards. At its summit is a vertical fissure, the orifice of the urethra (meatus urinarius) : at the back part of this orifice a fold of mucous membrane passes backwards to the bottom of a depressed raphe, where it is continuous with the prepuce ; this fold is termed the frcenvm preputii. The base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona glandis ; and behind the corona is a deep constriction, the cervix. Upon both of these numerous small lenticular sebaceous glands are found, the glandulce Tysonii, odoriferce. They secrete a seba- ceous matter of very peculiar odour, which probably contains caseine, and becomes easily decomposed. The lady of the penis is the part between the root and extremity. In the flaccid condition of the organ it is cylindrical, but when erect has a triangular prismatic form with rounded angles, the broadest side being turned upwards, and called the dorstm.. It is covered by integument remarkable for its thinness, its dark colour, its looseness of connexion with the deeper parts of the organ, and its containing no adipose tissue. At the root of the penis the integument is continuous with that upon the pubes and scrotum; and at the neck of the glans it leaves the surface, and becomes folded upon itself to form the prepuce. The internal layer of the prepuce, which also becomes attached to the cervix, approaches in character to a mucous membrane ; it is reflected over the glans penis, and at the meatus urinarius is continuous with the mucous lining of the urethra. z z 27o8 MALE GENERATIVK ORGANS Tito mucous membrane covering the glans penis contains no sebaceous glands; but projecting from its free surface are a number of small highly sensitive papilla). The penis is composed of a mass of erectile tissue, enclosed in three cylindrical fibrous compartments. Of these, two, the corpora cavernosa, are placed side by side along the upper part of the organ; the third, or corpus spongiosum, encloses the ui-efchra, and is placed below. The Gor2wra Cavernosa form the chief pai^t of the body of the penis. They consist of two iibrous cylindrical tabes, placed side by side, and intimately con- nected along the median line for their anterior three-fourths, their posterior fourth being separated to form the two crura, by which the penis is connected to the ' rami°of the pubes. Each crus commences by a blunt-pointed process in front of the tuberosity of the ischium ; and, near its junction with its fellow, presents a shght enlargement, named, by Kobelt, the bulb of the corpus cavernasum. Just beyond this point they become constricted, and retain an equal diameter to their anterior extremity, where they form a single rounded end, which is received into a fossa in the base of the glans penis. A median groove on the upper surface lodges the dorsal vein of the penis, and the groove on the under surface receives the corpus spongiosum. The root of the penis is connected to the symphysis pubis by the suspensory ligament. Structure. Each corpus cavernosum consists of a strong fibrous envelope, enclosing a fibrous reticular structure, which contains erectile tissue in its meshes. It is separated from its fellow by an incomplete fibrous septum. The fibrous investment is extremely dense, of considerable thickness, and highly elastic ; it not only invests the surface of the organ, but sends oS numerous fibrous bands (trabeculce) from its inner surface, as well as from the surface of the septum, which cross its interior in all directions, subdividing it into a number of separate compartments, which present a spongy structure, in which the erectile tissue is contained. The trabecular structure fiUs the interior of the corpora cavernosa, its com- ponent fibres are larger and stronger round the circumference than at the centre of the corpora cavernosa ; they are also thicker behind than in front. The inter- spaces on the contrary, are larger at the centre than at the circumference, their long diameter being directed transversely ; and they are largest anteriorly. They are lined by a layer of squamous epithelium. The fibrous septum forms an imperfect partition between the two corpora caver- nosa ■ it is thick and complete behind ; but in front it is incomplete, and consists of a number of vertical bands of fibrous tissue, which are aiTanged like the teeth of a comb, hence the name, septum fectimforme ; these bands extend between the dorsal and'the urethral surface of the corpora cavernosa. ^ , The fibrous investment and septum consist of longitudinal bands of white fibrous tissue with numerous elastic and muscular fibres. The trabeculce also consist of white' fibrous tissue, elastic fibres, and plain muscular fibres, and enclose arteries and nerves. . , n ■ .i The Corpus Spongiosum encloses the urethra, and is situated m the groove on the under surface of the corpora cavernosa. It commences posteriorly m front of the deep pcrinceal fascia, between the diverging crura of the corpora cavernosa, where it forms a rounded enlargement, the bulb; and terminates, anteriorly, m another expansion, the glans penis, which overlaps the anterior rounded extremity of the corpora cavernosa. The central portion, or body of the corpus spongiosum, is cvlindrical, and tapers slightly from behind forwards. • ^ . The bulb varies in size in dittcrent subjects ; it receives a fibrous investment from the anterior layer of the deep perins«al fascia, and is surrounded by the Accelerator urinse muscle. The urethra enters the bulb nearer its upper than its Ler surface, being surrounded by a layer of erectile tissue, a thm prolongation of which is continued backwards round the membranous and prostatic portions of The canal to the neck of the bladder, lying immediately beneath the mucousCOVERINGS OF TESTIS. 709 membrane The portion of the bulb below the nretlira presents a partial division into two lobes, being marked externally by a linear raphe, whilst internally there projects inwards, for a short distance, a thin fibrous septum, more distmct m early Structure. The corpus spongiosum consists of a strong fibrous envelope, enclosing a trabecular structure, which contains in its meshes erectile tissue, ihe fabrous envelope is thinner, whiter in colour, and more elastic than that of the corpus cavernosum. The trabeculte are delicate, uniform in size, and the meshes between them small ; their long diameter, for the most part, corresponding with that o the penis. A thin layer of muscular fibres, continuous behind with those of the bladder, forms part of the outer coat of the corpus spongiosum. ' The erectih tissue consists essentially of an intricate venous plexus, lodged in the interspaces between the trabeculte. The veins forming this plexus are so numerous, and communicate so freely with one another, as to present a cellular appearance when examined by means of a section; their walls are extremely thin, and Imed by squamous epithelium. The veins are smaller in the glans penis, corpus spongiosum, and circumference of the corpora cavernosa, than in the central part of the latter, where they are of large size, and much dilated. They return the blood by a series of vessels, some of which emerge in considerable numbers fi-om the base of the glans penis, and converge on the dorsum of the organ to form the dorsal vein ; others pass out on the upper surface of the corpora cavernosa, and join the dorsal vein; some emerge fi'om the under surface of the corpora cavernosa, and, receiving branches from the corpus spongiosum, wind round the sides of the penis to terminate in the dorsal vein ; but the greater number pass out at the root of the penis, and join the prostatic plexus and pudendal veins. The arteries of the penis are derived from the internal pudic. Those supplying the corpora cavernosa are the arteries of the corpora cavernosa, and branches from the dorsal artery of the penis, which perforate the fibrous capsule near the fore part of the organ. Those to the corpus spongiosum are the arteries of the bulb. Additional branches are described by Kobelt as arising from the trunk of the internal pudic ; they enter the bulbous enlargements on the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. The arteries, on entering the cavernous structure, divide into branches, which are supported and enclosed by the trabeculse ; according to Miiller, some of these branches terminate in a capillary network, wliich communicates with the veins as in other parts ; whilst others are more convoluted, and assume a tendril-like appearance; hence the name,-/teMcms arteries, which is given to these vessels. The helicine arteries are more abundant in the back part of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum ; they have not been seen in the glans penis. They are small twigs, given off in bunches from the sides of the arteries as they lie on the trabeculEe, and they terminate in dilated extremities hanging down into the cavity of a vein. Whether the extremities of the twigs are open or closed appears uncertain. The existence of these vessels is denied by Valentin, who describes the smallest branches of the arteries as terminating by wide, funnel- shaped orifices, which open dii-ectly into the venous cavities. The lymphatics of the penis consist of a superficial and deep set; the former terminate in the inguinal glands ; the latter emerge from the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, and, passing beneath the pubic arch, join the deep lym- phatics of the pelvis. The nerves art; derived from the internal pudic nerve and the hypogastric plexus On the glans and bulb some filaments of the cutaneous nerves have Pacinian bodies connected with them. The Testes and their Coverings. The testes are two smaU glandular organs, which secrete the semen ; they are situated in the scrotum, being suspended by the spermatic cords. At an early period of foetal life, the testes are contained in the abdominal cavity, behind the pentoueum. Before birth, they descend to the inguinal canal, along which they7IO MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS. pass with the spermatic cord, and, omorging at the external abdominal ring, they descend into tlie scrotum, becoming invested in their course by numerous coverings derived from the serous, muscular, and fibrous layers of the abdominal parietes, as well as by the scrotum. The coverings of the testis are, the Sl^i" \ Scrotum. Dartos J Intcrcolumnar, or External speruaatic fascia. 0remaster muscle. Infundibuliform, or Fascia propria (Internal spermatic fascia). Tunica vaginalis. The SCKOTUM is a cutaneous pouch, which contains the testes and part of the spermatic cords. It is divided into two lateral halves, by a median line, or raphe, which is continued forwards to the under surface of the penis, and backwards along the middle line of the perinroum to the anus. Of these two lateral portions, the left is longer than the right, and corresponds with the greater length of the spermatic cord on the left side. Its external aspect varies under diflferent cir- cumstances : thus, under the influence of warmth, and in old and debilitated persons, it becomes elongated and flaccid; but, under the influence of cold, and in the young and robust, it is short, corrugated, and closely applied to the testes. The scrotum consists of two layers, the integument and the dartos. The integument is very thin, of a brownish colour, and generally thrown mto folds or rugse. It is provided with sebaceous folHcles, the secretion of which has a peculiar odour, and is beset with thinly scattered, crisp hairs, the roots of which are seen through the skin. • The darlos is a thin layer of loose reddish tissue, endowed with contractility; it forms the proper tunic of the scrotum, is continuous, around the base of the scrotum with the superficial fascia of the groin, perina!um, and inner side _ of the thio-hs and sends inwards a distinct septum, septum scroti, which divides it into two cavities for the two testes, the septum extending between the raphe and the under surface of the penis, as far as its root. The dartos is closely united to the skin externally, but connected with the sub- iacent parts by dehcate areolar tissue, upon which it glides with the greatest facihty The dartos is very vascular, and consists of a loose areolar tissue, con- taining unstriped muscular fibre. Its contractHity is slow, and excited by cold and mechanical stimuli, but not by electricity. • n ., The intercolumnar fascia is a thin membrane, derived from the margm ot tlie pillars of the external abdominal ring, during the descent of the testis in the Ltus beino- prolonged downwards around the surface of the cord and testis, it is sepkrated from the dartos by loose areolar tissue, which allows of considerable movement, of the latter upon it, but is intimately connected with the succeeding ^""^The cremasteric fascia consists of scattered bundles of muscular fibres (Cre- master muscle), derived from the lower border of the internal oblique muscle, during the descent of the testis (p. 732). The fctscia propria is a thin membranous layer, which loosely invests the surface of the cord. It is a continuation downwards of the infundibuliform pro- cess of the fascia transversalis, and is also derived during the descent of the testis in the foetus. . „ +_„f:c, a The tunica vaginalis is described with the proper covering of the testis, a more detailed account of the other coverings of the testis will be found m the description of the surgical anatomy of inguinal hernia. n , . i- +1 Vessels and Nerves.

These structures are connected together by areolar tissue, and invested by the fasci£8 brought down by the testicle in its descent. In the abdommal wall the cord passes obliquely along the inguinal canal, lying at first beneath the Internal oblique, and upon the fascia trausversalis ; but nearer the pubes, it rests upon Poupart's ligament, having the aponeurosis of the External oblique m front of it, and the conjoined tendon beliind it. It then escapes at the external ring, and descends nearly vertically into the scrotum. The left cord is rather longer than the right, consequently the left testis hangs somewhat lower than its fellow. The artenes of the cord are : the spermatic, from the aorta; the artery of the vas deferens, from the superior vesical; and the cremasteric, from the epigastric artery. The spermatic artery supplies the testicle. On approaching the gland, it gives off some branches which supply the epididymis, and others which perforate the tunica albuginea behind, and spread out on its inner surface, or pass through the fibrous septum in its interior, to be distributed on the membranous septa between the lobes. The artery of the vas deferens is a long slender vessel, which accompanies the vas deferens, ramifying upon the coats of that duct, and anastomosing with the spermatic artery near the testis. The cremasteric branch from the epigastric supplies the Oremaster muscle, and other coverings of the cord. The spermatic veins leave the back part of the testis, and, receiving branches from the epididymis, unite to form a plexus (^pampiniform plexus), which forms the chief mass of the cord. They pass up in front of the vas deferens, and unite to form a single trunk, which terminates, on the right side, in the inferior vena cava, on the left side, in the left renal vein. The lymphatics are of large size, accompany the blood-vessels, and terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are the spermatic plexus from the sympathetic. This plexus is derived from the renal and aortic plexuses, joined by filaments from the hypogastric plexus, which accompany the artery of the vas deferens. Testes. The testes are suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cords. Each gland is of an oval form, compressed laterally and behind and having an oblique position in the scrotum ; the upper extremity being directed forwards and a little outwards ; the lower, backwards ,and a little inwards ; the anterior convex border looks forwards and downwards, the posterior or straight border, to which the cord is attached, backwards and upwards. The anterior and lateral surfaces, as well as both extremities of the organ, ai-e convex, free, smooth, and invested by the tunica vaginalis. The posterior border, to which the cord is attached, receives only a partial investment from that mem- brane. Lying upon the outer edge of this border, is a long, narroAv, flattened body, named, from its relation to the testis, the epididymis (lilviioQ, testis). It consists of a central portion, or body, an upper enlarged extremity, the glolus major, or head; and a lower pointed extremity, the tail, or cjlohus minor. The globus major is intimately connected with the upper end of the testicle by means of its efferent ducts ; and the globus minor is connected with its lower end by cellular tissue, and a reflection of the tunica vaginalis. The outer surface and upper and lower ends of the epididymis are free and covered by serous mem- brane ; the body is also completely invested by it, excepting along its posteriorMALE GENPIRATIVE ORGANS. 7t2 389.—The Testis in situ. The Tunica Vaginalis liaviug been laid open. litTliea Vaginalis border, and connected to the back of the testis by a fold of the serous mem- brane. Attached to the upper end of the testis, or to the epididymis, is a small pedunculated body, the use of which is unknown. When the testicle is removed from the body, the position of the vas deferens, on its posterior and inner side, marks the side to which tlie gland has belonged. Size and Weight. The average dimen- sions of this gland are from one and a half to two inches in length, one inch in breadth, and an inch and a quarter in the antero-posterior diameter; and the weight varies from six to eight drachms, the left testicle being a little the larger. The testis is invested by three tunics, the tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea, and tunica vasculosa. The Tunica Vaginalis is the serous covering of the testis. It is a pouch of serous membrane, derived from the peri- toneum during the descent of the testis in the foetus, from the abdomen into the scrotum. After its descent, that portion of the pouch which extends from the internal ring to near the upper part of the gland becomes obliterated, the lower portion remaining as a shut sac, which invests the outer surface of the testis, and is reflected on the internal surface of the scrotum ; hence it may be described as consisting of a visceral and parietal portion. The visceral portion (tunica vaginalis propria), covers the outer surface of the testis, as well as the epididymis, connecting the latter to the testis by means of a distinct fold. Erom the posterior border of the gland, it is reflected on to the internal surface of the scrotum. _ x • r. The parietal portion of the serous membrane (tunica vaginalis reflexa), is far more extensive than the visceral portion, extending upwards, for some distance in front, and on the inner side of the cord, and reaching below the testis. The inner surface of the tunica vaginalis is free, smooth, and covered by a layer of squamous epithelium. The interval between the visceral and parietal layers of this membrane constitutes the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. The Ttmica Albuginea is the fibrous covering of the testis. It is a dense fibrous membrane, of a bluish white colour, composed of bundles of white fibrous tissue which interlace in every direction. Its outer surface is covered by the tumca vaginalis except along its posterior border, and at the points of attachment of the epididymis ; hence the tunica albuginea is usually considered as a fibro-serous membrane like the dura mater and pericardium. This membrane surrounds the dandular 'structure of the testicle, and, at its posterior and upper bordei-, is Reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum called the mediastinum testis (corpus Eiglimorianum). , . p The mediasUnum testis extends from the upper, nearly to the lower border ot the gland, and is wider above than below. From the front and sides of this septum numerous slender fibrous cords (traheculce) are given ofi", which pass to be attached to the inner surface of the tunica albuginea : they serve to maintain the form of the testis, and join with similar cords given off" from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, to form spaces which enclose the separate lobules ot the organ. The mediastinum supports the vessels and ducts of the testis m their passage to and from the substance of the gland. The Tunica Vascidosa (pia mater testis), is the vascular layer ot the testis,713 TESTES. 390.—Vertical section of the Tes- ticle, to show the arrangement of the Ducts. consisting of a plexns of blood-vessels, held together by a delicate areolar tissue. Ifc covers the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, sending off numerous processes between the lobules, which are supported by the fibrous prolongations from the mediastinum testis. . , p i 1 i Structure The glandular structure of the testis consists of numerous lobules (lohuU testis). Their number, in a single testis, is estimated by Berres at 250, and by Krause at 400. They differ in size according to their position, those m the middle of the gland being larger and longer. The lobules are conical m shape, the base being directed towards the circumference of the organ, the apex towards the mediastinum. Each lobule is contained in one of the intervals between the fibrous cords and vascular processes, which extend between the mediastinum testis and the tunica albuginea, and consists of from one to three, or more, minute convoluted tubes, the tubuli seminiferi. The tubes may be separately unravelled, by careful dissection under water, and may be seen to com- mence either by free caecal ends, or by anastomotic loops. The total number of tubes is considered by Munro to be about 300, and the length of each about sixteen feet; by Lauth, their number is estimated at 840, and their average length tvyro feet and a quarter. Their diameter varies from Tjigthto tstt^I^ of an inch. The tubuli are pale in colour in early life, but, in old age, they acquii'e a deep yellow tinge, from containing much fatty matter. They consist of a base- ment membrane, lined by epithelium, consisting of nucleated glandular cor- puscles, and are enclosed in a delicate plexus of capillary vessels. In the apices of the lobules, the tubuli become less convoluted, assume a nearly straight course, and unite together to form from twenty to thirty larger ducts, of about ■g^yth of an inch in diameter, and these, from their straight course, are called vasa recta. The vasa recta enter the fibrous tissue of the mediastinum, and pass upwards and backwards, forming, in their ascent, a close network of anastomosing tubes, with exceedingly thin parietes ; this constitutes the rete testis. At the upper end of the mediastinum, the vessels of the rete testis terminate in from twelve to fifteen or twenty ducts, the vasa efferentia : they perforate the tunica albuginea, and carry the seminal fluid from the testis to the epididymis. Their course is at first straight; they then become enlarged, and exceedingly convoluted, and form a series of coni- cal masses, the co7d vasculosi, which, together, constitute the globus major of the epididymis. Each cone consists of a single convoluted duct, from six to eight inches in length, the diameter of which gradually decreases from the testis to the epididymis. Opposite the bases of the cones, the efferent vessels open at narrow intervals into a single duct, which constitutes, by its complex convolu- tions, the body and globus minor of the epididjj^mis. When the convolutions of this tube are unravelled, it measures upwards of twenty feet in length, and increases in breadth and thickness as it approaches the vas deferens. The con- volutions are held together by fine areolar tissue, and by bands of fibrous tissue. A long narrow tube, the vascuhim a/;ernMis of Haller, is occasionally found con- nected with the lower part of the canal of the epididymis, or with the commence-714 MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS. ment of the vas deferens. It extends up into the cord for about two or three inches, where it terminates by a blind extremity, which is occasionally bifurcated. Its length varies from an inch and a half to fourteen inches, and sometimes it be- comes dilated towards its extremity : more commonly, it retains the same diameter throughout. Its structure is similar to that of the vas deferens. Occasionally, it is found unconnected with the epididymis. The Vas Deferens, the excretory duct of the testis, is the continuation of the epididymis. Commencing at the lower pai-t of the globus minor, it ascends along the posterior and inner side of the testis and epididymis, and along the back part of the spermatic cord, through the spermatic canal to the intei'nal abdominal rino-. From the ring it descends into the pelvis, crossing the external iliac vessels, and curves round the outer side of the epigastric artery : at the side of the bladder, it arches backwards and downwards to its base, crossing outside the ol^literated hypogastric artery, and to the inner side of the ureter. At the base of the bladder, it lies between that viscus and the rectum, running along the inner . border of the vesicula seminalis. In this situation it becomes enlarged and sac- culated ; and, becoming narrowed, at the base of the prostate, unites with the duct of the vesicula seminalis to form the ejaculatory duct. The vas deferens presents a hard and cord-like sensation to the fingers ; it is about two feet in length, of cylin- drical form, and about a line and a quarter in diameter. Its walls are of extreme density and thickness, measuring one-third of a line ; and its canal is extremely small, measuring about half a line. In structure, the vas deferens consists of three coats : i. An external, or cellular coat; 2. A muscular coat, which is thick, dense, elastic, and consists of two longi- tudinal, and an intermediate circular layer of muscular fibres; 3. An internal, or mucous coat, which is pale, and arranged in longitudinal folds; its epithelial covering is of the columnar variety. Vesicula Seminales. The Semmal Vesicles are two lobulated membranous pouches, placed between the base of the bladder and the rectum, serving as reservoirs for the semen, and secreting some fluid to be added to that of the testicles. Each sac is somewhat pvramidalin form, the broad end being directed backwards, and the narrow end forward towards the prostate. They measure about two and a half inches m lenffth about five lines in breadth, and from two or three lines m thickness. Th^Y vary however, in size, not only in diflFerent individuals, but also m the same individual'on the two sides. Their upper surface is m contact with the base of the bladder, extending from near the termination of the ureters to the base of the Drostate gland Their under surface rests upon the rectum, fi-om which they ai-e separated by the recto-vesical fascia. Their posterior extremities diverge from each other Their anterior extremities are pointed, and converge towards the base of the prostate gland, where each joins with the corresponding vas deferens to form the eiaculatory duct. Along the inner margm of each vesicula runs the enlarged and convoluted vas deferens. The inner border of the vesiculae, and the corresponding vas deferens, form the lateral boundary of a triangular space, limited behTnd by the recto-vesical peritoneal fold; the portion of the bladder mcluded in this space rests on the rectum, and corresponds with thetrigonum vesicfe m its '''^^'structure. Each vesicula consists of a single tube, coiled upon itself, and giving off several irregular csEcal diverticula; the separate coils, as well as the diverticula, being connected together by fibrous tissue. When uncoiled, this tube is about the diameter of a qSill, and varies in length from four to six inches ; it terminates tosterrly in a culde-sac; its anterior extremity becomes constricted into a narrow straight duct, which joins on its inner side with the correspondmg vas one on each side^ are ^rmed by the junltnTthe duct of- the vesicula seminalis with the vas deferens. Each duct715 VESICUL.E SKMINALES. is about three-quarters of an inch in length ; it commences at the base of the prostate, and runs forwards and upwards in a canal in a s substance, and along the side of the utriculus, to terminate by a separate slit-hke orifice upon or withm the margins of the sinus pocularis. The ducts diminish m size, and converge towai'ds their termination. Structure. The vesicute seminales are composed of three coats: an external or fibro-cellular, derived from the recto-vesical fascia; a middle or fibroiis coai, which is firm, dense, fibrous in structure, somewhat elastic, and contains, according to B. H. Weber, muscular fibres ; and an irdernal or mucous coat, which is pale, ot a whitish-brown colour, and presents a delicate reticular structure, like that seen in the gall-bladder, but the meshes are finer. The epithelium is squamous, ihe coats of the ejaculatory ducts are extremely thin, the outer fibrous layer being almost entirely lost after their entrance into the prostate, a thin layer of muscular fibres and the mucous membrane forming the only constituents of the tubes. 391.—Base of the Bladder, ^ith the Vasa Deferentia and Vesiculfe Seminales. Jt^Jlt Ejaeula ta rtj duct Vessels and Nerves. The arteries supplying the vesiculse seminales are derived from the inferior vesical and middle htemorrhoidal. The veins and lymphatics accompany the arteries. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. The Semen is a thick, whitish fluid, having a peculiar odour. It consists of a fluid, the liquor seminis, and solid particles, the seminal granules, and spermatozoa. The liquor seminis is transparent, colourless, and of an albuminous compo- sition, containing particles of squamous and columnar epithelium, with oil- globules and granular matter floating in it, besides the above-mentioned solid elements. The seminal granules are round finely-granular corpuscles, measusing ^-f?,ytt^'^"^ of an inch in diameter. The spermatozoa, or spermatic filaments, are the essential agents in producing fecundation. They are minute elongated particles, consisting of a small flattened oval extremity or body, and a long slender caudal filament. A small circular spot is observed in the centre of the body, and at its point of connection with the tail there is frequently seen a projecting rim or collar. The movements of these bodies are remarkable, and consist of a lashing or undulatory motion of the tail.7i6 MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS. Descent ok the Testes. The testes, at an early period of fcetal life, are placed at the back part of the abdominal cavity, behind the peritoneum, in front, and a little below the kidneys. The anterior surface and sides are invested by pei'itoneum : the blood-vessels and efiTerent ducts are connected with their posterior surface; and attached to the lower end is a peculiar structure, the gubernaculum testis, which is said to assist in their descent. The Quberiiamlum Testis attains its full development between the fifth and sixth months; it is a conical-shaped cord, attached above to the lower end of the epididymis, and below to the bottom of the scrotum. It is placed behind the peritoneum, lying upon the fi-ont of the Psaos muscle, and completely filling the inguinal canal. It consists of a soft transparent areolar tissue within, which often appears partially hollow, surrounded by a layer of striped muscular fibres, the Cremaster, which ascends upon this body to be attached to the testis. According to Mr. Curling, the gubernaculum, as well as these muscular fibres, divides below into three processes : the external and broadest process is connected with Poupart's ligament in the inguinal canal; the middle process descends along the inguinal canal to the bottom of the scrotum, where it joins the dartos; the internal one is firmly attached to the os pubis and sheath of the Rectus muscle; some fibres, moreover, are reflected from the Internal oblique on to the front of the guberncaculum. Up to the fifth month, the testis is situated in the lumbar region, covered in front and at the sides by peritoneum, and supported in its position by a fold of that membrane, called the mesorchium ; between the fifth and sixth months the testis descends to the iliac fossa, the gubernaculum at the same time becoming shortened; during the seventh month, it enters the internal ab- dominal ring, a small pouch of peritoneum (processus vaginalis) preceding the testis in its course through the canal. By the end of the eighth month, the testis has descended into the scrotum, carrying down with it a lengtbened pouch of peri- toneum, which communicates by its upper extremity with the peritoneal cavity. Just before birth, the upper part of the pouch usually becomes closed, and this obliteration extends gradually downwards to within a short distance of the testis. The process of peritoneum surrounding the testis, which is now entirely cut ofi" from the general peritoneal cavity, constitutes the tunica vaginalis* Mr. Curling believes that the descent of the testis is effected by means of the muscular fibres of the gubernaculum ; those fibres which proceed from Poupart's ligament and the Obliquus internus are said to guide the organ into the inguinal canal; those attached to the pubis draw it below the external abdominal ring; and those attached to the bottom of the scrotum complete its descent. During the descent of the organ these muscular fibres become gradually everted, forming a muscular layer, which becomes placed external to the process of the peritoneum, surrounding the gland and spermatic cord, and constitutes the Cremaster. In the female, a small cord, corresponding to the gubernaculum in the male, descends to the inguinal region, and ultimately forms the round ligament of the utei-us. A pouch of peritoneum accompanies it along the inguinal canal, analogous to the processus vaginalis in the male ; it is called the canal nfNuch. * The obliteration of the process of peritoneum which accompanies the cord, and is hence called the fimicular process, is often incomplete. Ftu- an account of the various conditions produced fcy such incomplete obliteration (whicli are of great importance in the pathological anatomy of Inguinal Hernia), the student is referred to the' Essay on Hernia,' by Mr. Birkett, in ' A System of Surgery,' edited by T. Holmes, vol. iv.Female Organs of Generation rpHE external Organs of Generation in the female, are the mens Veneris, the JL labia majora and minora, the clitoris, the meatus urinarius, and the orifice of the vagina. The term ' vulva ' or ' pudendum,' as generally applied, includes all these parts. The mons Yeneris is the rounded eminence in front of the pubes, formed by a collection of fatty tissue beneath the integument. It surmounts the vulva, and is covered with hair at the time of puberty. The Uhia majora are two prominent longitudinal cutaneous folds, extending downwards from the mons Veneris to the anterior boundary of the perinajum, and enclosing an elliptical fissure, the common urino-sexual opening. Each labium m formed externally of integument, covered with hair ; internally, of mucous mem- brane, which IS continuous with the genito-urinary mucous tract; and between the two, ot a considerable quantity of areolar tissue, f-it, and a tissue resembling7i8 FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. the darfcos of the sci-otum, besides vesselB, nerves, and glands. The labia are thicker in front than behind, and joined together at each extremity, forming the anterior and posterior oomniissures. The interval left between the posterior com- missure and the margin of the anus is about an inch in length, and constitutes the perinteum. Just within the posterior comtnissure is a small transverse fold, the frcemthim pudendi or fourcliette, which is commonly ruptured in the first partu- rition, and the space between it and the commissui'e is called the fossa navicularie. • The labia are analogous to the scrotum in the male. The labia minora or nymphai are two small folds of mucous membrane, situated within the labia majora, extending from the clitoris obliquely downwards and . outwards for about an inch and a half on each side of the orifice of the vagina, on the sides of which they are lost. They are contimious externally with the labia majora, internally with the inner surface of the vagina. As they converge towards the clitoris in front, each labium divides into two folds, which surround the glans clitoridis, the superior folds uniting to form the pro3putium clitoridis, the inferior folds being attached to the glans, and forming the frasnum. The nymphas are composed of mucous membrane, covered by a thin epithelial layer. They contain a plexus of vessels in their interior, and are provided with numerous large mucous crypts which secrete abundance of sebaceous matter. The clitoris is an erectile structure, analogous to the corpora cavernosa of the penis. It is situated beneath the anterior commissure, partially hidden between the anterior extremities of the labia minora. It is an elongated organ, connected to the rami of the pubes and ischia on each side by two crura; the body is short, and concealed beneath the labia ; the free extremity, or glans clitoridis, is a small rounded tubercle, consisting of spongy erectile tissue, and highly sensitive. The clitoris consists of two corpora cavernosa, composed of erectile tissue enclosed in a dense layer of fibrous membrane, united together along their inner sui-faces by an incomplete fibrous pectiniform septum. It is provided, like the penis, vdth a suspensory ligament, and with two small muscles, the Erectores chtoridis, which are inserted into the crura of the corpora cavernosa. Between the clitoris, and the entrance of the vagina, is a triangular smooth surface, bounded on each side by the nymphae: this is the vestibule. The orifice of the urethra {meatus urinarius), is situated at the back part of the vestibule, about an inch below the clitoris, and near the margin of the vagina, surrounded by a prominent elevation of the mucous membrane. Below the meatus urinarius, is the orifice of the va,gina, an elliptical aperture, more or less closed in the virgin, by a membranous fold, the hymen. The lymen is a thin semilunar fold of mucous membrane, stretched across the lower part of the orifice of the vagina ; its concave margin being turned upwards towards the pubes. Sometimes this membrane forms a complete septum across the orifice of the vagina : a condition known as imperforate hymen. Occasionally, it forms a circular septum, perforated in the centre by a round opening • sometimes it is cribriform, or its free margin forms a membranous frino-e or it may be entirely absent. It may also persist after copulation. Tlic hym°en cannot, consequently, be considered as a test of virgimty. Its_ rupture, or the rudimentary condition of the membrane above referred to, gives rise to those small rounded elevations which surround the opening of the vagina, the carumida^ mvrtiformes. , ^ ,i Glands of Bartholine. On each side of the commencement of the vagina is a round or oblong body, of a reddish-yellow colour, and of the size of a horse- bean analogous to Cowper's gland in the male. It is Called the gland oj Bartholine. Each gland opens by means of a loijg single duct upon the inner 5de of the nymphs, external to the hymen. Extendmg from the clitoris, along e ther side of the vestibule, and lying a little behind the nymph^, are two argc oblong masses, about an inch in length, consisting of a plexus of veins enclosed r^l-^laver of fibrous membrane. These bodies are narrow m front, rounded lelo^ rndTre — with the crura of the clitoris and rami of the pubes;719 URETHRA. they are termed by Kobolt the hulbi vestlhuU; and he considers them analogous to tlie bulb of the corpus spongiosum in the male. Immediately m front of these bodies is a smaller venous plexus, continuous with the bulbi vestibuh bchmd and the glans clitoridis in front: it is called by Kobelt the pars intermedia, and is considered by him as analogous to that part of the body of the corpus spongiosum which immediately succeeds the bulb. ' 393._Section of Female Pelvis, showing position of Viscera. Bladder. The bladder is situated at the anterior part of the pelvis. It is in relation, in front, with the os pubis ; lehind, with the uterus, some convolutions of the small intestine being interposed; its base lies in contact with the neck of the uterus, and with the anterior wall of the vagina. The bladder is said to be larger in the female than in the male, and is very broad in its transverse diameter. Ueethra. . The urethra is a narrow membranous canal, about an inch and a half in length, extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It is placed beneath the symphysis pubis" imbedded in the anterior wall of the vagina; and its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards, its course being slightly curved, the concavity directed forwards and upwards. Its diameter, when un- dilated, about a quarter of an inch. The urethra perforates the triangular ligament, precisely as in the male, and is surrounded by the muscular fibres of the Compressor urethrna. Structure. The urethra consists of three coats : muscular, erectile, and mucous. The muscular coat is continuous with that of the bladder ; it extends the whole length of the tube, and consists of a thick stratum of circular fibres.720 FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. A fcliin layer of spongy, erectile tissue, intermixed with mucli elastic tissnn, lies immediately beneath the niucous coat. The vmcoios coat is palo, continuous, externally, with that of the vulva, and internally with that of the bladder. It is thrown into longitudinal folds, one of which, placed along the floor of the canal, resembles the verumontanum in the • male urethra. It is lined by laminated epithelium, which becomes spheroidal at the bladder. Its external orifice is surrounded by a few mucous follicles. The urethra, from not being surrounded by dense resisting structures, as in the male, admits of considerable dilatation, which enables the surgeon to remove; with considerable facility calculi, or other foreign bodies, from the cavity of the bladder. Rectum, The rectum is more capacious, and less curved in the female, than in the male. The first portion extends from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the middle of the sacrum. Its connections are similar to those in the male. The second ijortion extends to the tip of the coccyx. It is covered in front by the peritoneum, but only for a short distance, at its upper part: it is in relation with the posterior wall of the vagina. The tliird portion curves backwards, from the vagina to the anus, leaving a space which corresponds on the surface of the body to the perinaeum. Its ex- tremity is surrounded by the Sphincter muscles, and its sides are supported by the Levatores ani. The Yagina. The vagina is a membranous canal, extending from the vulva to the uterus. It is situated in the cavity of the pelvis, behind the bladder, and in front of the rectum. Its direction is curved forwards and downwards, following at first the line of the axis of the cavity of the pelvis, and afterwards that of the outlet. It is cylindrical in shape, flattened from before backwards, and its walls ai-e ordinarily in contact with each other. Its length is about four inches along its anterior wall, and between five and six inches along its posterior wall. It is con- stricted at its commencement, and becomes dilated near its uterine extremity; it surrounds the vaginal portion of the cervix uteri, a short distance from the os, and its attachment extends higher up on the posterior than on the anterior wall of the uterus. Relations. Its anterior swrface is concave, and in relation with the base of the bladder, and with the urethra. Its posterior surface is convex, and connected to the anterior waU of the rectum, for the lower three-fourths of its extent, the upper fourth being separated from that tube by the recto-uterine fold ^ of peri- toneum which forms a cul-de-sac between the vagina and rectum. Its sides give attachment superiorly to the broad ligaments, and inferiorly to the Levatores am muscles and recto-vesical fascia. Structure. The vagina consists of an external, or muscular coat, a layer ot erectile tissue, and an internal mucous lining. The muscular coat consists of longitudinal fibres which surround the vagina, and are continuous with the superficial muscular fibres of the uterus. The strongest fasciculi are those attached to the recto-vesical fascia on each side. The erectile tissue is enclosed between two layers of fibrous membrane: it is more abundant at the lower than at the upper part of the vagina. The mucous membrane is continuous, above, with that lining the uterus, and below with the integument covering the labia majora. Its inner surface presents, aloncr'the anterior and posterior walls, a longitudinal ridge, or raphe, called the columns of the vagina, ^nd numerous transverse ridges, or rugte, extending out- wards from the raphe on each side. These rugn3 are most distinct near the orifice of the vagina, especially in females before parturition. They indicate its adaptationTHE UTERUS. 721 for dilatation, and are calculated to facilitate its enlargement during parturition, The mucous membi-ane is covered with conical and filiform papillas, and provided with mucous glands and folHcles, which are especially numerous m its upper part, and around the cervix uteri. The epitheUum is of the squamous variety. The Uterus. The uterus is the organ of gestation, receiving the fecundated ovum in its cavity, retaining and supporting it during the development of the foetus, and becoming the principal agent in its expulsion at the time of parturition. In the virgin state it is pear-shaped, flattened from before backwards, and situated in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum; it is re- tained in its position by the round and broad ligaments on each side, and projects into the upper end of the vagina below. Its upper end, or base, is directed up- wards and forwards ; its lower end, or apex, downwards and backwards, in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pelvis. It therefore forms an angle with the vagina, since the direction of the vagina corresponds to the axis of the cavity and outlet of the pelvis. The uterus nieasui-es about three inches in length, two in breadth at its upper part, and an inch in thickness, and it weighs from an ounce to an ounce and a half. The ftmdus is the upper broad extremity of the organ: it is convex, covered by peritoneum, and placed on a line below the level of the brim of the pelvis. The body gradually narrows from the fundus to the neck. Its anterior surface is flattened, covered by peritoneum in the upper three-fourths of its extent, and separated from the bladder by some convolutions of the small intestine : the lower fourth is connected with the bladder. Its posterior surface is convex, covered by peritoneum throughout, and separated from the rectum by some convolutions of the intestine. Its lateral margins are concave, and give attachment to the Fallopian tube above, the round ligament below and in front of this, and the ligament of the ovary behind and below both of these structures. The cervix is the lower rounded and constricted portion of the uterus; around its circumference is attached the upper end of the vagina, which extends upwards a greater distance behind than in front. At the vaginal extremity of the uterus is a transverse aperture, the os uteri, bounded by two lips, the anterior of which is thick, the posterior narrow, and long. Ligaments. The ligaments of the uterus are six in number: two anterior, two posterior, and two lateral. They are formed of peritoneum. The tioo anterior ligaments (^vesico-uterine), are two semilunar folds, which pass between the neck of the uterus and the posterior surface of the bladder. The two posterior ligaments (recto-uterine), pass between the sides of the uterus and rectum. The tioo lateral or hroad ligaments pass from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis, forming a septum across the pelvis, which divides that cavity into two portions. In the anterior part are contained the bladder, urethra and vagina; in the posterior part, the rectum. The cavity of the uterus is small in comparison with the size of the organ; that portion of the cavity which corresponds to the body is triangular, flattened from before backwards, so that its walls are closely approximated, and havino- its base directed upwards towards the fundus. At each superior angle is a funnel- shaped^ cavity, which constitutes the remains of the division of the body of the ■uterus into two comua; and at the bottom of each cavity is the minute orifice of the FaUopian tube. At the inferior angle of the uterine cavity is a small con. Btricted opening, the internal orifice {ostium internum), which leads into the cavity of the cervix. The cavity of the cervix is somewhat cylindrical, flattened from before backwards, broader at the middle than at either extremity, and com- municates, below, with the vagina. Each wall of the canal presents a longitudinal column, from which proceed a number of small oblique columns, giving the ap.722 FEMA.LE OitGANS OF GENERATION. pearanco of bi-anclies from the stem of a tree, and hence the name arbor vUcb uterinus applied it. These folds usually become very indistincb after the first labour. Structure. The uterus is composed of three coats: an external serous coat, a middle or muscular layer, and an internal mucous coat. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum ; it invests the fundus and the ■whole of the posterior surface of the body of the uterus ; but only the upper three- fourths of its anterior surface. The muscular coat forms the chief bulk of the substance of the uterus. In the unimprognated state, it is dense, firm, of a greyish colour, and cuts almost like cartilage. It is thick opposite the middle of the body and fundus, and thin at the orifices of the Fallopian tubes. It consists of bundles of unstriped muscular fibres, disposed in layers, intermixed with areolar tissue, blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves. In the impregnated state, the muscular tissue becomes more prominently developed, and is disposed in three layei'S: external, middle, and internal. The external layer is placed beneath the peritoneum, disposed as a thin plane on the anterior and posterior surfaces. It consists of fibres, which pass transversely across the fundus, and, converging at each superior angle of the uterus, are con- tinued on the Fallopian tubes, the round ligament, and ligament of the ovary ; some passing at each side into the broad ligament, and others running backwards from the cervix into the recto-uterine ligaments. The middle layer of fibres presents no regularity in its arrangement, being dis- posed longitudinally, obliquely, and transversely. The internal, or deep layer, consists of circular fibres arranged in the form of two hollow cones, the apices of which surround the orifices of the Fallopian tubes, their bases intermingling with one another on the middle of the body of the uterus. At the cervix these fibres are disposed transversely. The mucous memiirane is thin, smooth, and closely adherent to the subjacent tissue. It is continuous, through the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes, with the peritoneum; and, through the os uteri, with the mucous membrane lining the vagina. In the body of the uterus, it is smooth, soft, of a reddish colour, lined by columnar-ciliated epithelium, and presents, when viewed with a lens, the orifices of numerous tubular follicles arranged perpendicularly to the surface. They are of small size in the unimpregnated uterus, but shortly after impregnation they are enlarged, elongated, presenting a contorted or waved appearance towards their closed extremities, which occasionally dilate into two or three sacculated extremities. The circular orifices of these glands may be seen on the ioner surface of the mucous membrane, many of which during the early period of pregnancy are sur- rounded by a whitish ring formed of epithelium which lines the follicles. In the impregnated uterus, the epithelium loses its ciliated character. In the cervix, the mucous membrane between the rug® and around the os uten is provided with numerous mucous follicles, and glands. The small, transparent, vesicular elevations, so often found within the os and cervix uteri, are due to closure of the mouths of these folhcles, and their distension with their proper secretion. They were called the ovula of Naboth. The mucous membrane covering the lower half of the cervix presents numerous papilte. Vessds and Nerves, The arteries of the uterus ai-e the uterine, from the internal iliac ; and the ovarian, from the aorta. They are remarkable for their tortuous course in the substance of the organ, and for their frequent anastomoses. The veins are of large size, and correspond with the arteries. In the impregnated uterus these vessels are termed the utemie sinuses, consisting of the lining mem- brane of the veins adhering to the walls of canals channelled through the substance of the uterus. They terminate in the uterine plexuses. The lymphatics are of large size in the impregnated uterus, and terminate in the pelvic and lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the inferior hypogastric and spermatic plexuses, and from the third and fourth sacral nerves.appHndages of the uterus. 723 The form, size, and situation of the uterus vary at diderent periods of Ufe and under different circumstances. , , • ,• v j i • In thefatus, the uterus is contained in the abdommal cavity, projecting beyond the hrim of the pelvis. The cervix is considerably larger than the body. . , ^ ^ . , , At pubertiLtYie uterus is pyriform in shape, aud weighs from eight to ten drachms. It has descended into the pelvis, the fundus being just below the level of the brim of this cavity. The arbor vitro is distinct, and extends to the upper part ot the cavity ot the ° ^^Buring and after menstruation, the organ is enlarged, and more vascular, its surfaces rounder; the os externum is rounded, its labia swollen, and the lining membrane of the body thickened, softer, and of a darker colour. During Pi-egnancy, the uterus increases so as to weigh from one pound and a half to three pounds. It becomes enormously enlarged, and projocts into the hypogastric and lower part of the umbilical regions. This enlargement, which continues up to the sixth month of gestation, is partially due to increased development of pre-existing and new-formed muscular tissue. The round ligaments are enlarged, and the broad ligaments become encroached upon bv the uterus making its way between their laminae. The mucous membrane becomes more '^-ascular, its mucous follicles and glands enlarged; the rugae and folds in the canal of the cervix become obliterated ; the blood and lymphatic vessels as well as the nerves, according to the researches of Dr. Lee, greatly enlarged. After Parturition, the uterus nearly regains its usual size, weighing from two to three ounces; but its cavity is larger than in the virgin state ; the external orifice is more marked, and assumes a transverse direction; its edges present a fissured surface; its vessels are tortuous; and its muscular layers are more defined. In old age, the uterus becomes atrophied, and paler and denser in texture; a more distinct constriction separates the body and cervix. The ostium internum, and, occasionally, the vaginal orifice, often become obliterated, and its labia almost entirely disappear. Appendages of the Uteeus. The appendages of the uterus are, the Eallopian tubes, tlie ovaries and tHeir ligaments, and the round ligaments. These structures, together with their nutrient vessels and nerves, and some scattered muscular fibres, are enclosed between the two folds of peritoneum, which constitute the broad ligaments ; they are placed in the following order: in front is the round ligament; the Eallopian tube occupies the free margin of the broad ligament: the ovary and its ligament are behind and below the latter. The Fallopian Tithes, or oviducts, convey the ova from the ovaries to the cavity of the uterus. They are two in number, one on each side, situated in the free margin of the broad ligament, extending from each superior angle of the uterus to the sides of the pelvis. Each tube is about four inches in length ; its canal is exceedingly minute, and commences at the superior angle of the uterus by a minute orifice, the ostium internum, which will hardly admit a fine bristle; it continues narrow along the inner half of the tube, and then gradually widens into a trumpet-shaped extremity, which becomes contracted at its termination. This orifice is called the ostium abdominale, and communicates with the peritoneal cavity. Its margins are surrounded by a series of fringe-like processes, termed fimhnce, and one of these processes is connected with the outer end of the ovary. To this part of the tube the n».mefimbriated extremity is applied; it is also called morsus diaboli, from the peculiar manner in which it embraces the surface of the ovary during sexual excitement. Structure. The Fallopian tube consists of three coats : serous, muscular, and mucous. The external or serous coat is derived from the peritoneum. The middle or muscular coat consists of an external longitudinal and an internal or circular layer of muscular fibres continuous with those of the uterus. The internal or mucous coat is continuous with the mucous lining of the uteras, and at the free extremity of the tube with the peritoneum. It is thrown into longitudinal folds in the outer part of the tube, which indicate its adaptation for di atation, and is covered by columnar ciliated epithehum. This form of epithelium is also found on the inner and outer surfaces of the fimbriro. The Ovaries (testes muliebres, Galen) are analogous to the testes in the male 3 A 2FEMALE ORGANS OF GENEJ^-ATION. They are oval-shapod bodies, of an elougatod form, flattened from above down- wards, situated one on each side of the uterus, in the posterior part of the broad hgament behind and below the Fallopian tubes. Each ovary is connected, by its anterior margin, to the broad ligaments ; by its inner extremity to the uterus by a proper ligament, the ligament of the ovary ; and by its outer end to the fimbriated 394—The Uterus and its Appendages, Anterior View. 395.—Section of the Ovary of a Virgin, Showing the Stroma and Graafian Vesicles. extremity of the Fallopian tube by a short ligamentous cord. The ovaries are of a whitish colour, and present either a smooth or puckered uneven surface. They are each about an inch and a half in length, three-quarters of an inch in width, and about a third of an inch thick ; and weigh from one to two drachms. The surfaces and posterior convex border are free, the anterior straight border being attached to the broad ligament. Structure. The ovary is invested by peritoneum,- excepting along its anterior attached margin ; beneath this, is the proper fibrous covering of the organ, the tunica albuginea, which is extremely dense and firm in sti'ucture, and encloses a pecular soft fibrous tissue, or stroma, abundantly supplied with blood-vessels (Sg- 39S)- Imbedded in the meshes of this tissue are numerous small, round, transparent vesicles, in various stages of development; they are the Graafian vesicles, the ovisacs containing the ova. In women who have not borne children, they vary in number from ten to fifteen or twenty; and in size from a pin's head to a pea; but Dr. Martin Barry has shown, that a large number of micro- scopic ovisacs exist in the parenchyma of the organ, few of which produce ova. These vesicles have thin, transparent walls, and are filled with a clear colour- less, albuminous fluid. The Graafian vesicles are, during their early development, small, and deeply seated in the substance of the ovary ; as they enlarge, they approach the surface; and, when mature, form small projections on the exterior of the ovaiy beneath the peritoneum. Each vesicle consists of an 396.—Section of the Graafiau Vesicle. After Von Baer,APPENDAGES OF THE UTERUS. 725 external fibro-vascnlar coat, connected with the surrounding stroma of the ovary by a network of blood-vessels ; and an internal coat, named ovi-capside, which is lined by a layer of nucleated cells, called the membmna granulosa. The fluid contained in the interior of the vesicles is transparent and albuminous, and in it is suspended the ovum. ^ n • ^ j The formation, development, and maturation of the Graafian vesicles and ova continue uninterruptedly from infancy to the end of the fruitful period of woman s life. Before puberty, the ovaries are small, the Graafian vesicles contained m them minute, and few in number ; and few, probably, ever attain full development, but shrink and disappear, their ova being incapable of impregnation. At puberty the ovaries enlarge, are more vascular, the Graafian vesicles are developed in greater abundance, and their ova capable of fecundation. Discharge of the Ovum. The Graafian vesicles, after gradually approaching the surface of the ovary, burst; the ovum and fluid contents of the vesicles are liberated, and escape on the exterior of the ovary, passing from thence into the Eallopian tube, the fimbriated processes of which are supposed to grasp the ovary, the aperture of the tube being applied to the part corresponding to the matured and bursting vesicle. In the human subject and most mamnialia, the maturation and discharge of the ova occur at regular periods only, and are indicated, in the mammalia, by the phenomena of heat or rut; and in the human female, by men- struation. Sexual desire is mote intense in females at this period; and if the ■union of the sexes takes place, the ovum may be fecundated. Corpus Luteum. Immediately after the rupture of a Graafian vesicle, and the escape of its ovum, the vesicle is filled with blood-tinged fluid; and in a short time the circumference of the vesicle is occupied by a firm, yellow substance, which is probably formed from plasma exuded from its walls. Dr. Lee believes that this yellow matter is deposited outside both the membranes of the follicle ; Montgomery regards it as placed between the layers ; while Kolliker considers it ..as a thickening of the inner layer of the outer coat of the follicle. The exudation is at first of a dark brown or brownish-red colour, but it soon becomes paler, and its consistence more dense. For every follicle in the ovary from which an ovum is discharged, a corpus luteum will be found. But the characters it exhibits, and the changes produced in it, will be determined by the circumstance of the ovum being impregnated or not. Although there is little doubt that corpora lutea exist in the ovaries after the escape of ova, independent of coitus or inapregnation, it appears that the corpus luteum of pregnancy (true corpus luteum) possesses characters by which it may be distinguished from one formed in a follicle, from which an ovum has been dis- charged without subsequent impregnation (false corpus luteum.) The true corpora lutea are of large size, often as large as a mulberry; of a rounded form, and project from the surface of the ovary, the summit of the pro- jection presenting a triangular depression or cicatrix, where the peritoneum appears to have been torn. They contain a small cavity in their centre during the early period of their formation, which becomes contracted, and exhibits a stellate cicatrix during the latter stages of pregnancy. Their vascularity, lobulated or puckered appearance, firm consistence, and yellow colour, are also characteristic marks of true corpora lutea. False corpora lutea are of small size, do not project from the surface of the ovary, are angular in form, seldom present any cicatrix, contain no cavity in their centre; the material composing them is not lobulated, its consistence is usually soft, often resembling coagulated blood ; the yellow matter exists in the form of a very thin layer, or more commonly is entirely wanting. False corpora lutea most frequently result from the efi"usion into the cavities of the Graafian vesicles of serum or blood, which subsequently undergoes various changes, and is ultimately removed. Dr. Lee states, that in the false corpora lutea the yellow substance ia contained within, or attached to, the inner surface of the Graafian vesicle, and does not surround it, as ia the case in the true corpora lutea.726 FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. In the fcBtus, tlie ovaries aro situated, like the testes, in the lumbar region, near the kidneys. They may be distinguished from those bodies at an early period by their elongated and flattened form, and by their position, which is at first oblique and then nearly ti'ansverse. Thoy gradually descend into the pelvis. The Licjamenf, of the ovary is a rounded cord, which extends from each superior angle of the uterus to the inner exti-emity of the ovary ; it consists of fibrous tissue, and a few muscular fibres derived from the uterus. The Bound LigamPMts are two rounded cords, between four and five inches in length, situated between the layers of the broad ligament in front of and below the Fallopian tube. Commencing on each side at the superior angle of the uterus, this ligament passes forwards and outwards through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal to the labia majora, in which it becomes lost. The round . ligament consists of areolar tissue, vessels, and nerves, besides a dense bundle of I fibrous tissue, and muscular fibres prolonged from the uterus, enclosed in a dupli- ■ cature of peritoneum, which, in the foetus, is prolonged in the form of a tubular , process for a short distance into the inguinal canal. This process is called the camZ I of NucJc. It is generally obliterated in the adult, but sometimes remains pervious I even in advanced Ufe. It is analogous to the peritoneal pouch which accompanies the descent of the testis. Vessels and Nerves, The arteries of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes are the ovarian from the aorta. They anastomose with the termination of the uterine arteries, and enter the attached border of the ovary. The veins foUow the course of the arteries; they form a plexus near tbe ovary, the pampiniform plexus. The nerves. are derived from the inferior hypogastric, or pelvic, plexus and from the ovarian plexus, the Fallopian tube receiving a brancb from one of the uterine nerves. Mammaet Glands. The mammae, or breasts, are accessary glands of the generative system, which secrete the milk. They exist in the male as well as in the female; but in the former only in a rudimentary state, unless their growth is excited by peculiar circumstances. In the female, they are two large hemispherical eminences situated towards the lateral aspect of the pectoral region, corresponding to the interval between the third and sixth or seventh ribs, and extending from the side of the sternum to the axilla. Their weight and dimensions differ at different periods of Hfe, and in different individuals. Before puberty they are of small size, but enlarge as the generative organs become more completely developed. They increase durmg pregnancy, and especially after delivery, and become atrophied in old age. The left mamma is generally a little larger than the right. Their base is nearly cii-cular, flattened or shghtly concave, and has its long diameter directed up- wards and outwards towards the axilla; they are separated from the Pectoral muscles by a tHn layer of superficial fascia. The outer surface of the mamma is convex, and presents, just below the centre, a smaU conical prominence, the nipple {mammilla). The surface of the nipple is dark-coloured, and surrounded by an areola having a coloured tint. In the virgin, the areola is of a deUcate rosy hue ; about the second month of impregnation, it enlarges, and acquires a darker tinge, which increases as pregnancy advances, becoming, in some cases, of a dark brown, or even black colour. This colour diminishes as soon as lactation is over, but is never entirely lost through life. These changes in the colour of the areola are of extreme importance in forming a conclusion in a case of suspected pregnancy. . - The nipple is a cyHndrical or conical eminence, capable of undergomg a sort ot erection from mechanical excitea.ent. It is of a pink or brownish hue, its sur- face wrinkled and p.ovidcd with papillce, and it as perforated by numerous orifices, the apertures of the lactiferous ducts. Near'the base of the nipple, and upon the surface of the areola, are numerous sebaceous glands, which become mucli enlarged during lactation, and present the appearance of small tubercles beneathMAMMARY GLAND. 727 tte skin.

It consists of numerous lobes, and these are composed ot lobules, connected together by areolar tissue, blood-vessels and ducts. The smallest lobules consist of a cluster of rounded vesicles, which open into the smallest branches ot the lactiferous ducts; these ducts uniting, form larger ducts, which terminate in a single canal, corresponding with one of the chief subdivisions of the gland. The number of excretory ducts varies from fifteen to twenty: they are termed the tuiuU lactiferi, galaetopliori. They converge towards the at-eola, beneath which they form dilatations, or ampulla), which serve as reservoirs for the milk, and, at the base of the nipple, become contracted, and pursue a straight course to its summit, perforating it by separate orifices considerably narrower than the ducts themselves. The ducts are composed of areolar tissue, with longitudinal and transverse elastic fibres, and longitudinal muscular fibres : their mucous_ lining is continuous, at the point of the nipple, with the integument: the epithelium is of the tesselated or scaly variety. The filrms tissue invests the entire surface of the breast, and sends down septa between its lobes, connecting them together. The fatty tissv,e surrounds the surface of the gland, and occupies the intervals between its lobes and lobules. It usually exists in considerable abundance, and determines the form and size of the gland. There is no fat immediately beneath the areola and nipple. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries supplying the mammee are derived from the thoracic branches of the axillary, the intercostals, and internal mammary. The veins describe an anastomotic circle round the base of the nipple, called by Haller the circulus venosus. From this, large branches transmit the blood to the cir- cumference of the gland, and end in the axillary and internal mammary veins. The hjmphatics run along the lower border of the Pectoralis major to the axillary glands. The nerves are derived from the anterior and lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax.The Surgical Anatomy of Inguinal Hernia. Dissection (fig. 397). For dissection of the parts concerned in inguinal hernia, a male J3ubiect, free from fat, should always be selected. The body should be placed in the supine {)osition, the abdomen and pelvis raised by means of blocks placed benealh them, and the ower extremities rotated outwards, so as to make the parts as tense as possible. If the abdominal walls are flaccid, the cavity of the abdomen should be inflated by an aperture through the umbilicus. An incision should be made along the middle line, from the um- bilicus to the pubes, and continued along the front of the scrotum ; and a second incision, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to just below the umbilicus. These incisions should divide the integument; and the triangular-shaped flap included between them should be reflected downwards and outwards, when the supei^cial fascia will be exposed. Tlie superficial fascia in this region consists of two layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves, and the inguinal lymphatic glands. The superficial layer is thick, areolar in texture, containing adipose tissue in its meshes, the quantity of which varies in difi'erent subjects. Below, it passes over Poupart's ligament, and is continuous with the outer layer of the superficial fascia of the thigh. This fascia is continued as a tubular prolongation around the outer surface of the cord and testis. In this situation, it changes its charac- ter ; it becomes thin, destitute of adipose tissue, and of a pale reddish colour, and assists in forming the dartos. From the scrotum, it may be traced backwards to be continuous with the superficial fascia of the perinaeum. This layer should be removed, by dividing it across in the same direction as the external incisions, and reflecting it downwards and outwards, when the following vessels and nerves will be exposed:— The superficial epigastric, supei-ficial circumflex iliac, and superficial external pudic vessels; the terminal filaments of the iho-hypogastiic and iUo-iuguinal nerves ; and the upper chain of inguinal lymphatic glands. The superficial epigastric artery crosses Poupart's ligament, and ascends ob- liquely towards the umbilicus, lying midway between the spine of the iUum and the pubes. It supplies the integument, and anastomoses with the deep epigastric. This vessel is a branch of the -common femoral artery, and pierces the fascia lata, below Poupart's ligament. Its accompanying vein empties itself into the internal saphenous, after having pierced the cribriform fascia. The superficial circumftex iliac artery passes outwards towards the crest of the ilium. The superficial external pudic artery passes transversely inwards across the spermatic cord, and supplies the integument of the hypogastric region, and of the penis and scrotum. This vessel is usually divided in the first incision made in the operation for inguinal hernia, and occasionally requires the application of a ligature. The veins accompanying these superficial vessels are usually much larger than the ao-teries : they terminate in the internal saphenous vein. Lymphatic vessels are found, taking the same course as the blood-vessels: they return the lymph from the superficial structures in the lower part of the abdomen, the scrotum, penis, and external surface of the buttock, and termduate in a small chain of lymphatic glands, three or four in number, which lie on a level with Poupart's ligament. Nerves. The terminal branch of the ilio-inguiaaal nerve emerges at the external abdominal ring: and the hypogastric branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve perfo- rates the aponeurosis of the external oblique, above and to the outer sid« -of the external ring. The deep layer of superficial fascia should be divided across in the sameEXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE. 729 aii-ection a3 the external incisions, separated from tlie aponeurosis of the External oblique, to which it is connected by delicate areolar tissue, and reflected down- wards and outwards. It is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength. It is intimately adherent, in the middle line, to the Imea alba and below" to the whole length of Poupart's ligament and the upper part of the fascia lata. It forms a thin tubular prolongation round the outer surtace ot tlie cord, which blends with the superficial layer, and is continuous with the dartos ot the scrotum. From the back of the scrotum, the conjoined layers may be traced into the perineum, where they are continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia in that region, which is attached, behiud, to the triangular ligament, and on each side, to the ramus of the pubes and ischium. The connections of this fascia serve to explain the course taken by the urine in extravasation of that fluid from rupture of the urethra: passing forwards from the periuEeum into the scrotum, it ascends on to the abdomen, but is prevented extending into the thighs by the attachment of the fascia to the ramus of the pubes and ischium, on each side, and to Poupart's ligament in front, and is prevented from passing on to the buttock by the posterior connections of the perineal fascia. 397.—Inguinal Hernia. Superficial Dissection, The aponeurosis of the External oUiqite muscle is exposed on the removal of this fascia. It is a thin, strong, membranous aponeurosis, the fibres of which are directed obliquely downwards and inwards. It is attached to the anterior superior Spinous process of the ilium, the spine of the pubes, the liuca ilio-pectinea, front of the pubes and linea alba. That portion of the aponeurosis which extends from the730 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. anterior superior spine of the ilium, to the spine of the pnbes, is termed Poupart's Ligament, or the crural arch ; and that portion which is inserted into the pectineal line, is termed Gimbornat's Ligament. Just above and to the outer side of the crest of the pubes, an interval is seen in the aponeurosis of the External oblique, called the external abdominal ring, which transmits the speimiatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. This aperture is oblique in direction, somewhat triangular in form, and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It usually measures from base to apex about an inch, and transvei*sely about half an inch. It is bounded below by the crest of the os pubis ; above, by a series of curved fibres, the inter columnar, which pass across the upper angle of the ring so as to increase its strength ; and on either side, by the free borders of the aponeurosis, which are called the cohomns or pilla/rs of the rviig. The external pill-ar, which, at the same time, is inferior from the obliquity of its direction, is the stronger; it is formed by that portion of Poupart's ligament which is inserted into the spine of the pubes ; it is curved round the spermatic cord, so as to form a kind of groove, upon which the cord rests. The internal or mperior pillar is a broad, thin, flat band, which interlaces with its fellow on the opposite side, in front of the symphysis pubis, that of the right side being superficial. The external abdominal ring gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female ; it is mucb larger in men than in women, on account of the large size of the spermatid; cord, and henCe the greater frequency of inguinal bemia in men. The mt&rcolumnar fibres are a series of curved tendinous fibres, which arch across the lower part of the aponeurosis of the External obhque. They have received their name from stretching across between the tvvo pillars of the external ring; they increase the strength of the membrane which bounds the upper part of this aperture, and prevent the divergence of the pillars from one another. They are thickest below, where they are connected to the outer third of Poupart's ligament, and are inserted into the linea alba; describing a curve, with the con- vexity downwards. They are much thicker and stronger at the outer angle of the external ring than internally, and are more sti-ongly developed in the male than in the female. These fibres are continuous with a thin fascia, which is closely con- nected to the margins of the external ring, and has received the name of the inter- columnar or external spermatic fascia; it forms a tubular prolongation around the outer surface of the cord and testis, and encloses them in a distinct sheath. The sac of an inguinal hernia, in passing through the external abdominal ring, receives an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. The finger should be introduced a short distance into the external ring, and then, if the limb is extended and rotated outwards, the aponeurosis of the External obhque, together with the iliac portion of the fascia lata, will be felt to become tense, and the external ring much contracted; if the limb is, on the contrary, flexed upon the pelvis and rotated inwards, this aponeurosis wiU become lax, and the external ring sufficiently enlarged to admit the finger with comparative ease : hence the patient should always be put in the latter position when the taxis is appHed for the reduction of an inguinal hernia, in order that the abdominal walls may be as much relaxed as possible. The aponeurosis of the External ohfique should he rftmoved by dividing it across in the same direction as the external incisions, and reflecting it outwards; great care is requisite inenarating it from the aponeurosis of the muscle beneath. The lower nart of the lnternal obliq ue and the Cremaster are then exposed, together with the inguinal canal, which con- Sns the spermatic cord (fig. 398). The mode of insertion of Poupart's and Gmibernats ligaments into the pubes should also be examined. FouparVs ligament, or the crural arch, extends from the anterior superior SDine of the ilium to the spine of the pubes. It is also attached to the pectinea line to the extent of about an inch, forming Gimbemat'a ligament. Its generalGIMBERNAT'S LIGAMENT. 731 direction is curved towards the tliigh, where it is continuous with the fascia lata. ■ Its outer half is rounded, oblique in its direction, and continuous with the iliac fascia. Its inner half gradually widens at its attachment to the pubes, is more horizontal in direction, and lies beneath the spermatic cord. aivibernat's ligament is that portion of the aponeurosis of the External oblique which is inserted into the pectineal line; it is thin, membranous m structure, triangular in shape, the base directed outwards, and passes upwards and backwards beneath the spermatic cord, from the spine of the os pubis to the pectineal Ime, to the extent of about half an inch. The triangular ligament is a band of tendinous fibres, of a triangular shape, which is continued from Poupart's ligament at its attachment to the pectineal line upwards and inwards, behind the inner pillar of the external ring to the Imea alba. The Internal oblique Muscle has been described (p. 250). The part which is now exposed is partly muscular and partly tendinous in structure. Those fibres .which arise from the outer part of Poupart's Kgament are thin, pale in colour, curve downwards, and terminate in an aponeurosis, which passes in front of the Rectus and Pyramidalis muscles, to be inserted into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, to the extent of half an inch, in comnaon with that of the Trans- versalis muscle, forming by their junction the conjoined tendon. This tendon is placed immediately behind Gimbernat's ligament and the external abdominal ring and serves to strengthen what would otherwise be a very weak point in the abdominal wall. When a direct inguinal hernia passes through the external rmg, the conjoined tendon usually forms one of its coverings. The Cremaster is a slender muscular fasciculus, which arises from the middle ofSURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HEENIA. 732 Poupart's ligament at the inner side of the Internal oblique, being connected with that muscle, and also occasionally with the Transversalis. It passes along the outer side of the spermatic cord, descends with it through the external ring upon the front and sides of the cord, and forms a series of loops, which differ in thick- ness and length in different subjects. Those at the upper part of the cord are exceedingly short, but they become in succession longer and longer, the longest reaching down as low as the testicle, whei'o a few are inserted into the tunica vaginalis. Theso loops are united together by areolar tissue, and form a thin covering over the cord, the fascia cremastertca. The fibres ascend along the inner side of the cord, and are inserted by a small pointed tendon, into the crest of the OS pubis and front of the sheath of the Rectus muscle. It will be observed, that the origin and insertion of the Gremaster is precisely similar to that of the lower fi.bre8 of the Internal oblique. This fact affords an easy explanation of the manner in which the testicle and cord are invested by this muscle. At an early period of foetal life, the testis is placed at the lower and back part of the abdominal cavity, but, during its descent towards the scrotum which takes place before birth, in passes beneath the arched border of the Internal oblique. In its passage beneath this muscle some fibres are derived from its lower part, which accompany the testicle and cord into the scrotum. It occasionally happens that the loops of the Gremaster surround the cord, some lying behind as well as in front. It is probable that, under these circum- stances, the testis, in its descent, passed through instead of beneath the fibres of the Internal oblique. In the descent of an oblique inguinal hernia, which takes the same course as the spermatic cord, the Gremaster muscle forms one of its coverings. This muscle becomes largely developed in cases of hydrocele and large old scrotal hernias. No such muscle exists in the female, but an analogous structure is developed m those cases where an oblique inguinal hernia descends beneath the margm of the Internal oblique. The Internal Oblique should be detached from Poupart's ligament, separated from the Transversalis to the same extent as in the previous incisions, and reflected inwards on to the sheath of the Rectus (fig. 39^). The circumflex iliac vessels, which lie between these two muscles, form a valuable guide to their separation. The TransveraUs muscle has been previously described (p. 253). Its lower part is partly fleshy and partly tendinous in structure; this portion arises from the outer third of Poupart's ligament, and, arching downwards and inwards over the cord, terminates in an aponeurosis, which is inserted into the linea alba, the crest of the pubes, and the pectineal liiie to the extent of an inch, formmg, together with the Internal obhque, the conjoined tendon. Between the lower border of this muscle and Poupart's ligament, a space is left m which is seen the fascia transveralis. _ j • xi i q The inguinal, or spermatic canal, contains the spermatic cord in the male, ana the round ligament iii the female. It is an oblique canal, about an inch and a half in length, directed downwards and inwards, and placed paraHel with and a little above, Poupart's ligament. It communicates, above, with the cavity ot the abdomen, by means of the internal abdominal ring, which is the point wlierc the cord enters the spermatic canal; and terminates, below, at the external ring. It is bounded, in front, by the integument and superficial fascia, by the apo- neurosis of the External oblique throughout its whole length, and by the interna oblique for its outer third; behind, by the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and Transversalis, the triangular ligament, transvex-salis fascia, and tlio subperitoneal fat and peritoneum; above, by the arched fibres of tlie interna obHaue and Transversalis; below, by the union of the fascia transversahs with Poupa t's ligament. That form of protrusion in which the intestine follows the ToTrse of tl'e spermatic cord along the spermatic canal, is called oU,,^.^ngun^al henda.FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. 733 " The fascia transversalis is a thin aponeurotic membrano, which lies between the inner surface of the Transversalia muscle and the fy|to"f^^™- . I forms part of the general layer of fascia which lines the interior of the abdommal and i>elvic cavities, and is directly continuous witli the iliac and pelvic lascias. ^ In the inguinal region, the transversalis fascia is thick and dense in structure, and joined by fibres from the aponeurosis of the Transversalis ; but it becomes thin and cellular as it ascends to the Diaphragm. Below, it has the following attachments : external to the femoral vessels, it is connected to the posterior margin of Poupart's ligament, and is there continuous with the iliac fascia. Internal to the vessels it is thin, and attached to the pubes and pectineal line, behind the conjoined tendon, with which it is united; and, corresponding to the points where the femoral vessels pass into the thigh, this fascia descends in front of them, forming the anterior wall of the crural sheath. The mtemal aldominal ring is situated in the transversalis fascia, midway tetween the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the pubes, and about half an inch above Poupart's ligament. It is of an oval form, the extremi- ties of the oval directed upwards and downwards, varies in size in different subjects, and is much larger in the male than in the female. It is bounded, above, by the arched fibres of the Trensversalis muscle, and internally, by the epigastric vessels. It transmits the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female, and from its circumference a thin, funnel-shaped membrane, tJie infimdiiuliform fascia, is continued round the cord and testis, enclosing them in a distinct pouch. When the sac of an oblique inguinal hernia passes through the internal ring, the infundibuliform process of the transversalis fascia forme one of its coverings. Between the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum, is a quantity of loose • areolar tissue. In some subjects it is. of considerable thickness, and loaded with734 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. adipose tissue. Opposite the intornal ring, it is continued round the surface of the cord, forming a loose sheath for it. The epigastric crtery bears a very impoi-tant relation to the internal abdominal ring. This vessel lies between the transversalis fascia and peritoneum, and passes obliquely upwards and inwards, from its origin from the external iliac, to the mai"gia of the sheath of the Rectus muscle. In this course it lies along the lower and inner mai-gin of the internal ring, and beneath the commencement of the spermatic cord, the vas deferens curving round it as it passes from the ring into the pelvis. The 2>eritonev/in, corresponding to the inner surface of the internal ring, pre- sents a well-mai'ked depression, the depth of which varies in different subjects. A thin fibrous band is continued from it along the front of the cord, for a variable distance, and becomes ultimately lost. This is the remains of the pouch of peritoneum which, in the foetus, accompanies the cord and testis into the scrotum the obliteratiou of which commences soon after birth. In some cases, the fibrous band can only be traced a short distance ; but occasionally, it may be followed as a fine cord, as far as the upper end of the tunica vaginalis. Sometimes the tube of peritoneum is only closed at intervals, and presents a sacculated appearance; or a single pouch may extend along the whole length of the cord, which may be closed above; or the pouch may be directly continuous with the peritoneum by an opening at its upper part. Inguinal Hernu. Inguinal hernia is that form of protrusion which makes its way through the abdomen in the inguinal region. There are two principal varieties of inguinal hernia : external or oblique, and internal or direct. External, or oblique inguinal hernia, the more frequent of the two, takes the same course as the spermatic cord. It is called external, from the neck of the sac being on the outer or iliac side of the epigastric artery. Internal, or direct inguinal hernia, does not follow the same course as the cord, but protrudes through, the abdominal wall on the inner or pubic side of the epigastric artery. Oblique Inguinal Hernia. In oblique inguinal hernia, the intestine escapes from the abdominal cavity at the internal ring, pushing before it a pouch of peritoneum, which forms the hernial sac. As it enters the inguinal canal, it receives an investment from the subserous areolar tissue, and is enclosed in the infundibuliform process of the transversalis fascia. In passing along the inguinal canal, it displaces upwards the arched fibres of the Transversalis and Internal obHque muscles, and is sur- rounded by the fibres of the Cremaster. It then passes along the front of the cord, and escapes from the inguinal canal at the external ring, receiving an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. Lastly, it descends into the scrotum, receiving coverings from the superficial fascia and the integument. The coverings of this form of hernia, after it has passed through the external ring, are, from without inwards, the integument, superficial fascia, intercolumnar fascia, Cremaster muscle, infundibuliform fascia, subserous cellular tissue, and peritoneum. j j This form of hernia lies in front of the vessels of the spermatic cord, and seldom extends below the testis, on account of the intimate adhesion of the coveriuo-s of the cord to the tunica vaginalis. The'seat of strict^cre in oblique inguinal hernia, is either at the external ring, in the ino-uinal canal, caused by the fibres of the Internal oblique or Transversahs, or at the°internal ring, more frequently in the latter situation. If it is situated at the external ring, the division of a few fibres at one point of its circumference, is735 DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA. all that is necessary for the replacement of the hernia. If m the mgumal canal, or at the internal ring, it will be necessary to divide the aponeurosis of the External oblique so as to lay open the inguinal canal. In dividing the stricture, the direction of the incision should be directly upv/ards. When the intestine passes along the spermatic canal, and escapes from the external ring into the scrotum, it is called complete oblique inguinal, or scrotal Jieniia. If the intestine does not escape from the external ring, but is retained m the inguinal canal, it is called i/iicomplete inguinal hernia or huhonocele. In each of these cases, the coverings which invest it will depend upon the extent to which it descends in the inguinal canal. There are two other varieties of oblique inguinal hernia: the congenital, and infantile. Congenital hernia is liable to occur in those cases where the pouch of perito- neum which accompanies the cord and testis in its descent in the foetus remains unclosed, and communicates directly with the peritoneum. The intestine descends along this pouch into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, and lies in contact with the testis. This form of hernia has no proper sac, being contained within the tunica vaginahs. In Infantile hernia, the hernial sac descends along the inguinal canal into the scrotum, behind the pouch of peritoneum which accompanies the cord and testis into the same part. The abdominal aperture of this pouch is closed, but the portion contained in the inguinal canal remains unobliterated. The hernial sac is consequently invested, more or less completely, by the posterior layer of the tunica vaginalis from which it is separated by a Httle loose areolar tissue: so that in operating upon this variety of hernia, three layers of peritoneum would require division; the first and second being the layers of the tunica vaginalis, the third the anterior layer of the hernial sac. DiEECT Inguinal Hernu. In direct inguinal hernia, the protrusion makes its way through some part of the abdominal wall internal to the epigastric artery, and passes directly through the abdominal parietes and external ring. At the lower part of the abdominal waU is a triangular space (Hesselbach's triangle), bounded, externally, by the epigastric artery ; internally, by the margin of the Rectus muscle ; below, by Poupart's ligament. The conjoined tendon is stretched across the inner two- thirds of this space, the remaining portion of the space being filled in by the transversahs fascia. In some cases the hernial protrusion escapes from the abdomen on the outer side of the conjoined tendon, pushing before it the peritoneum, the subserous cel- lular tissue, and the transversalis fascia. It then enters the inguinal canal, passing along nearly its whole length, and finally emerges fi'om the external ring, receiving an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. The coverings of this form of hernia are precisely similar to those investing the oblique form.* * The difference between the position of the neck of the sac in these two forms of direct inguinal hernia has been referred, with some probability, to a difference m the relative posi- tions of the obliterated hypogastric artery and the epigastric artery. The projection of the hypogastric artery towards the cavity of the abdomen produces two fossce in the peritoneum. When the course of the obliterated hypogastric artery corresponds pretty nearly with that of the epigastric, which is regarded as the normal arrangement, the bottom of the external fossa of the peritoneum corresponds to the position of the uiternal abdominal ring; and a hernia which distends and pushes out the peritoneum lining this fossa is an oblique hernia. When, on the other hand, the obliterated hypogastric artery lies considerably to the inner side of the epigastric, it divides the triangle of Ilesselbach into two pai-ts. In that case a hernia ma_y distend and push out the peritoneum forming the bottom of the external fossa, and by so doing will protrude the tissues which form the abdommal wall between the internal ring and the conjoined tendon. It will be a direct hernia, since the neck of the sac lies internal to the epigastric artery : but its coverings, as stated in the text, will be identical with those of the oblique form, with the insignificant difference that the covering from the transveraahs fascia is taken from another source, and not from its iufundibuliform process.736 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. In other cases, and this is the moi'e frequent variotj', the intestine is either forced through the Hbrcs of the coujoiued tendon, or the tendon is gradually dis- tended iu front of it, so as to form a complete investment for it. The intestine then enters the lower end of the inguinal canal, escapes at the external ring lying on the inner side of the cord, and receives additional coverings from the superficial fascia and the integument. This form of hernia has the same coverings as the oblique variety, excepting that the conjoined tendon is substituted for the Cremaster, and the infundibulura fascia is replaced by a part of the general fascia transveraalis. The seat of stricture in both varieties of direct hernia is most frequently at the ^ neck of the sac, or at the external ring. In that form of hernia which perforates the conjoined tendon, it not unfrequently occurs at the edges of the fissure througli which the gut passes. In dividing the stricture, the incision should in all cases be directed upwards. If the hernial protrusion passes into the inguinal canal, but does not escape from the external abdominal ring, it forms what is called incomplete clired hernia. This form of hernia is usually of small size, and in corpulent persons very difficult of detection. Direct inguinal hernia is of much less frequent occurrence than the oblique, their comparative frequency being, according to Cloquet, as one to five. It occurs far more frequently in men than in women, on account of the larger size of the external ring in the former sex. It differs from the oblique in its smaller size and globular form, dependent most probably on the resistance offered to its progress by the transversalis fascia and conjoined tendon. It differs also in its position, being placed over the pnbes, and not in the course of the inguinal canal. The epio-astric artery runs on the outer or iliac side of the neck of the sac and the "spermatic cord along its external and posterior side, not directly behind it, as in oblique inguinal hernia.

The internal saphenous vein is a vessel of considerable size which ascends obliquely upwards along the inner side of the thigh, below Poupart's ligament. It passes through the saphenous opening in the fescia lata to terminate in the femoral vein. This vessel is accompanied by numerous lymphatics, which return the lymph from the dorsum of the foot and inner side of the leg and thigh : they ter- minate in the inguinal glands, which surround the saphenous opening. Diverging from the same point are the superficial epigastric vessels, which mn across Poupart's hgament, obliquely upwards and inwards, to the lower part of the abdomen; the superficial circumflexa ilii vessels, which pass obliquely outwards 400.—Femoral Tlcinin. Superficial Dissection. along Poupart's ligament to the crest of the ilium; and the superficial external pudic vessels, whicb pass inwards to the perinasum and scrotum. These vessels supply the subcutaneous areolar tissue and the integument, and are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels, whicb return the lymph from the same parts to the inguinal glands. The superficial inguinal glands are an-anged in two groups, one of which is disposed above and parallel with Poupart's ligament, and the other below the ligament, surrounding the termination of the saphenous vein, and followino- (occasionally) the course of that vessel a short distance along the thigh.

The Fascia Lata, already described (p. 296), is a dense fibrous aponourosis, which forms a uniform investment for the whole of this region of the limb. At the upper and inner part of the thigh, a large oval-shaped aperture is observed in it; it transmits the internal saphenous vein and other small vessels, and is called the saphenous opening. In order the more correctly to consider the mode ot formation of this aperture, the fascia lata in this part of the thigh is described as consisting of two portions, an iliac poi'iion, and a pubic portion. The iliac portion of the fascia lata is situated on the outer side of the saphenous opening covering the outer surface of the Sartorius, the Rectus, and the Psoas and Iliacus muscles. It is attached externally to the crest of the ilium and its anterior superior spine, to the whole length of Poupart's ligament as far internally as the spine of the pubes, and to the pectineal line iu conjunction with Gimber- nat's ligament, where it becomes continuous with the pubic portion. Prom the spine of the pubes, it is reflected downwards and outwards, forming an arched margin, the outer boundary (superior cormi) of the saphenous opening. This is sometimes called the falciform process of the fascia lata (femoral ligament of Hey) ; it overlies, and is adherent to, the sheath of the femoral vessels beneath; to its edge is attached the cribriform fascia, and it is continuous below with the pubic portion of the fascia lata by a well-defined curved margin. The pubic portion of the fascia lata is situated at the inner side of the saphe- nous opening: at the lower margin of this aperture, it is continuous with the iliac portion : traced upwards, it covers the surface of the Pectineus, Adductor longus, and Gracilis muscles; and passing behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, to which it is closely united, is continuous with the sheath of the Psoas and Iliacus muscles, and is finally lost in the fibrous capsule of the hip-joint. This fascia is attached above to the pectineal line, and internally to the margin of the pubic arch. It may be observed from this description that the iliac portion of the fascia lata passes in front of the femoral vessels, the pubic portion behind them ; an apparent aperture consequently exists between the two, through which the internal saphenous joins the femoral vein. The Saphenous Opening is an oval-shaped aperture, measuring about an inch and a half in length, and half an inch in width. It is situated at the upper and inner part of the thigh, below Poupart's ligament, towards the inner side, and is directed obliquely downwards and outwards. Its outer margin is of a semilunar form, thin, strong, sharply defined, and Hes on a plane considerably anterior to the inner margin. If this edge is traced up- wards, it will be seen to form a curved elongated process or cornu (the superior cornu), or falciform process of Burns, which ascends in front of the femoral vessels, and curving inwards, is attached to Poupart's ligament and to the spine of the pubes and pectineal line, where it is continuous with the pubic portion.* * It is difficult to perceive in the recognised description of these ligaments (Key's and Burns's) any difiCTence between the two; nor is it clear what structure Mr. Hey really intended to describe. Mi. Gay (on 'Femoral Supiure,'^. 16) gives very cogent reasons for thinking that the ' deep crural arch' was the structure which Hey had iu view. The most recent writer on Femoral Hernia speaks thus while treating of these parts: 'The whole upper edge of the iliac fascia lata is commonly called the "thlciform process," whilst Its deeper fibres receive the name of " Burns's ligament." Hey's femoral ligament would appear to consist of distinct fibres connected with the inner fold of the iliac fascia, which extend immediately beneath the tendon of the external oblique to the subperitoneal LLLRNDER, ' On the Anatomi/ of the Parts Concerned in Femoral Jtunture' p. ig, extend imm fascia.' (Call no rru- 1 f-t-^ w«-, K^oncernea m Ji'emm-ai Jiunture, ^. IQ, ite.) Ihis description of Hey's ligament accords closelv with that of the deep crural arcli, for the subperitoneal fascia is Mr. Oalleuder's naine for the fascia transversalis. Mr. Lallcnder goes on to say,—'The upper border of tliis (saphenous) opening thus receives by an unfortunate comphcation, the names of "Falciform process,^' "Femoral ligament; " Burns s or Hey's ligament." The various divisions of the iliac fascia lata depend in great measure upon the skill of the dissector, and are, m my opinion, 3 B 2-740 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. If traced downwards, it is found continuous with anotlier curved margin, tlie concavity of wliicli is directed npwards and inwards ; this is the inferior conm of the saphenous opening, and is blended witli the pubic portion of the fascia lata covering the Pectineus muscle. The inner houndarij of tlio opening is on a plane posterior to the out«r margin and behind the level of the femoral vessels ; it is much less promment and dehned than the outer, from being stretched over the subjacent Pectineus muscle. It is |, through the saphenous opening that a femoral hernia passes after descending along the crural canal. , ., j, v -u • a If the linger is introduced into the saphenous opening while the limb is movea , in different directions, the aperture will be found to be greatly constricted on extending the limb, or rotating it outwards, and to be relaxed on flexmg the limb and inverting it: hence the necessity of placing the limb in the latter position in employing the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia. The iliac portion of the fascia lata, together with its falciform process, should now be removed, by detaching it from the lower margin of Poupart s ligament carefully dissecting it from the'subjacout structures, and turning it aside when the sheath of the femoral ^e8Scl8 is exposed descending beneath Poupart's ligament (fig. 402). 402.-Femoral Hernia.

Nearly tl.e whole of tbe space included betvveen the crural arch and innominate bone is filled in by the parts which descend from the abdomen into the thigh. The outer half of the space is occupied by the Iliacus and Psoas muscles, together with the external cutaneous and anterior crural nerves The pubic side of the space is occupied by the femoral vessels included m their sheath, a small oval-shaped interval existing between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the sheath, which is occupied merely by a little loose areolar tissue, and occasionally by a small lymphatic gland ; this is the crural canal, along which the gut descends in femoral hernia. Ghnheniat's Ligament (fig. 403) is that part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle which is reflected downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the pectineal lino of the os pubis. It is about an inch in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost horizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form, the base directed outwards. Its base, or outer margin, is concave, thin and sharp, lies in contact with the crural sheath, and is blended with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its ajpex corresponds to the spine of the pubes. Its posterior margin is attached to the pectineal line. Its anterior margin is con- tinuous with Poupart's ligament. Crural Sheath. If Poupart's ligament is divided, the femoral or crural sheath may be demonstrated as a continuation downwards of the fascias that line the abdomen, the transveraalis fascia passing down in front of the femoral vessels, and the iliac fascia descending behind them ; these fasciaa are directly continuous on the iliac side of the femoral artery, but a small sjpace exists between the femoral vein and the point where they are continuous on the pubic side of that vessel, which constitutes the femoral or crural canal. The femoral sheath is closely adherent to the contained vessels about an inch below the saphenous opening, becoming blended with the areolar sheath of the vessels, but opposite Poupart's ligament it is much larger than is required to contain them; hence the funnel- shaped form which it presents. The outer border of the sheath is perforated by the genito-crural nerve. Its inner border is pierced by the internal saphenous vein, and numerous lymphatic vessels. In front, it is covered by the iliac portion of the fascia lata ; and behind it is the pubic portion of the same fascia. Beep Crural Arch. Passing across the front of the crural sheath, and closely connected with it, is a thickened band of fibres, called the deep crural arch. It is apparently a thickening of the fascia transversalis, joining externally to the centre of Poupart's ligament, and arching across the front of the crural sheath, to be inserted by a broad attachment into the pectineal line, behind the conjoined tendon. In some subjects, this structure is not very prominently marked, and not unfrequcntly it is altogether wanting. If the anterior wall of the sheath is removed, the femoral artery and vein are seen lying side by side, a thin septum separating the two vessels, and another septum separates the vein from the inner wall of the sheath. The septa are stretched between the anterior and posterior walls of the sheath, so that each vessel is enclosed in a separate compartment. The interval left betvveen the vein and the inner wall of the sheath is not filled up by any structure, excepting a little loose areolar tissue, a few lymphatic vessels, and occasionally a lymphatic gland; this is the femoral or crural canal, through which a portion of intestine descends iu femoral hernia. The crural canal is the narrow interval between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the crural sheath. It exists as a distinct canal only when the sheath has been separated from the vein by dissection, or by the pressure of a hernia or tumour. Its length is from a quarter to half an inch, and it extends from G imbernat's liga- ment to the upper part of the saphenous opening. Its anterior wall is very nax-row, and formed by the fascia transversalis, Poupart's ligament, and the falciform process of the fascia lata. Its posterior wall is formed by the iliac fascia and the pubic portion of the fascia lata.742 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. Its outer loall is formed by ilio libi-ous septum covering the inner side of tlie femoral vein. Its inner loall is formed by tlio junction of tlie transversalis and iliac fasciaj, whicb form the inner side of tlie femoral sheatli, and cover the outer edge of Girabernat's ligament. This canal has two oi-ificcs: a lower one, the saphenous opening, closed by the cribriform fascia ; an upper one, the femoral or crural ring, closed by the septum crurale. 403.—Ilemiii. The Relations of the Femoral and Infernal Abdominal Rings, seen from witliin tlio Abdomen. Rijilit Side. The femoral or crural ring (fig. 403) is the upper opening of the femoral canal and leads into the cavity of the abdomen.* It is bounded in front by Ponpart's ligament and a deep crural arch ; behind by the pubes, covered by the Pecttneus muscle, and the pubic portion of the fascia lata; internally, by Gimbernat's lio'ament, the conjoined tendon, the transversalis fascia, and the deep crural arch ; externally, by the femoral vein, covered by its sheath. The femoral ring is of an oval form; its long diameter, directed transversely, measures about half an inch, and it is larger in the female than in the male, which is one of the reasons of the greater frequency of femoral hernia in the former sex. Position of Farts around tlio Bing. The spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female, lie immediately above the anterior margin of the femoral ring, and may be divided in an operation for femoral hernia if the incision for the relief of the stricture is not of limited extent. In the female, this is of little importance, but in the male the spermatic artery and vas deferens may be divided. The fem,oral vein lies on the outer side of the ring. The epigastric artery, in its passage inwards from the external iliac to the umbilicus, passes across the upper and outer angle of the crural ring, and is con- sequently in danger of being wounded if the stricture is divided in a direction upwards and outwards. The communicating hranch between the epigastric and obturator lies in front of the ring. • This rinsr, like the crural canal, is a morbid or an artifioinl product. ' Each femor.il hernia makes for itself (for neith'.r outlet e.vists in the nnlural anatomy of the region) a crural canal, and a crural (femoral) ring.'—Callendkr, op. at., p. 4°-FEMORAL Hl^^NIA. 743 Tbo circumfevence of the ring is tlms seen to be boundod by vessels ,n every part, excepting iaiternally and behind.

The oUuralor artery, .vhen it arises by a common trunk with the ep>gastx.c, which occurs once in every three subjects and a half, bears a very mpor ant rela- tion to tbo crural ring. In some cases it descends on the inner side of the exter- nal iliac vein to the obturator foramen, and will consequently he on the_ outer side of the crural ring, Avbere there is no danger of its being woiinded m the operation for dividing the stricture in femoral bernia. (See fig. 228, p. 402, ist fio- ) Occasionally, however, tbo obturator artery curves along tbe free margin ot Gimbernat's ligament in its passage to tbe obturator fdramen; it would, conse- quently, skirt along tbe greater part of the circumference of the crural canal, and could hardly avoid being wounded in tbe operation. (See fig. 228, p. 402, 2ud fig.) Sej)tum Grurale. The femoral ring is closed by a layer of condensed areolar tissue, called, by J. Cloquet, the sepum crurala. This serves as a barrier io the protrusion of a hernia through this part. Its upper surface is slightly concave, and supports a small lymphatic gland, by which it is separated from the subserous areolar tissue and peritoneum. Its under surface is turned towards the femoral canal. The septum crurale is perforated by numerous apertures for the passage of lymphatic vessels, connecting the deep inguinal glands with those surrounding the external iliac artery. The size of the femoral canal, the degree of tension of its orifices, and, con- sequently, the degree of constriction of a hernia, vary according to the position of the limb. If the leg and thigh are extended, abducted, or everted, the femoral canal and its orifices are rendered tense, from the traction on these parts by Poupart's ligament and the fascia lata, as may be ascertained by passing the finger along the canal. If, on the contrary, the thigh is fixed upon the pelvis, and, at the same time, adducted and rotated inwards, the femoral canal and its orifices become considerably relaxed ; for this reason, the limb should always be placed in the latter position when the application of the taxis is made in attempting the reduction of a femoral hernia. The septum crurale is separated from the peritoneum by a quantity of loose subserous areolar tissue. In some subjects, this tissue contains a considerable amount of adipose substance, which, when protruded forwards in front of the sac of a femoral hernia, may be mistaken for a portion of omentum. Descent of the Hernia. Prom the preceding description it follows, that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the abdominal wall ; hence it is, that when violent or long-continued pressure is made upon the abdominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced into it, constituting a femoral hernia; and the changes in the tissues of the abdomen which are produced by pregnancy, together with the larger size of this aperture in the female, serve to explain the frequency of this form of hernia in women. When a portion of intestine is forced through the femoral ring, it carries before it a pouch of peritoneum, which forms what is called the hernial sac ; it receives an investment from the subserous areolar tissue, and from, the septum crurale, and descends vertically along the crural canal in the inner compartment of the sheath of the femoral vessels as far as the saphenous opening: at this point, it changes its course, being prevented from extending further down the sheath, on account of tbe narrowing of the sheath and its close contact with the vessels, and also from the close attachment of the superficial fascia and crural sheath to the lower part of the circumference of the saphenous opening; the tumour is, consequently, directed forwards, pushing before it the cribriform fascia, and then curves upwards on to the falciform process of the fascia lata and lower part of the tendon of the External oblique, being covered by the superficial fascia and integument. "While the hernia is contained in the femoral canal, it is usually of small size, owing to the resisting nature of the surrounding parts; but when it luis escaped from the saphenous opening into the loose areolar tissue of the groin, it becomes considerably enlarged744 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. The direction taken by a femoral hernia in its descent is at first downwards, then forwards and upwai-ds ; tliis should bo borne in mind, as in the application of the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia, pressure should be directed in the reverse order. Coverings of the Hernia. The coverings of a femoral hernia from within out- wards are peritoneum, subserous areolar tissue, the septum crurale, crural sheath, cribriform fascia, superficial fascia, and integument.* Varieties of Femoral Hernia. If the intestine descends along the femoral canal only as far as the saphenous opening, and does not escape from this aperture, it is called incomplete femoral hernia. The small size of the protrusion in this form of hernia, on account of the firm and resisting natui-e of the canal in which it is contained, renders it an exceedingly dangerous variety of the disease, from the extreme difficulty of detecting the existence of the swelling, especially in corpulent subjects. The coverings of an incomplete femoral hernia would be, from without inwards, integument, superficial fascia, falciform process of fascia lata, fascia propria, septum crurale, subserous cellular tissue, and peritoneum. When, how- ever, the hernia tumour protrudes through the saphenous opening, and directs itself forwards and upwards, it forms a complete femoral hernia. Occasionally, the hernial sac descends on the iliac side of the femoral vessels, or in front of these vessels, or even sometimes behind them. The seat of stricture of a femoral hernia varies: it may be in the peritoneum at the neck of the hernial sac ; in the greater number of cases it would appear to be at the point of junction of the falciform process of the fascia lata with the lunated edge of Gimbernat's ligament; or at the margin of the saphenous opening in the thigh. The stricture should in every case be divided in a direction upwards and inwards ; and the extent necessary to the majority of cases is about two or three lines. By these means, all vessels or other structures of importance, in relation with the neck of the hernial sac, will be avoided. * Sir A. Cooper has described an investment for femoral hernia under the name of 'Fascia propria,' lying immediately external to the peritoneal sac, but frequently separated from it by more or less adipose tissue. Surgically, it is important to remember the existence (at any rate, the occasional existence) of this layer, on account of the ease with which an inexperienced operator may mistake the fascia for the peritoneal sac, and the contained fat for omentum. Anatomically, this fascia appears identical with what is called in the text ' subserous areolar tissue,' the areolar tissue being thickened and caused to assume a membranous appearance, by the pressure of the hernia.Surgical Anatomy of the Periiiseum and Ischio- Eectal Eegion. Dissection. The student should select a well-developed muscular subject, free from fat, and the dissection should be commeuced early, in order that the parts may be examined in as recent a state as possible. A staff having been introduced into the bladder, and the subject placed in the position shown in tig. 404, the scrotum should be raised upwards, and retained in that position, and the rectum moderately distended with tow. The space whicli is now exposed, corresponds to the inferior aperture, or outlet of the pelvis. Its deep boundaries are, in front, the pubic ax-ch and subpubic ligament; behind, the tip of the coccyx ; and on each side, the ramus of the pubes and ischium, the tuberosity of the ischium, and great sacro-sciatic ligament. The space included by these boundaries is somewhat lozenge-shaped, and is limited on the surface of the body by the scrotum, in front, by the buttocks behind, and on each side by the inner side of the thighs. It measures, from before backwards, about four inches, and about three in the broadest part of its transverse diameter, between the ischial tuberosities. A line drawn transversely between the anterior part of the tuberosity of the ischium, on each side, in front of the anus, subdivides this space into two portions. The anterior portion contains the penis and urethra, and is called the perinceum. The posterior portion contains the termination of the rectum, and is called the isclvio-rectal region. Ischio-Rectal Region. The ischio-rectal region corresponds to the portion of the outlet of the pelvis situated immediately behind the perinseum : it contains the termination of the rectum. A deep fossa, filled with fat, is seen on either side of the intestine, between it and the tuberosity of the ischium: this is called the itchio-rectal fossa. The iscJiio-redal region presents, in the middle line, the aperture of the anus; around this orifice, the integument is thrown into numerous folds, which are obliterated on distension of the intestine. The integument is of a dark colour, continuous with the mucous membrane of the rectum, and provided with numerous follicles, which occasionally inflame and snppurate, and may be mistaken for fistulas. The veins around the margin of the anus are occasionally much dilated, forming a number of hard, pendent masses, of a dark bluish colour, covered partly by mucous membrane, and partly by the integument. These tumours constitute the disease called external piles. Dissection. Make an incision through the integument, along the median line, from the base of the scroUmi to the anterior extremity of the anus; carry it round the mam-ins of this aperture to its posterior extremity, and continue it backwards about an inch behfnd the tip of the coccyx. A transverse incision should now be carried across the base of the scrotum, joining the anterior extremity of the preceding; a second, carried in the same direction, should be made in front of the anus; and a third at the posterior extremity of the gut. These incisions should be sufficiently extensive to enable the dissector to raise tlie integument from the inner side of the thighs. The flaps of skin corresponding to the ischio-rectal region (fig. 404—8), should now be removed. In dissecting the integument from this region, great care is required, otherwise the External sphincter will be removed, as it is intimately ad- herent to the skm. The S2iperficial fascia is exposed on the removal of the skin: is is very thick, areolar in texture, and contains much fat in its meshes. In it are found ramifyingSURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. 746 two ov three cutaiioous brandies of tlio small sciatic nerve ; these turn ronn-I the inferior border of the Gluteus maxinius, and are distributed to the integument in this region. , 404.—DiasocLion of Poriiucum and Iscliio-Ilectal Region. The External sphincter is a thin flat plane of muscular fibres, elliptical in shape, and intimately adherent to the integaiment surrounding the margin of the anus. It measures about three or four inches in length, from its anterior to its posterior extremity, being about an inch in breadth, ojDposite the anus. It arises from the tip of the coccyx, by a narrow tendinous band ; and from the superficial fascia in front of that bone ; and is inserted into the tendinous centre of the periuEeum, joining with the Transversus perinosi, the Levator ani, and the Acce- lerator urinte. Like other Sphincter muscles, it consists of two planes of muscular fibre, which surround the margin of the anus, and join in a commissure before and behind. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the integument; by its deep surface, it is in contact with the Internal sphincter ; and is separated from the Levator ani by loose areolar tissue. The Sphincter ani is a voluntary muscle, supplied by the hajmorrhoidal branch of the fourth sacral nerve. This muscle is divided in the operation for fistiila in ano ; and also in some cases of fissure of the rectum, especially if attended with much pain or spasm. The object of its division is to keep the parts at rest and in contact during the healing process. The Internal sphincter is a muscular ring, about an inch in breadth, which surrounds the lower extremity of the rectum, about an inch fi-om the margm of the anus. This muscle is about two lines in thickness, and is formed by an aggregation of the involuntary circular fibres of the intestine. It is paler in colour^ and less coarse in texture, than the External sphincter. The iscMo-rectal fossa is situated between the end of the rectum and the tuberosity of tlie ischium on each side. It is triangular in shape, its base, directed to the surface of the body, is formed by the integument of the ischio-rectal region ; • its apex, directed upwards, corresponds to the point of divi&ion of the obturator fascia and the thin membrane given ofi" from it, which covers the outer surface of the Levator ani (ischio-rectal fascia). Its dimensions are about an inch 111 breadth at the base, and about two inches in depth, being deeper behind than m front It is bounded, internally, by the Sphincter ani.

This space is filled with a large mass of adipose substance, which explains the frequency with which abscesses in the neighbourhood of the rectum burrow to a considerable depth. If the subject has been injected, on placing the finger on the outer wall of this fossa, the internal pudic artery, with its accompanying veins and nerve, will be felt about an inch and a half above the margin of the ischiatic tuberosity, but approaching nearer the surface as they pass forwards along the inner margm of the pubic arch. These structures are enclosed in a sheath formed by the obturator fascia, the pudic nerve lying below the artery. Crossing the space transversely, about its centre, are the inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels and nerves, branches of the pudic ; they are distributed to the integument of the anus, and to the muscles of the lower end of the rectum. These vessels are occasionally of larger size, and may give rise to troublesome hjemorrhage, when divided in the operation of litho- tomy, or of fistula in ano. At the back part of this space may be seen a branch of the fourth sacral nerve; and, at the fore part of the space, a cutaneous branch of the perinasal nerve. Peein-sum. The perinseal space is of a triangular form ; its deep boundaries are limited, laterally, by the rami of the pubes and ischia, meeting in front at the pubic arch ; behind, by an imaginary transverse line, extending between the tuberosities of the ischia. The lateral boundaries vary, in the adult, from three inches to three inches and a half in length; and the base from two to three inches and a half in breadth ; the average extent of the base being two inches and three-quarters. The variations in the diameter of this space are of extereme interest in. connection with the operation of lithotomy, and the extraction of a stone from the cavity of the bladder. In those cases where the tuberosities of the ischia are near together, it would be necessary to make the incisions in the lateral operation of lithotomy less oblique than if the tuberosities were widely separated, and the perinjeal space, consequently, wider. The perinseum is subdivided by the median raphe into two equal parts. Of these, the left is the one in which the operation of lithotomy is performed. In the middle line, the perinsBum is convex, and corresponds to the bulb of the urethra. The skin covering it is of a dark colour, thin, freely moveable upon the subjacent parts, and covered with sharp crisp hairs which should be removed before the dissection of the part is commenced. In front of the anus, a prominent line commences, the raphe, continuous in front with the raphe of the scrotum. The flaps of integument corresponding to this space having been removed, in the manner shown in figs. 404—7, the superficial fascia is exposed. The Superficial Fascia consists of two layers, superficial and deep, as in other regions of the body. The superficial layer is thick, loose, areolar in texture, and contains much adipose tissue in its meshes, the amount of which varies in different subjects. In front it is continuous with the dartos of the scrotum ; behind, it is continuous with the subcutaneous areolar tissue surrounding the anus ; and, on either side, with the same fascia on the inner side of the thighs. This layer should be care- fully removed, after it has beeu examined, when the deep layer will be exposed. The deep layer of superficial fascia (superficial perinoeal fascia) is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength, serving to bind down the ' muscles of the root of the penis. It is continuous, in front, with the dartos of the scrotum; on either side, it is firmly attached to the margins of the rami of the pubes and ischium, external to the crus penis, and as far back as the tuberosity of the ischium ; posteriorly it curves down behind the Transversus periuaji mu.scles to join the lower margin of the deep perinoeal fascia. This fascia not only covers the muscles in this region, but sends down a vertical septum from its under sur- face, which separates the back part of the subjacent space into two, being incom- plete in front.SURGICAL ANATOMY OP THE PERINEUM. 748 Ill rupt,ure of the anterior portion of the nretlira, accompanied by extravasation of urine, tbo fluid makes its way forwards, beneath this fascia, into the areolar tissue of the scrotum, penis, and anterior and lateral portions of the abdomen; it rarely extends into the areolar tissue on tlie inner side of the thighs, or backwards around the anus. This limitation of the extravaaatod fluid to the parts above- named is easy of explanation, when the attachments of the deep layer of the ^05.—The PeviniEiiiii. Tlie Intogiimcnt and Siiperlicial Layer o£ Siiperlicial Fii.scia rellected. superficial fascia are considered. When this fascia is removed the muscles con- nected with the penis and urethra will be exposed ; these are, in the middle line, the Accelerator urinse ; on each side, the Erector penis, and behind the Trans- versus perinasi. The Accelerator urince is placed in the middle line of the perninjeum, immedi- ately in front of the anus. It consists of two symmetrical halves, united along the median line by a tendinous raphe. It arises from the central tendon of the perlnseum, and from the median raphe in front. From this point its fibres diverge like the plumes of a pen ; the most posterior form a thin layer, which are lost on the anterior surface of the triangular ligament; the middle fibres encircle the bulb and adjacent part of the corpus spongiosum, and join with the fibres of the op])o- site side, on the upper part of the corpus spongiosum, in a strong aponeurosis ; the anterior'fibres, the longest and most distinct, spread out over the sides of the cor- pus cavemosum, to be inserted partly into that body, anterior to the Erector penis; partly terminating in a tendinous expansion, which covers the dorsal vessels of the penis. The latter fibres are best seen by dividing the muscle longitudinally, and dissecting it outwards from the surface of the urethra. Action This muscle may serve to accelerate the-flow of the urine or semen alontr the' canal of the urethra. The middle fibres are supposed, by Kninse, to assist in the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by compres.sing the erectile tissue of the bulb. The anterior fibres, according to Tyrrel, also contribute to theTRANSVP]BSUS PERIN^I. 749 erection of the penis, as they ai^ inserted into and continuous with, the fascia of ertowuu ui tuu p .

From these points, fleshy fibres succeed, which end in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the side a'nd under surface of the crus penis. This muscle compresses the crus penis, and thas serves to maintain the organ erect. The Transversus Perincei is a narrow muscular slip, which passes more or less transversely across the back part of the periuEeal space. It arises by a small tendon from the inner and fore side of the tuberosity of the ischium, and, passing obliquely forwards and inwards, is inserted into the central tendinous point of the perinseum, joining in this situation with the muscle of the opposite side, the Sphincter ani behind, and the Accelerator urines in front. Between the muscles just examined, a triangular space exists, bounded internally by the Accelerator urinte, externally by the Erector penis, and behind by the Transversus pei-insei. The floor of this space is formed by the triangular ligament of the urethra (deep perinaaal fascia), and, running from behind forwards in it, are the superficial perineaal vessels and nerves, the transverse perinaaal artery coursing along the posterior boundary of the space, on the Transversus perincei muscle. In the lateral operation of lithotomy, the knife is carried obliquely across the back part of this space, downwards and outwards, into the ischio-rectal fossa, dividing the Transversus pcrinasi muscle and artery, the posterior fibres of tho Accelerator urina), the superficial perina)al vessels and nerve, and more posteriorly the external hoemorrhoidal vessels.SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. 75° TIio superficial and transverse perinii3al arteries are described at p. 404 ; and the superficial porimeal and inferior pudendal nerves at jjp. 549, 551. The muscles of tbe porina3um in the female are, the Spliincter vaginas. Compressor urethrss. Erector clitoridis. Spliincter ani. Transvcrsus periniDi. Levator ani. Coccygous. The Sphincler VcujincB surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator iirinro in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perinieum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forward on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into tbe corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perinmi is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginas, and the Levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar to those in the male. The Accelerator uriuiB and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinjeal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 407.—Deep Perinaeal Fascia. On the left side, the anterior hiyer has been removed. The Deep PervncBal Fascia (triangular ligament), is a den.se membranous lamina, which closes the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and, on each side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, bcnt-ath the crura penis. Its inferiorLEVATOK ANI. 751 margin, or base, is directed towards the rectum, and connected to the central tendinous point of the perin«)am. It is continuous with tho deep layer of the superficial fascia behind the Transversus perina,i muscle, and with a thin fascia which covers tlie cutaneous surface of the Levator am muscle. . , , , The deep perinseal fascia is perforated by the urethra, about an inch below the symphysis pubis. The aperture is circular in form, and about three or four lines in diameter. Above this is the aperture for the dorsal vein of the penis ; and, outside the latter, the pudic nerve and artery pierce it. The deep perinceal fascia consists of two layers, anterior and posterior: tlicse are separated above, but united below. The anterior layer is continued forwards, around the anterior part of the mem- branous portion of the urethra becoming lost upon the bulb. The posterior layer is derived from the pelvic fascia : it is continued backwards around the posterior part of the membranous portion of the urethra, and the outer surface of the prostate gland. If the anterior layer of this fascia is detached on either side, the following parts are seen between it and the posterior layer: the subpubic ligament above, close to the pubes ; the dorsal vein of the penis ; the membranous portion of the urethra, and the muscles of the urethra; Cowper's glands and their ducts ; the pudic vessels and nerve ; the artery and nerve of the bulb, and a plexus of veins. The Compressor TTrethroi (constrictor urethrte), surrounds the whole length of the membranous portion of the urethra, and is contained between the two layers of the deep perinfeal fascia. It arises, by aponeurotic fibres, from the upper part of the ramus of the pubes on each side, to the extent of half or three-quarters of an inch; each segment of the muscle passes inwards, and divides into two fasciculi, which sui-round the urethra from the prostate gland behind, to the bulbous portion of the urethra in front; and unite, at the upper and lower surfaces of this tube, with the muscle of the opposite side, by means of a tendinous raphe. Circular Muscular Fibres surround the membranous portion of the urethra, from the bulb in front to the prostate gland behind ; they are placed immediately beneath the transverse fibres already described, and are continuous with the cir- cular fibres of the bladder. These fibres are involuntary. Coioper's Glands are situated immediately below the membranous portion of the urethra, close behind the bulb, and below the artery of the bulb (p. 707) The Pudic Vessels and Nerves are placed along the inner margin of the pubic arch (p. 402). The Artery of the Bulb passes transversely inwards, from the internal pudic along the base of the triangular ligament, between the two layers of fascia, accom- panied by a branch of the pudic nerve (p. 404). If the posterior layer of the deep perinieal fascia is removed, and the crus penis of one side detached from the bone, the under and perinseal surface of the Levator ani is brought fully into view. This muscle, with the triangular ligament in front and the Coccygeus and Pyriformis behind, closes in the outlet of the pelvis. The Levator ani is a broad thin muscle, situated on each side of the pelvis. It is attached to the inner surface of the sides of the true pelvis, and, descending, unites with its fellow of the opposite side to form the floor of the pelvic cavity. It supports the viscera in this cavity, and surrounds tho various structures which pass through it. It arises, in front from the posterior surface of the body and ramus of the pubes, on the outer side of the symphysis ; posteriorly, from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium: and between these two points, from the angle of division between the obturator and recto-vesical layers of the pelvic fascia at their under part: the fibres pass downwards to the middle line of tho floor of the pelvis, and are inserted, the most posterior fibres into the sides of the apex of the coccyx; those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side, in a median fibrous raphe, which extends between the coccyx and tho margin of tho anus. The middle fibres, which form the larger portion of tlie muscle, are inserted into the side of tho rectum, blending with tho fibres of tho752 SURGICAL A.NATOMT OF THE PERINEUM. Sphincter muscles ; lastly, tlio anterior libres, fclie longest, descend upon the side of the prostate gland to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, blending with the fibres of the external sphincter and Transversus perineei nauscles, at the tendinous centre of the porinsoum. The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by cellular tissue. From this circumstance, as well as from its peculiar relation with the prosiate gland, descending by its wide, and surrounding it as in a sling, it has been described by Santorini and others as a distinct muscle, under the name of the Levator prostatce. In the female, the anterior fibres of the Levator ani descend upon the sides of the vagina. 'Relations. By its wpfer or pelvic surface with the recto-vesical fascia, which separates it from the viscera of the pelvis and from the peritoneum. By its outer or perinceal surface, it forms the inner boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa, and is covered by a quantity of fat, and by a thiii layer of fascia continued from tlie obturator fascia. Its posterior harder is continuous with the Coccygeus muscle. Its antenor harder is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a triangular space, through which the urethra, and in the female the vagina, passes from the pelvis. Actions. This muscle supports the lower end of the rectum and vagina, and also the bladder during the efforts of expulsion. The Coccygeus is situated behind and parallel with the preceding. It is a triangular plane of muscular and tendinous fibres, arising, by its apex, from the spine of the ischium and lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and inserted, by its base, into the mai-gin of the coccyx and into the side of the lower piece of the sacrum. This muscle is continuous with the posterior border of the Levator ani, and closes in the back part of the outlet of the pelvis. Belations. By its imier or pelvic surface, with the rectum. By its external surface, with the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. By its posterior harder, with the Pyriformis. Action. The Coccygei muscles raise and support the coccyx, after it has been pressed backwards during defsecation or parturition. Position of the Viscera at the Ovtlet of the Fehis. Divide the central tendinous point of the perinfeum, separate the rectum from ite connections by dividing the fibres of the Levator ani, which descend upon the sides of the prostate gland, and draw the gut backwards towards the coccyx, when the under surface of the prostate gland, the neck and base of the bladder, the vesiculse seminales, and vasa deferentia will be exposed. The Prostate Gland is placed immediately in front of the neck of the bladder, around the prostatic portion of the urethra, its base being turned backwards, and its under surface towards the rectum. It is retained in its position by the Levator prostata and by the pubo-prostatic ligaments, and is invested by a dense fibrous covering, continued from the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia. The longest diameters of this gland are in the antero-posterior direction, and trans- versely at its base ; and hence the greatest extent of incision that can be made m it without dividing its substance completely across, is obliquely outwards and backwards. This is the direction in which the incision is made through it in the operation of lithotomy, the extent of which should seldom exceed an inch m length The relations of the prostate to the rectum should be noticed : by means of the finger introduced into the gut, the surgeon detects enlai-gement or other disease of this organ; he is enabled also, by the same means, todirect the point of a catheter when its introduction is attended with much difficulty, cither fi-om iniury or disease of the membranous or prostatic portious of the urethra. Behind the prostate is the posterior surface of the neck and base of the bladder; a small triangular portion of this organ is seen, bounded, in front by the prostate gland; behind, by the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum; on either side, by he LieuL seminales and vasa deferentia ; and separated from direct contac<> wi^^^^^^^^^ rectum by the recto-vesical fascia. The relation of this portion of the bladder io Te rectum is of extreme interest to the surgeon. In cases of retention of unne753 PARTS CONCELINED IN LITHOTOMY. this portion of the organ is found projecting into the rectum, between three and four inches from the margin of the anus, and may be easily perforated during life without injury to auy important parts ; this portion of the bladder is, consequently, 408—A View of the Position of the Viscera at the Outlet of the Pelvis. frequently selected for the performance of the operation of tapping the bladder. If the finger is introduced into the bowel, the surgeon may, in some cases, learn the position, as well as the size and weight, of a calculus in the bladder; and in the operation for its removal, if, as is not nnf requently the case, it should be lodged behind an enlarged prostate, it may be displaced from its position by pressing up- wards the base of the bladder from the rectum. ' Parts concerned in the Operation of Lithotomy. The triangular ligament must be replaced and the rectum drawn forwards so as to occupy its normal position. The student should then consider the position of the various parts in reference to the lateral operation of lithotomy. This operation is performed on the left side of the perinjEum, as it is most convenient for the right hand of the operator. A staff having been introduced into the bladder, the first incision is commenced midway between the anus and the back of the scrotum {i.e., in an ordinary adulf permteum, about an inch and a half in front of the anus), a little on the left side of the raphe, and can-ied obliquely backwards and outwards to midway between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium. The incision divides the integument and superficial fascia, the external hemorrhoidal vessels and nerves, and the superficial and transverse perinatal vessels; if the forefinger of the left hand is thrust upwards and forwards into the wound, pressing at the same time the rectum mwards and backwards, the staff may be felt in the membranous portion of the urethra. The finger is fixed upon the staff, and the structures covering it aro divided with the point of the knife, which must be directed along the groove towards the bladder, the edge of the knife beings carried outwards and backwards dividing in Its course the membranous portion of the urethrn, and part of the left lobe of the prostate gland, to the extent of about an inch. The knife is then 3 C754 PAETS CONCERNED IN LITHOTOMY. ,( witlidrawn, and the fore-linger of the left hand passed along the staff into the bladder: the staff having been withdrawn, and the position of the stone ascer- tained, the forceps are introduced over the finger into the bladder. If the stone is very laro-e, the opposite side of the prostate may bo notched before the forceps are introduced : the finger is now withdrawn, and the blades of the forceps opened and made to grasp the stone, which must be extracted by slow and cautious un- dulating movements. Paris divided in iho operation. The various structures divided in this operation are as follows :—the integument, superficial fascia, external hajmorrhoidal vessels and nerves, the posterior fibres of the Accelerator urines, the Transversus perinaji muscle and artery (and, probably, the superficial perinceal vessels and nerves), the deep perineal fascia, the anterior fibres of the Levator ani, part of the Compressor urethrte, the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra, and part of the prostate gland. 409.—A Transverse Section of the Pehis; showing; tbo Pelvic Fascia.

Such a proceeding has not unfreqaently occurred, producing the most embarrassing results, and total failaro of the operation. 410.—Side View of the Pelvic Viscera of the Male Snbjoct, showing the Pelvic and reiiiia3al Fasciiie. It is necessary to bear in mind that the arteries in the perineum occasionally take an abnormal cour.se. Thus the artery of the bulb, when it arises, as sometimes happens, from the pudic, opposite the tuber ischii, is liable to be wounded in the operation for hthotomy, in its passage forwards to the bulb. The accessory pudic may be divided near the posterior border of the prostate gland, if this is completely cnt across: and the prostatic veins, especially in people advanced in life, are of large size, and give rise, when divided, to troublesome hsmorrhao-e. Pelvic Fascia. The pelvic fascia (fig. 411) ia a thin membrane which lines the whole of the cavity ot the pelvis, and is continuous with the transversalis and iliac fascifB. It is attached to the brim of the pelvis for a short distance at the side of the cavity, and to the inner surface of the bone round the attachment of the Obturator internus.

The Levator ani muscle arises from the point of division of the pelvic fascia; the visceral layer of the fascia descending upon and being intimately adherent to the upper surface of the muscle, while the under surface of the muscle is covered by a thin layer derived from the obturator fascia, called the ischio-rectal or anal fascia. In the female, the vagina perforates tbe recto-vesical fascia, and receives a prolongation from it.IND EX.

344 ARTERIES. Tracliolo-mastoid muscles, and resting upon tlie Complexus, Superior oblique, and Rectus cajntis posticus major muscles ; it then ascends vertically upwards, piercing the cranial attachment df the Trapezius, and passes iu a tortuous course over the occiput, as high as the vortex, whore it divides into numerous branches. Tho. branches given oil" from this vessel are, Muscular. Meningeal. Auricular. Arteria Princeps Ccrvicis. Tho muscular hranches supply the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, Sterno-mastoid, Splenius, and Trachelo-raastoid muscles. Tho branch distributed to tho Stcrno- mastoid is of large size. The auricular branch supplies the back part of the concha. The meningeal branch ascends with the internal jugular vein, and enters the skull through the foramen lacerum posterius, to supply the dura mater in the posterior fossa. , . , , The arteria princeps cervicis (fig. 212) is a large branch which descends along the back part of the neck, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The former runs beneath the Splenius, giving off branches which perforate that muscle to supply the Trapezius, anastomosing with the Superficial cervical artery: the latter passes beneath the Complexus, between it and the SemispinaUs colli, and â–  anastomoses with the vertebral and deep cervical branch of the superior inter- costal. The anastomosis between these vessels serves mainly to establish the collateral circulation after ligature of the carotid or subclavian artery. The cranial branches of the occipital artery are distributed upon the occiput; they are very tortuous, and lie between the integument and Occipito-frontalis anastomosing with the artery of the opposite side, the posterior auricular, and temporal arteries. They supply the back part of the Occipito-frontalis muscle, the integument and pericranium, and one or two branches occasionally pass through the parietal or mastoid foramina, to supply the dura mater. The Posterior Auricular Artery (fig. 209) is a small vessel which arises trom the external carotid, above the Digastric and Stylo-byoid muscles, opposite the apex of the styloid process. It ascends, under cover of the parotid gland to the groove between the cartilage of the ear and the mastoid process, immediately above which it divides into two branches, an anterior, passing forwards to_ anastomose with the posterior division of the temporal; and a posterior, communicating with the occipital. Just before arriving at the mastoid process, this artery is crossed by the portio dura, and has beneath it the spinal accessory nerve. Besides several small branches to the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid muscles, and to the parotid gland, this vessel gives off two branches: Stylo-Mastoid. Auricular. The stylo-mastoid branch enters the stylo-mastoid foramen, and supplies the tym- panum, mastoid cells, and semicii'cular canals. In the young subject a branch from this vessel forms, with the tympanic branch from the internal maxdlary, a vascular ch-cle, which surrounds the auditory meatus, and from which delicate vessels ramify on the membrana tympani. .-i ^ flir. The auricular branch is distributed to ihe back part of the cartilage ot le ear upon which it ramifies minutely, some branches curving round the margin of the fibro-cartilage, others perforating it, to supply its anterior surface. The ASCENDING Pharyngeal Artery (fig. 2x2), the smallest branch o tlie ex- ternal carotid, is a long slender vessel, deeply seated in the ^^^^^,f ^^^^^^^ branches of tho external carotid and the Stylo-pharyngeus muscle.

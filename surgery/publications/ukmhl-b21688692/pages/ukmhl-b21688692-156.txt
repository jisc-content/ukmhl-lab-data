THPJ SKELETON. Tub Occipital Bonb. The Occipital Bone (fig. 22) is situated at the back part and base of the cranium, is trapezoid ia form, curved upon itself, and presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. e.r t „„„;i The Mdemal Surface is convex. Midway between the summit of tlie bone and the posterior margin of the foramen magnum is a prominent tubercle, the external occipital protuberance, for the attachment of the Ligamentum nucha.; and descend- ingfrom it as far as the foramen, a vertical ridge, the external occipital ciest. This tubercle and crest vary in prominence m difierent skulls, ihere is a sem,- circular ridge on each side, passing outwards from the occipital protuberance. Thee are the superior curved lines ; and running parallel Avith these from the middle of the crest are the two inferior curved lines. The surface of the bone above the .nnerior curved lines is smooth on each side, and, in the recent state, is covered by the Occipito-frontalis muscle, whilst the ridges, as well as the surface of the bone 22.—Occipital Bone, Outer Surface. between them, serve for the attachment of numerous mus l s^^ T^^^ curved line gi;es attachment internally to the Trape-us above^vhich neurosis of fhe occipito-frontaHs, externally to the muscul^- ongm of t P,^^_ frontalis and to the Sterno-cleido-mast.id, to the e-^/"\« capitis and Bions between the curved lines to the Complexus -ternally «ie Sp^en l^^^^.^^^ Obliquus capitis superior externally.

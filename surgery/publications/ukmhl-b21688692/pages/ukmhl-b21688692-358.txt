MUSCLES AND FASCIA. 222 It is a si,ron^ fibrous layer, which invests the muscles of the neck, and encloses tho vessels and norvcs. It commences, as an extremely thin layer, at the back part of the neck, where it is attached to the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrfe, and to the ligamcntnm nucha3; and, passing forwards to the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, divides into two layers, one of which passes in front, and tho other behind that muscle. These join again at the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid; and, being contimied forwards to the front of the neck blend with the fascia of the opposite side. The superhcial layer of the deep cervical fascia (that which passes in front of the Sterno-mastoid , if traced upwards is found to pass across the parotid gland and Masseter muscle, forming the parotid and masseteric fascia, and is attached to the lower border of the zygoma, and more anteriorly to the lower border of the body of the ja,w; if the same layer is traced downwards, it is seen to pass to the upper border of the clavicle and sternum, beino-pierced just above the former bone by the external jugular vein. In the middle line of the neck, the fascia is thin above, and connected to the hyoid bone; but it becomes thicker below, and divides, just below the thyroid gland, into two layers the more super6cial of which is attached to the upper border of the sternum and interclavicular ligaments; the deeper and stronger layer is connected to the posterior border of that bone, covering in the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles Between these two layers is a little areolar tissue and fat, and occasion- ally a small lymphatic gland. Tbe deep layer of the cervical fascia (that which lies behind the posterior surfac-e of the Sterno-mastoid) sends numerous pro- longations, which invest the muscles and vessels of the neck ; if traced upwards, a process of the fascia, of extreme density, is found passing behmd and to the inner side of the parotid gland, to be attached to the base of the styloid process and ano-le of the lower jaw, termed the stylo-maxillary ligament; if traced down- wards and outwards, the fascia will be found to enclose the postenor belly of the Omo-hyoid muscle, binding it down by a distinct process, which descends to be inserted into the clavicle and cartilage of the first rib. The deep layer of the cervical fascia also assists in forming the sheath which encloses the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve. There are fi^ro-s s^P^a interv;ning between each of these parts, which, however are included together S one common investment. More internally, a thin layer is continued across the trachea and thyroid gland, beneath the Sterno-thyroid muscles ; and ^tthe root of the neck this may be traced, over the large vessels, to be continuous with the ntel^::-t.S^^^^^^^^ (fi.- ^53) is a large^^^«\-to which passes obliquely across the side of the neck, being enclosed between he two Ws of he deep cervical fascia.

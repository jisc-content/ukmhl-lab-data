OF THE SPINE. the elbow aro flexed simultaneously, and simultaneously extended,' in consequenco •of the passage of the biceps and triceps cubiti over both joints. 2. It enables the short muscles which pass over only one joint to act upon more than one. ' Thus if the Eectus femoris remain touically of such length that when stretched over the extended hip, it compels extension of the knee, then the Gluteus maximus becomes not only an extensor of the hip, but an extensor of the knee as well.' 3. It pi-ovides the joints with ligaments which, while they are of very great power in resisting movements to an extent incompatible with the mechanism of the joint, at the same time spontaneously yield when necessary. ' Taxed beyond its strength a ligament will be ruptured, whereas a contracted muscle is easily relaxed; also, if neighbouring joints be united by ligaments, the amount of flexion or extension of each must remain in constant proportion to that of the other ; while, if the union •be by muscles, the sepai'ation of the points of attachment of those muscles may vary considerably in diiferent varieties of movement, the muscles adapting them- selves tonicaUy to the length required.' The quotations are from a very interest- .ing paper, by Dr. Cleland, in the ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' No. i. 1866, p. 85 ; by whom I believe this important fact in the mechanism of joints was first clearly pointed out, though it has been independently observed afterwards by other anatomists. The articulations may be arranged into those of the trunk, those of the upper I extremity, and those of the lower extremity. AETICULATIONS OF THE TRUNK. These may be divided into the following groups, viz.:— I. Of the vertebral column. VII. Of the cartilages of the ribs with II. Of the atlas with the axis. the sternum, and with each other, III. Of the atlas with the occipital bone. YHI. Of the sternum. rV. Of the axis with the occipital bone. IX. Of the vertebral column with the V. Of the lower jaw. pelvis. VI. Of the ribs with the vertebrae. X. Of the pelvis. I. Articulations of the Vebtebeal Column. The difi"erent segments of the spine are connected together by ligaments, which admit of the same arrangement as the vertebra. They may be divided into five sets._ I. Those connecting the hodies of the vertebrse. 2. Those connecting the lammce. 3. Those connecting the articular processes. 4. Those connecting the spmms processes. 5. T^hose of the transverse processes. The articulations of the hodies of the vertebrae with each other form a series of amphiarthrodial jomts: those between the articular processes form .a series of arthrodial jomts. I.

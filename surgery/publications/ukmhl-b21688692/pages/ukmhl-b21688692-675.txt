INTERCOSTAL. the fore-arm, in the substance of that muscle, and, emerging from its lower border, passes down between the superficial and deep layer of muscles, to the middle of the fore-arm. Considerably diminished in size, it descends on the interosseous membrane, beneath the Extensor secundi internodii poUicis, to the back of the carpus, where it presents a gangliform enlargement, from which filaments are dis- tributed to the ligaments and articulations of the carpus. It supplies all the muscles of the radial and posterior brachial regions, excepting the Anconeus, Supinator longus, and Extensor carpi radialis longior. Dorsal ITertes. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number on each side. The first appears between the first and second dorsal vertebrsB, and the last between the last dorsal and first lumbar. The roots of origin of the dorsal nerves are few in number, of small size, and vary but slightly from the second to the last. Both roots are very slender; the posterior roots only slightly exceeding the anterior in thickness. These roots gi-adually increase in length from above downwards, and remain in contact with the spinal cord for a distance equal to the height of, at least, two vertebras, in the lower part of the dorsal region. They then join in the intervertebral foramen, and, at their exit, divide into two branches, a posterior (dorsal), and an anterior, (intercostal) branch. The first and last dorsal nerves are peculiar in several respects (see next page). The posterior branches of the dorsal nerves, which are smaller than the intercostal, pass backwards between the transverse processes, and divide into external and internal branches. The external Iranches increase in size from above downwards. They pass through the Longissimus dorsi, corresponding to the celltilar interval between it and the Sacro-lumbalis, and supply those muscles, as well as their continuations upwards to the head, and the Levatores costarum; the five or six lower nerves also give ofi" cutaneous filaments. The internal Iranches of the six upper nerves pass inwards to the interval between the Multifidus spinse, and Semispinalis dorsi muscles, which they supply; and then, piercing the origin of the Rhomboidei and Trapezius, become cutaneous by the side of the spinous processes. The internal branches of the six lower nerves are distributed to the Multifidus spinas, without giving off any cutaneous filaments. ^ The cutcmeous branches of the dorsal nerves are twelve in number, the six upper being derived from the internal branches, and the six lower from the external branches. The former pierce the Rhomboid and Trapezius muscles, close to the spmous processes, and ramify in the integument. They are frequently furnished with gangliform enlargements. The six lower cutaneous branches pierce th& Serratus posticus inferior, and Latissinms dorsi, in a line with the angles of the ribs. ° Intercostal N'erves.

370 ARTERIES. its division into three portions: the first portion being that above the Pectorahs minor; the second portion, behind ; and the third, below that muscle. The first porlion of the axillary artery is in relation, in front, with the cla- vicular portion of the Peotoralis major, the costo-coracoid membrane, the Sub- clavius, and the cephalic vein ; hoMnd, with the first intercostal space, the corre- sponding Intercostal muscle, the iirst serration of the Serratus maguus, and the posterior thoracic nerve ; on its outer side with the brachial plexus, from which it is separated by a little cellular interval; on its mner, or thoracic side, with the axillary vein.

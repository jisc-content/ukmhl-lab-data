For a more detailed description of this body, we would refer to the elaborate account in ' Luschka's Anatomie,' and to the authorities quoted m Dr. Macahster s paper, as well as to a monograph by Dr. W. Mitchell Banks, reprinted m 1867 from the ' Glasgow Medical Journal.' Common Iltac Aetbeies. ' The abdominal aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries. The bifur- cation usually takes place on the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. This point corresponds to the left side of the umbilicus, and is on a level with a Une drawn from the highest point of one iliac crest to the other. The common iliac arteries are about two inches in length ; diverging fi-om the termi- nation of the aorta, they pass downwards and outwards to the margin of the pelvis, and divide opposite the intervertebral substance, between the last lunibar vertebra and the sacrum, into two branches, the external and internal iUac arteries: the former supplying the lower extremity; the latter, the viscera and parietes of the pelvis. The right covimon iliac is somewhat larger than the left, and passes more obliquely across the body of the last lumbar vertebra. In front of it are the peritoneum, the ileum, branches of the sympathetic nerve, and, at its point of division, the ureter. Behind, it is separated from the last lumbar vertebra by the two common iliac veins. On its outer side, it is in relation with the inferior vena cava, and right common iliac vein, above ; and the Psoas magnus muscle, below. The left common iliac is in relation, in front, with the peritoneum, branches of the sympathetic nerve, the rectum and superior haemorrhoidal artery ; and is crossed at its point of bifurcation by the nreter. The left common iliac vein lies partly on the inner side, and part beneath the artery ; on its outer side, the artery is in relation with the Psoas magnus. Branches. The common iUac arteries give off" small branches to the peritoneum. Psoas muscles, ureters, and the surrounding cellular membrane, and occasionally give origin to the ilio-lumbar, or renal arteries. • Virchow, Arch., 1864,5,6; see alaoKrause and Meyer in Heule and PfeifFer's Zeituch.f. rat. Medicin. t In a course of lectures recently delivered at the College of Surgeons on the Develop- ment of the Brain, Mr. Callender suggests that Luschka's gland may have the same relation to the development of the spinal cord as he proves the pineal and pituitary body to have to that of the brain.

248 MUSCLES AND FASCTJE. internal posterior branches of the sacral nerves. The Recti and Obliqui muscles are all supplied by the suboccipital and groat occipital nerves. Admi8. The Erector spinro, comprising the Sacro-lambalis, with its accessory muscles, the Longissimus dorsi and Spinalis dorsi, serves, as its name implies, to maintain the spine in the erect posture ; it also serves to bend the trunk backwards when it is required to counterbalance the influence of any weight at the front of the body as, for instance, when a heavy weight is suspended from the neck, or when tlic'ro is any great abdominal development, as in pregnancy or dropsy; the peculiar gait under such circumstances depends upon the spine being drawn back- wards by the counterbalancing action of the Erector Bpina3 muscles. The muscles which' form the continuation of the Erector spinca upwards steady the head and neck and fix them in the upright position. If the Sacro-lumbalis and Longissimus dorsi of one side act, they serve to draw down the chest and spine to the corre- SDondino- side The Cervicalis ascendens, taking its fixed point from the cervical vertebri^ elevates those ribs to which it is attached. The Multifidus spinas acts successively upon the different parts of the spine; thus, the sacrum fumishes a fixed point from which the fasciculi of this muscle act upon the lumbar region ; these then become the fixed points for the fascicuH moving the dorsal region, and so on throughout the entire length of the spine; it is by the successive contraction and relaxation of the separate fascicuH of this and other muscles, that the spmo preserves the erect posture without the fatigue that would necessarily have been produced, had this position been maintained by the action of a single muscle. The Multifidus spina3, besides preserving the erect position of the spme, serves to rotate it, so that the front of the trunk is turned to the side opposite to that from wliich the muscle acts, this muscle being assisted in its action by the Obhquus externus abdominis. The Complexi, the analogues of the Multifidus spin^ in the neck, draw the head directly backward; if one muscle acts, it draws the head to one side, and rotates it so that the face is turned to the opposite side. The Rectus capitis posticus minor and the Superior oblique draw the head backwards; and the latter, from the obliquity in the direction of its fibres, may turn the fa«e to the opposite side. The Rectus capitis posticus major and the Obliquus inferior rotate the atlas, and, with it, the cranium round the odontoid process, and turn the face to the same side. Muscles of the Abdomen.

284 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. opposite the interval botwoen the radius and ulna. 6. For the tendon of the Ex- tensor carpi ulnaris, grooving the back of the ulna. The synovial membranes lining these sheaths are usually very extensive, reaching from above the annular ligament, down upon the tendons almost to their insertion. The Llmar fascia, forms a common sheath which nivests the muscles of the hand. It consists of a central and two lateral portions. „W The central portion occupies the middle of the palm is triangular shape o great strength and thickness, and binds down the tendons m this Bitua ion It is farrow above, being attached to the lower margin of annular h^^^^^^ receives the expanded tendon of the Pa -a- lo^^^^^^ in! and expanded', Ld opposite the heads of the metacarn^^ divides into tour and expanaea if subdivides in^lHMr'''''' ^^^""^ S ti^^^^^^^ xnuscles, and are attachedTafTof the first phalanx, and to the glenoid ligament: by this arrangement, four arches are formed under which the flexor tendons pass. The intervals left in the fascia, between the four fibrous slips, transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the Lumbricales: At the points of division of the palmar fascia mto the slips above mentioned, numerous strong transverse fibres bind the separate processes together. The palmar fascia is intimately adherent to the integument by numerous fibrous bands, and gives origin by its inner margin to the Palmans brevis ; it covers J supericial palmar arch, the tendons of the flexor muscles, and the branches of the medtn and'^ulnar nerves ; and on each side it gives off a vertical Beptum, w^ch i continuous with the interosseous aponeurosis, and separates the lateral from the on the radial sidf, the muscles of the ball of the tWb ; -d, on the ulnar ^^^^^ the muscles of the little finger ; they are continuous with the dorsal fascia, and m the palm with the middle portion of the pahnar fascia.

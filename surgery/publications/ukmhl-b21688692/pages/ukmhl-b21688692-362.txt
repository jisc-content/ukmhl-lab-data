The Omo-hyoid muscles not only depress the hyoid bone, but carry it backwards, and to one or the other Sde Th Jare also tensors of the cervical fascia. The Thyro-hyoid may act as an elevator of the thyroid cartilage, when the hyoid bone ascends, drawmg upwards the thyroid cartilage behind the os hyoides.* • 3. Supea-Hyoid Region.

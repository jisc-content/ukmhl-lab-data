THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. Ixxxi Fig. XXXIV.—Terminations of Motor-Nerves, according to Beale. • i, Nerve-tuft on the sarcoleuima of a muscular fibre; chameleon. Nerve-fibres are seen passing out of as well as into the tuft. 2, Nerve-fibres distributed to elementary muscular fibre ; chameleon, X 3,000, and reduced half. This is a very simple form of ' nerve-tuft,' clearly external to the sarcolemnm. 3, The intimate structure of a very simple 'nerve-tuft' on a muscular fibre of the chameleon. It will be observed that the nerve-fibres are continuous through- out, and that the whole is on the surface of the sarcolemma, x 3,000. This ' nerve-tuft' is, as it were, but a compound network. THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. The Vascular System, exclusive of its central organ, the Heart, Is divided into four classes of vessels-the Arteries, Capillaries, Veins, and Lymphatics—the mmute structure of which we will now proceed briefly to describe, referring the reader to the body of the work for aU that is necessary m the details of their ordinary anatomy. Structure of Arteries.-The arteries are composed of three coats : internal serous or epithelial coat {tunica intima of Kolliker), middle ibrous ovczrcular coat, and external cellular coat, or tunica adventitia. ^ The two inner coats together are very easily separated from the external, as by the ordinary operation of tying a ligature on the artery. ti, .

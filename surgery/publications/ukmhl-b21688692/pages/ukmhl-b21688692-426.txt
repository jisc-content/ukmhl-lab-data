If the direction of the fracture is oblique from above, downwards, and forwards, the lower fragment is drawn upwards and backwards by the Brachialis aSticus and Biceps in front, and the Tnceps behind. This injury may be di^^o^f fj"^ dislocation, by the increased mobihty in fiac- ture, the existence of crepitus, and the fact of the deformity being remedied by, "j' sion, on the discontinuance of _ which it is reproduced.

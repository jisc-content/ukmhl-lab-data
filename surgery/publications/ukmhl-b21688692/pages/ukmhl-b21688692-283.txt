STRUCTUEE OF JOINTS. 147 the capsular or otlier ligaments enclosing the joint, and is reflected over the sui'faco of any tendons passing through its cavity, as the tendon of the Poplitcus in the knee, and the tendon of the Biceps in the slioulder. In most of the joints, the synovial membrane is thi'own into folds, which project into the cavity. Some of these folds contain lai'ge masses of fat. These are especially distinct in the hip and the knee. Others ai-e flattened folds, subdivided at their margins into fringe-like processes, the vessels of which have a convoluted arrangement. The latter generally project from the synovial membrane near the margin of the cartilage, and lie flat upon its surface. They consist of connective tissue, covered "with epithelium, and contain fat cells in variable quantity, and, more rarely, isolated cartilage cells. They are found in most of the bui-sal and vaginal, as ■weU as in the articular synovial membranes, and were described, by Clopton Havers, as mucilaginous glands, and as the source of the synovial secretion. Under certain diseased conditions, similar processes are found covering the entire surface of the synovial membrane, forming a mass of pedunculated fibro-fatty growths, which project into the joint. The Iwsce are found interposed between surfaces which move upon each other, producing friction, as in the gliding of a tendon, or of the integument over pro- jecting bony surfaces. They admit of subdivision into two kinds, the lursce mucosce, ^ and the stjnovial Uirsm. The former are large, simple, or irregular cavities in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, enclosing a clear viscid fluid. They are found in various situations, as between the integument and front of the patella, over the olecranon, the malleoh, and other prominent parts. The synovial hursce are found interposed between muscles or tendons as they play over projectino- bony surfaces, as between the Glutei muscles and surface of the great trochanter They consist of a thin wall of connective tissue, partially covered by epithelium" and contain a viscid fluid. Where one of these exists in the neighbourhood of a joint, it usually communicates with its cavity, as is generally the case with the bm-sa between the tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus and the capsular Hc^ament of the hip, or the one interposed between the under surface of the Subscapularis and the neck of the scapula. The vaginal synovial memhranes (synovial sheaths) serve to facilitate the ghdmg of tendons in the osseo-fibrous canals through which they pass The membrane is here arranged in the form of a sheath, one layer of which adheres to the wall of the canal, and the other is reflected upon the outer surface of the con- llll fl^'?,' *^!JP^°^ two free surfaces of the membrane being tClf/o? h r '^T'^- '^^"^^^ f^^^d surrounding th!

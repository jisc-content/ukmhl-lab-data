At each end of the ridges above- mentioned, are seen the anterior sacral foramina, analogous to the intervertebral foramina, four in number on each side, somewhat rounded in form, diminish- ing in size fi'om above downwards, and directed outwards and forwards ; they transmit the anterior branches of the sacral nerves. External to these fora- mina is the lateral mass, consisting, at an early period of life, of separate seg- ments, which correspond to the ante- rior transverse processes ; these become blended, in the adult, with the bodies, with each other, and with the posterior transverse processes. Each lateral mass is traversed by four broad shallow grooves, which lodge the anterior sacral nerves as they pass outwards, the grooves- being separated by prominent ridges of bone, which give attachment to the slips, of the Pyriformis muscle. ,If a vertical section is made through the centre of the bone (fig. 15), the- bodies are seen to be united at their- circumference by bone, a wide interval being left centrally, which, in the recent state, is filled by intervertebral sub- stance. In some bones, this union is- more complete between the lower seg- ments than between the upper ones. The Posterior Surface (fig. 16) is convex and much narrower than the anterior.- In the middle line are three or four tubercles, which represent the rudimentary spinous processes of the sacral vertebrae. Of these tubercles, the first is usually prominent, and perfectly distinct from the rest; the second and third are either- separate, or united into a tubercular ridge, which diminishes in size from above downwards; the fourth usually, and the fifth always, remaining undeveloped. External to the spinous processes on each side, are the lamina}, broad and well marked! in the first three pieces; sometimes the fourth, and generally the fifth, being un- developed ; in this situation the lower end of the sacral canal is exposed. External to the laminsB is a linear series of indistinct tubercles representing the articulan- processes ; the upper pair are large, well developed, and correspond in shape and direction to the superior articulating processes of a lumbar vertebra ; the second and third are small; the fourth and fifth (usually blended together) are situated.

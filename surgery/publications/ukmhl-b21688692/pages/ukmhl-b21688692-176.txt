THE SKELETON". 4° olfactory nerve, and perforated by foramina for the passage of its filaments. These foramina are arranged in three rows ; the innermost, which are the largest and least nnraerous, are lost in grooves on the upper part of the septum ; the foramina of the outer row are continued on to tho surface of the upper spongy bone, ihe foramina of the middle row are the smaUost; they perforate the bone, and transmit nerves to tho roof of the nose. At the front part of the cribriform plate, on each side of the crista galli, is a small fissure, which transmits the nasal branch ot the ophthalmic nerve; and at its posterior part a triangular notch, whicli receives the ethmoidal spine of the «i.hpiinirl •^q —Perpendicular Plate of Ethmoid (enlarged). Shown by sphenoid. 39- 1 re,novinK the Right Lateral Mass. The Ferpeuchcular >^ ° Plate (fig. 39) is a thin flattened lamella of bone, which descends from the under surface of the cribriform plate, and assists in forming the septum of the nose, it is much thinner in the middle than at the circumference, and is generally deflected a little to one side. Its anterior border aj-ti-cu- lates with the frontal spine and crest of the nasal bones. Its pos- terior divided into two •-, ^ ^ parts is connected by itc upper half wtth t%e rostrum of the sphenoid-by its lower half with the vomer. The inferior border serves for the attachment of the tn- ano-ular cartilage of the nose. On each side of the perpendicular plate numerous grooves and canals are seen, leading from foramina on the cribriform plate ; they lodge filaments of the olfactory nerves. n j „„ii„l«r The Lateral Masses of the ethmoid consist of a .number of thin-walled cellular cavities, the ethmoidal cells, interposed between two vertical plates of bone the outer one of which forms part of the orbit, and the Inner one part of the nasal fossa of the corresponding side. In the disarticulated bone many of these cells appear to be broken; but when the bones are articulated, they are closed m at every mrt.

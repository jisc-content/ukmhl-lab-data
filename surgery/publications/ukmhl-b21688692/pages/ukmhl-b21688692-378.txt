242 MUSCLES AND PASCIiE. The Splenins is situated at the back the neck and upper part of the dorsal region. At its origin, it is a single muscle, narrow and pointed in form; but it soon becomes broader, and divides into two pc.rtions, whiclvhave separate anscrtions. It arises, by tendinous fibres, h-om the lower halt o the hgamentum nachoe from the spinous processes of the last Cervical and of the 8.x upper dorsal vertebra, and from the supraspinous ligament. From this ongm, the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely upwaixis and outwards, forming a broad flat muscle which dmdes as it ascends into two portions, the Splenius capitis and Splenms colli The Svlenius GaniUs is inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and into the rouo-h surface on the occipital bone beneath the superior curved line. ' The 8plenms°0uUi is inserted, by tendinous fascicuh, into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three or four upper cervical vertebrae. ^ The Splenius is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by a tiiangular interval, in which is seen tlie Complexus. _ Belations By its superficial surface, with the Trapezms, from which it is senarated below by the Rhomboidei and the Serratus posticus superior^ It is covered at its insertion by the Sterno-mastoid. By its deep surface with the Spinalis dorsi, Longissimus dorsi, Semispinalis colli, Complexus, Trachelo-mastoid, and Transversalis colli. ,. -, ^ lx. t.^^„r,^ Nerves The Splenius and Superior serratus are supplied from the externa posterior branches of the cervical nerves ; the Inferior serratus from the external liT-inches of the dorsal nerves. . , • . u Actions The Serrati are respiratory muscles acting m antagomsm to_ each other The Serratus posticus superior elevates the ribs ; it is, therefore, an inspi- rator; muscle ; while the Serratus inferior draws the lower ribs downwards and L a Se of'expiration.

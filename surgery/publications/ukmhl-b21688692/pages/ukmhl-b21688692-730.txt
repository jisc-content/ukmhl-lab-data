The posterior lignmenl of the incus is a short, thick, ligamentous band, -which connects the extremity of tlio short process of the incus to the posterior wall of the tympanum, near the margin of the opening of the mastoid ceUs. The annular ligament of the stapes connects the circumference of the base of this bono to the margin of the fenestra ovalis. A suspensory Ihjannent of the incus has been described by Arnold, descending from the roof of the tympanum to tho upper part of the incus, near its articulation with the malleus. The muscles of the tympanum are three :— Tensor tympani. Laxator tympani. Stapedius. The Tensor tympani, the largest, is contained in the bony canal, above the osseous portion of the' Eustachian tube, from which it is separated by the processus cochleariformis. It arises from the under surface of the petrous bone, from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube, and from the osseous canal m which it is contained. Passing backwards, it terminates in a slender tendon which is reflected outwards over the processus cochleariformis, and is inserted into the handle of the malleus, near its root. It is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion. . „ The Laxator tympani major (Sommerring) arises from the spinous process ot the sphenoid bone, and from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube, and passing backwards through the Glaserian fissure, is inserted into the neck ot the malleus, just above the processus gracilis. It is supplied by the tympanic branch of the facial. j u i <- The Laxator tympani minor (Sommerring) arises from the upper and back part of the external meatus, passes forwards and inwards between the middle and inner layers of the membrana tympani, and is inserted into the handle ot the malleus, and processus brevis. The Laxator tympani major is now ^6-7 8^-^^^^ believed to Jligamentous and not muscular, and there seems httle doubt that the structure described under the name of Laxator tympam minor is a l^g^ent. The Stapedius arises from the sides of a conical cavity hollowed out of the interior of the pyramid: its tendon emerges from the orifice at the apex of the pyrlmid, and passing forwards, is inserted into the neck of the stapes. Its surfac fs'aponekroticfits interior fleshy; and its tendon ooc.sron.llj cont.^s.^e^^ bony spine, which is constant in some mammaha.

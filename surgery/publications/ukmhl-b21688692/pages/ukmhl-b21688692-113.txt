THE PLACENTA. cue The Placenta is tlie organ by which the connection between the foetus and mother is maintained, and through which blood reaches the fcetus and I is returned to the uterus. It therefore subserves the purposes both of circulation and respiration. It is formed of tAVO parts, as already shown- i viz. the maternal portion which is developed out of the decidua vera F\g.

(serotina), and the fcetal placenta formed by the villous chorion. Its shape in the human subject is that of a disc, one side of which adheres to the uterine walls, while the other is covered by the amnion. The villi of the chorion (or foetal placenta) gradually enlarge, forming large projections— ' cotyledons '—which each contain the ramifications of vessels communi- cating with the umbilical arteries and veins of the foetus. These vascular tufts are covered with epithelium, and project into corresponding depres- sions in the mucous membrane of the uterine walls. The maternal portion of the placenta consists of a large number of cells formed by an enlarge- ment of the vessels of the uterine wall, and conveying the uterine blood into close proximity to the villi of the foetal placenta, which dip into these cells. The interchange of fluids, necessary for the growth of the foetus, and for the depuration of the blood, takes place through the walls of these

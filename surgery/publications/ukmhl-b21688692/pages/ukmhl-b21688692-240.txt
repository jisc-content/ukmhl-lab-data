I04 THE SKELETON. Avitbin of cancellous tissue enclosed in a layer of compact bone. Eacb bone is also developed from a single centre of ossification. Bones of the Upper Row. (Figs. 94, 95.) The Scaphoid is tbe largest bone of the first row. It has received its name from its fancied resemblance to a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite. It is situated at the upper and outer part of the carpus, its direction being from above downwards, outwards, and forwards. The ewper^or surface is convex, smooth, of triangular shape, and articulates with the lower end of the radius The inferior surface, directed downwards, outwards, and backwards, is smooth, convex, also triangular, and divided by a shght ridge into two parts, the external of which articulates with the trapezium, the inner with the trapezoid. The posterior or dorsal surface presents a narrow, rough groove, which mns the entire breadth of the bone, and serves for the attachment of ligaments, ihe anterior or palmar surfa.ce is concave above, and elevated at its lower and outer Tjart into a prominent rounded tubercle, which projects forwards from the front of the carpus and gives attachment to the anterior annular hgament of the wrist The external surface is rough and narrow, and gives attachment to_ the external lateral li-ament of the wrist. The internal surface presents two articular tacets : of these °the superior or smaller one is flattened, of semilunar form, and articulates with the semilunar ; the inferior or larger is concave, forming with the semilunar bone, a concavity for the head of the OS magnum. _ Lav it with the dorsal surface, i.e., the narrow nonarticular grooved surface, on the table, and the convex radial articular surface towards you. The tubercle is outwards, i.e., points to the side to which the bone belongs.* ZLutioJ. With five bones : the radius above, trapezium and trapezoid below, OS mas-num and semilunar internally. The Semilunar bone may be distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline It is situated in the centre of the upper row of the cai-pus between the scaphoid and cuneiform. The superior surface, convex, smooth, and bounded by S edges, articulates with the radius. The inferior surface is deeply concave, and of greater extent from before backwards than transversely ; it ai'ticulates with he head of the os magnum, and by a long narrow facet (separated by a ndge from the Ineral surface) with the unciform bone. The anterior or palmar and posteuor or dZ!at surfaces ire rough, for the attachment of ligaments, the former being the Wder and of somewhat rounded form. The extemal surface presents a narrow, flattened semilunar facet, for articulation with the scaphoid.

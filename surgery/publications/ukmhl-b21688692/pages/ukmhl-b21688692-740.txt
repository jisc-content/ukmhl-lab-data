ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 6o4 oris, round the orifice of the mouth. They are rounded in form, about the size of small peas, their ducts opening by small orifices upon the mucous membrane. In structure, they resemble the other salivary glands. The CuiOEKS form the sides of the face, and are continuous in front with the lips. They are composed, externally, of integument; internally, of mucous mem- brane, and between the two, of a muscular stratum, besides a largo quantity of fat, areolar tissue, vessels, nerves, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheek is rcllccted above and below upon the gums, and is continuous behind with the lining membrane of the soft palate. Opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw is a papilla, the summit of 319.â€”Sectional View of the Nose, Mouth, Pharynx, etc. which presents the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The principal muscle of the cheek is the Buccinator ; but numerous other muscles enter into its formation ; viz., the Zygomatici, Masseter, and Platysma myoides. The buccal (jlands are placed between the mucous membrane and iiuccinatoi muscle: they are similar in structure to the labial glands, but smaller iwo or three, of larger size than the rest, are placed between the Masseter and Buccinator muscles ; their ducts open into the mouth, opposite the last molar tooth, i ney are called molar glands. , , , .1 The Gums are composed of a dense fibrous tissue, closely connected to ti>. periostoum of the alveolar processes, and smi-ounding the necks of the teetb 1 3 are covered by smooth and vascular mucous membrane, which is remarkable tor

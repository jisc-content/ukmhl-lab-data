Those joints are therefore to be regarded as accessoiy structures to the shoulder-joint * The extent of these^movements of the seapula is very considerable, especially in extreme elevation of the arm which movement is ,1 T 1 I ^lion tlio arm is thrown somewhat forward, since the articular best accomplislied wnen I'no nil" .-.n ,n j -.i i • n % f Immerus is broader in the middle than at either end, especially the surlace ol tlie im elevation directly forward is less, and that directly bSard tin more xlstricted. The great width of the central portion of the uauK^a allows of very free horizontal movement when the arm is ™ d to a ri°'ht angle, in which movement the arch formed by the acromion, the comcoid process, and the coraco-acromial ligament, constitutes a sort of supple- mental articular cavity for the head of the bone. Mwii I . -1 The looseness of the capsule is so great that the arm will fall about an inch from the scapula when the muscles are dissected from the capsular ligament, and an opening made in it to remove the atmospheric pressure. The movements of the joint, therefore, are not regulated by the capsule, so much as by the surrounding muscles and by the pressure of the atmosphere, an arrangement which renders the movements of the joint much more easy than they would otherwise haVe been, and permits a swinging pendulum-like vibration of the limb, when the muscles are at rest' (Humphry.) The fact, also, that in all ordinary positions of the joint the capsule is not put on the stretch, enables the aim to move freely in all direclnons. Extreme movements are checked by the tension of appropriate portions of the capsule, as well as by the interlocking of the bones. Thus is said that abduc- tion is checked by the contact of the great tuberosity with the upper edge of the glenoid cavity, adduction by the tension of the coraco-humeral ligament. (Beaunis ^TTelntimlte union of the tendons of the four short muscles with the capsule converts these muscles into elastic and spontaneously-acting ligaments of the joint and it is regarded as being also intended to prevent the folds into which all portions :rthe caplle would alternately fall in the varying positions of the joint from being driven between the bones by the pressure of the atmosphere. The plculiar relations of the biceps tendon to the shoulder^oint appear to sub serve various purposes. In the first place by its connection with both the shoulde and elbow, the muscle harmonises the action of the two J-nts, and acts as an Xasttc hgament in all positions, in the manner previously adverted to t Nex^ t s r ng^^^^^ -^ticular cavity, and prevents the ^^ead of the humerus from being pressed up against the acromion process when the deltoid humerus trom o =1 ^ ^^^-^^ the glenoid cavity.

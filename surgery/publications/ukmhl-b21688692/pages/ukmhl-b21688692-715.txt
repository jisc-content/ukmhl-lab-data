THE RETINA. 579 forwards; and, in front, extends nearly as far forwards as the ciliary ligament, where it terminates by a jagged margin, the ora serrata. It is soft, and semi- transparent, in the fresh state; but soon becomes clouded, opaque, and of a pinkish tint. Exactly in the centre of the posterior part of the retina, and at a point con-esponding to the axis of the eye, in which the sense of vision is most perfect, is a round, elevated, yellowish spot, called, after its discoverer, the yellow spot or limhus luteus, of Sommerriug; having a central depression at its summit, the fovea centralis. The retina in the situation of the fovea centrahs is exceedingly thin; so much so, that the dark colour of the choroid is distinctly seen through it; so that it presents more the appearance of a foramen, and hence the name ' foramen of Sommerring' at fii-st given to it. It exists only in man, the quadrumana, and some saurian reptiles. Its use is unknown. About y^th of an inch to the inner side of the yellow spot, is the point of entrance of the optic nerve ; the arteria centralis retinoe piercing its centre. This is the only part of the surface of the retina from which the power of ^dsion is absent. 305.—The Arteria Ceatralis Eetinae, Yellow Spot, etc., the anterior Half of the Eyeball being removed. (Enlarged.) Sclerotlo Choroid Set£n» Structure. The retina is composed of three layers, together with blood-vessels '. External or columnar layer (Jacob's membrane). Middle or granular layer. Internal or nervous layer. The blood-vessels do not form a distinct layer; they ramify in the substance of tne internal layer. The external, ov JacoVs membrane, is exceedingly thin, and can be detached from the external surface of the retina by the handle of the scalpel, in the form of a flocculent film. It is thicker behind than in front, and consists of rod-like bodies of two kinds: i. Columnar rods, solid, nearly of uniform size, and arranged peirendicularly to the surface. 2. Bulbous particles, or cones, which are interspersed at regular intervals among the former; these are conical or flask-shaped! their LrntdTotrl «f/r' t^e granular layer, the nan-ow pointed extrem'Jty'bei^g turned towards the choroid; they are not solid, like the columnar rods, but consist of an external membrane with fluid contpnts Rrr^ j i ' joined to the fibres of Miiller. ^ ^'^^ ^"^^^ ^'^^ the^L'f It ^^^-^^^^^-^ «f entire thickness of iat?d1rmeall:rV-^ P-f les, sopa- lated, and contains uo bloTd fes 1 1^^^^^^^^^ is transparent finely tibril- noTiRHfnor^f ^ ri "^"""/esseis. ihe outermost lamina is the thicker, and its constituent particles are globular.

From the arches formed by their inosculation, branches are distributed to the transverse colon. The branches of this vessel lie between two layers ot peritoneum. 225.—The Superior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. Inferior Mesenteric Artery, (Fig. 226.) In order to expose this vessel, draw the small intestines and mesentery over to the right side of the abdomen, raise the transverse colon towards the thorax, and divide the peritoneum covering the left side of the aorta. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery supplies the descending and sigmoid flexure •of the colon, and the greater part of the rectum. It is smaller than the superior ^nesenteric; and arises from the left side of the aorta, between one and two inches above its division into the common iliacs. It passes downwards to the left iliao fossa, and then descends, between the layers of the meso-rectum, into the pelvis,

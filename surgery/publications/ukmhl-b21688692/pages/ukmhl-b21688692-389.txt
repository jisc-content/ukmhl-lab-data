OF THK ABDOMEN. 253 The Transversalis muscle C6g. 165), so called from the ^^'.'^'^^^l'?^^^^ the most internal flat muscle of the abdomen, bemg placed immediately W^^^^^ the Internal oblique. It arises by fleshy fibres from the outer third of 1 "^P^ ^ s ligament, from the inner lip of the crest of the_ ihum, ^^.^^^,.^^.7;:^^^^^^ from the inner surface of the cartilages of the six lower ribs, mterdigitatrng with the Diaphragm, and by a broad aponeurosis from the spinous and transvex-se pro. cesses of the lumbar vertebrae. The lower fibres curve downwards, and are inserted, together with those of the internal oblique, into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, forming what was described above as the conjoined tendon ot •these muscles. Throughout the rest of its extent the fibres pass horizontaUy inwards, and near the outer margin of the Rectus, terminate m an aponeurosis, which is inserted into the linea alba ; its upper three-fourths passing behind the Rectus muscle, blending with the posterior lamella of the Internal obhque; its lower fourth passing in front of the Rectus. _ ^ Belatimis. By its external surface, with the Internal oblique, the inner surxace of the lower ribs, and Internal intercostal muscles. Its inner surface is liji^d by the fascia transversalis, which separates it from the peritoneum. Its low^er border forms the upper boundary of the spermatic canal. Lumbar Fascia (fig. 166). The vertebral aponeurosis of the Transversahs divides into three layers : an anterior, very thin, which is attached to the front part of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrts, and, above, to the lower margin of the last rib, where ifc forms the ligamentum arcuatum externum : a middle layer^ much stronger, which is attached to the apices of the transverse processes; and a posterior layer, attached to the apices of the spinous processes. Between the 166.—A Transverse Section of the Abdomen in the Lumbar Region, anterior and middle layers is situated the Quadratus lumborum; between the middle and posterior, the Erector Spinse. The posterior lamella of this aponeurosis receives the attachment of the Internal oblique; it is also blended with the apo- neurosis of the Serratus posticus inferior and with that of the Latissitnus dorsi, forming the lumbar fascia. Dissection. To expose the Eectus muscle, open its sheath by a vertical incision extehding from the margin of the thorax to the pubes, and then reflect the two portions from the surface of the muscle, which is easily done, excepting at the linese transversa, where so close an adhesion exists, that the greatest care is requisite in separating thorn. Now raise the outer edge of the muscle, in order to examine the posterior layer of the sheath. By dividing the muscle m the centre, and turning its lower part downwards, the point where the posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin will be seen. The Beclus Abdominis is a long flat muscle, which extends along the whole length of the front of the abdomen, being separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the linea alba. It is much broader above than below, and arises by two

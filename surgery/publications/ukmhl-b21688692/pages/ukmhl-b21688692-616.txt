48o NERVOUS SYSTEM. middle cerebral artery. At its commencement is Heen a point of medullary sub- stance, corresponding to a subjacent band of wbite fibres, connecting the anterior and middle lobes, and called the fasciculus unaifurmis ; on following this fissure outwards, it divides into two brandies, which enclose a triangular-shaped promi- nent cluster of isolated convolutions, the island of Bell. These convolutions, from being covered in by the sides of the fissure, are called the gyri uperti. The anterior perforated s^gace is situated at the inner side of the fissure of Slvvius It is of a triangular shape, bounded in front by the convolution of the anterior lobe and the roots of the olfactory nerve ; behind, by the optic tract; externallv by the middle lobe and commencement of the fissure of blyvms; internally it is continuous with the lamina cinerea, and crossed by the peduncle of the corpus callosum. It is of a greyish colour, and corresponds to the under surface of the corpus striatum, a large mass of grey matter, situated in the interior of the brain ; it has received its name from being perforated by numerous minute apertures for the transmission of small straight vessels into the substance of the ^'^^V op/^tTomm«e is situated in the middle line, immediately behind the Inmina cinerea. It is the point of junction between the two optic nerves. mmTd^ ely behind the diverging optic tracts, and between them and the ' pedu^des of tbe cerebrum (cr».ra ccrehri), is a lozenge-shaped interval, the

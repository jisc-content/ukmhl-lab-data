From these points, fleshy fibres succeed, which end in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the side a'nd under surface of the crus penis. This muscle compresses the crus penis, and thas serves to maintain the organ erect. The Transversus Perincei is a narrow muscular slip, which passes more or less transversely across the back part of the periuEeal space. It arises by a small tendon from the inner and fore side of the tuberosity of the ischium, and, passing obliquely forwards and inwards, is inserted into the central tendinous point of the perinseum, joining in this situation with the muscle of the opposite side, the Sphincter ani behind, and the Accelerator urines in front. Between the muscles just examined, a triangular space exists, bounded internally by the Accelerator urinte, externally by the Erector penis, and behind by the Transversus pei-insei. The floor of this space is formed by the triangular ligament of the urethra (deep perinaaal fascia), and, running from behind forwards in it, are the superficial perineaal vessels and nerves, the transverse perinaaal artery coursing along the posterior boundary of the space, on the Transversus perincei muscle. In the lateral operation of lithotomy, the knife is carried obliquely across the back part of this space, downwards and outwards, into the ischio-rectal fossa, dividing the Transversus pcrinasi muscle and artery, the posterior fibres of tho Accelerator urina), the superficial perina)al vessels and nerve, and more posteriorly the external hoemorrhoidal vessels.

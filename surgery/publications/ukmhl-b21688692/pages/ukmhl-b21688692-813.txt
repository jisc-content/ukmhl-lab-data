The muscular fibres are of the unstriped ^^"^The Elastic Fihres are situated beneath the mucous membrane, enclosing the entire cylinder of the trachea ; they are most abundant at its posterior part, where they are connected into longitudinal bundles. x j The Mucous Memlrane lining the tube is covered with columnar ciliated epi- thelium. It is continuous above with that of the larynx, and below with that ot the lungs. i. p The Tracheal Glands are found in great abundance at the posterior part ot the trachea. They are small, flattened, ovoid bodies, placed between the fibrous and muscular coats, each fiirnished with an excretory duct, which opens on the surface of the mucous membrane. Some glands of smaller size are also found at the sides of the trachea, between the layers of fibrous tissue connecting the rings, and others immediately beneath the mucous coat. The secretion from these glands serves to lubricate the inner surface of the trachea. Vessels and Nerves. The trachea is supplied with blood by the inferior thyroid arteries. The veins terminate in the thyroid venous plexus. The nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and its recurrent branches, and from the sym- pathetic. Stirgical Anatomy. The air-passage may he opened in three different situations: through the crico-thyroid memhrane {laryngotomy), through the cricoid cartilage, and upper ring of the trachea (laryngo-tracheotomy), or through the trachea below the isthmus of the thyroid gland {tracheotomy). The student should, therefore, carefully consider the relative anatomy of the air-tube in each of these situations. Beneath the integument of the laryngo-tracheal region, on either side of the median line, are the two anterior jugular veins. Their size and position vary ; there is nearly always one, and frequently two: at the lower part of the neck they diverge, passing beneath the Sterno- mastoid muscles, and are frequently connected by a transverse communicating branch. These veins should, if possible, always be avoided in any operation on the larynx or trachea. If cut through, considerable hfemorrhage occurs. Beneath the cervical fascia are the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the conti- guous edges of the former being near the median line; and beneath these muscles the following parts are met with, from above downwards: the thyroid cartilage, the crico- thyroid membrane, the cricoid cartilage, the trachea, and the isthmus ot the thyroid gland. The crico-thyroid space is very superficial, and may be easily felt beneath the skin as a depression, about an inch below the pomum Adanii; it is crossed transversely by a small artery, the crico-thyroid, the division of which is seldom accompanied by any troublesome hEemorrhage. The isthmus of the thyroid gland usually crosses the second and third rings of the trachea; above it is found a large transverse communicating branch between the superior thyroid veins, and the isthmus is covered by a venous*plexus, formed between the thyroid veins of opposite sides. On the sides of the thyroid gland, and below it, the veins converge to a single median vessel, or to two trunks which descend along the median line of the front of

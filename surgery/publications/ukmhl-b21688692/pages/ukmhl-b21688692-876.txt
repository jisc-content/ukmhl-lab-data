740 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. If traced downwards, it is found continuous with anotlier curved margin, tlie concavity of wliicli is directed npwards and inwards ; this is the inferior conm of the saphenous opening, and is blended witli the pubic portion of the fascia lata covering the Pectineus muscle. The inner houndarij of tlio opening is on a plane posterior to the out«r margin and behind the level of the femoral vessels ; it is much less promment and dehned than the outer, from being stretched over the subjacent Pectineus muscle. It is |, through the saphenous opening that a femoral hernia passes after descending along the crural canal. , ., j, v -u • a If the linger is introduced into the saphenous opening while the limb is movea , in different directions, the aperture will be found to be greatly constricted on extending the limb, or rotating it outwards, and to be relaxed on flexmg the limb and inverting it: hence the necessity of placing the limb in the latter position in employing the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia. The iliac portion of the fascia lata, together with its falciform process, should now be removed, by detaching it from the lower margin of Poupart s ligament carefully dissecting it from the'subjacout structures, and turning it aside when the sheath of the femoral ^e8Scl8 is exposed descending beneath Poupart's ligament (fig. 402). 402.-Femoral Hernia.

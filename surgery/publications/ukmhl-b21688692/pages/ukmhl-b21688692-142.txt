The body is of a triangular form; deeper ill front than behind, and prolonged downwards anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and foro part of the adjacent vertebra. It presents in front a median longitudinal ridge, separating two lateral depressions for the f^^^'^^'^l^^JZ Longus eolli museles of each side. The odontoul process presents two arliculaUng, surffces; one in front of an oval form, for articulat.on with the at '^s; anothe behind, for the transverse ligament; the latter frequently encroachmg on the sides of the process ; the apex is pointed Below the apex the Woooss^s^^.- what enlarged, and presents on either side a rough impress.on for ^''^"^^ of the odontoid or check ligaments, which connect it to t^ie occipital bone, the base of the process, where it is attached to the body is constncted, so as to prevent dispkcement from the transverse hgament, which bmds it m this situation to the anterior arch of the atlas.

Seventh Cervical (fig. 4)- The most distinctive character of this vertebra is the existence of a very long and prominent spinous pro- cess; hence the name 'Yertebra prominens.' This process is^thipk, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, and has attached to it the ligamentum nuchee. The trans- verse process is usually of large size, especially its posterior root; its upper surface has usually a shallow groove, and it seldom pre- sents more than a trace of bifurca- tion at its extremity. The vertebral foramen is sometimes as large as in the other cervical vertebr{B, usually smaller, on one or both sides, and sometimes wanting. On. the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on 4.—7th Cervical Vertebra, or Vertebra Prominens.

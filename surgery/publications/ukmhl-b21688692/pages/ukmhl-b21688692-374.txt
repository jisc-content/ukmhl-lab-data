238 MUSCLES AND FASUlyE. aponeurosis, wliich occupies the space bcbween the sixth cervical and the third dorsal vertebroD, and forms, with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle, a ten- dinous ellipse. The rest of the muscle arises by numerous short tendmous fibres. If the Trapezius is dissected on both sides, the two muscles resenible a trapezium, or diamond-shaped quadrangle; tWo angles corresponding to the shoulders; a third to the occipital protuberance ; and the fourth to the spinous process of the last dorsal vertebriB. , , i? -i. ii. 1 The clavicular insertion of this muscle varies as to the extent of its attach- tnent- it sometimes advances as far as the middle of the clavicle, and may even become blended with the posterior edge of the Sterno-mastoid, or overlap it. This should be borne in mind in the operation for tying the third part ot the subclavian artery. _ i • -l •. • 1 1 Belations By its superficial storface, with the integument, to which it is closely adherent above, but separated below by an aponeurotic lamina. By its deep sur- face in the neck, with the Complexus, Splenius, Levator angub scapula, and Bho'mboideus minor; in the back, with the Rhomboideus major, Supraspmatus Infraspinatus, a small portion of the Serratus posticus superior, the vertebral aponeurosis (which separates it from the Erector spinsB) and the Latissimus dorsi. The spinal accessory nerve passes beneath the anterior border of this muscle, near the clavicle. The anterior margin of its cervical portion forms the posterior boundary of the posterior triangle of the neck, the other boundaries being the Stemo-mastoid in front, and the clavicle below. -, n 1 £u The Ligamentum Nucha, (fig. 160) is a thin band of condensed cellulo-fibrous membrane, placed in the line of union between the two Trapezu m the neck it extends from the external occipital protuberance to the spinous process ot the seventh cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the supraspinous bgament From its anterior surface a fibrous slip is given off to the spinous process of each of the cervical vertebra, excepting the atlas, so as to form a septum between the muscles on each side of the neck. Li man, it is merely the rudiment of an im- portant elastic ligament, which, in some of the lower aUimals, serves to sustam the ""Itl"; l^orsi is a broad, flat muscle, which covers the lumbar and the lower half of the dorsal regions, and is gradually contracted into ^ narrow fasc cXb at its insertion into the humerus.

For the eonvenience of description of the viscera, as well as o reference to til morbid condition of the contained parts, the abdomen .s art.hcuaiy dmded into nine re-ions. Thus, if two circular lines are drawn round the body, the one pt aUd with the cartilages of the ninth ribs, and the other w;th the l^^g^est pomt of the crests of the ilia, the abdominal cavity is divided into three zones an upper, a middle, and a lower. If two parallel lines are drawn from the cartdage ol the eighth rib on each side, down to the centre of Poupart's hgament, each of these zones is subdivided into" three parts, a middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone is called the epigastric {eiri, over ; yaffr»/p, the stomach) ; and the two lateral regions, the right and left hypochondriac (hiro, under; x""Sp"', ^'^e cartilages). The central region of the middle zone is the urn- Ulical; and the two lateral regions, the right and left lumbar. The middle region of the lower zone is the hypogastric or puUc region ; and the lateral regions are the right and left inguinal. The viscera contained in these different regions are the following (fig. 331) =— Bight Hypochondriac. Epigastric Region. Left Hypochondriac.

The Peritoneum. The Peritoneum {ittpinlvtLy, to extend around) is a serous membrane ; and, like ^ all membranes of this class, a shut sac. In the female, however, it is not com- pletely closed, the Fallopian tubes communicating with it by their free extremities ; and thus the serous membrane is continuous with their mucous lining. The peritoneum partially invests all the viscera contained in the abdominal and polvio cavities, forming the visceral layer of the membrane; it is then reflected

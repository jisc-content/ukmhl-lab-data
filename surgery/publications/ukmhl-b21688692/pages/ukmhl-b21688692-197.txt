VERTEX AND BASE OE THE SKULL. 6r The sutures remain separate for a cousiclerable period after the complete forma- tion of the skull. It is probable that they serve the purpose of perm, tmg the growth of the bones at their margins; while tbeir pecuhar formation together w.th the interposition of the sutural ligament between the bones forming them, prevents the dispersion of blows or jars received upon the sku 1. Bj. Humphry remarks, ' that, as a general rale, the'sutures are first obliterated at the parts m wh.ch the ossiaktion of the skull was last completed, viz. m the neighbourhood of the fontanelles; and the cranial bones seem in this respect to observe a similar law to that which regulates the union of the epiphyses to the shafts of the Jong bones. THE SKULL. The Skull, formed by the union of the several cranial and facial bones already described, when considered as a whole, is divisible into five regions : a superior region or vertex, an inferior region or base, two lateral regions, and an anterior region, the face. Veetkx op the Skull. The Superior Region, or Vertex, presents two surfaces, an external and an internal. The External Surface is bounded, in front, by the nasal eminences and super- ciliary ridges ; behind, by the occipital protuberance and superior curved lines of the occipital bone ; laterally, by an imaginary line extending from the outer end of the superior curved line, along the temporal ridge, to the external angular process of the frontal. This surface includes the vertical portion of the frontal, the greater part of the parietal, and the superior third of the occipital bone ; it is smooth, convex, of an elongated oval form, crossed transversely by the coronal suture, and from before backwards by the sagittal, which terminates behind in the lambdoid. From before backwards may be seen the frontal eminences and remains of the sutnre connecting the two lateral halves of the frontal bone; on each side of the sagittal suture is the parietal foramen and parietal eminence, and still more posteriorly the smooth convex surface of the occipital bone. The Internal Surface is concave, presents eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the cerebrum, and numerous farrows for the lodgment of branches of the meningeal arteries. Along the middle line of this sui'face is a longitudinal groove, narrow in front, where it terminates in the frontal'crest; broader behind; it lodges the superior longitudinal sinus, and its margins afibrd attachment to the falx cerebri. On either side of it are several depressions for the Pacchionian bodies, and at its back part, the internal openings of the parietal foramina. This surface is crossed, in front, by the coronal suture ; from before backwards, by the sagittal; behind, by the lambdoid. Basis op the Skitll. The Inferior Region, or Base of the Skull, presents two surfaces, an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar. The Internal or Cerebral Surface (fig. 62), presents three fossae, on each side, called the anterior, middle, and posterior fossee of the cranium. The Anterior Fossa is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, the ethmoidal spine and lesser wing of the sphenoid. It is the most elevated of the three fossa), convex externally where it corresponds to the roof of the orbit, concave in the median line in the situation of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. It is traversed by three sutures, the ethmoido-frontal, ethmo- sphenoidal, and fronto-sphenoidal; and lodges the anterior lobe of the cerebrnm. it presents, in the median line, from before backwards, the commencement of the groove for the superior longitudinal sinus, and the crest for the attachment of the falx

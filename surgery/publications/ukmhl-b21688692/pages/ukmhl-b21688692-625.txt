The cavity of the third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, named, from their position, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior commissure is a rounded cord of white fibres, placed in front of the anterior crura of the fornix. It perforates the corpus striatum on either side, and spreads out into the substance of the hemispheres, over the roof of the descending horn of each lateral ventricle. The middle or soft commissure consists almost entirely of grey matter. It connects together the thalami optici, and is continuous with the grey matter lining the anterior part of the third ventricle. It is frequently broken in examining the brain, and might then be supposed to have been wanting. <

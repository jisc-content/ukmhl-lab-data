737 FEMORAL HERNIA. The internal saphenous vein is a vessel of considerable size which ascends obliquely upwards along the inner side of the thigh, below Poupart's ligament. It passes through the saphenous opening in the fescia lata to terminate in the femoral vein. This vessel is accompanied by numerous lymphatics, which return the lymph from the dorsum of the foot and inner side of the leg and thigh : they ter- minate in the inguinal glands, which surround the saphenous opening. Diverging from the same point are the superficial epigastric vessels, which mn across Poupart's hgament, obliquely upwards and inwards, to the lower part of the abdomen; the superficial circumflexa ilii vessels, which pass obliquely outwards 400.—Femoral Tlcinin.

These vessels supply the subcutaneous areolar tissue and the integument, and are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels, whicb return the lymph from the same parts to the inguinal glands. The superficial inguinal glands are an-anged in two groups, one of which is disposed above and parallel with Poupart's ligament, and the other below the ligament, surrounding the termination of the saphenous vein, and followino- (occasionally) the course of that vessel a short distance along the thigh. The upper chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the penis, scrotum, lowe°r part of the abdomen, pennoaum, and buttock; the lower chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. _ The nerves supplying the integument of this region are derived from the ilio- ingumal, the genito-crural, and anterior crural. The ilio-inguinal nerve may be 3 B

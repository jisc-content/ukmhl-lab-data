It is of a triaiignlar form, arising, hy its broad base, from the wholo length of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger on its palmar surface; the fibres proceeding outwards, converge, to be mserted with the mner tendon of trFlexor brevis^polhcis, into the ulnar side of tho base of the first phalanx of the thumb and into the internal sesamoid bone. „. • -i, . j 7da7on By its superficial surface, with tho Flexor brevis polhcis, the tendons of tt Cor profundus and the Lumbricales.

This segment of tho hand is provided with three Extensors an Extensor of the metacarpal bone, an Extensor of the first, and an Extensor of the second phalanx; these occupy the dorsal surface of the forearm and hand ?herere also, thr e flexors on the palmar surface, a Flexor of the metacarpal bone ^Flexor ossis metacarpi (Opponens Micis) the J^^^ll^^^^^^^^ and tho Flexor longus pollicis ; there is also an Abductor and an Adductor.

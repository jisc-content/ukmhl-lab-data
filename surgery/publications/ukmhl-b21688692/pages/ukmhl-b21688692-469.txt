In front, it is separated from the first bono of the sternum by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the remains of tho thymus gland, and the left innominate and right inferior thyroid veins which cross its root. BeJnnd, it lies upon the trachea, which it crosses obliquely. On the right side, is the right vena innominata, right pneumogastric nerve, and the pleura ; and on the left side, the remains of the thymus gland, and origin of the left carotid artery.

When the bifurcation of the innominate artery varies from the point above mentioned, it sometimes ascends a considerable distance above the sternal end of the clavicle; les.s frequently it divides below it. In the former class of cases, its length may exceed two inches; and, in the latter, be reduced to au inch or less. These are points of considerable interest for the surgeon to remember in connection with the opera- tion of tying this vessel. Branches. The arteria innominatfi occasionally supplies a thyroid branch (middle thyroid artery), which ascends along the front of the trachea to the thyroid gland ; and sometimes, a thymic pr bronchial branch. The left carotid is frequently joined with the innominate artery at its origin. Sometimes, there is no innominate artery, the right subclavian arising directly from the arch of the aorta. ^ Positio^i. When the aorta arches over to the right side, the innominate is directed to the left side of the neck instead of the right. Collateral circidation. Allan Burns demonstrated, on the dead subject, the possibility of the establishment of the collateral circulation after ligature of the innominate artery, by tying and dividing that artery, after which, he says, ' Even coarse injection impelled into the aorta, passed freely by the anastomosing branches into the arteries of the rio-ht arm, tilling them and all the vessels of the head completely.' (Surc/ical Anatomy of the Head and Neck, p. 62). Ihe branches by which this circulation vrould be carried on are very numerous; thus, all the communications across the middle line between the branches of the carotid arteries of opposite sides would be available for the supply of blood to the right side of the head and neck; while the anastomosis between the superior intercostal of the subclavian and the farst aortic intercostal (see infra on the collateral circulation after obliteration of the thoracic aorta), would bring the blood, by a free and direct course, into the right subclavian: the numerous connections also, between the lower intercostal arteries, and the branches ot the axillary and internal mammary arteries would, doubtless, assist in the supply of blood l^nl'^^S fr-T 1 epigastric, from the external iliac, would by means ot" its anasto- 3 of the chest "i™^7, compensate for any deficiency in the vascularity of the Surpical Anatomj/.

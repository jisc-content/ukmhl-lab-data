The Interposed Fihro-Oartilage consists of two oval-shaped plates, one covering the surface of each symphysis pubis. They vary m thickness in different subjects, and project somewhat beyond the level of the bones, especially behind The outer surface of each plate is firmly connected to the bone by a series of nipple-like processes, which accurately fit within coi-responding depres- sions on the osseous surface. Their opposed surfaces are connected in the greater pai-t of their extent, by an intermediate elastic fibrous tissue; and by their circumference to the various ligaments surrounding the joint. An interspace is left between tlie plates at the upper and back part of the articulation, where the fibrous tissue is deficient, and the surface of the fibro-cartilage is lined by epithelium THs space is found at all periods of life, both in the male and female • but it is larger in the latter, especially during pregnancy, and aftor partui-ition. It is most frequently limited to the upper and back part of the joint; 129.—Vertical Section of the Symphysis Pubis.

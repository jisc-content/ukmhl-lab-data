Ivi GENERAL ANATOMY. clear cells (tlie 'osteoblasts' of some anatomists), with granular contents, also arranged in somewhat parallel rows, each row and each pair of super- imposed cells being separated by a transparent cartilaginous matrix—the arrangement being compared by Rollett to a ladder. In the lower part of this region the matrix is encroached upon by calcareous matter, so that if a transverse section be made here, rings of dark granular calcareous deposit are seen enclosing the large round cells. As the section is taken deeper and deeper into the ossifying part, the calcified rings or Fig. XVII.—Longitudinal section through the ossifying portion of a long bone in the human embryo, a, Cartilnginous region, b, Eegion of the round clear cells, ff, Region of the dark gi-anular masses. •areolee are seen to enclose numerous smaller granular masses (' primitive marrow' of some authors) which have replaced the single clear cells, and may be formed by the proliferation of those cells. This, however, is doubted by Eollett and obhers, who believe that these masses are furnished by the underlying periosteal vessels. In the longitudinal section these masses are seen (at g) to succeed very suddenly to the separate clear cells. If they are detached from the surface, they are found to have one or more processes. Deeper down in the ossifying, or ossified portion, blood-vessels are met with, which proceed from the periosteum. The next step in the process is that the above-described areolte (' pri- mary areolae') break into each other, so as to give rise to the ' secondary areolae,' or medullary spaces of II. Miiller. These spaces are filled with

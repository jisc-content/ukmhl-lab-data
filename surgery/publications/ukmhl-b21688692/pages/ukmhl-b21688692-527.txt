The branches of this vessel are :— PancreaticBB parvse. Gastric (Vasa brevia). Pancreatica magna. Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The 'pancreatic are numerous small branches derived from the splenic as it runs behind the upper border of the pancreas, supplying its middle and left parts. One of these, larger than the rest, is given off from the splenic near the left extremity of the pancreas; it runs from left to right near the posterior surface of the gland, following the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called the pancreatica magna. These vessels anastomose with the pancreatic branches of the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. The gastric (vasa hrevia) consist of from five to seven small branches, which arise either from the termination of the splenic artery, or from its terminal

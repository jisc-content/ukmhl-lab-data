MUSCLES AND FASCTyl^. 304 lielations. By its siqierfi- cial surface, with the Gluteus niaximus behind, tho Tensor vaginoB fomoris, and deep fas- cia in front. By its deep surface, with tho Gluteus mi- nimus and the gluteal vessels and Superior gluteal netve. Its anterior harder is blended with the Gluteus minimus. Its posterior harder lies pa- rallel with the Piriformis, the gluteal vessels interven- ing. This muscle should now be divided near its insertion and turned upwards, when the Glu- teus minimus will be exposed; The Gluteios Minimus, the smallest of the three glutei, is placed immediately beneath the preceding. It is fan- ghaped, arising from the outer ■ surface of the ilium, between the middle and inferior curved lines, and behind, from the margin of the great sacro- sciatic notch: the fibres con- verge to the deep surface of a radiated aponeurosis, which, terminating in a tendon, is inserted into an impression on the anterior border of the great trochanter. A synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon and the great tro- chanter. Eelations. By its superfi- cial surface, with the GliltetiS medius, and the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. By its deep siorface, with the ilium, the reflected tendon of the tlectus femoris, and cap- sular ligament of the hip- joint. Its antetior margin is blended with the Gluteus me- dius. Its posterior margin is often joined with the tendon of the Pyriformis. The Pyriformis is a flat muscle, pyramidal in shape, lying almost parallel with the posterior margin of the Gluteus medius. It is situ- ated partly within the pelvis at its posterior part, and partly 190.--Muscles of tho Hip and Thigh. jistnef TIttmsivi SARTORIUS ftCMl-TLNDINOEUS — ICMI-MCMORANOSUS —

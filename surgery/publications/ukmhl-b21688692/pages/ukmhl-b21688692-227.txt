HUMERUS. 91 formed by an extension into it of the centre of ossification which belongs to the spine the extent of which varies in diiferent cases. The two sepai-ate nuclei unite and then join with the extension carried in from the spine. These various epiphyses become joined to the bone between the ages of twenty-two and twenty- 86.—Plan of the Development of the Scapula. By Seven Centres. The epiphyses (except one for the Coracoid process) appear from fifteen to seventeen years, and unite between twenty-two and twenty-five years of age. five years. Sometimes failure of union between the acromion process and spine occurs, the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation ; in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.

They pass outwards in a straight course between the tubes o£ the medullary structure and ^« above stated, the vente interlobulares, form the proper renal vcms (figs. 3^5, 3»^./;- These vessels, Venm Pvoprioi Benales, accompany the arteries of tlie same name running along the entire length of the sides of the pyramids ; and, having received in their course the efferents from the Malpighian bodies in the cortical structure adjacent, quit the kidney proper to enter the sinus. In this cavity they inosculate with the corresponding veins from the other pyramids to form The Renal Vein, which, passing through the hilum, opens into the vena cava inferior; the left being longer than the right, from having to cross in fi-ont of the abdominal aorta. Nerves of the Kidney. The nerves of the kidney although small, are about fifteen in number. They have small ganglia developed upon them and are derived from the solar plexus, the lower and outer part of the semilunar ganglion, and fi-om the lesser and smallest splanchnic nerves. They communicate with the spermatic plexus, a circumstance which may explain the sympathy that exists between the kidney and testicle. So far as they have been traced, they seem to accompany the renal artery and its branches, but their exact mode of termination is not known. The lymphatics consist of a superficial and deep set which terminate in the lumbar glands. Connective tissue, or intertuhular stroma. Although the tubules and vessels are closely packed, a certain small amount of connective tissue, continuous with the capsule, binds them firmly together. This tissue was first described by Goodsir and subsequently by Bowman. Ludwig and Zawarykin have observed distinct fibres passing around the Malpighian bodies ; and Henle has seen them between the straight tubes composing the medullary structure. The Ureters, The term Ureter is generally restricted to that portion of the renal duct which is between the pelvis of the kidney and the bladder, but in this description the calices and pelvis of the kidney will be included in its composition. So that the ureter, or excretory duct, of the kidney will be said to consist of three portions: its cuplike commencements, the calices, including the infundibula; its dilated portion, the pelvis ; and its tubular portion, the ureter proper. The calices are cup-like tubes encircling the apices of the Malpighian pyramids ; but inasmuch as one calyx may include two or even more papillse, their number is generally less than the pyramids themselves, the former being from seven to thirteen, whilst the latter vary from eight to eighteen. These cahces converge into the three infundibula, an upper, middle, and lower, which by their junction form the pelvis, or dilated portion of the ureter; which latter, gradually narrowing, becomes continuous with the ureter proper. The portion last mentioned, where the pelvis merges into the ureter proper, is found opposite the transverse process of the third lumbar vertebra on the left, and the fourth on the right side ; at either of which situations it is accessible behind the peritoneum (see fig. 341, p. 633).

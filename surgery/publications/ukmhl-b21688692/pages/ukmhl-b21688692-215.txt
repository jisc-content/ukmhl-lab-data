The Ribs. The Ribs are elastic arches of bone, whicli form the chief part of the thoracic walls. They are twelve in number on each side; but this number may be increased by the development of a cervical or lumbar rib, or may be diminished to eleven. The first seven are connected behind with the spine, and in front with .the sternum, through the intervention of the costal caii;ilages; they are called vertebro- sternal, ov true ribs. The remaining five are false ribs ; of these the first three, being connected behind with the spine, and in front with the costal cartilages, are usually called the vertehro-costal, but would be better named the vertebro- chondral ribs : the last two are connected with the vertebrae only, being free at their anterior extremities; they are termed ver- tebral or floating ribs. The ribs vary in their direction, the upper ones being placed nearly at right angles with the spine, the lower ones obliquely, so that the anterior extremity is lower than the posterior. The extent of obliquity reaches its maximum at the ninth rib, and gradu- ally decreases from that rib to the twelfth. The ribs are situated one below the other in such a manner that spaces are left between them, which are called intercostal spaces. Their length corre- sponds to the length of the ribs, their breadth is more considerable in front than behind, and between the upper than be- tween the lower ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the seventh, when they again diminish to the twelfth. In breadth they decrease from above downwards; in each rib the greatest breadth is at the sternal extremity. Comwon characters of the Bibs (fig. 75). A rib from the middle of the series should be taken in order to study the common characters of the ribs. Each rib presents two extremities, a posterior or vertebral, an anterior or sternal, and an intei'vening portion, the

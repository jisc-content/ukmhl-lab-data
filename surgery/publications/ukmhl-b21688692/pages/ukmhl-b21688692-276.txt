140 THE SKELETON. non-articular aurfaco (or base of the wedgo), for the attachment of a large tendon. It presents for examination six surfaces. The internal surface is subcutaneous, and forms part of the inner border of tlie foot; it is broad, quadrilateral, iVnd presents at its anterior inferior angle a smooth oval facet over which the tendon of the Tibialis anticus muscle glides; in the rest of its extent it is rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The external surface is concave, presenting, along its superior and posterior borders, a narrow surface for articulation with the middle cuneiform behind, and second metatarsal bone m front in the rest of its extent, it is rough for the attachment of ligaments, and prominent below, where it forms part of the tuberosity. The ani«m. surface, Hdnev shaped articulates with the metatarsal bone of the great toe. ilie vosterhr mrface is triangular, concave, and articulates with the innermost and faro-eat of the three facets on the anterior surface of the scaphoid. The inferwr ovilantar surface is rough, and presents a prominent tuberosity at its baxjk part for the attachment of part of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. It also gives attachment in front to part of the tendon of the Tibialis anticus The supenar surface is the narrow pointed end of the wedge, which is directed upwards and outwards : it is rough for the attachment of ligaments. To ascertain to which side it belongs, hold the bone so that its superior narrow edge looks upwards, and the long articular surface forwards ; the external surface, marked by its vertical and horizontal articular facets, will point to the side to ""^^tlulltioS: With four bones: scaphoid, middle cuneiform, first and second metatarsal bones. _ . n . • Attachment of Muscles.

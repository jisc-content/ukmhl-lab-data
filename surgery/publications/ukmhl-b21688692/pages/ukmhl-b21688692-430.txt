294 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE. the lumbar region of the spine and margin of tbo pelvis It arises ft-om the sides of the bodies, from the corresponding intervertebral subs ances, and from the front of the bases of the transverse processes of the last dorsal and aAl the lumbar ver- tebra,. The muscle is connected to the bodies of the vertebr^ by five shps ; each slip is attached to the upper and lower inargins of two vertebra,, and ^ tje .nter- veitebral substance between them; the shps themsolves being connected by the lend nous arches which extend across the constricted part of the bodies and beneath whieh pass the lumbar arteries and sympathetic nerves. These tendinous Deneatu w ^ ^ muscular fibres, and protect the blood-vessels and nerves frot pr su^dSg the action of the muscle. The first slip is attached to the onTiguons margins ff the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebr. ; the ast to the conWous margins of the fourth and fifth lumbar, and to the intervertebral substance From these points the muscle passes down across the bnm of the pelvis, and diminishing gradually in size, passes behind Poupart s ligament, and terminates in a tendon, which, after receiving the fibres of the Ihacus, is mserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur.

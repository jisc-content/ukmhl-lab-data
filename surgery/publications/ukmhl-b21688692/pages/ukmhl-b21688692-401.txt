LATERAL THORACIC REGION. 265 Actions. If the arm has been raised by the Deltoid, the Pectoralis major will, conjointly with the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major, depress it to the side of the chest - and, if acting singly, it will draw the arm across the front of the chest. The Pectoralis minor depresses the point of the shoulder, drawing the scapula downwards and inwards to the thorax. The Snbclavius depresses the shoulder, drawing the clavicle downwards and forwards. When the arms are fixed, all throe muscles act upon the ribs, drawing them upwards and expanding the chest, and thus becoming very important agents in forced inspiration.

Serratus Magnus. The Serratm Magnus (fig. 170) is a broad, thin, ard irregulai^Iy quadrilateral muscle, situated at the upper part and side of the chest. It arises by nine fleshy 170.â€”Muscles of the Chest and Front of the Arm, with the Boundnries of the Axillii. digitahons from the outer surface and upper border of the eight upper ribs (the second rib having two), and from the aponeurosis covering the upper intercostal spaces, and is inser ed into the whole length of the inner margin of the posteHor border of the scapnla. This muscle lias been divided into three portions, a superior, middle, and mfor.or, on account of the difference in the direction, and in tho extent of attachment ot each part. The upper portion, separated from the rest by a cellular interval, is a narrow, but thick fasciculus, which arises by two digitations

3i8 MUSCLES AND FASCI^ffl. The onloTforUon covers the nndor surface of the Abductor minimi digiti; it is thick behind, thin \n front, and extends from the os calcis forwards to the base of the fifth metatarsal bono, into the outer side of wliich it is attached; it is con- tinnous internally with the middle portion of the plantar fascia, and externally with the dorsal fascia. , , , • ^ • The mner portion is very thin, and covers the Abductor pollicis muscle; it is attached behind to the internal annular ligament, and is continuous around the sido of the foot with the dorsal fascia, and externally with the middle portion of the plantar fascia. Muscles of the Foot. These are found in two regions: i. On the dorsum; 2. On the plantar surface. I. Dorsal Region. Extensor Brevis Digitorum. The Fascia on tlie dorsum of the foot is a thin membranous layer, continuous above with the anterior margin of the annular ligament; it becomes gradually lost opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and on eacb side blends with the latei-al portions of the plantar fascia; it forms a sheath for tlie tendons placed on the dorsum of the foot. On the removal of this fascia, the muscles and tendons of the dorsal region of the foot are exposed. The Extensor Brevis Bigitormn (fig. 191) is a broad thin muscle, which arises from the outer side of the os calcis, in front of the groove for the Peroneus brevis ; from the external caloaneo-astragaloid ligament; and from the horizontal portion of the anterior annular ligament. It passes obliquely across the dorsum of the foot, and terminates in four tendons. The innermost, which is the largest, is inserted into the firstphalanx of the great toe, crossing the Dorsalis pedis artery ; the other three into the outer sides of the long extensor tendons of the second third and fourth toes^ Relations. By its ^^e^iioial surface, with the fascia of the foot, the tendons of the Extensor longus digitorum, the Extensor proprius polhcis. By its deep surface, with the tarsal and metatarsal bones, and the Dorsal interossei muscles. Nerves. It is supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. Actio... The Extensor brevis digitorum is an accessory to the long Extensor, ^xtendL the phalanges of the four inner toes, but acting only on the first phalanx of The e?eat toe. The obhquity of its direction counteracts the obhque movement git to ihe toes by the long Extensor, so that, both muscles acting together, the toes are evenly extended. 2. Plantar Region. The muscles in the plantar region of the foot may be divided into three groups, in a iX manner to'those in the hand. Those of the -^ern^ P^^^^^^ .^Te 7rP Ponnected with the great toe, and correspond with those of the thumb , those Tf the eX^al plantar r'egion, are connected with the little toe, and correspond with those of the little finger; and those of the middle plantar region, are con- Te ted witl the tendons intoning between the two former groups. Butm order T f .;ii7nte the dissection of theae muscles, it will be found more convenient to dS?m li e they present themselves, in the order in which they are successively exposed, First Layer.

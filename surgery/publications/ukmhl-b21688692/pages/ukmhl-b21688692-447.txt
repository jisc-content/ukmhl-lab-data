The muscles in this region of the log are subdivided into two layers, superficial and deep. The superficial layer constitutes a powerful muscular mass, forming the calf of the leg. Their large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular apparatus in man, and bears a direct connection with his or- dinary attitude and mode of progression. Superficial Layer.

RUUUUfi LDNCUS » ■HIVIC The Gastrocnemius is the most super- ficial muscle, and forms the greater part of the calf. It arises by two heads, which are connected to the condyles of the femur by two strong flat tendons. The inner head, the larger, and a little the more posterior, arises from a depression at the upper and back part of the inner condyle. The outer head arises from the upper and back part of the external condyle, immediately above the origin of the Pop- liteus. Both heads, also, arise by a few tendinous and fleshy fibres from the ridges which are continued upwards from the condyles to the linea aspera. Bach tendon spreads out into an aponeurosis, which covers the posterior surface of that por- tion of the muscle to which it belongs ; that covering the inner head being longer and thicker than the outer. From the anterior surface of these tendinous ex- pansions, muscular fibres are given ofi*. The fibres in the median line, which cor- respond to the accessory portions of the muscle derived from the bifurcations of the linea aspera, unite at an angle upon a median tendinous raphe below; the remaining fibres converge to the posterior surface of an aponeurosis which covers the front of the muscle, and this, gradu- ally contracting, unites with the tendon of the Soleus, and forms with it the Tendo Achillis. lielations.

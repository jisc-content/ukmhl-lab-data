At this part of the internal surface there is a very deep groove, in which the posterior condyloid foramen, when it exists, has its internal termination. This groove is continuous in the complete skull with that which separates the upper from the lower fossro, and lodges the end of the same sinus, the lateral. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, presenting a shallow depression, the basilar groove, which slopes from behind, upwards and forwards, and supports the medulla oblongata and part of the Pons Varolii, and on each side of the basilar process is a narrow channel, which, when united with a 23.—Occipital Bone.

The superior angle is received into the interval between the posterior superior angles of the two parietal bones : it corresponds with that part of the skull in the foetus which is called the posteiior fontanelle. The infenor angle is represented by the square-shaped surface of the basilar process. At an early period of life, a layer of cartilage separates this part of the bone from the sphenoid ; but in the adult, the union between them is osseous The lateral males correspond to the outer ends of the transverse grooves, and are received into the interval between the posterior inferior angles of the parietal and the mastoid portion of the temporal.

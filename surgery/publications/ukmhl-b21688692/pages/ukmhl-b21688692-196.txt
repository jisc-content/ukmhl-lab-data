This suture sometimes presents, near its posterior extremity, the parietal foramen on each side ; and in front, where it joins the coronal suture, a space is occasionally left, which encloses a large Wormian bone. The Coronal Suture {fronto-'parietal) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, and connects the frontal with the parietal bones. It commences at the extremity of the great wing of the sphenoid on one side, and termmates at the same point on the opposite side. The dentations of this suture are more marked at the sides than at the summit, and are so constructed that the frontal rests on the parietal above, whilst laterally the frontal supports the parietal. The Lamhdoid Suture (occvpito-parietal), so called from its resemblance to the Greek letter A, connects the occipital with the parietal bones. It commences on each side at the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and inclmes upwards to the end of the sagittal suture. The dentations of this suture are very deep and dis- tinct and are often interrupted by several small Wormian bones. The sutures at the side of the skull are also three in numb-.r: the spheno-parietal, squamo-parietal, and masto-parietal. They are subdivisions of a smgle suture formed between the lower border of the parietal, and the temporal and sphenoid bones, and which extends from the lower end of the lambdoid suture behind, to the lower'end of the coronal suture in front. , ,. „ 4. • The Sphenoparietal is very short; it is formed by the tip of the great wmg of the sphenoid, which overlays the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone.

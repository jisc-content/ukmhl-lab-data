The Pvramidalis is a small pyramidal slip, prolonged downwards from the Occipito-froutalis upon the side of the nose, where it becomes tendinous and blends with the Compressor nasi.

It arises by a pointed extremity from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and passing obliquely downwards and outwards, divides iX two slips, one of which is inserted into the cartdage of the ala of the nose ; the other is prolonged into the upper hp, becoming blended with the Orbi- cularis and Levator labii superioris proprius. p.u„n.1.iV,i Belations.

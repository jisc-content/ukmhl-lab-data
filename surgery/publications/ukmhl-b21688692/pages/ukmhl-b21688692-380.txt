244 MUSCLES AND FASCIJE. suvtaco of a very broad and ihick tendon, .vl.icli is attached internally, to the spines of the sacrum, to tl.e spinous processes of the lumbar and three lower doi-sal vertebra), and the supraspinous ligament; externally, to the back part of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, and to the senes ot eminences on th, PO^^-or part of the sacrum, which represent the transverse processes, where xt blends with the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The muscular fibres form a smgle large fleshy mass, bounded in front by the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebr^, and by the middle lamella of the aponeurosis of origin of the Transversahs muscle Opposite last rib, it diodes into two parts, the Sacro-lumbahs, and the Longissimus "^""'The Hacro-LnmMis (Ilio-Costalis), the external and smaller portion of the Erector spin^e, is inserted, by six or seven flattened tendons, mto the angles of the sLx lower ribs. If this muscle is reflected outwards, it will be seen to be reinforced by a series of muscular slips, which arise from the angles of the ribs; bv means of these the Sacro-lumbalis is continued upwards to the upper ribs, and the cervical portion of the spine. The accessory portions form two additional muscles, the Musculus accessorius and the Cervicalis ascendens. The Musculus aMorms ad Sacro-lumhalem arises, by separate flattened tendons, from the angles of the six lower ribs; these become muscular, and are finally inserted, by separate tendons, into the angles of the six upper ribs. The Cervicalis ascendens * is the continuation of the Accessorius upwards into the neck- it is situated on the inner side of the tendons of the Accessorius, arismg from the angles of the four or five upper ribs, and is inserted by a series of slender tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebra. . The Longissimus Dorsi, the inner and larger portion of the Erector spm^, arises, with the Sacro4umbalis, from the common origin above described. In the lumbar region, where it is as yet blended with the Sacro-lumbahs, some of he fib's are attached to the whole length of the posterior - °^^^^^^^^^I^f^ processes of the lumbar vertebra, to the tubercles at ^^f^^'^^^^^^^ Locesses and to the middle layer of the aponeurosis of origm of the Transversal^ TdoS muscle.

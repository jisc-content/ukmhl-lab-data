RADIO-ULNAR. 179 In combination with any position of flexion or extension, the head of the radius can be rotated in the upper radio-ulnar joint, carrying the hand with it. The hand is articulated to the lower surface of the radius only, and the concave or sig- moid surface on the lower end of the radius travels round the lower end of the ulna. The latter bone is excluded from the wrist-joint (as will be seen in the sequel) by the triangular fibro-cartilage. Thus, rotation of the head of the radius, round an axis which passes through the external condyle of the humerus, imparts circular movement to the hand through a very considerable arc. If it is necessary to turn the hand upwards and downwards without changing its place (as in using a corkscrew), this circular movement is obviated by rapid instinctive compensating changes in the position of the elbow. VI. Radio-Ulnar Articulations. The articulation of the radius with the ulna is effected by ligaments, which connect together both extremities as well as the shafts of these bones. They may, consequently, be subdivided into three sets the superior radio-ulnar 2. the middle radio-ulnar; and, 3. the inferior radio-ulnar articulations. 1, Superior Radio-Ulnar Articulation. This articulation is a lateral ginglymus. The bones entering into its forma- tion are the inner side of the circumference of the head of the radius rotating within the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. These surfaces are covered with cartilage, and invested with a duplicature of synovial membrane, continuous with that which Hnes the elbow-joint. Its only ligament is the annular or orbi- cular. The Orbicular Ligament (fig. 133) is a strong, flat band of ligamentous fibres which surrounds the head of the radius, and retains it in firm connection with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. It forms about three-fourths of a fibrous ring attached by each end to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity, and is broader at the upper part of its circumference than below, by which means the head of the radius is more securely held in its position. Its outer surface is strengthened by the external lateral ligament of the elbow, and affords origin to part of the Supinator brevis muscle. Its imier surface is smooth, and Hned by synovial membrane Actions. The movement which takes place in this articulation is limited to rotation_ of the head of the radius within the orbicular ligament, and upon the lesser ^.gmoid cavity of the ulna; rotation forwards being called pronation-, rotation backwards, supination. 2.

It lodges in the foetus the iTj IS suurtei imu ou«, fibrous cord, the obhterated remains of ductus venosus, and in the adult a sleudei nwoua , %re"—a or p^tal fissure, is a short hut deep fi-re aW ^ inohes in length, extending transversely across the ^^^^^^^ to its posterior than its anterior border.

Besides this vein, the fissui-e transmits the hepatic .rtery ^d nerveiand the hepatic duct and lymphatics. /^^^^^/f^^T le t and fissure, the hepatic duct lies m front to the right, the hepatic artery to the left, and the portal vein behind and between (fig. 351). 345.—The Liver. Under Surface. The fissure for the gall-hlaclder- (fossa cystis fellem) is a shallow, oblong fossa, placed on the under surface of the right lobe, parallel with the longitudinal fissure. It extends from the anterior free margin of the liver, which is occa- sionally notched for its reception, to near the right extremity of the transverse fissure. The fissure for the vena cava is a short deep fissure, occasionally a complete canal, which extends obliquely upwards from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure, to the posterior border of that organ, where it joins the fissure for the ductus venosus. On slitting open the inferior vena cava which is contained in it, a deep fossa is seen, at the bottom of which the hepatic veins communicate with this vessel. This fissure is separated from the transverse fissure by the lobus caudatus, and from the longitudinal fissure by the lobulus Spigelii. Lobes. The lobes of the liver, like the ligaments and fissures, are five in number : the right lobe, the left lobe, the lobus quadratus, the lobulus Spigelii, and the lobus caudatus. The right lohe is much larger than the left; the proportion between them being as six to one. It occupies the right hypochondrium, and is separated from the left lobe, on its upper surface, by the longitudinal hgament; on its under surface, by the longitudinal fissure ; and in front, by a deep notch. It is of a quadrilateral form, its under surface being marked by three fissures : the transverse fissure, the fissure for the gall-bladder, and the fissure for the inferior vena cava; and by two shallow impressions, one in front (imprcssio colica), for the hepatic flexure of the

HEART-BRIGHT VENTRICLE. 657 The Right Ventricle is triangular in form and extends from the nght auricle to near the apex of the heart. Its anterior or upper surfaee is rounded and convex, and forms the larger part of the front of the heart. Its posterior or nuu u;ii<.i ,^ J.1 ^-nn-n^-ilivn oTTi and forms oulv a smEU part under surface is flattened, rests upon the Uiapliragm, anu luiu j i of the hack of the heart.' Its inL wall is formed by the partition between the two ventricles, the septun. ventnadoruM, the surface ol ^.^ ^^.^^^X;^^^^ bulges into the cavity of the right ventricle.

The walls of the right ventncle are t^mnei than those of the left, the proportion between them being as i to 2 (Bizot) The wall is thickest at the base, and gradually becomes thinner towards the apex, ine cavity, which equals that of the left ventricle, is capable of contaimng abont two fluid ounces. To exammethe interior, an incision should he made a httle to the right of th^ anterior ventricular groove from the pulmonary artery to the apex of the heart, an<l should be carried up ft-om_ thence along the right border of the ventricle, as far as the auriculo- ventricular opening.

And a muscular and tendinous apparatus connected with the tricuspid valve :— ColumuEe carnese. Chordae tendine^. The auricido-ventricidar orifice is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is situated at the base of the ventricle, near the right border of the heart, and corresponds to the centre of the sternnm between the third costal cartilages. The opening is about an inch in diameter,* oval from side to side, surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered, by the lining mem- brane of the heart, and rather larger than the corresponding aperture on the left side, being sufficiently large to admit the ends of three fingers. It is guarded by the tricuspid valve. The opening of tlve pulmonary artery is circular in form, and situated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, close to the septum ventriculorum. It is placed on the left side of the auriculo-ventricular opening, upon the anterior aspect of the heart, and corresponds to the upper border of the third costal cartilage of the left side, close to the sternum. Its orifice is gnarded by the pulmonary semilunar valves. The tricuspid valve consists of three segments of a triangular or trapezoidal shape, formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane of the heart, strengthened by a layer of fibrous tissue, and containing, according to Kiirschner and Senac, muscular fibres. These segments are connected by their bases to the aui-iculo- ventricular orifice, and by their sides with one another, so as to form a continuous annular membrane, which is attached round the margin of the auriculo-ventricular opening, their free margins and ventricular surfaces afibrding attachment to a number of dehcate tendinous cords, the cTiord.ce. tendinece. The largest and most * In the Pathological Transactions, vol. vi. p, 119, Dr. Peacock has given some careful researches upon the weight and dimensions of the heart in health and disease. He states, as the result of his investigations, that, in the healthy adult heart, the right auriculo- ventncular aperture has a mean circumference of 54-4 lines, or 4lf inches; the left auriculo-ventricular aperture a mean circumference of 44-3 lines, or 35I inches; the pul- monic orifice of 40 lines, or 3if inches ; and tlie aortic orifice of 35-5 lines, or 3/j inches : hut the dimensions of the oiitices varied grently in different cases, the right auriculo- ventricular aperture having a range of from 45 to 60 lines, and the others in the same proportion, U U '

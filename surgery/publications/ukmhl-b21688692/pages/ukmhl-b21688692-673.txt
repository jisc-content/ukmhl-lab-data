MUSCULO-SPIRAL. 537 j86.â€”The Suprascapular, Circumflex, and Musculo-Spiral Nerves. Sujint-S'ra/jufar- The dorsal cutaneous branch arises about two inches above the wrist; it passes backwards beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, perforates the deep fascia and runnino- alons the ulnar side of the wrist and hand, supplies the inner side of the little fiLer, and the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers ; it also sends a communicating filament to that branch of the radial nerve which supplies the adjoining sides of the middle and ring fingers. The artMar filaments to the wnst are also supplied by the ulnar nerve. The supeificial palmar branch supplies the Palmaris brevis, and the integument on the inner side of the hand, and terminates in two digital branches, which are distributed, one to the ul- nar side of the little finger the other to the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers, the latter com- municating with a branch from the median. The deep palmar branch passes between the Abduc- tor and Flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles, and follows the course of the deep palmar arch beneath the flexor tendons. At its origin, it supplies the muscles of the little finger. As it crosses the deep part of the hand, it sends two branches to each interos- seous space, one for the Dorsal and one for the Palmar interosseous mus- cle, the branches to the second and third Palmar interossei supplying fila- ments to the two inner Lumbricales muscles. At its termination between the thumb and index finger, it supplies the Adductor pol- licis and the inner head of the Flexor brevis pollicis. The Musculo-Spiral Neeve (fig. 286), the larg- est branch of the brachial plexus, supplies the mus- cles of the back part of the arm and fore-arm, and the integument of the same parts, as well as that of the hand. It arises from the posterior cord of tho brachial plexus by a com- mon trunk with the cir- ^mflex nerve. At its commencement it is jjlaced yinxriilo-Siiiraf

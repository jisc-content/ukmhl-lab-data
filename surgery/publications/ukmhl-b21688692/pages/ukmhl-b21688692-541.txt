The coccygeal branch runs inwards, pierces the great sacro-sciatic liga- ment, and supplies the Gluteus maximus, tbe in- tegument, and other struc- tures on the back of tbe coccyx. The inferior gluteal branches, three or four in number, supply the Gluteus maximus muscle. The comes nervi ischia- dici is a long slender vessel, which accompanies the great sciatic nerve for a short distance; it then penetrates it, and runs in its substance to the lower part of tbe thigh. Tbe muscular branches supply tbe muscles on tbe back part of the hip, anas- tomosing with tbe gluteal, internal and external cir- cumflex, and superior per- forating arteries. Some articular branches are distributed to the cap- sule of tbe hip-joint. The Ilio-Lumbar Artery ascends beneatli tbe Psoas muscle and external iliac vessels, to tbe upper part of tbe iliac fossa, where it divides into a lumbar and an iliac branch. Tbe himbar branch sup- plies the Psoas and Quad- ratus lumborum muscles, anastomosing with tbe last lumbar artery, and sends a small spinal branch through tbe intervertebral foramen, between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, into tbe spinal cana,l, to supply the spinal cord and its membranes. The ihac brwiich descends to supply the Iliacus internus, some offsets running between the muscle and the bone, one of which enters an oblique canal to supply the diploe, whilst others run along tbe crest of the ilium, distributing branches to the Gluteal and Abdominal muscles, and anastomosing in their coui-se with the gluteal, circumflex iliac, exteraal circumflex, and epigastric arteries.

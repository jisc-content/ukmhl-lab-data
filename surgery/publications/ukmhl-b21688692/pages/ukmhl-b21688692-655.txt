The Spinal Accessory Nerve consists of two parts: one, the accessory part to the vagus, and the other the spinal portion. , v x ci t- The accessory part, the smaller of the two, arises by four or five dehcate h aments from the lateral tract of the cord below the roots of the vagus ; these filaments may be traced to a nucleus of grey matter at the back of the medulla, below the origin of the vagus. It joins, in the "jugular foramen, with the upper ganglion ot the° vagus by one or two filaments, and is continued into the vagus below the •second ganglion. It gives branches to the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the vagus. The spinal portion, firm in texture, arises by several filaments from the lateral tract of the cord, as low down as the sixth cervical nerve; the fibres pierce the tract, and are connected with the anterior horn of the grey matter of the cord. This portion of the nerve ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, enters the skull through the foramen inagnum, and it is then directed outwards to the jugular foramen, through which it passes, lying in the same sheath as the pneumogastric, separated from it by a fold of the arachnoid, and is here connected with the accessory portion. At its exit from the jugular foramen, it passes backwards behind the internal jugular vein, and descends 'obliquely behind the Digastric and Stylo-liyoid muscles 'to the upper part of the

675 LARYNX. with the lining membrane of the trachea. It is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium, below the superior vocal cord; but, above this point, the cilue are found only in front, as high as the middle of the epiglottis. In the rest of its extent, the epithelium is of the squamous variety. Glands. The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with numerous muciparous glands, the orifices of which are found in nearly every part; they are very numerous upon the epiglottis, being lodged in Httlo pits m its substance ; they are also found in large numbers along the posterior margin of the aryteno- epiglottidean fold, in front of the arytenoid cartilages, where they are termed the arytenoid glands. They exist also in large numbers upon the inner surface of the sacculus laiyngis. None are found on the vocal cords. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries of the larynx are the laryngeal branches derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins empty themselves into the superior, middle, and inferior thyi-oid veins. The lymphatics terminate in the deep cervical glands. The nerves are the superior laryngeal, and the inferior or recurrent laryngeal branches of the pueumogastric nerves, joined by filaments 367.â€”Front View of Cartilages of Larynx: the Trachea and Bronchi. from the sympathetic. The superior laryngeal nerves supply the mucous mem- brane of the laiynx, and the Crico-thyroid muscles. The inferior laryngeal nerves supply the remaining muscles. The Arytenoid muscle is supplied by both nerves.

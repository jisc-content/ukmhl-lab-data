THE SKELETON. 132 Structure. Like that of the other long bones. Development. By three centres (fig. iii) : one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the same time as in the femur, the fifth week, and gradually extends towards either ex tremity. The centre for the upper epiphysis appears at birth ; it is flat- tened in form, and has a thin tongue- shaped process in front, which forms the tubercle. That for the lower epiphysis appears in the second year. The lower epiphysis joins the shaft at about the twentieth year, and the upper one about the twenty-fifth year. Two additional centres occa- sionally exist, one for the tongue- shaped process of the upper epiphysis, the tubercle, and one for the inner malleolus. Articulations. With three bones: the femur, fibula, and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles. To the inner tuberosity, the Semimembra- nosus: to the outer tuberosity, the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum: to the shaft, its internal surface, the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semitendinosus; to its external sur- face, the Tibialis anticus ; to its poste i- i I.—rian of the Developnieut of the Tibia.

The Eibula. (Figs. 109, no.) The Fibula is situated at the outer side of the leg. It is the smaller of the two bones, and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones ; it is placed nearly parallel with the tibia. Its upper extremity is small, placed below the level of the knee-joint, and excluded from its formation; the lower extremity inclines a little forwards, so as to be on a plane anterior to that ot the upper end, projects below the tibia, and forms the outer ankle. It presents tor examination a shaft and two extremities. The TJpver Bxtremity, or Bead, is of an irregular rounded form, presentmg above a flattened articular facet, directed upwards and inwards, for articulation with a corresponding facet on the external tuberosity of the tibia._ On the outer side is a thick and rough prominence, continued behind into a pointed eminence, the styloid process, which projects upwards fi-om the P0«^«-^°^" ;f ^^^"^^X The prominence gives attachment to the tendon of the Biceps ---1^'to th^ long external lateral ligament of the knee, the hgament dmdmg t^^^ two parts.

An incision Bhould now be made through the corpus calloeum, on either side of the raphe, . ■when two large irregular-shaped cavities will be exposed, which extend through a great part i of the length of each hemisphere. These are the lateral ventricles. The lateral ventncles are serous cavities, formed by the upper part of the general ventricular space in the interior of the brain. They are lined by a thin diaphanous linino- membrane, covered with ciliated epithelium, and moistened by a serous 264.—The Lateral Ventricles of the Brain. fluid which is sometimes, even in health, secreted in considerable quantity. These cavities are two in number, one in each hemisphere, and they are separated from each other by a vertical septum, the septum lucidmn. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity, or body, and three smaller cavities or cornua, which extend from it in different directions. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards, into the substance of the anterior lobe. The posterior cornu, called the digital cavity, curves backwards into the posterior lobe. The middle cornu descends into the middle lobe. _ , • ^ if The central cavity, or body of the lateral ventricle, is triangular m form, it -hmmded above, by the under surface of the corpus callosum, which forms the of thVcav%.

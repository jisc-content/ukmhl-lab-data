174 ARTICULATIONS. happily says, 'is bo adjusted as to cuablo either bone to turn in a hinge-hke manner upon a vortical axis drawn through the other, and it permits the surfaces of the scapula, like the baskets in a round-about swing, to look the same way m eveiy position, or nearly so.' Again, when the whole arch formed by the clavicle and scapula rises and falls (in elevation or depression of the shoulders), the jomt between these two bones enables the scapula still to mamtam its lower part m contact with the ribs. III. Proper Ligaments op the Scapula. (Fig. 131.) The proper hgaments of the scapula are, the Coraco-acromial. Transverse. The Coraoo-acromial Ligament is a broad, thin flat band of a triangular shape extended transversely above the upper part of the shoulder-joint, between he co^acoid and acromio; processes. It is attached, by its apex to the summit of the acromion iust in front of the articular surface for the clavicle; and by its W base to the whole length of the outer border of the coracoid process. Its posterior fibres are directed obliquely backwards and outwards, its anterior fibres transversely Th lament completes the vault formed by the coracoid and acromion processes for the^protection of the head of the humerus.

142 THE SKELETON. This bono is known by tbe single Iddnoy-sbaped articular surface on its base; the deeply grooved appearance of the plantar surface of its head ; and its great thickness, relatively to its length. When it is placed in its natural position, the concave border of the kidney-shaped articular sui-face on its base points to the side to which the bone belongs. The Secmd is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones, being , prolono-od backwards into the recess formed between the three cuneiform bones. Its ta'>°al extremity is broad above, narrow and rough below. It presents four arti- cular surfaces: one behind, of a triangular form, for articulation with the middle cuneiform : one at the upper part of its internal lateral surface, for articulation with the internal cuneiform ; and two on its external lateral surface, a superior and an inferior, separated by a rough depression. Each of the latter articular sui-faces is divided by a vertical ridge into two parts; the anterior segment of each facet articulates with the third metatarsal; the two posterior (sometimes continuous) with the external cuneiform. The facets on the tarsal extremity of the second metatarsal bone serve at once to distinguish it from the rest and to indicate the foot to which it belongs ; there being one facet at the upper angle of the internal surface, and two facets, each subdivided into two parts, on the external surface, pointing to the side to which the bone belongs. The fact that the two posterior subdivisions of these external facets sometimes run into one should not be forgotten. The Thi/rd articulates behind, by means of a triangular smooth surface, with the external cuneiform ; on its inner side, by two facets, with the second metatarsal; and on its outer side, by a single facet, with the third metatarsal. The latter facet is of circular form, and situated at the upper angle of the base. The third metatarsal is known by its having at its tarsal end two undivided facets on the inner side, and a single facet on the outer. This distmgmshes it from the second metatarsal, in which the two facets, found on one side of its tarsal end, are each subdivided into two. The single facet (when the bone is put in its natural position) is on the side to which the bone belongs. The Fourth is smaller in size than the preceding; its tarsal extremity presents a terminal quadrilateral surface, for ari;iculation with the cuboid ; a smooth facet on the inner side, divided bv a ridge into an anterior portion for ariiculation with the third metatarsal, and a posterior pori^ion for articulation with the external cunei- form • on the outer side a single facet, for articulation with the fifth metatarsal. The fourth metatarsal is known by its having a single fax^et, on either side ot the tarsal extremity, that on the inner side being divided into two parts. It tins subdivision be not recognisable, the fact that its tarsal end is bent somewhat out^ wards will indicate the side to which it belongs, as Mr. Holden points out. The Fifth is recognised by the tubercular eminence on the outer side of its base. It articulates behind, by a triangular surface cut obHquely from without inwards, with the cuboid : and internally, with the fourth metatarsal. The projection on the outer side of this bone at its tarsal end at once distin- miishes it from the others, and points to the side to which it belongs. Articulations. Each bone articulates with the tarsal bones by one extremity, and by t^o otler with the first row of phalanges. The number of tarsal bones with which each metatarsal articulates, is one for the first, three for the .second, one for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the fifth Attaciment of Muscles. To the first metatarsal bone, three: paxt^of the Tii,,ah._ anticus, the Peroneus longus, and Eirst dorsal nterosseous. To the ^' ^hi 00^. the Adductor pollicis, and Fir.st and Second dorsal - erosseou ^ To the h rd L,.. the Adductor nolHcis, Second and Third dorsal, and First plantar inter OSS on To t f^^^^^^^^ the Adductor pollicis. Third and Fourth dorsa^^ and ?lond T)lantar interosseous. To the fifth, five: the Peroneus brevis, I cronous feXt &:trrnimi digiti, Fourth'dorsal, and Third plantar interosseous.

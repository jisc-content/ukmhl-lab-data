i84 ARTICULATIONS. with the four carpal bones on which they are supported, the unciform, os magnum, trapezoid, and trapezium ; and 3. The meniscus, formed by the cuneiform, semi- lunar, and scaphoid ; the pisiform bone having no essential part in the movements of the hand. . , .i i j i These three elements form two joints :—i. The anterior between the hand and meniscus (transverse carpal joint, as itmay be called) mainly ginglymoid m character; 2. The posterior (wrist-joint proper) between the memscus and bones of the forearm, chiefly artlirodiaL , , , « i n ,^ I The ioint between the memscus and the other four bones of the carpus is subdivided into three portions-tho central formed between the deep cup of the semi- lunar above and the head of the os magnum with the adjacent part of the unciform ' below is a ginoaymoid joint in which some rotation is allowed ; the radial portion formed by the scaphoid articulating with a portion of the os magnum, the trape- zoid and trapezium, represents also a ginglymoid joint m which rotation is permitted ; while the ulnar portion or articulation of the cuneiform with the unciform partakes more of the arthrodial character. The axes of movement of these joints are incUned to each other at a considerable angle, so that m flexion of the hand on the forearm the carpal bones are brought together, and on the con- trary are separated in extension. Extension of the hand on the forearm or dorsi-flexion Meyer divides into three movements, corresponding to the three portions of the transverse joint. In the first the semilunar moves in its hinge-joint around the head of the osmagnum and the edge of the unciform until its motion is checked by its bony surface coming into contact with the adjoining portions of those bones. The second part of the movement con- sists of a hinge-like motion of the scaphoid round the os magnum contmued by a rotation of the same bone on a pivot formed by the head of the os magnum until it is checked by the tension of the ligaments uniting it to the trapezium and trapezoid. The third part is effected by the cuneiform which gHdes outwards or towards the radial side on the unciform to a certain extent and carries the semilunar vnth it so that it is disengaged from its contact with the os magnum and uiicitorm, ana undergoes a further separation from those bones towards the radial side. Flexion of the hand on the forearm, or palmar flexion, is accomphshed by the semilunar (with the cuneiform) hinging around the os magnum and unciform, and the scaphoid moving in the same sense until the movement is checked by these two bones coming together. -a Wo It follows from this that the movement of extension in thisjomt is considerable while that of flexion is but slight.* A very trifling rotation is permitted around the head of the os magnum as a pivot; but only to the extent which is deter- mined by the tension of the ligaments connected with that bone. 2 The articulation between the forearm and carpus is formed chiefly by the radius articulating with the scaphoid and semilunar, the articulation between tne triangular cartilage and cuneiform being of subordinate importance ^^^J'^^S^ which divides the two concave surfaces on the end of the radius is the centre ot motion in the chief part of the joint.

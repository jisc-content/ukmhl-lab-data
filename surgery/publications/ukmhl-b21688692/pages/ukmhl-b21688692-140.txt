Its upper Burfaoo is eoncave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on each side ; its lower surface being convex from side to side, concave from before backwa,-ds, and presenting laterally a shallow con- cavity, which receives the corresponding projecting hp of the adjacent vertebm The pedicles are directed obliquely outwards, and the superior intervertebral notches are deeper, but narrower, than the inferior. The Iwrnma^ are narrow lono- thinner above than below, and overlap each other; enclosing the spinal foramen, which is very large, and of a triangular form. The spinous processes are short and bifid at the extremity, to afford greater extent of surfaxje for the attachment of muscles, the two divisions being often of unequal size. They increase in length from the fourth to the seventh. The tramverse processes arc short directed downwards, outwards, and forwards, bifid at their extremity, and marked by a groove along their upper surface, which runs downwards and out- wards from the superior intervertebral notch, and serves for the transmission ot one of the cervical nerves. The transverse processes are pierced at their base by a foramen, for the transmission of the vertebral artery, vein, and plexus of nerves. Eacb process is formed by two roots : the anterior root arises from the side of the body and corresponds to the ribs: the posterior root springs from the junction ot the iiedicle with the lamina, and corresponds with the transverse processes m tlie dorsal re-ion It is by the junction of the two that the foramen for the vertebral vessels is^'formed. The extremities of each of these roots form the anterior and postenor tubercles of the transverse processes. The articular processes are oblique : the superior are of an oval form, flattened and directed upwards and backwards; tbe inferior downwards and forwards. i The peculiar vertebrsB in the cervical region are the first or Ailas ; the second or Axis • and the seventh or Vertelra prominens. The great modifications m the ?orm of the atlas and axis are designed to admit of the nodding and rotatory ""XtL?(fii'named from supporting the globe of the head).

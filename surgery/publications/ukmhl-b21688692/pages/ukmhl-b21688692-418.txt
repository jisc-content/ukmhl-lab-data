MUSCLES AND FASCIA. 282 Belations. By its superficial surface, with the same parts as tlie Extensor ossis metucarpi poUicis. By its deep surface, with the uhm, interosseous membrane, radius, the wrist, the radial vessels, and metacarpal bono ot the thumb. The Tixle,i.or Inddcis is a narrow elongated muscle, placed on tho inner side of and parallel with, the preceding. It arises from the posterior surface ot the shaft of the ulna, below the origin ^^^^ Posterior Surface of the Forearm. Deep Muscles. of the Extensor secundi intor- nodii pollicis, and from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes with the Ex- tensor communis digitorum tbrougli the same canal in the annular ligament, and subse- quently joins that tendon of the Extensor communiswhich belongs to the index finger, opposite the lower end of the corresponding metacarpal bone, lying to the ulnar side of the tendon from the common Extensor. It is finally in- serted into the second and third phalanges of the index finger in the manner already described. Belations. They are simi- lar to those of the preceding , muscles. Nerves. The Supinator longus. Extensor carpi radialis longior, and Anconeus, are supplied by branches from the musculo-spiral nerve. The remaining muscles of the ra- dial and posterior brachial regions, by the posterior in- terosseous nerve. Actions. The muscles of the radial and posterior bra- chial regions, which comprise all the Extensor and Supina- tor muscles, act upon the fore- arm, wrist, and hand; they are the direct antagonists of tbe Pronator and Flexor muscles. The Anconeus as- sists the Triceps in extending the foreai-m. The Supinator longus and brevis are the supinators of the forearm and hand ; the former muscle mor6 especially acting as a supina- tor -when the limb is pronated. When supination has been produced, the Supinator lon- gus, if still continuing to act, flexes the forearm. The Ex- EVTEN 30R CARPI ULNARIS

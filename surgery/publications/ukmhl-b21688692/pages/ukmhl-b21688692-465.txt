ARCH OF AORTA. 329 Relations. The ascending parb of the arch is covered at its commencement by the trunk of the pulmonary artery and. the right appendix auricute, and, higher up, is separated from the sternum by the pericardium, some loose areolar tissue, and the remains of the thymus gland; hehind, it rests upon the right pulmonary vessels and root of the right lung. On the rigid side, it is in relation with the superior vena cava and right auricle ; on the left side, with the pulmonary artery. Plan of the Relations or the Ascending Part of the Auch. In Front.

The second or transverse portion of the arch commences at the upper border of the second chondro-sternal articulation of the right side in front, and passes from right to left, and from before jbackwards, to the left side of the third dorsal vertebra behind.* Its npper border is usually about an inch below the upper margin of the sternum.

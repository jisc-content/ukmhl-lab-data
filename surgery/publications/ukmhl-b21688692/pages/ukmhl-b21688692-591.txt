A few smaU glands are also foimd on the front and sides of the larynx. The deep%rvical glands (fig. 249) are numerous a,nd of large size ; thej forra an nninterrnpted ehahi along the sheath of the earotid artery and internal ju^kr vein, lying by the side of the pharynx, cBSophagus, and trachea, and extending from the base of the skull to the thorax, where they oonomunicate with the lymphatic glands in that cavity. 249.â€”The Deep Lymphatics and Glands of the Neck mid Thorax. The superficial and deep cervical lymphatics are a continuation of those already described on the cranium and face. After traversing the glands in those regions, they pass through the chain of glands which lie along the sheath of the carotid vessels, being joined by the lymphatics from the pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland. At the lower part of the neck, after receiving some lymphatics from the thorax, they unite into a single trunk, which terminates on the left side, in the thoracic duct; on the right side, in the right lymphatic duct. Lymphatics of the Upper Extremity. The Lymphatic Glands of the upper extremity (6g. 250) may be subdivided into two sets, superficial and deep.

In the dorsal region, they are posterior both to the articular processes ^""^TheZ^ral surfaces are separated from the posterior by the articular processes in the cervical and lumbar regions, and by the transverse processes m the dorsal. These surfaces present in front the sides of the bodies of the vertebra), marked m the dorsal region by the facets for articulation with the heads of the ribs. More posteriorly are the intervertebral foramina, formed by the juxtaposition of the inter- vertebral notches, oval in shape, smallest in the cervical and upper part of the dorsal regions, and gradually increasing in size to the last lumbar. They are situated between the transverse processes in the neck, and in front of them in the back and loins, and transmit the spinal nerves. The lase of the vertebral column is formed by the under surface of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra; and the srnnmit by the upper surface of the atlas. The vertehral or spinal canal follows tbe different curves of the spine; it is largest in those regions in which the spine enjoys the greatest freedom of movement, as in the neck and loins, where it is wide and triangular ; and narrow and rounded in the back, where motion is more limited. THE SKULL. The Skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column, is composed of four vertebrse, the elementary parts of which are specially modified in form and size, and almost immoveably connected, for the reception of the brain, and special organs of the senses. These vertebrae are the occipital, parietal, fi-ontal, and nasal. Descriptive anatomists, however, divide the skull into two parts, the Cranium and the Face. The Cranium {updvoc, a helmet), is composed of eight bones : viz., the occipital, two parietal, frontal, two temporal, sphenoid, and ethmoid. The face is composed of fourteen bones : viz., the two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, two malar, two palate, two inferior tiirhinated, vomer, and inferior maxillary. The ossicula auditus, the teeth, and Wormian hones, are not included in this enumeration. Occipital. Cranium, 8 hones. <^ Shull, 22 hones. < Face, 14 hones. <( Two Parietal. Frontal. Two Temporal.

This space is tne seat of an abundant serous secretion, the cerebro-spinal fluid, which falls up t le interval between the arachnoid and pia mater. The subarachnoid space usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the bram by means ot an opening in the inferior boundary of the fourth ventricle. . The sac of the arachnoid also contains serous fluid; this is, however, small m quantity compared with the cerebro-spinal fluid. Structure. The arachnoid consists of bundles of white fibrous and elastic tissues intimately blended together. Its outer surface is covered with a layer of scaly- epithelium. It is destitute of vessels, and the existence of nerves m it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The cerehro-spinal fluid fiUs up the subarachnoid space, keeping the opposed surfaces of the arachnoid membrane in contact. It is a clear, limpid fluid, having a saltish taste, and a slightly alkaline reaction. According to Lassaigne, it consists of 98-5 parts of water, the remaining 1-5 per cent, being solid matters, animal and saline. It varies in quantity, being most abundant in old persons, and is quickly reproduced. Its chief use is probably to afford mechanical protection to tlie nervous centres, and to prevent the effects of concussions communicated from without. PiA Mateb. The pia mater is a vascular membrane, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. It consists of a minute plexus of blood-vessels, held together by an extremely fine areolar tissue. It invests the entire surface of the brain, dipping down between the convolutions and laminae, and is prolonged into the interior, forming the velum interpositum and choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle. Upon the surfaces of the hemispheres, where it covers the grey matter of the convolutions, it is very vascular, and gives off from its inner surface a multitude of minute vessels, which extend perpendicularly for some distance into the cerebral substance. At the base of the brain, in the situation of the sub- stantia perforata and locus perforatus, a number of long straight vessels are given off, which pass through the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. On the cerebellum the membrane is more delicate, and the vessels from its inner surface are shorter. Upon the crura cerebri and pons Varolii its characters are altogether changed ; it here presents a dense fibrous structure, marked only by slight traces of vascularity. According to Pohmann and Arnold, this membrane contains numerous lymphatic vessels. Its nerves are derived from the sympathetic, and also from the third, sixth, seventh, eighth, and spinal accessory. They accompany the branches of the arteries. The Bratn, The brain (enceplialon) is that portion of the cerebro-spinal axis that is con- tained in the cranial cavity. It is divided into four principal parts: viz., the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebrum forms the largest portion of the encephalon, and occupies a considerable part of the cavity of the cranium, resting in the anterior and middle

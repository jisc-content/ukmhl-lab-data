736 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. In other cases, and this is the moi'e frequent variotj', the intestine is either forced through the Hbrcs of the coujoiued tendon, or the tendon is gradually dis- tended iu front of it, so as to form a complete investment for it. The intestine then enters the lower end of the inguinal canal, escapes at the external ring lying on the inner side of the cord, and receives additional coverings from the superficial fascia and the integument. This form of hernia has the same coverings as the oblique variety, excepting that the conjoined tendon is substituted for the Cremaster, and the infundibulura fascia is replaced by a part of the general fascia transveraalis. The seat of stricture in both varieties of direct hernia is most frequently at the ^ neck of the sac, or at the external ring. In that form of hernia which perforates the conjoined tendon, it not unfrequently occurs at the edges of the fissure througli which the gut passes. In dividing the stricture, the incision should in all cases be directed upwards. If the hernial protrusion passes into the inguinal canal, but does not escape from the external abdominal ring, it forms what is called incomplete clired hernia. This form of hernia is usually of small size, and in corpulent persons very difficult of detection. Direct inguinal hernia is of much less frequent occurrence than the oblique, their comparative frequency being, according to Cloquet, as one to five. It occurs far more frequently in men than in women, on account of the larger size of the external ring in the former sex. It differs from the oblique in its smaller size and globular form, dependent most probably on the resistance offered to its progress by the transversalis fascia and conjoined tendon. It differs also in its position, being placed over the pnbes, and not in the course of the inguinal canal. The epio-astric artery runs on the outer or iliac side of the neck of the sac and the "spermatic cord along its external and posterior side, not directly behind it, as in oblique inguinal hernia.

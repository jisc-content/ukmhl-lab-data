Bach of the larger branches of the arteries supplies chiefly that region of the organ in which the branch ramifies, having^no anasto- mosis with the majority of the other branches. The ca^llaries, supported by the minute trabeculse, traverse the pulp in all directions, and terminate either directly in the veins, or open into lacunar spaces, from which the veins originate. The veins are of large size, as compared with the size of the organ; and their distribution is limited, like that of the arteries, to the supply of a particular part- of the gland ; they are much larger and moi'e numerous than the arteries. They originate, lat, as continuations of the capillaries of the arteries; 2nd, by inter- cellular spaces communicating with each other ; 3rd, by distinct caecal pouches. By this junction they form from four to six branches, which emerge from the hilum; and these uniting, form the splenic vein, the largest branch of the vena portae. The lymphatics form a deep and superficial set; they pass through the lym- phatic glands at the hilum, and terminate in the thoracic duct. The nerves are derived from branches of the right and left semilunar ganglia, and right pneumogastric nerve.

These vessels usually join Vmt'ties in Mcscnl^ delations.* The brachial artery is occasionally concealed so^^f P^^J of its course, by muscular or tendinous slips derived from various sources. In the upper third of the arm, the brachial vessels and median nerve have been seen concealed to the extent of three inches, by a muscular layer of considerable thickness, derived from the <j-oi'aco- brachiaUs, which passed round to the inner side of the vessel, and joined the internal head ot the Triceps In the lower half of the arm the artery is occasionally concealed by a broad thin head to the Biceps muscle. A narrow fleshy slip from the Biceps has been seen to cross the artery, concealmg it for an inch and a half, its tendon ending in the aponeurosis coverino- the Pronator teres. A muscular and tendinous slip has been seen to arise from the external bicipital ridge by a long tendon, cross obliquely behind the long tendon of the Biceps, and end in a fleshy belly, which appears on the inner side of the arm between the Biceps and Coraco-brachialis, passes down along the inner edge of tb.e former, and crosses the artery very obliquely, so as to lie in front of it for three inches, and, finally, gives rise to a narrow flattened tendon, which is inserted into the aponeurosis over the Pronator teres. A tendinous slip, arising from the deep part of the tendon of the Pectoralis major, has been seen to cross the artery obliquely at or below the Coraco-brachialis, and join the intermuscular septum above the inner condyle. The Brachialis anticus not unfrequently projects at the outer side of the artery, and occasionally overlaps it, sending inwards, across the artery, an aponeurosis which binds the vessel down upon the Brachialis anticus. Sometimes, a fleshy slip from the muscle covers the vessel, in one case to the extent of three inches. In some cases of high origin of the Pronator teres, an aponeurosis extends from it to join the Brachialis anticus external to the artery ; a kind of arch being thus formed under which the principal artery and median nerve pass, so as to be concealed for half an inch above the transverse level of the condyle. Surgical Anatomij. Compression of the brachial artery is required in cases of amputation and some other operations in the arm and forearm; and it will be observed, that it may be effected in almost any part of the course of the artery. If pressure is made in the upper part of the limb, it should be directed from within outwards, and if in the lower part, from before backwards, as the artery lies on the inner side of the humerus above, and in front of it below. The most favourable situation is near the insertion of the Coraco- brachialis. The application of a ligature to the brachial artery may be required in cases of wounds of the vessel, and in some cases of wound of the palmar arch. It is also sometimes necessary in cases of aneurism of the brachial, the radial, ulnar, or interosseous arteries. The artery may be secured in any part of its course. The chief guides in determining its position are the surface-markings produced by the inner margin of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps, the known course of the vessel, and its pulsation, which should be carefully felt for before any operation is performed, as the vessel occasionally deviates from its usual position in the arm. In what- ever situation the operation is performed, great care is necessary, on account of the extreme thinness of the parts covering the artery, and the intimate connection which the vessel has throughout its whole course with important nerves and veins. Sometimes a thin layer of muscular fibre is met -svith concealing the artery ; if such is the case, it must be cut across, in order to expose the vessel. In the upper third of the arm the artery may be exposed in the following manner:—The patient being placed horizontally upon a table, the affected limb should be raised from the Hide, and the hand supinated. An incision about two inches in length should be made on the ulnar side of the Coraco-brachialis muscle, and the subjacent fascia cautiously divided, so as * See SxBUTHERs's Anatomical and Fhrjsiohgical Observations.

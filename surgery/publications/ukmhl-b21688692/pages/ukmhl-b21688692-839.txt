Coicpej^a GlaiKi^ Orlfteeif of fluet*. is a triangular, smooth surface, the apex of which is directed forwards; this is the trigonum vesica, or trigone vesicale. It is paler in colour than the rest of the mucous membrane, and never presents any .rugae, even in the collapsed condition of the organ, owing to its intimate adhesion to the sub- jacent tissues. It is bounded on each side by two slight ridges, which pass backwards and outwards to the orifices of the ureters, and correspond with the muscles of these tubes; and at each posterior angle, by the orifices of the ureters, which are placed nearly two inches from each other, and about an inch and a half behind the orifice of the urethra. The trigone corre- sponds with the interval at the base of the bladder, bounded by the prostate in front, and the vesiculae and vasa deferentia on the sides. Projecting from the lower and anterior part of the bladder, into the orifice of the uretln-a, is a slight elevation of mucous mem- brane, called the uvula vesicce. It is formed by a thickening of the prostate. The arteries supplying the bladder are the superior, middle, and infenor vesical, in the male, with additional branchesfromtheuterine,in the female. They are all derived from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac. The veins form a complicated plexus round the neck, sides, and base of the bladder, and terminate in the internal iliac vein.

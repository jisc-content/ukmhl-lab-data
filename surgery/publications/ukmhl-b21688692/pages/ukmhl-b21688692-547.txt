In order to expose the artery in th^s situation, an incision, between two and three inches long, should be niade he cou se of the vessel, the patient lying in the recumbent position, with the hmb slightly flexed, and abd-^cted. A large vein is frequently met with, passing in the course of the artery to join the saphe^a this must be avoided, and the fascia lata having been cautiously divided, and the Sartorius exposed, that muscle must be drawn outwards, in order to lully expose the sheath ot the vessels. The linger being introduced into the wound, and the pulsation of the artery felt, the sheath should be divided over the artery to a sufficient extent to allow ot the introduction of the ligature, but no further; otherwise the nutrition of the coats of the vessel may be interfered with, or muscular branches which arise from the vessel at irregular intervals may be divided. In this part of the operation, a small nerve which crosses the sheath should be avoided. The auem-ism needle must be carefuUy introduced and kept close to the artery, to avoid the femoral vein, which lies behmd the vessel in this part ot its ^jjg middle of the thigh, an incision should be made through the inteo-ument, between three and four inches in length, over the inner margin of the Sartorius takiu'^ care to avoid the internal saphenous vein, the situation of which may be previously known by compressing it higher up in the thigh. The fascia lata having been divided, and the Sartorius muscle exposed, it should be drawn outwards, when the strong fascia which is stretched across from the Adductors to the Vastus internus, will be exposed, and must be freely divided; the sheath of the vessels is now seen, and must be opened, and the artery secured bypassing the aneurism needle between the vein and artery, in the direction from within outwards. The femoral vein in this situation lies on the outer side of the artery, the long saphenous nerve on its anterior and outer side. It has been seen that the femoral artery occasionally divides into two trunks, below the origin of the profunda. If, in the operation for tying the femoral, two vessels are met with, the" surgeon should alternately compress each, in order to ascertain which vessel is connected with the aneurisraal tumour, or with the bleeding from the wound, and that one only should be tied which controls the pulsation or haemorrhage. If, however, it is necessary to compress both vessels before the circulation in the tumour is controlled, both should be tied, as it ■would be probable that they became re-united, as in the four instances referred to above. _ Collateral Circulation. When the common femoral is tied, the main channels for carrying on the circulation are the anastomoses of the gluteal find circumflex iliac arteries above with the external circumflex below; of the obturator and sciatic above with the internal circumflex below; of the ilio-lumbar with the external circumflex, and of the comes nervi ischiadic! ■with the arteries in the ham. The principal agents in cai-rying on the collateral circulation after ligature of the super- ficial femoral artery are, according to Sir A. Cooper, as follows.* 'The arteria profunda formed the new channel for the blood.' ' The first artery sent off passed down close to the back of the thigh bone, and entered the two superior articular ■branches of the popliteal artery.' 'The second new large vessel arising from the profunda at the same part with the former, passed down by the inner side of the Biceps muscle, to an artery of the popliteal which was distributed to the Gastrocnemius muscle; whilst a third artery dividing into several branches passed down with the sciatic nerve behind the knee-joint, and some of its branches united themselves with the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal, with some recurrent ■branches of those arteries, with arteries passing to the Gastrocnemii, and, lastly, with the origin of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.' ' It appears then that it is those branches of the profunda which accompany the sciatic nerve that are the principal supporters of the new circulation.' In Porta'a work t (Tab. xii. xiii.) is a good representation of the collateral circulation after the ligature of the femoral artery. The patient had survived the operation three years. The lower part of the artery is, at least, as large as the upper; about two inches of tlie vessel appear to have been obliterated. The external and internal circumflex arteries are seen anastomosing by a great number of branches with the lower branches of the femoral (mus- * Med.-Chir.

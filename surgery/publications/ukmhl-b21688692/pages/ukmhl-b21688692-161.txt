The anterior superior, thin and pointed, corresponx3s with that portion of the skull -which in the foetus is membranous, and is called the anterior fontanelie. The antenor inferior angle is thin and lengthened, being received in the interval be- tween the great wing of the sphenoid and the frontal. This point will be found about one inch behind the upper and outer angle of the orbit. Its inner surface is marked by a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. The posterior superior angle corresponds with the junctioji of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. In the foetus this part of the skull is membranous, and is called the posterior fontanelie. The posterior inferior angle articulates with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and generally presents on its inner surface a broad shallow groove for lodging part of the lateral sinus. Development. The parietal bone is formed in membrane, being developed by one centre, which corresponds with the parietal eminence, and makes its first appearance about the fifth or sixth week of foetal life. Ossification gradually extends from the centre to the circumference of the bone : the angles are consequently the parts last formed, and it is in their situation, that the fontanelles exist, previous to the com- pletion of the growth of the bone. Artmilutions. With five bones: the opposite parietal, the occipital, frontal, temporal, aud sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles. One only, the Temporal.

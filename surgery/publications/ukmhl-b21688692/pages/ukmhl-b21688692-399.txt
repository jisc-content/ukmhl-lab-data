ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. 263 Immerus This tendon consists of two laminas, placed one in front of tlie other, and usually blended togetlior below. The anterior, the thicker, receives the cla- vicular and upper half of the sternal portion of the muscle ; the posterior lamina receiviuo- the attachment of the lower half of the sternal portion. From this arrangement it results, that the fibres of the upper and middle portions of the muscle are inserted into the lower part of the bicipital ridge ; those of the lower portion, into the upper part. The tendon, at its insertion, is connected with that of the Deltoid ; it sends up an expansion over the bicipital groove towards the head of 169.—Muscles of the Chest and Fr.iut of the Arm.

SECRETING GLANDS. ci • extremity, we have a compound racemose gland consisting of a single lobule terminating in its duct (such as Brunner's glands), and an aggrega- tion of such lobules may all open into a common duct, or may have a great number of separate ducts. Instances of such glands will be found m the salivary glands, the pancreas, &c. Or the necessary extent of epithelial ' sui'face may be obtained by the duct being coiled on itself, as m the ; sweat-glands (Fig. XXXIX. p. xc), or the extremity of the duct only may be thus arranged (see the figure of the testis, p. 713) • In other glands, as iu the kidney, the mucous duct is undivided from the beginning, and the y capiUaries from which the secretion is to be eliminated are distributed ! upon its waUs or project into its ampullated commencement (Fig. 377, p. 692). For the description of the Ductless or Blood Glands, Ave must refer to , the sections in the text relating to the Anatomy of the Spleen, Suprarenal j Capsules, Thyroid, and Thymus.

THE SKELETON. 38 The Pteriigoid processes (nrefwl, a loiwj ; tih,<:, Ukmess), (fig. 36), one on each side, descend perpendicularly fmni the point where the body and great wmg unite. Each process consists of an external and an internal plate, sepa- rated behind by an inter- vening notch,—the pterygoid 36.—Sphenoid Bone. Posterior Surface, fossa; but joined partially in front. The cxlernal pterygoid plate is broad and thin, turned- a little outwards, and forms part of the inner wall of the zygomatic fossa. It gives at- tachment, by its «uter sur- face, to the External ptery- goid ; its inner surface forms part of the pterygoid fossa, iand gives attachment to the Internal pterygoid. The in. ternal pterygoid plate is muph narrower and longer, curving outwijurds, at its extremity, into a hook-like process of m 1 bone the hamular process, around which turns the tendon of the Tensor palati muscle At the b*se of this plate is a small, oval, shallow depression, the scaphoid fossa from which arises the Tensor palati, and above which is seen the posterior orifice of the Vidian canal. The outer surface of this plate forms part ot the pterygoid fossa, the inner surface forming the outer boundary of t^e posterior aperture of the nares. The Superior Constrictor of the phai^nx is attached to ite posterior edge. The two pterygoid plates are separated below ^7 interval, in which the pterygoid process, or tuberosity, of the P-^^t^J^^^;^^^ received. The anterior surface of the pterygoid process is very broad at its base, and forms the posterior wall of the «pl^-°--^-|,"^^'y/j^f-^.^^^"^^^^ Meckers ganglion. It presents, above, the anterior orifice of the Vidian cana Td below! a Lgh margin, which articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ^""'th^e'^henoidal Spongy Sones are two thin curved plates of bone, -^^fj^^ .s separafe pieces until puberty, and occasionally are not joined U> he spheno d r. the adult They are situated at the anterior and mferior part of the body ot tne tphendd an aperture of variable si^e being left in their anterior wa 1, tough v^th he sphenoidal sinuses open inte the nasalfoss..

Development. The sphenoid bone is developed by ten centres, six for the pos- terior sphenoidal division, and four for the anterior sphenoid. The six centres for the posterior sphenoid are—one for each greater wing and external pterygoid plate; one for each internal pterygoid plate ; two for the posterior part of the body. Ihc four for the anterior sphenoid nrfi. one for each lesser wing and anterior part of the body, and one for each sphenoi- dal turbinated bone.

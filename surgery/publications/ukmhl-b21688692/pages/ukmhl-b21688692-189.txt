The anterior border forms, the posterior boundary of the spheno-palatine foramen 1 he posterior border, seiTated at the expense of the outer table, articulates with tbe inner surface of the pterygoid process. u a The orbital and sphenoidal processes are separated from one. another by a deep notch which is converted into a foramen, the spheno-palatine,, by articulation with the sphenoidal turbinated bone. Sometimes the two processes, are united above, and form between them a complete foramen, or the notcli ia crossed by one or more spicula of bone, so as to form two or more foramina. In the articulated skull, this foramen opens into the back part of the outer wall of the superior meatus, and transmits the spheno-palatine vessels and nerves. Development. From a single centre, which makes its appearance at the angle of junction of the two plates of the bone. From this point ossification spreads^ in- wards to the horizontal plate, downwards into the tuberosity, and upwards into the vertical plate. In the foetus, the horizontal plate is much longer than the vertical; and even after it is fully ossified, the whole bone is at first remarkable for its shortness. - . . Articulations. With six bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, in- ferior turbinated, vomer, ai?^d opposite palate. Attachment of Muscles. The Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae, Intern?,! and External pterygoid, and Superior constrictor of the pharynx. The Inferior Tdrbtnated Bojtbs, The Inferior Turhinated Bones are situated one on each side of the outer wall of the nasal fossse. Each consists of a layer of thin spongy bone, curled upon itself like a scroll, hence its uarno ' turbinated ;' and extends horizontally along the outer wall of the nasal fossa, immediately below the orifice of the antrum. Each bone presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The internal surface (fig. 53) is convex, perforated by numerous apertures, and traversed by longitudinal grooves and canals for the lodgment of arfcferies and veins. In the recent state it is covered by the lining membrane of the nose. The external surface is concave (fig. 54), and forms part of the inferior meatus. Its upper border is thin, iiTegular, and connected to various bones along the outer wall of the nose. It may be divided into three portions ; of these, the anterior articulates with the inferior turbinated crest of the superior maxillary bone; the posterior with the inferior turbinated crest of the palate bone; the middle portion of the superior border presents three well-marked processes, which vary much in their size and form. Of these the anterior and smallest is situated at the junction of the anterior fourth with the posterior three-fourths of the bono; it is small and pointed, and is called the lachrymal process, for it articulates with

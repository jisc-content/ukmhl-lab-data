The ligaments connecting the various parts of the cartilage together are also two in number. Of these, one is a strong fibrous band, stretching across from the tragus to the commencement of the helix, completing the meatus in front, and partly encircling the boundary of the concha; the other extends between the concha and the jirocessus caudatus. The muscles of tho -pinna (fig. 310), like the ligaments, consist of two sets: I. Those which connect it with the side of the head, moving the pinna as a whole, viz., tho AttoUens, Attrahens, and llotrahens aurem (p. 209) ; and 2. the proper ^lo.—The Muscles of the Pinna. miiscles of the pinna, which extend from one part of the auricle to another. These are, the Helicis major. Antitragicus. Helicis minor. Transversus auriculee. Tragicus. ObHqnus auris. The Uelicis major is a narrow, vertical band of muscular fibres, situated upon the anterior margin of the helix. It arises, below, from the tubercle of the helix, and is inserted into the anterior border of the heUx, just where it is about to curve backwards. It is pretty constant in its existence. The Eelwis minor is an oblique fasciculus, attached to that part of the helix which commences from the bottom of the concha. The Tragicus is a short, flattened band of muscular fibres situated upon the outer surface of the tragus, the direction of its fibres being vertical. The ■ Antitragicus arises from the outer part of the autitragus; its fibres are in- serted into the processus caudatus of the helix. This muscle is usually very distmct. The Transversus auricula} is placed on the cranial surface of the puma. It consists of radiating fibres, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the convexity of the concha to tho prominence corresponding with the groove of the helix.

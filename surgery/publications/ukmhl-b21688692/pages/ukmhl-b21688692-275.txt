INTERNAL CUNEIFOEM. 139 below the ai-ticalai* surface is a rough depression, for the attachment of tho deep portion of the internal lateral ligament. The external surface presents a large triangulai' facet, concave fi-om above downwards, for articulation with the external malleolus; it is continuous above with the trochlear surface; and in front of it is a rough depression for the attachment of the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. The anterior surface, convex and rounded, forms the head of the astragalus; it is smooth, of an oval form, and directed obliquely inwards and downwai'ds ; it is continuous below with that jsart of the anterior facet on the under sm'face which rests upon the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The head is surrounded by a constricted portion, the neck of the astragalus. The posterior surface is narrow, and traversed by a groove, which runs obliquely downwards and inwai'ds, and transmits the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis, external to which is a horizontal notch or depression, in which the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament is lodged. To ascertain to which foot it belongs, hold the bone with the broad articular surface upwards, and the rounded head forwards ; the lateral triangular articular surface for the external malleolus will then point to the side to which the bone belongs. Artmilations. With four bones: tibia, fibula, os calcis, and scaphoid. The Scaphoid. The Scaplwid ov Navicular bone, so called from its fancied resemblance to a boat IS situated at the inner side of the tarsus, between the astragalus behind and the tliree cuneiform bones in front. This bone may be distinguished by its form being concave behind, convex and subdivided into three facets in front. ' The anteiior surface, of an oblong form, is convex from side to side and sub- divided by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the thi-ee 'cuneiform : bones. The posterior surface is oval, concave, broader externally than intemallv and articulates with the rounded head of the astragalus. The superior surface is convex from side to side, and rough for the attachment of ligaments. The inferior IS somewhat concave, irregular, and also rough for the attachment of ligaments ihB mte^-nal smface presents a rounded tubercular eminence, the tuberosity of the ; scaphoid, which gives attachment to part of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus ^}ie external surfa^ is broad, rough, and ii^egular, for the attachment of li^a- i ruboiTw^^'^^^i^^^lly presents a smaU facet for articulation with fhe ■ sJl^'ZitVr^fJ""' '^'T^' ^^''^ ^^^^ articular surface ba^ckwards and the convex dorsal surface upwards; the broad external surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs Articulations.

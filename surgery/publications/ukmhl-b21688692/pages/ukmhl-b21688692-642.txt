CRANIAL NERVES. 5o6 pyramidal aud oHvaiy bodies, in a continuous line wifcli the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. According to Stilling, these roots may be traced to a grey nucleus m the floor of the motlulla oblongata, between the posterior median furrow and the nuclei of the glosso-pliaryngcal and vagus nerves. Tlie filaments of this nerve are collected into two bundles, which perforate the dura mater separately, 276.â€”Hypoglossal Nerve, Cervical Plexus, and their Branches. opposite the anterior condyloid foramen, and unite together after their passage through it. In those cases in which the anterior condyloid foramen in the occi- pital bone is double, these two portions of the nerve are separated by a small piece of bone, which divides the foramen. The nerve descends almost vertically to a point corresponding with the angle of the jaw. It is at first deeply seated beneath the internal carotid and internal jugular vein, and intimately connected with the pneuniogastric nerve ; it then passes forwards between the vein and artery, and at a lower part of the neck becomes superficial below the Digastric muscle. The nerve then loops round the occipital artery, and crosses the external carotid below the tendon of the Digastric muscle. It passes beneath the Mylo- hyoid muscle, lying between it aaid the Hyo-glossus,. and is connected at the anterior border of the latter muscle with the gustatory nerve ; it is tlien continued forwards into the Genio-hyo-glossua, muscle as far sra the tip of the tongue, dis- tributing branches to its substance.

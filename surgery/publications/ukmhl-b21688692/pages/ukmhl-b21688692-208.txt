72 THE SKELETON. orbital foramen, infraorbital canal, anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, malar foramina, and lachrymal canal. To these may be added the external orbital fora- mina, when present. The "Nasal Foss;e. The Nascd Fossce are two large irregular cavities, situated in the middle line of the face, extending from the base of the cranium to the roof of the mouth, and separated from each other by a thin vertical septuni. They communicate by two laro-e apertures, the anterior nares, with the front of the face; and with the pha- rynx behind by the two posterior nares. These fossa3 are much nai-rower above than below, and in the middle than at the anterior or posterior openings: their depth, which is considerable, is much greater in the middle than at either extremity. Each nasal fossa communicates with four sinuses, the frontal above, the sphenoidal behind, and the maxillary and ethmoidal on either side. Each fossa also commu- nicates with four cavities : with the orbit by the lachrymal canal, with the mouth by the anterior palatine canal, with the cranium by the olfactory foramina, and 66,—Eoof, Floor, and Outer.

J;*""^^ entering into their formation are fourteen in number : ^'^'^^^ ^^^^^^'^^^ frontal, sphenoid, find ethmoid, and all the bones of the face, excepting the malar and lower jaw. Each cavity is bounded by a roof, a floor, an inner and an outor wall. The uvper wall, or roof (fig. 66), is long, narrow, and concave from before back- wards -, it is formed in front by the nasal bones and nasal spme of the .rental, wlncii are directed downwards and forwards ; in the middle, by the cnbnforni lamella of the ethmoid, which is horizontal; and behind, by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and sphenoidal turbinated iK.nos, which are dn-ccted downwards and backwards. This surface presents, from before ba<3kwards, the mternal aspect the nasal bones ; on their outer side, the suture formed between the -^^^^ bo°« ^J'^ tTie nasal process of the superior maxillary ; on their inner side the elevated crest which receives the nasal spine of the frontal, and the perpendicular plate of the

It presents at first a large central canal, which gradually contracts, and in after life is no longer per- ceptible to the eye, though it is still visible on microscopic sections (v. p. Ixxiii). After the fourth month the spinal column begins to grow in length more rapidly than the medulla, so that the latter no longer occupies the whole canal. The ganglia and auterior roots of the nerves are perceptible at the fourth week, the posterior roots at the sixth. The cord is com- posed at first entirely of uniform-looking cells, which soon separate into two layers, the inner of which forms the epithelium of the central canal, while the outer forms the central grey substance of the cord. The white columns are formed later; their rudiments can be detected about the fourth week.

The ganglia appear to be developed from the protovertebral discs, and it is possible that the pos- terior roots also are ; the anterior roots proceed from the mediil a itself.

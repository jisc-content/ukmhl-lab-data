E.\ternal to the articular processes are the four posterior sacral foramina ; they are smaller in size and less regular in form than the anterior, and transmit the posterior branches of the sacral nerves. On the outer side of the posterior sacral foramina is a series of tubercles, the rudimentary l5 _y:icnini, P.>:-'lui-iiiv Huvl'iU'i'. posterior trav^sverse processes of the sacral yertebrsB. The first pair of tmnsverse tubercles are of large size, very distinct, and correspond with each superior angle of the bone the se^nd, ;mall in size, enter into the formation of the sacro-ihac articulation the third give attachment to the obhque fascicuh of the posterior sacro- iliac ligaments ; and the fourth and fifth to the great sacro-sciatic ligaments. The inter pace between the spinous and transverse processes on the back of the sacrum, presents a wide shallow concavity, called the sacral groove ; it is continuous above lith the vertebral groove, and lodges the origin of the Erector spin^.

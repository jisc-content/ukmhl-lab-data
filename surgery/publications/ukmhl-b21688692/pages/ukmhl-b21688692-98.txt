xciv GENERAL ANATOMY. The nails, in structure, consist of cells having a laminated arrangement, and these are essentially similar to those composing the epidermis. The deepest layer of cells which lie in contact with the papiUaj at the root and under surface of the nail, are of elongated form, an-anged perpendicularly to the surface, and provided with nuclei; those which succeed these are of a rounded or polygonal form, the more superficial ones becoming broad, thin, and flattened, and so closely compacted together as to make the limits of each cell very indistinct. It is by the successive growth of new cells at the root and under surface of the body of the nail, that it advances forwards, and maintains a due thickness, whilst, at the same time, the growth of the nail m the proper direction is secured. As these ceUs in their turn become displaced by the oTowth of new cells, they assume a flattened form, lose their nuclei, and finally become closely compacted together into a firm, dense, horny texture. In chemical composition, the nails resemble the epidermis. Accordmg to Mulder, they contain a somewhat larger porportion of carbon and sulphur. . . , The Hairs are peculiar modifications of the epidermis, and consist essentially of the same structure as that membrane. They are ^onni^ nearly every part of the surface of the body, excepting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and vary much in length, thickness and colour in different parts of the body and in different races of mankmd. In some parts they are so short as not to project beyond the foUicles contannng them : in other parts, as upon the scalp, they are of considerable length ; along the margin of the eyelids and upon the face, they are remarkab e for their thickness. A hair consists of a root, the part implanted m the skin; the shaft, the portion projecting from its surface, and the pomt. They generally present a cylindrical or more or less flattened form, and a reniform outline upon a transverse section. The root of the hair presents at its extremity a bulbous enlargement, ^hichis whiter in colour, and softer in texture, than the Â«tem, and is Todced in a follicular involution of the epidermis, called the ha^r.foll^cle. When the hair is of considerable length, the follicle extends into the sub- ItaneousceUulartissue. The halr-foUicle is bulbous a its d^^^^^^^ like the hair which it contains, and has opening into it, near its tree etiWy 1 orifices of the ducts of one or more sebaceous glands.

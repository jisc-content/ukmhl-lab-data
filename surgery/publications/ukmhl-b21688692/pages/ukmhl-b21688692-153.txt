The borders of the coccyx are narrow, and give attachment on each ,side totte sacro-sciatic Hgaments and Coccygeus muscle. The base presents an oval surface for articulation with the sacrum. The apex is rounded, and has attached to it the tendon of the external Sphincter muscle. It is occasionally bifad, and sometimes deflected to one or other side. _ Development. The coccyx is developed by fmir centres, one for each piece. Occasionally, one of the first three pieces of this bone is developed by two centres, placed side by side. The ossific nuclei make their appearance m the following order • in the first segment, at birth ; in the second piece, at from five to ten years ; in the third, from ten to fifteen years ; in the fourth, from fifteen to twenty years. As age advances, these various segments become united in the following order: the first two pieces join ; then the third and fourth; and, lastly, the bone is com- pleted by the union of the second and third. At a late period of life, especially in females, the coccyx often becomes joined to the end of the sacrum. Articulation. With the sacrum. Attachment of Muscles. On either side, the Coccygeus ; behind, the Gluteus maximus, and Extensor coccygis, when present; at the apex, the Sphincter ani ; and in front, the Levator ani.- Op the Spine in general. The spinal column, formed by the junction of the vertebriB, is situated in the median hue, at the posterior part of the trunk : its average length is about two feet two or three inches, measured along the curved anterior surface of the column. Of this length the cervical part measures alaout five, the dorsal about eleven, the lumbar about seven inches, and the sacrum and coccyx the remainder. Viewed in front, it presents two pyramids joined together at their bases, the upper one being formed by all the vertebraa from the second cervical to the last lumbar ; the lower one by the sacrum and coccyx. When examined more closely, the upper pyramid is seen to be formed of three smaller pyramids. The upper- most of these consists of the six lower cervical vertebrae ; its apex being formed by the axis or second cei-vical; its base, by the first dorsal. The second pyramid, which is inverted, is formed by the four upper dorsal vertebra), the base being at the first dorsal, the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually increases in size to the fifth lumbar. Viewed laterally (fig. 21), the spinal column presents several curves, which cor- respond to the different regions of the column, and are called cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and pehic. The cervical curve commences at the apex of the odontoid process, and terminates at the middle of the second dorsal vertebra ; it is convex in front, and is the least marked of all the curves. The dorsal curve, which is concave forwards, commences at the middle of the second, and- terminates at the 0

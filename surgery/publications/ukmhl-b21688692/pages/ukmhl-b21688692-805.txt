This cartilage is sometimes united to the arytenoid and serves to prolong it backwards a^d inwards.

The epi^-lottis is a thin lamella of fibro-cartilage, of a yellowish colour, shaped like a leaf, and placed behind the tongue in front of the superior opening of the larynx. During respiration, its direction is vertically upwards, its free extremity curving forwards towards the base .of the tongue^ but when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue during deglutition, it is carried downwards and baclcwards, so as to completely close the opening of the larynx. Its free extremity is broad and rounded; its attached end is long and narrow^ and connected to the receding angle between the two alae of the thyroid cartilage, just below the median notch, by a long, narrow, ligamentous band, the .thyro- epiglottic ligament. It is also connected to the posterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone, by an elastic ligamentous band, the hyo-epiglottic ligament. Its anterior or lingual surface is curved forwards ^ towffla?ds the tongue, and covered by mucous membrane, which is reflected on to the sides and base of the organ, forming a median and two lateral folds, the glosso-epiglottklean ligaments. Its posterior or laryngeaZ surface is smooth, concave from side to side, convex from above downwards, and covered by mracous membrane ; when this is I'emoved, the surface of the cartilage is seen to be studded with a number of small mucous glands, which are lodged in little pits upon its surface. To its sides the aryteno- epiglottidean folds are attached. Structure. The epiglottis, cuneiform cartilages, and cornicula laryngis are composed of yellow cartilage, which shows little tendency to ossification ; but the other cartilages resemble in structure the costal cartilagesi, becoming more or less ossified in old age. Ligaments. The ligaments of the larynx are extrinsic, i.e. those connecting the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides; and intrinsic^ those which connect the several cartilaginous segmemts io each other. The ligaments connecting the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides are three in number : the thyro-hyoid membrane, and the two lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments. The thyro-hyoid membrane is a broad, fibro-elastic, membranous layer, attached

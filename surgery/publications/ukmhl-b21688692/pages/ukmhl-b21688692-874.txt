73B SURGICAL ANATOMY Oi*' FEMORAL HKRNJA. found on the inner nido of fclic internal saphenous vein, tlic terminal branch of tlie gcnito-erunil nerve outwide Lhe vein, and the middle and external cutaneous nerves more external. The deep layer of sujjerlicial fascia should be divided in the same direction as the external incisions, and separated from the fascia lata; this is easily eliected from its extreme thinness. It is a thin but dense membrane, placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and upon the surface of the ftiscia lata. It i.s intimately adherent above to the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, and about cue inch below this ligament covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, is 401.—reniond llurnia, allowing Fascia Liita aud Saphenous Openiii^j. closely tinitecl to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoial vessels corresponding to its under surface. The portion of fasca covering this rerture is peiforated by the internal saphenous vein, aud by numerous blood and tvlbltic vessels ; hence it has been termed the cnbriform fa.aa the opemngs of'hese vessS ha;ing been likened to the holes in a sieve. The cnbnform fascia adhe close y both to the superficial fascia and the flvscia lata, so that rt is descrd^ed W some anatomists as a part of the fascia lata, but is usually considcTed (as a this wCk) as belonging t^ the superficial fascia. It is not till the cribriform ia.cia has b"en clared aw.ay, fhat the saphenous opening is seen so that tins opening does not in ordinary cases, exist naturally, but is the result of dissection. Mr. Callondcr r ICr sietks o^ cases in which, probably as the result of pres.sure irom enlarged ruirauCds S.0 fascia has become atrophied, and a saphenous opening exists. ^Z:^£to^^^ooiio^ A femoral hcrnio,, in passing through the saphenous- opening, receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. • Anatomy of Femoral Rupture, note on p, 18.

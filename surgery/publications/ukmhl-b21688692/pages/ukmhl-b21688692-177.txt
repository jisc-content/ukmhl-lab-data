Inner Surface of Right Lateral Mass (enlarged). numerous grooves, wliioh run nearly vertically downwiirds from tlie cribriform plate: they lodge branches of the olfactory nerve, ■which are distributed on the mucous membrane covering the bone. The back part of this surface is subdivided by a narrow oblique fissure, the superior meatus of the nose, bounded above by a thin curved plate of bone—the sjiperio.r turbinated bone. By means of an orifice at the upper part of this fissure, the posterior ethmoidal cells open into the nose. Below, and in front of the superior meatus is seen the convex surface of the middle turbinated bone. It extends along the whole length of the inner surface of each lateral mass ; its lower margin is ree and thick, and its concavity, directed outwards, assists in formmg the middle meatus. It is by a large orifice at the upper and front part of the middle meatus, that the anterior ethmoidal cells, and through them the frontal _ sinuses com- municate with the nose, by means of a funnel-shaped canal, the infundibulum. The cellular cavities of each lateral mass, thus walled in by the os planum on the outer side, and by the other bones already mentioned, are divided by a thm transverse bony partition into two sets, which do not communicate with each other; they are termed the anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells, or sinuses. The former, more numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses above, and the middle meatus below, by means of a long flexuous cellular canal, the inftuHlibulum; the posterior, less nnmerous,_ open into the superior meatus, and communicate (occasionally) with the sphenoidal sinuses, Bevelopment. By three centres : one for the perpendicular lamella, and one for each lateral mass. The lateral masses are first developed, ossific granules making their first appearance in the os planum between the fourth and fifth months of foetal life, and afterwards iu the spongy bones. At birth, the bone consists of the two lateral masses, which are small and ill-developed ; but when the perpendicular and horizontal plates begin to ossify, as they do about the first year after birth, the lateral masses become joined to the cribriform plate. The formation and increase in the ethmoidal cells, which complete the bone, take place about the fifth or sixth year. Articulations. With fifteen bones : the sphenoid, two sphenoidal turbinated, the frontal, and eleven of the face—the two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachry- mal, two palate, two iiiferipr turbinated, and tlie vomer. Development op the Chanium. The development of the r-rnnium commences at a very early pel'iotl, on accoinit of tlio importance of tjie orfran it is intended to protect. In its most rudimentary state, it con- sists of a thin niembrnnous capsule, cnclDsnig the cerebrum, and accurately "moulded upon Its surface. This capsule is placed external to the dura mater, and in close cOnfatct with it; Its walls lire continuous with the canal for the spinal cord, and the chorda dorsnlis, of primitive purt of the vet<!l)rnl colunni, is continued forwards, from the spine, along the bas(', to Its fore part, wliere it terminalps in a tapering point. The next stop in tlie process of development is the formation of cartilage. This is deposited in the base of the skull,

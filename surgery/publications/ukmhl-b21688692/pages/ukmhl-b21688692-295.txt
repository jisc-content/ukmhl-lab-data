TEMPORO-MAXILLARY. 159 of the condyles of tlie occipital bone. In .the triangalar interval left between these ligaments and the mavgiu of the foramen magnum, a third strong ligamentous band (ligamentum suspensorium) may be seen, which passes almost perpendicularly from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen, being intimately blended with the anterior occipito-atloid ligament, and upper fasciculus of the transverse ligament of the atlas. Actions. The odontoid ligaments serve to limit the extent to which rotation of the cranium may be carried; hence they have received the name of checJc- ligaments. Y. Temporo-Maxillart Articulation. This is an arthrodial joint; the parts entering into its formation are, on each side, the anterior part of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone and the eminentia articularis above; with the condyle of the lower jaw below. The ligaments are the following: External Lateral. Stylo-maxillary. Infernal Lateral. Capsular. Interarticular Fibre-cartilage. The External Lateral Ligament (fig. 121) is a short, thin, and naiTOw fasci- • cuius attached above to the outer surface of the zygoma and to the rough tnbercle on its lower border; below, to the outer surface and posterior border of the neck 121.- -Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.

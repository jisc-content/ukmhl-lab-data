The two layers are separated by a thin membrane, the deep plantar fascia, on the vemoviil of which is seen the tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum, the Flexor acces- sorius, the tendon of the Flexor longus pol- licis, and the Lumbricales. The long flexor tendons cross each other at an acute angle, the Flexor longus pollicis running along the inner side of the foot, on a plane superior to that of the Flexor longus digitorum, the direction of which is obliquely outwards. Second Layer. ■ Flexor Accessorius. Lumbricales. The Flexor Accessorius arises by two heads : the inner or larger, which is mnscular, being attached to the inner concave surface of the os calcis, and to the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament; the outer head, flat and tendinous, to the nnder surface of the os calcis, m front of its outer tubercle, and to the long plantar ligament: the two porljions join at an acute angle, and are in- serted into the outer margin and upper and under surfaces of the tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum, forming a kind of groove, in which the tendon is lodged. It is supplied by the ex- ternal plantar nerve. Belatims.

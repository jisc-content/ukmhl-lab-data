Inferior Tibio-Fibular Articulation. This articulation is formed by the rough convex surface ofJhe inner side of t^olwei end of the fibula, connected with a similar rough suiface on he outer thelowoi end o ^^^^ ^^^^^ two lines, these surfaces are ^mLth Ind 'Covered with' cartilage, which is continuous with that of the ankle- joint The ligaments of this joint are— " Inferior Interosseous. Posterior Inferior Tibio-Pibular. Anterior Inferior Tibio-Fibular. Transverse. The Inferior Interosseous Ligament consists of numerous short strong fibrous bands, which pass between the contiguous rough surfaces of the txbia and fibula, and constitute the chief bond of union between the bones. This hgament is con- tinuous above, with the interosseous membrane. . ^ nu S Interior Inferior Ligament (fig. 144) is a flat, triangular band of fibre^ broader below than above, which extends obliquely downwards and outwa ds between the adjacent margins of the tibia and fibula on the front aspect of the artiirtion li is in relatln, in front, with the Peroneus tertius, the aponeurosis of the leg, and the integument; behind, with the inferior interosseous ligament; and lies in contact with the cartilage covering the astragalus _ The Posterior Inferior Ligament, smaller than the preceding, is disposed m a similar manner on the posterior surfate of the articulation. S:et3™™« lining tbe articular .nrface is derived fron. of the '""IS*: The movement permitted in these articnlations is limited to a very sKght gUding of the articular surfaces one npon another. IV.

The Posterior or Internal Grucial Ligament is larger in size, but less oblique in its direction than the anterior. It is attached to the back part of the depression behind the spine of the tibia to the popliteal notch, and to the posterior extremity of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage ; and passes upwards, forwards, and in- wards, to be inserted into the outer and fore-part of the inner condyle of the femur. As it crosses the anterior crucial ligament, a fasciculus is given off from it, which blends with the posterior part of that ligament. It is in relation, in front, with the anterior crucial ligament; behind, with the ligamentum posticum Winslowii. The Semilunar Fibro-Gartilages (fig. 142) are two CTescentic lamellae, which are attached to the margins of the head of the tibia, and serve to deepen its surface for articulation with the condyles of the femur.

Their upper surfaces are concave, and in relation with the condyles of the femur; their lower sur- faces are flat, and rest upon the head of the tibia. Each cartilage covers nearly the outer two-thirds of the corresponding articular surface of the tibia, leav- ing the inner third unco- vered ; both surfaces are smooth, and invested by synovial membrane. The Internal Semihmar Fihro-Cartilage is nearly semicircular in form, a little elongated from before backwards, and broader behind than in front; its convex border is united to the internal lateral ligament, and to the head of the tibia, by means of the coronary ligaments; its anterior extremity, thin and pointed, is firmly implanted into a depression in front of the inner articular surface of the tibia; its posterior extremity into the depression behind the spine, between the attachment of the external cartilage and posterior crucial ligament. The External Semihmar Fibro-Cartilage forms nearly an entire circle, covering a larger portion of the articular surface than the internal one. It is grooved on its outer side, for the tendon of the Popliteus muscle. Its circumference is held in connection with the head of the tibia, by means of the coronary ligaments ; and its two extremities are firmly implanted in the depressions in front and behind the spine of the tibia. These extremities, at their insertion, are interposed between the attachments of the internal cartilage. The external semilunar fibro-cartilage gives ofi from Its anterior border a fasciculus, which forms the transverse ligament By ^ts anterior extremity, it is continuous with the anterior crucial ligament.

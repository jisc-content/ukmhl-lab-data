THE SKETiETON. 48 anterior palatine fossa. In some bones, a delicate linear suture may be seen ex- teudincr from the anterior palatine fossa to the interval betsveeu the lateral mcisor and the canine tooth. This marks out the intermaxillary, or incisive bone, winch in some animals exists permanently as a separate piece It includes the whole thickness of the alveolus, the corresponding part of the floor of the nose and the anterior nasal spine, and contains the sockets of the incxsor teeth, rhe outer border of the palate process is incorporated w.th the rest of the bone. The innei border is thicker in fi-ont than behind, and is x-aised above mto a ridge, which, with the corresponding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a groove ^he receptK.n of the vomer. The anterior margin is bounded by the thin concave bordei of the opening of the nose, prolmiged forwards internally mto a sharp process, forming, with a similar process of the • nr -u n opposite bone, Janterio,- nasal *7-^"'^^^} tfSXl^^'""' " spine. The posterior border^ is serrated for articulation with the h,orizon-tal plate of the palate- bone. Development. This bono is formed at sueh an early period, and ossilicatioQ proceeds in it with such rapidity, that it has- been found impracticable hitherto to determine with accuracy its number of centres. It appears, however,, pi'obable that it has four centres of developoient, viz., one for the nasal and facial por- tions, one for the orbital and malar, one for the incisive, and one for the palatal portion, in- cluding the entire palate except the incisive segment. The inci- sive- portion is indicated in young bones by a fissure, which marks off a. small segment of the palate, including the two incisor teeth / for IfataZ ^ Faeinl ^orfVi 1 for- Orlttal Mctlnr jtortV Anterior Surface. at Birth I farIntisiDC jtorf^ I fo, PalaiaT iiorf^ Inffriof Surfirrf. including tue wo .......

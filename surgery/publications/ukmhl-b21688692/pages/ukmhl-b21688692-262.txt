In the upper end (fig. 105), they run parallel columns a a from the summit of the head To the thick under wall of the neck while a series of transverse fibres h b cross the parallel columns and «t them to the thin upper wall of the neck. Ajiother series of plates cc springs from the whole interior of the cyUnder above the lesser trochanter; these pass upwards and converge to form a series of arches Lneath the'upper wall of the neck near its iunction with the great troclmider.

534 SPINAL NERVES. arises from the inner cord, with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves. It passes through the axillary space, at first lying behind, and then on the inner side of the axillary vein, and communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve. It then descends alon- the inner side of the braclnal artery, to the middle of the arm, where it pierces the deep fascia, and is distributed to tlie integument of the back part of the lower third of the arm, extending as far as the elbow, where some filaments are lost in the integuments in front of the inner condyle, and others over the ole- cranon It communicates with the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve. In some cases the nerve of Wrisborg and intercosto-humeral are connected W two or three filaments, which form a plexus at the back part of the axilla. In other cases, the intercosto-humeral is of large size, and takes the place of the nerve of Wrisberg, receiving merely a filament of communication from the brachial plexus, which represents the latter nerve. In other cases, this filament is wanting, the place of the nerve of Wrisberg being supplied entirely from the intercosto-humeral. The Median Nerve (fig. 285) has received its name from the course it takes along the middle of the arm and fore-arm to the hand, lying between the ulnar and the musculo-spiral and radial nerves. It arises by two roots, one from the outer, and one from the inner cord of the brachial plexus ; these embrace the lower part of the axillary artery, uniting either in front or on the outer side of that vessel. As it descends through the arm, it lies at first on the outer side of the brachial artery, crosses that vessel in the middle of its course, usually in front, but occasionally behind it, and lies on its inner side to the bend of the elbow, where it is placed heneath the bicipital fascia, and is separated from the elbow-jomt by the Brachialis anticus. In the fore-arm, it passes between the two heads ot the Pronator radii teres, and descends beneath the Flexor sublimis, to within two inches above the annular ligament, where it becomes more superficial, lying be- tween the Flexor subUmis and Flexor carpi radialis, beneath, or rather to the ulnar side of, the tendon of the Palmaris longus, covered by the integument and fascia. It then passes beneath the annular Hgament into the hand. _ Brandies. No branches are given ofi" from the median nerve in the arm. In the fore.arm its branches are, muscular, anterior interosseous, and palmar cp_taneous_ The musciaar branches supply all the superficial muscles on the front of the fore-arm except the Flexor carpi ulnaris. These branches are derived from the nerveTe'ar the elbow.

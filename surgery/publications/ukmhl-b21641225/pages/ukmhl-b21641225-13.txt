This upper blade, to admit of operating, unlike the lower one, is but a skeleton, leaving all the centre of the lid and its margin, on the outer side, exposed (Fig. 451). AVith a scalpel, two incisions are made along the margin of the lid, one on each side of the row of eyelashes, carefully including all of them; the knife, for both incisions, being held in the direction of the growth of the lashes and made to cut deeply. The ends of the incision are curved into each other, and then the piece of skin, &c, including the lashes, is detached altogether with scalpel and forceps. The inner of the two horizontal incisions is the important one. It must be made, with a firin hand, within every ingrow- ing eyelash, but in a regular curve, so as not to make an irregular edge to the lid. This incision often carries away with it a longi- tudinal strip of the cartilage, which gives shape to the lid. It should not trench on the conjunctiva or on that aspect of the lid. Then, if any of the bulbs have been cut through and are left, they should be removed : they are easily seen in the wound as little dark points.

Or it may even .be necessary to enlarge the palpebral aperture at the outer canthus, or to evacuate some of the fluid contents of the eye. After the four rectus tendons have been divided in this operation, the removal of the globe should be completed as quickly as may be, to prevent, loss of blood, or its being extensively effused in the orbital and palpebral areolar tissue ; for, if th4rluttc.11 .fy^fc"^ take* place, it is so much the more difficult to reach the deeper surrounding parts to divide them, and the wound is longer in healing, and tire lids of the patient are for so much the longer time discoloured afterwards: /vHnnrr we > must stop the bleeding as so^ as possible after the globe is removed from the ^ ~~ •~^jorbit.

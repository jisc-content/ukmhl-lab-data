The sclerotic was extremely thin, and the choroid almost pigmentless ; hence the reflection, in the opinion of the surgeon. A small tumour (fibrous, and presenting several cyst- like cavities) was found attached to the posterior surface of the sclerotic and to the sheath of the optic nerve. The measurements approached those of most animals, the lateral diameter (S'") being greater than the antero-posterior (7t"). A coloboma iridis "enabled us to fix the period of gestation in which this arrest of development occurred."â€”Ibid., Aug. 1st, 1870, p. 214. 3

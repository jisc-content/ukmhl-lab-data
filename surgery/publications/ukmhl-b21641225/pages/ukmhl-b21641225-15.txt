Seldom, if the punctum be averted from the globe, will it be enough to restore its right position;.' Whilst disused, it has become permanently too narrow. If it be everted a little, it will "Be enough that the punctum be divided, so that the tears may reach the slit-shaped artificial opening, If-ife-be closed, or too small, it*mist-be slit up ; and if the canaliculus or nasal duet be obstructed, it must^ jije thenceforth repeatedly probed. A.mong the preliminary " special exciting causes " of an overflow of tears, besides grief and casual external stimulants, such as peat-smoke, we must not omit to search for eyelashes, or other foreign bodies, in or upon the conjunc- tiva. ^Tf there be, intolerance of light, there is generally an equal amount of lacrymation when the eyes are exposed to light/; Both are excessive in the J common conjunetivitis of weakly children.

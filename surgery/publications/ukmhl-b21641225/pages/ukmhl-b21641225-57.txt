Finally, by approximating the handles, without any other change of position of the two needles, he makes the rent in the retina. To be sure that this is done, he withdraws now the second needle, and examines the fundus again with the ophthalmoscope himself, to see if the subretinal fluid has entered the vitreous chamber, to see the rent if possible, or some evidence of the success of the operation. If there be none, he re-introduces the second needle, to repeat the operation. THE END. MtAbUCilV, BVAJW, AND CO., PfiUTBBS, WH1TEVUIAB8.

The advantages of the ophthalmoscope, in a surgical point of view, and as an aid in the treatment of eye-diseases generally, have been alluded to (p. 334, et seq.). Fig. 462 represents the way in which I recommend the instrument to be used. The patient rests and steadies his head against a high upright-backed chair. Fig. 402.—Use of the Ophthalmoscope.

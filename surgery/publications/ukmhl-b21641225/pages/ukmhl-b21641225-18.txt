By having these different bends, the end of one of these probes will so much the better find its way and pass along the nasal duct, either unassisted, held loosely in the fingers, or beingJ slightly rotated by the Surgeon as it is pressed downwards^ The patient being" •« £'Oi ». tx seated with the back of his head against the chest of the Surgeon who is stand- ing behind him, the probe is held horizontally in the right hand for the right eye, and vice vcrsd; with one ringer of thaother hand the skin of the lower lid is drawn down and outwards, as in the operation of slitting the canaliculus^ "With another finger, the skin of the same lid is drawn down a little just at the ' ' punctilio, so as thus to evert the lid^and show the orifice by which the probe is c^-t'^n entered, the point of it being kept clown a little, so as to feel the bottom of the "' open mucous channel as it is passed along; and, the parts being stretched sX^^ilm Ljnxbsr- $ same time, it is hardly possible to make a false passage. > The probe is known to be in the sac by the resistance that is felt, and by the' absence of any •..elasticity; and, when the lower lid is no longer kept on the stretch, pressing , the end of the probe inwards towards the nose,'if the probe be in the sac, does not pucker the skin of the parts concerned. If the probe have met with any obstruction in the canaliculus, if it have folded the lining membrane and cannot therefore pass, it should be withdrawn a little and then passed onwards again, the lower lid being always drawn very much down and outwards, so as 7~7j| to make sure that it is in the right direction ; then, by steady pressure, with slight rotation of the probe, the obstruction may be soon overcome ; if not, a smaller and a smaller probe must be used until one is passed. Then the size <y ^1 \ of the probe is noted, and each succeeding time a larger one is attempted to he ' f># passed^ It may be well, perhaps, to leave it in a short time when it is passed ^llSsi^J through a stricture^/fhrCA►»&»4-ltf{<U)*<U>* K -V The probe, ha^urg been introduced into'the lacrymal sac, has yet to be .

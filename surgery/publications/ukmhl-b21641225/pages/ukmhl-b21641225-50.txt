It is also, in different cases, sometimes useful in other operations for cataract, in cases where the old-fashioned open curette would have been used, so as to employ suction-power instead of traction, &c. Whenever a cataract has been removed by flap-extraction or smaller corneal section, and soft cortical matter and shreds of lens-capsule remain, less injury to the parts is probably done by use of the suction-curette than by the old curette or other traction instrument; but the latter must be used in many cases when the cortical matter, &c, is not very soft, and the suction-curette becomes clogged. As to the shreds of lens-capsule and lens-matter involved, the grooved curette cannot possibly remove them, and considerable fragments of lens-matter cannot be removed with either the suction or the grooved curette so readily as with a scoop. The grooved curette acted best when, with the first gush of acpieous humour along its groove, the opportunity was taken to let pass along with the aqueous humour as much as possible of the diffluent lens. Now, with the suction- curette there is no voluntary gush along the tube of the instrument when it is introduced, only beside it, perhaps, and the space beside it is not large enough .to let pass any but the smallest fragments that may come in the way; so, not to lose the opportunity given by the natural force of expulsion and the greater quantity of fluid contents,, we must begin to employ the suction-power as soon as possible after we have entered the suction-curette in the anterior chamber, or the aqueous humour without the lens-matter may be running to .waste. Secondary Operations for Cataract.—Opaque matters on the capsule of the lens, remaining after removal of cataract by any one of the various fore- mentioned methods, very often necessitate a final operation ; without which, indeed, the promised good result of the operation—for there has been no iritis in these simple cases—is in abeyance. When it is plain that this little opera- tion will be required, it should be clone as soon as all redness, remaining after the primary and major operation, has disappeared from the eye ; for, if it be long deferred, the capsule becomes so tough that it cannot be torn through without much force, or the use of two needles, and even then, perhaps, a rent insuffi- ciently large is made ; and, moreover, the force used, and the dragging made on the parts around, may light up an inflammation which will after all close the aperture made in the capsule. It is seldom indeed that, with a pupil widely dilated, one cannot see, after removal of the lens, some opaque .patches and streaks left upon the posterior capsule in situ; but these are very often only found in the margin, and there chiefly in most cases where they are generally distributed. Others consist of shrivelled-up remains of the anterior lens-capsule, and of traces of the cataract itself; and yet, although these may be considerable, if they have been drawn away towards the circum- ference with the retracted capsule, as they are usually, ail ways behind the iris, when not under the influence of atropine, they will require no needle-operation. If the central parts be clear, there would seem to be no obstruction to vision, and the patient should have good sight; but, as in doubtful commencing cataract- cases, we have two methods of examination—the ophthalmoscopic mirror, and, if this fail to show us any opacity, or to explain otherwise why vision, with proper spectacles, is still imperfect, oblique illumination, by which, sometimes, such a puckering of the posterior capsule is detected as (without any opacity) to require an opening to be made in it with a needle. By the ordinary needle- operation for these secondary cases, when there is a central obstruction, the opacities are but thrust away and subsequently left to be drawn' aside alto-

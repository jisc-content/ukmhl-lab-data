45 SECONDAEY OPERATIONS FOR CATARACT gether, ami permanently, by the shrivelling of the lacerated capsule, leaving thus the central part free ami unobstructed. The eye is fixed open and steadied by use of the wire speculum and toothed forceps ; or, if one needle only will be wanted to be used, the operator may employ the fingers of his left hand instead of both (see Fig. 455); then he passes into the anterior chamber, through some marginal part of the cornea, wherever it may be most convenient, and not very oblicpiely through the coats, a cataract-needle, the point of which is then brought down towards the capsule, and so far as to reach some way across it to the side opposite to that at which it has been entered: the capsule is then penetrated: and, without passing the instru- ment any further into the eye, the point is carried back, and towards the side at which it has been introduced. The needle should traverse imperceptibly the capsule, but it may have become tough, and b'ffer some resistance ; or, in an old neglected case, although it may be perforated, it is so very tough and elastic that it cannot be torn, without the help of another needle entered on the opposite side of the cornea. And we may not merely regard the opening that is to be made without considering the force used : the operation must be done without any dragging upon the ciliary processes and surrounding parts, or iritis or even ophthalmitis may be set up in the eye. Sometimes after cataract-operation, a fragment of opaque lens-matter, enve- loped in capsule, remains in the pupil : as it is a deformity, but chiefly be- cause it obstructs vision, it must be displaced or removed. With a needle it may be detached at the parts at which it is least firmly attached in the circum- ference, and then it may be pushed aside, and perhaps it will be retracted behind the iris, and remain out of sight, and, as regards the patient, offer no obstruc- tion to vision : it does no harm and may be left there, but, if it remain very loose, sometimes or always appearing in the pupil, and interfering 'with vision, or if in the former needle-operation it seem to be but slightly connected with the surrounding parts, then it may be removed with iris or cannula forceps, introduced by a sufficient opening made in the margin of the cornea with a knife or a broad needle. This may only be done if its attachments be weak ; if they be strong, perhaps they can be cut through first of all with iris or cannula scissors, and the forceps then used. With iris-forceps and iris-scissors we have much more power and certainty than with the cannula instruments ; but for their use we must, of course, have a larger corneal opening. Some- times, and not unfrequently, an opaque band or two are found behind the pupil, after cataract-operation, in the level of the posterior capsule; if one of these be in the way of vision, it may, if recent and not thick, and if it cannot be broken through with a single needle, be twisted and broken by two needles introduced from opposite sides, or divided with scissors : then it will retract and remain out of sight. The twisting operation is somewhat dangerous, by reason of the dragging it may cause upon the ciliary processes, &c. Experience in this and in other eye-operations only will inform us how much force may be used : but if the eye be otherwise useless, some operation must be done at all events, and I think in such cases probably it is best boldly to make a quarter section of the circumference of the cornea with a knife, then to introduce the points of a pair of iris-scissors, having one point blunt to be kept next the cornea, and the other sharp to be thrust within the pupil, behind the band, and so to divide it and leave it in two parts. The cannula instruments, forceps and scissors, are introduced by making for them, with a broad needle, a pre- liminary opening in the margin of the cornea, wherever it may be most convenient, not very obliquely, or in use they will bruise the cornea, and only just sufficiently large so as to retain as much as possible of the aqueous humour,

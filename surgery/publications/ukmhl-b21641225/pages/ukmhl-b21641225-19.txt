Then the f~ e iH^^, muscle regains and retains the power of moving the eye, but in a diminished degree, so as, usually and without any special exertion, to place the eye in a position parallel to that of the other. The first point in diagnosing a fit case for tenotomy in squint cases is to ascertain that all the muscles of the eye act, and that there is no paralysis of any of them. Then, again, an operation should not be performed in any case in which the squint is not confirmed, where some- times there is no degree of squint; in such a case, spectacles should be tried. Convex glasses (for hypermetropia) are very often needed in squint cases to remedy a slight degree, or, at least after the operation, to correct the pre-exist- ing error of refraction. The hypermetropia is the cause why most of the patients who squint have begun to do so at the age at which children have learned to read and observe near objects closely. Very young children are therefore very rarely subjects for squint-operation. And even if the case be one of a confirmed squint, the operation (in a very young child) may be deferred, if the vision of neither eye he impaired. A large majority of these cases are of convergent strabismus, requiring division of the internal rectus tendon or tendons. Of 307 primary operations for squint, at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, in Moorfields, in 1871, 275 were for convergent, and 32 for divergent strabismus. The superior or inferior rectus tendons are very rarely divided. A squint doivnivards is hardly ever seen but in hydro- cephalus, of which it is supposed by some to be pathognomonic ; it is, in these cases, of both eyes, and only occurs at intervals. To ascertain the existence or the degree of squint, the patient is placed standing before the Surgeon, who observes which eye seems to squint. The Surgeon, if, for instance, the patient's right eye be turned inwards in looking at him, extends and closes the fingers of his right hand, bringing them with the back of the hand to the face of the patient, close up before his left eye, without touching it; then, the patient still regarding the face of the Surgeon, the left eye being shut out, the right eye is everted from its former position and turned out sufficiently to continue the steady gaze of the patient in the face of the Surgeon. The Surgeon now removes his hand quickly from before the left eye, and this is observed to be turned inwards, as the right was ; probably it now quickly adjusts itself, and, as at first, the right is again inverted.

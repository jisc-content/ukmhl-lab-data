It will be evident, therefore, from these details, that the Encyclopedia and Dictionary continues to show in this volume the characteristics of the earlier ones. The purely Dictionarial part endeavours, without striving after the degree of copiousness attained by some works which are Dictionaries only, to give the meaning of every medical term which is at all likely to puzzle the general practitioner in his reading of current medical and surgical literature; while the part which constitutes the Encyclopedia consists of articles which are authoritative, coming as they do from the pens of men who are experts in their various departments.

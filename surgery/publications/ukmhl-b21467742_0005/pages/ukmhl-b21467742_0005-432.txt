Insurance has been defined as "a contract whereby one party, in consideration of a stipu- lated sum, undertakes to indemnify the other against certain perils or risks to which he is exposed, or against the happening of some event." (From Marshall on Marine Insurance.) It is difficult saying when insurance had its origin, but it is known that it was in use in commerce in the fifteenth century, because an ordinance of Barcelona refers to a contract of insurance. In all probability, insurance was a common practice in commerce before any laws on the subject were recognised. Marine in- surance was one of the earliest branches, and was probably invented by the Jews and adopted by the Lombards. Life insurance was only a branch of marine insurance. Life insurance was well known in the sixteenth century. At Genoa, in 1588, wager policies and insurances on the lives of public men were absolutely prohibited without the leave of the Senate. All life assurance was prohibited by Philip II. in 1570, and his example was followed by other cities and states. The practice of insuring the lives of other people was soon recognised to be a public danger. Grivel remarks : "These kind of wagers are of sad augury and may occasion crimes." In 1753 Magens says : "Men insured freely. In London people take the liberty to make insurances on any one's life without ex- ception, and the insurers seldom inquire much if there are good or bad reasons for such an insurance, but only what the person's age is and whether he be of a good constitution or not. The common premium on a good life from twenty to fifty years of age is 5 per cent, and from fifty to sixty years 6 per cent." This insuring of other men's lives became such a crying evil in England that the famous Act of 1774 was passed, prohibiting all insurances on lives in which the person insuring had no interest. (Act 14 Geo. III. c. 48.) The first insurance company was established in England in 1706 by a charter of Queen Anne to Thomas Allan, the Bishop of Oxford, and others, and was named The Amicable. Each member paid a fixed annual sum, and the surplus at the end of the year was divided amongst the relatives of the deceased members. All were admitted at a uniform rate, and members' ages on admission ranged from twelve to forty-five. The Royal Exchange and London Assurance were empowered to carry on life insurance in 1720. The Equitable was established in 1762, the Westminster in 1792, and the Pelican in 1797. Insurance business has grown immensely during the nineteenth century. There were 8 companies in existence in England before 1800. In 1824 there were 39 ; 105 companies were added between 1824 and 1844; 272 new com- panies were established between 1844 and 1869. This rapid growth was partly due to the new impulse given to the starting of new companies by the repeal of the Bubble Act in 1825, and the passing of the Companies Acts of 1844 and 1862. Many of these companies have ceased to exist. In 1880, of the 39 companies established before 1824 all but one survived. Of the 105 established between 1824 and 1844, 38 had ceased to exist; and of the 272 established between 1844 and 1869, only 29 survived. It will be seen from the short history of life insurance just sketched that insurance in the eighteenth century could hardly be said to have been based on a scientific footing. From the quotation from Magens it will be seen that the rate of 5 per cent was put on lives from twenty to fifty, and 6 per cent from fifty to sixty. This haphazard way of imposing rates of premium resulted from a want of knowledge of the rates of mortality amongst individuals of different ages. At that time little was known of what is called expectation of life, although it is true that the term " expectation of life " was used by De Moivre in the year 1725. Simpson was, in 1752, the first to arrange a table of expectations, but any tables previous to the Northampton seem to have been based on hypothesis rather than on statistics. The Northampton table of mortality was first given in a work on annuity by Dr. Price in 1771, and for many years that table was used by many of the insurance companies. What is known as the Carlisle table was the result of observations in two of the parishes of Carlisle, and published by Dr. Haysham in 1797, which observations were further elaborated by Mr. Milne. This table was for many years recog- nised as the most accurate. In 1843 tables giving the results of the experiences of seventeen of the insurance companies were compiled, and these were found to more nearly resemble the Carlisle than the Northampton tables. The total number of policies made use of in the compilation of these tables was 83,905, of which 44,877 were in existence, 25,247 withdrawn, and 13,781 had become claims by death. The most striking results obtained wereâ€”1st, the great mortality amongst Irish lives; 2nd, the marked difference in rate of mortality between males and females; 3rd, the near resemblance between town and country experience.

Rice Soup 1 pint of mutton, veal, or chicken broth. 1 table-spoonful of Patna rice. Yolk of an egg. 1 table-spoonful of cream. Strain the broth and remove all fat from it; put it into a clean saucepan with the rice well washed, and boil until the rice is perfectly soft. Then rub all through a fine sieve, rinse out the pan, and return the soup to it. Beat up the yolk of egg and cream with a fork; strain them into the soup, and stir care- fully over the fire until thoroughly hotâ€”but it must not be allowed to boil. Tapioca or sago may be used instead of rice to thicken with. Also three tomatoes might be boiled with the rice, and then rubbed through the sieve. This would make tomato soup.

Put all these into a saucepan with cold water, with bay leaf, parsley, salt, and peppercorns. Bring to boil and skim well. Simmer slowly from five to six hours; then strain through a fine sieve. Put the meat into a mortar; pound it well with a little liquid, and rub it through a wire sieve. Rinse out the pan; melt in it the butter; add the flour, and mix till smooth.

Cover the fish witli cold water, and add the salt. Bring to the boil and skim. After the soup has boiled for a few minutes lift out a few nice little pieces of fish free from skin and bone, and reserve them for serving in the soup at the end. Allow the rest to simmer slowly for | to 1 hour. Then strain through a wire sieve, and rub some of the white pieces through. Rinse out the pan the soup was cooked in. Melt in it the butter; add the flour, and mix these two smoothly together, being careful they do not brown. Then pour on the soup that has been sieved, and stir until boiling. Beat the yolk of egg and cream and milk together; and, when the soup is off the boil, beat these ingredients into it ; then strain through a fine strainer, stirring all the time. Do not let the soup boil after the yolk is added, or it will curdle. The pieces of fish that were reserved and the chopped parsley are now added.

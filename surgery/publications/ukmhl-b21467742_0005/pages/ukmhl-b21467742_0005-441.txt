LIFE INSURANCE 421 to the 40th latitude, 1 in 43 from the 40th to the 60th, and 1 in 50 from the 60th to the 80th. The death-rate among Europeans in the tropical and subtropical regions is probably- greater than these figures indicate, but much depends on the elevation of the country as'well as its sanitary conditions and freedom from special diseases such as malaria. High table- land is healthier for Europeans than low-lying districts, and much therefore depends on the configuration of the country. Companies are in the habit of imposing a certain increase of rate for those insured who reside in tropical or unhealthy climates, such as tropical Africa and East and West Indies. 6. Age of Proposer.—This, of course, is one of the most important for the insurance company to ascertain, because the expectation of life of healthy persons is calculated from the age. Many expectation of life tables have been framed to show what the average expectation of life of persons is at different ages. These tables have already been referred to; but as they are of great importance, I herewith give the CarHsle table alongside of the Institute of Expectation of Life according to the Carlisle AND Institute of Actuaeies' Tables.

The first was based on calculations of the deaths in two parishes in Carlisle during several years at the end of last century, the latter was the ex- perience table of twenty insurance companies compiled in 1869. These tables are used by the insurance company as the basis for calculat- ing the rate of premium to be paid by each policy-holder, the amount of premium per cent varying according to age. Lig'a.mentS.—-Band-like structures, usu- ally of compact connective tissue, which unite the articular ends of bones or adjacent organs or jmrts—e.g. the broad ligament (see Broad Ligaments ; Generation, Female Organs of ; PuERPERiUM, Involution of Broad Ligaments); the infundibulo-pelvic ligament (see Generation, Female Organs of. Fallopian Tubes); the liga- mentum latum pulmonis (see Pleura, Diseases OF, Anatomy); the ovarian ligament (see Genera- tion, Female Organs op. Ovaries ; Puerperium, Physiology, Involution); the round ligament (see Generation, Female Organs of, Ligameiits of the Uterus; Pregnancy, Physiology, Change in Ligaments ; Puerperium, Physiology, Involu- tion) ; suspensory ligament of axilla (see Axilla, Anatomy) ; and the uterine, utero-sacral, and utero-vesical ligaments (see Generation, Female Organs of. Ligaments of Uterus, etc.). See also under Joints, Ankle, Hip-Joint, Knee-Joint, etc. Ligar'S Line.—In order to determine the point of emergence of the sciatic artery, a line is drawn from the posterior superior iliac spine to the inner point of trisection of a line between the tuberosity of the ischium and the great tro- chanter, and the middle point in this line will indicate the artery. Lig'a.tion.—The applying of a ligature, e.g. to a blood-vessel, pedicle, or stump (cord). Ligfature.—The tying of an artery, pedicle, etc. with a thread or cord of silk, catgut, etc., or the thread or cord itself. See Aneurysm (Treatment, Ligature); Arteries, Ligature of ; Labour, Management of (Care of Child, Tyimj the Cord). Lig'ht. See Balneology (Solar and Radia- tion Baths, Light Baths); Physiology, Senses (Vision); Pupil (Nervous Mechanism) ; Spectro- scope in Medicine. Lig'htening.—The sensation of greater ease in respiration and digestion which precedes the onset of labour, and is due to the sinking down of the uterus into the pelvis. See Labour, Physiology op (Factors of Labour, the Powers). Lig'ht!ng".—The illumination of dwelling houses, public buildings, towns, roads, etc. with gas, lamps, electric light, etc. See Ventilation and Warming. Lightning'.

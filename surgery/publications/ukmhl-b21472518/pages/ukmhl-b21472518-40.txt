The original memoirs and works in medi- cine and the allied sciences bear a considerable pro- portion to the whole of the scientific productions of the world; and some idea may be formed of the number of these, from the fact that the separate scientific memoirs and works of all countries, of which the distinct titles could be ascertained as having appeared between the years 1800 and 1863 inclusive, brought together under the authority pf the President and Council of the Royal Society, reach the astonishing total of jl20,000, while every year's produce is becoming greater than the last. The medical literature of Germany, France, Hol- land, and other continental countries, abounds in materials of great value to us, both as scientific men and as practitioners (as ours, no doubt, does to them). But unless we are kept fully aware, in each department, of the additions as they accrue, we are in danger of lagging in the race of improvement, and can hardly hope to do justice to our patients or to ourselves. But, Gentlemen, I must conclude. I would wil- lingly have resigned iuto abler hands the task unexpectedly imposed upon me by your Council. Circumstances and my tastes have caused me for some time past to desire to play my humble part noiselessly in the world; and I have been less able than I could have sometimes wished to share even in the pleasure and the profit of professional gather- ings.

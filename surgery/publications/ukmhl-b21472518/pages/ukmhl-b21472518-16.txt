Gentlemen, I look upon the present meeting, com- prising native members of every branch of our pro- fession (and would that we could welcome, in future years, many more brother members from other lands!), as one representing the idea most needing to be insisted on amongst " doctors" at this time and in our ovm country, and which, I am persuaded, men like Harvey and the Hunters would have been fore- most to assert and act uponâ€”the idea of the oneness of our common calling. And can we aver that there is no' need to advance this idea ? For, could we imagine these great ones of the past to be still with us, what special encouragement or opportunities for his cherished pursuits, we may ask, would Harvey now find in his own favoured College of Physicians, whose welfare and improvement, we are told, " was the chief object that occupied his mind for several years before his death," but where " solemn lectures on surgery" are no longer given; where there is no anatomical or chirurgical work performed; and where no " repository for simples and rarities" exists, such as he fondly hoped by his benefactions and his ex- ample to have founded; even no museum of morbid anatomy, such as Baillie and Bright would have longed for.

Finally, could his greater brother, immortal by his Treatise on the Blood, but being " only a surgeon,"

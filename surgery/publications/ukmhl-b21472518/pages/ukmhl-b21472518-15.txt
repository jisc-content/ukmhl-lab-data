Had the two fields of thought been in his estimation distinct and separate, he could not have achieved in each so great a victory : in each, it will be found on examination, his success depended largely on the real union which he more than any of his contemporaries, or even of his pre- decessors, recognised to exist between them. English surgery and English medicine, in all their depart- ments, have been since strongly coloured by this principle. This indeed is the abiding lesson which his life and labours have imparted to those who suc- ceed him in the noble function of ministering to the wounded and sick, in his own country and through- out the world.

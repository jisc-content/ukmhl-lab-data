35 to characterise as in some of its developments not robust or manly, and therefore not morally sound or grounded on right reason, which is inclined to bring popular indignation, excited by speeches at public meetings and by essays produced under an artificial stimulation, to bear on men of science desiring to investigate great principles in the doctrine of life, by experiments on living animals. Having formerly, when circumstances led me into this region of in- quiry, and in the performance of my duty as a Pro- fessor of Physiology, taken part in such experiments, and knowing well how vast an accession of know- ledge useful to man has accrued, and will certainly hereafter accrue, from such experiments, I should be ashamed of myself, and deem myself to be neglect- ing a moral duty, if I omitted to take this opportu- nity of protesting with all my force against the imputation of " cruelty to animals" sometimes raised against medical men on this ground. As inheritors of the labom-s, and, let us hope, of the scientific spirit, of Harvey, whose works abound with evidences that the discovery of the cir- culation itself was largely due to such experi- ments, we should be untrue to our ancestry and to our convictions, if we hesitated to uphold, publicly if need be, the lawfulness, the expediency, nay, the desirableness, of such experiments; and, as it seems also to me, if we failed in our corporate character to take more active steps than at present to promote these in their proper place and degree, among other kindred pursuits. A society, respectable and praiseworthy when di- recting its shafts against the meaningless and selfish acts of vulgar and brutal natures, or when striving in various ways to diminish the pain inflicted on animals put to those human uses which general con- sent, no less than the widest view of all nature, sanctions, is no longer to be commended when it ventures to raise a prejudice against the refined and honourable inquiries of educated men, seeking to advance legitimately a branch of knowledge most nearly touching human interests of a lastingly high

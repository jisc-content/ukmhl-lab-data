21 ing some vulgar echoes of old charges against us, will play an useful and moderating part, by reassuring less informed persons and quelling groundless alarms. Let us cast aside the foolish thought so flattering to a shallow pride, that man's dignity depends in any the least degree on the mode of origin of his material organisation, whether in the individual or the race, any more than on the structure of his matm-e ma- terial organs; and not rather on that capacity for the reception of the Divine Spirit, and for elevated commune with God and His Works, which comes with growth, but with which, at the earlier moments of his origin, he has not yet been endowed.

33 commit the little less than crime of the huge flattery of my own class, to the lowering of what should be our higher aims ; and I say, with all love and respect for my fellows, and with a deep sense of my own shortcomings, that we are not doing, as a body, what we might do in Britain to extend and deepen the scientific foimdations of our Art. In our corporate capacity, we ought to foster especially those departments of research which are letist likely to be undertaken by individuals without such encouragement; which, indeed, can hardly be prosecuted at all without means and appliances beyond the ordinary reach of individuals. We need in England the pubUc open establishment of means and apparatus for original research and observation, especially for our younger men, in the sciences minis- terial to medicine, particularly physiological and pa- thological laboratories and for organic chemistry. These should be in part connected with Museums, Medical Schools, and Hospitals. The lay governors of great hospitals should be moved to consider it as one of their most urgent functions, to see that no unnecessary waste of the precious means of improving knowledge, placed under their keeping, occurs. The progress which recent years have witnessed, points with sufficient clearness to the direction in which the next steps may be most profitably taken. It is in the field of exact scientific investigation into questions and problems which the latest advances have opened to view. Here each new fact and prin- ciple, patiently grounded on previous knowledge and established beyond dispute, though it may for a while appear an idle and unimportant addition to the com- mon store, may fructify hereafter into some solid and useful generalisation, applicable, in the most un- expected and startUng manner, to human happiness and the success of our cures. In any step taken by the whole professional body for the encouragement and promotion of the medical sciences, we should not, of course, look for imme- diate results of that kind termed in common language useful; that is, having an immediate and obvious E

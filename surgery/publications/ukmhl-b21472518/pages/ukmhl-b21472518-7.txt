6 wliich has been for many years working towards the realisation of it ? Let us, then, spend a short time in tracing, if we can, the scope and meaning of this work of ours, which interests ourselves so very closely, and our fellow men hardly less. And for this purpose, our past history shall first be adverted to, so that we may gain, as from a distance, a more general and a juster view of our whole position. With the earlier developments of the Art in remote ages we are little concerned, except to observe, that the same simplicity of conception which we now find among our less instructed countrymen, implied in their respectful customary epithet of " Doctor" ad- dressed to us all alike, regardless happily both of University-acquired titles of too motley import and of modern Acts of Parliamentâ€”this same simplicity of conception would probably apply still more to the Healers of a dawning civilisation; who, though they then, as now, must have failed in any instance to embrace aU Jmowledge and all the powers of treat- ment, yet could hardly have been other at first than general practitioners. Probably the state of the Healing Art (if so it can be called) in various savage tribes, and among the antique and decrepit communities of the East, only now being awakened out of the torpor of tens, per- haps of hundreds, of centuries, by the rade shock of contact with modern European forces, may exhibit to us, not inaptly, what it once was among our- selves.

But generally, where individuals evinced or professed an aptitude, opportunities of experience would be rife enough; and according to the nature and variety of these, would be the developments of knowledge and the divisions of practice. At a later period, the elaborate civilisation of the Greeks and Komans, and subsequently of the Ara-

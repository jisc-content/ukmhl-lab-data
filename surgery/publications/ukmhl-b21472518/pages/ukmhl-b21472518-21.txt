We see mankind every where becoming more and more one family, chiefly by the increase of man's dominion over Nature, through augmenting knowledge of her laws. It is but a little while ago that Galvani and Volta, experimenting on harmless frogs, in the highest spirit of Science, opened up new provinces of re- search, in which Davy, and Oersted, and Ampere, and Faraday, were soon to astonish the world by the rapidity and brilliance of their discoveries. And it seems to me but yesterday, for I was there, that our Wheatstone, under the approving eyes of Daniell, passing the wii'e of his battery beneath the Thames, in presence of the lamented Prince whom we had then just welcomed to our shores as the Consort of our Queen, proved the possibility of the subaqueous transmission of those subtle vibrations, whose rate of travel we now know to exceed in a very high degree that of the mandates of the will along the nerves. Yet already, by a combination of enterprise and skill unparalleled, the magic twine unites two continents; and man's thoughts, cyphered with unerring truth by sUent-speaking symbols, in the last degree refined, and borne onwards by tender tremors of the metal, fainter yet far fleeter than iEoHan whisperings, are traversing momentarily— even as I speak—the awful solitudes of Atlantic depths, under vertical miles of incumbent water; where no sound, hardly light itself can penetrate; all heedless of the fogs and icebergs and mimic storms of the surface, 15,000 feet above.

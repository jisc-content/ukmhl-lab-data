But, indeed, although the practice of Surgery in particular must have reflected, Hke other arts, the prevalent temper and ideas of those times, and may have been often rude, coarse, and undiscriminating, based on loose surmises, false analogies, or on preju- dices or fancies altogether absurd, hence becoming what we might now be inclined to call mifeeling, even cruel; 'yet always, its aim being beneficent, its tendencies must have been so too ; a humanising art, intervening on the side of mercy and pity, even in the wildest hours of savagery or war. Turning to Britain and the dark ages, haply our Chirurgeons were a sorry set, who carried out lamely the despised manual part of treatment, under the direction of an order of men, by priestly oflS.ce, or by education and social rank, above themselves; to whose authority they bowed: a set of men misnamed learned, ready in every difficulty to quote Galen without understanding him, and generally more ig- norant than the poor handicraftsmen they controlled; men whose word could seldom be questioned, never gainsaid; though, from the falseness of their princi- ples, they could never advance one step in true knowledge.

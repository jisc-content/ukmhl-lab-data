From the bed of those watery deeps, too, abysses no longer unfathomable, the finger of man has picked up evidences of teeming life there also, such, probably, as he now knows to have built up, by slow and gradual accumulation, in geological ages of unassignable remoteness, strata of the earth's now solid crust, tens of thousands of feet in thickness: and these in their turn contain the fragmentary but faithful records of series of organisms that have pre- ceded the existing forms; and which seem to inti- mate, with other collateral proofs (though I prejudge nothing), that life has been continuous on our planet from the first origin of organic being, through suc- cessive generative links of evolution, even down to, and into, the very times in which we live.

Let whoever loves Truth, and the God of Truth, await it with perfect cahnness, though it should possibly faU to coincide with some prejudices of the timid. I venture to express an earnest hope, that our profession, which beyond others is brought to the threshold of such questions by the nature of its studies and by its habits of thought, and which I aver to be signally remarkable for its love of truth and rcgai-d for religion, notwitlistand-

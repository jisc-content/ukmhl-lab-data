23 time in its living acts, that marvellous mechanism in its most exquisite and joy-inspiring movements, as well as when it is oppressed by disease, which stands as a sentinel at the orifice of the air-passages, and on which the voice and speech primarily depend. And need I advert to other applications of optical mechanism, or recount how one has called forth another, until the various internal surfaces and structures, particularly those of the organ of sight itself, ai'e now opened to hourly survey, to scrutiny most exact and delicate, so, that often even the pulsa- tion of the smallest arteries or veins and the physical conditions of the capillary bloodvessels, with almost the earliest and slightest signs of morbid change may be detected and made available as guides to treat- ment? Much might be said under this head. Diseased states thus submitted to the faithful eye- sight are seized on by the mind with a vividness that is of inestimable value to the practitioner, in framing his conclusions as to treatment; and he can judge, too, by the dii-ect evidence of sense, how far to continue to follow up these. In a word, all the advantage the sur- geon has hitherto had, over him who deals with con- cealed diseases, in that he has had ocular demonstration of his facts, the Physician now enjoys in regard to many internal organs. The Surgeon also participates largely in this expansion of our field of view, while a collateral result is that the Physician in many in- stances finds himself under the dilemma, either of undertaking operations strictly surgical, or of aban- doning some departments of treatment and some im- portant organs, that custom has hitherto assigned to him. Many have had the good sense to consider simply their patients' advantage, and not the punc- tilios of a class; and thus thfere has been a consider- able, and as I regard it, a very satisfactory demolition of old and artificial bariiers between different grades of practitioners, which the future progress of Physical Diagnosis must still further tend to i^romote. Take another example. By means of that modern optical triumph, the Compound Microscope, which takes us, as it were, among the very elements of form

12 truer followers of Harvey. Holding always to Ana- tomy, as by the very nature of their function they found themselves more and more constrained to do, and also finding apter materials for study in the more exposed, and less recondite diseases falling to their care, as well as in the open results of wounds, iucluding those of their own making, they have joined Anatomy, Pathology and Sur- gery in a natural alliance, most favourable to pro- gTCss and always abounding in new fruits, and have gradually risen in influence; establishing in our great hospitals, and in our iieets and armies an equality of rank with their more erudite, but (must we say it in all kindness ?) unhandy brethren; and unostenta- tiously but surely asserting more and more the claim of the Surgeon's Hand to be guided by the Surgeon's Mind and Conscience, from which, henceforth, it can never again be unholily divorced.

Both when young were Sui'geons and Anatomists, toiling in Harvey's " workhouse", and William acquired his fame in practice as an Accoucheur. Both were illustrious by the Museums they created; one of which has since become, by state-purchase and the subsequent labours of Richard Owen,—indeed of more than one kindred mind,—supported by the liberal sub- sidies of the College of Sm-geons, the most glorious appanage of a great Profession that the world has yet seen; and the other is in the City of Glasgow, to which the munificence of its i^'ounder bequeathed it, with an endowment for its maintenance. John Hunter was so largely employed during many years in applying his knowledge to the relief of hu- man ills, that it is indeed marvellous how he could have at the same time laboured so hard in the gene- ral field of the Sciences of Life. But (given his mental

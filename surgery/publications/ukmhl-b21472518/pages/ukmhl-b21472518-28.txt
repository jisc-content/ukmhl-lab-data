28 without accurate chart or compass,â€”or worse, under the deceptive guidance of some false delusive though vaunted theory. While, in the uncertain and ever- varying phases of practice, we may none of us afford to disregard the aid of our own unwritten ex- perience, or those general impressions left on our minds by a long series of Empirical observations, in which as yet no clue to a satisfactory explanation has been descried, we may rejoice that these late advances are at the command of all, who, being honest enough to desire to detect the nature of a disease committed to their care by a suffering f eUow-creatui'e, will, with ordinary intelligence, instruct themselves in the re- quisite, and usuaDy simple, physical tests. So far as they extend, they are to be most highly prized. They bear the stamp of all true knowledge in being useful, available, and not apt to deceive; and having been once acquired, they become henceforward the in- alienable inheritance of all mankind, and doubtless the starting point for future conquests of a like kind. The subject of Ansesthetics is too apposite for the general drift of the present address to be altogether passed over in this place, though it is hard to men- tion it and not to pursue it to the exclusion of all else. Dim notices of the use of medicinal agents to pre- vent pain in surgical operations are not altogether wanting in very early times; and the desire and hope of finding some means for effecting this was certainly felt by more than one person during the last century. Even a method by compression of the nerves was actually tried in one of the London hos- pitals. But our present universal use of this emi- nent blessing to suffering human nature is the result, first, of the progress of pure science, not medical; then, of the applications of pure science by men de- vote4 to particular speciahties of practice; and both hemispheres share the glory of it. Let us look at Cavendish, Priestley, and Lavoisier, at work in theii* pneumatic laboratories; at Beddoes, with young Davy, in Bristol, trying to make inhala- tion of gases useful in medicine, inhaling laughing- gas, and noting its effects; at a public lecturer at

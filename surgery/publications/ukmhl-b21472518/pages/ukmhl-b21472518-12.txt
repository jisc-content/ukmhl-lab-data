How profound a truth he beauti- fully proclaims, when he says:—" If you will enter •svith Heraclitus in Aristotle into a Workhouse (for so I will call it) for inspection of viler creatures, come hither, for the immortal gods are here likewise, and the Great and Almighty Father is sometimes most conspicuous in the least and most inconsiderable of His Creatures!" The torch of Harvey was lighted in Italy, where, while the fine arts were already waning rapidly. Science was rearing erect her standard; and at Padua, where he listened to the teaching of the greatest masters of anatomy, medicine, and surgery, Fabricius ab Acquapendente, Minadous and Casserius, he must doubtless have discoursed with, and caught the spirit of one still greater, Galileo. At home he may pro- bably have known personally, certainly by his works, the immortal author of the Advancement of Learning. Thus is Science exhibited as not of a country, but of the world. But tracing onwards the progress of the Healing Art in England, we shall find the Institutions, founded at first on traditions and customs which represented the convenience of an imperfect and transitional stage of society, not less than indi- vidual tastes, growing rigid under the influence of forms and titles, and gathering around themselves clustering personal and corporate interests, not al- ways in harmony with those higher objects \>j which alone their establishment could have been at first justified; and thus tending to keep apart, though with decreasing force, the two great bands of a com- mon profession. The Physicians, it must, I think, be said on the whole, though with some remarkable exceptions, re- ceded during the last century from the spu'it and the traditions of Harvey, while they maintained orations to his memory. It is not surprising that Anatomy and Surgery should have ceased to be actively pro- moted by a College, wliich was gi-adually losing its hold on the surgical domain of practice, in proportion

24 and the rudiments of organic structure,—a world we are apt to lightly regard, though it has infinite uses for us, as it has infinite beauties,—by this an in- structed practitioner, even one not highly gifted, but only conscientiously alert and observant, can say ^\^th confidence of an organ deep in the wasting frame before him, beyond his touch, out of his sight, which emits no sound, and is the seat of no pain, "This gland has been certainly passing insidiously through this, or that, important destructive change, it is now so and so, I can accomplish this, or probably only tliis, for its relief, and this, or this, wiU be the end!" And not to weary you, Gentlemen, with more examples from the field of diagnosis, the results of Chemical Examination, frequently seconded by the microscope, need only to be alluded to in order to take their eminently important place in this imperfect sketch, by the side of the other aids to physical in- vestigation of the signs and footsteps of disease, con- ferred upon us by modern science. As to the intimate nature of disease and of health, modern Physiology is a platform, on which all Prac- titioners have an almost equal footing; where they meet and cross each other at every turn, and find everywhere the oj^portunity of a community of thought and action. All admit that disease is such a departure from a state of health as oversteps those un- definable limits which the organisation will bear, with- out strain, or curtailment of its perfection. But these are not now such vague words as they might once have been; for vivid light has been tlu-own upon many of the abstruser problems that formerly perplexed us; the details of the interwoven structures and of tlie complex functions of our composite frame have been zealously and perseveringly traced by some of the acutest observers and of the keenest intellects that have ever lived; with a harvest of results so plentiful, so reliable, so mutually illustrative, and on the whole so marvellous, as to make very much of the know- ledge of even the last generation seem antiquated and obsolete. And we may accept it as a truth, that every step forwards in our knowledge of the healthy

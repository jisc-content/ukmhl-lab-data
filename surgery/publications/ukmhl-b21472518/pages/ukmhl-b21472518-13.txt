11 as sui'geons were becoming independent of the old restraint. The Physicians were now, by their abstinence from all manipulative treatment, in a position of in- creasing isolation as regards a great domain of the field of experience; they were specialists by a great defect, by a self-negation ; and tlie consequence was that many of the higher intellects among them betook themselves to a too exclusive cUnical observation of disease, analogous to that of some of the ancients, and not sufficiently seconded by deep and personal study of the organic structure, and the laws of life; while others distinguished themselves by learned or philosophical labours, more or less important, and more or less connected with the immediate work of their calling. The result has been, that the medical world has seen several systems or schemes of treatment pro- mulgated on insufficient bases, but with much pre- tension of a simpHcity, for which nature gives no warrant; and which have yielded one after another at the first summons of reason and common sense; not without grave discrediting of the whole profession in the pubUc eye; and not without giving a sort of countenance to that easiness of behef with which, within our own century, have been received by the public the flimsy follies of the shallowest and barrennest, the most credulous and the most boastful of medical phantom sects, that of the self-styled homoeopaths. In the more recent times, however, of John Richard Farre, of Matthew BaiUie, and of Richard Bright, they have laboured afresh in the patient study of disease, not only dui-ing life, but have themselves, with their own hands and scalpels, sought real knowledge by the personal examination of the organs after death. They have also taken a large and important share in advancing the phy- sical, chemical, and physiological sciences; in these and other ways thus setting a splendid example, and redeeming a position which might otherwise have been jeopardised. For the Surgeons had approved themselves the

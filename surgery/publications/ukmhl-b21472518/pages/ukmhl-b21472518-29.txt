27 Boston, in America, nearly fifty years afterwards, exhibiting its well known effects to an audience, among whom was a Surgeon-Dentist; at the sudden idea of this one to apply it as a remedy in his own case, for he was tormented with a toothache. It succeeded; but afterwards, when he had m-ged its adoption on a great operating surgeon, and it had been actually tried several times, the uncertainty of its effects caused it to be completely abandoned. But the idea had been too intensely impressed on some lookers-on to be ever again lost sight of. Fara- day had already long since shown the great simi- larity of the effects of laughing-gas and of the vapour of ether, and this was familiarly taught to students in chemistry. But nearly two years still elapsed ere another Surgeon-Dentist, who had been present on the former occasion, tried the ether, and foimd it to succeed so perfectly, and to be so manageable, that he at once proclaimed it to the world; and it was soon adopted by the surgeons of all coimtries. But now a Pharmaceutical Chemist of Liverpool, at the instance of a more gifted mind, suggested another substance, a product of modern chemistry, discovered simultaneously in Europe and America sixteen years before, which had been medicinally used, and even its name philosophically settled ac- cording to the analogy of its exact constitution, by one of the first Chemists of France. The gifted man was an Obstetric Practitioner of Edinburgh, whose fame, already world-wide, will not rest here- after solely even on so great a fact. After applying it in his own department of practice, the adoption of chloroform by surgeons, to the gradual exclusion of ether, rapidly followed ; and all mankind will profit by it until, in the sure progress of the Art, some other anaesthetic shall be found, without even the slight inconveniences of this one. In reviewing the subject of anaesthetics, we cannot fail to be struck by two pregnant facts. The first is, that while Surgery has chiefly felt their influence, and its practice has been modified by them in a re- markable degree, Surgeons have been but passive re-

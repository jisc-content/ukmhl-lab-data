39 solemn act. It has seemed to rae that we have been weaker for good tlian we might have been ; and especially for the furtherance of those beneficent objects, which no class will pursue if not our own, and none so well as our own; which, therefore, it would seem to be incumbent on us to prosecute by all the means in our power; and which have appa- rently been less thought of because of our divisions. Not real divisions of feeling, nor any wide or deep divergence of interests, but only a want of united action; through the continued existence, in too much of their traditional shape, of isolated Institutions, which, in their present form, we have somewhat out- grown, and which seem to need some considerable re-arrangement, if not consolidation, if they are to represent the altered state of the whole profession, such as it has come to be in our own age of astonish- ing progress. I have now endeavoured to convey to you, I fear at too great length, my general impressions on this head, I hope without offence to any one and with sincerity, certainly very inadequately. I have long looked upon this Association as the element in our profession out of which stronger bonds of union between all ranks, classes, and degrees, might be expected to grow, than out of any other—at least, at present; for it is framed on the most comprehensive basis, and is organised so that all interests in all parts of our common country might find their place and voice ia it. May it be more and more every year an arena where the wisely expressed objects of its Founders may be temperately, but steadily and earnestly pur- sued—above all, in a spirit of union! and may the leading minds of our profession, whose cooperation we so much require, and so highly appreciate, come more and more amongst us, to help forward that great and noble Art of Healing, to which, in one or other of its departments, the lives of all of us are devoted!

36 order. For every really forward step taken in the science of man's life, is a part of that progress which is indisputably adding to the sum of hmnan happi- ness, not only in the present time, but in the future. It is only those well-meaning persons who are Uttle acquainted with the necessary elements, and the ex- cessive difficulty, of such researches, and apparently still less with the motives of the higher class of sci- entific inquirers, who can presume to endeavour to thrust themselves into a province where no present abuse calls for interference. I think it would be wiser for the excellent persons in question to confine themselves to those spheres of exertion in which all good men and scientific men must heartily bid them God speed, rather than wear the appearance of at- tempting to add to their iclat, as a popular society, by a foolish crusade against what can certainly be justified, and must even be applauded by all well- wishers of their own kind, if we admit, as society seems inclined to do at present, that to apply ani- mals to piu-poses usefid to man, is one of the mani- fest ends of their mutual relationship on the eartli. In the country of Harvey, and in the bosom of the profession which derives so much glory from his name, in the country of John Hunter, of Astley Cooper, and of Brodie, there should be no doubt as to the free allowance of dissections of living crea- tures for the advancement and communication of a knowledge so indispensable for our race and for every generation of it. It seems to me ill-advised and unwise to attempt to define too closely the limits within which such experiments may be performed or repeated; since those only can properly judge of them who have undertaken the honoui-able respon- sibility of prosecuting original researches in this field, or of handing on to othera the methods and results of such inquiries. To the conscience and human feelings of these may safely be committed the discretion as to how far tliis exercise of man's pre- rogative over all the lower organisations may be cai-ried, without the abuse of inflicting unnecessary pain.

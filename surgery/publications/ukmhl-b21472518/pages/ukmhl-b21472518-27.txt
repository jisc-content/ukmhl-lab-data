25 body, so it be real, must leatl us right onwards, too, towai'ds a better understanding of disease; and if of disease, then also of our power of counteracting it, whether in the way of prevention, alleviation, or cure. As to modern treatment I shall only remark, that the direct and obvious tendency of all modern pro- gress hixs been to make it more rational and more simple; that is, more appropriate, first, to the pre- cise conditions, more coiTectly recognised in each case; and next, to the degree in which interference on our part is found likely to be advantageous or otherwise to the sufferer. No conceit of oui* great advances in the Medical Sciences, however, must beguile us into assuming that Medicine itself is a Science, or can ever become one, in the sense of our being ever likely to be able to practise it on principles unerring and exact. It is not in any trixe sense a Science, but the application of many sciences, and indeed of all appropriate and available knowledge, of whatever kind, to the relief of suffering. It is really an Art, as the Father of Medicine long since styled it; and woe be to those patients who fall into the hands of men, aiming at treating all who come to them and aU diseases on some single, so-called simple, principle, which can really be no other than the negation of all good sense and of all the Avell-understood conditions of our Art. It is an Art, however, which, while it must always be pursued with the very closest regard to the indi- vidual facts of the case, must in the interest of each patient be pursued in a Scientific Spirit, for thus only can the facts be didy interpreted and our treatment suitably applied. And it seems the special glory of the advances in Healing knowledge in our own day, that they are of a kind to supersede those vague, general observations by which a few rarely-gifted men could formerly, as now, make sagacious, pertinent, sometimes true guesses as to the nature and more latent relations of diseases (though those gifted men oftentimes fell into lamentable mistakes), while the generality steered D

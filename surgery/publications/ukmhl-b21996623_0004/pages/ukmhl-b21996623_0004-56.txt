PREFACE. xl Catalogues of the Hunterian Collections published under the auspices of the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons, it is competent for any one to judge of the grounds on which I have endeavoured to show that Hunter, as a comparative anatomist, merits a higher and altogether different station in science than has been awarded to him by Cuvier. Instead of viewing Hunter as one who had merely contributed a secondary proportion of detached facts to the general but unarranged stock of materials in comparative anatomy, it ap- pears to me that he marks a new epoch in its history, and that the historian of the natural sciences has just and sufficient grounds for regarding Hunter as the first of the moderns who treated of the organs of the animal body under their most gene- ral relations, and who pointed out the anatomical conditions which were characteristic of great groups or classes of animals; as one, in short, throughout whose works we meet with general propositions in comparative anatomy, the like of which exist not in the writings of any of his contemporaries or predecessors, save in those of Aristotle.

OBSERVATIONS ON BEES. 424 cident, that is, many things arise out of investigation that were not at first conceived, and even misfortunes in experiments have brought things to our knowledge that were not and probably could not have been pre- viously conceived: on the other hand, I have often devised experiments by the fire-side or in my carriage, and have also conceived the result; but when I tried the experiment the result was different, or I found that the experiment could not be attended with all the circumstances that were suggested. As bees, from their numbers, hide very much their operations, it is necessary to have such contrivances as will explore their oeconomy. Hives with glass lights in them often show some of their operations, and when wholly of glass still more ; but as they form such a cluster, and begin their comb in the centre, little can be seen till their work be- comes enlarged, and by that time they have produced a much larger quantity of bees, so as still to obscure their progress. Very thin glass hives are the best calculated for exposing their operations ; the di- stance from side to side about three inches; of a height and length suf- ficient for a swarm of bees to complete one summerâ€™s work in. As one perpendicular comb, the whole length and height of the hive, in the centre, dividing it into two, is the best position for exposing their operations ; it is necessary to give them a lead or direction to form it so; therefore it is proper to make a ridge along the top from end to end, in the centre, between the two sides, for they like to begin their comb from an eminence ; if we wished to have them transverse or oblique, it would only be necessary to make transverse or oblique ridges in the hive. I had one made of two broad pieces of plate-glass, with glass ends, which answered for simple exposure very well; but I often saw operations going on when I wished to have caught some of the bees, or to take out a piece of comb, &c.; therefore I had hives made of the same shape and size, but with different panes of glass, each pane opening with hinges, so that if I saw anything going on that I wished to examine more minutely or immediately, I opened the pane at this part and ex- ecuted what I wished as much as was in my power ; this I was obliged to do with great caution, as often the comb was fastened to the glass at this part. When I saw some operations going on, the dates or periods of which I wished to ascertain, such as the time of laying eggs, of hatch- ing, &c., I made a little dot with white paint opposite to the cell where the egg was laid and put down the date. From these animals forming colonies, and from a vast variety of effects being produced, and with a degree of attention and nicety that seem even to vie with man, man, not being in the least jealous, has wished to bestow on them more than they possess, viz. a reasoning faculty;

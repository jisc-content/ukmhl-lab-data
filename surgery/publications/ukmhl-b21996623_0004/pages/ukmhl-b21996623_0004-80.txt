24 ON THE GLANDS CALLED VESICULiE SEMINALES. the spermatic chord from this point to the testicle, I could not find any vas deferens; but, by beginning at the testicle, and tracing the epi- didymis from its origin, about half-way along where it lies upon the body of the testicle, I perceived that it at first became straight, and soon after seemed to terminate in a point. The canal at this part was so large as to allow of being filled with quicksilver; which, however, did not pass far, so that a portion of the epididymis was wanting, and like- wise the vas deferens for nearly the whole length of the spermatic chord of the right side*. On the left side the vas deferens began where the epididymis commonly terminates, and there was a deficiency of nearly an inch of the extremity of the epididymis f. I then dissected the bag above mentioned, which proved to be the two vesiculse ; for, by blowing air from one vas deferens, I could only inflate half of it, and from the other vas deferens the other half. They contained the mucus commonly found in these bags ; but, upon the most accurate examination, I could neither discover any duct leading from them to the prostate gland, nor the remains of onej. It was evident in this subject that there was no communication be- tween the vas deferens and epididymis, nor between these bags and the urethra. The caput gallinaginis had the common appearance, but there were no orifices to be found. The testicles were very sound, and the ducts from them to the epididymis were very manifest and contained semen ยง. From these circumstances we have a presumptive proof that the semen โข Vide Plate XXVII. fig. 1. f Vide Plate XXVII. fig. 2. + Vide Plate XXVIll. ยง As the semen, in consequence of this preternatural formation of parts, could not be conveyed to the urethra in the usual way, I conceived it possible that there might be another unnatural construction to make up for the deficiency in the vas deferens, and therefore examined it very carefully to see if there were no supernumerary vasa deferentia. I was led to do this more particularly from often finding parts resembling them where they could answer no kind of purpose. By a supernumerary vas deferens I mean a small duct which sometimes arises from the epididymis, and passes up the spermatic chord along with the vas deferens, commonly terminating in a blind end, near to which it is sometimes a little enlarged. I never found this duct go on to the urethra; but, in some instances, have seen it accompany the vas deferens as far as the brim of the pelvis. There is no absolute proof that this is a supernumerary vas defe- rens; but as we find the ducts of glands in general very subject to singularities, and that there are frequently supernumerary ducts; that there are often two ureters to one kidney, sometimes distinct from beginning to end; at other times both arising from one pelvis. These ducts, arising from the epididymis, I am inclined from analogy to be- lieve are of a nature similar to the double ureters. They resemble the vas deferens, as being continuations of some of the tubes of the epididymis; are convoluted where they come off from it; afterwards become a straight canal, and passing along with it for some way, they are then most commonly obliterated. The idea of their being for the purpose of returning the superfluous semen to the cir- culation must certainly be erroneous, from their being so seldom met with, and so very seldom continued further than the brim of the pelvis.

CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. 273 Nine ounces and a half of muscle from a bull’s neck, and the same quantity from that of an ox, were weighed in water, when the bull’s was thirty-one grains heavier, which is about xl^th®. From this experiment it appears that there is some difference in weight between a firm muscle and one that is naturally soft or lax, al- though not great, not even so much as one might at first imagine, at least not so much as the apparent difference in density. As it appears, from the above observations, that with the same given size the firmer muscles are the strongest, it becomes a question why every muscle in the bodies of the more perfect animals, and in the young of such animals, as also the muscles of the more simple animals in general, should not all have been of this texture, which constitutes the greatest power of contraction } This is perhaps not yet to be fully an- swered. It certainl)^ would have rendered man}^ parts of the more per.^ feet animals much smaller than what they now are, and would have had the same effect upon the whole body of the young of the more perfect animals, as also of the more simple animals universall)"; we must, how- ever, suppose that it would have been attended with some inconveni- ences, although at present what these inconveniences would have been may not be perfectly understood. * [See note a, p. 256.] VOL.

288 ON THE LATE MR. HUNTER’s PREPARATION “ The laws of optics are so well understood, and the knowledge of the eye, when considered as an optical instrument, has been rendered so perfect, that I do not consider myself capable of making any addition to it: but still there is a power in the eye by which it can adapt itself to different distances far too extensive for the simple mechanism of the parts to effect. This power writers upon this subject have been at great pains to investigate and explain. The motion of the cr}?^stalline humour for- wards and backwards was asserted by some to be the cause, wliile others supposed in the eye a pow'er to alter its shape, so as to shorten or lengthen its axis, which altered the distance between the crystalline humour and the point of impression; but we should consider that a part of the eye is itself a refractor, and that if its shape be altered so as to remove the crystalline humour from the point of impression, in order to enable it to bring a distant object to its proper focus on the retina, this effect will be in some degree counteracted by the anterior part of the eye refract- ing more than before, by being rendered more convex. But we have, in fact, no poM-er capable of producing this effect: for the straight muscles, so far from appearing to have this power, have been even sup- posed to flatten the eye, and shorten its axis : and it is very possible that the action of these muscles is such as tends to both effects; but, being in opposition to each other, the eye retains its shape, the inser- tion of these muscles being much more forwards than appears to be ne- cessary" for the simple motions of the eye. Further, when we consider that in many animals the shape of the eye is unalterable, as in all of the whale tribe, the sclerotic coat being above half an inch thick and com- posed of a strong tendinous substance ;■—that in many fish this coat is composed of cartilage ; and in all birds the anterior part of it is (I believe) composed of bone ;—from all these considerations, I saw no power that could adapt the eye to the various distances of which we find it capable in the human body, unless we suppose the crystalline humour to be varied in figure, which can only be effected by a muscular action within itself. With this idea strongly impressed upon my mind, and finding that in many animals, when the crystalline humour was coagulated, it had a fibrous structure like muscles, I confess it seemed to me to con- firm it; but as this might to others appear only conjecture, requiring some proof, I set about such experiments as were best adapted for that purpose. Knowing that in all violent deaths the muscles contract, I supposed the crystalline humour, if muscular, would show signs of this effect; for which purpose I got the eyes of bullocks when removed from the sockets, the moment the animal was knocked down, and while the eyes were warm the humours were removed.”

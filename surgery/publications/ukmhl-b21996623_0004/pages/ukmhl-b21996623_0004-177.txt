OBSERVATIONS ON DIGESTION. 121: a mechanical power, nor contractions of the stomach, nor on heat, but something secreted in the coats of the stomach, and thrown into its ca- vity, which there animalizes the food, or assimilates it to the nature of the blood^. The power of the gastric juice is confined or limited to certain substances, generally of the vegetable and animal kingdoms; and although this menstruum is capable of acting independently of the stomach, yet it is indebted to that viscus for its existence and conti- nuance. ^ [In the original paper the following note here occurs : “ In all the animals, whe- ther carnivorous or not, upon which I made observations or experiments to discover whether or not there was an acid in the stomach (and I tried this in a great variety.) I constantly found that there was an acid, but not a strong one, in the juices contained in that viscus in a natural state.” The omission of this note both in the 1st and 2nd editions of the Animal (Economy was probably a consequence of the doubt subsequently entertained by Hunter of the natural presence of an acid in the gastric juice; but as the existence of hydrochloric acid as an essential constituent of the animalizing secre- tion of the stomach is now satisfactorily determined, we have thought it proper to re- store this record of the agreement of a great proportion of Hunter’s experience with that of late observers on this subject.]

OBSERVATIONS ON DIGESTION, 94 horny substance, forming an inner cuticle, but differing in some respects from the common cuticle ; this horny substance not only differs in struc- ture from the common cuticle, but in its attachment, from cuticle, nails, and hoofs. The cutis, where it is covered by such substances, has a vast number of villi on its surface, which pass into corresponding per- forations in the cuticle; from this structure of parts, when the cuticle, nails, or hoofs are separated, their inner surface appears to be full of small perforations, and the cutis from which they have been removed is villous ; and these villi are more numerous in some parts than in others, where the sense of touch is required to be delicate or acute. But the inner lining of the gizzard is just the reverse, that surface of the horny substance which is in contact with the gizzard being villous, and when separated, the inner surface of the gizzard appearing perforated. These villi are either the last-formed parts of this horny substance, or are the fibres of which the horny coat is composed. It is probable that this horny substance takes the form of villi that it may be more firmly con- nected with the gizzard, in which acute sensation is not required. I may remark here, that the experiments made on the digestion of ru- minating animals have been very deficient^, arising from this process in them being more complicated than in the stomachs of other animals, and requiring attention to be paid to certain circumstances, which can- not take place in stomachs of only one cavity. The circumstance mentioned by Spallanzani, of ruminating animals voiding the tubes by the anus, shows that the whole food is not neces- sarily returned into the mouth to be chewed a second time; for if it were, the tubes would certainly come up likewise, and would as cer- tainly be thrown out of their mouths as improper to be chewed, a cir- cumstance which often really happened. But it was hardly necessary to make experiments to ascertain whether ruminating animals digested meat, when we know that in some cold countries the cattle are fed on dried fish, and most animals eat their own secundines : indeed the cir- cumstance of animals living upon both animal and vegetable food might have taught us that the mode of digesting both (whatever it is) was the same; therefore all that was wanted must have been to discover that mode ; except we could absurdly conceive that two different modes might take place in the same stomach at the same time. Spallanzani gives the opinion of authors respecting digestion ; and so Â® [This deficiency has recently been supplied by M, Floiirens, in an elaborate series of experiments made on living sheep, in which fistulous communications had been established between the external surface and the different-cavities of the stomach.

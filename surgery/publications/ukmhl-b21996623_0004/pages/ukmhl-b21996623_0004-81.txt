ON THE GLANDS CALLED VESICUL.E SEMINALES. 25 can be absorbed in the body of tlie testicle and in the epididymis, and that the vesiculae secrete a mucus which they are capable of absorbing when it cannot be made use of. We may likewise infer from what has been said that the semen is not retained in reservoirs after it is secreted, and kept there till it is used, but that it is secreted at the time in con- sequence of certain affections of the mind stimulating the testicles to this action; for we find that if lascivious ideas are excited in the mind, and the paroxysm is afterwards prevented from coming on, the testicles become painful and swelled from, we may suppose, the quantity of se- men secreted, and the increased action of the vessels, which pain and swelling is removed immediately upon the paroxysm being brought on and the semen evacuated ; but if that does not take place, the action of the vessels will still be kept up, and the pain in the testicles in general continue till the paroxysm and evacuation of the semen is brought on to render the act complete, without which a stop cannot be so quickly put to the action of the vessels that produce the secretion, nor the parts be allowed so easily to resume their natural state. There is at this time no sensation of any kind felt in the seat of the vesiculse seminales, which shows that the action is in the testicles, and in them alone. The pain in the testicles, in consequence of being filled with semen and of the action being incomplete, is sometimes so considerable as to make it ne- cessary to produce an evacuation of the semen to relieve the patient. It may be observed, in support of this opinion, that these bags are as full of mucus in bodies much emaciated, where the person has died from a lingering disease, as in those of the strong and robust, whose death has been occasioned by violence or acute diseases; and they are nearly as full in the old as in the young; which, most probably, would not be the case if they contained semen. These facts, taken from the human subject, are, I think, sufficient to establish the opinion which I have laid down; but, for the satisfaction of others, I shall give such facts and observations as have occurred in my dissection of different animals as tend to clear up the point in question. These vesiculae are not similar either in shape or contents in any two genera^ of animals which I have dissected; and they differ more in size, according to the bulk of the animal, than any other parts whose uses in different animals are supposed to correspond; while the semen in most of those which I have examined may be said to be similar. Â® [This terra is here used in a more extended sense than in the present systems of natural history; but even as applied to the Linnsean genera the rule is affected by numerous exceptions of which a comparison of the vesiculse seminales of the ape with those of the human subject affords a striking example.]

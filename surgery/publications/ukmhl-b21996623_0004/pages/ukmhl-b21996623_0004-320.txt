264 CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. This difference in the length of muscular fibres is a principal reason of the difference in the outlijie of most men from one another; it is at least a secondary cause, and should be particularly attended to by painters and sculptors, as it is a distinguishing mark between original nations. The contraction of a muscular fibre is produced by the following causes : simple mechanical pressure, as touch, the pricking of a pin, &c.; simple impression on another part which acts upon this by sympathy. It is also produced by properties of matter which are not mechanical, as the essential oils, salts, acids, &c.; by affections of the mind and in- tentions of the will by means of the nerves ; by the circumstances of the body itself at the time, as want, repletion, &c.; and even by death itself. â€¢ An animal that dies so slowly as to allow the stimulus of death to be felt by its muscles, has those muscles so contracted as to become stiff; whether this contraction is equal to the greatest power of contraction of the same muscle, in such a position of the parts in the living body, I do not know. In order, however, to ascertain how much a common muscle contracts from the stimulus of death, I cut out a muscle from a horse just after it was killed, and found that in the action of death it had contracted one third, and that the muscle so contracted had become one fourth thicker in its diameter, a proportion I believe it would have kept in the living body ; also the same muscle, when stretched, or when put into what in the living may body be called the relaxed state, did not again contract. The contraction of mucles from the stimulus of death is a stronger contraction than the attraction of cohesion of the muscles themselves; therefore when a muscle so contracted is attempted to be elongated it generally tears asunder: but this is not always the case, it only takes place under certain circumstances; it is with respect to the muscle it- self in proportion to the power of contraction of the muscle, for we find it takes place much oftener in those that die of violent deaths, especially when they die of strong convulsions; it seldom or ever takes place in those which die of a disease of some standing, for in them the muscles have lost in some degree their absolute power of contraction; as also the disease may be such as has in some degree destroyed the stimulus of death upon the muscles, so that their contraction will be less, although their power may be pretty strong. It would appear from the above that muscular contraction is not simply an approximation of the parts of which a muscular fibre is com- posed. What the difference is in a muscular fibre between its relaxed state and the contracted, perhaps may never be known.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLACENTA. 73 visible, but too small to be injected; I cannot therefore say how they terminated in the placenta. The principal veins arose in general from the fissures beginning from the surface, as in the human placenta; but besides these, there were other small ones; all which, we may suppose, pass through the decidua and enter the substance of the uterus, most probably in the same way as in the human subject. The membranes are the amnios, the chorion, and the membrana de- cidua. These appear to be much the same as in the human, except that the decidua is considerably thicker, especially where it passes between the uterus and the placenta. The navel-string in the monkey is not proportionally so long as in the human, and is very much and very regularly twisted. There is no urachus, and of course no allantois; not even the small ligament that appears to be a drawing-in of the bladder at its attach- ment to the navel, the bladder here being rounded.

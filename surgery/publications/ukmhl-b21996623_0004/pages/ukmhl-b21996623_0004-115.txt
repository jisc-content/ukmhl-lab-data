THE FIRST MONTH OF PREGNANCY. 59 attached in the uterus, has invariably presented a ti'anslucency and delicacy'of its mem- branes, with which the structure of the human ovum, as described by Home, is totally at variance; and, from the tenour of the whole account, we believe the object to have been what Mr. Bauer, to whom its description and delineation were confided^, declared it to resemble, viz. the egg of an insect. Rejecting, then, the description we have just been considering,—and its apocryphal character is rightly admitted by all physiologists of the present day, who have investi- gated the nature of the mammiferous ovum,—the determination of the period of the passage of the human ovum into the uterus after impregnation, and its condition and structure when first received into that cavity, still remain open to the researches of the physiologist] ^ “ As the ovum was so extremely small as to admit of dispute whether it was one or not, I carried it immediately to Kew, to Mr. Bauer, who, after examining it, said it looked like the egg of an insect”—Phil. Trans., p. 255. Mr. Clift, who laid open the uterus in question, and patiently scrutinized the whole of its cavity without perceiving any trace of an ovum, has always been of opinion that the one afterwards detected by Home was dropped from one of the numerous flesh-flies which were buzzing about at the time of the examination.

XIX PREFACE. track of inquiry, and perceived the governing principle or idea, which, more clearly appreciated and steadily retained by Sir Charles Bell, has since led to such important improvements in this department of physiology. Hunter premises his description of the nerves which supply the organ of smelling by calling attention to the constancy which pervades the anatomical conditions of the nerves, and states in general his belief that particular nerves have par- ticular functions, in relation to their differences of origin, union, and distribution* ; but this simple enunciation, with- out the proofs and illustrations of which it was susceptible, became unproductive of its proper results, and appears to have been subsequently lost sight of by Hunter himself, when speculating on the nerves as internuntiate conductors of a ma- term vitae diffusa, A knowledge of Hunterâ€™s opinions on the nervous system, derived only from the observations on that subject which occur in the Treatise on the Blood, might lead to the belief that he attributed to all the different nerves one common function; but after perusing the distinct exposition of his views on this branch of physiology as recorded in the Animal GEconomy, it appears to me that Hunter needed only to have resorted to experiment in this, as he did so successfully in other fields of physiological inquiry, to have established the nature and degree of the func- tional differences of these nerves, of which he describes the anatomical conditions giving rise, as he supposes, to those dif- ferences. He limits himself, however, in his illustration of the grand proposition, by anatomical examples only. He shows that or- gans like the eye and nose, which are endowed by means of one nerve with a special sense, derive their ordinary sensation from a second nerve having a different origin. This nerve he deter- mines, in the case of the eye and nose, to be the fifth pair. He says the same mode of reasoning is equally applicable to the organ of taste, and he traces the corresponding superadded nerve to the ear. Hunter further distinguishes the sensations of the stomach * pp. 187, 188. h2

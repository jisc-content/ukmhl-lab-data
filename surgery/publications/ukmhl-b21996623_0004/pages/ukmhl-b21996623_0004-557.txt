Structure of irritable intumescence of leafstalk, 204, note. Mirabilis, 201. Monotremata (povos, unicus ; rprjpa, foramen,); an order of ovoviviparous mammalia, so called, because in them the faeces, urine, and generative products are expelled by one and the same foramen, 6. Monro, Prof. A.; argues against lymphatic absorption, from supposed absence of lym- phatics in oviparous animals, 308. Monstrous appearances', definition of, 44. Classification of, i5., note. Not a matter of mere chance, 45. Their cause lies in the original germ, ib. Mule', its occasional fertility conjectured to depend on a monstrous condition of its ge- nerative organs, 319. Mullet', description of its gizzard, which is lined with cuticle, 129, and note. Muscles ; microscopic structure of voluntary and involuntary fibre, 260, note.

Contrac- tility of muscular fibre known to Lycus of Macedon and Herophilus, 195, note. Self- motion most conspicuous in animals, but exists in vegetables, 196. Three kinds of self-motion, 197, 199. Muscles act by vibration, 207. Vibrations longer as muscle is weaker, 208. Contraction of, stronger than their mechanical resistance in dead body, 267. Four kinds of stimulus to the contraction of, 210. Causes of contraction of, 264. Actions of involuntary muscles never tire, 211. Nor involuntary actions of voluntary, 212. Sensation of fatigue is therefore in the mind or nerves, though re-

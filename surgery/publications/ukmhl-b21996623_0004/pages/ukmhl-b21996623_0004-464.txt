We here approach to that veil of nature which man cannot remove. This, however, we know, that from infinite division of parts infinite surface may arise, and even our gross optics tell us that those singular organs, so often mentioned, consist like our electric batteries of many vessels, call them cylinders or hexagonal prisms, whose superficies taken together furnish a con- siderable area. â€¢

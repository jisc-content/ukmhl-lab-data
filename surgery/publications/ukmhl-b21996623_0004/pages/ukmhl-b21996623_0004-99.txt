43 OF THE FREE-MARTIN. On the posterior surface of the bladder, or between the uterus and bladder, were the two bags, called vesiculse seminales in the male, but much smaller than what they are in the bull; the ducts opened along with the vasa deferentia. This was more entitled to the name of herm- aphrodite than the first or third, for it had a mixture of all the parts, though all were imperfect. Mr. Wells's Free-Martin. This animal was between three and four years old when killed; and had never been observed to show any signs of desire for the male, al- though it went constantly with one; and looked more like a heifer than free-martins usually do. The teats and udder were small compared with those of a heifer, but rather larger than in either of the former examples; the beginning of the vagina was similar to that of the cow, but soon terminated a little beyond the opening of the urethra, as in the first-described. The va- gina and uterus, to external appearance, were continued, although not pervious, and the uterine part divided into two horns, at the end of which were the ovaria. I could not observe in this animal any other body which I could sup- pose to be the testicle. There was on the side of the uterus an interrupted vas deferens broken off in several places. Behind the bladder, or between that and the vagina, were the bags called vesiculse seminales, between which were the terminations of the two vasa deferentia. The ducts of the bags, and the vasa deferentia, opened as in the last instance. This could not be called an exact mixture of all the parts of both sexes, for here was no appearance of testicles. The female parts were imperfect, and there was the addition of part of the vasa deferentia, and the bags called vesiculae seminales. This circumstance of having no testicles, perhaps, was the reason why it had more the external appearance of a heifer than what they com- monly have, and more than either of the two former.

THE NERVES OF THE ORGAN OF SMELLING. 187 A DESCRIPTION OF THE NERVES WHICH SUPPLY THE ORGAN OF SMELLING. The nerves being in themselves perhaps the most difficult parts of an animal body to dissect, becomes a reason why we are still unacquainted with many of their minuter ramifications ; yet if a knowledge of these, together with that of their origin, union, and reunion, is at all con- nected with their physiology, the more accurately they are investigated the more perfectly will the functions of the nerves be understood. I have no doubt, if their physiology was sufficiently known, that we should find the distribution and complication of nerves so immediately connected with their particular uses, as readily to explain many of those peculiarities for w'hich it is now so difficult to account. What naturally leads to this opinion is, the origins and number of nerves being con- stantly the same, and particular nerves being invariably destined for particular parts, of which the fourth and sixth pair of nerves are re- markable instances. We may therefore reasonably conclude, that to every part is allotted its particular branch, and that however complicated the distribution may be, the complication is always regular. There are some nerves which have a peculiarity in their course, as the recurrent and chorda tympani; and others which are appropriated to particular sensations, as those which go to four of the organs of sense, seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting; and some parts of the body having peculiar sensations (as the stomach and penis), we may, without impropriety, include the fifth, or sense of feeling. This general uni- formity in course, connexion, and distribution, Avill lead us to suppose that there may be some other purpose to be answered than mere me- chanical convenience; and many of the variations which have been de- scribed in the dissections of nerves, I believe to have arisen from the blunders of the anatomist, rather than from any irregularity in their number, mode of ramifying, course, distribution, or connexion* with each other. â€¢ We observe no such uniformity in vessels carrying fluids, but find par- ticular purposes answered by varying their origin and distribution: the pulmonary artery answers a very different purpose in the circulation of * Here it is to be understood I do not mean lateral connexion, such as two branches uniting into one chord and then dividing; or a branch going to a part, either single or double, for still it is the same nerve; or whether a branch unites with another a little

CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. 243 Arise from the multiplication of the parts of the machine, and not from the increased number of powers. But an animal is composed of parts, each part, and each motion of each part, having its own moving power, capable of producing its im- mediate and remote effects independent of each other; so that in animals many effects may be going on at one and the same time, and each ac- tuated by its own peculiar power, by which means an innumerable va- riety of effects are carried on at the same time, and without the least confusion or interference with each other. A muscle, as to itself, may be considered in two lights, one respecting its quantity of contraction, and the other its power, both of which pro- duce considerable effects in the body, and each is employed according to circumstances. Every muscle in an animal body may be considered as a simple in- dependent power; and if we attend to the effects that many animals are capable of producing, particularly the motion of fishes and the flight of birds, we shall see great reason to admire the immense velocity and great force with which their muscles are contracted; and if we compare the effects produced by the contraction of their muscles with the weight of each muscle and the part which is to move, it may lead us to con- clude that there probably is not in nature a more active simple power than the contraction of the animal muscles. An animal is perhaps the only machine that has the power of overcoming its own gravity. In considering animal bodies in general in a mechanical light, w'e -should first attend to the most simple mode of action in the animal, or the mode of action of the muscles in the most simple animal, and pro- ceed from the most simple to the most compound or complicated, in which latter may be discovered applications and combinations of the several mechanical powers (which for beauty, simplicity, regularity, and aptness far excel all human applications), in order to produce the ma- nifold effects of animal motion, and to accommodate the ultimate velocity or force at the same time to the particular effects to be produced, as well as to the simple power of contraction in the several muscles which act as first movers in producing that effect. In many animals the parts endowed with the first principles of motion, viz., the muscular fibres, are themselves formed in various shapes, so as to constitute complete animals of the most simple fibres; and even in the most complicated animal many distinct parts are composed of those moving powers, forming regular bodies, called organs, commonly pro- ducing of themselves a vast variety of effects, by which means many of the numberless internal actions respecting the animal oeconomy are car- ried on; so that even in those more complicated animals we have the r2

194 OF SOME BRANCHES OF THE FIFTH PAIR OF NERVES. and there divides into two branches; one of which passes down along with the carotid artery, through the basis of the skull, and proceeding in a direction contrary to the course of the artery, in contact with that branch of the cervical ganglion that passes up with the carotid artery to join the sixth pair, then joins the first cervical ganglion. The other branch decussates that artery on its upper surface, and getting upon the anterior side of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, enters a small hole near the bottom of that large one which affords a passage to the seventh pair of nerves, joining the portio dura just where that nerve, making its first turn, passes along with it through what is called the aqueduct. This nerve, composed of portio dura, and the branch of the fifth pair, sends off, in the adult, the chorda tympani before its exit from the skull; and in the foetus immediately after. The termination of the branch, called chorda tympani, I shall not describe; yet I am almost certain it is not a branch of the seventh pair of nerves, but the last-described branch from the fifth pair; for I think I have been able to separate this branch from the portio dura, and have found it lead to the chorda tympani; perhaps it is continued into it; but this is a point very difficult to determine, as the portio dura is a compact nerve, and not so fasciculated as some others are. However this may be, it is very reasonable to suppose that the chorda tympani is a branch of the fifth pair, as it goes to join another branch arising from the same trunk Â® [This is a point which it is undoubtedly very difficult to decide by dissection of the paris in the human body. Cloquet, Hirzel, and Majendie describe the chorda tympani according to the supposition of Hunter. In the horse and calf, however, where the portio dura is less dense in its structure, the Vidian branch of the fifth may be di- stinctly seen crossing that nerve after penetrating its sheath, and separating into many filaments, with which filaments of the seventh nerve are blended, and a ganglion formed by the superaddition of gray matter; the chorda tympani is here continued partly from this ganglion, partly from the seventh or portio dura.]

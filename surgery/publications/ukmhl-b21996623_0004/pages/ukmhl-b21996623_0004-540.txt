484 DESCRIPTIONS OF SOxME ANIMALS that to which which it is annexed, having no allusion to anything else, for when it has it divides the idea. This observation applies particularly to the animals which have come from New Holland; they are, upon the whole, like no other that we yet know of, but as they have parts in some respects similar to others, names will naturally be given to them expressive of those similarities, which has already taken place ; for in- stance, one is called the kangaroo rat, but which should not be called either kangaroo or rat; I have therefore adopted such names as can only be appropriated to each particular animal, conveying no other idea Animals admit of being divided into great classes, but will not so di- * [The evils of implying false affinities and of suppressing differences of primary importance, which would have resulted from referring the newly discovered quadrupeds of Australia to the known Linnsean genera, as was afterwards done by Dr. Shaw, were sagaciously avoided by Hunter. And had the same expanded views been taken by his colleague, zoology would not at the present time have been burdened with such useless synonyms as Didelphys petaurus, Didelphys 2)cnicillata, Bidelphys viverrina, Didelpthys ohesula, &c., and the zoologists of the continent might have been spared the task of rectifying the errors of that arrangement, which arising from an ignorance of the anatomical distinctions of the animals in question, and from a disregard of the mo- difications presented by their teeth and locomotive extremities, consisted in grouping with the American opossums the species above quoted,—species which now form respect- ively the types of the genera Petaurus, Phascogale, Dasyurus and Perameles. Hunter, on the contrary, adopted the more natural and philosophical method of accurately pointing out the differences and resemblances of each species, retaining for them, like Adanson with reference to the nondescripts of Senegal, the native names, instead of applying to them Linnsean generic appellatives, which could only serve to propagate erroneous ideas of the objects to which they were attached. These reflections are so obviously suggested by the text, that the following is offered as an apology for their insertion: the writer of a volume entitled a “ Discourse on the Study of Natural His- toiy”, wliich by some unfortunate casualty has appeared in the same series of publica- tions as that which contains Herschel’s admirable Discourse on Natural Philosophy, introduces the name of John Hunter in his account of the naturalists who have con- tributed to the rise and progress of zoology for the sole purpose of instituting a dis- paraging comparison between that great and original thinker and the author of the General Zoology. “Dr. Shaw”, Mr. Swainson observes, “ was unquestionably the writer of nearly all the zoological descriptions in White’s Voyage to New South Wales, whereas he (John Hunter) merely wrote the account of five of the quadrupeds and these are neither named nor scientifically characterized.” Now the fact is that Hunter’s descriptions of the parts best adapted for zoological characters are so exact and so minute that a zoologist has no difficulty in assigning the species to the most recent zoological subdivisions, as any one may convince him- self who compares the account of the Tapao Tafa with the characters assigned by Tem- minck to his genus Phascogale.. But Hunter added also observations on the differences and peculiarities of the internal structure of the marsupial quadrupeds, yet Dr, Shaw was so blind to the true methods of advancing the science of zoology, and so little able to appreciate the labours of his colleague to this end, that science was de- prived of the benefit of Hunter’s anatomical description of five marsupial genera, be- cause they were, in Dr. Shaw’s estimation, little calculated for the readers of a zoolo- gical appendix !J

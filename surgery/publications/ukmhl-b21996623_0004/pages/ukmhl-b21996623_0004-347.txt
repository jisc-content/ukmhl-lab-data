But there is no eye behind the retina to view in the same manner the image which is thrown upon that membrane. It is w^ell known that the retina is incapable of trans- mitting a distinct idea of any spectrum depicted upon it save of that which is situated in or near its axis: the colours of the lateral pencils cannot be seen, and hence it is of no importance wdiatever to render the image achromatic at a distance from the axis. When we wish to examine an object, or a part of an object, with minute attention, w^e direct to it the axis of the eye; and in order to obtain a sensibly colourless vision in or near the axis aehromatic compensation is not necessary. It is no doubt true that even in this axis there is a non-coincidence of the foci of the differently-coloured rays; but owing to the shortness of the focal distance of the eye, and the low dispersive power of the humours, this non-coincidcnce of the different foci does no injury to our ordinary vision.] u2

CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. 205 is its increased thickness and uniformity of surface, upon cutting the footstalk longitudinally, as also the stem on which it stands through its whole length, the following appearanees may be observed^:— For the purpose of making my experiments I took three sensitive plants, having several others for any comparative experiments which might be thought necessary. I first pitched upon one leaf in each plant which was capable of the greatest motion of collapsing and erection; and behind each of these leaves a board was placed, on which was marked the greatest extent of the two motions, so that the leaf was like the index or radius of an arc. To have the greatest part of the day before me, I began my experi- ments at eight in the morning, while the leaves were in full expansion, and I continued them till four in the afternoon, as longer than this would not have been just, for they begin to collapse of themselves be- tween five and six o’clock.

With his usual sagacity, however, he rightly refers the motive power to this part, and it has been the subject of much diligent and minute investigation since these Croonian Lectures were read.]

162 ON THE HEAT OF VEGETABLES. ference, although small, shows a principle in life, all other things being equal; for as the same experiments were made on a dead tree, which stood with its roots in the ground, similar to the living ones, they be- came more conclusive. In October I began the experiments upon the walnut-tree when its powers of action were on the decline, and when it was going into its passive life. Exp. VI. October 18th, at half-past six in the morning, the atmo- sphere at 51-^°, the thermometer in the tree was at 55^®; but, on with- drawing and exposing it for a few minutes in the common atmosphere, it fell to 50-^°. Exp. VII. October 21st, seven o’clock in the morning, the atmo- sphere at 41", the tree at 47". Exp. VIII. October 21st, in the evening at five o’clock, the atmo- sphere at 51-^", the tree at 57". Exp. IX. October 22nd, at seven in the morning, the atmosphere at 42", the tree at 48". Exp. X. October 22nd, one o’clock afternoon, the atmosphere at 51", the tree at 53". Exp. XI. October 23rd, in the evening of a wet day, the atmosphere at 46", the tree at 48", Exp.XII. October 28th, a dry day, the atmosphere at45", the tree at 4 6", Exp. XIII. October 29th, a fine day, the atmosphere at 45", the tree at 49". Exp. XIV. November 2nd, wind east, the atmosphere at 43", the tree at 43". Exp. XV. November 5th, wet day, the atmosphere at 43", the tree at 45". Exp. XVI. November 10th. Atmosphere at 49", the tree at 55". Exp. XVII. November 18th. Atmosphere at 42", the tree at 44". Exp. XVIII. November 20th, fine day, the atmosphere at 40", the tree at 42". Exp. XIX. December 2nd. The atmosphere at 54", the tree at 54". In all these experiments, which were made at various times in the day, viz. in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, the tree was in some degree warmer than the atmosphere, excepting in one, when their temperatures were equal. For the sake of brevity, I have drawn up my other experiments (which were made on different trees) into four tables, as they were made at four different degrees of heat of the atmosphere, including those made in the time of the very hard frost in the winter of 1775-6. They were as follows :

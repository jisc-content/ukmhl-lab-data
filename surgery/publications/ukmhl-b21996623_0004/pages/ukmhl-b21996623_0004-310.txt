In both cases the elastic power produces this necessary elFect, and it seems to follow hence that this power must always be proportionally greater in the larger vessels than in the smaller ones. ** A Table, exhibiting at one view the results of the above-mentioned experiments concludes this lecture^.” ® [The irritability, or muscularity, of part of the coats of the artery contended for in the preceding lecture by Hunter, has since been demonstrated experimentally, first, by Dr. John Thompson of Edinburgh, and subsequently by many other physiologists; in whose experiments distinct contraction of the small arteries was produced, not only by mechanical (Wilson Philip, Hastings, Kaltenbrunner) but by galvanical irritation. (See Wiedemeyer, Expe.rinienta circa Statum Sanguinis et Vasorum in Injiammatione, Monachii, 4to, 1826, and the Bibliography of the Vascular System, vol. iii. p. 233.) The mus- cular action is easily seen by dropping water colder than the atmosphere upon the ca- pillaries in the mesentery of a frog, which thereupon contract both longitudinally and transversely, and after a little while restime their ordinary dimensions. Nevertheless the best chemists agree in classing the fibrous coat of arteries with the non-albuminous textures, as cellular tissue, cartilage, &c. (See note, vol. iii. p. 161.) The ultimate ■fibres of the middle coat, viewed microscopically, are smooth, branched, and anastomose reticularly, like the fibres of involuntary muscle; they present a remarkably clear dark outline.] t

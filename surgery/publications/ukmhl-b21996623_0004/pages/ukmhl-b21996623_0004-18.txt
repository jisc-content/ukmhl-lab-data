PREFACE. 11 leisure hours, without the slightest expectation of profit or honour, the experiment having only served to convince me of the difficulty of adding the observations demanded by the pro- gress of science to the text of Hunter in the spirit of its author, and a retrospect of my annotations leading me to suspect that often, with every wish to avoid it, I may have tacitly implied an ignorance on the part of Hunter of facts with which he was probably well acquainted, and to perceive that, in general, the addition of such details tends to overload and destroy the force of the original observations in the text. It is with much more satisfaction that I refer to the additions which have been made to the present edition of the Animal CEconomy of the hitherto uncollected or unpublished writings of its original author. These consist of the following essays. From the Philosophical Transactions : “ On the Anatomy of the Siren or Amphibious Bipes (1766).” “ On the Electric Organs of the Torpedo (1773).” ‘‘On the Electric Organs of the Gymnotus (1755).” “ Experiments and Observations on Vegetables with respect to the power of producing Heat (1775).” “ A case of Smalbpox communicated by the Mother to the Foetus (1780).” “ Anatomical Remarks on a New Marine Animal (1785).” “ Observations on the Structure and CEconomy of Whales (1787).” “ On Bees (1792).” “ On the Fibrous Structure of the Crystalline Lens (1793).” “ On the Fossil Bones of the Caverns of Gailenreuth (1794).” “ Six Croonian Lectures read before the Royal Society by Hunter in the years 1776, 1777, 1779, 1780, 1781 and 1782,” but withdrawn from publication by the Author. From the Medical Commentaries of Dr, Wm, Hunter: “ Experiments on Absorption by Veins.” From the Transactions of a Society for the Promotion of Me- dical and Chirurgical Knowledge, vol. ii. (1794): “ Description of the Human Uterus and Ovum in the First Month of Pregnancy.” “ Observations on the Growth of Bone.”

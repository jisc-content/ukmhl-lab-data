OBSERVATIONS ON SOME FOSSIL BONES. 480 many of the fossil bones which w ere the subject of his chemical experiments are still preserved in his museum (see Nos. 118—130, Physiological Series). When we turn from the perusal of this highly philosophical memoir to the notice of it in the Ossemens Fossils of Cuvier, w^e must suppose that it could have been but very imperfectly known to the great founder of oryctological science. In the chapter on the ‘ Ours Fossiles,’ Cuvier says : “ Le celdbre chirurgeon anglais, J. Hunter, dans un Memoire sur les os fossiles, qui rCa que lew analyse chimique pour objet, et qui est in- sere dans les Transactions Philosophiques, donne deux belles figures de cranes d’ours fossiles les meUlures qui aient paru j usque la, mais sans description detaillee, et en di- sant pour toute comparaison que les diflferentes tetes d’ows de cavemes different au- tant entre elles qu'elles different de fours polaire, et que toutes ces differences ne sur- passent point celles que Page peut produire dans les animaux carnassiers; assertion vague et meme erronee.”—Loc. cit., p. 236. A careful and candid perusal of Hunter’s Memoir would doubtless have exonerated the author from this charge in the mind of Cuvier, as it must do in that of every unprejudiced reader. But it would still afford a \ery inadequate notion of the extent to which Hunter had pursued his study of fossil remains. The interest that he took in them is shown by the frequent exhortations towards their collection in his letters to Jenner, and his collection at his decease included about 1050 specimens, of which there are 259 belonging to the vertebrate classes (including 70 specimens of fossil fishes, and 40 of reptiles), 116 cephalopods, 166 univalves, 143 bivalves, 35 Crustacea, 163 echinodermata, 109 zoophytes, and 50 fossil vegetable productions.]

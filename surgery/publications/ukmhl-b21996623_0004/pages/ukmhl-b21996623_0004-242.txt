OF AIR-CELLS IN BIRDS. 186 receptacles, and are affected equally and regularly by every motion of the sternum and ribs. third use, and one which Hunter inclines to admit, is that of rendering the whole body specifically lighter, in relation to the peculiar actions of flight. A diminu- tion of specific gravity must necessarily follow the desiccation of the marrow and other fluids in those spaces which are occupied with the air-cells, and by the rarefaction of the contained air by the heat of the body. In harmony with this view are the facts, not only that the quantity of air admitted into the system is in proportion to the gene- ral powers of flight, but also that in birds where the skeleton is only partially perme- ated by air, this is especially distributed to those members which are most employed in locomotion: thus, it is admitted into the wing-bones of the owl, but not into the femur 5 while in the ostrich the air penetrates to the femur, but not the humerus or other bones of the wing. I have already alluded to the secondary use which the air-cells may afford to some large and long-winged bii'ds, which, like the Argala, or the Frigate Bird, hover with a sailing motion for a long-continued period in the upper regions of the air, by diminish- ing the necessity for muscular exertion by the tendency of the distended air-cells to maintain the wings outstretched. Of the same adventitious character is the use finally suggested by Hunter to the air-receptacles, of contributing to sustain the song of birds, and to impart to it tone and strength. It is no just objection to this function that the air-cells exist in birds which are not endowed with the mechanism and power of song, since it is not pretended that this is the primary or exclusive office of the air-cells. The latest writer on the pneumaticity of birds, M. Jacquemin, has indeed reproduced this suggestion of Hunterâ€™s as a novel idea.]

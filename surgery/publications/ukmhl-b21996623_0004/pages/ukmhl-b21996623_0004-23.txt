Vll PREFACE. It would be tedious to enumerate, name by name, the differ- ent species of animals whose organization was investigated and recorded by Hunter. Mr. Clift has evidence* that he left writ- ten descriptions, from autopsy, ing Mammalia: Of Quadrumana Carnivora . Rodentia Edentata Ruminantia . Pachydermata Cetacea Marsupiata . Of Birds Reptiles Fishes . Of Insects. of the anatomy of the follow- 21 Species. 51 20 5 15 10 6 10 84 Species. 25 19 29 Species. Of other invertebrate animals, as mollusca, red-blooded worms, and radiata, upwards of twenty. From the titles of manuscripts, therefore, it appears that Hunter possessed, at the period of his decease, original records of the dissections of three hundred and fifteen different species of animals. In addition to these. Hunter’s preparations testify that he had dissected twenty-three species of mammalia, sixteen spe- cies of birds, fourteen species of reptiles, forty species of fishes, forty-two different mollusca, and about sixty species of arti- culate and radiate animals ; all species of animals of whose ana- tomy we have no evidence that he left written descriptions. So that by adding these undescribed dissections to those of which we derive the evidence from the list of the manuscripts, and of which described dissections his anatomical collection in like manner contains evidences in the dissected and preserved organs, there is proof that Hunter anatomized at least five* hundred different species of animals, exclusive of repeated dis- sections of different individuals of the same species, besides the dissections of plants to a considerable amount.

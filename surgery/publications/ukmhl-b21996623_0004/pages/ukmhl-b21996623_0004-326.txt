270 CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. the resistance of the same muscle, or the resistance of any muscle in the same body. Another partial cause of strength in some animals is for catching their prey, which is to overcome a resistance considerably beyond the motion of the part itself which is to perform the action. If such parts of animals as are adapted for progressive motion, for fighting, or for catching prey, require the greatest strength in the muscle adapted for such purposes, and if we find that such parts as are endowed with the firmest muscles are the strongest, where all those purposes are united in the same part in any one animal, we must find there the greatest strength, and of course the firmest of all the muscles in the body, especiaUy if every one of these actions is considerable or violent. Thus, then, we find the muscles in the arm of a lion w'here all these three purposes are performed, are extremely firm in texture, and we must suppose are also exceedingly strong. The muscles of the thigh of a fighting-cock are employed in fighting and progressive motion, and are extremely firm. The muscle which has the greatest resistance in an animal body to overcome is the heart, especially in quadrupeds, and this is perhaps the firmest in the body, being even firmer than those which have the above- mentioned resistances to overcome; but the firmness of this muscle may in some measure arise from its action, which T called the second cause of firmness. Some muscles in the more imperfect animals are much firmer than others in the same animal; such is the muscle which draws the snail into its shell, and retains it there against almost any power that can be applied: also the muscle which shuts the two shells of the bivalve is very firm in its texture, and w^e know that it is exceedingly strong. A difference is sometimes found in firmness between the muscles of the male and female ; this, however, is not universal, not taking place in fish: but in all animals where the males have a disposition to fight and the females not, or at least in a less degree, I believe the muscles of the male are much firmer than those of the female, and this in pro- portion as their disposition for fighting is greater; therefore in beasts of prey, where the disposition to fight is nearly equal in the male and fe- male, the difference in strength is not so remarkable as in many other animals, there being very little difference between a male and female cat, a dog and bitch, a male and female hawk, &c.; but the muscles ap- propriated for catching prey, and also for fighting, are much firmer than the other muscles in the same body allotted for common purposes, and according to our reasoning they must be much stronger.

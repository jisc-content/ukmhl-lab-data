CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. 241 that such contraction will bring the point of insertion from C to G, and that the motion of the tendon will be to the contraction of the mus- cle as C G is to C F or C E ; for A G is equal to A E, and B G equal to B F, or A and B are the centres of the circles AGE and B G F. The advantage arising from this construction of muscle is great, as it allows of a great number of fibres in small bulk, and is therefore used where strength is required. It is also used where the quantity of mo- tion required is greater than the distance between the origin and inser- tion would admit of in any other construction of muscle.

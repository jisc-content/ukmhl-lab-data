OF THE SITUATION OF THE TESTIS IN THE FCETUS. 19 • with a lusus naturae of a peculiar kind, in the son of a man in this neighbourhood. The boy is about twelve months old : his right testicle is situated • about an inch below the termination of the scrotum, and half an inch on the right side of the centre of the rapha perinaei, where a kind of pouch is formed of the common integuments, without the least rugous or scrotal appearance on its surface. It is perfectly detached from the scrotum; nor can the testis or spermatic process be at any time felt in any part of the scrotum, though I can readily make the testis pass from its situation quite up into the groin ; but immediately upon removing my hand the testis falls down into its pouch; and I can trace the sper- matic chord from the body of the testis up to the ring, running about a fourth of an inch on the right side of the scrotum. The scrotum on each side appears perfectly formed, and the left testis is in situ naturali. Now, Sir, as I conceive this peculiar conformation may be attended with great inconvenience to the child when he comes to ride on horse- back, and on many other occasions, I beg leave to request your opinion upon it, with respect to what ought to be done to prevent accidents, which must, if left in its present situation, often occur. “ Burford, Oxfordshire.

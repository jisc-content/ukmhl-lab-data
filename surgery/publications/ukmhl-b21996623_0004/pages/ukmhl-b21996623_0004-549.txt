FROM NEW SOUTH WALES. 493 A Dingo, or Dog of New South Wales, This animal is a variety of the dog, and, like the shepherd’s dog in most countries, approaches near to the original of the species, which is the wolf; but is not so large, and does not stand so high on its legs. The ears are short and erect, the tail rather bushy ; the hair, which is of a reddish dun colour, is long and thick, but straight. It is capable of barking, although not so reaaily as the European dog, is very ill- natured and vicious, and snarls, howls, and moans like dogs in com- mon. Whether this is the only dog in New South Wales, and whether they have it in a wild state, is not mentioned, but I should be inclined to believe they had no other, in which case it will constitute the wolf of that country; and that which is domesticated is only the wdld dog tamed, without having yet produced a variety, as in some parts of America. « THE END.

232 CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION- membrane more closely to the muscles, by which means the skin may be in some measure moved by them. The fasciae in some instances give insertion to muscles, as in the thigh, and to the broad abdominal muscles. Attachment of Muscles to Tendons, As the body of a muscle is much thicker than the tendon to which it is attached, the fibres of the one cannot be continued to the other in a straight line ; therefore the end of the tendon is not joined to that of the muscle in one line, but by a tapering point or an irregular edge, to gain surface for the insertion of the muscular fibres, the oblique ending of a small body being capable of becoming equal to the less oblique end- ing of a thick one ; but the direction of the tendon cannot be the same with the muscular fibres, but must be more or less oblique, so that an angle must be formed at their union, the muscular fibres being bent a little in towards the tendinous ones. This obliquity in the direction of most of the muscular fibres, and of their attachments at both ends when they have tendons at both origin and insertion, makes the muscle be- come gradually thicker from the body of the first tendon to the most distant point of that tendon ; and if the middle part of the muscle is free from tendon, that part will be everywhere equal in size, or if the ten- don at its insertion goes higher than at its origin, the part where these tendons are opposite and parallel to one another will also be equal in size, the body of the muscle from that part becoming gradually smaller upwards towards its origin, and downwards to^vards its insertion. From such disposition of fibres the bodies of most muscles are much longer than their component fibres, which produces in the same propor- tion a shorter complete tendon. This circumstance lessens the thickness of the bodies of such muscles, and also of their extremities, which gives to the muscle a curve in its outer line. The obliquity in the direction of the muscular fibres admits of there being a greater number, and lengthens the swell in the time of contrac- tion, by which means the motion of the muscles in the cellular mem- brane becomes more free, the swell is smaller, and the smoothness of the whole body is preserved. The tendon at its origin is generally on one side, or surrounding the muscle, and the inserting tendon is on the opposite side, or next the centre of motion. Origin and Insertion of Muscles, In describing the origin and insertion of muscles the tendons are al- ways included, and this is very necessary to be understood of the inser-

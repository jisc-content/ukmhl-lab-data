ADVERTISEMENT To the Second Edition of the Animal (Economy^ 1792. Eleven of the following papers have been read at the Royal Society, and published in the Philosophical Trans- actions; but in a work of so general a nature^ and of w^hich physiological inquiries make so small a part, the few facts and observations which I have given upon such subjects may, probably, be overlooked by those who are not members of that Society. That they may be more easily procured by students in medicine, and other readers, I have, by an application to the President and Council of the Royal Society, obtained leave to reprint them, in this work, as being connected with the princi- ples and actions of the Animal (Economy; and I have added such observations and remarks as have occurred to me since the time they were read before the Royal Society.

ADVERTISEMENT To the First Edition of the Animal (Ecmiomy^ 1786. The nine following papers have been read at the Royal Society, and published in the Philosophical Transac- tions ; but in a work of so general a nature, and of which physiological inquiries make so small a part, the few facts and observations which I have given upon such subjects may probably be overlooked by those who are not members of that Society. That they may be more easily procured by students in medicine, and other readers, I have, by an application to the President and Council of the Royal Society, obtained leave to re- print such of them as I consider to be connected with the principles and actions of the Animal CEconomy; and I have added such observations and remarks as have occurred to me since the time they were read be- fore the Royal Society.

250 CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. air which makes the trunk as rigid and firm as possible to support or sustain the actions and motion of the extremity. If an action takes place in an extremity, where a considerable effect is to be produced, which can only be produced by a considerable velo- city, then the whole body gives it assistance so far as it is possible for it to do. If a man throws a stone, or a blacksmith swings his sledge-hammer, the whole body humours the action, and the fixed point is thrown to a greater distance than the setting-on of the arm : the whole moves from the loins, or perhaps lower. Those secondary actions are brought in as auxiliaries, and answer two very important purposes : they increase the quantity of action when necessary, and they assist in easing the immediate action, so as to allow of a continuance of it, by which means animals are capable of performing greater actions, with more ease, and a longer continuance. Muscles regulate the actions of others not only by their contraction but by their relaxation, which last is a kind of negative action. When a man walks I have already observed that there are many muscles acting as secondary agents in the body, so as to assist the immediate motions of the part to be moved; but, besides this, there are many of the same muscles that are gradually relaxing, so as to allow the alternate motions by imperceptible degrees to creep regularly into one another. Perhaps I cannot give a more striking idea of those primary and se- condary actions, with the relaxations, which I have called negative ac- tions, than to present to the minds of those who have some knowledge of the subject what must be going on with the muscles of a man ba- lancing himself on a slack or tight rope, when the first or immediate order of muscles are acting with their utmost force; where the second- ary are assisting in the secondary actions of the body, and as it were playing into the hands of the first; where others again are relaxing in proportion as the first and second are acting; and where the entirely relaxed are waiting the opportunity to act, when called upon by any change that shall take place in the position of the body, which in such circumstances is in a continued agitation.

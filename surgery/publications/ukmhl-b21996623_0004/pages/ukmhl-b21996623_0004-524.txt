ANATOMICAL REMARKS ON 468 with the tentacula arising from its sides, like the plume from the stem of a feather; and that this stem was drawn in or shortened by means of a muscle passing along the centre, which threw the tentacula into a spiral line, similar to the penises of many birds ; but how far this is really the case I have not been able to ascertain. The internal structure of this animal, like most of those which have tentacula, is very simple; it differs, however, materially from many, in having an anus, most animals of this tribe,, as the polypi, having only one opening, by which the food is received, and the excrementitious part of it also afterwards thrown out^. Tliis we might have supposed, from analogy, to take place in the animal which is here described, more particularly since it is inclosed in a hard shell, at the bottom of which there appears to be no outlet; but as there is an anus this cannot be the case. It is very singular that in the leech polypi, &c., where no apparent inconvenience can arise from having an anus, there is not one; while in this animal, where it would seem to be attended with many, we find one ; but there being no anus in the polypi, &c. may depend upon some circumstance in the animal ceconomy which we are at present not fully acquainted with. The univalves, whose bodies are under similar circumstances respect- ing the shell with this animal, have the intestine reflected back, and the anus by that means brought near to the external opening of the shell, the more readily to discharge the excrement; and although this structure in these animals appears to be solely intended to answer that purpose, yet when we find the same structure in the black snail, which has no shell, this reasoning will not wholly apply, and we must refer it to some other intention in the animal ceconomy In this animal we must therefore rest satisfied that the disadvan- tageous situation of the anus, with respect to the excrement’s being dis- charged from the shell, answers some purpose in the ceconomy of the animal which more than counterbalances the inconveniences produced by it. It would appear, from considering all the circumstances, that the ex- crement thrown out at the anus must pass from the tail along the inside of the tube, between it and the body of the animal, till it comes to the ® [This is not the case with those Polypi wliich have the tentacula beset with vi- bratile cilia, as the FlustrcB, Escharcb, Vesiculariacy &c., as in tliese there is a reflected intestinal canal, terminating by a distinct anus, opening near the mouth.] [In the leech the alimentary canal terminates by a minute anus, situated above the caudal sucker.] [The reflected disposition of the intestinal canal is, in a greater or less degree, common to all molluscous animals, and the anus is thus brought into communicatiou with the respiratory caAity.]

It is observable that both sows rather increased in their number each time as they grew older, although not uniformly; the difference between the first and last in both animals being considerable. From the above table we find that the sow with only one ovarium bred till she was six years old, from the latter end of 1779 till Septem- ber 1783, about four years, and in that time brought forth seventy-six pigs. The perfect animal bred till she was eight years of age; and if conception depended on the ovaria, we might have expected that she would bring forth double the number at each birth; or, if not, that she would continue breeding for double the time. We indeed find her pro- ducing ten more than double the number of the imperfect animal, al- though she had not double the number of farrows; but this may per- haps be explained by observing that the number of young increased as the female grew older, and the perfect sow continued to breed much longer than the other. From a circumstance mentioned in the course of this experiment it appears that the desire for the male continues after the power of breed- ing is exhausted in the female; and therefore does not altogether de- pend on the powers of the ovaria to propagate, although it may probably be influenced by the existence of such parts. If these observations should be considered as depending on a single experiment, from which alone it is not justifiable to draw conclusions, I have only to add that the difference in the number of pigs produced by each was greater than can be justly imputed to accident, and is a

ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE TORPEDO. 413 part of any animal with which I am acquainted, however strong and constant its natural actions may be, which has so great a proportion of nerves. If it be then probable that those nerves are not necessary for the purposes of sensation or action, may we not conclude that they are subservient to the formation, collection, or management of the electric fluid} especially as it appears evident, from Mr. Walshâ€™s experiments, that the will of the animal does absolutely control the electric powers of its body, which must depend on the energy of the nerves. How far this may be connected with the power of the nerves in gene- ral, or how far it may lead to an explanation of their operations, time and future discoveries alone can fully determine.

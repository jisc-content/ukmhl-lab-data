164 ON THE HEAT OF VEGETABLES. The same trees we mentioned when the thermometer was at 29°, in new holes made at the same height, and left some time pegged up till the heat produced by the gimlet was gone off; but in which, as they were moist from the sap, the heat could be very little, especially as the gimlet was not in the least heated by the operation.

I did not try to freeze the sap of the others. Now since the sap of a tree when taken out freezes at 32°; also, since the sap of a tree, when taken out of its proper canals, freezes when the heat of the tree is at 31°; and since the heat of the tree can be so low as 17° without freezing ; by what power are the juices of the tree, when in their proper canals, kept fluid in such a cold ? Is it the principle of vegetation ? Or is the sap inclosed in such a way as that the process of freezing cannot take place, which we find to be the case when water is confined in globular vessels ? If so, its confinement must be very different from the confinement of moisture in dead vegetables; but the circumstance of vegetables dying with the cold and then freez- ing appears to answer the last question. These, however, are questions which at present I shall not endeavour to solve. I have made several experiments upon the seeds of vegetables similar to those on the eggs of animals ; but as inserting them would draw out this paper to too great a length, I will reserve them for another.

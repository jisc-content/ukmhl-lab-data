ON THE COLOUR OF THE PIGMENTUM OF THE EYE. 285 throw the rays, which passed through the retina, back upon that mem- brane, in the same or nearl}’’ in the same place as that through which they originally came. The eye being a sphere, or approaching to that figure, makes it probable; but whether the curve is such as will reflect the rays exactly in the same direction is not so easily determined. If the curve be a true one, then the rays that are not obstructed in their return by the retina must pass forwards through the pupil, and, being refracted in their passage through the crystalline humour, will be sent out of the eye in the same lines in which they entered, and be thrown on the very object from whence they cam^; which seems to be in a great measure the case, if na e may judge by the degree of illumination in the cat’s eyes. If the rays reflected from the light part of the pig- mentum should not, in their return, strike exactly on the same points in the retina, through which they first passed, yet if they are thrown nearly on the same place it will be sufficient, for we know that our sensations are not capable of conveying to the mind mathematical ex- actness. And the same circumstance will be a sufficient answer, should it-be objected that the time lost in the passing and repassing of the rays may prevent distinct vision; for it is known that if an illumined body is made to move quickly in a circle, it will appear to the eye a circle of fire.

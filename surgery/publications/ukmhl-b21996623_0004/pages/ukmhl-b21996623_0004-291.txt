CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. 235 muscular fibres had been continued to the most distant end of the bone to be moved, the muscle must have been longer, and must have con- tracted more, to produce the same effect, which contraction must have taken a greater length of time^. Many muscles arise near to the centre of motion of the part to be moved, and are inserted at a considerable distance, as the deltoides. This also produces a great deal of motion in the part to be moved, with very little contraction of the muscle; for when the greatest quantity of motion is produced, the insertion has approached very little nearer the origin. This kind of insertion gives an advantage to the power of the muscle, which the other has not, viz, a much longer lever, and allows the mus- cles to communicate their strength to the moving parts more fully, al- though with less velocity; and being employed upon parts of consider- able extent, as the arm and leg, and generally upon the first joints of them, the effects upon the hand and foot are very considerable. In the formation of many parts of the body neatness is a principal object, as is visible, not only in the external form of the limb, but in the parts constructed for motion; as in the formation of the bones, and their situation with respect to one another, and the mode of removing the in- serted tendon (when too close to the centre of motion to produce a suf- ficient effect) a little further off, by means of little moveable bones called patellae or sesamoid bones, as in the knee, first joints of the thumb and great toe: and where this construction would be clumsy and inconve- nient, as in the fingers and lesser toes, the two tendons which are obliged to pass along these parts to their insertions at the second and third joints, are so disposed in their course, that the profundus, or one nearest to the bone, acts as a patella to the other, keeping it at a distance from the centre of motion equal to its own thickness; and the sublimis or upper one is obliged to split into two near its termination before it can be inserted into the second bone. The advantage gained by this con- struction is, that the tendon of the muscle employed in the greatest action is removed further from the centre of motion than it otherwise could be, and from which the other sustains no disadvantage. Ada2)tatw7i of Muscles to Joints. It is to be understood that the joints of an animal are fitted for mo- tion, and that their form, with the application of the muscle or power, are, in a natural state, so adapted to each other that the pow'er acts with the greatest advantage, and that any variation from the natural form or * [The extent of the space through which the bone is moved is also greatly increased by this arrangement, in comparison with the extent to which the muscle itself contracts.]

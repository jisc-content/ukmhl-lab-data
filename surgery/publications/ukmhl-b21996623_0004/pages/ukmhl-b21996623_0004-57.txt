A DISCOVERY in any art not only enriches that with which it is immediately connected, but elucidates all those to which it has any re- lation. The knowledge of the construction of a human body is essential to medicine, therefore every improvement in anatomy must throw ad- ditional light on that branch of science. These improvements strike more forcibly if they are on subjects quite new or little understood; and this effect is well illustrated by the advantages which pathology has derived from the discovery of the lymphatics being the' absorbent system; and likewise by that case of hernia, where the intestine lies in contact with the testicle; which has been perfectly explained by the discovery of the original seat of the testicle being in the abdomen. Several years before Haller’s Opuscula Pathologica were published, my brother informed me, that in examining the contents of the abdomen of a child, stillborn, about the seventh or eighth month, he found both the testicles lying in that cavity, and mentioned the observation with some degree of surprise. By this we are enabled to account for a cir- cumstance that sometimes happens in the scrotal hernia, as depending on the discovery that the testis is formed in the abdomen, and which we could never explain to our satisfaction till the publication of the Opuscula, to which Dr. Hunter alludes, (Commentaries, page 72,) in the following words: “ In the latter end of the year 1755, when I first had the pleasure of

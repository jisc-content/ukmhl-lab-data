PREFACE. xxxiv The animals of this class are by much the most perfect, whether sea or land. There is a gradation from the land to the sea animals, viz. otter, seal, hippopotamus, whale. “ The Second Class is confined to the Birds entirely. I do not know of any animal of this class but what has all the cha- racteristics of the bird. They vary less in any of their parts than the first class*. Lungs, attached to the ribs, that they may move with them; lungs perforated; membranous bags in the abdomen that receive air in respiration; something like a dia- phragm. Parts of generation, ova crustaceous; one oviduct; one penis, and that grooved; no bladder. Oviduct in the female, and penis with the vasa deferentia in the male, all open in the same cavity with the anus. ‘‘ Liver, divided into two lobes cyst-hepatic ducts. “ Organ of hearing, little external passage to the ear; mem- brana tympani convex externally, but one bone (ossicu- lum auditfis);^ no cochlea. Feathers ; wings ; two legs ; long neck ; bill; membrana nictitans; bursa Fabricii. ‘‘ There is none of this class that belong entirely to sea ani- mals ; but this class may be said to possess in some measure three elements, viz. air, earth, and water; but they live no more in the air than other animals, for it is only for their progressive motion. “ In the Third Class we shall find some parts similar to the second. The third class may be divided into two, for they are not exactly alike, but one seeni's to partake of the second and third ; as it were, made up of both. The first division of the third class, then, is the Lizard and Serpent kind. They have Heart, two auricles, one ventricle, two aortas which unite in the abdomen. “ Lungs, loose bags, which lie in the thorax and abdomen, only partially divided. No diaphragm. * So also Cuvier: “ De toutes les classes d'animaux, celle des oiseaux est la mikix characterisee, celle dont les especes se ressemblent le plus.”—Regne Anim., i. p. 310.

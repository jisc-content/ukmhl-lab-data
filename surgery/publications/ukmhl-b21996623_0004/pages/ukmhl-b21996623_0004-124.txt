68 ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLACENTA. In addition to what I have said about the connexion between the mother and child in natural cases, it is necessary to observe, that though the Hunterian Preparations, illustrative of the structure and connexions of the placenta, his observations on the obscurity produced by apparently extravasated injection, led me to think of some less objectionable mode of demonstrating the vascular communi- cation between the uterus and placenta, if it existed; or of proving, more satisfactorily than the appearances pointed out by him in the Hunterian preparations seemed to do, that there was no such communication. This I proposed to do by dissecting the parts under water before disturbing them, either by throwing forcibly foreign matter into the vessels, or by separating the placenta from the uterus, to observe the appearances presented by the opposed surfaces; a pro- ceeding which, if done in the air, is liable to the objection of the possibility of having torn the vessels which were passing across, and the coats of which are acknowledged to be extremely delicate. For this purpose I was furnished by Dr. Lee with sections of an uninjected and na- turally connected uterus and placenta, at the sixth month of uterine gestation, which I fixed under water in an apparatus used for dissecting mollusca, and commenced the dissection from the outside, removing successively, and with great care, the layers fibres, and tracing the veins as they passed deeper and deeper in the substance of the uterus in their course to the deciduous membrane; in which situation, as the thinnest pellicle of membrane is rendered distinct by being supported in the ambient fluid, I naturally expected to see the coats of the veins continued into the deciduous mem- brane and placenta, and to be able to preserve the appearance in a preparation, if it actu- ally existed in nature. Every vein, however, when traced to the inner surface of the uterus, appeared to terminate in an open mouth on that aspect; the peripheral portion of the coat of the vein, or that next the uterus, ending in a well-defined and smooth semicircular margin, the central part adhering to, and being continuous with, the decidua. In the course of this dissection I observed that where the veins of different planes communicated with each other, in the substance of the walls of the uterus, the central portion of the parietes of the superficial vein invariably projected in a semilunar form into the deeper-seated one ; and where (as was frequently the case, and especially at the point of termination on the inner surface,) two, or even three, of these wide venous channels communicated with a deeper sinus at the same point, the semilunar edges de- cussated each other so as to allow only a very small part of the deep-seated vein to be seen. It need scarcely be observed how admirably this structure â€™s adapted to ensure the arrest of the current of blood through these passages, upon the contraction of the muscular fibres with which they are everywhere immediately surrounded.^^,- On another portion of the same uterus and placenta, I commenced the examination under water by turning off the placenta and deciduous membrane from the inner surface of the uterus. In this way the small tortuous uterine arteries which enter the deciduous membrane were readily distinguishable, though not filled with injected matter ; and, as it was an object to avoid unnecessary force in the process of separation, they were cut through, though they are easily torn from the decidua. But with respect to the veins, they invariably presented the same appearances as were noticed in the first dissection, terminating in open semicircular orifices, which are closed by the apposition of the de- ciduous membrane and placenta. This membrane is, however, thinner opposite these orifices than elsewhere, and in some places appeared to he wanting, or, adhering to the vein, was torn up with it; but in these cases the minute vessels of the placenta only

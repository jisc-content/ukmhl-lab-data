OF AN EXTRAORDINARY PHEASANT. 47 relates to the organs of generation, which can only be in those who have external parts; and that towards the age of maturity the discrimi- nating changes before mentioned begin to appear; the male then losing that resemblance he had to the female in various secondary properties *; but that in all animals which are not of any distinct sex, called herma- phrodites, there is no such alteration taking place in their form when they arrive at that age. It is evidently the male which at this time in such respects recedes from the female, every female being at the age of maturity more like the young of the same species than the male is ob- served to be; and if the male is deprived of his testes when young, he retains more of the original youthful form, and therefore more resem- bles the female. From hence it might be supposed that the female character contains more truly the specific properties of the animal than the male; but the character of every animal is that which is marked by the properties com- mon to both sexes, which are found in a natural hermaphrodite, as in a snail, or in animals of neither sex, as the castrated male or spayed female. But where the sexes are separate, and the animals have two charac- ters, the one cannot more than the other be called the true, as the real distinguishing marks of each particular species, as has been mentioned above, are those common to both sexes, and which are likewise in the imnatural hermaphrodite. That these properties give the distinct cha- racter of such animals is evident, for the castrated male and the spayed female have both the same common properties; and when I treated of the free-martin, which is a monstrous hermaphrodite, I observed that it was more like the ox than the cow or bull; so that the marks charac- teristic of the species which are found in the animal of a double sex are imitated by depriving the individual of certain sexual parts, in conse- quence of which it retains only the true properties of the species. They are curious facts in the natural history of animals, that by de- priving either sex of the true parts of generation, they shall seem to approach each other in appearances, and acquire a resemblance to the unnatural hermaphrodite. In some species of animals that have the secondary properties we have mentioned, there is a deviation from the general rules, by the perfect female, with respect to the parts of generation, assuming more or less the secondary character of the male This change does not appear to arise from any action produced at the first formation of the animal, and in this respect is similar to what takes * This is not common to all animals of distinct sexes, for in fishes there is no great difference; nor in many insects; nor in dogs, as has been already observed: however, it is considerable in many quadrupeds, but appears to be most so in birds.

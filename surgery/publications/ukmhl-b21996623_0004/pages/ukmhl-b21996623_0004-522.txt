OBSERVATIONS ON BEES. 466 How often they may breed in the same cell I do not know, but I have known them three times in the same season ; each time the excrement has been accumulating, and the cell has been lined three times with silk. From this account we must see that a cell in time will be so far filled up as to render it unfit for breeding. On separating the lining of silk, which is easiest done at the bottom, on account of the dried ex- crement between each lining, I have counted above twenty different linings in one cell, and found the cell about one quarter, or one third filled up ; when such a cell, or a piece of comb with such cells, is steeped in water, so as to soften the excrement between the linings, they are separated from each other at the bottom by the swelling of the excrement, so that they can be easily counted. A piece of comb so cir- cumstanced, when boiled for the wax, will keep its form, and the small quantity of wax is squeezed out of different parts as if squeezed out of a sponge, and runs together into the crevices; while a piece of comb, that never has been bred in, even of the same hive, melts almost wholly down. It is this wax that has the fine yellow, while the other of the same hives, although brown, yet shall be white when melted; so that I was led to imagine the wax took its tinge from the farina, excrement, &c., but upon boiling pure wax with such materials it was not tinged with this trans- parent yellow, only became dirty. In some of those cells that had pro- bably been bred in twenty times or more, when soaked so as to make the excrement swell, I have seen the bottom of the last lining rise even with the mouth, or top of the cell, so that the cavity of the cell was now full: in others, I have seen it rise higher than the mouth, so that the last- formed layers were almost inverted, and turned inside out. A piece of such comb, consisting of two rows of cells, is to be considered as a mould, and the lining of silk and the excrement as the cast; when this is boiled, so as either to extract all the wax or mould, or to destroy its original re- gular formation which constituted the comb, and nothing is left but the cells of silk, &c., they all easily separate from each other, being only so many casts, with the mould destroyed; and the bottoms, which were indented into each other, are very perfect. From the above account we must see that the combs of a hive can only last a certain number of years ; however, to make them last longer, the bees often add a little to the mouth of the cell, which is seldom done with wax alone, but with a mixture ; and they sometimes cover the silk lining of the last chrysalis; but all this makes such cells clumsy, in comparison to the original ones.

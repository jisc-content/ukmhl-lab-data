CROONIAN LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION. 201 The third kind of motion is from- external stimulus, and consists principally of the motion of whole parts, which is not inconsiderable in vegetables, as in the Dioncea muscipula and Mimosa pudica is very evi- dent ; for the first, upon being touched, closes up, and as it were con- fines the stimulating cause; the second bends its leaves, from external stimulus. This kind of motion is very strongly illustrated in the Tra~ gopogon. Calendula pluvialis, and many other plants, which shut up their flowers either towards night or when rain comes on; and in others of different genera which open in the evening, and shut up on the approach of the sun, as different species of the Convolvulus, Mirahilis, &c.; and in almost the whole class Diadelphia, which chiefly consists of the winged- leaved plants, which shut up their foliola towards night, not expanding them till morning, which is called by Linnaeus the sleep of plants; and in the motion of the footstalk of the leaf of an inverted plant, which twists so as to bring the surface of the leaf naturally uppermost to its natural position, which is remarkable in the vine, where there is evi- dently an apparatus for motion, although not a joint. These actions are similar to what arise in many animals from exter- nal stimulus, more especially those not endowed with sensation, and also to the actions of many parts of animals which do not appear to be directed or stimulated by the brain and nerves; as the actions of a polypus, which has no brain, and the peristaltic motion of the intestines in the more perfect animals, which does not arise from the stimulus of the brain and nerves^. rature, difference of light, the application of a chemical or mechanical stimulus; or, in an animal, loss of blood, &c. But whoever observes the actions of a living polype will see that although, for the most part, they may be traced to an external cause or stimu- lus, yet that one or more of the tentacula are occasionally extended or retracted with- out the slightest appreciable change in any of the external circumstances under which the animal exists. These motions evidently result from an internal impulse, and I would refer them to the presence, in the polype, of an organic element,— the nervous matter,—which is wanting in the vegetable ; even in that plant, which, from the energy of its excitability, has been erroneously called sensitive. There is also an essential dif- ference in the nature of the motion itself of the Mimosa and Hydra. If we touch one of the feelers of the polype it recedes from the irritant by a true contraction of the part within itself; which contraction appears to result from the injury experienced by that part of the nervous system which is disseminated through the feeler touched. In the case of the Sensitive plant there is nothing like that contraction of the part touched, but only an articular plication of the neighbouring part without any of the dimensions of the irritated leaf being altered.] ® [The more just comparison of the motions of plants adduced in the text would be with those automatic actions of whole parts which take place in animals, but which re- sult from the power possessed by the central axis of the nervous system, or any part of it, to transmit the action of an excitable nervous fibril to the exciting one with which that central axis or part brings it into communication: I apply the terms excitable and

130 ON THE GILLAROO-TROUT. The stomach of the common stream-trout is exactly of the same structure with that of the gillaroo; but its coat not so thick by two thirds*. How far this difference in thickness of stomach is sufficient to form a distinct species, or barely a variety of the same, is only to be determined by experiment f. The oesophagus in the trout is considerably longer and smaller than in many other classes of fish. The intestines are similar to those of the salmon, herring, sprat, &c. The pancreas is appendiculated. The teeth show them to be fish of prey. So far as we are led to determine by analogy, we must not consider the stomach of this fish as a gizzard, but as a true stomach. * The common stream-trout swallows shell-fish, and also pretty large smooth stones, which serve as a kind of shell-breakers. f Viz. take some gillaroo-trout, male and female, and put them into water in which there are no trout, to see if they continue the same*. ^ [They are considered to be varieties of the Sahno Fario, Linn., by the best modern naturalists: see Yarrell’s ‘ British Fishes,’ vol. ii. p. 57.]

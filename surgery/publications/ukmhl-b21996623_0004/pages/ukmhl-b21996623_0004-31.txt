XV PREFACE. searches on life ; and I would say, after a very careful study of the writings of Hunter, that of all physiologists he is one to whom a dogmatic theory of abstract life can least be attributed. But by those whose notions of Hunter’s doctrines are founded solely on a perusal of the posthumous “ Treatise on the Blood” lie is liable to be misconceived, and in opinions expressed from that limited acquaintance with his writings to be misrepresented. With the just ideas which Hunter had acquired of the laws of vitality and organic heat he was enabled to explain many of the phaenomena of digestion more satisfactorily than had been done by his predecessors Spallanzani and Reaumur. The following is a fair example of the different views and kinds of knowledge which these experimenters brought to the inquiry. Spallanzani had observed that digestion did not go on in rep- tiles below a certain temperature, he thought therefore that heat was necessary to assist in the dissolving processes of the sto- mach ; Hunter, in reference to the same fact, shows that the influence here is not merely chemical, but that the heat ope- rates by first raising the sensitive powers, these then transmit the stimulus to the respiratory and circulating functions, and lastly to the motive and other actions and faculties, and that the digestive organs are necessarily excited to corresponding ac- tions, in order to supply the waste occasioned by the working of the machine, which the heat has thus called into play. Hunter more accurately determined, and first applied and rendered fruitful, the fact which Grew incidentally mentions, viz. That it is the property of a living body or part to resist the action of the gastric juice ; and his celebrated paper “ On the Digestion of the Stomach after Death,” is a beautiful example of the application of his general views in physiology to the ex- planation of particular phaenomena. Of all his published writings, the papers on Digestion convey perhaps the best idea of the extent of Hunter’s researches in Comparative Anatomy, and of the soundness of his reason- ings in general physiology. Hunter’s claims to the originality of observations which have been reproduced as new by later physiologists, I have pointed out in the notes to these and other memoirs; and have parti-

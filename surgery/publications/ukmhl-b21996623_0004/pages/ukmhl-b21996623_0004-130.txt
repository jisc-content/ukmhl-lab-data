74 ACCOUNT OF A WOMAN WHO HAD ACCOUNT OF A WOMAN WHO HAD THE SMALLPOX - DURING PREGNANCY, AND WHO SEEMED TO HAVE COMMUNICATED THE SAME DISEASE TO THE FCETUS. . BY JOHN HUNTER, ESQ., F.R.S.^ Read January 17, 1780. Mr. Grantâ€™s Account. On the 5th of December, 1776, Mrs. Ford had been seized with shivering and the other common symptoms of fever, to which were added great difficulty of breathing and a very hard cough. Mr. Grant saw" her on the 7th, and he took from her eight ounces of blood, and gave her a composition of the saline mixture with spermaceti and magnesia every six hours. This had operated by the 8th two or three times very gently, when most of the complaints were relieved ; but the cough still shaking her violently, bleeding seemed necessary to be repeated, more particularly as she looked upon herself to be in the sixth month of her pregnancy. The medicine was continued without the magnesia. In the evening (viz. the 8th) the smallpox appeared, which proved of a mild kind, and moderate in quantity. Its progress was rather slower than might have been expected; but the woman passed through the disease in great spirits, sitting up the greatest part of the day during the whole time, and taking only a paregoric at night, and, as occasion required, a little magnesia; thus the symptoms were mitigated, and the cough at last became very little troublesome. On the 25th she complained of a pain in her side. Eight ounces of blood were taken away. The next day she was quite free from pain, and thought herself as well on the 27th as her particular situation would admit of; after which she was not visited by Mr. Grant till the 31st, when she was in labour. Mr. JVastalVs Letter on the same subject. December 30, 1776, I was sent for to Mrs. Ford, a healthy woman, about twenty-two years of age, who was pregnant with her first child. She had come out of the country about three months before. Soon [Originally published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. Ixx. 1780.]

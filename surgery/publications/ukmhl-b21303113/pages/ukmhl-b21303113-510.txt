SARCOMA AND CARCINOMA. 486 small. With respect to the etiology of carcinoma, the ascent of the curve alone can possess any accurate signification; it is otherwise with sarcoma. The mortality among the human race by no means increases after the age of forty so rapidly as the curve of the carcinoma sinks. We may well assume, therefore, that the dis- position to the formation of sarcoma absolutely decreases after the fortieth year of life. The result of this investigation may be formulated thus: Irritations, which in individuals previously disposed thereunto, lead to the formation of tumours, tend, during the first, three and up to the fourth decennium, principally to the formation of sarcoma, at a later period to that of carcinoma.

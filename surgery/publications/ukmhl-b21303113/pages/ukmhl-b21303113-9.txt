EDITOR’S PREFACE. The work, of which an abridged translation is contained in the following pages, consists of four volumes of Hospital Eeports, and relates to Professor BillrotlTs surgical experiences between the years i860 and 1876. The work in its entirety com- prises some eighteen hundred pages. To reduce this within the prescribed limits of the present volume has been the chief diffifculty of my task, and it has not been accomplished without sacrifice. I am conscious, indeed, that the original Eeports have been strangely altered in shape, not only by a sort of literary foreshortening, but further by the necessary process of collating the several volumes. A considerable amount of rearrangement was inevitable, but the general plan of the work has been adhered to. In the text I have usually indicated the volume from which the matter is translated. Thus, “ Z. B.” signifies the Eeports from the Zurich Hospital, and relates to experience between i860 and 1867 ; “ W. B.” stands for the Eeports from the General Hospital in Vienna between 1868 and 1876. The Introductions and Prefaces to the various volumes, though well worthy of perusal, have been uniformly omitted, for they would have been out of harmony with the work as altered. I felt less compunction in leaving out this portion of the work, for the greater part of these Introductions is occupied with the discussion of statistics. Now, the Statistical Tables, and with them many incidental remarks bearing on the subject, save those contained in Chapters XVIII and XIX have all been cut out. At first sight it might seem irrational to omit almost wholly a portion of the work to which the most prominent place is assigned by its author, and to l

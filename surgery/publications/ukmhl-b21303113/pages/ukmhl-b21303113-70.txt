46 EPITHELIOMA OF SCALP. Epithelioma originating in a cicatrix ; removal. Meningitis on the sixth day. Death. P. 0—, set. 33, a maid-servant, wlien a year old was severely burnt over the left temporal region. The cicatrix, which was about the size of the palm of the hand, did not heal up completely for two years. No bone came away. Three years and a half before her admission, the cicatrix began to ulcerate without obvious reason, at several isolated spots, and scabs formed. Very soon the ulceration spread over the entire cicatrix, and when the patient was first seen, the whole surface presented the appearance of a superficial epithelioma, which on removal it proved to be. The skull was not implicated. The ulcerated surface was removed, the incisions being carried wide of its limits, and separated from the bones with the raspatory. The surface was covered with dry charpie. After six days, most of the dressing was loosened by the suppuration and was removed with the forceps, fresh charpie being applied. The patient, who up till then had been entirely free from feverish symptoms, had a severe rigor on the following evening. The next day symptoms of meningitis developed ; paralysis of the right half of the body ensued with convulsions. She died sixteen days after the operation. Post mortem : “ puru- lent meningitis over the entire left hemisphere ; pus in the veins of the dura mater; the diploe corresponding to the seat of operation free from pus ; the brain superficially infiltrated with purulent matter. A small abscess in the left lung. No secondary cancerous deposits.” I have no doubt that in this case the infection was due to the changing of the charpie dressing.

CARBOLIC ACID POISONING. 16 their shoulders when I state the conclusions that I have arrived at after an experience extending over several years. Now the danger arising from carbolic-acid poisoning has only been properly appreciated during the last few years. At first, every one was carried away with enthusiasm at the wonderful suc- cess of the Listerian system; for my own part, I hesitated to ascribe the effects in many of the above-recorded cases to carbolic poisoning, fearing lest, in weighing these cases, I might be preju- diced by a mistrust of the antiseptic system, founded on theoretical grounds. I do not doubt that anaemia, childhood, old age, and weakly constitution are to be taken into consideration in forming a judgment. Although my mistrust of the antiseptic system begins to melt away in the face of successive favourable results, and I can now (from having seen more cases) take a wider view; yet there is no question in my mind that in all the instances given above, car- bolic poisoning decidedly caused death, though perhaps in some of the more weakly patients it merely sufficed to turn the scale. Not long ago, at a banquet in Vienna, Marion Sims spoke in highly flattering terms of our clinics and hospitals; in particular he found the mortality in the lying-in department so small that he said, “ It is no more mortality, it is accident ”—a graceful, well- meant, and consolatory remark, iVta wTspoevTa for the antiseptic enthusiasts ! It is to be regretted, however, that “ accident ” is so frequently fatal, that the term is almost convertible into “ mor- tality/’ See Appendix I, infra.

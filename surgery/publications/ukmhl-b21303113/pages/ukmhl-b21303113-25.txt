CHAPTER 1. ANTISEPTIC TREATMENT OP WOUNDS, AND ANAESTHETICS. In 1875, I first began to employ tbe antiseptic method regu- larly. In 1877, my assistant, Dr. Wolfler journeyed to England, Erance, and Germany, and brought back with him the most recent modifications of the method; whereupon we began afresh with our antiseptic treatment. The utmost precautions were taken to ensure asepticity, and to diminish the sources of infection. The time of making post-mortem examinations was altered ; none of the servants employed about the dead-house were allowed to come near the clinic or operating theatre; all my assistants were provided with special coats, which were washed daily; special, receptacles were set apart for the antiseptic dressings, and all the sponges were most carefully and thoroughly disinfected with carbolie acid and then soaked in thymol before use. I had long had an idea that some of the misfortunes met with after ovariotomy might be traced to imperfect disinfection of sponges. Professor Erisch has shown that sponges, even after they have been soaked for twenty-four hours in 5 per cent, carbolic solution, are still capable of developing organic germs. In short, in every detail, to the best of my power, I carried out Lister’s and Volkmann’s in- junctions. Unfortunately, to some extent, this system is based on imperfect scientific knowledge, and thus a certain amount of faith is demanded of those who obediently carry out every detail. In the beginning of 1878, the following form of antiseptic dressing was introduced into our clinic:—Two per cent, carbolic steam spray; all instruments, drainage-tubes, and silk soaked in 1

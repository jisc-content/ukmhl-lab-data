The patient slept off the effect of his debauch, and came up on the following day to the hospital. We then found that the left eyeball protruded to such an extent that it was entirely uncovered by the eyelid. Both eyelids were curled up inwardly, and lay behind the eyeball, which projected and was twisted downwards to some extent. Much blood was extravasated beneath the conjunctiva. A trace of movement in a vertical direction remained. All lateral movement was lost; vision was completely destroyed. No examination was made with the ophthal- moscope, or, at any rate, none is recorded. The condition clearly answered to that which has been termed iuxatio bulbi. An attempt to replace the eyeball into the orbit failed, for the outer and inner commissures were torn.

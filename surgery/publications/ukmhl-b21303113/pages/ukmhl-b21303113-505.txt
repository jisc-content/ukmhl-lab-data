DISTRIBUTION OF TUMOURS. 481 occurred in the face. This may be due to the fact that in the most common position of the head in utero, the venous circulation of the part is most liable to be interfered with; the resulting congestions may perhaps be the primary cause of these vascular growths. Eifty-one cases of adenoma (out of a total of 64) were broncho- celes. (The other 13 cases are entered as occurring in the abdomen and rectum.) Cystomata (353) were most common (95) in the female organs of generation, which is accounted for by the ovarian cystomata. Of 71 cases of cystoma in the neck, the majority were cystic bronchoceles. The 43 cystomata of the face include atheromata, cysts of the jaws and ranula. The 35 cystomata of the head were almost exclusively sebaceous. Of the 836 carcinomata, 406, or nearly one half, occurred in the face and the nasal or oral cavities; 253 were in the breast, 52 in the rectum, and 56 in the male organs of generation. The following table shows roughly the distribution of the tumours in the various tissues : In tlie cutis . . 499 7 „ mucous membranes 372) „ glands „ cellular tissue, fascia, fat . „ lymphatic glands „ muscular substance of tlie uterus „ nerves „ periosteum and boue 2058 This table shows that tissues composed of epithelium and con- nective tissue together are most prone to the formation of tumours. The large number of growths starting from the integuments (the cutis and mucous membranes) together (871), as opposed to the glands (642), finds an explanation in the fact that the integuments are far more exposed to such external irritations as are likely to set up abnormal growth. In the cutis (499) the carcinomata are especially numerous ; next in order of frequency come the angiomata (69), sarcomata (59)' cystomata (54, most of them being sebaceous). Of much rarer occurrence are fibromata (21). Tumours attacking the mucous membranes (373, among which 31 87 64 191- 249 17 10 78- 1 j '513=73' 51 per cent. 545=26-45 per cent.

SPINA BIFIDA. 189 Spina bifida. In the case of a child a few months old, the sac of the spina bifida had previously been tolerably tough and thick; the child had talipes equino- varus of the left and calcaneo-valgus of the right foot. Subsequently, large hydrocephalus formed; the skin over the spina bifida became very tense, translucent, and inflamed. Under antiseptics I laid open the sac, evacuated the fluid, and united the edges with sutures. Death followed five hours after the operation. I remember another case, where I encircled with a drainage tube a slender pedunculated spina bifida over the sacrum, then punctured the cyst, and injected diluted tincture of iodine. The child died of myelitis a few days later.

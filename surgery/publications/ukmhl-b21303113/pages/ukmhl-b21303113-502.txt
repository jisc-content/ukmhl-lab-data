478 FREQUENCY OF VARIOUS TUMOURS. disposed to tumour formations than that of Zurich. I think rather that the explanation lies in the fact that patients who had tumours were far less seldom sent away from the hospital in Vienna than those suffering from chronic inflammations. Of the latter class only a limited number could be admitted, owing to the long dura- tion of the diseases. lhe following table shows the frequency of the various forms of tumours :â€” Carcinoma .... 862 Lymphoma .... 261 Cystoma .... 253 Sarcoma . . . . 243 Fibroma . . . . 163 Angioma .... 101 Lipoma .... 66 Adenoma .... 64 Chondroma . . . . 17 Neuroma .... jo Osteoma .... 9 Papilloma .... 5 Echinococcus .... 2 2058 The order of frequency differs from that in ray Zurich tables (Z. B., p. 587 et seq.), because the classes of cystomata (which includes colloid cysts of the ovaries) and sarcomata were materially larger in Yienna. The total number of epithelial new formations (carcinoma, cystoma, adenoma)= 1179, or rather more than half of the total number of tumours (2058). It is interesting to note that these numbers almost exactly correspond with those of my Zurich tables. In a general statistical table of tumours, the preponderance of epi- thelial new formations would be far more marked, for a large number of uterine and gastric cancers would have to be added, while the number of connective-tissue new formations (fibroma, sarcoma, myoma, chondroma, osteoma) in the internal organs is certaiidy much smaller. With regard to the distribution of tumours between the sexes, I find that in Zurich there were more male (299) than female (259) patients. In the above table, the number of females (1037) is slightly larger than that of the males, a fact which is pro-

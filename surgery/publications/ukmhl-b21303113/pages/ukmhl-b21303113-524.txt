500 INTESTINAL ‘ RING SUTURES.’ sutures to unite the cut surfaces of the mucous membrane; still, I think it is as well to insert at least two or three, and thus to make sure that every part of the cut surface is covered over. This is of importance, for the gastric juice might attack the wounded surface if it were exposed. If it be desired to unite the mucous membrane on the anterior wall, the threads must be inserted from the outside before the Lembert’s sutures are passed through the serous coat. Gussenbauer and Czerny have already insisted on the importance of uniting, not only the serous surfaces, but also the edges of the wound. Fig. 28.—Gussenbauee’s Intes tinal Suture.

When all the sutures have been inserted and finally inspected, a sponge soaked in weak carbolic lotion is laid on the anterior surface of the stomach, and the abdominal walls are united in the ordinary way with lead button sutures, with a few ordinary sutures between them. When all the sutures had been inserted in the first case, we were not a little astonished at the excellent shape of the new-formed stomach (see Plate III, fig. 2), which was almost normal in appear- ance. The greater and lesser curvatures alone were somewhat flat- tened. In our second case, therefore, we saw no reason to alter the plan of attaching the duodenum to the lesser curvature. In consequence, however, of the immense dilatation of the stomach in this case, and the greater extent of the cancer, which rendered it necessary to modify the direction in which the duodenum was divided/ a diverticulum formed (Plate III, fig. 5 d), as will be described presently. Profiting by this experience the following plan was adopted in the third caseThe duodenum was attached (0 the

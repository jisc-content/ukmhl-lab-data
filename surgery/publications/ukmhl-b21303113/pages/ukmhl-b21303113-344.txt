Gunshot wound. A Polish refugee was wounded in a duel with pistols, the ball entering close behind the right trochanter; no aperture of exit. On exploring the track of the bullet with a catheter, it was found to lead by a devious track to the right edge of the sacrum; the bullet itself could not be felt. At first all went on well, but at the end of three weeks a deep abscess formed close to the left side of the sacrum. An incision was made, and a piece of cloth— part of the man’s trousers—extracted. A cavity could then be felt in the sacrum, but neither through the opening of the abscess, nor through the rectum, could the bullet bo felt. Profuse suppuration ensued, rigors, and death in the sixth week. Post-mortem : the bullet was found in front of the os sacrum, and the bones in the neighbourhood were carious; no metas- tatic abscesses.

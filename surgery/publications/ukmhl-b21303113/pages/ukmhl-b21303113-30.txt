The proper management of cases under the antiseptic system is the most difficult task I have ever attempted; still, this shall not deter me from doing my very best to perfect the system. Anesthetics. At the end of the year 1878, I had had a quarter of a century’s experience in operations ; more than six years as assistant, and the rest of the time in the charge of my own clinic. During this period I had seen chloroform administered some 6000 times, with two cases of death.1 Up to the end of 1870, I always employed chloroform alone as an anaesthetic: since then I have used a mixture, consisting of three parts of chloroform, one of sulphuric ether, and one of alcohol. With this anaesthetic X am perfectly well satisfied, and have not seen any asphyxia or syncope result from its use; the mixture seems to me merely of service in diluting the chloroform. My two assistant surgeons and my eight assistants undertake the post of chloroformist for a month at a time, in regular rotation. On this account, again, I think it more prudent to use diluted chloroform. No doubt the pure chloroform produces anaesthesia more rapidly than this mixture, but, on the other hand, the latter is less apt to excite vomiting. 1 Reported the ‘ Wien. Med.

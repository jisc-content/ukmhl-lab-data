96 ECHINOCOCCUS OB ORBIT. Echinococcus. A child, set. io, was brought to me with left exophthalmus, which had been gradually forming for two years. On admission, I found moderate congestion of the retina, vision much impaired, and diplopia. Fluctuation was perceptible in the tumour. The diagnosis, at first rather doubtful, was cleared up by puncture and the evacuation of some clear, non-albu- minous watery fluid. Rapid swelling followed with chemosis. An incision was made into the swelling, and a large white ecchinococcus sac extracted. The eyeball gradually resumed its natural position ; the suppuration was very slight. When the patient was discharged the diplopia still existed as before the operation. Fibroma of the clieclc. Case.—A strong man, aet. 41, was admitted with a tumour, the size of a large Fig. 6.—Soft Fibroma, probably originating in ttte Spheno-maxillary Fossa.

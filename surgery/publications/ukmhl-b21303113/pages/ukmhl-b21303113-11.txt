editor’s preface. VII For the above information I am indebted chiefly to the courtesy of Dr. Johann Mikulicz, of Vienna, assistant in Prof. Billroth’s clinic. An attempt to weave together materials collected from these various sources may possibly have produced something worse than mere patchwork, and have yielded a fabric unfit to stand the wear and tear of critical perusal. Of the scant justice that the present rather disjointed version does to the original volumes no one can be more conscious than myself. The task of editing the work would have been far harder had not the admirable arrangement and compilation materially lightened the labour. To the best of my power I have sought to remedy the defects arising from a rearrange- ment of the work by a copious index, by subdividing the chapters into sections, and by supplying full summaries at the head of each section and chapter. In this part of my task it is my pleasant duty to acknowledge material assistance from my friend Dr. C. de Lacy Lacy. I have not scrupled to make the translation in parts rather free. Where the differences in idiom and construction between two lan- guages are considerable, an attempt to reproduce too faithfully the original is apt to miss its mark. Sentences, which to those un- familiar with the original language might appear merely involved, are likely to become altogether incomprehensible if done too literally into another tongue. I have aimed solely at making the translation intelligible, and constantly borne in mind Voltaire’s warning : “ Malheur aux faiseurs de traductions litterales ! C’est la qu’on peut dire que la lettre tue ! ” London ; July, 1881. C. T. D.

510 CASES SUITABLE FOR EXCISION OF PYLORUS. the stomach, and cicatricial stenosis. In ulcer of the stomach, the operation will he especially indicated if the patient is unable to take any nourishment, or when the anaemia from the haemorrhage gives cause for much anxiety. It is known that ulcers of the stomach are generally situated on the lesser curvature and the pylorus. If on the pylorus, the operation will be like those already described ; if on the lesser curvature the wound of the stomach must be united longitudinally after the ulcer has been excised. This operation would only be difficult when the ulcer lies on the posterior wall of the stomach and is adherent—as it would be—to the pancreas. Can a cancer of the pylorus be radically and permanently extir- pated P The same questions arise here as with regard to the radical cure of cancer in general. As with other carcinomata, recurrence will certainly occur less often when the operation is performed early, the incisions carried wide of the cancer, and when every part that looks the least suspicious during the detachment of the omenta is removed.

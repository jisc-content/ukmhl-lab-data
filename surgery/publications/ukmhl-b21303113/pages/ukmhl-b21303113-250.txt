22G CANCER OF MALE BREAST. size o£ an egg. lie died of erysipelas, following operation for the removal of the tumour. Carcinoma of the leH breast and the axillary ylands. A. S—, set. 42, had lived from 1848 to 1859 in Siberia, during most of which time he had suffered from scurvy. In 1859 he succeeded in making his escape and he then lived in his native Poland, in comfort. In the Polish revolutionary wars of 1867 he received several wounds. As the result of a wound of the chest, he suffered for a long time from empyema. (The wound was close to the left nipple and the hullet was only extracted after several months.) He then lived in Berlin, subsequently in Paris, in which latter place he was operated upon by Goslin for a partial empyema. At the beginning of 1869 he noticed in the cicatrix in the left breast, and also in the left axilla, some small nodules, attended hy occasional severe, radiating pains. The small tumours increased slowly but steadily, up to the time of admission; at that time the growth in the breast was about the circumference of half-a-crown, and that in the axilla about the size of a small apple. The breast and the axillary tumour were removed at the end of 1870, and a month later he was discharged. The man came back to me three years later with some enlarged and indurated glands in the left axilla and severe pain down the left arm. The glands were removed. This was in 1873. I have not been able to learn the further sequel of the case.

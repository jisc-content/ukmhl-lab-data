179 TREATMENT OP ABSCESS IN SPINAL CARIES. "back, extension was kept up by means of a weight, and the pelvis was encased in a plaster jacket; the weight was increased up to 8 lbs. without giving any pain, but no noticeable improvement of the curvature resulted. Treatment of Yertebral Caries. The treatment of this terrible affection consists principally in keeping the patient in the recumbent position. If there was much kyphosis the back was supported by jackets made of plaster, gutta percha, or pasteboard, and the ordinary <f anti-scrofulous ” strengthening remedies were given. Sometimes, in well-nourished individuals, an issue was made in the neighbourhood of the vertebral column. In acute inflammation of the cervical vertebrae the good effects of a seton are sometimes remarkable. Treatment with ice would here also undoubtedly be of benefit if it were possible to apply the remedy more conveniently. If an ice-bladder be laid at the back of the neck the air collects at the upper part and the direct effect of the cold is lost; the patients have therefore to be kept in a half sitting-up position. In Zurich, at an earlier period of my clinical career, I was in the habit sometimes of opening abscesses connected with diseased ver- tebrae, sometimes with the trocar, or by subcutaneous incision, with caustic, etc.; no benefit was ever derived from this proceeding. I was induced at one time, though not very often, to inject iodine into these abscesses; I invariably regretted it. The chronic sup- puration becomes acute much too readily, and leads then to break- ing down of the abscess walls and most severe general symptoms. The beneficial effects of injections of tepid water, air, or water with a very slight trace of tincture of iodine, seem to me doubtful. If the opening of the abscess is too small the best plan is to dilate it with laminaria. I lost one patient from pyaemia after extending the opening by incision. Now I no longer open these abscesses, for I have come to the conclusion that matters are never improved by such treatment, and the best that can be hoped for, in the most favourable cases, is that they are not made any worse. After these abscesses have opened spontaneously they usually contract, and a sinus is left; they are then much more likely to heal. It is extremely difficult to convince oneself of the truth of these prin- ciples, much more to persuade the laity to accept them, for the

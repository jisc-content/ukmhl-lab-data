485 SARCOMA AND CARCINOMA. but I scarcely think that there is any source of error, for the occur- rence of these tumours is so characteristic that the proportion would scarcely be found to alter in a larger number of cases. Following A. von Winiwarterâ€™s plan, I have contrasted in the same way (Fig. 26) sarcoma of the cutis, cellular tissue, fascia, Fig. 26. The dotted line illustrates the cases of cancer of the breast. The plain line the cases of sarcoma of the breast. and bones, with carcinoma of the cutis and mucous membrane. In this class of cases the sarcomata commence in the first decennium at a tolerably high figure. Between the second and third they fall to some extent, rising again in the fourth to the level of the first, and then slowly falling. Carcinoma commences at a very low level in the second decennium, and rises slowly in the third and fourth, ascends rapidly to a considerable height during the fifth and sixth, does not remain long at this level, but falls almost as quickly during the next two decennia as it previously rose. The rapid fall in the carcinoma curve after the age of sixty does not, as von Winiwarter has pointed out, show that the disposition to cancerous diseases disappears at a later period of life, for it must be remembered that the number of persons living above the age of sixty is comparatively

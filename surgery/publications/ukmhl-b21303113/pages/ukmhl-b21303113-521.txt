ISOLATION OF PYLORUS. TREATMENT OF ADHESIONS. 497 small abscesses not infrequently form, leading to necrosis of portions of the gland; secondly, there is some fear that the secre- tion escaping from the pancreas may dissolve the cicatrix of the stomach by its peptonising properties. If the cancer is so united to the transverse colon that there would be risk of recurrence if the two were merely separated, we might think of resecting the transverse colon also, but this would be a fatal complication, and greatly protract the operation. If the cancer has extended over the horizontal part of the duodenum, or up to the ductus choledochus—which is very rarely the case—the operation must be discontinued. (2.) Isolation of the pylorus.•—As soon as the condition of the parts has been made out, the stomach is drawn up to the wound, and examined to see the point at which it must be cut through; we then know how far we must proceed in detaching the normal and pathological adhesions. Now follows under some circumstances the most difficult part of the operation, viz. the complete isolation of the pylorus and the portion of the stomach and duodenum immediately adjoining. To begin with, the large omentum is detached from the greater curvature, and the gastro-colic ligament cut through. The layers of the omentum are taken up in small portions between two clip forceps, which form grooves just suitable for the application of silk ligatures. The tissue is cut through in the middle between the ligatures or, still better, burnt through with the thermo-cautery. Fig. 27. 32

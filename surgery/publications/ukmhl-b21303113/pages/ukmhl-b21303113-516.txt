APPENDIX II. ACUTE PERIOSTITIS AND OSTEOMYELITIS. Professor Billroth’s views on tlie pathology of acute periostitis and osteomyelitis can best be gathered from bis ‘ Surgical Pathology,’1 2 and differ in some respects from those held by writers in this country: the morbid anatomy of the former affection is, for instance, very differently described by Billroth5 and Holmes.3 Again, it would seem that osteomyelitis, as an idio- pathic affection, is not uncommon in Germany and Austria. A comparison of the views of other writers, such as Chassaignac, Verneuil, Crampton, Gerdy, Rognetta, Sir A. Cooper, and others, show that opinions are toler- ably divided on the questions. Comil and Ranvier,4 in a very brief essay on the subject, probably hit the truth when they describe the affection as liable to commence above or beneath the periosteum or in the bone itself, from which description it is easy to see that these inflammations are at the outset hard to distinguish apart, and are apt to run one into the other. To those who are interested in these questions, I may venture to refer to a paper on the subject, an abstract of which will be found in the ‘ Lancet,’ No. 25, vol. i, 18815.

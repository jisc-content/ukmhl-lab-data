425 CHRONIC PERIOSTITIS AND OSTEOMYELITIS. There was no sequestrum ; the probe struck against a sclerosed layer of osteo- phytes ; I amputated about the middle of the thigh, hut found on sawing through the bone, that the medullary cavity contained pus; this, how- ever, only extended for a quarter of an inch above the section, and I there- fore washed it out. The flaps united by first intention, hut two sinuses were left, one on the outer and one on the inner side of the wound, which led down to the medullary cavity, from which cavity no proper granulations sprang up. Eventually, after removing subperiosteally an inch and a half of the stump of bone, the parts were induced to heal. The preparation—a most interesting one—show that the sym- ptoms had been due to an exceptionally chronic process of osteo- plastic periostitis, with chronic suppurative osteomyelitis. The osteomyelitis showed no tendency to heal, although numerous openings connected with the medullary cavity had formed externally. The medullary cavity itself, was invested by a tolerably tough pyogenic membrane. (See Fig. 31). Eio. 21.—Lowek Half of the Femue, affected with very Chronic Ostitis and Osteomyelitis.

EECENT MODIFICATIONS IN OPERATING. 319 beck's f Archives/ No. 25, by Dr. J. Mikulicz, entitled “ Zur Sprayfrage.” The temperature in the room is kept uniformly at 20° R. Great care is exercised with the sponges, and the utmost precautions are taken to ensure their proper cleanliness and asepti- city. The separate sponges are kept at least a week in a 5 per cent, solution of carbolic acid. A little time before use they are removed from this and soaked in I per cent, solution. In ovariotomies intraperitoneal treatment of the pedicle is now invariably employed. Tor the pedicle and for large adhesions the following method is in use. A special clamp is applied firmly for about one minute, so as to press out all the fluids. The clamp itself somewhat resembles a pair of long sequestrum forceps, one only of the two surfaces which come into contact being serrated. By means of a catch at the extremity of the handle the surfaces can be pressed together as tightly as required. The clamp is then removed, and a silk ligature tied round the pedicle or the adhesion, in the groove made by the clamp; but little force is found necessary in tying the strings. Bor small adhesions Pean's pince hemostatique is used In the same way as the clamp, the ligature being subsequently applied. No peritoneal drainage is now employed. In uniting the abdominal wound button sutures like those employed by Professor Lister, are found very convenient. "With regard to the antiseptic modifications recently adopted see introduction. It need only be stated here that antiseptics are rigidly carried out, save that the spray is not used. It has not been found that its discontinuance has in any way interfered with the successful results of these operations.—[Ed.]

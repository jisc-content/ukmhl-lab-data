Radical treatment of hydrocele. Remarks on chronic in- flammation of testis. “ Tubercular testis”—Treatment. Chronic orchitis leading to suppuration. Castration. Cases of malignant sarcocele. Remarks. Serpiginous syphilitic ulceration. E. W—, ret. 33, had contracted twenty-seven months previously a chancre at the orifice of the urethra. This was followed, after three weeks, by enlarged inguinal glands which rapidly ran on to suppuration. Ulcers formed about the scrotum. The ulceration and suppuration extended until almost the entire scrotum and the skin of the lower part of the abdominal wall were destroyed. Whilst infiltration appeared at one part, the ulceration healed at another ; at the margins of the cicatrices fresh infiltration constantly appeared, and broke down. Inoculation of the secretion on the arm gave rise to the same infiltration and ulceration. The greater part of the ulceration healed up after the application of caustic potash. Carcinoma of the prostate. I met with one case of this nature at Zurich in a man, ret. 30. In the course of five years the tumour had reached the size of a duck’s egg. It was very soft and could he felt in the perinreum and the rectum. I extirpated the growth, hut found that the tumour had partly extended into the bladder, and was forced to make a lateral opening the size of a shilling, in order to get it all away. The wound healed up completely, but unfortunately recurrence began in the cicatrix after two months, and the patient died about a year later. The growth proved to ho a soft, alveolar cancer, ulcerated and breaking down on tho vesical surface.

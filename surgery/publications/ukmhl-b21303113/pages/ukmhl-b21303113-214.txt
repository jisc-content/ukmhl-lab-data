The wound was closed by strapping; three days after the injury the wound was probed by a medical man, thereupon severe pleurisy occurred, which lasted three days. From the symptoms in this case, it seems possible that the wound had perforated an adhesion. F.

Both wounds were closed ; severe dyspnoea followed, treated by venesection and morphia. The dyspnoea became worse, owing to increased left pneumo- thorax. On the eighth day after the injury, the patient felt as if he were

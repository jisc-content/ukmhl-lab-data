886 EPITHELIOMA DEVELOPING IN AN ISSUE WOUND. Samuel Câ€”, set. 54, a Jewish merchant from Belgrade, had been very sub- ject to inflammation of the eyes. Twenty-eight years before I saw him, two issues had been made on the hack of the neck and on the upper arm from which considerable suppuration was kept up : six months before he came to me, the granulations of the issue wound in the arm became more sensitive and the edges harder, while the ulcer increased in size. I found an ulcer the size of a florin, in appearance highly suggestive of epithelioma, over the insertion of the deltoid muscle. Induration could he felt extending deeply down, probably to the surface of the bone. The patient was so weak and anaemic that I merely destroyed the growth with paste. He died of febrile marasmus and erysipelas some three months later. The eschar was examined microscopically, and proved to be a well-marked epithelioma, particularly rich in epidermic cells.

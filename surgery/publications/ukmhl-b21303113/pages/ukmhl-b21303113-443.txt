COCCO-BACTEBIA AND ACUTE INFLAMMATIONS. 419 both at Berlin and Vienna in children a year old; the mortality is very high when the disease occurs at more advanced periods in life. The acute infection in this disease, seems to have struck the old observers, when they named the infection, “ bone-typhus ” (Knochen- typhus).1 Bose has already pointed out its possible etiological relation to acute articular rheumatism; his proposed term “ pseudo- rheumatic” inflammation found, however, but little favour. I will not now speculate on the locality of the nidus of infection; I will only now say, that it is still premature to imagine that the infecting matter is always associated with cocco-bacteria. It is extremely difficult to decide the point, for these vegetations —although they may be truly the causes of the inflammation, and although they may be invariably found in the tissues at a time when there is no communication between the air and the seat of inflammation—perish as soon as the secretion of pus is considerable, as I have already pointed out. The cases are still few in number in which undoubted cocco-bacteria vegetations have been shown to exist in quite recent acute subcutaneous inflammation. It is by no means proved that these vegetations do not only occasionally develop in such vegetations; for we must remember that fungi— directly capable of development—which are taken into the circula- tion through the lungs, might be present at the seat of inflamma- tion and as the products of inflammation take up a great quantity of oxygen, there is, as it were, a soil particularly well adapted for the development of any kind of vegetation. If such an area of inflammation is brought, though only for a moment, into contact with the air, let the opening be spontaneous or artificial, then the fact that cocco-bacteria are found in the exudation, ceases to be a proof of any etiological relation between these vegetations and an acute inflammation. On the whole, I am inclined to the belief that most of the spon- taneously arising inflammations originate in peculiar fermentative processes in the tissues, but my observations at the bedside have not led me to conclude that the ferment must of necessity be of a vegetable or an animal character; it is established beyond doubt, that acute progressive septic inflammations can only be produced by inoculation, when the inoculated matter contains cocco-bacteria; further, that inoculation with septic matters not containing cocco- bacteria produces only symptoms of a more or less transient Using the term “ typhus” in its Hippocratic souse.

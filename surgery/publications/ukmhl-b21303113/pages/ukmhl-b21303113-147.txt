MALIGNANT TUMOURS OF NOSE. 123 the child was discharged new symptoms of recurrence took place, and the patient was readmitted in a state of dyspnoea, with the left side of the face enormously swollen and the eyeballs prominent. Resection of the upper jaw was performed, and the base of the tumour seared with the actual cautery. Eighteen months later he came back to me again, free from recurrence and in perfectly good health; inasmuch as the former recurrences had always taken place immediately after the operations, there seemed to be some hope that he might now be freed from these troubles. At' any rate, there was manifestly no tendency to continuous recurrence. Considering the fibro-sarcomatous character of these tumours, it was of course impossible to predict whether local recurrence might not take place.

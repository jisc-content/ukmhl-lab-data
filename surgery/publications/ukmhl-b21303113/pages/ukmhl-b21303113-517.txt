APPENDIX III. ON THE REMOVAL OF THE PYLORUS FOR CANCER. [The essay, of which the following is a condensed translation, is the work of Dr. Anton Wolfler. • It describes and relates four cases of removal of part of the stomach and pylorus, three of which were performed by Professor Billroth and one by Dr. Wolfler himself. From want of space, the essay has been necessarily very much abridged, nearly all the historical introduction and numerous references being omitted. The full title of the pamphlet is ‘ Ueber die von Herrn Professor Billroth Ausgefiihrten Resectionen des Carcinomatosen Pylorus,’ Vienna, 18S1.—-Ed.] In August, 1877, Billroth concluded a paper on a successful case of gasteroraphy, with a remark to the effect that it would now be but a short step to an operation for removal of cancer of the stomach. Again, two years later, in speaking of a case of entero- raphy, he pointed out that there was no insuperable obstacle to partial resection of the stomach either on anatomical, physiological, or operative grounds; “ it must succeed.” Gussenbauer and v. Winiwarter were the first to show by ex- periments on animals that the physiological objections were not insuperable. In the case of a dog experimented on by Czerny and Kaiser,1 the animal not only lived a long time after removal of the entire stomach, but the weight of the body increased one half in the course of eight months. It is an interesting fact that gastero- raphy was performed by a Bavarian surgeon, in 1521.3 The first surgeon actually to perform resection of the pylorus was Peaii, who operated on April 5th, 1879. The patient died in five days.3 1 Kaiser: ‘ Beitrago zu den Operationen am Magen.’ Czerny’s ‘ Beitragen zur Operativen Chirurgie.’ Stuttgart, 1878.

A eew cases of deep suppuration in the cellular tissue, occurring without known cause, came under treatment. The symptoms were very severe, and a long time elapsed before the abscess presented externally. In all the cases, as early as possible, careful dissecting incisions were carried down to the abscess. One man, thirty-three years old, died of septic fever with mediastinitis and pleuritis. A man, fifty-two years of age, died from sudden profuse haemorrhage' causing suffocation. The left superior thyroid artery, which lay on the wall of the abscess, was found to be ulcerated through. An opening also had formed in the left wall of the pharynx. The cause and origin of these phlegmonous inflammations, most of which go on to suppuration, is by no means always clear. In one of iny cases it was due to perichondritis of the larynx; in another I think acute parostitis about the angle of the lower jaw set

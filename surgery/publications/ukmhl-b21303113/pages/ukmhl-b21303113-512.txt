Professor Billroth himself speaks very disparag- ingly of the former operation (‘ Surg. Path, and Therapeut.,’ Hackley’s trans- lation, p. 488).

Holmes, delivered before the British Medical Association at Cambridge in 1880, and published in the ‘ Brit. Med. Journ.’ for August of that year.—[Ed.] 33 33 33 33 33 33

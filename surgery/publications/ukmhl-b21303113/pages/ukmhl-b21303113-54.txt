30 ERYSIPELAS AND SEPTO-PY2EMIA. this chart, I think that the fall observed between 1863-66 may be ascribed to the open treatment of wounds. The remarkable rise in 1869 was principally due to an improper sanitary condition of the female wards. If the erysipelas chart he compared with that showing the number of cases of septo-pyaemia (Fig. 2) it will be observed that there is no great amount of correspondence between the two. In 1863, it will be noticed that the line begins to fall; now, this period again corresponds to the date when I first employed the open treatment of wounds. I did not adopt the antiseptic method till 1875. On the whole, the tables suggest that the mere treat- ment of wounds has not such an all-powerful influence as we are disposed to ascribe to it, but that other agencies are concernedâ€” agencies which we do not know, though we can guess what their nature is.

When the greater part of the foot is frost-bitten, my rule is to wait for a complete line of demarcation to form, before resorting to amputation. Judging from more recent experience, I think I should now, in such cases, operate at an earlier date. It rarely happens that parts, which, after thawing, are blue in colour and covered with blebs, again come to life, even when arterial blood follows a deep puncture with a needle. Owing to the decomposition of the tissues, there is always risk of phlegmonous inflammation starting in the deeper parts and leading to general septic infection, for the process of absorption, still—though feebly—goes on. The danger arising from this cause certainly overbalances the advan- tage gained by waiting for the line of demarcation to form in the skin; we might possibly, by waiting, be able to amputate an inch or two lower down, but the patients not infrequently die before

CAN(MR OF OMENTUM AND PELVIC VISCERA. 238 was correctly diagnosed to be situated in the omentum; in the other, no precise diagnosis could be formed. In both there was marked ascites. Both cases were operated on, the operation in each instance lasting about two hours. One of the patients died of anaemia in eighteen hours, the other was carried off by peritonitis in six days. The entire peritoneum, the superficial surface of the intestines, ovaries and uterus, were studded with small nodules, whose existence was of course only revealed on the removal of the large omental tumour, which was universally adherent. The peri- toneum becomes involved so rapidly in such cases, that there is no hope of removing all the diseased parts completely, by operation; even if this were possible, there would be no prospect of any lasting benefit.

338 CANCER DEVELOPING IN A CONGENITAL TUMOUR. since. Some years later, two fresh openings formed, from which at times sovere haemorrhage took place. I found a tumour the size of a manâ€™s head dependent from the sacral region, ulcerated in parts. The growth was removed, and proved to be a cysto-sarcoma, in the centre of which was a curiously formed mass of cartilage. At the lower end of the sacrum, the growth was not very sharply defined; a few cysts extended down into the depth of the bone which were not followed up. The cysts were found to be lined with ciliated epithelium. The epithelium of the ulcerating cysts was arranged in thick multiple layers, in which two distinct forms of cells were found, closely resembling those seen in epithelial cancer. No projections or gland-like ingrowths of the epithelial masses could be traced into the interstitial connective tissue. The wound did not completely heal, and the remnants of the cyst epithelium projected fungus-like, extend- ing also into the surrounding tissue. The surface of the wound resembled in appearance that of a carcinomatous ulcer; the right inguinal glands became enlarged and broke, and fungating masses which microscopically were identical with epithelial carcinoma, projected from the openings. This case is of the highest interest as showing that a con- genital cystic tumour may, at a late period of life, acquire cancerous characteristics and become infective. We heard subsequently that the patient died a few months after leaving the hospital. The post mortem revealed nothing that had not been already discovered.

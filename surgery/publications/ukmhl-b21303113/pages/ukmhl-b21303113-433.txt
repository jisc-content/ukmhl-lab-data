VARIETIES OF GANGRENE. 400 to call it, “ gangrene from internal causes/5 may arise, as we now know, in many different ways. Owing to the researches of Dupuytren, Raynaud, Virchow and others, it is possible to do more than merely distinguish between dry and moist gangrene,, and we are now enabled, at the bedside, to make a diagnosis that is accurate anatomically as well as etiologically. The varieties may be classified as follows : (a) Gangrene from Anaemia. (Asphvxie Locale.1) In severe and extensive cases of this nature no good results can be expected from amputation, and if the process be not limited to small parts of the skin, and the gangrenous parts do not come away of themselves, the disease is necessarily fatal. There is probably some affinity between this disease and the affection recently described as anaemia perniciosa. (b) Gangrene due to Embolism. In all the cases I met with, the embolism was situated at the bifurcation of the popliteal artery, and arose from endo-myocarditis and valvular disease or some other severe and acute general affection. This form is characterised by (i) its sudden onset; (2) by pain, usually severe and frequently noticed from the second to about the sixth day; the limb at first becomes white, and devoid of sensation but with formication, then livid and painful; (3) by the gangrene occurring simultaneously over the whole foot and leg, the foot as a rule, being mummified, while at the limit of the circu- lation the gangrene is more moist in character; (4) by the shape of the line of demarcation, which appears anteriorly as a transverse line close under the tuberosities of the tibia, and at the back marks out a flap three or four inches long over the calf. in such cases, amputation of the thigh is the best treatment, and should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is established. 1 ‘ De 1 Asphyxie Locale et do la Gangrene Symetrique des Extrdmitds,’ Raynaud, 1862.

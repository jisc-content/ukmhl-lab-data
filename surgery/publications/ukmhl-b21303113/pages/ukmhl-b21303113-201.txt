Case of necrosis of lumbar vertebrae. Remarks on treatment of ver- tebral caries. Treatment of abscess. Cases of mistaken dia- gnosis in retro-pharyngeal abscess. Remarks on tumours of ver- tebral column. Lateral curvature—treatment of. Cases of spina bifida. Dislocation of the third cervical vertebra forwards without fracture. This injury was the result of a fall from the second storey of a house. The patient had also a depressed fracture of the skull, and a fractured sternum. When admitted into the hospital, he was not completely comatose, hut in such a condition that it was not possible to estimate the degree of anaesthesia; he lay motionless, but could at will move the fingers on both sides. Death resulted on the second day, from oedema of the lungs. Among my cases of caries of the vertebral column is a remarkable instance of a girl, set. 8, in whom an abscess developed at the back of the neck, in consequence of which the head was always craned obliquely forward. An extraordinary amount of mobility was evi- dent between the third and fourth cervical vertebrse. If the head were not fixed it fell forwards, as a sub-luxation had made its appearance between the vertebrse named; the condition was not painful, and by raising the head reduction was easily effected. I have never yet met with, or read of, any other similar case; yet I can only explain the condition on the supposition that it was the result of disease of the vertebral column, possibly a case of rapid destruc- tion of the intervertebral discs, with relaxation of the vertebral ligaments. As long as the head was fixed by a fillet, like the instru- ment for torticollis, her condition was tolerable. No alteration 12 ■ LIBRARY >)

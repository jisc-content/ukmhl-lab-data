388 CONTUSIONS. FRACTURE OP NECK OF FEMUR. the stage of demarcation is reached. My opinion therefore is, that we should amputate through healthy parts as soon as the gangrene has declared itself up to the middle of the foot or to the leg. In the case of frost-bitten toes alone, we may wait for spon- taneous separation. Contusions of the Hip. Contusions about the trochanter were common enough; the patients came under treatment at very varying periods after the injury. When no distinct fracture or luxation is evident, the diagnosis may be very difficult; fissure of the acetabulum, extravasation of blood into the joint, with circumscribed periostitis about the trochanter, may be suspected where the function of the part is impaired for any great length of time.

In no case which has come under my observation have I seen chronic coxitis develop, but the patients were usually strong, healthy men. Fracture oe the Neck of the Femur. Of nineteen cases which came under me at Zurich, eight were extracapsular and eleven intracapsular fractures. M'hen possible I always apply a plaster-of-Paris bandage in these cases, but it is undesirable to adopt this mode of treatment when the patients are very much reduced, and likely to get bed-sores. For such I found the best plan was to keep them quietly in bed, with the hip and knee flexed, the legs being bent over a pillow at the knees. One man, set. 73, died of pyaemia forty-three days after the injury. jFracture of the femur, followed by gangrene. Conrad Gâ€”, ffit. 23, was struck by a heavy rolling-stone on the right thigh. He was unable to stand upright after the injury, and was brought a few hours later to the hospital with a fracture of the femur four or five inches above the knee, and much contusion of the soft parts.

CHAPTER II. CARBOLIC ACID POISONING. Many men are in the habit of denying rare, but unpleasant occurrences until they themselves have experienced them; the peculiarity is not uncommon. There are many surgeons sceptical on the subject of death from chloroform; may it be their good fortune never to be undeceived. So, again, the number of those who disbelieve in death from carbolic-acid poisoning is by no means small, and yet death from carbolic acid is far more frequent than from chloroform. During the time that I employed solutions of chloride of lime and acetate of alum as antiseptic agents, I had reason to be grati- fied with the success to which I could fairly lay claim. Cases, however, occurred at times when I was less satisfied with the efficacy of these materials, especially when used in concentrated solutions. I found then that superficial eschars were formed, and the discharge of the secretion from the deeper parts was hin- dered. Eor a long time past I have devoted my attention to the subject, and, at my request. Dr. Gersuny1 and Dr. Steiner2 tried some experiments with solutions of carbolic acid and chloride of zinc. The results of their investigations were, briefly, as follows : —“Both agents were found, unfortunately, to be thoroughly efficacious antiseptics only when employed in highly concentrated solutions. When so used the cellular tissue and the coats of the vessels were corroded; such effects in large hollow wounds, espe- cially in the axilla, might entail very serious consequences. Weaker solutions were found powerless to check decomposition of the secretions in recent hollow wounds, still less where the suppura- tion had already lost its healthy character.5’ These investigations were published at the end of 1871 and the commencement of 1872. 1 ‘Arch, fiir Kl.

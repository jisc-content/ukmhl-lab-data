POLYPUS NASI. NASO-PHARYNGEAL POLYPUS. 99 not be done, perhaps, always on the first occasion, but should in- variably be practised after the first recurrence. In two cases in which repeated recurrence took place, the bone tissue of the maxillae became gradually atrophied. An extensive resection of the superior maxilla was found necessary, after which no fresh recurrence took place. In one other case, at the third removal of the tumour by means of bone forceps, the inferior maxilla was fractured. Osseous union followed. Osieo-chondro-fibroma of the loner jaw. The tumour shown in the illustration (Pig. 7) was met with in a woman, thirty-five years of age, in whom it had existed for thirty-five years. She was operated upon by Dr. Menzel, but died of erysipelas. A full record of the case will be found in the ‘ Archiv. f. kL Chirurg.,’ I Heft, Bd. xiii. Polypus nasi. In large polypi my practice is invariably to break off the lower turbinated bone, as by this means recurrence is best obviated. Naturally, reaction is greater than after simple extraction of the polypus. In one case erysipelas followed the operation. The other patients recovered rapidly and completely. After two or three com- plete removals recurrence does not usually take place. Naso-pharyngeal Polypus. It is remarkable to observe how frecjuently polypus-nasi occurs in men, especially those between ten and thirty years of age. In this respect, these new formations resemble sarcoma of the jaw. In eight cases osteoplastic resection of the jaw was performed, and the tumour was then removed with the ecraseur or thegalvano- caustic loop. The stumps of these polypi can often be felt some weeks after operation, but new polypi do not always develop and many of them atrophy. In small polypi rhinoscopic examination is of importance.

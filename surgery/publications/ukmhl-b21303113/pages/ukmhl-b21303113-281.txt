A fortnight previously he was in perfectly good health ; he was then attacked with obstinate constipation, frequent desire to pass water, and pain in micturition. He was treated before he came to us, by laxatives, and catheterisation. When admitted, the catheter passed easily, but deviated to the left as it entered the bladder. Deep down in the pelvis could be felt a soft, elastic tumour, the size of a foetal head, which was also perceptiblo from the rectum. I supposed that it was a retroperitoneal malignant growth of the pelvis. I ordered the water, which was turbid, alkaline,'and contained pus, to he drawn off regularly, and the bladder to he washed out. The man died a week after admission. Post mortem : A retro-peritoneal abscess was found, which had perforated the bladder in two places. Abscesses in this situation are very rare in men, though they are not of infrequent occurrence in the female sex. If a correct diagnosis had been made, puncture by the rectum might have saved the patient's life. 17

300 STATISTICS 01*' OVAIUOTOHT. course very hard to decide in such cases whether the tumour be due to the refilling of the former cyst, or whether it is a fresh growth. It might be asserted that my diagnosis in the case above quoted was possibly incorrect, and that the cyst had not originated in the ovary but in the broad ligament. I freely admit the possi- bility ; my power of differential diagnosis does not reach so far. Injection of iodine into ovarian cysts will always be a com- paratively rare operation, for the treatment is only properly appli- cable to unilocular cysts, with serous contents. Such cysts— according to my experience—are very rarely met with. Excepting the case described above, I have only met with one other, where the method might have been adopted. Ovariotomy. (W. B. 1876). Between 1865 and 1880, I performed one hundred and forty ovariotomies, with the results shown in the following table:— Cases. Kccovered. Died.

I am far from doubting the occurrence of such cases, though in the first two classes mentioned we may reasonably doubt whether the

CHAPTER V. HEAD INJURIES. Section A.—Scalp wounds without brain symptoms—Case. Injury to skull without Irain symptoms—Cases. Fatal case of punc- tured wound. Case of concussion with pulpy discharge from the ear. Cases of severe concussion. Cases—Depressed frac- ture of the skull, fractured base, encephalitis. Two cases of head injury with late cerebral symptoms. Case of trephining. Case of cerebral abscess without fractured skull. General remarks on head injuries. The following cases are separated according to tire custom which usually obtains in surgical text-books, into injuries of—(i) the soft parts; (2) the bones ; (3) scalp; and (4) brain. Eor practical purposes this seems the "best arrangement. Cases of scalp wound without any brain symptoms.—An injury of this nature occurred in a man who came into the hospital with sym- ptoms of septic poisoning. Post mortem.—Neither meningitis, thrombosis of the sinuses, nor metastatic abscesses were found. The other two were children of five and eleven years old respec- tively, in whom the scalp was extensively torn. In both, suppura- tive meningitis with thrombosis of the sinuses was discovered after death ; the younger child died on the twenty-eighth, the elder on the twenty-fifth, day after the injury. In the latter case a few days before death the right cornea sloughed, owing to compression of the oph- thalmic division of the fifth nerve by pus in the cavernous sinuses.1 My constant practice is to sew up scalp wounds when they gape widely, but I remove the sutures if any considerable swelling and pain appears in the neighbourhood of the wound. If this be not promptly done, I generally found much pain, tension, and sharp fever result. 1 This case is fully reported in the ‘Wien. Woollens.,’ 1S67.

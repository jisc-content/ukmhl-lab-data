479 FREQUENCY OF TUMOURS IN THE SEXES. bably accounted for by the ovariotomies. The difference is all the more striking in that the number of women admitted into the hospital was far smaller than that of the men, for I have three male and only two female wards. The number of tumours, therefore, occur- ring in women might be thought much larger, but a correction has to be made; men are so much more subject to injuries than women that the numbers will deceive at first sight; subtracting the cases of injury, I find that the distribution of surgical diseases is about equal in the two sexes. Still, after making this correction, I find that females are actually more liable to tumours. In men tumours of the face, principally cancers, constitute the only class which occurs with preponderating frequency; this is compensated for by the larger number of cancers of the breast in women. The larger number of cases occurring in the female sex is accounted for by the fact that the organs of generation are far more affected with tumours (cancers of the external organs of the uterus, fibroma of the uterus, ovarian tumours) than is the case with the male sex (cancers of the penis, testicle, fibroma of the prostate). The marked preponderance of lipoma in the female sex is striking, and is probable accounted for by the greater development of the panniculus adiposus. Again, in angioma, the female sex (63) is far more often affected than the male sex (38), the difference being so material that all chance of accident may be excluded. This is all the more interesting, as in most of these cases we have to deal with congenital anomalies.

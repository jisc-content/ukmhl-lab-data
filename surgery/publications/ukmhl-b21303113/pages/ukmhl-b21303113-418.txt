Probably at the time that I frac- tured the limb I splintered the bone, and the slow absorption led to some ostitis, which thus hindered the patient for a long time from using the limb. Faulty union after fracture of the leg. A man, set. 40, fourteen months previous to his admission to the hospital had sustained a fracture of the external malleolus, and sub-luxation of the astragalus. Considerable deformity resulted from the injury. An inch and a half above the malleolus there was a sharp bend in the leg, and the heel was displaced outwards so that the position of the foot was like that seen in a high degree of valgus. Good union had taken place, but he was not able to walk well. With great difficulty I managed to improve the position of the foot, by breaking through the new formed bone, and eventually was so far successful that the patient was able to walk fairly well with the help of a specially constructed boot. It was found impossible, however, to correct the deformity of the foot completely.

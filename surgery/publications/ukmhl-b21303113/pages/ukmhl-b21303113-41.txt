CHAPTER III. 2 HOSPITAL GANGRENE (DIPHTHERITIC INFLAMMATION OF WOUNDS) AND PYAEMIA. I met with no cases of this nature while at Zurich. Ten came under my care while I was at Vienna, between 1867 and 1876, but five of these did not originate in the hospital; all recovered. Hospital gangrene differs so essentially from erysipelas and phlegmonous inflammation, and is so widely dissimilar in its course, that we are justified in the supposition that it has a separate and and special cause of origin. With regard to its etiology, probably the majority of surgeons hold the same opinion as they do of erysipelas and diphtheritis, that is to say, they suppose it may either originate spontaneously, or by contagion. I have not seen much of the disease, but my observa- tions have led me decidedly to the conclusion that, in hospitals, the disease almost invariably spreads by contagion; and, secondly, that the contagious material—whatever it be—is of short life, tolerably definite action, and is easily destroyed. With regard to the first point, there is, according to my experi- ence, among the ordinary forms of septic conditions of wounds and ulcers, none which can set up the rapidly progressing phagedaenic disease known as hospital gangrene. As yet it has not been found possible to produce hospital gangrene experimentally. I still liesi- 'tate to accept unconditionally the assurance of our best observers, that zymotic germs have much to do with the causation of erysipe- las, diphtheritis, septicaemia, and pyaemia; but in hospital gan- grene there appears to be no doubt that the disease is so caused. Aot only is this shown by microscopical examination of the pulpy tissue and the edges of the ulceration, but also by the manner in which the process begins and spreads in the wound. The manner in which the tissue is destroyed is so peculiar that I cannot but believe that this disease is due to some special kind of

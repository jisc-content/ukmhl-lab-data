CHAPTER XIX. STATISTICS OF TUMOURS.1 I have before now had occasion to remark, when reviewing the statistics of tumours in my Zurich records, that a summary taken entirely from the in-patient department can give no accurate idea of what a complete statistical return of tumours would show. In such a summary many cases of carcinoma of the stomach, the intestinal canal, and the liver, sarcoma of the brain and lungs (which it must be admitted are of rarer occurrence), carcinoma of the kidney, etc., would not be included, for such were treated in the department for internal diseases. Since surgical gvnmcology has become a separate branch, most of the cases of cancer of the rectum, vulva and uterus, have been separated, and, in many university clinics, ovarian tumours also. Of fibroma of the uterus, only the rare cases have been included which came under operation. Many minor operations, such as removal of nasal mucous polypi, sebaceous cysts, hypertrophied tonsils, and angiomata, were treated in the out-patient department. In the following tables primary tumours only are taken into account. Tumours set up by infection and metastatic growths are, of course, entirely excluded. Comparing the proportionate frequency of tumours and of spon- taneously arising acute or chronic inflammatory processes, I find that, taking the figures from i860 to 1876, 2058 are classified under the former head (tumours), and 3061 under the latter (iu- flammations). The Zurich tables show that the number of acute and chronic inflammations far exceeded that of the tumours (1203 : 526) in Vienna the numbers were 1858 : 1533. It would, however, be rash to conclude that the population of Vienna is more 1 See also on this subject, A. v. Winiwarter’s work, ‘ Beitrage zur Statistik der Carcinome ’ (Stuttgart, 1878, F. Ecke), the materials for which were drawn from the clinic at Vienna.

In other respects the child physically as well as mentally was nor- mally developed for its age. Papillary polypoid vegetations of the vagina and urinary bladder in a child eighteen months of age. The case was one of a very peculiar nature. According to the parents the child’s health had been perfectly good up to two months previously. It then had pain during micturition, and mucus, pus and blood were often seen about the genitals. When admitted the vagina was found to be full of vegetations.

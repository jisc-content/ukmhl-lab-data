CASE OE MULTIPLE FIBRO-FATTY TUMOURS. 93 Multiple soft fibro fatty tumours. (Leontiasis, molluscum lipomatosum, elephantiasis arabum').1 Case.—The patient was 33 years of age, and had suffered from the above affection for thirty-one years. The condition will be best understood by the illustration (Fig. 4); the right eye was found to be destroyed—probably from panophthalmitis. A few similar- tumours, varyiug in size from a pea to a bean, were found on the back and chest. The vision of the left eye was normal, but the patient was unable to see unless he raised up the folds of the eyelid with his fingers, or arranged his hat so to keep the pendulous masses out of the way. I operated on him on twenty different occasions. The ultimate result is shown in Fig. 3. When he left there was a slight ectropium, and he had not recovered any power in his left eyelid. I did not, however, dare to diminish the size of the lid any more, for fear of endangering the cornea. A strip of plaster was applied, so as to keep the fold raised and enable him to see.

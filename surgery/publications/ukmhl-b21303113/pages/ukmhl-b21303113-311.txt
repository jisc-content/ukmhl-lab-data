EXTROVERSION OF THE BLADDER AND EPISPADIAS. 287 sibly the union of the symphysis might bring about also the closure of the sphincter vesicse. I do not think that this expectation will be fulfilled as long as the penis is not detached from the ends of the sym- physis and allowed to sink back. The completion of the operation when children are about four years old, will always have the advan- tage that as the prolapsed bladder is covered up, the little patients avoid a part of the distressing effects of this malformation; but it requires an intelligent person to apply and constantly wear with due care the required apparatus. Such intelligence can hardly be looked for before the patients are ten or twelve years of age. Further experience is necessary in order to prove whether the pyelitis with which extroversion of the bladder is in so many cases asso- ciated, can be improved or cured by the operation. I do not myself feel very hopeful on this point. I hope there are many of my col- leagues like myself, who take a special interest in gradually over- coming difficulties which at first seem invincible. The records of what I have been able to achieve are to me as so many sign-posts pointing out what still remains to be striven for and attained. 1 learn, through the kindness of Dr. J. Mikulicz, that Prof. Billroth’s experience of these operations since writing the above has not been of a very encouraging nature. Some of the patients operated on died of cysto-pyelitis, and this complication seems on the whole to have justified the rather gloomy forebodings expressed in the above pages. For the past two years Prof. Billroth has not operated on any of these cases.— [Ed.]

CHRONIC DISEASE OF WRIST. 373 Chronic Inflammation of the Wrist-joint. A table of twenty cases—in five of which excision was per- formed—will be found in the fBericht' for 1860-67, p. 440. All my excisions of the wrist were performed by means of two lateral incisions; none of the patients died from the operation. Out of the five cases, two only recovered completely with a tolerably useful hand; in one other the sinuses were still open, though the patient's general condition was good, four years after operation. One died four years after the operation of phthisis, and a girl, who had at the same time caries of the foot, died of marasmus two or three months after the operation. In two instances the disease of the wrist was limited to a few of the carpal bones. One of these patients recovered with ankylosis after the removal of two of the bones, and the other after the extraction of one. Excision of the wrist. Vincenz N—, £et. 20, was admitted with necrosis of the outer half of the second metacarpal bone, whioh had existed for about a year. This bone was removed, but swelling about the wrist, and eventually suppuration of the carpal joints followed. The entire carpus was then excised, and the patient left some months later with very slight swelling of the part; three sinuses still remained open, but no diseased bone could be felt. Notwithstanding repeated inquiry, we were unable to learn any- thing farther of this patient; this is matter for greater regret, as so few minute records are obtainable of the ultimate results of excision of the wrist.

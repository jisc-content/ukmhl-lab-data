HYDROCELE OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS 955 the ovary projects into the peritoneum. (Fig. 569.) If tliis is so, excision of the tunica vaginalis lining the scrotum means complete excision of the tunica, and recurrence is most unlikely. The operation is a simple one, and is easily performed through a two-inch incision in the scrotum. Care should be taken to arrest all haemorrhage, even from the smallest bleeding-points, otherwise a troublesome hsematoma may result.

The former, as less liable to be followed by complications, is probably the better course to pursue. Treatment of suppuration.—As in cases of suppuration else- where, the abscess cavity should be opened and drained. 2.

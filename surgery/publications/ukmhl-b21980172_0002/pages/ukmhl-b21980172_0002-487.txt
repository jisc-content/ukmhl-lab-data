MECKEL'S DIVERTICULUM 443 On the other hand, it may become pear-shaped, or even spherical, and undergo considerable hypertrophic thickening, and, if it becomes occluded at each end, it forms a cystic tumour filled with mucus (Fig. 400). The structure of the pervious portion of the diverticulum is similar to that of the lower ileum. A series of cases has recently been recorded in which masses of pancreatic tissue were found embed- ded in the wall of the diverticulum, a condition which is probably to be ex- plained by the fact that until the third week of development the mouth of the yolk sac extends up to the second part of the duodenum, where the pancreas has its origin. The vascular cord of the diverticulum may be represented by an impervious fibrous band — the terminal ligament— which is attached to the anterior abdo- minal wall at, or some distance below, the umbilicus (Fig. 397). The end of a free diverticulum or the terminal ligament may form new attach- ments to the mesentery of the ileum, to an adjacent coil of bowel, or to some other viscus, and form an arcade or ring through which a loop of bowel may pass and become strangulated (Fig. 401). Complications.—L Inflammation of a Meckel's diverticulum —diverticulitis—is attended with symptoms closely resembling those of appendicitis, a condition for which it is usually mistaken before the abdomen is opened. 2. In a considerable proportion of cases, the ileum is narrowed at, or more frequently just above, the level at wHch the diverticulum Fig. 399.—Tubular form of Meckel's diverticulum. {Ajiatoinical Museum^ Unh't'isity of Ediuln(rgh.)

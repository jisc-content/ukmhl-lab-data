FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE 138 to ten days must elapse before suckling can be allowed with safety. The stitches may be removed by degrees, commencing on the third day, or all may be left until the seventh or eighth day. Either method gives satisfactory results, provided common sense is employed in carrying it out. When removing stitches it is always advisable to stupefy the child with chloroform, lest a sudden movement or a violent fit of crying make the wound gape. Operations for Single Hare-Lip Nelaton's operation.—As a primary operation this method is only applicable to defects of very limited extent, and for this reason can seldom be employed. It is more often of value in correcting an Fig. 307.—Nelaton's operation. indentation of the lip, the result of cicatricial contraction after some other form of operation (Fig. 307). An inverted V-shaped incision is made through the whole thickness of the lip above and around the margin of the cleft. The skin and mucous membrane is then pulled downwards until the wound becomes diamond-shaped, when its edges are approximated with a few hori- zontally placed sutures. Rose's operation.—As this method only yields good results when the two sides of the cleft are more or less symmetrical, its application is somewhat limited. It is described here because it illustrates two of the points that were emphasized in discussing the operative procedure in general, viz. (1) that the height of the lip may be increased by curving the vertical incisions outwards, and (2) that the incisions forming the flaps must be placed exactly between the skin and the red border of the lip. Two curved incisions with their concavities directed towards each other are carried from the apex of the cleft to the junction of the

658 THE RFXTUM AND ANAL CANAL By H. S. CLOGG, M.S.Lond., F.R.G.S.Eng. Anatomy—The rectum commences in front of the 3rd (sometimes the 2nd) sacral vertebra, and ends by passing through the pelvic diaphragm, about 1| in. below and in front of the tip of the coccyx, opposite the lower part of the prostate in the male, and the lower fourth of the vagina in the female. It lies entirely within the pelvic cavity, and measures about 6 in. in the adult. Its relations are seen Fig. 476.—Male pelvis in vertical median section, showing the rectum and anal canal in section, their anterior and posterior relations, and the recto-vesical reflexion of the peritoneum.

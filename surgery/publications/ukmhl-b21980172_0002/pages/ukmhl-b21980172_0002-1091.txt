CORPOREAL INFLAMMATION 1013 CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS This is very apt to follow acute infection, because the drainage from the uterine cavity is poor, while the numerous glands readily harbour organisms. In many cases of so-called " endometritis," how- ever, endocervicitis is alone present, the internal os forming a natural barrier to infection. Pathology.—Two stages may be distinguished—(1) the hyper- trophic, (2) the atrophic. 1. In the earlier stage the endometrium is swollen and the inter- glandular stroma •crowded with in- flammatory cells. At first these are largely polymor- phonuclear leuco- cytes, but later many lymphocytes, with plasma cells and other forms, appear. The glands are elongated and distended, and their lining epithe- lium is irregular at first and later hy- pertrophic. (Fig- 585.) The mucosa is hypersemic, as is the whole uterus. The endometrial surface may be ir- regular or even polypoid {'polypoid endometritis). 2. Later the stroma becomes shrunken, fibrous, and much less cellular. The glands atrophy and disappear, or here and there are maintained as retention cysts. (Fig. 586.) The fibrosis extends more or less deeply throughout the whole thickness of the uterine wall, producing the condition known as fibrotic metritis {see p. 1016). Clinical features. — The physical signs of the associated chronic endocervicitis are present as well ; in addition, the body of the uterus is enlarged, and in the earlier stages is tender and soft, whilst later on it becomes hard and painless. The menstrual loss is excessive, especially in cases of fibrotic metritis. Fig. 585.—Chronic endometritis, hypertrophic stage. The glands are very large and irregular. The double or treble epithelial contours are due to cross-sections of infoldings of the gland walls. The stroma is full of inflammatory cells.

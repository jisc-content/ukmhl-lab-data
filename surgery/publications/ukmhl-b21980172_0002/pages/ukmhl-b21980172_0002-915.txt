843 URETERIC CALCULUS In shape they resemble a date or a coffee-bean. When large they may be round or sa,usage-shaped. Ureteral calculi weighing 816 gr. (Bloch), 803 gr. (Carless), and 780 gr. (Pederoff) have been recorded. The surface may be smooth, bossy, or spiculated. (Fig. 546.) There is frequently a stricture below the point of impaction. In old-standing cases the ureter above the calculus is dilated, and the kidney hydronephrotic. There are calculi in the corresponding kidney Fig. 546.—Collection of ureteric calculi.

Pyonephrosis may be found ; sclerosis and atrophy of the kidney are rare. Symptoms.—When the calculus passes along the ureter there is an attack of renal colic, repeated at frequent or at long intervals. The pain may commence at a spot in the line of the ureter lower than the kidney, and it may remain fixed at this spot. There may also be fixed, dull aching pain over some part of the ureter. This pain is aggravated by movement or straining, or on taking diuretics. The attacks of colic may be frequent and severe till the calculus is expelled into the bladder. The patient frequently feels something drop into the bladder, and the pain ceases. After some hours or days the cal- culus is discharged from the urethra.

But Ribbert has also described a special mixed tumour of the submaxillary gland wliich he calls a cylindroma. He says that in this both epithelial Fig. 344.—Mixed tumour of the submaxillary gland. and connective-tissue elements are derived from tlie original structure of the gland itself. The diagnosis of these tumours is not easy. Rehance cannot be placed on any one sign alone ; it is, however, safe to assume that any hard, irregular, movable tumour in the region of one of the sahvary glands which has persisted for some time is probably a mixed tumour. The diagnosis can only be clinched with the aid of the microscope. Treatment. — This consists in removing the tumour at the earliest possible opportunity.

2 21 WHITEHEAD'S OPERATION around tlie affected half, from the frsenum anteriorly, to the anterior pillar of the fauces posteriorly. If necessary, this latter structure is divided. As much mucous membrane as possible should be left, as it falls into position and covers the raw surfaces, but the first essen- tial is to cut wide of the growth. If the disease is situated near the anterior part of the tongue, it is advisable to draw one or two incisors, so that the scissors can be dipped down behind the jaw close to the bone. The affected half is now free internally and laterally, so that by Fig. 339.â€”Whitehead's operation (intrabuccal) for removal of half the tongue. (After Foivler.) traction on the suture it can be dragged well out of the mouth. By a series of short scissor-cuts, beginning in front, the deep attachments to the hyoid bone are severed ; this dissection should be very thorough, every effort being made to remove the muscular fibres right down to the hyoid. The half of the tongue will now be attached posteriorly only, and contains the lingual arteries still intact. If these have not been secured previously, they may be exposed before division, as follows : A number of short snips are made through the posterior attachments of the organ, with separation of the muscular fibres ; near the middle line the artery will start into view as a bluish cord.

Lymphatic spread. ■—The lymphatic vessels of the rectum accompany the hsemorrhoidal veins, and pass backwards and upwards to the pararectal glands, which lie in close connexion with the lateral and posterior surfaces of the bowel from just above the attachment of the levator ani muscle to the upper limits of the rec- tum. Their efferent ves- sels accompany the veins in the pelvic mesocolon, and enter glands adjacent to the superior hsemorrhoidal vessels, lowermost of these glands are situated immediately in front sacral hollow, but higher up as the mesentery in- creases in length they become farther removed from the sacrum, whilst at the upper limit they are not far distant from the pelvic brim, and in some cases may communi- cate with the glands along the iliac vessels. Efferent vessels from these enter glands situated around the inferior mesenteric vessels, which are prac- tically continuous with the lumbar glands. Experi- mental injection of the lymphatics of the rectum shows that in some cases Fig. 513.—Cancer of rectum. The of the

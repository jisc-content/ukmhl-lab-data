CARCINOMA OF GALL-BLADDER 761 whole wall of the gall-bladder, which is white, glistening, and tightly contracted on a mass of calculi (Fig. 532) ; (3) rarely as a fungating growth, filling the gall-bladder and perhaps causing haemor- rhage (Fig. 534). Microscopically, the growth is usually columnar or spheroidal- celled. It tends to spread down the ducts and to involve the liver by direct extension ; later it may extend to the colon, duodenum, or peritoneum. Clinical features The early history is usually that of cholelithiasis, gradually followed by long-continued illness, with constant hepatic pain and pro- gressive emaciation, dispropor- tionate to gall-stone disease. Jaundice appears late in about half the cases. Physical signs may be entirely absent, or there may be a hard, nodular tumour in • the gall-bladder region. Diagnosis. — Gall-stones, especially with inflammatory complications, malignant disease of the liver, carcinoma of the stomach adherent to the liver, or a growth in the hepatic flexure, most commonly lead to confusion. The history and symptoms rather than the physical signs are likely to aid in differen- tiation. Prognosis. — Death usually occurs within six months. Operative treat- ment.— Unless the pre- sence of unequivocal secondary deposits renders operation useless, exploration should always be made, for inflammatory masses may Fig. 534.—Carcinoma of of the fungating type. the gall-bladder The viscus was greatly distended (Actual size.) with haemorrhage.

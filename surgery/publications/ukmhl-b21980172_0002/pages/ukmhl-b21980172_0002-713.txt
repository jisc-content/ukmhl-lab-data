PROGNOSIS IN STRANGULATED HERNIA 657 and forcible ; when the voniit is actually fsecal the time of grace has passed, and, as Handley has pointed out, this sign must be looked upon as a prcesagium mortis. The older the patient, the worse the prognosis, since in these cases exhaustion sets in rapidly, and the inability to expectorate the foul sputum and mucus from the larynx is very distressing. When, in a strangulated hernia of some standing, and in wliich vomiting has been active the vomiting suddenly ceases, the patient going into collapse or, as sometimes happens, saying he feels better, a grave suspicion should be entertained of rupture or perforation of the bowel. Elderly subjects are more affected by the shock of a tight con- striction than are yoimg adults, and the exhaustion produced by the vomitless retelling of a high jejunal strangulation is in them more profound than when the vomit is in quantity and possibly even fseculent. In cases complicated by gangrene, perforation, and peritonitis, or in which resection has been performed, it is obvious that the gravity of the prognosis will be proportionate to the duration and height of the strangulation, the period elapsing between perforation and operation, and the length of the section of bowel removed.

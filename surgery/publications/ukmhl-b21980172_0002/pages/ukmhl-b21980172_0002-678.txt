622 HERNIA longer firm and resilient, and frequently the inguinal region external to the internal abdominal ring is weak and bulging. In very large scrotal hernias the sac, espe- cially the body and fundus, is tliick, vascular, and adherent, and the attempt to strip this out of the scrotum results in much troublesome oozing of blood and fat, which not only distends the cavity of the scrotum but also invades the layers of the coverings of the sac, making it impossible to evacuate the clot. It is thus often unwise to attempt the removal of such a sac ; it is better simply to detach it suffi- ciently at the neck to enable it to be ligated and divided here ; thus the risk of a scrotal hsematoma is avoided at the cost of a comparatively slight increase in the size of the scrotum. Tliis increase may be considerably reduced by the use of a large-sized Keetley's suspender, worn for some weeks after the operation. If the scrotum is very long and flabby, a section of it may be removed, but no attempt should be made to cut away the thick coverings of the sac, since much time must be lost in catching and tying divided vessels.

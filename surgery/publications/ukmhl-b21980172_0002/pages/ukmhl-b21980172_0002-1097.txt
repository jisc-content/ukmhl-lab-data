CERVICAL CARCINOMA 1019 cliildbearing, and is most uncommon in undoubted virgins. This is due to the fact that carcinoma of the cervix is superimposed on cervical " erosion." "^j Pathology. — Two forms of carcinoma are met with in the cervix, the squamous-celled and the columnar-celled. The first is by far the more common, the malignant epithelial cells being derived from the interpapillary down-growths of the hypertrophied epithelium that covers the erosion. (Figs. 588 and 589.) It is in the third stage of an erosion that carcinoma is most likely to occur {see p. 1009). The columnar-celled growth is derived ■ . • ; ■ from the glandular ^-^-'Z -- -J' - . - elements of the 4 , " cervix, and repre- sents about 2 per cent, of the total number of cases. Histologically, the squamous-celled type presents a number of masses of oval cells closely packed in alveolar spaces between the cervical tissues. These cells usually show no tendency to keratinize, and cell nests are un- common. (Fig. 589.) From the pri- mary growth exten- sion occurs both by lymphatic permeation and by infiltration. The lymphatic tract first affected, as a rule, is that extending outwards below the uterine artery towards the pelvic wall, from which it ascends to communicate with the lymphatics and glands between the external iliac artery and vein. These glands, together with others irregularly scattered in the broad ligament, are, therefore, the earliest affected by metastatic growth. It is, however, remarkable that in more than half of the patients dying of the disease no glandular involvement is found on autopsy (Leitch). In this respect, therefore, carcinoma of the cervix is much less malignant than carcinoma in many other parts of the body. Glandular enlargement, when found, is not necessarily carcino- Fig. 589.—Squamous-celled carcinoma of the cervix. The cells lie in masses closely packed. There is no keratinization or cell-nest formation.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE TONGUE 163 Between the anterior and posterior portions there is found at one period a well-marked V-shaped groove, which ultimately is occupied by some of the circumvallate papillae. Farther from the hypoblastic covering in the middle line a downgrowth of epithelium takes place which forms the median tubular portion of the thyroid gland, and which normally is responsible for the production of the small median depression at the apex of the V, called the foramen caecum (Fig. 334a). Under normal conditions this duct or canal, the thyro-glossal duct, should disappear, but it may persist, and cysts may arise in Fig. '334:(r.—more advanced stage of development of the tongue. 1, Foramen ca-'cum. any part of its course. Such cysts, thyro-glossal in origin, are some- times met with in the substance of the tongue. The muscles of the tongue arise in a curious way from the three posterior head segments. They grow forward into the fundament of the tongue, carrying with them their appropriate nerve, the 12th cranial or hvpoglossal. General anatomy of the tongue.—The body of the tongue is composed of striated muscle, of which the genio-hyo-glossus and the hyo-glossus are the largest extrinsic muscles. The dorsum is covered with a peculiar mucous membrane, and is divisible into two areas which correspond closely with the two portions developed respectively from the tuberculum impar—the lingual portion ; and that which arises from the 2nd and 3rd arches, the pharyngeal part—these two portions being separated by the V-shaped groove mentioned above, along which lie the circumval- late papillae.

OPERATION FOR MAMMARY CANCER 89 in diameter, accurately centred on the gTowtli and surrounding it at a safe distance, slightly tailing off into incision No. 2 above, and into No. 3 below. 2. A curvilinear incision for giving access to the axilla. ' The axilla is opened by turning forward a flap, consisting of skin and a thin layer of subcutaneous fat, whose base lies along the anterior axillary fold. The axillary incision begins at the lower edge of the gTeat pectoral, close to its insertion. It ends, also at the lower edge of the great pectoral, by join- ing the annular inci- sion. No. 1. It crosses the base of the axilla, and marks out a shallow semilunar flap of skin, whose con- vexity lies in the vault of the axilla not far from the edge of the latissimus dorsi. It affords perfect ac- cess to the axilla, and good drainage after- wards. 3. A linear inci- sion coming off from the lower and inner part of the annular incision and passing downwards for about 2 in. along the linea alba. Its object is to give access for the removal of the deep fascia over the upper part of the abdominal wall. Without it tliis important step in the operation cannot be properly carried out. Elevation of the skin flaps;—The sldn flaps are next under- mined in the mid-plane of the subcutaneous fat imtil there is exposed an area of the deeper subcutaneous fat, forming a circle 10 to 12 in. in diameter, with the primary growth at its centre. The exact anatomical limits of this dissection will, of course, vary with the situation of the growth in the breast. The assistant retracts the skin flaps as they are formed, and subsequently keeps them carefully wrapped in hot towels frequently renewed. Neglect of Fig. 284.—Recurrence of breast carcinoma following an inadequate operation. A portion only of the breast has been removed, and the axilla has not been cleared. Recurrence has taken place in the subclavian glands, and a mass of growth is seen pushing the pectorals forward.

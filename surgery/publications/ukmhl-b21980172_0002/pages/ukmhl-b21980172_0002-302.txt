268 THE CESOPHAGUS be fixed near the upper end but below the cricoid, then respiratory symptoms are absent. There is more or less dysphagia, and generally solid food cannot be swallowed. Occasionally the oesophagus is so completely obstructed that even fluids are regurgitated ; on the other hand, in certain cases, semi-solid food can be swallowed with ease. Constant vomiting may be excited by the lodgment of a foreign body in the upper part of the oesophagus. This was present in a case under my care. In another case the impaction of a tooth-plate in the cervical portion of the oesophagus (Fig. 350) gave rise to se- vere pain even when saliva was swallowed. Pain referred to the sternum in front, or between the scapute posteriorly, may be caused by impaction of a foreign body in the lower part of the oesophagus. When ulceration has occurred, vomit- ing of mucus streaked with blood may be present. Foreign bodies may remain lodged in the oesophagus for years and cause but little trouble. They may, however, soon after impaction, occasion complications accompanied by symptoms of great urgency. The secondary complications are— 1. Ulceration of the oesophageal wall at the site of impaction. 2. Formation of a submucous abscess. 3. Perforation of the wall of the oesophagus. 4. Peri-oesophageal inflammation and suppuration in the neck or thorax. 5. Erosion of the trachea or bronchi, with formation of fistulse. 6. Perforation of large vessels. 7. Inflammation or suppuration in the pleurae or pericardium. 8. Formation of a cicatricial stricture due to ulceration. The symptoms caused by these complications are those either of haemorrhage or of septic involvement of the neck or mediastina. Fig. 350.—Tooth plate removed by the author by cervical oesophagotomy. It had lodged opposite the seventh cervical vertebra.

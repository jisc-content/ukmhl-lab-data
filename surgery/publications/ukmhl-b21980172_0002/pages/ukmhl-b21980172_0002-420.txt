382 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM Hey Groves has recently called attention to the spread of carcinoma in the great omentum in advanced cases, and has shown that the growth may be disseminated by adhesion of the great omentum to neighbouring organs. Dobson and Jamieson have drawn attention to the tendency shown by the glands associated with the right gastro- epiploic artery to ex- tend into the great omentum, but there are no efferent vessels here that drain into glands other than those of the gastro- epiploic, subpyloric, or splenic groups. Lymphatic inva- sion is early and con- stant, and present in practically every case at the time of operation. Cuneo found the glands of the lesser curvature involved in 87 per cent, of cases exam- ined, those of the greater curvature in 66 per cent. Lenge- mann, in the exam- ination of 20 speci- mens removed by operation, found that the subpyloric group of glands was in- volved in 60 per cent, of cases, while Cuneo had found them to be afiected in 2 per cent. only. Jamieson and Dobson support Lengemann's observa- tions, which are in accord with my own experience. In a late stage of the disease the glands at the hilum of the liver, those around the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric glands, the biliary glands, the mesocolic and the lumbar glands may be involved.

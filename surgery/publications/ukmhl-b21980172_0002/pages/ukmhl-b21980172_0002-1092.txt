IOI4 THE UTERUS Leucorrlioea from the cervix is constant, and the enlarged corporeal glands in the hypertrophic stage also occasion a watery discharge, specially marked just after the " period." The latter is accompanied by an aching, bearing-down pain, referred to the lower abdomen, sacral region and vagina. Dyspareunia may be complained of when the uterus is tender, and conception is unlikely. There is a variety of the disease known as senile endometritis. In old age the uterine mucosa atrophies, nearly all the glands disappear, and the epithelium becomes flattened and often practically squamous. Owing to the absence of glands, the discharge from such a uterus, if infected, is puru- lent or seropurulent instead of being mucous as usual, and is very apt to become foul. Eventually the en- dometrium is re- placed by a thin layer of red granu- lation tissue from which occasional small haemorrhages may occur. Treatment. 1. Drugs and applications.— Ergot should be given to diminish tlie hypera^mia of the uterus and to check the excessive menstruation. Applications of iodine, iodized phenol, or carbolic acid may be made to the interior of the uterus, and the general health should be improved by suitable treatment. Soluble vaginal pessaries or tampons soaked in glycerine are sometimes used. Their rationale is doubtful as far as the corporeal inflammation is concerned. Curettage.—Where definite infection of the uterine cavity is present, the most rational treatment is curettage of the diseased mucosa, the coexistent endocervicitis being treated at the same time, as previously described. Auvard's self-retaining vaginal retractor having been inserted, the cervix is drawn down with two pairs of volsella forceps, and the direc- tion of the uterine cavity ascertained with the sound.

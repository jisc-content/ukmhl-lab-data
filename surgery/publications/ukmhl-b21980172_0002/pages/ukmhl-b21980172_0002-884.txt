8i6 THE KIDNEY rounded bosses corresponding to the hydroneplirotic pockets ; the pelvis is small and hidden. The interior of the hydronephrosis shows a single large cyst with pockets (pelvic type) (Fig. 541), or a small central cavity with numerous rounded chambers leading from it (kidney type). The lining membrane is smooth, opaque, and white. If the obstruction is situated at the lower end of the ureter this tube is thickened, dilated, and tortuous. A partial hydronephro- sis may be formed by the blocking of one segment of a double pelvis or the malformation of a calyx. Even in advanced cases there is a considerable amount of sclerosed kidney tissue present in the wall of the sac. The contents consist of urine with a specific gravity of 1005 or less. The fluid may be- come mixed with blood and form a hsematonephrosis. Symptoms.—In the early stage the kidney is not palpably enlarged, and either there are no symptoms or there is aching pain at the costo- muscular angle with per- sistent polyuria. Later, a rounded tumour moving with respiration and pre- senting the characters of a renal tumour (see p. 780) is found in the loin and may fill a large part of one side of the abdomen; it is not tender. The tumour may be constant in size and the urine normal in quan- tity, or there may be " intermittent" hydronephrosis in which the tumour for considerable periods completely disappears. At varying intervals—often after exertion or the drinking of a diuretic fluid— there are attacks of retention of urine in the sac, accompanied by severe pain, diminution in quantity of urine passed, and sometimes complete suppression. At the same time the tumour is large, tense, and tender. After some hours or days a large quantity of urine is passed, the pain subsides, and the tumour disappears.

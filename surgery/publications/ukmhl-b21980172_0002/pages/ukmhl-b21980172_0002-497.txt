EXTERNAL FISTULA 453 External Intestinal or F^cal Fistula An external or faecal fistula is an abnormal track leading from the lumen of the bowel to the surface of the skin, and giving exit to intestinal contents. As a rule, the opening in the bowel is a com- paratively small one, and, so long as the lumen of the gut beyond is unobstructed, only a small proportion of the intestinal contents escapes to the surface. Causes*—If the vitelline duct persists as a pervious tube when the umbilical cord separates after birth, a fistulous track is left in the form of a fatent Meckel's diverticulum (Fig. 398). As a rule, only Fig. 404.—Faecal fistula; bowel adherent to parietal peritoneum. a small quantity of clear mucus escapes from such an umbihcal fistula, and the discharge may cease spontaneously, or after the lining membrane of the track has been destroyed by the actual cautery. If fsecal matter escapes, the abdomen should be opened and the diverticulum excised, the orifice of communication with the ileum being closed by suture. A fistula may develop ajler injury of the bowel wall—for example, a contusion, a rupture, or a penetrating wound—or as a result of intes- tinal sutures having given way. If the bowel has become adherent to the parietal peritoneum before the fistula forms, the channel of communication is short (Fig. 404), and is often lined by the mucous membrane of the gut, which may even protrude from the opening. If, on the other hand, an abscess has developed in relation to the damaged portion of bowel, and has eventually worked its way to the surface, the fistulous track may be of considerable length, and is hned with granulation tissue, which yields a certain amount of pus (Fig. 405).

530 THE INTESTINES Cicatricial contraction of the mesocolon may fix the' tumour and bind it to the parietes, and this in turn may lead to kinking or bending of the bowel and cause obstruction. Fig. 429.—Annular stricture of bowel due to scirrhous cancer. (This and the next figure are from speciinens in the Museum of the Royal College o/ Surgeons, Edinburgh.) Fig. 430.—Mesial longitudinal sec- tion of same specimen as Fig. 429, to show occlusion of lumen by scirrhous cancer. Note hy- pertrophy of muscular coat above stricture. Cancer of the caecum is liable to imphcate the parietes, and in the retroperitoneal tissue celluUtis and abscess formation may occur, giving rise to symptoms which simulate appendicitis. The bursting 'of an abscess on the surface may estabhsh a fsecal fistula.

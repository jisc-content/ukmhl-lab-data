A foreign body sometimes, but rarely, acts in the same manner as a concretion, and a sharp- pointed foreign body such as a pin may per- forate the ap23endix mechanically (Fig. 436). When those processes which entail the passage of bacteria through the appendicular wall take place slowly and gradually, the natural defen- sive powers of the peritoneum are called into play (see under Peritonitis, p. 562). Around an inflamed appendix there is always a little turbid peritoneal exudate, rich in phagocytes, which is capable of dealing with the bacteria coming from the appendix, provided that an overwhelming amount of virulent material be not suddenly Fig. 43-i.—Section of a large appendi- cular concretion, showing the lami- nation. {SjfCL inrcfi ino2, ^7.

633 OPERATIONS FOR HERNIA occurred. The filigree may be placed upon or deep to the transversalis fascia, the latter being the simpler method. The operation is by no means so simple as in the case of the abdomen, owing to the narrow- ness and depth of the costo-iliac space and the imyielding nature of the fascia. The liHgree should measure about 4 to 5 in. in length and 3 to 4 in. in width, and should be of the same shape as the abdominal fihgree.

The incision and dissection are in all respects the same as for ligature of the respective arteries, the essential point being to obtain very free access to the parts. The difficulties are chiefly those of depth, the presence of the network of vessels, and the difliculty of effecting reduction. In dividing the constriction, care must be taken of the vessels and nerves in the vicinity, and, as these are numerous and their courses not always regular, it is wiser to depend on clear exposure of the parts than to be guided by any anatomical rule. In case of failure, abdominal section should be performed as for obturator hernia (see p. 650).

7i6 RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL growth may become Fig. 511.—Cancer of rectum. another favourite site is at the junction with the pelvic colon. Figs. 511, 512, 513, and 514 illustrate different appearances of cancer in different parts of the rectum. Pathology. — The growth is columnar- celled (Fig. 515), and originates in the glands of the mucosa. It spreads by (1) direct extension, (2) the lym- phatic channels, and (3) the blood stream. 1. Direct exten- sion.—The vertical and circumferential extent of rectal cancer varies greatly. When first seen, it may be a small nodule involving a very limited surface of the bowel wall; in other cases it may have surrounded the entire bowel — the annular type. Between these two all possible varieties exist. The growth, origin- ating in the mucosa, early invades the mus- cular coats (Fig. 516), and sooner or later the perirectal tissues. Thus the tissues of the ischio- rectal fossEe may be in- vaded, the presacral and precoccygeal tissues may be infiltrated, and the fixed to the pelvic walls and invade nerve trunks ; the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles, or uterus and vagina, according to sex, may be infected, and in high- lying growths the peritoneum may be involved. Earely the growth extends down the anal canal, and may protrude at the anus. There

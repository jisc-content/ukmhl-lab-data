162 THE TONGUE By W. H. CLAYTON-GREENE, B.A., M.B., B.C.Cantab., F.R.C.S.Eng. Development. — The tongue is developed from two separate elements in the floor of the primitive pharynx. The buccal or anterior portion arises during the third week (Keith) from the 1st branchial bar and interbranchial space, by the development of the tuberculum impar (Fig. 334), a median elevation. It was at one time held, as the name suggests, that there was a single unpaired Fig. 334.—Diagram showing development of the tongue. I, 'I'uberculum impar ; 2, posterior portion of tongue, developed from 2nd and 3rd arches. element entering into the formation of this part, but it has been shown that right and left elevations arise and fuse to form the tubercle. This early evidence of bilateral origin more clearly explains the rare conditions of bifid tongue and median cysts sometimes found. This portion, developed from the mandibular arch, is innervated by the special nerve of this part, the 5th, while the chorda tympani, a sensory nerve to the 1st branchial cleft, also supplies it. The fharynrjeal portion is developed from the fused ends of the 2nd and 3rd arches (Fig. 334). The glosso-pharyngeal—the nerve of the 3rd arch—supplies this part.

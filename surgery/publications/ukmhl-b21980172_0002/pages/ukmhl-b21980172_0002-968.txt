894 THE URETHRA have failed. If these attempts fail and no retention is present, the patient is replaced in bed and a brisk purge administered. A further trial will usually be successful. [ Most strictures are amenable to instrumental dilatation. Dilata- tion is carried out in three ways—(a) as intermittent dila- tation, (b) as rapid dilatation, (c) as continuous dilatation. Intermittent dilatation is the method of treatment of the majority of strictures. A bougie which fits the stricture is found, and progressively larger instru- ments, rising one size at each interview, are passed at inter- vals of at first four or five days, and then a week, and when the size reaches 18 or 20 F. a fortnight's, and then three weeks', interval is allowed. As the larger sizes are reached, the intervals are extended to two, three, four months, and finally six months and a year. Above the size of 22 F. steel instru- ments should be employed. The urethra should be washed before and after the passage of an instrument, and urinary antiseptics administered. Strictures which have not be- come tough and leathery from long duration, irregular treat- ment, or chronic inflammation Fig. -551.—Stricture of the bulbous wUl be completely relieved by urethra, with recent false passage, this method. Continuous dilatation is use- ful in cases where retention of urine has complicated a very narrow stricture. The patient is confined to bed, a filiform bougie passed and fastened in, and the urine trickles alongside. At intervals of twelve hours a progressively larger instrument is substituted until the stricture permits the entrance of a medium-sized bougie. Inter- mittent dilatation is then substituted. Rapid dilatation consists in passing bougies of increasing size in

CYSTS OF THE EPIDIDYMIS 947 There is usually a connexion between these cysts and the tubules of the epididymis or vasa efferentia, but in many cases no such con- nexion can be demonstrated by injection or dissection. Symptoms.—As a rule symptoms are absent, although there may be some pain. Usually attention is drawn to the cysts by chance, or by their gradual enlargement. They have frequently been mistaken for extra testes. They mostly occur in middle life or old age, and are of no importance. When of medium size, such a cyst presents on examination a rounded or lobulated, translucent, and painless cystic swelUng in the globus major ; it is attached to and moves with the body of the testis, wliich is more horizontal than usual. In small cysts, difficulty in the re- cognition of translucency and apparent solidity owing to tenseness may confuse the diagnosis ; large cysts may envelop the testis and simulate hydroceles of the tunica vaginalis, but may be distin- guished from them by the fact that on careful examination the testis can usually be found below and free from the cystic swelling. The cyst may sud- denly increase in size and become pain- ful after a slight blow ; this may be the first intimation to the patient that he has a pathological condition in the scrotum. Treatment.—These cysts are of slow growth and painless, and therefore may be left alone. If, however, they increase in size so as to cause incon- venience, they may be tapped from time to time, or, if the patient should desire it, they may be removed by dissection.

They arise between the layers of the tunica albuginea, and are probably due to injury and extravasation of blood. So rare are they that the diagnostic points are unknown. If necessary, the treatment is removal. <Fig. 568.)

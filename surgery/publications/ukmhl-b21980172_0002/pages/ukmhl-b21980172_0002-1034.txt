Bilocular Hydrocele (Fig. 570, 2) The bilocular hydrocele shows two pouches—one running down into the scrotum and having the relationships of an infantile hernia, and the other extending up into the abdomen either behind or in front of the peritoneal cavity. The abdominal pouch may be very large and extend above the umbilicus and down into the pelvis. The condition is rare. Haemorrhage may occur into the sac and form a bilocular hsematocele.

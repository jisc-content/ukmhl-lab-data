THE BREAST 74 upwards as high as possible along the outer wall of the axilla. The palmar surfaces are then pressed against the inner wall, and are slowly drawn downwards still firmly pressed against it. If enlarged glands are present they will be felt to slip past the descending finger-tips. Meantime the pec- torals must be re- laxed, the patient allowing the arm to hang loosely by her side. Retraction and elevation of the nipple.—Re- traction of the nip- ple occurs in one case out of four, and when present usually indicates proximity of the primary growth to the nipple. The nipple is first flat- tened, and then in- drawn, so that a conical depression replaces an eleva- tion (Fig. 275). The absence of retrac- tion (Fig. 277) pos- sesses no signifi- cance unless the growth is near the nipple, nor is its presence significant unless the nipple has previously been normal. In cases of atropine scirrhus, retraction of the nipple may precede the appear- ance of a tumour, and may be the earliest change noted. The whole breast is often drawn up towards the pectoral fascia, so that the nipple is situated on a higher level than that of the sound side. This sign is a consequence of extensive perilymphatic fibrosis in the lymphatics of the breast. I The foregoing signs may all be present in cases which are still Fig. 278.—Case of true primary carcinoma of each breast. The carcinoma on the patient's right side developed twelve years after the removal of a carcinoma of the left breast.

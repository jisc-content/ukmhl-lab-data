HERNIA 582 The second is more important. In both sexes the inguinal canal is occupied shortly before birth by a tubular process of peritoneum, which passes into the scrotum of the male, forming the processus vaginalis of the testis, and in the female into the labium majus. forming the canal of Nuck. The latter should be, and usually is, entirely obhterated; exceptionally it remains patent and forms the sac of a " congenital hernia of the canal of Nuck." The former should be obliterated as far as the testis, the remainder forming the tunica vaginalis of that organ.

If the process is obhterated at the upper pole of the testis but in free communication with the peritoneal cavity above this point, the sac is that of a " congenital hernia of the funicular process " (Fig. 443). Two other forms of congenital sac are met with, and are known as " infantile " and " encysted infantile." In the first, there is what looks hke an acquired sac immediately behind, and bulging into, the sac of a congenital hernia of the vaginal process or funicular process (Fig. 444). In the second, the neck of the vaginal process would seem to have been obhterated only at the internal

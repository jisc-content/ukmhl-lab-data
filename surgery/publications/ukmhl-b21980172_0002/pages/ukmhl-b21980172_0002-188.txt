FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE i6o lateral incision and the edge of the cleft on each side, is then thoroughly separated with a curved elevator. One blade of a pair of rectangular scissors is now introduced between the muco-perios- teum and the bone, and pushed gently backwards until the posterior border of the hard palate is reached. The scissors are then rotated until the other blade lies in the naso-pharynx above the soft palate, which is di- vided at its attachment to the hard palate (Fig. 333). When this step is completed, should the two halves of the soft palate fail to meet, the lateral relieving incisions must be extended backwards. Sutures of silver wire, fine salmon-gut, or silk are then inserted from behind forwards, and the suture line and raw lateral surfaces are given a coating of Whitehead's varnish. To relieve tension after the sutures have been tied, some surgeons pack the lateral inci- sions with gauze in order to push the flaps inwards; but, owing to the decomposition of the exudate absorbed by the gauze, this is not a satisfactory method. C. H. Mayo ties the flaps together with a piece of tape, which is then rotated so that the knot projects into the nasal cavity. Of late I have transfixed the flaps with two or four strands of fine silver wire, and fastened the ends over an aluminium plate which is bent over their lateral edges (Fig. 332). The advantages of this method, apart from the relief of tension, are the support given to the flaps by the wire and the accurate apposition of their approximated edges.

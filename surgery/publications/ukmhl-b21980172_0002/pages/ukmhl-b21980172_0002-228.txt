198 THE TONGUE in rare instances through it. Thence it extends down in front of the thyroid cartilage. When these thyroid tumours develop at the base of the tongue they are often solid and consist of vascular thyroid tissue exceedingly prone to bleed; severe and even fatal hsemorrhage has occurred spontaneously or as the result of incautious puncture. Cystic change may occur, and this is no doubt the origin of the so-called blood cysts of the tongue. Treatment.— Thyro- glossal cysts should be completely excised; this entails a dissection of the tubular canal, which may be found extending from the thyroid gland up to, or even beyond, the hyoid bone. Incomplete removal is always followed by recur- rence. Although it is rarelj^ necessary to continue the dissection beyond the hyoid bone into the tongue sub- stance, the operator must be prepared to do this, even dividing the hyoid bone if necessary. No treatment should be undertaken in the case of the solid thyroid tumours at the base of the tongue. Fig. 338.—Diagram showing " thyro- unless they are the cause glossal tract." of trouble. Not only is an 1, Thyro-giossai tract; 2, hyoid bone. Operation for their removal attended by a considerable amount of danger, but in some cases these tumours consist of the only functional thyroid tissue which the patient possesses, and removal of them has been followed by cachexia strumipriva. If, howerver, they give rise to serious hsemorrhage from ulceration, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing, they must be removed. When projecting from the surface, and especially if somewhat pedunculated, they may be snared off with a cautery wire. The more deeply situated tumours must be dissected out. Rose's

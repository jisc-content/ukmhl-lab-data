529 CARCINOMA OF THE COLON bowel (Fig. 429). In tliis form tlie lumen of the bowel may be almost completely occluded before the growth ulcerates. Colloid or encephaloid degeneration may occur in either form. On mesial longitudinal section, the lumen of the bowel is found contracted, it may be to the size of a crow-quill, by a well-defined ridge or ring representing the oldest, central portion of the growth, while above and below this the cancer extends in the mucous mem- brane for about an inch in each direction (Fig. 430). The bowel above is dis- tended, and its wall undergoes a moderate amount of hy- pertrophy. The mucous mem- brane is in a condition of ca- tarrh and may become ulcer- ated. The disease slowly spreads to the glands of the mesocolon, and also to the retroperitoneal Fig. 4'28.â€”Cancer of colon forming cauliflower-like growth projecting into lumen of bowel. {MuStitJii, Royal Coiit'gt- of Sitrgcoiis^ Edinburgh.^ glands, and when secondary deposits occitr they almost always appear first in the hver. Secondary growths are not infrequent in the omentum, mesenteries, and peritoneum, and I have met with one case in which both ovaries were also the seat of secondary deposits. These are usually attended with a considerable amount of ascites. Spread by continuity to adjacent viscera, such as the stomach, the bladder, the female pelvic organs, and to neighbouring coils of small intestine, is not uncommon. 2/

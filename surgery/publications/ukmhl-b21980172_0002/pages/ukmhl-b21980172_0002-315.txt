279 FIBROUS STRICTURE diagnosis is confirmed, after the usual routine examination to exclude other causes of oesophageal stenosis, oesophagoscope and the by the introduction of the passage of bougies. If the patient is able to swallow fluids, a solution of bismuth given by the mouth and the employ- ment of X-rays may give valuable information as to the site and extent of the stricture. Treatment. 1. By mechanical dilatation. —This treatment should be attempted at first in all permeable fibrous stric- tures of the a?sophagus. A medium-sized flexible gum-elastic bougie with conical tip is passed down the oesophagus, and very gentle attempts are made to engage its point in the stricture. If any difficulty is experienced, a smaller- sized bougie must be tried. If that fails, a filiform bougie or catgut whip should be used. A stiff graduated bougie (Fig. 3.55, b) will sometimes be found tlie most useful in- strument in locating and engaging the mouth of the stricture. The whip may be used alone, or be di- rected to the stricture through a hollow bougie which is first passed down to the site of the obstruc- tion. If the bougie and whip fail to enter the stricture, the oesophagoscope should be passed down and attempts made to see the opening. If it be impossible to find the Fig. 354.—Tubular stricture of the middle third of the oesophagus resulting from the action of a corrosive. {London Hospital/'athol'gkal Pcpartnicnl.)

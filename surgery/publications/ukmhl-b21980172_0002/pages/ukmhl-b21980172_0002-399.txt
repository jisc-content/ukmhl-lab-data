DUODENAL ULCER : ETIOLOGY 361 Among 273 cases collected by Collin, 16 were under a year. In these the ulcers were acute, usually complicating some septic disease and found post mortem. Duodenal ulcer as seen clinically, the chronic ulcer, is a disease of adult life, the patient most often coming under surgical observation between the ages of 30 and 50. In many, however, symptoms were noticed much earlier in life ; for instance, in one patient of 53 upon whom I operated, symptoms had been present for thirty-five years, and in another of 68 for forty-eight. Sex.—All are agreed that men are more often affected than women. Fig. 378.—Chronic ulcer, situated on the posterior wall of the first part of the duodenum, which had eroded the pancreatico- duodenal artery. A bristle is in the artery ; the body of the pancreas has been displaced downwards. (Loiidou Hospital rathologkal Institutt.) Of Mayo Robson's cases 86 per cent, were males, of the Mayos' 73 per cent., and of Moynihan's 73'6 per cent. Among my own cases operated up to December, 1911, 70 in number, 10 were in women. This may be con- nected with the greater frequency of diseases of the appendix in men. Mayo has observed that the first portion of the duodenum in men is nearly always ascending, and suggests that the alkaline reaction of the bile and pancreatic juice more readily neutralizes the acid cliyme in the upper duodenum in women than in men.

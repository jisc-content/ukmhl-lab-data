THE PROSTATE 920 important differences, and afterwards other symptoms are added. In the first place, it may be stated briefly that the symptoms of carcinoma are much more rapidly and steadily progressive than those of chronic enlargement, and that the interference with micturition is more pro- nounced than the physical signs would lead one to expect. Pain is a more marked and earlier feature in malignant disease than in chronic enlargement. It is referred to the end of the penis, to the hj^ogas- trium and the perineum, and, although in- creased by mic- turition, is not relieved by it. It is also very resistant to treatment, being due to infiltra- tion of the nerve plexus by the carcinoma- tous growth. With involve- ment of the sci- atic nerveSj pain extending down the leg occurs. True in- continence of urine may be set up in carci- noma, due to de- struction of the bladder spliincters, but only towards the end of the disease. Haematuria is rare unless there is ulceration of the growth, but it has nothing to distinguish it from the other causes of bladder haemorrhage. As a rule it is slight. Pieces of growth may be passed per urethram. Pyuria is always present when the growth has ulcerated into the bladder, but the cystitis rarely reaches a severe degree. Interference with defaecation is similar to that occurring in cases of simple enlargement, but may go on to complete obstruction. Ulceration into the bowel leads to haemorrhage and discharge per rectum.

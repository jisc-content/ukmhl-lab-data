TUMOURS 35 adenoma are not numerous enough to impair the validity of the rule. Moreover, in view of the affinity of this tumour with sarcoma, excision of the breast is often the best treatment. For a large cyst of the breast, removal of the whole organ is the only procedure which gives anything like absolute security. When a cyst is excised a microscopical examination of the cyst wall must on no account be omitted even when the characters of the excised cyst appear to be innocent. TUMOURS OF THE BREAST On its clinical side the subject of tumours of tlie breast is complex and difHcult, while pathologically it is relatively simple, though its literature is puzzling owing to a redundant nomenclature. The following list appears to contain all tumours primary in the breast. It might be lengthened by adding tumours of extraneous origin, such as secondary melanotic sarcoma, or angioma of the skin invading the breast, or by wrongly assuming that secondary accidents and degenerations, such as colloid change in carcinoma or cystic changes in fibro-adenoma, are fundamental characters. A. Innocent Tumours. (rt) Of epithelial origin, wholly or mainly. 1. Duct papilloma. 2. Pure adenoma. (b) Of connective-tissue origin, wholly or mainly. 1. Fibro-adenoma. 2. Soft fibro-adenoma. 3. Fibroma (probably a fibro-adenoma from which epithe- lium has disappeared). 4. Lipoma. 5. Myxoma. B. Malignant Tumours. (a) Of epithelial origin. Carcinoma. i. Spheroidal-celled, originating in the acini, ii. Columnar-celled, originating in the ducts. (6) Of connective-tissue origin. Sarcoma, round-, spindle-, or mixed-celled, or containing cartilage (chondro-sarcoma) or bone. Ernest Shaw has well summarized the relations of the mammary epithelium to tumour formation. He points out that the epithelium in a duct or acinus may grow (a) outwards, away from the lumen, or (6) inwards, into the lumen. In the former case the cells may in

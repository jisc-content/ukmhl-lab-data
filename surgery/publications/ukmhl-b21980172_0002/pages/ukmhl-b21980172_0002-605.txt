APPENDIX ABSCESS: TREATMENT 551 1909 chart (Fig. 438). The figures given here are not those of selected cases of spreading peritonitis in an early stage, but they embrace all the cases admitted to hospital with diffuse peritonitis, however desperate, which were subjected to operation. Treatment of appendicitis with local abscess.—An appen- dix abscess must, like an abscess anywhere else, be opened as soon as a diagnosis has been arrived at. Delay involves greater risks than immediate action, the possible results being rupture of the abscess into the general peritoneal cavity, into the bowel, or into the bladder; the formation of a subphrenic abscess ; retroperitoneal celluli- tis ; and the formation of dense adhesions which may later give rise to intestinal obstruction and other troubles. The incision is most conveniently placed over the spot at which the pus is judged to be closest to the sur- face and should take the form of a muscle- splitting operation. For the majority, either McBurney's " gridiron " opening, or an opening which separates the fibres of the right rectus muscle below the umbilicus, is best; abscesses situated far back in the loin may be reached through a " split-muscle " opening similar to that of McBurney ; and occasionally it is advisable to open the abscess by an incision through the posterior vaginal fornix. In a neglected case the abdominal wall may be oedematous, and the skin may even be reddened over a pointing abscess, so that the pus can be reached by little more than a sldn incision. In others the parietal peritoneum forms part of the abscess wall, so that the pus can be readily evacuated without opening the general peritoneal cavity. In most cases, however, the peritoneal cavity is opened into as soon as the parietal peritoneum is incised. When this happens the general cavity must be carefully packed off with gauze strips and the abscess gently Fig. 438.—Diagram of mortality percentages in operation for removal of the appendix.

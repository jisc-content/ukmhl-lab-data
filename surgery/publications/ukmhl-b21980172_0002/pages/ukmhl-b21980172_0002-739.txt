INTERNAL HEMORRHOIDS: TREATMENT 68i loss of blood, and the saturated condition of the dressing. It must be remembered that considerable haemorrhage may occur into the rectum before appearing outside. It is unusual, and is probably not more frequent after one method of operation than another. The treat- ment must be prompt. The patient is anaesthetized, the rectum irrigated to remove all clots, and examination made for the bleeding-point. If this can be found, it should be ligatured. In all probability bleeding will have ceased, and all that can be done is to pass a tube, to which a petticoat of lint has been tied, into the rectum, and to pack gauze between the tube and the petticoat to prevent a recurrence.

(6) Infection.â€”Severe sepsis rarely occurs, but occasionally, especi- ally when the operation is undertaken for inflamed or sloughing jjiles, some septic infection may ensue and lead to troublesome ulceration, which will increase the tendency to stricture. Specific infections, e.g. tetanus and pysemia, have been known to occur, but they are extremely rare. (c) (Edematous tags of skin at the anal margin are frequently present within a few days of the operation. These are due either to an inflam- matory disturbance or to interference with the venous circulation. They occur alike after the ligature and the Whitehead operation. In the great majority of cases, if the operation has been properly performed, they subside under the application of astringent lotions. In a few cases, however, they may have to be removed under local anaesthesia.

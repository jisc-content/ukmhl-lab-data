THE SALIVARY GLANDS 250 indication that the tumour has taken on the true characteristics- of malignancy, and the prognosis is then correspondingly grave. The histological appearances of mixed tumours are exceedingly variable. Their name is derived from the fact that on microscopical examination both epithelial and connective-tissue ele- ments are seen. Representatives of various types of connective tissue Fig. 343.â€”Mixed tumour of the parotid gland. are found, particularly fibrous, myxomatous, and cartilaginous, and epithelial cells are seen arranged in columns or in groups. Some of these show a tendency to cell-nest formation, others to colloid degeneration. Much discussion has taken place as to the origin of these cells. Ribbert holds that they are genuine epithelial cells, derived from the normal cells of the gland. He supports his argument by the assertion that prickle processes can be demonstrated between adjacent cells and that the separate groups are bounded by a membrana propria. Volkmann and others assert that the cells cannot be shown to resemble any definite epithelial type, and that they must therefore

HARE-LIP: OWEN'S OPERATION 141 border of the restored lip, and the raw surface on the opposite side of the cleft is adjusted in such a way that it fits into the angle made by the inversion of the flap. The direction of the scar is shown in Fig. 311. To obtain a good cosmetic result in this, as in every other Fig. 310.—Edmund Owen's operation. Mucous mem- brane removed from whole length of outer margin of cleft ; large thick flap cut from inner margin. Fig. 311.—Edmund Owen's operation. Flap from left side adjusted along right half of lip.

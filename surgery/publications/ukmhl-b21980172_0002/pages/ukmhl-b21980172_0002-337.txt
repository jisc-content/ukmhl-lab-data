301 LYMPHATIC GLANDS ally there are one or two glands on the bare area of the stomach. On tracing the upper coronary glands backwards they become continuous with the glands around the coeliac axis. 2. The coeliac glands, situated at the upper border of the pancreas, have been divided into three groups, the middle (around the coeliac axis), left (on the splenic), and right (on the stem of the hepatic artery) suprapancreatic. To the left suprapancreatic group (splenic) belong the glands occasionally present in the gastro-splenic omentum. The Fig. 363.â€”Lymphatic glands and lymphatic areas of stomach. n. Lower coronary glands ; b, upper coronary glands; c, paracardial glands ; d, outlying glands of left suprapancreatic group: e, right gastro-epiploic glands : /, subpyloric glands ; suprapyloric gland. efferents from the suprapancreatic glands pass to the receptaculum chyli and communicate freely with the superior mesenteric glands. 3. The rigid gastro-epiploic group of glands lie below the artery of tlie same name. They are from four to seven in number, and rarely extend to the left farther than the middle of the greater curvature, though they have a tendency to stray downwards between the layers of the great omentum. The vessels from these glands pass to the subpyloric group. 4. The subpyloric glands are situated to the right of the pylorus, in the angle between the first and second parts of the duodenum, in front of the head of the pancreas and in close relation to the bifurcation of the gastro-duodenal artery. They receive lymphatic vessels from the pylorus and duodenum and the efferent vessels from the right gastro-epiploic glands. Their efierents pass to the supra- pancreatic and superior mesenteric glands.

A SYSTEM OF SURGERY THE BREAST By \V. SAMPSON HANDLEY, M.S.Lond., F.R.G.S.Eng. ANATOMY OF THE BREAST The mamma is an organ, developmentally arising from the skin, intercalated in the thickness of the subcutaneous fat, and probably representing a highly developed group of sebaceous follicles. It is firmly attached to the skin at the nipple, and is connected to it at numerous other points by fibrous septa called the suspensory ligaments of Astley Cooper. The size of the breast is no index to its secreting power, since prominent mammae often consist mainly of fat. Each mamma consists of from twelve to twenty lobes, which are really separate sector-shaped glands, packed closely together in one plane, their ducts converging upon the nipple, and opening by separate orifices upon its summit. The autonomy of each lobe is an important fact, since disease of one or more of the lobes is thereby hindered from spreading to the adjoining ones. In some cases of disease a sector-shaped tumour may be observed mapping out the limits of the afiected lobe or lobes. It is possible sometimes to excise the diseased lobes of the breast without interfering with the healthy ones. The main duct of each lobe, before opening upon the nipple, is dilated to form a small reservoir or ampulla, J to ^ in. in diameter, the undue distension of which may give rise to galactocele, or, if lactation is not in progress, to a retention cyst containing serous fluid. Each lobe of the breast is composed of a number of lobules which bear to the main duct of the lobe tlie relation of a bunch of grapes to its stalk. A lobule of the breast consists of a small rounded packet of fibrous b

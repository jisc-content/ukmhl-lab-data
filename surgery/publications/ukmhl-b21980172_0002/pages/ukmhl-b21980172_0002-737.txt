INTERNAL HEMORRHOIDS: TREATMENT 679 inflammation is absent and the number of jjiles is limited. It should be reserved for those cases in which the piles are not more than four or five in number, and form definite tumour masses, with healthy mucosa between them. On the other hand, where practically the whole mucosa is the seat of ha3morrhoidal changes, and where prolapse is great, Whitehead's operation will give a better result. To perform the ligature operation the sphincters are thoroughly stretched and the piles allowed to protrude. Each pile is seized in ring-forceps. A curved incision is made through the cutaneous ring formed by the everted anal canal about midway between its outer margin and the muco-cutaneous junction corresponding to the base of Fig. 494. Fig. 4'J5. The operation for removal of an internal pile. {See text.) the pile, the ends of the incision terminating in the mucous membrane at the sides of the pile (Fig. 494). The incision is deepened through the subcutaneous tissue to the external sphincter muscle, wlaich is recog- nized and avoided (Fig. 495). By continuing the dissection up the anal canal a pedicle containing the vessels of the pile is formed. This is transfixed, ligatured tightly, and the pile cut away not too closely to the ligature, for fear the latter should slip from the stump. The stump will separate, with the ligature, in about ten days' time. 3. Excision of each individual haemorrhoid is a modification of the ligature operation. The pile is seized longitudinally by a long narrow clamp, and its upper pole, including the main vessels, is trans- fixed and ligatured just above the end of the clamp. The projecting

THE PERITONEUM 574 diaphragm is sometimes perforated, so that the subphrenic and pleural collections of pus communicate with one another. Exploratory puncture with an aspirating needle cannot be too severely condemned. The procedure is far more dangerous than an exploratory operation, and a negative result is valueless. Treatment.—The abscess must be opened as soon as its presence has been determined. The actual site of the opening will be indicated by the situation of the pus, as shown by percussion, position of ten- derness, palpation, and X - ray examination. Occasionally such an abscess, if coming for- ward, can be reached by an incision through the anterior abdominal wall below the costal margin, and posterior- ly situated collections have been reached by an incision below the costal margin behind, though in doing this there is risk of acci- dentally wounding and infecting the pleura. The method adapt- ed to the majority of cases is that of de- liberately traversing the pleural cavity and diaphragm. The struc- tures which have to be traversed are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 441. If the patient is very ill the operation can be done under local anaesthesia. The operation, briefly, consists in resecting portions of two or three ribs over the site of the abscess, opening the pleural cavity, suturing the diaphragm to the costal pleura, so as to shut o£E the pleural cavity, incising the diaphragm, and inserting a drainage-tube. Some surgeons prefer to perform this operation in two stages, the first stage being directed to shutting ofE the pleural cavity, and the second to opening the abscess. The danger of infecting the pleura in the one- stage operation has been exaggerated, and there is little to be said in favour of the two-stage procedure. In some cases an empyema is present in addition to the subphrenic abscess ; when this is so, doubt Fig. 441.—Diagram showing structures tra- versed in opening a subphrenic abscess.

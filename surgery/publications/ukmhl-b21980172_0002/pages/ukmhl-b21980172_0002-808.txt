GALL-BLADDER AND BILE-DUCTS 748 but more usually it ulcerates through the duct and bowel wall just above the duodenal papilla (Fig. 529). A calculus in the ampulla of Vater may obstruct the opening and throw the bile and pancreatic duct into a continuous channel; it is then a potent cause of pancreatitis. (Fig. 519.) Remote consequences of gall-stones. — Fistulas may be external or internal; spontaneous or the result of surgical -My Fig. 526.—The first part of the duodenum is laid open, showing a large opening into the gall- bladder, which is occupied by a faceted calculus. Lying free in the bowel is the sister calculus, which became impacted in the ileum and caused the death of the patient from acute obstruction. The facets on the two calculi exactly correspond. {FfOJU a spt'ciintu in Ihe Museidn oj the Unh'ci-aity of Diirham Cotlege of Medicine.) interference; con- stant or recur- ring ; and biliary or mucoid or muco-purulent. External fis- tulas, when spon- taneous, almost invariably depend on suppuration of the gall-bladder associated with an obstruction in the cystic duct. They usually open just above the umbilicus, but sometimes appear over the normal the loin, or even situation of the gall-bladder, in the iliac fossa between the lower ribs. External fistulfe, secondary to surgical interference, may be mucoid or biliary. In the former, either an obstruction in the cystic duct has been overlooked, or the gall-bladder has been fixed to the sldn of the abdominal wall instead of to the peritoneum. The latter depend upon some obstruction remaining in the common duct, due to calculus, stricture, or involvement by pancreatitis.

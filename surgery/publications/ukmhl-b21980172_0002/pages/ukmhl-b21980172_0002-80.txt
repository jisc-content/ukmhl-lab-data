54 THE BREAST Dissemination of Breast Cancer It is of primary importance to know the mode and channels by which breast cancer spreads from the primary focus and gives rise to secondary deposits, for in the absence of this knowledge it is impossible to devise a scientific operation for the extirpation of the disease. Until recently the subject of dissemination was enveloped in con- fusion and uncertainty. It was believed that the secondary deposits situated near the primary gi'owth arose from particles carried along the lymphatics by the current ; while more dis- tant deposits, such as those in the liver, were accounted for by the embolic theory. According to this theory, particles of the primary growth reach the blood by way of the axillary and su- praclavicular glands, and are carried by the force of the circulation to re- mote districts where their cells proliferate and pro- duce secondary nodules. Although, in 1889, Heid- enhain found lymphatics filled with cancer cells ex- tending from the breast to the pectoral fascia in two-thirds of the cancer- ous breasts he examined, this important observa- tion remained isolated, and had no effect upon the general doctrine of dissemination. Stiles, whose work upon the surgical anatomy of the breast led to such great operative improvements, writing in 1889, continued to share the embolic view of dissemination. Although it has been conclusively shown, especially by M. B. Schmidt, that cancer cells often obtain access to the blood-stream, upon a close examination the embolic theory presents many diffi- culties. Stephen Paget pointed out that, though embolism must be an impartial process to which all the organs are liable, certain Fig. 271. â€” Columnar - celled adeno-carci- noma of the breast originating in the smaller ducts.

GASTRIC CARCINOMA: DISSEMINATION 381 removed by operation, Borrmann found the cut edge of the duodenum involved in 20. On the other liand, carcinoma of the cardiac end of the stomach frequently involves the oesophagus, and vice versa. Growth extends in the submucosa early and widely ; while the induration marks the limit of infiltration of the mucous membrane, the growth extends in the submucosa for several centimetres beyond. The area of involvement of the serous and muscular coat is always less. Adjacent organs may be directly affected, most frequently the pancreas, then the liver and colon, rarely the spleen. Fig. 386.—" Leather bottle " stomach. Adhesions are present in about 80 per cent, of cases at the time of death, and constitute an important method of spread. Lymphatic spread.—The lymphatic system of the stomach has already been described (p. 300). In carcinoma of the pylorus and lesser curvature the lower coronary group of glands is first affected. Occasionally a lymphatic vessel runs past this group of glands and terminates directly in one of the upper coronary set; this is well shown in Fig. 387, a photograph of a portion of the stomach which I removed. In carcinoma of this region the subpyloric glands are usually affected, and lymphatic vessels may run dii'ectly to the supra- pancreatic glands and even to the biliary chain.

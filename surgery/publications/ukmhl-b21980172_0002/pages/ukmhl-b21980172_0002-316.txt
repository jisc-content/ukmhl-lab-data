THE (ESOPHAGUS 28o opening by this means, or to pass any bougie, then further opera- tive treatment must be considered. If a bougie passes through the stricture, dilatation can be pro- ceeded with. Dilatation can be ei?ected either (a) by passing bougies in gradually increasing sizes at intervals of several days (intermittent dilatation), or (6) by inserting and leaving in position suitable cathe- ters through which the pa- tient can be fed (continuous dilatation). In children and in other cases in which much diffi- culty or distress is occa- sioned by the passage of the bougie, the latter me- thod will be found most serviceable. (a) Intermittent dilata- tion.â€”The bougie is passed and left in position for a few minutes ; a larger size is then introduced and kept in for a similar period ; this is removed, and after a couple of days' interval a further trial is made with a bougie of slightly larger calibre. By this means gra- dual dilatation is effected. Special forms of bougies have been invented in order to overcome the difficulty of gradual dilatation. The so-called " railway " bougie (Fig. 355, a) consists of a hollow gum-elastic bougie, which is passed over a small solid bougie already intro- duced through the stricture as a guide. By the successive passage of larger ones the stricture can sometimes be rapidly dilated. Fig. 355. -Bougies for dilating the oesophagus.

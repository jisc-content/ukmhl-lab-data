STRANGULATION BY BANDS 4«3 most acute forms of intestinal obstruction (p. 465). Examination of the abdomen seldom reveals any localizing signs, and rectal examina- tion is likewise negative. It is not uncommon, however, for a con- siderable quantity of blood to be passed by the rectum, and in children this may suggest the possibility of intussusception. A history that Fig. 41-2.—Portion of small intestine strangulated by vermiform appendix acting as a band. i^Anatoinital Muicum, Ujiiz'crsity of Edinbttr^li,) the patient has previously suffered from some form of peritonitis, especially tuberculous, sliould suggest the presence of a band. Treatment.—In the great majority of cases, it is impossiljle to arrive at a. positive diagnosis as to the cause of the obstruction before the abdomen is opened. The escape of blood-stained fluid on opening the peritoneal cavity is strongly suggestive of the presence of a band or of volvulus. Any loop of contracted intestine that can be found sliould be traced upwards until the seat of obstruction is reached. If a band is discovered, it should, if possible, be divided between forceps and tlie secured ends removed.

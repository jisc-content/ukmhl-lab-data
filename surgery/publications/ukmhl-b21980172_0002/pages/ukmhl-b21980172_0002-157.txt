MEDIAN HARE-LIP 129 examples occur in families, heredity usually plays a powerful part in its causation, and in such instances the tendency is generally transmitted by the mother. Two ana- tomical varieties are met with, the me- dian and the lateral. ■ Fig. 302.—Same case as in Fig. 301. Median Hare-Lip One of the rarest of malformations in the human being,this occurs as a natural characteristic in the animal from which it derives its name. Being dvie to persist- ence of the notch between the two globular processes (Fig. 295), it can never extend quite to the columella of tlie nose, for this is developed by the e 1 e V a t i o n of the (mesial) fronto-nasal bud. In the classi- cal example de- picted in Figs. 301 and 302 it will be seen to involve the lip for a little less than half its depth. True median hare- lip must not be con- fused with another rare median defect of the upper lip in which the clef t. though anatomically median, is embryo- logically due to a bilateral hare-lip complicated by an entire absence of the lower end of the fronto-nasal process and the premaxillary / Fig. 30.'5. -Median defect of upper lip due to imperfect development of the premaxilla.

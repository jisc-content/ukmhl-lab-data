io68 THE OVARY Teratomatous cysts (dermoid cysts; embryomas).—The fact that the ovary is the normal seat of undifEererLtiated embryonic cell seclusions probably explains the extraordinary diversity of growths originating in that organ. If so, many ovarian tumours not always considered as teratomatous might be included in this category (e.g. ovarian cyst-adenomas). Setting aside these more debatable classes, there remain two whose embryonic origin is admitted by all, viz. the simple dermoid cyst and the multilocular cyst-embryoma. Of these the simple dermoid is much the commoner. It is unilocular Fig. 615.—Multilocular ovarian cyst-adenoma. as a rule, and its wall is formed of stretched ovarian tissue (Fig. 617). At one part of it the " embryonic rudiment " presents as an irregular projection into the cavity, covered by a coarse skin containing a large number of sebaceous follicles. Many hairs grow from this area, and projecting from it or embedded in it may be found one or several teeth more or less well formed, and set into an irregular plate of bone (Fig. 618). Microscopical investigation of the embryonic area, besides showing a definite skin (Fig. 619), may reveal other tissues such as cartilage, muscle bundles, or nerves. The rest of the cyst is usually lined with a flattened or definitely cubical epithelium. It contains a yellow fat, liquid when it is first removed from the body, but rapidly hardening afterwards, and then resembling cocoa butter. Embedded in it is a quantity of coarse reddish or brownish hair.

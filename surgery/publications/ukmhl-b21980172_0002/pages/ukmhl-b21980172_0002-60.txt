THE BREAST 38 The process resembles superficially what is seen in duct papilloma, but is really entirely different. In a fibro-adenoma the actively growing element is fibrous tissue, and the epithelium plays a merely passive role. In duct papilloma, on the contrary, the ingrowing papillae present well-developed and actively growing epithelium, and the fibrous core of the papilla serves merely to nourish the active epithelium. A lack of appreciation of this distinction has led to endless confusion in works upon diseases of the breast. Discharge from the nipple—characteristic evidence of secretory activity of the epithelium in duct papilloma—does not occur in fibro-adenoma. The A B c Fig. 261 (schematic).—Three stages in the history of the common intra- canalicular fibro-adenoma. a, Ingrowth of the fibrous convolutions into the duct, b, Their full development, c, Consolidation of the tumour by fusion of the apposed processes. The chink-like spaces so prominent in b have almost disappeared. mutual pressure of the closely packed fibrous ingrowths in a fibro- adenoma ultimately leads to the atrophy and destruction of the thinned epithelium which covers them. The narrow intervening chinks now become bridged by newly organized fibrous tissue, and the lobulated processes are consoHdated into a solid fibrous tumour in which, here and there, stellate spaces lined by unobliterated epi- thelium remain. In this stage a transverse section appears to the naked eye soUd and homogeneous (Fig. 261, c). In an old fibro-adenoma all traces of epithelium may become obliterated, and the tumour is then classified as a fibroma. A rarer variety of hard fibro-adenoma, called by American authors the feri- canalicular fibro-adenoma, which is clinically indistinguishable from the common variety, presents active overgrowth of the fibrous tissue surrounding the acini and small ducts of one or more lobules of the

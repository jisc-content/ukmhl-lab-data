STRICTURE 891 to a narrow circular band, but it may measure an incH or more in old-standing cases, or rarely almost tlie whole length of the anterior urethra is sclerosed. Complete obliteration of the lumen has been recorded, but is very rare. The following terms have been applied, viz. : " annu- lar " stricture, a fine band involving the whole circum- ference (Fig. -550); " bridle " stricture, an isolated band stretching across the lumen ; " resilient " stricture, an elastic stricture which recon- tracts quicldy after dilata- tion ; "cartilaginous" stric- ture, a hard fibrous mass, usually of considerable extent. In an " irritable " stricture there is a rise of temperature or even a rigor after each instrumentation. An " im- passable " stricture is one through which no instrument can be passed. A stricture may affect the whole circum- ference of the urethra or only the floor, roof, or lateral walls. The lumen is central or excentric, and it may be tortuous. The histological changes consist in proliferation of the epithelium, which becomes squamous, and sclerosis of the subepithelial tissue, the fibrous tissue invading the submucous tissue, and the erectile tissue of the corpus spongiosum. The urethra behind the stricture shows chronic in- flammation and dilatation. Vegetations and ulcerations are frequently present. The Fig. 550.â€”Annular stricture of the bulbous urethra.

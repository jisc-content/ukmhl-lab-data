But as the ^- , ulceration progresses and / " ■ the discharges become more copious the desire to go to stool will be felt more and more frequently during the day, until it may be that a call must be answered every hour. The quantity of pus and blood passed will vary considerably, de- pending upon the extent and depth of the ulceration. Pain is not a marked fea- ture in the early stages, but later some pain in the perineum, in the back, or radiating down the thighs is very common. Reflex urinary symptoms may be present. A progressive loss of weight and strength due to the continual discharges, the loss of appetite and insufficiency of food, and the unhealthy life which has to be led by these sufferers, will certainly be present sooner or later, i"^ In a considerable number of cases some narrowing of the lumen of the bowel will occur, and the symp- toms of chronic intestinal obstruction add to the suffering and malnutrition of the patients. Perirectal suppuration is common. Distant foci of inflamma- tion, particularly involving the joints, not infrequently occur, as they may in any infective disease.

THE SPLEEN I20 A sarcoma arising in the spleen will grow rapidly and give rise to a hard, irregular tumour. Metastasis will occur early, and wasting with cachexia may be the only symptoms to attract attention. Pain is not likely to occur in the early stages unless the tumour is on the surface and the peritoneum is involved. In some cases a leucocytosis together with eosinophilia has been noted. The diagnosis of sarcoma will usually be made by a process of exclusion. Splenic anaemia, leukaemia, and malarial enlargement can be excluded by the absence of the characteristic changes in the blood, or by the history of the case. Prognosis and treatment.â€”If recognized early, and if splenectomy is performed before metastases have formed, the prognosis may be not unfavourable. Johnston has collected 12 cases of splenec- tomy for sarcoma, with 9 recoveries from the operation. It is probable that if the after-histories of these cases were traced it would be found that death from recurrence had ultimately resulted.^ BIBLIOGRAPHY Ballance, Lancet, 1896, i. 484.

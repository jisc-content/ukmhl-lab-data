I050 THE FALLOPIAN TUBE proliferation and oedema, and later by fibrosis. The tube curls down- wards and becomes densely adherent to the ovary, the back of the broad ligament, the uterus, the intestine, especially the pelvic colon, and the omentum. The ovary is often cystic as well. The result is a conglomerate mass lying to one side of the back of the uterus, and commonly referred to as a " diseased appendage." Clinical features. Acute salpingitis. Symptoms. — The symptoms of acute salpingitis are those of pelvic peritonitis. The onset is sudden, with severe pain referred to the lower abdomen, the tem- middle line. Resonance is only partially impaired over it, because it is largely made up of adherent coils of gut. At the end of a week it may have attained the level of the umbilicus, and have become much more defined and dull. On vaginal examination nothing but great tender- ness to one or both sides of the uterus is first noticed, but later a definite swelling or swellings can be distinguished, extending from the sides of the uterus into the pouch of Douglas. Eventually, in bilateral disease, a large, very tender mass is felt behind and to the sides of the uterus, which it tends to push forwards. The mass is continuous with that felt from the abdomen, and always lies in front of the rectum, which it may compress against the sacrum. perature and pulse- rate are high, and there may be some sickness. The bowels are constipated, or when opened occa- sion much pain. Micturition may also be painful. The plicae are swollen and distorted, and the subepithelial tissues crowded with inflammatory cells. The epithelium lies proliferated, forming many gland-like spaces. Fig. 610.—Sclerotic salpingitis. Physical signs.— From the outset there are tender- ness and rigidity over the lower ab- domen, perhaps more marked on one side. After a day or two an indefinite swelling rises above the pubis. This swelling may be mesial in position, or more marked to one side of the

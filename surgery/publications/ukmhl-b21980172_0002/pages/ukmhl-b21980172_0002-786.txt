RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL 728 all other methods fail, operative treatment must be advised, if the symptoms are severe. The object of the operation is to cut all the nerves going to the affected skin. A curved incision is made on each side of the anus, just externally to the affected part, and prolonged forwards and backwards, leaving the diseased skin attached by two pedicles in the mid-line, anteriorly and posteriorly. The flaps of skin are dissected from subjacent tissues, and anteriorly and posteriorly where it remains attached it is undercut so that it is entirely severed from its deep connexions. Haemorrhage is arrested most carefully, as the occurrence of a hsematoma may endanger the vitality of the flaps, which are replaced and retained by sutures. Sensation returns, but not the pruritus. Occasionally a spot or two of skin does again suffer from pruritus, but this may be treated in a similar way.

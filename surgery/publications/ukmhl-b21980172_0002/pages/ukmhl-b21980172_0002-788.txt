730 THE LIVER diameter, is further narrowed by spiral folds—Heister's valves—so that,, unless dilated, it does not permit the passage of a probe. The cystic artery lies to the inner side of the duct, and is not in. direct contact with it. In the angle between the cystic and the hepatic ducts, one or more lymphatic glands are constantly present, and, whem enlarged, may closely simulate calculi. Fig. 519.—Diagram of the gall-bladder and bile-ducts. I'he black outlines represent the normal conditions ; red indicates a calculus impacted in the cystic duct, with consequent distension of the gall-bladder and no jaundice ; and _s:reen, a stone in the lower end of the common duct, with a contracted and thickened gall-bladder, and deep jaundice. The common hepatic duct is about \\ in. in length, while the common bile-duct is about 3 in. long and ,V in. in diameter, and may conveniently be divided into three portions. The ■first or supraduodenal ■portion extends to the upper border of the duodenum, in the free edge of the gastro-hepatic omentum. Behind it runs the portal vein, and to its inner side:^

322 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM wall or liver so that diverticula, are formed. Out of 45 cases oper- ated upon and reported by Mayo Robson and Moynihan, 37 were the result of ulcer or perigastritis. Hour-glass stomach is met with as a complication of gastric ulcer in from 3-3 per cent. (W. J. Mayo, in 925 operations) to 9 per cent. (Moynihan, in 198 operations) of the cases. I believe that Mayo's figures represent the truer proportion. Perigastric adhesions other than those due to ulcer may cause the condition. It may be the result of the healing of ulcers after Fig. 369.â€”Hour-glass stomach, due to cicatrization of a saddle- shaped lesser-curvature ulcer. {Loniion Hospital FatJiolo^ical InstitiiU.) corrosive poisoning; I have recently operated upon such a case. Cases have also been described as due to syphilis of the stomach. Undoubtedly, though extremely rarely, the condition may arise congenitally, for Delamere and Dieulafe, and Gardiner, have recorded cases, and according to Martin there is a specimen in the McGill Museum. As the stomach in the early stage of development consists ol a tubular pyloric portion and a cardiac pouch, a continuance of the foetal condition would account for these cases. (Kg. 362). The constriction is generally single and situated towards the pyloric end of the stomach, and, as a rule, the greater curvature is drawn up towards the lesser. The cardiac pouch is usually larger than the pyloric. When, however, as not infrequently happens, pyloric obstruction coexists, the pyloric pouch may be as large as the cardiac. The recognition of this fact is important, for the pyloric pouch may be mistaken at operation for the whole stomach, and a gastro-jejunostomy performed on it with a fatal result ; well-

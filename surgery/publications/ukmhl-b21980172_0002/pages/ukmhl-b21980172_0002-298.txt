264 THE (ESOPHAGUS Treatment of diverticula,—The treatment of oesophagea pouches consists in their removal by dissection, with closure of the neck by suture.-"- I -^SMBM; M. ^ prelimi- nary cleansing of the patient's mouth, the pouch is emptied, then exposed by an incision along the anterior margin of the sterno - mastoid muscle, and dissected out with the least possible disturbance of the surrounding tissues. It may be either cut away and its neck secured by tiers of sutures, or it may, if small, be invaginated into the CESophagus. The chief risk is subse- quent leakage and formation of a fis- tula. Free drainage should always be employed, and rectal feeding administered for the first three days after operation. The fistula, if it occurs, tends to close naturally in a few weeks. This opera- tion is not accom- panied by much shock, and it has been successfully performed in elderly patients. Operations of Surgery," Richaidson's -well-known SAS.

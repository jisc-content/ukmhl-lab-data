Lymphangioma of dorsum of the tongue, which was beset with clear vesicles, between which were scarlet capillary loops and blood-filled vesicles. A few of the vesicles were filled with opaque, white material. The condition was associated with a capillary naevus involving the lower lip and about half an inch of skin surface parallel to the muco-cutaneous margin, and extending across the alveolar margin to the under surface of the tongue, where there were some dilated veins.

ACUTE INTUSSUSCEPTION IN CHILDREN 487 or of ail inverted Meckel's diverticulum or vermiform, appendix, renders such air explanation of tlie commencement of the invagina- tion even more easily understood (Fig. 418). The apex of the in- tussusception, the first part to be invaginated, for all practical purposes remains constant, and, as it soon becomes congested and edematous, it is impossible for more of the entering layer to roll Fig. 417.â€”Illustrating the mechanism by which ileo-colic intussusceptions are formed.

The result is that the peristaltic efforts of the gut to force on the apex drag the sheath over the intussusceptum, so that the returning layer is gra- dually lengthened and the sheath creeps up the invaginated portion. An intussusception, therefore, increases at the expense of the sheath. The frecjuency with which the intussusception originates in the

DEVELOPMENT OF THE PREMAXILLA 125 necessarily associated with cleft palate, for, as Fig. 297 cleady shows, the upper lip is completed by the union of the maxillary and globular processes, whilst the palate is fashioned from the three horizontal plates which grow inwards from these processes. The foetal palate has a very high arch, for the palatal plates develop in an upward as well as a horizontal direction, in the endeavour, as it were, to meet the nasal septum, with which they eventually fuse. This peculiarity of growth accounts for the frequent combination of a high arch with cleft palate, and in such cases is of great value to the surgeon if a " flap-sliding " operation is undertaken, for, when the premaxilla Fig. 298.â€”Showing the hard palate at birth. The premaxillary part is formed from the mesial nasal processes , the re- mainder by the palatal plates of the maxillary processes. {From Kl'HIis Human Embryology and Morphology. '^) flaps are separated from the bone, they fall into a horizontal plane, and so naturally approach one another. Development of the premaxilla The premaxillary bones are ossified from two centres which appear side by side in the pre- maxillary process on the deep aspect of the mesial nasal process ; later, these bifurcate and give origin to the four incisor bones. (Fig. 298.) As a rule, all four upper incisor teeth are developed on this process, each bone forming the socket for one tooth ; but, according to Keith, the lateral incisor may occasionally appear on that part of the alveolus wliich is developed from the maxillary process. In the majority of mammals the premaxilla is highly developed and forms the prognathion or snout. This characteristic is well simulated in the infant in those cases in which a cleft in the hard palate bifurcates at the naso-palatine foramen into two branches, that pass forwards and outwards between the premaxillary and

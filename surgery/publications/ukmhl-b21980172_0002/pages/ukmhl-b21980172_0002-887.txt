MALIGNANT DISEASE 819 'There is no direct evidence that injury causes renal growths. Stone .may coexist, but is not an important factor in etiology. Pathology and histology. 1. Carcinoma.^—Of recent •years it has been shown that carcinoma is a rare growth of the kidney (7 per cent., Garceau). It originates in the renal tubules, and shows ,the following varieties of structure, viz. (a) diffuse infiltration, the cells in some parts being arranged in masses or alveoli—adeno-carcinoma (Fig. 542) ; (b) tubules lined with epithelium closely resembling the structure of normal kidney—adenoma-carcinoma ; (c) acini contain- ing papillary growths—papillary adeno-carcinoma. The tumours are usually small, and on section are grey, yellow, or brown in colour, with tracts of fibrous tissue. 2. Sarcoma is most common in children, and is more often bilateral than carcinoma. It may reach enormous proportions (33 lb.. Van der Byl). The growth may arise from the capsule, from the peri- vascular connective tissue, or in the substance of the kidney. On section the surface has a greyish, brain-like appearance, and an alveolar arrangement in parts, and there is an ill-defined capsule. These tumours are of the spindle- and small round-celled varieties.

A localized abscess or gangrene of the lung will probably require treatment, should the patient survive. Removal of the glands.—If the intrabuccal method of Fig. 341.—Incisions for Butlin's gland dissection. Whitehead is selected, whether the glands appear enlarged or not, a complete dissection should be made of the anterior triangle of the neck within ten days of the removal of the tongue. The indications for attacking both sides have been given already. Butlin's method (Fig. 341).—The best method for removing the glands in early cases is that described by Butlin.

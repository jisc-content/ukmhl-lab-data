544 THE APPENDIX discharged into the peritoneal cavity. This constitutes the first and chief line of resistance. The second protective process lies in the formation of adhesions, so that when the perforation does occur it is not into the general cavity but into a localized portion of it (Fig. 437). In this manner the effect of the bacterial invasion of the peritoneal cavity, whether with or without gross perforation of the appendix, is the pro- duction of a localized abscess. When these protec- tive agencies, either from want of time or from lack of resistance on the part of the indi- vidual, fail to limit the infection, a diffuse, spreading peritonitis re- sults.

ACUTE FORMS OF APPENDICITIS Clinical fea- tures.— The va- rious morbid con- ditions of the appendix indicated above bear but little relation to the clinical course of the disease. A rapidly fatal diffuse peritonitis may spread from an appendix which to the naked eye appears only reddened and swollen, but unper- forated, or a gangrenous perforated appendix may be found in a completely localized abscess cavity. Nor is there any means of re- cognizing clinically the presence of constrictions, adhesions, or con- cretions, with the possible exception of the latter, which have some- times been demonstrated by means of the X-rays. It is not possible, therefore, to make clinical subdivisions to correspond with the various pathological conditions enumerated above. Appendicitis presents itself in many different degrees of severity, all of which pass by gentle gradations into one another. Neverthe- less, certain common types of the acute disease may be recognized, so

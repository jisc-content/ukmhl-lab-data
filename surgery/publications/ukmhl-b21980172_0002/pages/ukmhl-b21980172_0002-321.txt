CESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMA 285 Metastatic growths from oesophageal carcinoma have been recorded, but are of rare occurrence. Glandular deposits are frequently noted. Tlie lower deep cer- vical glands on either side are affected when the prim- ary growth is situated in the upper part of the oesophagus. Growths in the thoracic por- tion lead to involvement of the mediastinal glands. As the growth extends outwards into the muscular wall it may finally penetrate to those structures in close relation to the oesophagus. Peri - oesophageal adhesions and infiltration lead to im- plication of nerves, viz. the vagi, recurrent laryngeal, and sympathetic. Perforation of the large vessels in the thorax, or of those portions of the air-passages in close relation to the oesophagus, have been noted in many cases {see Fig. 359). Less commonly the pleura and lungs are involved. Perforation of the lung leads to gangrene and cavity formation, with possible se- condary erosion of branches of the pulmonary artery. Ill 7n cases of perforation into the air-passages collected by Zenker and von Ziemssen (Kraus), 26 involved the riglit or left bronchus, 21 the trachea. In 2.3 cases the lungs were in- vaded ; tlie right lung was three times more commonly affected than the left. The pleural cavity is sel- dom penetrated.

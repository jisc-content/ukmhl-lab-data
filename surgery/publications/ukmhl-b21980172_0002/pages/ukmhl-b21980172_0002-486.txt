Varieties.—As the process of obliteration may be arrested at any stage, this deformity manifests itself in many varieties. It has been estimated that a Meckel's diverticulum is present in 2 per cent, of human subjects, but in the vast majority of cases it is simply repre- sented by a small thimble-like pouch wliich causes no trouble and gives rise to no inconvenience.

It may persist as a patent canal, opening at the umbilicus at one end and into the ileum at the other, constituting one form of umbilical fistula. The mucous membrane is sometimes prolapsed, forming a reddish, conical projection at the umbilicus (Fig. 398), from which exudes a quantity of clear mucus, occasionally mixed with faecal matter. Sometimes it forms a sinus, opening at the umbilicus but ending bhndly a short distance inside the abdominal cavity. The most common form is a short tubular or saccular pouch of variable length (Fig. 399), with a well-formed mesentery, which passes in fi'ont of the ileum and has an artery running in its free border ; or the mesentery may be merely represented by a fibrous cord passing from the mesen- tery of the ileum to the tip of the diverticulum. In other cases it is narrowed down to a long, vermiform, or even filiform, process, which sometimes ends in a bulbous enlargement (Fig. 397 )>

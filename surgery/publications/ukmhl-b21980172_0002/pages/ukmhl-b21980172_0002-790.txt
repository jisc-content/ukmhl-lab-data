732 THE LIVER serious feature is liEemorrhage, either into the peritoneal cavity or into the liver or ducts. Injuries to the diaphragm, lung, stomach or bowel, Iddney or spleen are often serious complications. Clinical features.—With the slighter injuries there may be only mild shock with rigidity and tenderness over the liver and limita tion of respiratory movement. Later, there may be some jaundice and glycosuria ; and later still, perhaps, evidence of infection. As a rule, there is severe pain with great tenderness over the liver, and extreme general rigidity, the chest being held almost still. Marked pallor suggests grave internal haemorrhage, and it may be possible to detect free fluid in the abdominal cavity. In cases that survive, Fig. 520.—Old subcapsular laceration of the liver. distension soon ensues, and jaundice commonly occurs some days after the injury. Diagnosis.—The cases may be arranged in three groups : (a) Those with signs of overwhelming internal haemorrhage, but with nothing to indicate its source ; (6) those with evidence of severe haemorrhage, with injury to the parietes, fracture of ribs, or localized pain and tenderness over the liver region ; (c) those in which the site of the injury suggests a possible rupture of the liver, but in which there are no signs of haemorrhage, but only localized tenderness and rigidity, with subsequent enlargement of the liver and some slight jaundice. Prognosis.—Injuries sufficiently serious to demand surgical interference are attended with a mortality of 60 or 70 per cent. The lesser degrees of contusion or laceration may recover spontaneously, but the possibility of late death from secondary haemorrhage, infection, or pulmonary embolism must be remembered. Treatment.—In open wounds it is always wise to operate.

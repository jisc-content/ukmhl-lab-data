CLEFT PALATE 145 lower margin of the nasal septum, and the lateral elements by the alveolar margin, the hard palate, and the soft palate. Tripartite palate is generally complicated by complete bilateral hare-lip and excessive protrusion of the premaxilla. 2. Bifcirtite jjalate.—In this variety, owing to the union of the premaxilla with the maxilla on one side, the cleft is single and hes between the premaxilla and the opposite maxilla, extending from the alveolus to the naso-palatine foramen, and posterior to this (in 1 I 1 Fig. 316.—Tripartite palate. Fig. 317. ^Intermaxillary cleft. the middle line) between the two halves of the hard and soft palates (Fig. 318). Theoretically, the cleft should bend outwards in its course between the naso-palatine foramen and the alveolar margin, but as a matter of fact the divergence frcm the mid-Une is very slight, as the premaxillary portion of the alveolar arch is always rotated forwards, upwards, and away from the cleft. The maxillary element with which the premaxilla fails to unite is usually the left one ; but why this should be, no satisfactory explanation is forthcoming. The nasal septum, instead of being free, as in the tripartite palate, is generally adherent for a part or the whole of its length to the right

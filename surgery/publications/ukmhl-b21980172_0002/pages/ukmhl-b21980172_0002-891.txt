TUMOURS OF RENAL PELVIS 823 From 7 to 10 per cent, of cases survive at tlie end of the fourth year without recurrence. In children the operative mortality is higher (25 to 30 per cent.), and recurrence is more rapid and certain (67 to 81 per cent, of survivals). Cases are recorded in which the patients were alive and well eighteen years (Malcolm), five years (Israel), and four years (Doderlein, Abbe) after operation. TUMOUES OF THE RENAL PELVIS AND URETER Primary growths of the renal pelvis are very rare. Calculi have been present in the pelvis in some cases. Pathology.— Epitlielial tumours (papilloma and epi- thelioma) are most frequent, while meso- blastic tumours (sarcoma, myxoma, rhabdo - myoma, and lipoma) are rare. Papilloma is tlie commonest form, and is situated at the uretero - pelvic juiii - tion or in the ureter, and may protrude into the bladder. The tumour closely resem- bles vesical papilloma and tends to become malignant. (Fig. 544.) The growths spread into the kidney and along the ureter. Columnar-celled carcinoma is less frequent, and forms a nodular growth which rapidly spreads to neighbouring struc- tures and forms metastases. Obstruction at the outlet of the pelvis may cause hydronephrosis, which may become hfcmatonephrosis or pyonephrosis. Symptoms.—The symptoms are hsematuria, pain, and tumour. Attacks of renal retention occur, accompanied by intense renal and Ureteral pain and rapid enlargement of tlie kidney. On cystoscopy a tumour may be seen projecting from the ureter, and the ureteral catheter may draw blood and urine from the renal pelvis. Treatment.—Nephrectomy, combined if necessary with meter- Fig. .544.—Malignant growth of kidney and papillomatous growth of renal pelvis.

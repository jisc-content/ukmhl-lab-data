763 ANATOMY AND ABNORMALITIES THE PANCREAS Anatomy.—The pancreas lies in the epigastric and left hypo- chondriac regions, crossing the posterior abdominal wall at the level of the first lumbar vertebra, its head nestling in the duodenal hollow opposite the 2nd and 3rd lumbar vertebra, and its tail abutting on the spleen (Fig. 535). The greater part lies behind the stomach, the lesser sac forming its most important anterior relation. The main Fig. 535.—Diagram showing the relations of the pancreas. (From " Smxeiy.

Mayo.) duct (Wirsung's) opens into the second part of the duodenum, 3 or 4 in. from the pylorus, either directly or through the ampulla of Vater. The pancreas is a compound tubular gland, resembling the parotid, but more loosely arranged and possessing interacinous islands of small polygonal cells known as the islands of Langerhans. Abnormalities.—The head of the pancreas may completely surround the duodenum. An accessory pancreas, varying in size from a hempseed to a bean, may lie in the wall of the stomach, duo- denum, jejunum, or ileum, and has been found at the apex of a gastric or intestinal diverticulum. Rarely the pancreas is abnormally movable, and has been found in both diaphragmatic and umbilical hernias.

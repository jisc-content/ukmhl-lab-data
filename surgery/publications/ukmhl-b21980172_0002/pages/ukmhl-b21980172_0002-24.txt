THE BREAST 4 the boundary zones of the catchment areas no trunk lymphatics are present. Here are found only narrow, tortuous channels, not navigable by floating cancer cells, and only to be penetrated by the slower process of permeation. One lymphatic trunk deserves especial mention. It arises on the posterior aspect of the breast and pierces the great pectoral muscle to terminate in the subclavian lymphatic glands, without passing first into the lower lymphatic glands of the axilla. Con- sequently, in breast cancer the sub- clavian glands may be found enlarged before the lower axillary glands have become affected. The subclavian glands themselves are of great sur- gical importance. They are situated just below the clavicle, internally to the first part of the axillary ar- tery and vein, and shielded in front by the great pec- toral muscle and by the costo-cora- coid membrane. Owing to their sheltered position they are very likely to escape removal at the hands of an inexpert operator for breast cancer. Their efferent vessels form the afferents of the supraclavicular glands, which are the next set to be involved in breast cancer. It has been sometimes stated that efferent lymphatic vessels from the breast pass to the retrosternal chain of glands which accompanies the internal mammary artery. It is doubtless true that there is a mediate communication between the breast and these glands by way of the pectoral lymphatic plexus and of the perforating branches which run from that plexus to the glands in question. But, fortunately, Fig. 251.â€”The trunks of the fascial plexus. The fine meshwork of vessels constituting the plexus itself is only partially indicated in this figure.

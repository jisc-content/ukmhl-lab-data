DIVERTICULA OF COLON 441 Similar pressure diverticula are by no means uncommon in the colon, particularly in the pelvic colon and lower part of the descend- ing colon. They are not confined to the line of the mesenteric attach- ment, but may form anywhere between the longitudinal muscular bands, and they sometimes pass into an appendix epiploica. Usually multiple, they vary in size from a tiny saccule just admitting a probe, to an elongated pouch resembling at first sight a Meckel's diverticulum. Muscular tissue has been found in the Fig. 397.—Meckel's diverticulum attached to abdominal wall. [Autlior s Cdsc.) wall of the pouch in some cases. They often contain concretions composed of inspissated fsecal matter, cholesterin, or calcium carbonate. The presence of such foreign bodies causes irritation of the mucous membrane—diverticulitis (p. 510)—and this may result in abscess formation and perforation, or may set up chronic pericolitis with the formation of an inflammatory cicatricial mass which may simulate maUgnant disease (p. 515). In some cases, the formation of an abscess has resulted in the production of fistulous communications with the bladder. Meckel's Diverticulum Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital abnormality of the small intestine due to persistence of the intra-abdominal part of the vitelline duct, which, under normal conditions, sliould be obliterated during

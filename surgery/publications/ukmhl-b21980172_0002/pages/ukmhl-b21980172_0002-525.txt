STRANGULATION BY BANDS 481 or in relation with localized foci of tuberculosis either in the bowel or the mesenteric glands. Not infrequently a band foims at the site of a previous operation. As a rule, one end of the band is attached to the mesentery and the other to the parietal peritoneum, to another part of the mesent- ery, or to one of the viscera (Fig 411). Occasionally, one extremity becomes separated, and floats free among the viscera. Bands vary in length from a frac- tion of an inch to several inches, and in thickness from a mere thread to a cord as thick as the finger. As a rule, they are round and cord-like, but some- times they are flat- tened like a ribbon. 2. Omental hatuls. —The free edge of the great omentum not infrequently forms attachments with some part that has been the seat of inflammation, such as the region of the veimiform appendix, the Fallopian tube, tuberculous mesen- teric glands, or a loop of intestine which has been injured or is the seat of ulceration ; ancl in course of time the adherent portion becomes so stretched and moulded as to constitute a band. Bands formed in this way are usually broader and stronger than peritoneal bands, and the fact that one end is always attached to the transverse colon, which is movable and yielding, explains why strangulation by an omental band is generally less acute than that caused by a fibrous cord. There is often more than one omental band—a fact which must be borne in mind in eases of obstruction, lest the whole of the con- stricting agent be not divided.

PERIGASTRIC ABSCESS 373 the floor of the ulcer carefully examined, and any vessels which have ruptured tied on both sides. In one case I was able successfully to ligate on both sides of an opening in a large artery in the floor of an ulcer on the posterior wall. If the condition of the patient permits, gastro-jejunostomy should be done at the same time. If the ulcer is duodenal, it should be infolded, and the gastro-duo- denal artery tied ; if on account of adhesions or vdceration the anterior wall cannot be satisfactorily infolded so as to press upon the affected vessel (usually the gastro-duodenal), the gut should be opened and the vessel ligated. Posterior gastro-jejunostomy should then be done. If the stomach appears to be normal, no operation should be performed, but the abdomen closed. PERIGASTRIC ABSCESS This is usually due to the perforation of a chronic gastric ulcer, or to imperfect dramage of the abdominal cavity after operation for perforation. When a perigastric abscess is the result of an ulcer on the anterior wall of the stomach, this viscus forms the lower boundary of the Fig. 381.â€”Diagrams to illustrate abscess in left anterior intraperitoneal fossa. (Bur/iurd.) abscess cavity, the gastro-hepatic omentum the posterior wall, and the liver the upper wall. Such an abscess may burst through the skin, or may open into the colon, causing a gastro-colic fistula, or may become subphrenic. As a rule, ulcers wliich perforate chronically are situated on the posterior surface of the stomach, and a subplirenic abscess results (p. 572).

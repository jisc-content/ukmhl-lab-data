234 THE SALIVARY GLAND^ AND FLOOR OF THE MOUTH By IVOR BACK, M.A., M.B., B.G.Gantab., F.R.C.S.Eng. INJURIES OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS THE PAROTID GLAND Any of the salivary glands may be involved in an injury, but it is the parotid which is most frequently damaged in this way, on account of its comparatively exposed situation. The injury may be inflicted wilfully, as by stabbing or gunshot wounds, or accidentally, as during the course of a surgical operation. Armstrong of Montreal has recorded a case in which he accidentally injured the submaxillary gland while attempting to enucleate an overlying tuberculous gland. A fistula resulted which only closed after two further operations, in which the fistulous track was excised and the edges were approximated by deep sutures. Injuries involving the submaxillary or sublingual gland are of far less serious import than those in which the parotid is concerned, because if a permanent fistula results the gland can be excised completely with comparative ease and slight resulting disfigurement. But the parotid gland is so intimatel)^ connected with important structures that such a proceeding is rarely justifiable in its case unless the surgeon is dealing with a malignant new growth whose presence will inevitably cause the death of the patient. Injuries to the parotid may be subdivided according to whether the gland substance itself is injured, or its duct only. Injuries op the Parotid Gland Substance The tissue of the parotid gland is frequently incised during the course of surgical operations in the neck, but primary imion nearly always follows if the wound is closed with deep stitches, and a salivary fistula from this cause is uncommon. Treatment.â€”In dealing with an external wound of the parotid gland substance, the first duty of the surgeon is to exclude the presence

TRAUMATIC INTERSTITIAL HERNIA 6ii Umbilical hernia is so constantly associated with diverticulatiou of the sac that it cannot be considered as an irregular hernia, nor as interstitial, although the diverticula are at times found both between the peritoneum and the posterior sheath of the rectus muscle, and between the anterior slieatli and the superficial fascia. Traumatic interstitial hernia.—This is the result of ruptures or pathological lesions of the abdominal wall in which only the deeper layers have been affected; it is conse- quently a very rare con- dition. It has been seen following rupture of a section of the rectus muscle. Such a case oc- curred in my own prac- tice ; the bowel was found between the muscle and its anterior sheath, the rupture having taken place between the two lower linese transversse on the left side. Deep- seated gummata or chronic abscesses which have resolved under treatment may result in tlie formation of such a hernia. However they are produced, they can remain interstitial only for a time ; in course of years the coverings be- come tliinned out, fused together, and amalgam- Fig. 455.—Interstitial hernia and retained testis. {Author s case.) ated with the sac, and their interstitial character is thus to a great extent lost. The diagnosis is not usually difficult; an elastic, hyper-resonant swelHng, exhibiting intestinal gurgling, in the substance of the ab- dominal wall can hardly be mistaken for anything else than hernia. If the sac contains only omentum the case is not so obvious, for, impulse being probably absent owing to adhesions, the lobulation and doughiness of the mass might suggest a lipoma or other form of tumour.

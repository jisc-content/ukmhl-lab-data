720 RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL In the absence of these complications, factors which aid in the fatal termination are exhaustion from repeated hsemorrhages, pain, especially when the large nerve trunks are involved, sleeplessness from the incessant diarrhoea and pain, and absorption of toxins. Diagnosis.—It should be a cardinal rule thoroughly to examine every case presenting the slightest symptom of rectal trouble. If this rule were followed, and patients encouraged to present themselves on the first evidence of rectal disease, cancer would generally be re- cognized without difficulty at an early stage. The irregularly hard growth projecting into the lumen of the bowel is quite characteristic. Investigation under an- sesthesia and with the sigmoidoscope may be necessary. Although in most cases the cancer is typical to sight and touch, it may some- times be confused with other diseases. Chronic septic and tuberculous ulcerations, especially when associated with polypoidal masses of swollen and cedematous mucosa, are apt to be mistaken for carcinoma. The history, the flat and comparatively su- perficial ulcer, and the absence of induration will generally serve to differentiate these con- ditions. If any doubt remains, a portion of the swelling must be submitted to microscopy without delay. At times diagnosis between a benign and a malignant neoplasm of the rectum may be difficult (p. 712). The rare sarcoma may usually be distinguished by noting that it is a submucous rather than a surface growth. Treatment of removable cancer.—A growth may be considered removable when confined to the rectum (to determine this, examination under anaesthesia may be necessary), when invaded glands are operable and visceral deposits are absent. Exceptions naturally occur. For instance, slight invasion of the prostate has been successfully dealt with by ablating a portion of the gland ; similarly, Fig. 516.—Section of rectal cancer, showing infiltration of the muscular wall.

CYSTITIS 863 Contrexeville, or Vittel, is frequently of great service. Vaccine treat- ment is occasionally beneficial (see below), while drainage of the bladder with daily flushing or continuous irrigation may become necessary. In acid cystitis a preliminary washing with a weak alkali such as bicarbonate of soda (1 or 2 per cent.) is useful, while in very alkaline cystitis a weak solution of acetic acid (| per cent.) may be employed. The following solutions are useful, viz. : potassium permanganate, 1 in .5,000 or 10,000 ; oxycyanide of mercury, 1 in 1,000 or 5,000 ; biniodide of mercury, 1 in 10,000 or 20,000 ; tincture of iodine, i to 1 drachm to the pint ; nitrate of silver, 1 in 2,000 or 10,000. The instillation of small quantities (^2 drachms) of more powerful solutions is sometimes useful. These are introduced by means of a small syringe and catheter. Iodoform in sterilized liquid paraffin (5 per cent.), gomenol (5 to 20 per cent.), silver nitrate (2 per cent.), and protargol (2 per cent.) may be used. In intractable siibacute and chronic cystitis the bladder may be drained by catheter in the urethra, or by the perineal or suprapubic routes. Serum and vaccine treatment.'—In acute cystitis, especi- ally if due to the Bacillus coli or the streptococcus, serum-therapy may be useful. The serum is injected subcutaneously, and a large initial dose is given (20 c.c), followed by smaller doses (10 c.c). Calcium lactate should be given at the same time to prevent serum rashes and joint troubles. Vaccine treatment is most suitable for cases of subacute and chronic cystitis. The patient is inoculated with an autogenous vaccine, commencing with small doses at intervals of three or four days, rising slowly to higher doses, and extending the interval to a week or longer. A reaction should be avoided. The vaccine of Bacillus coli is that most frequently used, the dosage commencing with 3 millions or less of dead bacteria, and rising to 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, and so on to 100 and eventually to 200 millions. The staphylococcus is given in doses commencing at 100 millions, and rising to 500 or 1,000 millions ; and the streptococcus commences at 2, 3, 5, and 10 millions, and rises gradually to 50 and 100 millions. The treatment may extend over several months. TUBERCULOUS CYSTITIS Tuberculous cystitis may be "primary"' in the bladder, or secondary to a tuben ulous focus in the kidney or the male genital system. Etiology.—Vesical tuberculosis occurs in youth and early adult life, very rarely in old age, and is more common in men than in 1 Sec also Vol. I., pp. 90-108.

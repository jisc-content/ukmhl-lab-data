196 THE TONGUE tumours containing glairy fluid, and in most cases some connexion with the pharyngeal wall can be discovered. Strictly speaking, such dermoids as these do not occur primarily in the tongue, being generally found in the submaxillary region, from which, by extension, they may invade the lingual substance. The third variety is the one which develops in connexion with the median thyroid rudiment (Fig. 337) ; such cysts or, it may be, solid tumours occur .r^^y \ deeply in the pos- terior part of the tongue ; this form is called by Bland- Sutton a " tubulo- dermoid.'" Sequestration Dermoids These cysts usually occur in the anterior part of the tongue, in the middle line, and are then situated between the two genio - hyo - glossi; sometimes they are laterally placed, but this is owing to their irregular extension, or more probably to the cysts having arisen in a branchial re- cess. Such cysts grow slowly and protrude either into the mouth or into the submental region ; in advanced cases a very large swelling may be formed which renders closure of the mouth impossible. The swelling has a curious doughy feel, pits on pressure, and in some cases is of a yellowish colour. If the cyst has been allowed to rupture, or has been incompletely removed, dermoid -jistula} form, and discharge the sebaceous debris and hairs found in these cavities ; the cavity usually becomes infected, and the contents may be horridly fetid.

THE OVARY 1070 are always sessile. The ovary is at first quite separate from tte cyst, but when the latter attains a large size this organ may become incorporated with its posterior wall. Br 0 ad-ligament cysts are usually uni- locular, and contain a thin straw-coloured fluid. As regards their origin, they may be divided into two classes — (a) parova- rian (epoophoronic), and (&) inflamma- tory. (a) Parovarian cysts.—Distension of the vestigial ducts of the parovarium pro- duces cysts originat- ing in the mesosal- pinx. When developed from one of the outer group {Kobelt's tubes) the cyst is stalked and small. Cysts of the outer segment of Gartner's duct have a peduncle formed of the tube and the inner portion of the mesosalpinx, but those arising nearer the uterus have no pedi- cle and burrow down- wards into the lower part of the broad li- gament. Parovarian cysts have a lining of short cubical epithe- lium like that of the tubules from which they spring (Fig. 622). Cilia have been de- scribed, but these, if found, probably indi- cate a Miillerian origin. Parovarian cysts contain a thin serous fluid. They are commonest between 30 and 40 years of age. 617.—Unilocular teratomatous cyst (dermoid cyst). Fig. 618.—Dermoid cyst, opened to show the [foetal rudiment with two well-formed teeth.

1073 OVARIAN CYSTS Fig. 623.—Benign papilliferous cyst. berant masses growing in tufts which after a time burrow through the cyst wall and sprout on its outer surface. When large they entirely fill the cyst cavity and eventu- ally cause rupture. They then become rapidly diffused and grafted over the whole of the surface of the peritoneum, which may be studded with thou- sands of little secondary growths. This change is as- sociated with rapid effusion of peri- toneal fluid. In microscopi- cal structure they vary. The more innocent present a single layer of The papillomas arc covered with a single layer of epilhelium. columnar epithe- - , lium (Fig. 623), but in others these cells are massively arranged in many layers (Fig. 624). These latter are frankly malignant, and rapidly recur after removal, but secondary nodules of the single- layered type may spontaneously dis- appear after the removal of the primary growth. Many other forms of malignant degeneration may occur in ovarian 3q I,ar Fig. 624.—Malignant papilliferous cyst. masses of epithelium cover the papillomatous out- growths and infiltrate the cyst wall.

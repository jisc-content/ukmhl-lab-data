1079 OVARIAN CARCINOMA difficult, but the occurreuce of ascites with simple fibromas must be remembered. The histological nature of the growth can only be determined after removal. The uterus and both appendages must be totally extirpated. CARCINOMA Primary growths exhibit various characters in different cases, the tubular columnar-celled type being that most frequently met with. Secondary carcinoma is much more commion, and is especially associated with carcinoma of the stomach or some part of the intestines. Fig. 625.â€”Uterus with bilateral malignant ovarian tumours. In terminal carcinoma of the breast, surface metastases on the ovary are often found, as shown by Handley. Secondary carcinomatous tumours are nearly always bilateral, and are usually partly cystic from the inclusion of dropsical follicles in the growth (Fig. 625). Primary carcinoma exhibits the same general symptoms and signs as primary sarcoma (see p. 1078). Secondary carcinomatous tumours attain a large size, and, as pointed out by Bland-Sutton, their metas- tatic origin may be overlooked. Immediate removal, together with the uterus and the rest of the appendages, is the only course. If the condition is bilateral, a very careful search should be made for a primary growth in the abdomen elsewhere.

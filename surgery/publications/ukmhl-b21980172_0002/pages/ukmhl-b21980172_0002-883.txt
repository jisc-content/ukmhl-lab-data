HYDRONEPHROSIS: PATHOLOGY 815 "When a tense hydronephrosis is found soon after an injury it has usually preceded the injury. Late traumatic hydronephrosis results from stricture caused by injury to the ureter. In hydronephrosis due to calculus the stone may lie at the outlet of the pelvis or at the lower end of the ureter. Stenosis of the ureter on the vesical side of the stone is frequently present. A hydronephrosis is " closed " when the obstruction has become complete, and " open " when urine escapes. In an open hydronephrosis Fig. 540.—Hydronephrosis due to aberrant renal vessels (operation view): aneurysm needle under normal ureter. there are attacks of retention due to temporary complete closure of the outlet. Pathological anatomy.—In tlie early stage the normal capa- city of the renal pelvis (30-(iO minims) is increased to 1 oz. or more. The pelvis is sac-like and the kidney hollowed, but the organ is not enlarged. The calyces become dilated, and the pyramids flattened and then hollowed. In the fully developed hydronephrosis the sac is formed from either the pelvis or the kidney. When the pelvis is chiefly affected it forms a large globular sac on which the hollow kidney is set as a cap. When the kidney a^one is distended the surface shows

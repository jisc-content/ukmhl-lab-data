HERNIAL SAGS 583 abdominal ring, by a septum whicli, having been stretched and forced downwards, has formed a second sac dependent withiyi the lumen of the first (Fig. 445). A better term for the first of these sacs would be " retrofunicular," and for the second " intrafvmicular." It is doubtful if the second sac in the first of these forms is really of congenital origin. The congenital sac differs but slightly from the acquired sac in its general appearance ; it is, however, usually narrower at the Fig. 444.—Sac of infantile Fig. 445.—Sac of encysted hernia; common variety. infantile hernia, r.v., Processus vaginalis ; h.s., hernial r.v,, Processus vaginalis ; h.s., hernial sac; 0.1'., pubes ; r., rectus muscle. sac; o.p.,lpubes ; R., rectus muscle. neck, less adherent to its surroundings, and freer from thickening and cicatrization of its walls ; it is frequently empty or contains only fluid. Contents of hernial sacs.—In a reducible hernia the con- tents may var}-, but in an irreducible one they are usually constant. The commonest content is the omentum, owing to its weight, length, mobility, and lobulated character, which facilitate its engagement in the hernial orifices. Occasionally its free margin becomes adherent to the posterior edge of the aperture, and a part above is invaginated into the sac so as to form an omental lining or " omental sac " ; the recognition of this condition is important during operation, owing

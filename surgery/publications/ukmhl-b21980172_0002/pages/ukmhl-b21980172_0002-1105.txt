1027 CORPOREAL CARCINOMA to live if the disease be left to run its course, the gain of even a year of health and hope is a great boon. Treatment of inoperable cases.—Where the growth is irremov- able, considerable benefit sometimes follows a thorough scraping and cauterization, or the application of pure acetone by a tubular speculum especially in foul, fungating cases. Frequent douching with crude sanitas (1 oz. to a pint) restrains the fetor. To allay pain, aspirin in 10-gr. doses should at first be tried ; later, phenacetin is useful. Morpliia should be reserved until the latest possible period. CARCINOMA OF THE BODY OF THE UTERUS Etiology Tliis disease is rare in women under 45. Its maximum inci- dence occurs be- tween the years from 50 to 60—i.e. during or soon after the menopause— after which it is met with in les- sening frequency. It is much less common than car- cinoma of the cer- vix, and contrasts markedly with it in that it has no relation to marriage and childbearing. Pathology.-—There are two macroscopic forms^—the fungating and the ulcerative. In the first, the organ is enlarged and its cavity is filled by a soft pulpy growth sprouting from the wall (Fig. 593); in the second, the uterus may be quite small, though its interior is excavated by a diffuse ulceration, the surface of which is irregular and friable. Microscopically the neoplasm is most often a columnar- celled adeno-carcinoma (Fig. 594), but in senile patients, in whom the corporeal epithelium has undergone degenerative flattening, a keratinizing squamous - celled growth may occur. Lymphatic per- meation follows the course of the ovarian vessels, and primarily reaches the lumbar and aortic glands. Fig. 594.—Columnar-celled tubular carcinoma the body of the uterus.

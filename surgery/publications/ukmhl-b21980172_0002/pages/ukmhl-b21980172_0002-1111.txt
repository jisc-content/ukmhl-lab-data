1033 MYOMA : DEGENERATIONS Pathology.—A uterine myoma in its earliest stage presents as a little white nodule embedded in the musculature. Structurally, it consists of densely interlaced unstriped muscle fibres united by some connective tissue. (Fig. 602.) It contains but a few small vessels, derived from the adjacent uterine wall, which surrounds the tumour in concentric layers and forms its capsule. As the tumour enlarges, the uterine wall around it hypertrophies, and assumes the stratified appearance which characterizes the muscu- lature of the pregnant uterus. The micro- scopical structure of a " normal " myoma is identi- cal with that of the muscular uterine wall itself, except that it does not contain considerable ves- sels. Such a tu- mour takes years to attain large size. Owing prob- ably to their poor vascular supply, myomas are par- ticularly prone to degenerate; to this more than to any other factor the serious symp- toms are due. These degenerations must be considered in detail, as follows :— Fibrotic degeneration.—Characterized by increase in the white fibrous elements of the tumour and disappearance of the muscle tissue. The tumour becomes very white and hard, and ceases to grow {fibro-myoma). Calcareous degeneration.—Usually a senile change. The calcific deposit may begin centrally or peripherally. The tumour becomes stony hard and, of course, ceases to grow. The change is most apt to affect pedunculated subperitoneal tumours in old age, and is not entirely beneficent, for the rough surface may set up chronic peritonitis around it.

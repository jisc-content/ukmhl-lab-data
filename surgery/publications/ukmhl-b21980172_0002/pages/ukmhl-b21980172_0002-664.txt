6o8 HERNIA (3) The possibility of the existence of these rare hernias should never be forgotten in obscure cases of intestinal obstruction. (4) Strangulation is usually tight and the mortality high, therefore no time should be lost in clearing up the diagnosis. These hernias may contain any of the organs commonly foimd in inguinal or femoral sacs, and are less frequently seen in children than in adults ; and the sexes appear to be equally affected. 4. Perineal her- nia.—This is rare. Pro- trusions are seen (a) to one side or other of the perineum in the male, or in either labium in the female ; (b) in the ischio-rectal fossae, or (c) through the lateral va- ginal wall. Passing between the fibres of the levator ani muscle, these hernias in- variably carry before them a covering of the peritoneum and the pelvic fascia. They are of commoner occurrence in the female—owing / probably to the greater , I width of the pelvis, the i ■ presence of the vagina, _. „ , . , ^, ... and the great strain im- Fig. 453.—Subperitoneal fibroma simulating , ,i , • perineal hernia.

Lacerated wounds may originate them, and of these I have met with two cases, one following a deep wound from a broken chamber utensil, and the other a fall on a wooden paling. The diagnosis is not always easy, since these hernias are fre- quently closely simulated by pedunculated subperitoneal fibromas (Figs. 453 and 454). Such tumours are commonly, as in my case, easily reducible, soft, elastic, associated with a definite ring to be felt in the pelvic floor, and give a marked impulse on coughing. These fibromas

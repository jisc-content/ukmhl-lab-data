668 RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL One specimen in the Royal College of Surgeons Museum is unique (Keith) in that the rectum has two openings—(a) the proctodseum has grown in and opened into the rectum, forming an anus in the usual position, and (b) the cloacal orifice has been prolonged for- wards, and opens into the median raphe of the scrotum near the root of the penis. ii. Females.—The commonest abnormality is where the rectum opens into the navicular fossa of the vulval cleft (Fig. 484), that is, in a position corresponding to the abnormal opening in the male subject. Some reports state that a sphincter exists at the opening. The rectum has been seen opening into the vagina. Such cases, according to Keith's observations, are associated with a divided vagina, the arrested rectum probably preventing the fusion of the Miillerian ducts to form the vagina. In a few cases the vulva and clitoris are Fig. 485. — Rectum ending Fig. 486.—Rectum ending blindly blindly at the back of the at the upper level of the pos- prostate gland. terior fornix of the vagina. prolonged to form a urethra, and the rectum has been seen opening in the floor of this urethra immediately below the orifice. 2. Non-Development or Imperfect Development of the POSTALLANTOIC GuT i. The postallantoic gut may be practically non-existent, the rectum ending blindly at the base of the prostate (Fig. 485) or at the upper level of the vagina (Fig. 486). A fibrous cord may attach the termination of the rectum to these viscera (Figs. 487 and 488). ii. The postallantoic gut may grow backwards imperfectly, becom- ing separated from the prostate or the vagina (Fig. 489). It may end as a fibrous cord attached either to the proctodseal invagination (Fig. 490), or, if this be not developed, to the site of the normal anus.

THE SALIVARY GLANDS 238 fistula then closes of its own accord. But, to make assurance doubly sure, the edges of the fistula may be pared and united with one or two fishing-gut sutures. Tliis method has obvious limitations. It cannot, for instance, be used in a masseteric fistula, since it would be necessary to include the muscle in the ligature, and this is not feasible. Kaufmann has devised a modification of this method. The cheek is perforated opposite the fistula, and a small rubber tube 3 mm. Fig. 342.â€”Operation for fistula of salivary duct. thick is drawn through so that it projects both internally and ex- ternally. At the end of a week it is cut down on both sides so that it is flush with skin and mucous membrane. In another week it is removed entirely. He claims that the saliva will now flow into the mouth through the artificial orifice, and that the external fistula will close, especially if it is cauterized from time to time, or its edges are approximated by suture. The technique is extremely simple. One practical point must be observed: the tube must fit tightly in the perforation in the mucous membrane, or it will not remain in position. This method has one advantage over Deguise's. By maldng the track of the tube oblique, so that it enters the mouth in front of the masseter, it is applicable to masseteric fistulse, whereas Deguise's method can only be applied to the buccal variety with any prospect of success.

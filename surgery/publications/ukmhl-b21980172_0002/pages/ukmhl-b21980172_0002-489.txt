MECKEL'S DIVERTICULUM 445 attachments, lias made a ring through which a loop of bowel slips (Fig. 401). When the apes remains free, and especially if it is long and ends in a rounded laiob, a loop of bowel may be snared or noosed by it, and the knots thus formed may be most complicated. The condition is most usually met with in young adult males, with no history of previous injury or peritonitis such as woidd give rise to the formation of a fibrous band.

Gangrene of the diverticulum soon supervenes, or perforation occurs, and peritonitis sets in early. There are no symptoms by which strangulation of the bowel by a Meckel's diverticulum can be distinguished from obstruction due to other forms of band. 6. A Meckel's diverticulum, either alone or together with the portion of ileum from which it springs, may form one of the contents of an inguinal hernia, less frequently of a femoral hernia (Littre's

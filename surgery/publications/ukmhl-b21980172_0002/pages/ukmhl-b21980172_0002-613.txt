'PERITONEAL WATERSHEDS" 559 these projections, wliicli play so important a part in directing the course of fluid effusions, C. R. Box has given the name of abdominal watersheds (Figs. 439 and 440). ( I There are thus three large wells into which fluids tend to gravi- tate, namely, the pelvic cavity and the right and left lumbar regions. But the course which effused fluid takes is further influenced by the arrangement of certain peritoneal folds and of the fixed portions of Figs. 439 and 440.â€”Diagrams to show the " peritoneal watersheds." (C. R. Box.) [See text.) the intestine. " Thus the transverse mesocolon and great omentum, passing across the belly cavity, mark off an upper from a lower terri- tory, which communicate with one another only in the lumbar regions. This partition is more complete on the left than the right side, especi- ally when the phrenicocolic fold of peritoneum, which passes from the left end of the transverse colon to the diaphragm below the spleen, is well marked. A similar fold is sometimes present on the right side." (C. R. Box.) Above this transverse mesocolic shelf, and on the right slope of the vertebral watershed, lie the pylorus, the commencement of the duodenum, the gall-bladder, and the right lobe of the liver ; in a similar position on the left side lie the stomach and spleen. Effusions resulting from the perforation or inflammation of these structures will

DILATATION OF FIBROUS STRICTURE 281 Von Hacker has invented an ingenious method of dilating tight and difficult strictures. The instrument (Fig. 355, c), consisting of a rubber drainage-tube stretched on a central guide of whalebone or other stiff material, is inserted into the stricture. When the guide is withdrawn the tube shortens and retracts, with corresponding expan- sion of its circumference. This rubber tube is left in the stricture for some time, and thus the stricture is uniformly dilated. The guide must be well oiled to ob- viate difficulty in with- ^ - - drawal. In my experience this method is unsatisfactory for very tight strictures. A straight, rigid guide is diffi- cult to introduce and to engage in the opening of the stricture. (6) Continuous dilatation. ■—A hollow tube with a funnel-shaped upper end is passed down by means of an introducer and left in situ. Symonds's well-known tubes are of the greatest value and the best for this purpose (Fig. 356, A to d). They are especially useful when there is much diffi- culty in passing bougies, and if the patient is in urgent need of nourishment. When multiple strictures are present, as is not in- frequent, a short Symonds's tube will dilate the upper, and perhaps more constricted, jjortion, and so permit later access to the lower part of the a?sophagus. These tubes may be left in for a week or ten days at a time. In strictures in the upper part of the oesophagus the long, upper, funnel-shaped end is apt to irritate the larynx. In a case of mine this was obviated by cutting down the funnel. The tube is kept in situ by silk which comes out of the mouth or nose and is fixed to the auricle. It is a good plan, if the silk is passed out of the moutli, to thread upon it a piece of small rubber drainage-tube. This prevents the possi- bility of the silk being bitten through if an anaesthetic has been given. Fig. 356.—Symonds's tubes. .\, Symonds's long tube; R, introducer; c, D, Symonds's short tubes.

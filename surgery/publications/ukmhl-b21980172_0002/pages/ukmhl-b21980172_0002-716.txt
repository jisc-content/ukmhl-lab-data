66o RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL longitudinal muscle fibres of the rectum are prolonged as a thin investment to the canal, and the levator ani also encloses it. The circular muscle fibres are considerably thickened, and constitute the internal sphincter. This is about 1 in. in vertical extent, and is easily detected on digital examination. Being merely a thickening of circular muscle fibres, it should have a similar action, and should, therefore, empty the bowel (Cunningham). Clinical experience, however, teaches that whereas the external sphincter may be cut with impunity, division of m/ J^^^HIH^ W \ both sphincters may cause faecal ff/a^^^HHSK \ incontinence.

The anal canal shows eight or nine vertical folds composed of mucous membrane and muscularis mucosae—the columns of Morgagni (Fig. 480). These are permanent, not effaced by distension, well marked in the foetus, and constant throughout life. Occasionally they are ill marked, rarely they are absent. The columns are broader below, and gradually taper above. Their bases (anal ends) are connected by a circumferential irregular " zig-zag "

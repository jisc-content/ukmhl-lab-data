HARE-LIP: ROSE'S OPERATION 139 skin and the red border of the lip, on each side of the defect (Pig. 308). The points at which these incisions terminate must be selected with care, for, if they are placed too far apart, the " Cupid's bow" curve of the lip will be too exaggerated when suturing is completed ; and if they are too close to the margins of the cleft, the red border will be horizontal at the completion of the operation, and notched upwards when cicatricial contraction has taken place. From the termination of the first incision a second incision is carried inwards and upwards exactly between the veimilion border and the skin, to emerge about the middle of the cleft and form two long flaps of mucous membrane. These are inverted, and when the raw surfaces are sutured a well-marked projection is formed X T T Fig. 308.—Rose's operation. at the margin of the lip. If the flaps are too long, the redundant portions can always be removed before suturing is completed. Mirault's operation.—This operation is employed when the two sides of the cleft are of unequal length, differently curved, or widely divergent. To obtain a good result a certain degree of mathematical accuracy is required in paring the edge and shaping the flap. On the more oblique side of the cleft (Fig. 309) a point, a, is selected at, or just below, the centre of the curve ; a' represents a point in the normal line of the lip perpendicularly below a ; c is situated at the junction of the horizontal and vertical borders of the steeper side of the cleft; B marks the termination of the flap incision. The distance between b and c must equal the distance between a and a'. The oblique side of the cleft is pared by the concave incisions da, e a, leaving a projection at a. On the opposite side, a flap B D c is formed. This is turned down and applied to the raw surface opposite, so that the projection at a fits into the angle formed at b. The redundant tissue at the apex

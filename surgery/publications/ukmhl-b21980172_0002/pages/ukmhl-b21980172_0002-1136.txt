THE FALLOPIAN TUBE ligament and uterus, adherent intestine and omentum, and the ab- dominal parietes. In the second, the sac expands the broad ligament, pushes the uterus to the opposite side of the pelvis, and gradually rises into the abdomen by stripping the peritoneum off the side wall of the pelvis and iliac fossa until at term it may lie nearly centrally under the peritoneum in front of the spine and great vessels. A gestation in a secondary sac may rupture, but it sometimes goes on to term, when " spurious labour " takes place, the uterus expelling a decidual cast. The foetus then dies, usually within a month, and is Fig. 614.—Ruptured tubal pregnancy at four months. The sac is tubo-peritoneal. The opposite tube is in a condition of hematosalpinx. gradually converted into adipocere and subsequently calcified, forming a lithopsedion. A sequestered extra-uterine foetus may remain in the abdomen for forty years without causing trouble. More commonly, however, the sac inflames and suppurates, multiple sinuses are formed communicating in the case of intraperitoneal sacs with the bowel or umbilicus, and in the case of intraligamentous sacs with the skin above the groin, the bladder, or the vagina. Condition of the uterus.—The uterus in extra-uterine pregnancy enlarges so that at full term it is about the size of a three-months' intra-uterine pregnancy. A decidual hypertrophy of the endometrium also occurs, and may be cast off entire after rupture of the primary gestation sac. This only occurs, however, in a minority of cases ;

309 TESTS FOR GASTRIC ACIDITY 4. Examination of stomach contents.—Chemical examination of the contents of the stomach should be made in every case, and the amounts of total and free HCl estimated. The contents of the stomach should be obtained by means of the stomach-tube after a test meal. Examination of the vomit, useful for certain purposes, does not supply the necessary information (p. 310). Attempts have been made to estimate the motor power of the stomach, apart from examination of the stomach contents, after a Fig. 364.—Radiograph of an hour-glass stomach after a bismuth meal. (Sclin//.^ test meal. The salol test of Ewald is based upon the fact that salol is decomposed into carbolic and salicylic acids in an alkaline medium, the latter appearing in the urine as salicyluric acid normally in about an hour. The test is not altogether reliable, as the salol may be decomposed in the stomach owing to the presence of alkaline mucus, or delayed in the intestine owing to acid fermentation. A similar test is made with iodipin. One gram of iodipin is given in a capsule immediately after a meal ; normally, iodine can be detected in the saliva in forty-five minutes. Attempts have also been made to estimate the acidity of the gastric contents without the passage of the stomach- tube. In Giinzburg's method a tablet of 0-2 grm. of potassium iodide is inserted into a thin rubber tube, the ends folded, and the packet

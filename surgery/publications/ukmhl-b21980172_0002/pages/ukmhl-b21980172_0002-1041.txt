963 VARICOCELE th ere is right angle ; the presence of the iliac colon on the left side pressing on the vein ; the greater contraction of the muscles on the left side of the abdomen owing to the more extensive use of the right arm. Pathological anatomy.—The veins of the pampiniform plexus are lengthened, dihited, tortuous, and increased in number (Fig. 572). Their muscular coats become atrophied, and fibrosis of the adventitia, so that the walls are thickened and the veins stand open like arteries when cut across. PhleboUths may be present in them. The skin of the scrotum is lax, tliin, and moist, and is deficient in the power of healthy contraction. The testes are very pendulous, and the patient may complain that the left testis is atropine. It is extremely doubtful if varicocele ever leads to serious atrophy of the testis, and certainly in the great majority of cases there is no loss of sexual power even with a very large varicocele. Symptoms. — The disease is most frequently discovered on medical examination prior to enter- ing one of the public services, the patient being unaware that he has any pathological condition. In some cases there is a feeling of weight and discomfort, increased by stand- ing, exercise, or hot weather, and in others there are attacks of pain which may be severe (neuralgia of the testis). The condition is readily recognized from the long, lax con- dition of the scrotum, the charac- teristic feel of the distended veins, " like a bag of worms," and the dilated and tortuous veins of the scrotum. On recumbence it is less marked, but it is aggravated by standing, warmth, and exercise. To the patient the testis may feel more flabby than on the normal side, but, as stated above, atrophy is rare. Treatment.—Tliis may be either 'palliative or operative. The former consists in wearing a suspensory bandage, the best variety being 'o Fig. 572. —Dilated veins from varicocele.

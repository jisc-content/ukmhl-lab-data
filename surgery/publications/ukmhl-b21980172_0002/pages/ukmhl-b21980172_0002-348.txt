312 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM CONGENITAL STRICTURE AND OCCLUSION OF THE DUODENUM These are rare conditions. Out of 13 cases of congenital occlusion or stenosis of the intestines (other than those in connexion with the rectum) collected by Barnard from the records of the London Hospital, in no instance was the duodenum affected. Out of 185 cases of congenital occlusion of the intestines collected by Kuliga, 46 were of the duodenum. Schlegel, quoted by Braun, states that occlusion occurs in the duodenum in 32'5 per cent, of the cases. There may be a septum, with or without a perforation in its centre, running across the bowel, composed of the muscular as well as of the mucous and submucous coats. The interruption of the duodenum may be complete.

Occlusion is more common than stenosis; in 57 cases collected by Cordes, it was present in 48. Occlusion or stenosis is occasionally present at the junction of the duodenum and jejunum (5 out of 57 cases, Cordes). As a rule, vomiting occurs soon after birth, its character depending on the position of the atresia or stenosis, but in the case of stenosis the symptoms may be delayed, one case having been recorded in a girl of 13 (Shaw and Baldauf). Treatment.—If the condition is recognized, gastro-jejunostomy offers the only hope of saving life. ACQUIRED STRICTURE OF THE DUODENUM This condition is usually the result of chronic ulceration, and in the later stages may bring about dilatation of the stomach. A stricture may also result from affections of the pancreas, or from adhesions due to gall-stones.

Tliis narrowing may be due to defective development of the segment implicated, or to cicatricial contraction following idcera- tion of the gut at the opening of the pouch, or it may result from traction exerted on the gut by the di- verticulum or its me- sentery. 3. Intussuscep- tion is sometimes originated by a Meck- el's diverticulum be- coming inverted and projecting into the lumen of the ileum, where it forms the apex of the intussus- ception. 4. Volvulus has been produced by the weight of a dis- tended Meckel's di- verticulum rotating the bowel on its me- senteric axis ; or the diverticulum may it- self be twisted on its long axis. The com- bination of volvulus and kinldng is not uncommon. 5. By far the most common complication is strangulation of the bowel by the diverticulum acting as a band. When the diverticulum remains attached to the um- bilicus and stretches across the abdomen (Fig. 397), a coil of bowel may be kinked over it, hanging like a towel over a rope.

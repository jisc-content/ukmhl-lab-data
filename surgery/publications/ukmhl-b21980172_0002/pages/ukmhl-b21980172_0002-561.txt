INTESTINAL TUBERCULOSIS 1. Tuberculous Ulceration The ulcerative form is most frequently met witli in young subjects who suffer from pulmonary phthisis or from some other tuberculous condition. Its chief sur- gical interest lifes in the fact that the cicatricial contraction which accom- panies the healing of such ulcers leads to stenosis of the bowel. The lower end of the ileum is the most common seat of the disease, the in- fection taldng place from bacilli that have been swallowed in the sputum, or taken in with milk or (tther food, and have be- come implanted in the Peyer's patches and soli- tary glands. As the foci break down and caseate, they form small, irregu- larly oval ulcers in the mucous membrane, the rdges of which are ele- vated (Fig. 423) and often indurated. Such ulcers tend to spread circularly round the gut, and, as they heal at one ■part while spreading at another, the contraction of the cica- tricial tissue leads to ste- nosis of the bowel—one form of tuberculous stric- ture (PMes, 95, 96). There may be several strictures scattered over a consider- able length of intestine, the intervening segments being -Tuberculous ulceration of dilated and sacculated in the intestine. a characteristic manner. {.vuscum, Koya!

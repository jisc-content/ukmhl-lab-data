EXCLUSION OF GANGRENOUS BOWEL 653 3. When the gangrenous portions are situated one in the small and the other in the large bowel, the former may be resected and the latter converted into an artificial anus for the time being, when the patient cannot stand two resections. 4. Extensive resections are attended by a mortality which is largely in inverse ratio to the sldll and rapidity of the operator. For tliis reason, in unpractised hands, the emergency is best met by the tliird method, viz. exclusion of the affected loop and the formation of an intestinal fistula. For this purpose, the somid bowel having been brought down to Fig. 475.â€”Exclusion of gangrenous bowel and formation of intestinal fistula. <7, Sutures joining loops ; A, gangrenous sections ; r, rod supporting Ijowel ; bowel clamp : i", ey i', r, ligatures on bowel ; f^/-, PauTs tubes in cut ends; Paul's tube in excluded loop ; site of incision in loop. the ring, the entering and returning coils are connected side by side by one or two interrupted sutures (Fig. 475, a) some distance from the gangrenous portions (&), and are supported by a short length of rubber- covered glass rod (c) passed beneath the imion. A clamp (d) is applied just distally to the union, and a ligature (e) is placed round each portion of the bowel about \\ in. beyond the clamp. Finally, the bowel is divided between the clamp and the ligatures ; a Paul's tube (/) is introduced into each cut end, being fixed by a purse-string suture, and the clamp is removed. An incision should be made into the loop at the point (/;), and, if necessary, a third Paul's tube (r/) intro- duced to prevent it from becoming distended with gas and fluid. The

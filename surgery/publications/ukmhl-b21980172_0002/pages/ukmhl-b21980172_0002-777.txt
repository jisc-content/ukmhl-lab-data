RECTAL CARCINOMA 719 the lumen of the bowel may be long delayed, and indeed in a few cases tlie disease may run its course without symptoms of obstruction appearing; in others again, symptoms of obstruction may be the initial manifestation, and in such the disease has advanced insidiously and assumed large proportions without symptoms of rectal ulceration. If untreated, rectal carcinoma leads to a fatal issue in about one and a half to two years on the average. Not infrequently life is ter- minated by acute intestinal obstruction, arising in various ways. Most commonly the bowel above the con- ^ ■ •^^--fi^ s,^^ striction becomes ex- . ^'4^^%(t Jf-!:J%]Ji . tussuscepted into the lower bowel. Very infrequently the small lumen left by the invad- ing growth may be occluded by a ftecal mass or foreign body, such as cherry- or plum-stones. In a few cases peritonitis may cause death. Bowel distended by mechanical obstruction is predisposed, partly by virtue of its impeded circulation, to infection. In cancer of the rectum the pelvic colon or cajcuni may thus become acutely infected, and necrosis of the walls may result, with local or diffused peritonitis, which is practically always fatal. liausted, and the colon progressively dilates. Occasionally the dis- tended pelvic colon may undergo torsion around its mesenteric axis. In any obstruction of the large bowel the caecum may be the most dis- tended part, and occa- sionally an acute dila- tation of the caecum may be the initial evi- dence of failing com- pensation. Should such a caecum have retained its original peritoneal relationships, and be suspended by a mesen- tery, a volvulus around its mesenteric axis may occur. Rarely the dis- eased part becomes in- Fig. 515.—Edge of a malignant ulcer of rectum, showing typical appearance of columnar-celled cancer.

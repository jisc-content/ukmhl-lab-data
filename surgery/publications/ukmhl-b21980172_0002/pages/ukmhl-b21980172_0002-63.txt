41 SOFT FIBRO-ADENOMA but is richly cellular. It may be made up of fusiform cells, sometimes mixed with more fully developed fibrous tissue. In other cases the tissue resembles myxomatous tissue, presenting stellate cells with abundant mucoid intercellular substance. This appearance is prob- ably the result of mucoid degeneration of ordinary fibrous tissue.

The embryonic nature of the fibrous stroma of these tumours indicates their close connexion with the sarcomas, and indeed they were formerly called adeno- sarcomas. The case recorded by Beatson, and represented in Fig. 262, is a typical instance of a large fibro-adenoma of the soft variety. The

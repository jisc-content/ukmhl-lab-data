546 THE APPENDIX Amongst tliese may be mentioned an indefinite feeling of malaise, indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea, and vague abdominal discomfort. Whether preceded by prodromal symptoms or not, the attack begins with an acute pain in the abdomen, often quite sudden in its onset, which at first cannot be localized and may be referred to the epi- gastrium or to the umbilicus. The pain is rapidly followed by nausea and vomiting, and this is very soon succeeded by a rise of temperature, occasionally with an initial rigor, accompanied by the usual consti- tutional symptoms of toxic fever. The bowels may act once or twice after the onset, but then constipation usually becomes a promin- ent feature. Excep- tionally the bowels act naturally throughout, and some of the severer cases are attended with diarrhoea. Examination shortly after the onset shows the ab- domen to be rigid, motionless, and uni- formly tender; these signs soon become localized to the right iliac region, and the spot of most acute tenderness is commonly found to correspond with McBurney's point. The abdomen is usually a little distended, and may be markedly so ; the distension may be limited to the lower half of the abdomen, and even to the right iliac region. Very soon an indefinite swelling can be felt in the right iliac fossa, which in two or three days becomes palpable as a more or less definite mass. Muscular rigidity often causes a localized swelling which may readily be mistaken for a subjacent inflammatory tumour. In some cases symptoms referable to the bladder are present, namely, pain, frequency of micturition, or retention of urine. Rectal pain and tenesmus may also be experienced. In these instances examination per rectum usually reveals the pre- sence of a tender inflammatory mass in the right side of the pelvis.

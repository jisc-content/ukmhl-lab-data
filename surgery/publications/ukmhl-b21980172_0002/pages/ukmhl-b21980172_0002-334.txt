298 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM stomach. The pressure here has been shown by Sick to be only 6 to 8 cm. of water, with slight and irregular variations. The musculature of the pyloric portion of the stomach is thick and is the seat of peristaltic waves which occur at intervals of about fifteen to twenty seconds, beginning about thirty minutes after a meal. In the early stages of digestion the pylorus is closed and a central reflux of food occurs, the mass being pushed backwards and forwards and thoroughly triturated and mixed with the gastric juice. As digestion proceeds, the pressure in this part of the stomach varies from 20 to 60 cm. of Fig. 361.â€”Mid-gastric sphincter, as depicted by Sir Everard Home. (After Keith.) water. Recent work by Barclay and Hertz's later observations have thrown some doubt on the separation into two compartments as seen on X-ray examination. Since Beaumont's time it has been considered that the acidity of the gastric contents causes relaxation of the pylorus. But it is more probable that the pylorus relaxes with each peristaltic wave which sweeps over the pyloric portion of the stomach, unless inhibited by reflexes set up by the presence of free acid in the first portion of the duodenum (Pavlov). The presence in the stomach of solid particles, or of fluids warmer or colder than the body temperature, also causes closure of the pylorus. The time at which the food leaves the stomach varies with its nature ; carbohydrates pass out first, then fats and proteins. The cardiac portion of the stomach is empty before the pyloric ; about six hours after a full meal, or three and a half to four after a light meal, the whole stomach should be empty.

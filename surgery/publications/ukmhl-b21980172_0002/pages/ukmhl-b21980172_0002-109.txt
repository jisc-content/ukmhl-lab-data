83 DUCT CANCER period, and even for many years, without giving rise to any palpable tumour. Sometimes in these cases enlargement of the axillary glands and the later signs of dissemination remain absent, and the descrip^ tion "atrophic scirrhus " is appropriate (see p. 79). In other cases, however, though the primary growth remains of microscopic size, enlargement of the axillary glands occurs, and the glands may even reach the size of chestnuts. These cases were formerly described as primary cancer of the axillary glands. In such cases, if the glands are Fig. 281.—The edge of a mobile (non-infiltrating) carcinoma of the breast under a low magnification ( x 5). The growth was sur- rounded by a capsule of fibrous tissue almost as definite as that of a fibro-adenoma. Cf. Fig. 280. cancerous and no other primary focus can be found, the breast should be removed, and, as in a case of which Dr. Macnaughton Jones informs me, thorougli microscopical examination may reveal a minute mammary carcinoma. Halsted has met with two similar cases. The facts of impalpable carcinoma have an important bearing upon the pathology of Paget's disease of the nipple {see p. 10). In certain cases which simulate impalpable carcinoma, a primary growth originating at the axillary edge of the breast may be mistaken for an enlarged axillary gland. Mobile carcinoma of the breast—It is too often assimied that a carcinoma of the breast is always fir'mly fixed in the organ. This

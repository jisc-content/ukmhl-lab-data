GALL-STONE DISEASE 751 Internal fistulas are probably commoner than external, but remain unrecognized owing to their frequent lack of symptoms. They usually pass between the gall-bladder and the stomach, duodenum, or colon, but they may be between the gall-bladder and the kidney, the lung, or even the bladder or uterus. Stricture of the ducts.—This condition is only common in the cystic duct, where it frequently follows the impaction of a calculus. It is best treated by cholecystectomy.

In the common duct stricture is much more important, but, for- tunately, rarer. It usually follows long impaction of a calculus, and presents the symptoms of obstructive jaundice with or without attacks of pain. Treatment.—Plastic restoration of the duct may be possible, but in most cases, if the gall-bladder is available for the purpose, chole- cystenterostomy is the wiser procedure.

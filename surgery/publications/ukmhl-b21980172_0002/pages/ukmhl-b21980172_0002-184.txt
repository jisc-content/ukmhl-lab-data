156 FACE, LIPS. AND PALATE palate from f to k. All that now remains is to take the large flap ABODE, turn it inwards, tuck it under the raised muco-periosteum z A F in front, and cover it behind with the flap F G H, as in Fig. 323. Sutures are then inserted, as shown in Fig. 323, fii-st along the line BCD, uniting the free edge of the reflected flap to the raised flap and to the raw surface on the nasal aspect of the soft palate ; next, along the line d h G, uniting the free edges of the soft palate ; and lastly, a third row, a F g, uniting the reflected flap to the free edge of the raised flap, A F, and to the edge, f g, of the flap that has been turned inwards B Figs. 322 and 323.â€”Arbuthnot Lane's operation (see text). from the nasal surface of the soft palate. When the nasal septum occupies the middle line, as in Fig. 322, the reflected flap may be fixed to it by an additional row of sutures (a x, Fig. 323), provided that the mucous membrane is removed from the edge of the septum and from the surface of the reflected flap along the area of apposition. Though this row of sutures is not essential, it constitutes a refinement which gives additional security to, and increases the blood supply of, the reflected flap. The remaining diagrams, illustrating the application of these methods to different varieties of clefts, need but a brief description, as the principles underlying the operations are the same in every case. Fig. 324 illustrates a complete cleft in which the nasal septum is adherent to the right margin. The reflected flap should always be formed from the side of the cleft to which the septum is adherent, as it obtains an additional supply of blood, from the septal vessels at its attached border, along the margin of the cleft. If the cleft is

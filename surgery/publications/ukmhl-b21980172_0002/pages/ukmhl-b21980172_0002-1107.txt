Microscopically it presents tliree types of cell—(1) closely set hyaline mononucleated cells identical witli tlie Langhans cells of tlie normal chorionic villus ; (2) larger cells of the same type laden with granules ; and (3) large multinucleated masses of protoplasm (syncytia) similar to those seen on the periphery of the villus of an early gestation. These cells are embedded in masses of fibrin and extensive blood extravasa- Fig. 595.—Chorion-epithelioma, showing syncytia and ILanghans' cells. tions. The microscopic appearance of a chorion-epithelioma (Fig. 595) is exactly that of the tissues at the growing margin of an early gestation. Modern research shows, indeed, that in the process of the embedding of the human ovum its trophoblast acts practically as a malignant tissue, destroying the maternal tissue with which it comes in contact. Normally, this infiltrative power is arrested after the first few weeks of the life of the gestation ; occasionally, however, it persists and leads to malignant growth. Metastasis occurs with great rapidity, pulmonary nodules being particularly common.

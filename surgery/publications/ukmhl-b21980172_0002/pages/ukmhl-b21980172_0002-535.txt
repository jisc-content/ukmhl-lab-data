ACUTE INTUSSUSCEPTION IN CHILDREN 489 the apposed serous surfaces, renders the intussusception irreducible. The laxity of the outer wall of the Cfecum admits of its slipping farther down than the rest of the intussusceptum, so that it may even be in advance of the true apex, and after reduction a characteristic " dimple " remains for a time on the lower and outer part of the ctecal wall (Fig. 419). In time the swelling of the implicated bowel and the contraction ■of the sheath in its attempts to expel the intussusceptum oc- clude the lumen and lead to complete ob- struction. The interference with tlie nutrition of the bowel is followed by bacterial invasion of the coats, which may determine gan- grene or lead to peritonitis. The gangrene af- fects first and cliiefly the returning tube, then the entering tube, but it rarely im- plicates the sheath. In a certain number of cases the whole intussusceptum has undergone necrosis and been separated as a blackish-green tubular slough, vary- ing in length from a few inches to seve- ral feet, and recovery has in very rare instances followed the ex]>ulsion of such a slough. Clinical features.—Intussusception is the most common cause of acute obstruction in children, and the cHnical picture is usually so characteristic as to leave little doubt regarding the diagnosis. Nearly 75 per cent, of the cases occur during the first year of life, and about 70 per cent, are in boys. The subjects of this condition are, as a rule, fine lusty infants, and are in apparently perfect health when attacked.

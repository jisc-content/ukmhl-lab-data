36q the stomach AND DUODENUM complicating many diseases, especially those in which sepsis is present. There is a close association between chronic appendicitis and duodenal ulcer; it is probable that the appendix is the source of the infection in many cases. Burns—Ulcers occurring in the duodenum complicating severe burns were described by Curling in 1842 (Fig. 377) ; and it is said they may also be present in the stomach, and in the intestine lower down. Usually single, they are met with most often in the first portion and begin as hsemorrhagic ero- sions. They are said to occur, as a rule, from seven to fourteen days after the burn, but they may be dis- covered earlier—in one case (Parfick) they were seen within eighteen hours. These ulcers often lead to a fatal issue within a few days from haemorrhage or perforation. They were more frequently met with by older writers. Thus, Fenwick, from the statistics of Holmes, Erichsen, Perry and Shaw, found this com- plication in 6-2 per cent, of all fatal cases of burns. These ulcers are now not often found after burns, and some authors deny that the two conditions are associated. Various explanations have been given of the development of these acute ulcers, but they are probably of toxgemic origin, and can thus be brought into line with other acute peptic ulcers (p. 342). Age.—Duodenal ulcers may be met with at any age. Cases have been recorded of the perforation of a duodenal ulcer in an infant of 21 hours, and of death from haemorrhage from a duodenal ulcer in an infant 2 days old.

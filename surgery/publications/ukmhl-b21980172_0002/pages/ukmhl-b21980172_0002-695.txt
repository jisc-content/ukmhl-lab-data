With very young and restless children it may even be advisable to apply some form of retentive apparatus, such as a vertical suspension as for fractured femur, or a Thomas's hip splint slightly bent to a suitable shape and fixed by plaster bandages. Elderly subjects should be treated either with a bed-rest or a double inchned plane, the latter being very much the better (Fig. 466).

It may occur at any time in the life-history of a hernia, and is not infrequently the first evidence of the presence of hernia. It is met with in all the forms of hernia already mentioned, as well as in certain others

580 HERNIA By LAWRIE McGAVIN, F.R.C.S.Eng. Structure of a hernia—With certain exceptions a hernia consists of (1) a sac, (2) its coverings, and (3) its contents. In some hernias, to be described later, the sac is partially or wholly absent, and in some, although present, it may be devoid of contents from time to time. The hernial sac consists of peritoneum, and is either present at birth, or is formed subsequently as the result of pathological changes in the abdominal wall. It is usually described as having a neck, a body, and a fundus. The neck is that part which occupies the aperture through which the hernia escaped. It is commonly narrow, being constricted by the surrounding tissues, and when unoccupied is flattened from before backwards. Occasionally, however, it is the widest part of the sac. In its earliest condition, the peritoneum of the neck resembles that from which it springs ; it is quite free from the surrounding struc- tures, and is lined by normal glistening endothelium. In children it is very thin, and in all inguinal or femoral hernias the posterior wall is tliinner than the anterior. The hod^j is usually wider than the neck, and is at first unilocular. Subsequently it may enlarge to remarkable dimensions and become altered in character. A sac may exist which has never been occu- pied by contents, in which case it rarely attains to great size and may retain the original character of the parietal peritoneum. The fundus, or extreme end, is usually, though not always, the oldest part of the sac. Since the iliac peritoneum is more readily dragged down than the parietal, there is in inguinal and femoral hernias a tendency for the original point of protrusion to lag beliind; the fundus may thus be formed from the peritoneum which was derived from the iliac fossa.

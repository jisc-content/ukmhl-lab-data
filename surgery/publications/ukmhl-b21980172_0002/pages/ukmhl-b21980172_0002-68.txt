THE BREAST 46 it does not seem to reach sucli a size. It does not adhere to the skin or fascia, but appears fixed in the breast. Enlarged veins may be seen coursing over it. In my own case, referred to on p. 45, the tumour appeared to constitute the whole breast, and but for its unilateral character a diagnosis of hypertrophy would have suggested itself. Treatment. — Enucleation should be attempted unless the tumour is very large. In that case, amputation of the breast may be necessary. DUCT PAPILLOMA OF THE BREAST (PAPILLARY CYST- ADENOMA, PROLIFEROUS CYSTS) ^ Tliis is a condition in which papillomatous elevations arise from the lining epithelium of the ducts. Serous discharge and often bleed- ing occur from the papillomatous masses. Thus the characteristic but not invariable feature of the disease is a blood-stained serous discharge from the nipple. Duct obstruction and consequent distension with serous discharge frequently occur, and produce the cysts characteristic of certain forms of the disease. Duct papil- loma is not malignant, but in the course of years fre- quently passes into duct carcinoma. Etiology.—Duct papil- loma appears to be unknown before puberty, and to be most frequent towards the end of active sexual life. It may, however, occur in old age, and has been recorded in the male breast. It occurs equally in the married and the unmarried. Morbid anatomy— Since the larger ducts con- verge upon the nipple, it is beneath or near the nipple that clinically appreciable duct papil- lomas are most often found. AH the ducts may be afiected, but very often the disease is confined to one or several of the mammary lobes. 1 See also Vol. I., p. 453.

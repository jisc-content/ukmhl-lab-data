712 RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL Fig. 507. — Adenomatous polypi from a child and an adult. Fig. 508.—Two pedunculated adenomas. adenoma and carcinoma may be present simultaneously. The symptom is painless haemor- rhage ; sometimes tliis is accompanied by mucoid discharge. If the adenoma originate low in the rectum, or if the pedicle be sufficiently long, the polyp may protrude through the anus. Rarely will the pedicle become gripped by the sphincters, and the tumour slough off. An adenoma is seldom (probably never in the cliild) of sufficient size to cause impedi- ment to the passage of faeces. A simple neoplasm may be the starting-point of an intussusception of the rectum. Diagnosis.—When the tumour is pedunculated the diagnosis is easy, as by digital examination the pedicle can usually be felt; if the tumour be high-lying a sigmoidoscopic examination will always reveal the true condition. The diagnosis of a sessile adenoma can often only be made by micro- scopy. Treatment.—An ade- noma should always be re- moved. In the child it is sufficient to cut it off after ligaturing, cauterizing, clamp- ing, or twisting the pedicle. In the adult similar treat- ment will suffice for an ob- viously pedunculated and undoubtedly innocent tu- mour. If there exist any suspicion of malignant dis- ease, the base of attachment and the adjacent mucosa should be removed, and sub- mitted to microscopy; and if malignant transformation be found, the case must be treated accordingly.

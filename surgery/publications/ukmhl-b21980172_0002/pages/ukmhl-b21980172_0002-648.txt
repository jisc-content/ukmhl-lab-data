HERNIA 592 pain, tenderness in the hernia, distension of the abdomen, and the presence of peristaltic waves. Such signs are an indication for early- operation. Anatomical Varieties of Hernia Of the weak spots of the abdominal wall at which hernias may appear, the inguinal canal is by far the most frequently involved; here two varieties of hernia are met with, viz. oblique and direct. Oblique inguinal hernia (Fig. 446).—This form of hernia makes its exit at the internal abdominal ring, and, passing along Fig. 446.—Oblique inguinal hernia becoming inguino-scrotal; also early umbilical hernia. the spermatic cord in the male, or the round ligament of the uterus in the female, leaves the canal at the external abdominal ring, and enters, in the former case the scrotum (Fig. 447), and in the latter the labium majus. The neck of the sac thus has the deep epigastric artery as its immediate internal relation. An obUque inguinal hernia is invariably clothed by certain struc- tures known as its " coverings " ; these are best described in order of dissection, thus : (1) skin ; (2) superficial fascia ; (3) aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle and its arciform or intercolunmar fibres, commonly called the " external spermatic fascia " ; (4) cremasteric fascia, which is simply the stretched fibres of the cremaster muscle ; (5) " internal spermatic fascia " or infundibuliform fascia, a finger-like

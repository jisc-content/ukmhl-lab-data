756 GALL-BLADDER AND BILE-DUCTS the lower thoracic region. Then by drawing on the gall-bladder, lifting forward the liver and rotating it on its transverse axis, the surgeon can straighten out the ducts and approximate the deeper parts still further to the surface. The operator must remember to remove the sand - bag before i - , attempting to su- ture the wound. A transverse incision may be used in- stead ; this affords excellent exposure of the gall-bladder, ducts, and hepatic pouch (Fig. 531). Before opening the gall-bladder, care- ful examination must be made of the whole biliary apparatus, and of the liver, pylorus,, duodenum, pancre- atic head, and he- patic flexure. The ducts are palpated by passing the fingers along the right side of the gall-bladder, over its neck, down the cystic duct, and through the fora- men of Winslow. Here the common duct can be felt between the fingers behind and the thumb in front of the gastro-hepatic omentum. The lower parts of the duct must be felt for through the duodenal wall. Finally, the hepatic ducts are to be explored right up to the liver. It must be remembered that Fig. 531.â€”Exposure obtained by the transverse incision for gall-stones advocated by Rutherford Morison.

The fingers of the operator are in the foramen of Winslow, steadying and thrusting forward the lesser omentum, while the thumb is free to palpate the common duct. {B7-it. ]\Ied.

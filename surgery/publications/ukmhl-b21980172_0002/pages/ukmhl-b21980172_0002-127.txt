MAMMARY SARCOMA lOI Through the opening thus formed a vascular mass of growth, often sloughy in appearance, rapidly protrudes (Fig. 288). and the patient frequently succumbs to hajmorrhage and exhaustion before dissemi- nation has taken place. In some cases, however, numerous secondary deposits are found in the internal organs, the bones, and the lymphatic glands. Fig. 288.â€”Fungating sarcoma of the breast. Chondro-Sarcoma of the Breast In rare cases, sarcomas of the breast may contain areas of cartilage. Such cliondro-sarcomas sometimes undergo calcification, or true bone with well-marked Haversian systems may be formed in them. The patients are middle-aged or old; the tumours are characterized by their stony hardness, but portions of them may be soft and fluctuating owing to the liquefaction of areas of cartilage. These tumours may quickly recur after operation, and may become disseminated. Calcified cartilage has been detected in the secondary deposits (Bland-Sutton). In a case of chondro-sarcoma recently under my care a duct papilloma had been excised from the breast five years previously.

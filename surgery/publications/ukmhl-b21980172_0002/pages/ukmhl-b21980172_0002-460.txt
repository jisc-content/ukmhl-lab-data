4i8 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM of the jejunum can be used for anastomosis, and thus less of this important part of the intestine is looped up and thrown out of use. 3. There is no necessity for the formation of a loop with its attendant dangers of internal hernia and obstruction, and therefore symptoms of the so-called " vicious circle " or regurgitant vomiting. 4. There is less danger of the formation of a peptic ulcer. If the anterior method be carried out without a loop in the way I have described the results are as good as in the pos- terior, but, as it is more diffi- cult of employment and alters the anatomical relation of parts more, it should not be employed where the posterior operation is possible. (Fig- 393.) Gastro-Duodenostomy This operation is rarely employed, except as Finney's modification.whichis explained by Fig. 394. It is useful in cases of fibrous stricture of the pylorus and certain cases of gastroptosis. JEJUNOSTOMY This should be done by Mayo Robson's method. A loop of jejunum is taken as high as possible, allowing sufficient length to reach the abdominal wall easily. The two arms of the loop are short-circuited by lateral anastomosis. An opening is made at the top of the loop, then a No. 12 catheter is inserted and passed for 3 in. into the distal limb of the loop, and the margin of the open- ing inverted by two purse-string sutures. The apex of the loop IS fixed to the skin. 394.â€”Finney's operation of gastro-duodenostomy. BIBLIOGRAPHY Brinton, Lectures on the Diseases of the Stotnach, 2nd edit. London, 1864. Deaver, J.

726 RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL Hajmorrliage and diarrhoea may be relieved by curettage and cauterization, but the symptoms will almost surely recur, when the process may be repeated. Carcinoma op the Anal Canal Anal cancer (Fig. 517) originates from the lining of the anal canal or the skin of the anal margin. There is evidence to show that in a few cases it has grown from the edge of a chronic fissure or ulcer. Generally speak- ing, the squamous- celled tumour is of slower growth than the glandular can- cer, and usually cancer of the anal canal conforms to this rule. Anal can- cer is, however, of more rapid growth than many forms of skin cancer. The disease spreads (1) by continuity of tis- sue to the skin of the perineum (though it does not tend to infiltrate the rectal wall to any extent), (2) by the lymphatic system. The glands invaded are those Fig. 517. -Section of squamous-celled cancer of anal canal. in the groin—the oblique set of the inguinal glands. Symptoms.—Since the growth is at the anal margin, pain is present from the outset. At first only experienced when the bowels move, it later becomes more or less constant. Some blood-stained discharge occurs early, and this is constant, and independent of the bowel action. Pruritus ani may be severe. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction may or may not be present, depending upon the degree of occlusion of the anal canal. As the growth infiltrates the spliincters, incontinence of fijeces results. On examination there will be seen the typical appearance of a squamous-celled carcinoma. Diagnosis.—The disease has to be differentiated from a chronic indolent fissure, condylomata and gummatous ulceration at the anal margin, and also from tuberculous infiltration of the anal canal.

MALFORMATIONS OF THE FACE 127 MICROSTOMA ^Microstoma, or congenital atresia oris, is, as its name implies, the very reverse of macrostoma. This rare defect is the result of an excessive degree of fusion between the maxillary and mandibular processes, and may take place to such an extent as to leave an opening wliich will only admit a small probe. It must not be confused with acquired stenosis following cicatricial contraction after burns, sypliilitic ulcera- tion, lupus, etc. Treatmen t.— When necessary, the oral aperture may be elongated by incising the cheek at the angles of the mouth and suturing the mucous membrane to the skin. FACIAL CLEFT This is such a rare malformation that a passing reference to it will suffice. As already stated in the account of the development of the face, it is due to partial or total failure of imion between the maxillary process below and the lateral nasal and globular processes above. Another, and Fig. possibly more accurate, •explanation of the cause of facial, buccal, mandibular, and auricular clefts is ofiered by Ballantyne, who infers that they are due to the presence of amniotic adhesions and bands formed during morbid conditions of develop- ment, rather than to defective union of normal elements. The cleft, commencing in the red margin of the upper lip just externally to the philtrum, may extend to the middle of the lower eyelid, thence to the outer canthus, and, very rarely, into the temporal region. It may be bilateral and asymmetrical, as shown in Fig. 300, and usually involves only the soft parts. 300.—Mandibular cleft and two varieties of facial cleft.

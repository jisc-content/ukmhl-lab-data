RECTAL PAPILLOMA 713 Fig. 509.—Section of rectal adenoma. It, Papilloma of the Eectum The so-called vil- lous tumour of the rectum is rare ; it re- sembles the villous tumour of the blad- der and the pelvis of the kidney, and consists of a lobu- lated spongy mass, sessile or peduncu- lated, with long vil- lous tufts studding its surface; these tufts are composed of mucous membrane and are very vas- cular (Fig. 510). The villous tumour is confined to adult life, and is very liable to become malignant may be single or maltiple ; if pedunculated it always has a short and broad pedicle. The symptoms a r e ha;'morrhage and a glairy white dis- charge which seems characteristic. Oc- casionally the tu- mour may protrude through the anus, or portions may be- come detached and be passed in the m o t i o n s. The treatment is al- ways removal. The tumour, the pedicle if present, and the adjacent mucosa should be removed, the edges of the mucosa being su- tured. Microscopical W Fig. 510.—Section of rectal papilloma.

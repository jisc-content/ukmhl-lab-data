I032 THE UTERUS raises it out of the pelvis; while one growing from its back (Fig. 600) may undermine the peritoneum at the bottom of Douglas's pouch and gradually obliterate the pouch altogether. Cervical myomas grow- ing laterally invade the broad ligament. 3. Broad-ligament myomas. — Tumours growing laterally from the side of the corpus or cervix expand the broad ligament. These are not truly of the broad ligament. There are several tracts of un- striped muscle in the mesometrium from which true broad-liga- ment tumours may originate. (Fig. 601.) Thus, myomas of the ovarico'Uterine and round ligaments occur. Others are found occa- sionally springing from the muscle fibres that accompany the ovarian or uterine vessels. These may attain a large size, and, after distending the broad ligament to its fullest capacity, mount up into the abdomen by strip- ping the peritoneum off its posterior and lateral parietes. The pelvic colon thereby comes to lie sessile on the mass, while the uterus is forced to the opposite side. The ureter is dis- placed inwards with the peritoneum except in the rare cases of lateral cervical myomas growing very low down, when it may be raised bodily on the top of the tumour.

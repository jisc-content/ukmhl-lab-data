745 GALL-STONE DISEASE mucous membrane is reddened and tlie whole wall thickened (Fig. 524), while still later there may be ulceration or localized gangrene, though this usually only occurs when obstruction coexists. Haemorrhage may take place into such an inflamed gall-bladder. When the inflamma- tion becomes chronic the gall- bladder is thickened and exhibits fibroid changes, while the contents are in most cases purulent, forming " chronic empyema of the gall- l)ladder." Peritoneal adhesions commonly form and persist, and rarely they may cause trouble. Obstruction is mo.st com- monly produced by the impaction of a calculus in the neck of the gall-bladder, in its pelvis, or in tlie first compartment of the cystic duct. In the acute cases the con- sequences depend on the condition of the gall-bladder at the time of the impaction. If its contents be infected, the viscus raj)idly be- comes inflamed and acutely dis- tended, and its peritoneal coat soon becomes reddened and lymph- covered. The mucous membrane ulcerates, and gangrene may super- vene (Plate 100) and lead to per- foration or to extensive sloughings. An inflamed gall-bladder usually acquires adhesions to the stomach, <luodenum (Fig. 525), or hepatic flexure of the colon. It may sup- purate and burst into one of tlie adherent viscera, or more rarely through the belly wall, leading to the formation of an externa,l biliary fistula. When perforation occurs calculi as well as pus may thus calculus is of the large, single variety, and in these circumstances the gall-bladder contracts upon and firmly grasps the calculus, no further distension occurrins;, as the secreting glands in its wall have Fig. 524.â€”Acute inflammation of the gall-bladder, following im- paction of a calculus in its neck. into one of the hollow viscera, escape, but not uncommonly the

454 THE INTESTINES Fistulse may also originate in ulceration of the hoivel, such as some- times occurs in tuberculosis, in actinomycosis, and in malignant disease ; or from suppurative conditions around it, notably in appen- dicitis with sloughing of the wall of the csecum, and in perforation of the gut by foreign bodies. Sometimes the inflamed appendix becomes adherent to the parietes, and its lumen forms the track of the fistula —a condition of natural appendicostomy. Clinical features.—An intestinal fistula may be met with any- where on the abdominal wall, and it is not always easy to determine Fig. 405.—Faecal fistula originating deep in the abdomen. the part of the bowel with which it communicates. If the discharge is fluid, acid in reaction, and contains bile and undigested food, and if, further, it causes irritation and superficial ulceration of the skin, the opening probably leads into the upper part of the jejunum. This is rendered more probable if the patient emaciates rapidly and shows signs of starvation. The discharge from a fistula opening into the lower part of the small intestine is usually neutral or alkaline in reaction, and is less irritating to the skin; bile and undigested food material cannot be distinctly recognized. The discharge from a fistula in the colon is distinctly faecal; in the caecum it may be fluid and contain a considerable quantity of mucus ; in the lower parts of the colon it is solid or semi-solid.

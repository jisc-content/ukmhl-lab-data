THE VULVA 988 glandular enlargement. Their cause is unknown: clinically they re- semble aphthous ulcers of the mouth. Bathing with a simple antiseptic lotion suffices. LEUCOPLAKIC VULVITIS This very interesting affection has only lately been distinguished from kraurosis of the vulva.^ Its cause is unknown. It begins as a diffuse redness with intense itching, later on the surface becomes white from epithelial hypertrophy, and the thickened tissues retract^ so that the labia minora and hood of the clitoris almost disappear. The subepithelial changes consist of diffuse lymphocytosis, the appear- ance of plasma cells and complete disappearance of elastic fibres. (Fig. 579). Painful fissures may develop, and in many cases squamous- celled carcinoma super- venes. In others, extensive subepithelial fibrosis results, and the parts present a white and " ironed-out" ap- pearance. This is a. quiescent stage, in which the characteristic intense pruritus disap- pears, while the lia- bility to carcinoma diminishes. The disease is most intractable, the pru- ritus often defying all treatment. Pathologically it is of great interest, as, next to X-ray burns, it affords the best example of a precarcinomatous state. The parts affected are the labia minora, the hood of the clitoris, the inner surface of the labia majora, and sometimes the skin as far back as the anus. The vestibule and vaginal introit escape. Treatment.â€”Of the many applications used for relief of the pruritus, those most likely to succeed are zymocide lotion and resinol ointment, but weak alkaline carbolic lotion (phennate of soda) is also useful. Iodide of mercury ointment may also be tried. These failing, recourse should be had to the X-rays and to zinc-mercury ionization. In the last resort the affected parts must be excised. 1 See a paper by the author and Comyns Berkeley, Proc. Boy. Soc. Med.

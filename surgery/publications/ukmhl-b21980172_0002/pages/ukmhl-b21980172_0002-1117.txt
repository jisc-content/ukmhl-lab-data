1039 MYOMA: PHYSICAL SIGNS Interstitial tumours show apparent rapid growth, largely due to hyper- trophy of the pregnant uterus round them ; the net increase in bulk may suffice to produce pelvic impaction or great abdominal distension. A submucous tumour strongly militates against pregnancy, but if this occurs abortion is probable. A cervical myoma or a pedunculated subperitoneal mass that has gravitated into the pelvis will obstruct labour, and sessile fundal tumours not infrequently, by their weight, retroflex the soft pregnant uterus and cause incarcer- ation. During the lying - in period a " fibroid " may be extruded or may slough out; while pu- erperal sepsis affecting a myomatous uterus grave disaster. Physical signs The physical signs of a myoma vary with its position. Its connexion with the uterus is usually obvious, but pedunculated subperitoneal tumours may appear to be entirely separate. Submu- cous tumours enlarge the organ uniformly, while those out as bosses or Icnobs.

Anterior and posterior cervical myomas displace the cervix backwards or forwards, while those in the broad ligament carry the uterus bodily upwards and towards the opposite side. The palpability of a myomatous uterus from the abdomen depends upon the size and position of the tvmiour. Except in broad- ligament myomas, the swelling is usually central. Cervical myomas, even when large, may not be apparent from above. The abdominal tumour is usually dull on percussion, but that produced by the cervical variety may be partly resonant because the intestines are lifted on the mass. Auscultation may reveal a souffle, especially when the uterus is

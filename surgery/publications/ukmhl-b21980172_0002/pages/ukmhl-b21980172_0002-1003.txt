TORSION OF THE TESTIS 929 and removed, although if the twist is slight and the extravasation of blood not excessive an attempt to save the testis may be made. (b) With imperfectly descended testis (Fig. 563).—In these cases the testis should always be removed, the processus vaginalis se- parated and liga- tured, and the internal abdomi- nal ring closed. Recurring Torsion This term has been given to cases in which the symptoms of torsion occur at varying periods over a course of mouths or years. The symptoms are precisely similar to those of acute torsion, but rarely last longer than twenty-four hours. Atrophy does not necessarily occur, but frequent attacks are, of course, liable to lead to destruction of the organ. Treatment.—The treat- ment in an early case consists of undoing the rotation by manipulation ; sometimes the patient learns to do this him- self. If the condition is really recurring, the testis should be exposed and fixed in the scro- tum by suturing, but if the testis is imperfectly descended it should be removed.

INJURIES OF THE TESTIS CONTUSED WOUNDS These wounds are due to blows or squeezes of the testis, and result in extravasation of blood. The extravasation may occur into the tunica vaginalis (traumatic hoematocele), into the testis (lioematoccio ; 3/2 i .

THE BREAST 20 of a typical carcinoma. Its colour is whitish or yellowish, with a trace of pink, but without the grey tones usually seen in a carcinoma. Small cysts containing clear or brownish fluid are sometimes a pro- minent feature. In some cases these cysts attain exceptional develop ment and cause a considerable increase in the size of the breast. To this condition the name " cystic disease of the breast " has been given, but it differs in no essential respect from chronic mastitis (Fig. 254). Histological changes.—In the hypertrophic form of chronic mastitis the lobules are much increased in size by proliferation of their constituent acini (Fig. 255). Though this is the most im- portant change, it is not the earliest. The epithelial hypertrophy is preceded by changes in the lobular and peri-acinous connective tissue. The lobular connective tissue is swollen and increased in amount, and the connective-tissue slieath of each acinus becomes thickened and unduly cellular, and is the seat of a round- celled infiltration of varying degree. The elastic tissue around the ducts tends to disappear. Later the richly cellular peri- acinous connective tissue undergoes the usual transformation of young fibrous tissue, and changes into characteristic rings of homogeneous fibrous tissue almost free from nuclei. The interlobular tissue also midergoes a fibroid change, and much of the fat disappears. Atrophic chronic mastitis (fibroid breast) appears to be a late stage of the hypertrophic variety. In tliis form. a microscopic section shows dense and old fibrous tissue, poor in nuclei. Em- bedded here and there in the fibrous tissue, islets of fat cells still Fig. 254.—Cystic chronic mastitis (cystic disease of the breast). {From a sj^ecimen in the Middlesex Hospital JMuseum.)

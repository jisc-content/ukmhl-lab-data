RECTAL PROLAPSE rectal mucosa alone protrudes, or complete (Fig. 506), when all the coats of the bowel project. Etiology.—The condition may occur at any age, but is peculiarly frequent at the extremes of life, babies and young children furnishing a large proportion of cases. Normally during defsecation a narrow ring of mucosa protrudes from the anus, and recedes immediately after the completion of the act ; if recession does not immediately occur, prolapse may be said to be present. Any swelling of this ring of mucosa, inflammatory or otherwise, predisposes to prolapse. Such swelling, in babies and young children, may be due to the irritation of worms, but j^robably this Fig. ,505.—Partial prolapse, only Fig. o06.—Complete prolapse, the the mucosa involved. whole thickness of the bowel wall protruded. cause has been much exaggerated. In diarrha-a the mucosa may be swollen, straining is severe and prolonged, and a child suffering from this affection is often allowed to remain seated on the chamber for an indefinite period, thus favouring prolapse. The straining due to phimosis or to vesical calculus is often held responsible, but careful inquiry shows that this alone plays very little, if any, part in the etiology. In adults similar causes may be prevalent, but much more commonly the predisposing cause is a hajmorrhoidal swelling of the mucosa (p. 676). In elderly subjects hasmorrhoids may be present, but at this age the straining and local venous engorgement due to urinary trouble, such as urethral obstruction from enlargement of the prostate, are often responsible. Once partial prolapse is established, it tends to be progressive, unless promptly and efficiently treated. Tlie sphincters become stretched and partly lose tone, thus favouring the increase of the protrusion. Complete prolapse usually results from a neglected partial prolapse,

BILATERAL HARE-LIP 131 continxious with the ala nasi. Tlie deformity is further increased by the presence of a cleft in the alveolus, for in such cases the inner or premaxillary portion of the bone projects forwards in advance of the outer margin of the cleft, and, owing to the loss of its lateral attachment, looks obliquely upwards and towards the unaffected side ; the apex of the nose and the root of the columella are carried with it, and the ala nasi forms a flat and almost tense band of tissue bridging over the upper extremity of the cleft (Fig. 304). Bilateral hare-lip, like the unilateral form, may be partial or complete, but more often the cleft on one side is partial, involving only a portion of the lip, and on tlie opposite side is total, extending Fig. 305.â€”Bilateral complete hare-lip. The profile shows protrusion and upward rotation of the premaxilla. through the whole depth of the lip, and generally through the alveolus and the hard and soft palates as well. When the clefts are total on both sides and extend to the bone, the premaxilla or os incisivum, no longer kept in position by its lateral attachments to the hard palate, is pushed forwards and upwards by excessive growth of that part of the nasal septum formed from the premaxillary process, and in severe cases projects beyond the tip of the nose, giving the child the characteristic prognathous appearance (Fig. 305). Frequently the pedicle by which the premaxilla is attached to the nasal septum is so narrow that considerable lateral movement of the process is permitted. Tlie skin and subcutaneous tissue corresponding to the median por- tion (philtrum) of the upper lip is smaller than usual and possesses no lower free margin, being firmly attached to the subjacent bone, and

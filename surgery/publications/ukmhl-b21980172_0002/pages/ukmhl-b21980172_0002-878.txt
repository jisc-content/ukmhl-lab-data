8io THE KIDNEY The symptoms of pyonephrosis are pain, tenderness, swelling, and pyuria. The pain is constant, heavy and boring in character, and tenderness is pronounced at first. There may be severe colic and also flexion of the thigh. The tumour has the characteristics of a renal tumour, and is large, firm, smooth, and non-fluctuating. Pyuria is the cardinal symptom. It forms an abun- dant thick, heavy deposit, subject to pronounced varia- tions in quantity. There are recurrent attacks of complete retention of pus, during which the urine becomes clear, the tumour larger, more tender, painful and tense, and the tempera- ture rises. On cystoscopy, cystitis is usually found, and the ori- fice of the ureter is seen to be open, round, and immo- bile, and to have thick and in some instances cedema- tous or ulcerated margins. In a closed pyo- nephrosis an efflux is absent; in an open pyonephrosis it consists of semi-solid pus, watery pus, or purulent urine. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of a closed pyonephrosis depends upon the history of pyuria, and the presence of a renal tumour with symptoms of septic absorption. If pyuria is present, tliis and cystoscopy will lead to a diagnosis. Large intermittent discharges of pus in the urine are found in three conditions, viz. pyonephrosis, a suppurating vesical diverticulum 538.—Calculous pyonephrosis with dilatation of ureter.

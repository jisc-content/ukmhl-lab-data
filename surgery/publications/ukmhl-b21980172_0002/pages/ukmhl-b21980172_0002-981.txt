907 THE MALE GENITAL TRACT By RUSSELL HOWARD, M.S., F.R.C.S. THE PROSTATE Anatomy.—The prostate is a glandular organ shaped like a chest- nut and weighing from 15 to 20 grm. It surrounds the first part of the urethra, the base of the bladder rests on it, and it is situated between the symphysis pubis and the rectum. The anterior aspect of the gland is attached to the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis by specialized bands of the anterior fibres of the recto- vesical fascia forming the pubo-prostatic or anterior true ligaments of the blad- der, while the lateral as- pects are covered with a reflection from the recto- vesical fascia under which a large plexus of veins (the plexus of Santorini) is found. The posterior aspect is attached to the rectum by dense fibrous connective tissue in which no large vessels are found. Many of the fibres of the levator ani muscle end on tlie prostate, whicli thus lies outside the pelvis but in the tissue that forms tlie pelvic diaphragm. The prostatic urethra is IJ in. long, ci-escentic on section, and pene- trates the prostate in such a way that a large segment of the gland lies below and a small one above it. Tlie common ejaculatory ducts pierce the prostate, and, like the sinus nocularis and prostatic glands, open into the prostatic urethra. The arteries of the prostate are derived from the interior vesical artery; and the veins, which form a large plexus round the gland, enter the dorsal vein of the penis and the veins of the urethra.

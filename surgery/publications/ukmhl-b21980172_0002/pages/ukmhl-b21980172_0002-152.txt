124 FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE Development of the palate—If the interior of the oro- nasal cavity be examined in a fcstus of seven weeks (Fig. 297), the olfactory chambers will be seen opening into it, by the primitive choange, between the maxillary processes and the shelf-like projection from the posterior part of the mesial nasal (globular) process in which the premaxilla is developed. Laterally, two horizontal plates will be noticed springing from the inner aspect of the maxillary processes. These, the palatal plates, grow inwards beneath the nasal septum, mid brain cerebral uesicle anterior nares upper lip. mes. nas. proc. eye premax. mes. nas. proc. upper lip. max. proc. alueolus max. proc. palat. proc. max. proc.

From this it will be understood that partial cleft palate is due to defective fusion of the palatal processes with each other ; that complete cleft palate follows non-union of a palatal plate with the premaxillary process in front and the opposite palatal plate behind ; and that, in complete cleft palate and hare-lip, the line of cleavage passes between the maxillary and palatine pro- cesses externally, and the globular, premaxillary, and palatine processes mesially. As the process of fusion spreads from before backwards, partial cleft palate occurs with greater frequency than complete cleft palate, and a complete cleft is not always accom- panied by hare-lip. Similarly, partial or complete hare-lip is not

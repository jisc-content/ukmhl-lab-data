THE UTERUS 1046 assumes a polypoid form. The symptoms are those of haemorrhage and pain, and the only possible treatment is wide removal, preferably by Wertheim's method (see p. 1024), UTERINE POLYPS Symptoms.—Five varieties of uterine polyps are found. 1. Adenomatous and cystic polyps {mucous polyps).—The structure of the growth is similar to that of those occurring in the cervix (see p. 1017), except that the glands are tubular, not race- mose (Fig. 606). The early symptom is menorrliagia and irregular loss, which later, as the growth extrudes, becomes continuous. 2. Myomatous polyps.—The symp- toms are those of a submucous my- oma, as described at p. 1036. The loss is more strictly periodic than that associated with mucous polyps, the tumour having little vascularity. 3. Placental polyps.—Occasionally a portion of the gestation pro- ducts after abortion or labour remains adherent to the uterine wall and becomes partially organized. Such pedunculated masses occasion more or less continuous loss, dating from the termination of the pregnancy. 4. Malignant polyps.—Sarcoma is the only form of malignant growth that commonly becomes actually polypous. The symptoms of these growths have been dealt with already (p. 1045). Diagnosis.—So long as the polyp is contained entirely within the corpus, its presence can only be discovered after dilating the cervix. It may be suspected, however, when with bleeding and some uterine enlargement the cervical canal is found unnaturally patent. Treatment—The cervix having been dilated, the polyp should Fig. 60G.—Adenomatous mucous polyp, the in- flammatory stroma containing elongated hyper- trophic glands.

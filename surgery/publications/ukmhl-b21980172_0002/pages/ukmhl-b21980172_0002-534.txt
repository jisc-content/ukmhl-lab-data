THE INTESTINES 488 ileo-csecal region is to be explained by the anatomical and physiological arrangements of this part of the bowel, the last few inches of the ileum acting as a detrusor muscle to pass the intestinal contents through the ileo-cohc sphincter, and being studded over with numerous Peyer's patches, which are liable to become inflamed and swollen. The greater size of the lumen of the colon as compared with the ileum, and the length and looseness of the meso- colon of the infant, also favour the folding of the receiving layer over the intussusceptum. Morbid anatomy. — As the intussusceptum increases in length, the mesentery is dragged in between the entering and returning tubes, and the tension exerted through the mesentery causes the intussuscep- tion to become curved with its concavity towards the mesenteric attachment. At the same time, the whole intussusception is drawn back towards the promontory of the sa- crum where the mesentery is at- tached, and swings round in the direction of the hands of a watch till it may reach the left iUac fossa. In this process the mesentery is compressed, twisted, and stretched to such an extent that the vascular supply of the bowel is interfered with. At first the venous return is impeded, leading to engorgement and swelling of the invaginated bowel. As the congestion increases, blood is extravasated into the coats of the bowel, and an excess of mucus mixed with blood oozes from the mucous surfaces and is passed by the rectum. The effects of the congestion are most marked in the returning tube, and towards the apex of the intussusception, which may become swollen into a knob, and this, together with adhesions formed between Fig. 418.—Adenoma of small in testine causing intussusception.

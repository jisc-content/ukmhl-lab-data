ACUTE APPENDICITIS 545 that the cHiiical course may conveniently be described under three headings :— 1. Acute or subacute attacks, without perforation or gangrene, and associated with a mild and local peritonitis in the immediate neighbourhood of the appendix. 2. Acute attacks associated with ulceration, perforation, or gangrene, resulting in the formation of a localized abscess around the appendix. Fig. 436.—Perforation of the appendix by a pin. {S/yctinu-u logSn, St. TJioiuas\< /fos/>iial Miisciiui.) 3. Acute attacks associated with the passage of virulent bacteria from the inflamed appendix into the peritoneal cavity, either with or without gross perforation or gangrene, and resulting in a diffuse, spreading peritonitis. For the sake of brevity these may respectively be termed—(1) acute appendicitis, (2) appendicitis mth local abscess, and (3) appen- dicitis with diffuse peritonitis. 1. ACUTE APPENDICITIS Symptoms.—The attack may be sudden and unexpected, or it mav be preceded by certain svmptoms which are termed prodromal.

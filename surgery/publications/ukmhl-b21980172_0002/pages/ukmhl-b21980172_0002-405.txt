DUODENAL ULCER: PERFORATIOiN 367 Symptoms.—A few years ago it was thought that duodenal ulcer was often latent, and that the first symptom was in many cases per- foration. Now that the symptoms of duodenal ulcer are better known, it is recognized that in most cases symptoms have been present for years, and that the ulcer which has perfo- rated is a chronic one. Thus, in 14 out of 15 cases recorded by Mitchell, a his- tory of previous " dyspepsia " was present, in the majority of the cases, typical of chronic ulcer. I have found the same in most of the cases of perforation in which I made careful inquiries ; the last four occurred while the patient was under me- dical treatment. The perforation may be acute, subacute, or chronic. It is much more frequently subacute than in gastric ulcer, and consequently the symptoms may not be so definite as those of a per- forated gastric ulcer. If the ulcer is situated close to the pylorus, and the opening is a large one, there is a sudden escape of gastric contents, causing severe epi- gastric pain, followed by ab- dominal rigidity, with the same absence of early severe shock as in perforation of a gastric ulcer. But if the perforation is a small one, or is situated at the junction of the first and second parts of the duodenum, or in the second part, the escaped fluid may track down into the right Icidney pouch. Maynard Smith has experimentally investigated the course taken by fluids escaping from the duodenum, with results corresponding to those found clinically. The fluid in every case ran down and collected in the right kidney Fig. 380.—Perforation of an acute ulcer situated on the anterior wall of the first part of the duodenum.

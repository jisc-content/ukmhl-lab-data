DERMOID CYSTS OF THE TONGUE 195 service ; and it may be stated generally that the oral and lingual manifestations of syjshiUs are rapidly benefited by a course of salvarsan. CYSTS AND TUMOURS DERMOID CYSTS The group of cystic tumours in the tongue to which the term dermoid may be applied consists of three main varieties, depending upon the particular developmental irregularity responsible for their formation. In this consideration we must take into account the changes which occur in the developing neck. In the middle line of the neck, where the lateral folds meet one another in the process of fusion, portions of the epidermis may become unnaturally included in the underlying mesoblast, and may later develop into the type of cyst called by Fig. 336.—Branchial arches and cleft. I, External cleft depression ; 2, internal clelt depression ; 3, cleft membrane. Bland-Sutton sequestration dermoid ; such dermoids may be met with embedded in the substance of the tongue. Again, if the process of obUteration of the branchial depressions by the opercular folds of the cervical sinus be imperfectly carried out, embryonic remains may later develop into cystic tumours. Between each branchial bar and the next there is a depression or cleft recess, limited by the cleft membrane—the outer part, or external cleft depression, being Uned by epiblast; the inner, or internal cleft depres- sion, by hypoblast (Fig. 336). Dermoid cysts arising in connexion with the external cleft depression present all the usual characteristics of a dermoid cyst, being filled with pultaceous sebaceous matter and having typically epidermal walls, upon which hairs may be found. Cysts arising from the inner cleft depression, markedly rare, appear rather in the form of pharyngeal diverticula, or more rarely as cystic

362 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM Situation.—Ulcers occur most often in the supra-ampullary portion of the duodenum, over 95 per cent, being found within an inch of the pylorus. The ulcer is usually solitary, and situated on the upper and anterior wall; next in order of frequency, on the posterior wall. An ulcer in this latter situation is particularly liable to be associated with haemorrhage, which may prove rapidly fatal from erosion of the pancreatico-duodenal artery Fig. 379.—Chronic ulcer on the posterior wall, with acute perforated ulcer on the anterior surface. Duodenum opened from below. {London Hospital Pathological Institute.) (Fig. 378). Occasionally two ulcers are present on opposite sides of the intestine—contact ulcers (see Fig. 379). The morbid anatomy of duodenal ulcer resembles that of gastric ulcer, with which it may coexist. Symptoms.—A chronic duodenal ulcer may be latent until perforation occurs. In the majority of patients, however, it gives rise to a definite train of symptoms. In a few cases it cannot be distinguished from a gastric ulcer, and in still fewer the diagnosis of peptic ulcer is not made at all.

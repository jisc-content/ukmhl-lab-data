OPERATIONS FOR CLEFT PALATE i6i After-treatment.â€”The mouth should be sprayed daily with a mild antiseptic and alkaline lotion, but no attempt should be made to inspect the wound lest the child struggle and cry. Liquid nourish- ment in small quantities at a time should be given with a spoon for the first week, after which the amount may be increased. A baby must be nursed and soothed to prevent it from crying, and an older child must be forbidden to talk. The stitches should not be removed until the tenth day, and during the process it is always advisable to make the child drowsy with an anajsthetie. No matter how perfect the cosmetic result, no operation for cleft palate can be called successful unless the speech be improved. Consequently it behoves the surgeon to urge the necessity of lessons in elocution by a competent teacher as soon as possible, for without such lessons many patients will be unintelligible and few will articulate clearly. In some the result of careful training is so excellent that the ordinary observer would not suspect the presence of a congenital defect. It is always advisable to see the patient some three months after the operation ; if then the soft palate appears unduly tense, increased flexibility and a corre- sponding improvement in the speech will be obtained by teaching the mother or the nurse to massage and exert pressure upon it with the finger.

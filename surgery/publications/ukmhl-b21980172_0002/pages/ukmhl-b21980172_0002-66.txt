THE BREAST 44 that areas of de&iite fluctuation, corresponding to the cysts, may sometimes be felt. Diagnosis.—A large tumour of the breast presenting fluctuat- ing areas may be a cystic fibro-adenoma, a cystic duct papilloma, or a cystic sarcoma. The history or presence of serous discharge from the nipple distinguishes duct papilloma, while signs of infil- tration will lead to the diagnosis of sarcoma. Treatment. — The treatment is that of soft fibro-adenoma, and the prognosis is good. FuNGATiNG Cystic Fibro- adenoma (FUNGATING Cystadenoma) In very rare cases of cystic fibro-adenoma the skin over the cystic portion of the tumour becomes tliinned and gives way. Serous fluid escapes, and blunt lobulated and fohated masses of fibro-adenomatous tissue project through the opening {see Fig. 264). Septic and inflammatory changes may occur in the pro- truding mass, wliich becomes swollen and congested, and bleeds readily. In such cir- cumstances the simulation of a fungating sarcoma is very close, though the tumour is really innocent. In these days of early treatment of breast tu- mours this condition is rarely seen. Diagnosis.—A wedge of the protruding mass, | in. in depth, should be removed for microscopical examination. No anaes- thetic will be necessary. Treatment is that of soft fibro-adenoma. PUEE ADENOMA 1 In a pure adenoma the tumour is almost entirely composed of epithehal tubes more or less closely simulating normal acini, and separated by a minimal amount of supporting fibrous tissue, in 1 See also Vol. I., p. 431. Fig. 264.—Fungating cystic adenoma of the breast. The edges of the skin are rolled back, not thinned and infiltrated as in sarcoma, and a mass of fibro-adenomatous tissue is protruding.

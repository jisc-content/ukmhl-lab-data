RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL 662 anterior ones being almost horizontal and the posterior ones nearly vertical—• to be inserted into the central point of the perineum and into the wall of the anal canal, blending with the external sphincter, while behind the anus the two muscles meet in a median raphe between the anus and the coccyx, and the most posterior fibres are attached to the lower sacral and coccygeal vertebrae (Fig. 481). The upper surface is separated by the pelvic fascia from the prostate, or vagina, and the rectum ; the inferior surface, covered by the anal fascia, bounds the ischio-rectal fossa. It is supplied by the Fig. 48L—The ischio-rectal fossae. The attachment of the external sphincter muscle to the coccyx has been removed. I.T., Ischial tuberosity; S.S.L., great sacro-sciatic ligament ; T.P., transverse perineal muscle ; E.s. external sphincter muscle ; L.A., levator ani muscle ; F. (on the right side), the fascia covering the obturator internus muscle ; F. (on the left side), the cut edge of the fascia which has been removed, showing o.i., the obturator internus muscle perineal branch of the pudic nerve, and by the 3rd and 4th sacral nerves on its pelvic aspect. The fibres of the leva tores ani passing from the back of the os pubis to meet behind the anus will, when contracted, firmly grip the anal canal, reducing it to an antero-posterior slit. These fibres of the levatores, there- fore, form a sphincter to the anal canal, and can often be detected by digital examination per rectum. The coccygeus is attached to the ischial spine, the adjacent pelvic fascia and the side of the coccyx. It is in contact anteriorly with the levator ani.

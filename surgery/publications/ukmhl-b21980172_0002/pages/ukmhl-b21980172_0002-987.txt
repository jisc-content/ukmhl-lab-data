913 CHRONIC ENLARGEMENT a steadily enlarging postprostatic pouch behind the enlarged middle lobe. (Fig. 559.) (c) Effects on ureters and kidneys—The effects on these structures are similar to those following other causes of urethral obstruc- tion, e.g. stricture. The lumen of the ureter becomes dilated, and its muscular coat atrophied, till the tube may reach the size of a piece of small intestine. The pelvis of the kidney becomes dilated, and there is an interstitial fibrosis of the kidney which de- stroys the secre- tory tubules and leads to renal in- sufficiency. (d) I n fl a nn- matory effects. —Sooner or later a cystitis de- velops, either from direct infec- tion by instru- mentation or by infection from the bowel, and there will follow ureter- itis, pyelitis, and pyelonephritis. ((') E ff e c t s on the circula- tion. — The veins of the peripros- tatic plexus, with which the dorsal veins of the penis commmiicate, become dilated and varicose. Eupture of one of these may even lead to profuse haematuria. (f) Effects on the sexual organs.—The common ejaculatory ducts which pass through the prostate may be distorted and com- pressed so that semen can no longer pass along them. This will lead to dilatation of the vesiculse seminales and to aspermia. 3^ Fig. 559.—Bladder laid open, showing the obstruc- tion caused by enlargement of the prostate. A bristle is seen in each ureter and a stylet in the urethra.

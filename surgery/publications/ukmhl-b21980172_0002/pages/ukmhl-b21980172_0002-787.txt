THE LIVER, GALL-BLADDER, BILE PASSAGES, AND PANCREAS By G. grey turner, M.S.Durh., F.R.C.S.Eng. Anatomy of the liver and of the biliary apparatus. ■—The liver measures a little more than 6 in. in the greatest verti- cal direction, and a little less than 6 in. antero-posteriorly. Its summit reaches to the upper border of the right 5th rib at a point 1 in. internal to the mammary line, and, therefore, is not directly accessible without traversing the pleura, limg, and diaphragm. Some part of each of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th ribs lies over Fig. 518.—Transverse section of the peritoneal cavity at level of foramen of Winslow. the liver, as well as the cartilages from the 6th to the 9th, while the pleura extends to within 2 in. of the costal margin. The peritoneal space just below the liver—the hepatic pouch (Fig. 518)—is important, for here collections may form when the gall-bladder leaks. The gall-bladder (Fig. 519) is usually pear-shaped, and has a capacity ■of ItV oz. At its junction with the cystic duct there is often a lateral pouching called the pelvis, or Hartmann's pouch, which, when distended, may be mistaken for the commencement of the cystic duct. The cystic duct is about 1-| in. in length and runs downwards and to the left to join the common hepatic duct. Its lumen, normally only in. in SPLEEM LICNO-REMCIL LiCRMEMT LEFT KIDNEY

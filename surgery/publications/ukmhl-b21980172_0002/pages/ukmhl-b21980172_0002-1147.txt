1069 OVARIAN CYSTS The multiloGular cyst-embryoma is much rarer. It consists in large part of solid masses intermixed with cavities of different sizes, whose contents vary from typical dermoid material to mucus and clear serum. Those containing fat are lined with a perfect skin, coated with vernix caseosa like that of a new-born infant. Others present a mucous membrane exactly similar to that of normal bowel; whilst in some, columnar ciliated epithelium is found like that of the trachea. Micro- scopically, every variety of tissue characterizing the human body is found in irregular arrangement (Fig. 620), and in exceptional ex- amples well-formed portions of the lower part of a foetus may be pre- sent. It is a remark- able fact that endo- genous teratomas, whether occurring in the ovary or elsewhere, rarely de- velop before puber- ty, the commonest age at which they are met with being between 20 and 30. 2. Cysts of the ovarian hilum {p ar 0 0 phor o ni G cysts). — The cysts ;Fig. 616.—Ovarian cyst-adenoma, the loculi lined that occasionally ' with a tall columnar muciniferous epithelium, develop in the hilum of the ovary are probably derived from those remnants of the mesonephric tubules known as the paroophoron and from some of the earlier ingrowths of the germinal epithelium (rete cords). They may be unilocular or multilocular ; they grow into the ovary, which lies on their posterior surface, and burrow into the broad ligament in front. They are particularly prone to develop intracystic papillomas, in virtue of which they become more or less malignant {see Papuliferous Cysts, p. 1072). They are commonest between the ages of 30 and 50. 3. Broad-ligament cysts.—A cyst growing in the broad ligament is covered by its peritoneal layers, and as it invades the meso- salpinx has the tube stretched across it (Fig. 621). These features are characteristic. Cysts developing in the outer third of the meso- salpinx are pedunculated; but those arising in any other position

482 THE INTESTINES 3. A Meckel's diverticulum may cause obstruction by acting as a band (Pig. 401, p. 445). 4. Bands formed by anatomical structures abnormally attached.— Among anatomical structures which may act as bands and so cause obstruction may be mentioned the vermiform appendix, which may become attached to the right ovary, to the uterus, to an adjacent portion of mesentery (Fig. 412), or to the anterior abdominal wall. The Fallopian , tube (Plate 93), or / even an enlarged ( appendix epiploica, may act in a similar manner. I have operated on one case in which the pedicle of a fibroid of the uterus en- snared a coil of small intestine and caused obstruction, and on another in which the pedicle of an ovarian cyst was the cause of obstruction. Strangulation through abnor- mal apertures.— In the majority of cases of obstruction due to this cause, the small intestine is prolapsed through an abnormal aperture in the mesentery of the lower ileum. Such apertures may be congenital, but are usually the result of a previous injury, the mesentery having been torn by a kick or crush of the abdomen, or divided in the course of an operation and not united again. In course of time the edges of the rent become smooth, rounded, and unyielding, and a ring or sht is formed into which a knuckle of bowel may at any time slip. Similar apertures may be met with in the great omentum, and less frequently in the mesentery of the transverse and descending colon. Shts are sometimes formed by stretched adhesions resulting from peritonitis, particularly in relation to the female pelvic organs. Clinical features.—The sjTnptoms are usually those of the Fig. 411.—Strangulation of small intestine in a child by a cord-like band stretching between the vermiform appendix and a coil of small intestine. {Autlior's case)

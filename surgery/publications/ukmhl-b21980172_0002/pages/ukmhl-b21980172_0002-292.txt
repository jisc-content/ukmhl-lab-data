THE CESOPHAGUS 258 placed behind the patient, who is directed to swallow the prepared bismuth ; the shadow formed by this substance as it passes down the oesophagus can be easily seen. If a stricture be present, the bismuth collects at its site and may form a dark mass of considerable size which reproduces the shape of the CBsophagus at the site of the constriction. If the existence of a pouch be suspected the patient is directed to take some bread - and - milk or mashed potatoes with which the bismuth salts are mixed.' 6. Direct ex- amination—By the employment of the oesophagoscope a direct examina- tion of the interior of the oesophagus can be undertaken. Foreign bodies can be seen, and their nature, shape, and position be de- termined ; morbid growths and ulcer- ations can also be investigated. The instrument devised by Killian and modified by Briin- ing has many ad- vantages. Its essential parts are shown in Fig. 347. The important features of this in- strument are the ingenious method of illumination and the ease with which an instrument can be manipulated within the tube. CEsophagoscopy may be performed under either local or general anaesthesia. As a rule it is far better to employ a general anaesthetic ; the examination may take some time, and the necessarily constrained position, with the head extended, is very trying to the patient. 1 See also Vol. I., p. 648.

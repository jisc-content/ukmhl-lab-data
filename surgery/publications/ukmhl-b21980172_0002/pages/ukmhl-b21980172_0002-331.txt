295 BIBLIOGRAPHY EXTRINSIC CAUSES OF OBSTRUCTION In any part of its course the oesophagus may be pressed upon or invaded by a tumour or swelhng arising in neighbouring tissues. Such obstruction may be due to aneurysm, enlarged glands, new growths, or abscess, and is more apt to occur within the thorax than in the neck. An example of obstruction caused by a mediastinal new growth is seen in Pig. 3G0. For a description of extrinsic forms of obstruction the reader must be referred to other parts of this System or to text- books of Medicine.

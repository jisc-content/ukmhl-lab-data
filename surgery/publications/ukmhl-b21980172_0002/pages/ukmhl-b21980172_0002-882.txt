8i4 THE KIDNEY by calculi, tumours, foreign bodies, blood-clot; (c) pressure from without by tumours, fibrous bands (Fig. 539), purulent collections, an aberrant renal vessel (Fig. 540) ; (d) kinking of the ureter from undue mobility of the kidney ; (e) torsion of the ureter. Urethral obstruction may be caused by a congenital fold or dia- phragm or obliteration, or more frequently by stricture and enlarged prostate. Congenital hydronephrosis occurs before or soon after birth, and when unilateral may be due to valves or folds in or stenosis of the duct, or to bending or kinking of a ureter misplaced in the bladder, urethra, ejaculatory duct, seminal vesicle, vas deferens, or vagina. j^^H^^ More frequently congenital hydro- ^^^V , ^ -j i nephrosis is bilateral, and is due - ^^^w -'^ . iJ to urethral obstruction caused by a septum or imperforate portion, a cyst, torsion of the penis, or phimosis. In some cases no obstruction can be found, but the bladder, ureters, and kidneys are greatly dilated. In these cases there may be dilatation of the colon, and the condition is probably due to changes in the sympathetic nervous system. Pathology. •— Hydronephrosis is said to be due to the persis- tence of folds of the mucosa and muscle found in the foetal ureter, and to twisting that occurs during development from the Wolffian duct. Hydronephrosis due to abnor- mal vessels passing to the lower pole in front of or behind the ureter may cause obstruction by pressure upon that duct. Hydronephrosis due to movable kidney is intermittent, and is the result of kinking of the ureter. It is also held that the mobility may be consequent upon the increased size of the kidney already hydronephrotic. Adhesions between the colon and the pelvis resulting from chronic constipation may be the cause of hydronephrosis. Fig. 539.—Hydronephrosis due to bands of adhesion between ureter and renal pelvis.

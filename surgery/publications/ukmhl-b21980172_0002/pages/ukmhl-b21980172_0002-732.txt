RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL 6/6 the columns of Morgagni; in the early stage internal piles are merely enlargements of these columns (Fig. 492), and appear as longitudinal sessile folds of mucous membrane. Later they increase and become more globular, or rarely pedunculated. Entering the upper level of the tumour is an artery, the terminal branch of the superior hsemorrhoidal artery. Occasionally, several arteries enter the pile, the latter being then so vascular as to deserve the name arterial pile. Sometimes, as the result of periplilebitis, the blood in the dilated veins coagulates, and organization of the clot may occur, with the result that the pile is reduced to a small fibrous mass.

M., column of Morgagni; s., sinus of Morgagni; v., anal valve ; I.H., internal haemorrhoids, in the early stage, showing the pile to be an enlargement of the column of Morgagni. Symptoms.—Some discomfort and a feeling of incomplete empty- ing of the bowel may be experienced, but true pain is not present unless some complication occurs. Bleeding is the common symptom. At first it happens only during defsecation, either at every act, or it may be at intervals of days, weeks, or months. Later, haemorrhage may occur at other times, e.g. during active exercise. The amount of blood lost varies between a few drops only at the end of defsecation and a continuous loss sufficient to induce grave anaemia in a few weeks. The source of the blood is an abrasion on the mucosa. As internal haemorrhoids increase in size they tend to frolapse through the anus. This protrusion differs from that of a pedunculated growth which is thrust bodily through the orifice. The pile, being

CHRONIC MASTITIS 21 ft r remain. The lobules (groups of acini) which have escaped destruction are small, few in number, and widely scattered. The epithelium of the acini is far advanced in degeneration, and may be represented by a few shrunken cells, often lacking a central lumen, or merely by a little mass of debris (Figs. 256, 257). Symptoms.—Many women present some degree of chronic mas- titis without any corre- sponding symptoms. In other cases, however, pain is a jrjrominent symptom—usually a dull ache, but occasionally very severe, lancinating or neuralgic in charac- ter, and very intractable. The pain may be worse, and the swelling more marked, during the men- strual periods. It is often aggravated by movements, and espe- cially by the prolonged use of the arm or by jolting movements such as descending stairs. Discharge from the nipple. — The frequent presence of tense cysts in chronic mastitis shows that there is considerable se- cretory pressure within the gland. It is, there- fore, not surprising that a serous discharge from the nipple appears in certain cases in which obstruction of the ducts is incomplete. The discharge may be made to flow by pressure upon the affected portion of the gland. It Fig. 255.—Hypertrophic mastitis. Note the J increase in size of the lobules. At the lower margin of the figure the edge of an infiltrating carcinoma can be seen—a condition into which hyper- trophic mastitis may readily pass.

THE FALLOPIAN TUBE 1048 Tubo-ovarian abscess.—An acute pyosalpinx is frequently com- plicated by one or more follicular abscesses of the ovary on tbe same side. Occasionally the cavity of the pyosalpinx communicates with the cavity of the ovarian abscess, a retort-shaped swelling being formed which tends to burrow in the broad ligament. (Fig. 608.) 2. Acute non-supfurative sal- pingitis.—In less severe infec- tions, suppuration may not occur. In such cases the tube, if distended, contains a serous fluid, often turbid and discoloured [acute hydrosalpinx). Occasion- ally, considerable hsemorrhage occurs into the tube lumen. The result is a hydro-hsemato- salpinx {acute Jiceniorrhagic sal- pingitis). In other respects the anatomy of the diseased tube is the same in non- suppurative as in suppurative salpingitis ; but so long as sup- puration has not occurred, spontaneous resolution is possible. Chronic salpingitis Chronic salpingitis is usually the sequel of the acute variety, but occasionally cases are met with in which no history of the latter is forthcoming. Some of these are due to tubercu- lous disease. Three conditions may be en- countered-—(1) chronic pyosalpinx, (2) chronic hydrosalpinx, (3) chronic iibrotic salpingitis. 1. Chronic pyosalpinx.—An old pyosalpinx which has become densely adherent to the adjacent parts, together with the thickened mesosalpinx and infiltrated omen- tum, forms a conglomerate mass of which the distended tube forms only a part. The ovary, surrounded by adhesions and affected with peripheral sclerosis, often becomes the seat of multiple follicular cysts which in time may totally destroy the organ.

VOLVULUS OF PELVIC COLON 497 liable to recur from time to time if the pelvic colon becomes over- loaded. Treatment.—When there is reason to suspect the presence of a volvulus within a few hours of the onset of obstructive symptoms, with the patient in the knee-elbow position a long rectal tube may be passed into the colon to withdraw gas and fluid. If tliis is not imme- diately successful, it need not be repeated, and no time should be lost in opening the abdomen. The incision should be large enough to Fig. 4-21.—Volvulus of pelvic colon backwards. (Semi-diagrammatic.j admit of free access to the distended coil, and even of its being brought out of the abdomen. After the abdomen has been opened, it may be possible, with one hand inside, to guide a rectal tube past the twist and so empty the distended loop of gas and fluid faeces. If successful, this greatly simpliiies the further manipulations ; if it fails, the loop must be opened and the twist undone. If the gut is viable, the opening may be closed and the loop returned to the abdomen after any adhesions that may be present have been dealt with. It is probably safer, however, to utiHze the opening as an artificial anus till the patient has got over the immediate effects of the obstruction.

HOUR-GLASS STOMACH 323 loiown surgeons, among whom are Bier, Czerny, and Hartmann, have fallen into this error, and recorded their experience for the sake of others. It may also become the seat of a volvulus. Symptoms.—These resemble very closely those of pyloric stenosis and follow in many cases on the history of a gastric ulcer. The physical signs may render a diagnosis possible before operation. These depend upon—(1) inflating the stomach; (2) the introduction of fluid ; (3) examination by X-rays after a bismuth meal. Fig. 370. —Hour-glass stomach from malignant growth. A portion of the cardiac pouch has been removed. {London Hospital Museum.') 1. On inflating with CO2 or air, the upper pouch may be seen to become dilated, and this is followed, if the abdomen be watched for a few minutes, by the pyloric pouch. 2. If a measured quantity of liquid has been passed into the stomach through a tube, a large portion of it cannot be recovered. Moreover, during lavage, after the fluid has returned clear there may be a gush of cloudy fluid with gastric contents. It may be impossible to obtain any fluid even when splashing occurs, the fluid having passed into the pyloric pouch (sign of para- doxical dilatation). On passing in a quantity of fluid the cardiac pouch may become distended first; this gradually subsides, to be followed by another swelling due to fluid in the pyloric pouch. 3. X-ray examination after a bismuth meal should be carried out in all suspected cases, and is the onlv reliable means of diagnosis (Fig- 364).

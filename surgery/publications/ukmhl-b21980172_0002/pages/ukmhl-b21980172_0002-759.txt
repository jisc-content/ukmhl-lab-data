ULCERATION 701 The ulceration m some cases extends to the pelvic colon, and over this viscus pain may be experienced and tenderness elicited. The pelvic and iliac colons may be felt as thickened cylinders. Plastic peritonitis is commonly present, and localized suppuration or diffuse peritonitis may occur eitlier from perforation of an ulcer or migration of the bacteria through tlie unhealthy bowel wcM. On examination with the sigmoidoscope the diagnosis is easy, but the cause of the ulcera- tion often remains un- determined. The sig- moidoscope may fail to demonstrate the upper limit of the disease, either because its pas- sage is prevented by a stricture or because its length is insufficient. In such cases the extent of bowel involvement can only be decided by ab- dominal exploration. Treatment of ulceration of the rectum and anal canal. — This depends to a slight extent upon the cause, but far more upon the situation and extent, of the ulceration. If it be due to a specific organism, the recognized treatment of this, either by drugs or by vaccines, is indicated. Such cases form a small minority, for when cases arc first seen the ulceration has become chronic, and is in great part dependent upon the common pyogenetic bacteria ; the infection is a mixed one, and vaccines are probably useless. In all cases absolute rest in bed is essential, the diet should be very light and calculated to leave the smallest possible residue, and the bowels should be carefully regulated by aperients to prevent accumulation of faecal material in tlie rectum.

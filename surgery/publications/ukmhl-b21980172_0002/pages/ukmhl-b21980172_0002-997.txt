VESICULITIS 923 prostate. The symptoms and treatment are dealt with under Gonorrhoeal Spermato-Cystitis, Vol. I., p. 843. CHRONIC VESICULITIS (SPERMATO-CYSTITIS) Chronic vesiculitis may be gonorrhoeal, septic, or tubercular. The first two may be considered together. Chronic Septic or Gonoerhceal Vesiculitis This condition usually follows a urethritis of a similar nature, and is not infrequently preceded by an acute attack. Symptoms.—There is a feel- ing of weight and pain in the perineum, and frequently also a chronic urethral discharge which on endoscopic examination is foimd to come from the ejacula- tory ducts. There may be fre- quency and pain on micturition, and sexual irritability, leading at first to increased sexual desire and power, and later to diminu- tion of the sexual appetite and to impotence. On rectal exami- nation the vesiculge are foimd to be enlarged and painful, and pus can frequently be squeezed from them into the urethra. Chronic urethritis and prostatitis are often concomitants. Treatment—The only rational treatment for tliis condition, besides the administration of urinary antiseptics, is the emptying of the vesiculse of their abnormal contents by digital manipulation. The vesiculse are stroked from above downwards, their contents being squeezed into the urethra. This is repeated daily until relief of all symptoms is obtained ; but the condition is very rebellious to treatment. In old-standing cases it may be justifiable to remove the vesiculse through a perineal incision. Tuberculous Vesiculitis (Fig. 561) Tuberculous vesiculitis is usually associated with tuberculous disease in other parts of the genito-urinary tract, especially in the epididymis and the prostate. It has, however, been stated that primary disease is not uncommon, and that the tuberculous disease of tlie epididymis is secondary to vesiculitis.

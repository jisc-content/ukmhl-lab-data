FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE 122 the same week, five processes—one mesial (tlie fronto-nasal) and four lateral (the two maxillary and the two mandibular)—bud out from the base of the primitive cerebral capsule around the margins of the- stomodaeum, and, by their growth and ultimate coalescence, enclose the cavity, which is now termed the oro-nasal cavity, and complete the facial portion of the head at the end of the second month (Fig. 295). The mesial or fronto-nasal process which bounds the upper part of the oro-nasal cavity becomes elevated on either side of the mid- line to form two marked protuberances, the globular processes. MHDIBUiyllt Fig. 295.—Face of an embryo of 8 mm. (After His and McMu -rich.) Simultaneously with the formation of the globular processes, two- oval depressions or grooves, the nasal pits, appear externally to them, and thus separate the lower end of the fronto-nasal process into three parts—a mesial nasal process with its globular processes, and two lateral nasal processes. These processes are in reality the anterior extremities of three vertical septa that grow down from the base of the primitive cerebral capsule ; they are kept apart by the gradual deepening of the nasal pits, and ultimately form the septal and lateral walls of the nasal cavities; The portion of the mesial nasal process which intervenes between the two globular processes is divided into an upper triangular and a lower quadrilateral area by a transverse ridge which later becomes moulded into the tip of the nose. The upper triangular area becomes the dorsum of the nose, the lower quadrilateral portion

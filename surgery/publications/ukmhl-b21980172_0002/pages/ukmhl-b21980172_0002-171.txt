OPERATIONS FOR DOUBLE HARE-LIP i43 ieben's modification of Blandin's method).^—The muco-periosteum on the free edge of the nasal septum is incised in an antero-posterior direction about half an inch behind the premaxilla. The length of the incision corresponds to the distance that the premaxilla projects beyond the alveolus. The muco-periosteum is then freely ■separated from each side of the vomer, and the bone divided by a vertical cut made with a pair of scissors. The premaxilla can now be pushed back with ease, and, if necessary, trimmed until it fits into the cleft. Though it is maintained in position by the plastic ■operation that is immediately performed upon the lip, it is sometimes Fig. 314.—Rose's operation for double hare-lip. necessary to fix it to the maxillaj with a couple of chromicized catgut sutures. Operations for bilateral hare-lip. Rose's method.—When the preraaxillary bone is in proper position, the skin over it is freed and pared laterally to resemble the letter V. Flaps are then cut from each margin of the cleft, inverted, and sutured above to the premaxillary skin, and below to each other, as depicted in Fig. 314. In most cases this method yields an excellent cosmetic result, but if the upper lip is shallow and skimpy, or the clefts are very wide, Hagedorn's method is more suitable. Hagedorns method.—After freshening the edges of the skin over the premaxilla, as in Fig. 315, a flap is cut by tlie incisions 4, 2 ; 2, 3, from the outer margin of the cleft on each side, with its base at the jimction of the horizontal and vertical portions of the vermilion border. These two flaps are inverted, and pulled upon so as to straighten them out. An incision, 1, a, is now made downwards and outwards into the lip, commencing a short distance above the level of the lateral angle a, on tiie premaxillary tab of skin. This incision, when opened up, gives additional height to the lip and, when the

FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE 128 Treatment.—Simple clefts may be closed by suture after paring the edges, but clefts involving the orbit generally require a complicated plastic operation. FISTULA OF THE LIP The opening of a fistulous track, lined with mucous membrane and directed upwards towards the ala of the nose, is sometimes seen on the red margin of the upper lip, close to the philtrum. Its presence is probably due to defective fusion of the soft parts, and serves to emphasize a lucky escape from hare-lip. In some instances similar good fortune is shown in a more definite manner by the presence of a well-marked groove at the site of union of the globular and maxillary processes. Congenital fistulse of the lower lip situated on either side of the mid-line have also been described. Their method of form- ation is obscure. Treatment is only required if the fistula gives rise to a copious discharge, or repeatedly becomes in- flamed from retention of its secretion. In such a case, one or more applications of the galvano - cautery will suffice to close it. MANDIBULAR CLEFT This defect usually involves both the bone and the soft parts, and is situated in the middle line of the lower jaw at the point where the two mandibular processes should have united (Fig. 300). It is the rarest congenital malformation of the face, and seldom occurs alone, being usually associated with various forms of facial cleft, or with a cleft of the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Treatment.—The cleft may be closed by one of the methods employed in the treatment of hare-lip. HARE-LIP Hare-lip is the commonest malformation of the face, and, according to Stone, occurs in one out of every 2,400 infants. Though isolated Fig. 301.—H. H.

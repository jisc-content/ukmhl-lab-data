THE (ESOPHAGUS 262 There are undoubtedly other explanations for this condition, as Halsted points out. Injury to the oesophageal wall in this region has been followed by pouch formations, and the association of congenital stricture of the upper part of the oesophagus with a diverticulum has been re- corded. {See Fig. 348.) Pressure diverticula generally occur in elderly male patients. They often give a history of long- standing dysphagia, and the first symptoms are merely those indicative of stenosis of the cbso- phagus, for a long period unaccompanied by loss of weight or deteriora- tion in health. Later the following symptoms arise: If solid food be taken, a feeling of dis- comfort and pressure is experienced in the neck, as if a foreign body were present. Eegurgitations of portions of food occur sometimes shortly after eating, but occasionally at long intervals, even twelve hours after a meal. Ejection of gas may accompany the eva- cuation of the food by the mouth. The food is undigested, and not at all suggestive of stomach contents ; and when the pouch gets filled, further passage of food down the oesophagus may be completely arrested. The oesophagus becomes pushed to one side, and the pouch comes to lie more directly in a line with the lower part of the pharynx. Pressure on the filled pouch in the neck may be followed by rejection of some portion of the contained food. The spitting up of quantities of mucus has been noticed in one case.

665 THE SIGMOIDOSCOPE The introduction of the sigmoidoscope, and tlie interpretation of the picture seen, require practice. Houston's valves may offer some impediment to its passage, but tliis is easily overcome by a little manipulation; their appearance is too characteristic to cause confusion with a pathological con- dition. A little practice is required to facilitate the passage of the instrument along the sacro-coccygeal curve. Any stricture, simple or malignant, or any tumour pressing upon the bowel will naturally cause some impediment to the passage of the tube. The correct interpretation of the appearance observed requires experience, and implies sigmoidoscopic familiarity with the normal rectum. The sigmoidoscope affords invaluable diagnostic aid in rectal lesions situated beyond the reach of the finger. It is invaluable also in the diagnosis of ulcer- D Fig. 482.â€”The sigmoidoscope.

When it is used in cases of ulceration great care must be exercised to avoid perfora- tion of the diseased bowel wall. MALFORMATIONS It is impossible in the very early human embryo to differentiate the allantois and the hind-gut, but as the hind-end of the embryo grows, the body-stalk, originally attached at the hind-end, becomes more ventral, as also does the termination of the allantois, so that a U-shaped bend, the hind- gut, is formed in the dorsal part of the tube. At this stage, therefore, there is a common chamber, the cloaca, into which open the hind-gut and the allantois. The opening of the hind-gut into the cloaca disappears early. As the hind-end of the embryo grows backwards, the dorsal part grows more rapidly than the ventral, and carries with it the hind-gut beyond the

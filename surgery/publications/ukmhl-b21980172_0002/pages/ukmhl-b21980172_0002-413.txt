GASTRIC FIBROMA 375 pus is found the rib below should be resected, the diaphragm fixed to the intercostal muscles with catgut stitches, and the abscess opened and drained. Anterior abscesses should only be drained from the front when no pus is discovered by thorough posterior exploration. BENIGN TUMOURS Benign tumours of the stomach and duodenum^ are rare, and may be divided into three groups :— 1. Coimective-tissue tumours. 2. Glandular tumours (adenomas). 3. Cysts. 1. CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS This group of tumours includes—i. Fibromas. ii. Fibro-myomas. iii. Lipomas. . ^ 1. llBROMAS These are rarely met with. They may occur as polypoid tumours in the pyloric region, single or multiple. (Fig. 383.) They may be encapsuled in the gastric wall, as in the case reported Fig. 3S3.—Fibroma of stomach. {Lo>tthn }{osf>itiiL Museum,) by W. G. Spencer in which he successfully removed a fibroma weighing 7 oz. from the posterior wall of the stomach of a woman of 46. According to Fenwick, no case hitherto recorded has been above suspicion of malignancy. Treatment.—Pedunculated tumours should be removed by cutting through the pedicle and suturing the mucous membrane. When embedded in the gastric wall they should be enucleated or excised with the affected part of the stomach. ii. Myomas and Fibro-Myomas These constitute the commonest variety of simple tumour of the stomach; 61 cases (Thomson of Galveston) have been published since the first was recorded by Morgagni in 1762.

RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL 68o hsemorrlioid is cut off, tlie edges of the mucous membrane sutured with the long ends of the ligature, and the clamp removed. 4. Whitehead's operation is performed as follows: An incision is made circumferentially through the skin of the anal canal imme- diately outside the muco-cutaneous junction (Fig. 496). The incision is deepened until the external sphincter muscle is exposed (Fig. 497). The mucous membrane in its entirety is dissected oif the underlying structures until healthy mucosa above is reached (Fig. 498). The diseased mucosa is removed, and the healthy cut edge is sutured to the skin of the anal margin (Fig. 499). Fig. 496. Fig. 497. First and second stages of Whitehead's operation. {See text.) After-treatment.—Shortly after the operation a hypodermic injection of morphia is given. The bowels are confined for four days. If the bowel has been thoroughly emptied before operation, there will be no difficulty in this ; should it be thought desirable, a catechu and opium mixture may be given for the purpose. On the night of the tliird day an aperient is administered, and in order to soften the motion, and so to lessen pain, some warm oil is injected into the rectum. Just before the bowels act some cocaine ointment may be applied to the wound. The wound must be kept scrupulously clean, and particular attention paid to it after defaecation. The complications that may arise after the operation are— (a) Hcemorrhage.—This occurs either from the slipping of a ligature or from an unoccluded vessel. It is evidenced by the general signs of

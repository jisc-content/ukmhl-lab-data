URETHRAL FISTULA 899 1 FISTULA AND ACQUIRED DEFECTS Urethral fistulse may open on to the skin of the penis, scrotum, perineum, groin, gUiteal region, or into the rectum. £itiology.—Congenital defects may take the form of hypospadias or epispadias (pp. 966, 967). The most common congenital form is a fistula of the membranous or prostatic urethra, and is combined with atresia ani, and the perineal muscles may be atrophied. Acquired fistula arises from trauma, inflammation, or new growth. Trauma- tic fistula arises from within the urethra from false passages and sloughing due to tying in a metal catheter, and from without by stabs, impaling, bullet wounds, etc., or after surgical operations such as ex- ternal urethrotomy (Fig. 552), perineal prostatec- tomy, and after opening or rupture of a peri- urethral abscess or the incision of gangrenous periurethritis. Tubercu- lous disease and bilhar- Fig. 552.—Acquired defect of urethra after removal of large urethral calculus. ziosis are rare causes. Symptoms.— Urine escapes from the fistula during micturi- tion. The symptoms of .stricture are also present. Fistula of the penile urethra usually opens directly into the ure- tlira, and is surrounded by a firm ring of fibrous tissue. In perineal fis- tula there may be one or several openings. The fistulse are surrounded by hard, fibrous indura- tion. In urethro-rectal fistula the urine is dis- charged into the rectum at each micturition, and produces a watery motion. Oas may be passed along the urethra and faecal matter escape with the urine. Urethritis and cystitis are usually present. Treatment.—The treatment of fistula with massive induration has already been discussed. In cases without induration the stricture is dilated, or internal urethrotomy performed and a catheter tied in the urethra for a week. The fistula is scraped and cauterized, or dissected down to the Fig. 553.—Result of plastic operation for repair of defect: same case.

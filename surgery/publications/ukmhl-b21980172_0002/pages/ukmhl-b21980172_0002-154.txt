126 FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE palatine processes. In such cases the premaxilla, having no lateral attachments to fix it, is pushed forward by the palatine processes as they approach each other, and at the same time undergoes excessive development from lack of restraint {see Fig. 305). MALFORMATIONS MACKOSTOMA Macrostoma, or buccal cleft, is due either to failure of union of the posterior portions of the maxillary and mandibular processes, or, after union has - taken place, to arrested growth caused by the pressure of amniotic bands. (Fig. 299.) The condition varies from a slight defect at the angle of the mouth to a cleft which may ex- tend nearly to the auricle ; though usually bilateral, it may be unilateral, and in either case is not infrequently associated with other congenital defects, such as oblique facial cleft and accessory auricles. As usually seen, the defect is limited to a slight increase in the size of the oral aper- ture, and, beyond its unsightly appearance, gives rise to no incon- venience ; but in severe cases the constant escape of saliva, and the defective nutrition that results from the inability of the child to retain food in the mouth, render an operation imperative. Treatmentâ€”The edges of the cleft should be pared with a sharp scalpel, and then imited with an inner muco-mucous layer of catgut and an outer cutaneous layer of fine salmon-gut sutures. The only detail requiring attention is the identification of Stenson's duct before paring the edges of the cleft. Fig, 299. -Macrostoma with auricular appendages.

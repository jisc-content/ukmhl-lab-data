THE UTERUS 1026 increased operability rate, as compared with vaginal hysterectomy, must be taken into account. Comyns Berkeley, in an exhaustive paper, has shown that if the cases be classified according to the stage of the disease at the time of operation, the mortality figures are— early, 6'3 per cent. ; advanced, 231 per cent. The mortality of the operation, therefore, as applied to early cases, i.e. those which might have been dealt with by vaginal hysterectomy, is about the same as that of the latter operation. The difficulties of the procedure increase greatly in advanced cases, and are especially formidable in very stout women. Moreover, the hospital patients in whom the disease is most commonly met are from Fig. 593.—Fungating type of carcinoma of the body of the uterus. the surgical standpoint a most unsatisfactory class, most of them being enfeebled and prematurely aged by a life of hardship and want. In a large proportion the heart is fatty or the kidneys are degenerate. The ultimate results of the operation must at present be estimated from Continental figures, for it has not been practised sufiiciently long in Great Britain. According to Wertheim, nearly 60 per cent, of those operated upon by him were alive five years afterwards. Allowing for a wide margin on results so remarkable as these, British surgeons would be satisfied with 20 per cent, of cures, which would still be an enormous advance on the results of vaginal hysterectomy. The operation must not, however, be judged solely by the permanent cures effected, for, remembering that these patients, when they first seek advice, have, on an average, less than eighteen imhappy months

696 RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL tlie whole track may be dissected out. The communication with the bowel should be laid open as in the simple fistula. The wound may be partially closed by sutures, and primary union in part may be anticipated. Of greater rarity than the above is the variety in which the tubercles are deposited irregularly in the mucous or submucous tissues of the bowel ivall (Fig. 502). These degenerate, and finally ulceration ensues. The tuberculous ulcer may be seen on any part of the rectal wall. At first it is superficial with thin undermined edges, and on its floor may perhaps be seen caseating areas. The surround- ing mucosa be- comes much swollen, and probably shows yellowish areas of caseating tu- bercle. Adja- cent ulcers will coalesce until a considerable part of the rec- tal wall is in- volved ; indeed, in some ad- vanced cases almost the en- tire rectum may be in- vaded. The ul- ceration ma}'' spread to the anal canal and destroy the sphincters. The depth of a tuberculous ulcer is very variable. If it is allowed to progress the muscular wall may become eroded, the peritoneum involved, or suppuration may occur in the pelvi-rectal space or in the ischio-rectal fossa. The symptoms are those of ulceration of the rectum, described at p. 698. The condition has to be diagnosed from chronic septic ulcera- tion, syphilis, and malignant disease. In a great majority of cases pul- monary tuberculosis is present. Diagnosis is only established by the examination of the granulation tissue or the discovery of the tubercle bacillus in the scrapings of the ulcer. The latter is generally an easy matter in this form of ulceration. The course of the disease varies.

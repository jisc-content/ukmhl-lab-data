Some of these tumours have been described as lymphadenomas of stomach, a condition which, if it occurs at all, is very rare. 4. Secondary to retroperitoneal glands.—The intestinal tract is never, or rarely aiiected in true lymphadenoma. It is well known that, in lymphadenoma in other parts of the body, glands which for years have been clinically " lymphadenomatous " may coalesce and infiltrate Fig. 389.—Secondary involvement of stomach in " lymph {Salanian^ Proc. nf Path.

Many groups of glands and the tonsils are usually involved. Salaman collected 8 cases and suggested the name lymphadeno-sarcoma for these growths. Symptoms.—The symptoms of round-celled sarcoma resemble those of carcinoma of the stomach. A tumour is jjresent in about 30 per cent, of these cases. Hemorrhage is rare. Secondary deposits in the skin are not uncommon.

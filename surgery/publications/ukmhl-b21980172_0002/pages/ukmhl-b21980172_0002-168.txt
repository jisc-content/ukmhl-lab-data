140 FACE, LIPS, AND PALATE o a. o of the flap B D c is re- moved by an oblique in- cision so placed that the edges of the red border come into accurate ap- position. This incision should not be made until the flap has been laid in position. Edmund Owen's operation, though re- sembling that of Mirault to a certain extent, differs from it materially in that the flap which is brought across the fissure is large and fleshy instead of thin and attenuated. The me- thod is particularly ap- plicable to the closure of large and deep clefts with asymmetrical sides, and in good hands gives most excellent results. The mucous membrane on the smaller side of the cleft and lip is removed nearly as far as the angle of the mouth (Fig. 310). On the opposite side a large flap is cut, with its apex at the top of the cleft. The incision by which this flap is formed is, near its extremity, car- ried parallel to the normal line of the lip for a short distance, so as to diminish the tendency to puckering that takes place at this point when the sutures are inserted. The large flap thus formed is then turned down, forming the mucous

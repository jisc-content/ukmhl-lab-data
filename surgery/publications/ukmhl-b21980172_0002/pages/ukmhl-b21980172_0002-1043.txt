ABSENT PENIS—WEBBED PENIS 965 THE PENIS CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES ABSENCE OF THE PENIS Absence of the penis is very rare, and in reported cases the urethra has opened into the rectum. Apparent absence is more common, a small penis being hidden in the pad of fat over the symphysis pubis. In a case lander my care the penis in a healthy child was represented by a small depression above the scrotum, through ■which the urine was voided. A small penis was dissected out and circumcision performed. In some cases the penis is adherent by its under-surface to the skin of the scrotum (webbed penis. Fig. 573), and can be freed by a plastic operation. DOUBLE PENIS This is a rare abnormality, but authentic cases have been reported. Both penes may be func- tional and void urine and semen. Epispadias and hypospadias are usually accompanied by defomiity of the penis, which in hypospadias of the complete and peno-scrotal varieties is usually small, curved downwards, and fastened to the scrotum by bands of skin.

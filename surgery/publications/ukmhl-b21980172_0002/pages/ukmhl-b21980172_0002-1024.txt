946 THE TESTIS tozoa (spermatoceles). It is doubtful, however, if these two classes are distinct from one another, and, as the exact pathology of cysts of the epididymis is uncertain, it is unnecessary to make the division. Pathology.—Probably these cysts do not all arise in the same way ; the following views of their origin are held :— 1. They are retention cysts of the tubules of the epididymis or vasa eSerentia. 2. They arise in foetal remnants such as the para- didymis (organ of Giraldes), the vas aberrans, the remains of Miiller's duct, or the pronephros (hydatid of Morgagni). This view would make them analogous to some cysts of the ovary and embryonic in origin. 3. They are due to bursting of an excretory tubule into the connective tissue round the epididymis. 4. They form in the connective tissue and have a secondary connexion with the excretory tubules. Pathological anatomy.— Cysts of the epididymis most com- monly occur in the region of the globus major and extend upwards into the cord, depressing the body of the testis so that it lies more horizontally than usual. (Fig- 567.) They are frequently bila- teral, and may be multiple and loculated. They vary in size from a pin's head to a cyst containing five or six ounces of fluid, and are usually of very slow growth. The fluid contained in them is either (a) a pale limpid fluid with only a trace of albumin, or (6) a milky- white opalescent fluid containing some albumin and many sper- matozoa, either living and active or dead and disintegrating ; it is usually the large cysts that contain spermatozoa. The cyst may persist in spite of several tappings, or may disappear after tapping. Fig. 567.—Cyst of the epididymis.

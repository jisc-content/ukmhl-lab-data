Overlooked malignant disease or pro- gressive pancreatitis may lead to disappointing results after otherwise successful operations. NEW GROWTHS Simple growths of the gall-bladder and ducts are very rare; fibromas, lipomas, and cys- tic adenomas have been met with; papillomas are the most frequent, but here apparently they are not so closely associated with cancer as elsewhere.

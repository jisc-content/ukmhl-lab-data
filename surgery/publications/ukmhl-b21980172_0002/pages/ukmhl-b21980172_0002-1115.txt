1037 MYOMA: SYMPTOMS proper not being enlarged. Menorrhagia with a large subperitoneal myoma suggests the coexistence of a small submucous nodule. Cervical myomas are, however, often associated with very severe loss, although they do not involve the menstrual area proper. Patients thus afflicted become very ansemic, and eventually develop cachexia associated with breathlessness and cardiac degeneration. Dysmenorrhoea is not a common symptom. When present it is of the Fig. 604.—Carcinoma of the body of a myomatous uterus. obstructive variety, and consists in violent spasms of pain associated with the passage of clots from the uterus. 2. Pressure symptoms.—These, when severe, are generally due to impaction of the tumour in the pelvis. Cervical myomas are particularly prone to this complication. A myomatous uterus, like a pregnant one, may become retroverted and incarcerated. The bladder is usually the first organ to exhibit symptoms of pressure, generally in the form of frequency of micturition ; retention is less common and, when present, implies impaction. Pressure on the ureter is much rarer than might be supposed, but in cases of prolonged impaction these conduits are found dilated. The bowel is less frequently occluded by pressure than by Idnking due to displacement or adhesions. Partial intestinal obstruction is not uncommon, but acute symptoms are comparatively rare.

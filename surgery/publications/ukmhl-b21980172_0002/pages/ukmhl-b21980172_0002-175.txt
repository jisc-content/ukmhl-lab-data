CLEFT PALATE 147 eacli half of the premaxilla long after the cleft formation in the palate has taken place. (Sec under Development of the Premaxilla, p. 125.) Consequently, it is now generally acknowledged that the cleft passes between the premaxilla and the maxilla, or, in other words, is meso- exognathic. The varying relationship of the incisor teeth to the margins of the cleft is thus explained by Arthur Keith : " The germ of the lateral incisor, although carried by the mesial nasal process, is laid down in the cleft between the maxillary and premaxillary II IV Fig. 319.—Four specimens of cleft palate, showing various degrees in the development of the bond between the premaxillary, maxillary, and lateral nasal processes.

In cases of cleft palate the processes move apart under the strain of growth during the middle and later months of foetal life. Three fates may then overtake the bud of the lateral incisor : it may be destroyed, it may remain attached to the pre- maxillary process, but more frequently it moves outwards attached to the maxillary process. I have seen it stranded on the bridge of tissue between the processes, or loosely attached at one side of the fissure or the other.'' (Fig. .319.)

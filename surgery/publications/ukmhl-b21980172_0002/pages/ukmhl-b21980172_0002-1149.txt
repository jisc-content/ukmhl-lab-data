1071 OVARIAN CYSTS (b) Inflamma- tory broad-liga- ment cysts.— These cysts, origi- nating more parti- cularly in the deeper part of the broad ligament, are produced by lymphatic blockage {lymphatic cysts), and may then be multilocular, or they may be formed by encyst- ment of a broad- ligament abscess with gradual dis- integration of the pus until a thin grumous fluid re- sults. 4. Tubal cysts—Accessory fimbriated extremi- ties of the Fallo- pian tube are not uncommonly found as short "anemone- like " processes, and represent the permanence of the primitive coi>lomic ostia, of which there are three. Sampson Handley first pointed out that certain cysts arising in this situation are de- veloped from such vestiges. They are unilocular, present, when small, a Fig. 619.—Wall of dermoid cyst. It shows a well-formed skin containing hair-follicles, sebaceous and sweat-glands, and unstriped muscle fibres. Fig. 620.—Cyst-embryoma. Various tissues are seen embedded, in which may be noted a mass of cartilage and several spaces lined with different types of epithelium.

CLEFT PALATE: LANE'S OPERATION 157 very wide, the raised flap r a z can be converted into a mobile flap by continuing the incision from z to Y, and bent inwards to cover the large reflected flap (Fig. 325). In raising this flap the operator must avoid carrying the dissection too far in a backward direction, or he will divide the anterior palatine artery, a vessel that must be preserved. Figs. 326 and 327 represent the method of closing a cleft in- volving the soft palate and a portion of the hard palate. The flap A G H is cut from the nasal surface of the soft palate, and is then reflected inwards and superimposed upon the reflected flap a b c d, as in Fig. 327. Fig. 328 depicts a large cleft with a mesial nasal septum. If it be considered impossible to close this at one operation by the method already described, it can be closed in two stages by another method. First stage.—Flaps a B c d and E f g H are outUned and freed, care being taken to avoid injuring the great palatine arteries. The flap IJ K L, attached at K L, is turned backwards and sutured to the nasal septum along its line of contact, after the mucous membrane on both flap and septum has been removed along this line. The two large lateral flaps are then pivoted inwards and their anterior extre- mities are sutured together as in Fig. 329. Second stage.—This is deferred until the raw surface left after Z B Figs. .3:24 and :)-2."). -These and the six following diagrams illustrate the application of Arbuthnot Lane's method to different varieties of cleft (sec text for each).

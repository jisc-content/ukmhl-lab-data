274 THE CESOPHAGUS Careful traction of the stomach downwards with flexion of the spine renders the cardiac orifice easier of access (Bryant). Mortality of cesophagotomy for foreign bodies Tillman quotes 6. Fischer—in 108 cases a mortality of 26 per cent.—and Eglof?—in 135 cases a mortality of 24'8 per cent. OBSTRUCTION The conditions which lead to a narrowing of the oesophagus, giving rise to dysphagia, are as follows :— I. INTRINSIC, originating in the oesophageal wall. 1. /Spasm of the muscle coat. GEsophago-spasm. Cardio-spasm. Globus hystericus. 2. Cicatricial contracture, consequent upon ulceration of the mucous membrane. Causes—(a) Wounds. (6) Burns, (c) Syphilis. {d) Tuberculosis, (e) Typhoid fever. (/) Peptic ulcers. 3. New growths. {a) Innocent. \h) Malignant. II. EXTRINSIC. Pressure on, or invasion of, the wall of the oesophagus from without. 1. Aneurysms. 2. Tumours. Enlarged glands, new growths. 3. Abscess. INTRINSIC OBSTRUCTION Spasm of the Muscle Coat A difluse dilatation of the wall of the oesophagus associated with contraction of the cardiac opening, or cardio-spasm, occurs in young adults of both sexes. The etiology of this somewhat rare condition has given rise to much discussion, and its treatment to the exhibition of much mechanical ingenuity. Pathology,—The specimen of which Fig. 353 is a drawing shows the pathological changes usually present. The muscular coat of the entire wall of the oesophagus is hypertrophied, whilst, in the lower three-fourths of its extent, marked dilatation has taken place. The mucous coat is also greatly thickened, and scattered over its surface are numerous shallow ulcers. At the cardiac orifice the

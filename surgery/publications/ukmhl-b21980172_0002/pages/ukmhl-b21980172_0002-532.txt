THE INTESTINES 486 Fig, 415.—Single intussusception. obstruction, it is convenient for clinical purposes to de- scribe tlie condition in terms of this variety. Three different foinas are met with : (1) The ileo-ccecal, in which the ileo-csecal valve forms the apex of the in- tussusception— tills is the commonest form ; (2) the ileo-colic, in which the in- vagination begins in the last few inches of the ileum (Fig. 417) ; and (3) the ccecal, in wliich the inverted csecum forms the apex. It is not always easy, however, in the course of an operation to distinguish these varieties of intussusception from one another. Etiology.—The subjects of intussusception are usually lusty children in apparently perfect health, but it is generally possible to elicit a history of seme recent slight disturbance of the bowels in the form of constipation or diar- rhoea, in which the peri- staltic function of the gut has been deranged, and it is probably to ir- regular muscular contrac- tion that the commence- ment of the invagination is due. A portion of in- flamed or swollen mucous membrane is pushed or pulled towards the lumen of the segment of gut just beyond, and acts as an irritant, setting up a re- flex similar to that by which a bolus of food is passed along the bowel.

CHRONIC ENDOCERVICITIS 1009 Fig. 582.—Cervical erosion, granular stage. granular {granular erosion) (Fig. 582). The discliarge is mucous or mucopurulent. Stage 2.—Subepithelial lymphocytosis is still marked, but other inflammatory cells are appearing (large hyaline cells and plasma cells). The cervical glands are hypertrophied and tortuous, and ■^^^^^^'t abnormally mucini- ferous. In the eroded area the basal layers of the epithelium have in- grown to form new glandular crypts (glandular erosion). In some cases definite papillte of the hypercellular subepithelial tissue project on the surface, giving it a raised velvety aspect {pafillary or villous erosion) (Fig. 583). The discharge is clear mucus, and very profuse. Stage 3. — Sub- epithelial fibrosis occurs with disap- pearance of elastic fibres and a diminu- tion of cellularity. The epithelium of the cervical canal thickens, and be- comes almost squamous in places. In the eroded area this hypertrophy is very marked, the epithelium exhibit- ing interpapillary down-growths like those of the skin. (Fig. 584.) The glandular crypts be- come occluded by the thickened epithelium and the contraction of fibrous tissue, and numerous slightly raised faintly blue retention cysts present on the surface (ovules of Naboth). The rest of the " erosion area" is whitish (cervical leucoplakia). The discharge progressively diminishes as the glands become occluded, 3 ^ Fig. 583.—Cervical erosion, adenomatous stage.

452 THE INTESTINES disease in the rectum (Fig. 403). Througli a wound in the parietes a knuckle of the pelvic colon is brought out, and fixed by a glass rod passed through its mesentery. An opening is made on the convex aspect of the bowel, with the' result that both the afierent and efferent tubes present on the surface, the mesenteric waU of the gut forming a septum or " spur " between them, which directs the flow out through the opening and prevents the contents reaching the distal or efferent tube. As a rule, such an artificial anus is intended to be permanent, but similar openings are frequently made in this and other parts of the Fig. 403.â€”Artificial anus. bowel as a temporary expedient, and when the necessity for the opening is past it should be closed. The main difficulty in effecting the closure arises from the presence of the spur between the afferent and eft'erent loops. This may be destroyed by crushing it between the blades of a powetful clamp or " enterotome." The septum or spur is defined by passing a finger into each of the tubes of bowel, and, one blade of the enterotome being passed along each finger, the spur is crushed by closing the instrument. It is then supported by dressings and left in position till it causes necrosis of the spur and comes away, which usually happens in two to four days. The continuity of the bowel being thus restored, the external opening gradually closes. A more certain and expeditious method is to separate the bowel from the abdominal wall by dissection, and invert the edges of the opening by sutures. The parietal wound is then closed. If it appears that the invagination of the opening in the bowel tends to narrow the lumen imduly, it is better to resect the segment implicated and establish a lateral anastomosis.

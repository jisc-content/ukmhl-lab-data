RECTUM AND ANAL CANAL Fig. 514:.—Cancer of rectum. those from the lower portion of the bowel may pass to the oblique inguinal glands. This, however, is not confirmed by clinical expe- rience, since these glands are not invaded by a rectal cancer. A rectal cancer may involve any or all of these glands. The duration and extent of the cancer is no criterion of the extent of the glandular involvement. In a com- paratively small primary growth extensive glandular involvement may be pre- sent, and vice versa. Enlarged glands in as- sociation with cancer of the bowel are not necessarily cancerous. There is always the possibility of mere septic absorption from the ulcerating growth. 3. Spread by the blood stream.—We are entirely ignorant of the processes which govern the spread of cancer by tliis route. Visceral metastases are not necessarily a late occurrence. We have in- sufficient data to judge of their frequency; in fifty consecutive autopsies upon persons dying from the disease, at very varying intervals after the appear- ance of symptoms, I found metastases were recorded in seven only. In all the liver was involved, and in one the spleen. In three, secondary growths were scattered over the peritoneum, but possibly in these the spread was by the lymphatics. Symptoms.—The typical symptoms are those of ulceration com- bined with stricture {see pp. 699 and 704). In intensity each symptom varies within wide limits. Hcemorrhage and the teasing diarrhoea may be absent for some time ; clinical evidence of material narrowing of

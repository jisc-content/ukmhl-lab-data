DEVELOPMENT OF FACE AND LIPS 123 the columella, i.e. the septum between the anterior nares. By the elevation of this median portion to form the external nasal organ, the globular processes are enabled to fuse together to form the middle third of the upper lip (philtrum) and the premaxilla. Imperfect union in this situation leads to that rare malformation, median hare- lip. While these changes are taking place above, the mandibular processes below have united (in the fifth week) to form the mandible, lower lip, and chin. All that is now required to complete the face cerebrum Fig. 296.â€”Showing the parts of the face formed from the nasal, maxillary, and mandibular processes. {From Ki'ith's Hiivian Embryology and Morpholo;^y. ") is the closure of the gap between the mandibular bars and the lateral nasal and fronto-nasal processes. This is effected by a bud-like projection known as the maxillary process, which springs from the upper border of the base of the mandibular bar on each side, and sweeps inwards and forwards beneath the eye and the nasal groove, thereby separating them from the oral cavity. Above, it blends with the lateral nasal process to complete the ala of the nose ; anteriorly, with the globular process to com- plete the upper lip ; and below, with the mandibular bar to diminish the size of the oral aperture. Therefore, failure of union between the maxillary and either of these three processes results in facial cleft, lateral hare-lip, or macrostoma. (Fig. 296.) Conversely, fusion of the maxillary and mandibular processes beyond the normal degree leads to microstoma.

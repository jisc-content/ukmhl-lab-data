220 Enquiries in Surgery of Trunk, Thorax, Sf Abdomen. Polypi of the Umbilicus.—I have twice in babies removed by ligature (and with success) finely granulated small polypi, probably originating in granulations and kept up by some obscure source of irritation. A case of fistula in a little girl of four, which I saw with a medical friend, had certain curious characters. Some induration and swelling existed from birth, but during the third and fourth years the child became subject to paroxysms of most violent pain in the vicinity of the umbilicus. The induration at the umbilicus increased in size, became some- what irregular, and was traversed by a fine, tortuous, fistulous canal. During a paroxysm of unusually severe pain, a little limpid, colourless fluid would escape, and immediately the pain ceased for a time. A probe could be passed, though with difficulty, into the abdomen, and appeared to move freely in all directions. The removal of the indurated mass down to the linea alba, by elliptical incisions, effected a cure after the failure of some milder measures. ENQUIRIES IN THE SURGERY OF HERNIA. A Simple Extea-Peritoneal Operation for Strangulated Hernia. No one will dispute the general proposition that the first principle in the treatment of strangulated hernia is to operate early. To be early is more important than how to operate. At the same time it seems a platitude to say that where there is choice of operations, the simplest and safest that will effect the desired end should be preferred. The rule which should guide us in all cases of stran- gulated hernia seems clear. Either a given case is one which we desire to reduce by taxis, or it is not. If it is suitable for the use of taxis, and under amesthesia taxis fails, .it is the surgeon’s duty to adopt a minimum of operative proceeding which will secure the success of the taxis; if the case is not suitable for taxis, as a matter of practice it will be necessary to open the sac.

PREFACE In the preface to the first edition of this work I said it was a Collection of Notes which I hoped to be able to make more complete at another time. In this edition, while still aiming at brevity, I have spoken more at length. The Hastings Essay on Shock has been revised and included in these pages. Here, too, are reproduced, after an examination in the light of additional experience, certain views on the treatment of the inflammations which specially fall under the care of the surgeon. I have also added various Clinical Lectures and Notes on subjects in which I have taken special interest, or which I have had unusual opportunities of investigating. Many friends and correspondents, not a few of them far away from large collections of books, transactions, and serials, ask me where they can find a description of some operation, or some method of treatment which I have from time to time, and with unavoidable condensation, brought under their notice. If it served no other purpose than that of meeting their wants I should look upon the labour given to the publication of this volume as sufficiently rewarded. If others should find in its pages any helpful suggestion my reward will bo the greater.

190 Enquiries in the Surgery of the Tlead and Neele. Pressure with bits of fine Turkey sponge best checks whatever bleeding there may be between the soft parts and the bone. The stitches may be left in six or eight days. There is no advantage in taking them out early. The transverse linear cut which any stitch makes ceases early at a certain point; the resulting linear cicatrix is soon lost and it would not be lessened by early removal. On a Method of obtaining Symmetry after Operations for Hare-lip. It is a melancholy, but in a great number of cases an unavoidable fact, that some unsightliness remains after operations for hare-lip. The want of symmetry is occasion- ally very conspicuous, especially if it occurs in an otherwise comely girl or woman. That this deformity should be tolerated for a life-time, with no attempts at improvement, and no enquiry into its possibility, is a curious result of custom and timidity both of the public and of surgeons. In no department of the surgery of policy, as distinguished from the surgery of necessity, can greater benefit be pre- dicted than in the interference with old and unsatisfactory cicatrices in hare-lip. It would be erroneous and unjust to infer that in these cases the operation has been improperly performed. An early operation is essential to give shapeliness to the alveolar cleft, as well as for the sake of appearance and efficient feeding; but in certain cases the circumstances are such, that no possible operation at an early period can be satisfactory for a life time. The perfection of to-day is a defect to-morrow. An old and defective cicatrix may be due to various causes : the bony irregularity may have been extreme; the operation may have been too early or too late; or (as it must be admitted too frequently happens) the operative proceedings have been too timidly carried out; or a number of hinder- ing causes may have been combined. In such cases as these, much improvement may be

Enquiries in Surgery of Trunlc, Thorax, 8f Abdomen. 255 of sorts, were the only symptoms. The finger on being introduced into the rectum immediately came upon a remarkable and fixed obstruction. This proved to be a hard, long, finger-like, and tapering mass about two inches in length, which was fixed by its broad end to the centre of the cavity of the sacrum. The pointed end pushed before it the rectum and, as might be expected, the posterior wall especially. There could be little doubt that it was bony and perhaps rather of the nature of an osteophyte than an exostosis. It appeared by pushing forward the posterior wall of the rectum to divide the rectum into a complete double tube: the left tube being the larger of the two. I venture to put forward this ground of hope— that time, mild aperients, and, above all, time, would gradually accustom the rectum to the mechanical obstruction, and especially by more and more enlarging the channel on the left side of the rectal cavity. I saw the case about four years ago, and her medical attendant tells me she is now in fair health, and has little or no trouble with the bowel. If the symptoms of obstruction had increased, or proved persistently troublesome, Amussat’s operation was kept in view as a measure of reserve.

Shortly after this Professor Vanzetti, of Padua, noticed with interest a similar condition, and while engaged in its observation he received the number of the Medical Times and Gazette which contained my fuller account and diagram of the collar. In an article in a leading Italian medical serial he reproduced my views and diagram in conjunction with the reports and photographs of his cases and courteously sent me copies of them. Mr. C. Williams, of Norwich, also sent me reports of cases with remarks which proved of great value to me. The late Dr. Tilbury Fox also referred to my description of the ancle collar in his writings on skin diseases, and although I am unable to agree with his classifi- cation in reference to it, his name is cited here to show that the ailment under discussion is a real one, and justifies me in again drawing attention to it.

The patient is a young woman, between fifteen and five and twenty; she has moderately good health, but not a strong circulation; the catamenia arc persistently deficient and irregular.

Enquiries in Surgery Generally. 24 especially in tlie dicrotism, and illustrates that slight degree (in this case very slight, for the patient was remarkably free from the excitable, emotional, nervous temperament) of shock from the operation of psychical causes which is likely to be present half an hour before an important operation. The second trace was taken one hour and twenty minutes after the operationâ€”a little too late to represent the greatest severity of the shock. The much shorter ascent of the lever, as represented, shows very forcibly the diminished propulsive power of the heart; but it also shows greater regularity, as well as feebler action of the heart. This unexpected pecu- liarity may perhaps be attributed to the diminished influence of mental causes, due partly to the shock to the nervous system, and partly to the still lingering effects of chloroform. There is also less concavity in the general descent of the trace, which is most probably caused by the impeded trans- mission of the blood through the capillaries, which, as the experiments I have to bring forward will show, is prone to occur in shock. It may also be partly due to the fact that, in consequence of the removal of a large part of the body, there is relatively more blood in the vessels. The following trace was taken for me by my friend and (then) colleague Dr. Foster, on the morning of the second day. The difference between this and the last is very notice- able, not so much in the line of ascent, which is only slightly higher, but in the roundness of the junction of the ascending and descending lines, and still more so in the greater dis- tinctness of the dicrotism, which forms a distinct second elevation, and which is very characteristic of fever. It is not necessary for me to dwell on the advantages to be derived from the use of the sphygmograph in medicine and surgery. The impression made on the Auger by tlio pulse is

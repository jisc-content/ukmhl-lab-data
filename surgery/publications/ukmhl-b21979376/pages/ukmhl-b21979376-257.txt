One strip is put on round the centre of the trunk, the ends overlapping in front; another strip is put on higher up, it reaches the axillae, and is so put on that a cone is formed with the base upwards ; the third strip is put on below, it reaches the trochanters, and is so arranged that a cone is formed with its base directed downwards. These cones are not formed artificially; they naturally follow the neat adjust- ment, with moderate traction of the three strips to the trunk. The upper and lower strips well overlap the middle, which latter may be a little wider than the others. The central strip may be put on first or last. The three may be made to fit the trunk like a glove, and they secure double conicity more certainly than do the numerous narrow strips—continuous or many-tailed. The principle of the multiple strips being adopted, the number used in each jacket may be varied—say four, six, or eight. Where the number is greater the width may be narrower. In using these strips it is not essential to entirely cover the front of the trunk. If the splint is continuous and firm at the back a few gaps at the front do not impair the efficiency of the splint, and may indeed have special advantages.

302 Enquiries in the Surgery of the Limbs. The upper flap was vory thin and I feared some of it might slough, but although union and repair were not rapid they were altogether favourable, and a foot was left on which a decent boot could be worn and with which a perfect walk could be made. The tumour was found to be an ordinary fatty tumour, the fat being perhaps a little whiter and dryer than is usually seen in similar tumours as a rule. The cutaneous coverings were thin, and the fibrous investments were thin, white, and dry. Nowhere was there any of the yellow udder-like fat which is occasionally met with in abnormal foetal enlargements. A METHOD OF AMPUTATING AT THE HIP-JOINT. (abstract op clinical lecture.) This youth of sixteen years has had acute and extensive periostitis of the left femur. Several attempts have been made at various times to remove the dead bone, but the results have not been satisfactory. A few sinuses refused to close, the limb remained useless, the hip-joint was involved (the thigh was quite immovable, and no tendons could be made tense under anaesthesia), and the general health was reduced to the lowest ebb. It was clear that the patient if left to himself had not long to live. After much consideration it was deemed desirable to amputate at the hip-joint, and to use every precaution against shock and haemorrhage. But while amputation at the hip seemed unavoidable the incisions were so planned that they permitted any one of three courses to be taken â€¢ exploration and removal of offending bone, or resection of the hip, or amputation of the hip. It is no little advantage of the operation I am about to describe to you that it allows with equal facility any one of these steps to be taken. In this case it was soon seen that amputation at the hip was the only justifiable measure. A tourniquet was put over the external iliac artery, the limb having been exsanguined as completely as

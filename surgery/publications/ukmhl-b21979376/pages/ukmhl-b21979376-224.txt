The contraction which followed was so great that only a small opening remained where a startling gap had been made. No attempt was made (or seemed possible) to restore the nose. She preferred a small black patch to a false nose. Tho prejudice against false noses should in my opinion be discouraged; that a well-contrived one is better than any surgically-made nose with its peculiar shape, peculiar colour and halo of scars is an opinion in favour of which much may be said.

Among other ad- vantages there would be this: a surgeon who could not draw lines with a point of colour would, if conscientious, suspect himself of being unable to draw correct lines with a sharp knife.

Frequently a portion, however small, at one end of the lip, if not at both ends, may be safely left. The extensibility of a small portion of lip is very remarkable. If the angle and the smallest portion of lip can be saved the operation is simple; but occasionally the entire lip, and even a portion of the adjacent cheek, or indeed a portion of the upper or other lip as well may need removal.

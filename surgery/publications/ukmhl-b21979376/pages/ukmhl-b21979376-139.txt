NOTES ON PATHOLOGY. (mostly prom a clinical point op view.) On the Succession of Pathological Systems. In this note the term pathology is applied to the minute or microscopic tissue changes which take place in disease. Pathology in this sense cannot be said to be at present a knowledge of any certitude, or to rest on any certain foundation. This is not because the ablest minds have turned to other pursuits. The workers at pathology have been, and are among the acutest of observers and the deepest of thinkers. Nevertheless, pathological systems are short-lived. At this very time we are under the spell of a new, startling, and complete system of pathology, and the enthusiastic or the young delude themselves into the belief that we have at length reached pathological truth. In diagnosis and treatment our knowledge grows from one step to another; in pathology our supposed knowledge is forgotten, or swept away, or reversed. Treatment is an evolution; pathology is a series of cataclysms. Living men, still young, have heard during one generation, discussions on “ exuded lymph,” “ molecular blastema ” “ formed and germinal matter,” “ proliferation of cells,” and “ migration of leucocytes,” as the true explanations of diseased processes. They have probably believed in each in its turn. Some, before they die, will believe in a few more systems. In clinical pathology, and in such pathological knowledge as we can acquire by the unaided senses, and by reasoning, we make certain, if not rapid progress. Diagnosis improves treatment, surgical treatment, at least of late, has made marvellous strides, but a singular spectacle presents itself as far as pathology is concerned; fact is ahead of theory; practice has outrun precept; we are curing ailments before we know what they are. The dressing of wounds never before received so much attention, and every science (except that of microscopic pathology) is called in to assist. Surgeons

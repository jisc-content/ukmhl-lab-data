PLATE I. Fig. 1 shows the application of counter-irritation, in a halo or zone around a carbuncle, or boil, or abscess, or patch of erysipelas, or cellulitis. In this plate and the next, iodine liniment (or pig- ment) is assumed to be the irritant. Fig. 2 shows a mode of establishing counter-irritation in mammary abscess. The counter-irritation may be confined to the inner side of the arm, or to this and the infra-clavicular region. The inner side of the arm should be more freely covered than the diagram suggests. Fig. 3 shows a horse-shoe of counter-irritation around a bubo, or inguinal abscess, or inflamed inguinal glands.

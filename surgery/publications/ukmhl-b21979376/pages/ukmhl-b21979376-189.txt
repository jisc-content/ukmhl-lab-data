THE VARIETIES OF ULCERS. The object of the present enquiry is to show, what has been before in some degree suspected of many, that all ulcers are the result of diathetic or constitutional states. It is contended, moreover, that there are only three ulcers commonly seen ; namely, the syphilitic, the eczematous, and the strumous. They are stated in the order of their frequency. I speak of ulcers properly so-called; of those diseases in which a circumscribed loss of integument (its whole thickness) is the principal condition. There are many ulcerations which are not, and correctly so, classed as ulcers; such, for instance, are those which follow operations, injuries, abscesses, carbuncles, burns, escharotics, gout (with concretions), scurvy, chilblains, cancer, skin diseases, &c., &c. These ulcerations are secondary, and might not inaptly be called contingent ulcers. The “varieties” of ulcers of our text-books are numerous, and, to deal with them impartially, it is perhaps best to resort to alphabetical justice. “Acutely inflamed,” “cold,” “cachectic,” “ exuberant,” “ eczematous,” “ gangrenous,” “ haemorrhagic,” “healing ” or “healthy,” “indolent,” “inflamed,” “neuralgic,” “phagedasnic,” “oedematous,” “senile,” “scorbutic,” “sloughing phagedaenic,” “ sloughing,” “ strumous,” “ syphilitic,” “ ulcer of enervation,” “varicose,” “vicarious,” “weak,” are the names given by those writers who are at the same time both conscientious and perplexed. The majority of authors are content to give a few only, as the healing, indolent, inflamed, phagedaenic, sloughing, and weak. The observations of several years of hospital out-patients has led me to regard the peculiarities on which the ordinary classifications are based as merely accidental complications. Indolence, venous varicosity, limmorrhage, inflammation, slough- ing, &c., are merely complications. They are not the essential conditions of the origin, or progress, or even the existence of any ulcer.

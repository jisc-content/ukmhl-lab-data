21 Enquiries in Surgery Generally. to get the full reduction in temperature. The reaction was somewhat irregular, owing, apparently, to the highly emotional temperature of the patient—an Irishwoman. More than once she said she was going to die. We could detect no ground for such fears but elevation of temperature: in short, increased fever followed. The case recovered.

The locality of the pain and tenderness and other symptoms appeared to point to injury to the liver. The table shows marked and very slowly subsiding reaction. The case was left progressing. The cases which I have brought forward, and others which I have carefully examined, suggest the following conclusions as regards the use of the thermometer in shock. 1. The temperature in the fever of reaction should rise shortly after the injury or operation, but with antiseptic treatment this need not be more than one or two degrees. 2. When the temperature, especially after being low for some time, rises above 103°, to 105° or 106°, a fatal termina- tion is to be feared. But moro commonly, in death after injury, the temperature fails to reach to these degrees.

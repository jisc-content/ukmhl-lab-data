PART II. ENQUIRIES IN THE SURGERY OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Clinical Lecture on a Case in which the Trephine was Successfully Used for a Punctured Fracture of the Skull; and its Bearings on the Rules for Trephining. The remarkable case before yon, in which life and intellect were clearly saved by the use of the trephine, offers a convenient opportunity for taking a general view of the utility of trephining. This young man, B. D. (aged 20), was awaiting his turn to enter a theatre when a slate from a roof (forty feet high) fell on to his head and severely injured it. He walked to the hospital next morn- ing with a scalp wound a little above the middle of the right parietal bone, which contained brain-substance, and which was affected by respiratory movements. Examination brought to light a compound, cut, comminuted, and depressed fracture. There was marked hemiplegia on the left side, more especially in the forearm and hand and in the ankle and foot. The tongue when put out was directed to the left side. He was taken into the hospital, and within an hour the trephine was used. Eight pieces of boue were removed, varying in size from a little less than a sixpence to a little larger than a shilling, with, in addition, a strip of felt hat and a separate strip of paper lining, both the width of an ordinary blue slate, and an inch in length, and both deeply embedded in the brain-substance.

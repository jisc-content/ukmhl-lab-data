300 Enquiries in the Surgery of the Limbs. may excite no suspicion even for a long time, but gangrene follows. Abscesses and sloughs, and combinations of the two are the most dangerous, and they destroy life after the fashion of senile gangrene, even if the gangrene—at least the blackness and foetor of gangrene—does not actually appear. CLINICAL NOTE ON A CASE OF EMBOLISM OF THE FEMORAL VEIN INDIRECTLY DUE TO LICE. This case is one of a singular character. A man of dirty habits was admitted into hospital with oedema of the whole of the right lower limb. The femoral vein was converted into a firm cylinder several inches long. The surface of the limb was covered with scratches, a great number of which were highly inflamed. Careful inspection disclosed the fact that body lice were present in great numbers. There can be little doubt that the peristent scratching gave rise to inflammation, and that the scratching being still continued, the minute coagula of the veins of the inflamed districts were dislodged, and conveyed fortunately no further than to the femoral vein, or possibly the external iliac veins. The danger of embolism, from dislodged coagula, in inflammation, is a strong argument in favour of rest. The following case, which came under my notice, is probably not rare:—A man with erysipelas of a lower limb was taken some miles in a vehicle to a parochial infirmary. In less than twenty-four hours he died with the pulmonary artery filled with coagula. A CASE OF LARGE CONGENITAL FATTY TUMOUR OF THE TOES AND FOOT. About three years ago I had occasion to remove a large fatty tumour from the foot of a hospital patient—a young, intelligent, and pretty woman of about eighteen. The case was peculiar and I have not seen or heard of one like it.

THE TREATMENT OF SURGICAL INFLAMMATIONS. Introductory. Frequency op Surgical Inflammation. The Inflammatory Process the same in all its Manifestations. Varieties of Treatment. Should be One Method. It is a remarkable circumstance that although the number of iuflammatory diseases outnumber all others put together, the treatment of inflammation is characterised by uncertain opinions and multitudinous remedies. In this enquiry it will be contended that the inflammatory process is, in the main, one and the same process, however various its localities, complications, stages, and results. But, if there be one process, there ought to be one clear line of treatment. I believe experience and reason alike show that a group of measures may 'with advantage be used in all cases. It may be said, once for all, that inflammation, generally, is spoken of here. There are inflammations, not only of a specific character, but inflammation in which the specific element is usually paramount. In syphilitic inflammation the syphilitic factor is more important and needs to be treated with more directness than the iuflammatory factor. It is so also with the rheumatic and gouty, and some other inflammations. Specific inflammations will not now be spoken of, although it would be well to remember that when the inflammatory action, as such, becomes a predominating feature, the remedies best adapted for removing simple inflammation may be added to those which are intended to combat the specific element. Neither is it intended to speak of the accidents or complications of inflammations which for special reasons require operative or local relief. Wheu inflam- mation of the air passages threatens life from suffocation, air must be let in by operative methods. When inflammation is due to mechanical conditions these must clearly be removed.

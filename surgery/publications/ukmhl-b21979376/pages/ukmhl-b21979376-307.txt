I have had many opportunities of showing you cases of epididymitis following urethral disease. The disease is a common one, and its causes are many—almost too many to count. It would be easy to run over some half a hundred, and yet leave a few unmentioned. Urethral disease following and resulting from inflammation of the epididymis is, on the other hand, rare; it has few causes, and is not yet at all recognised. I show you here a case of urethral discharge, which followed traumatic inflammation of the epididymis. This young man was in good general and genital health. He had never had gonorrhoea. His urethra, meatus, and prepuce were perfectly healthy when he came into the hospital. He received a violent kick on the left testis, and came in two days afterwards with some ecchymosis in the scrotum, and severe pain, tenderness, and swelling, which were clearly seated in the epididymis. On admission, the cord was not thick, nor tender, nor painful. The day after admission, I myself found part of the cord greatly thickened—the thick- ened portion running up from the testis, and gradually subsiding just below the outer inguinal ring. The second day after admission, the swelling of the cord had passed into the canal, which was now full and tender. Two days later a urethral discharge, neither abundant nor scanty, and R

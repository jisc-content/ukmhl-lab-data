126 Enquiries in Surgery Generally. but still more remarkable case, in which both the forearms were alike. It seemed to me reasonable to suppose that, there being a more or less common origin to the vessels of all the structures of the radial half of the fore-arm, one large trunk supplied a naevus and another gave a uniform enlargment to the bones. This disposition of vessels was, it may be conceived, established at such a period of foetal life that a much larger vessel led to the formation of a bigger bone. It may be asked why the bones of the right face were not enlarged in the case of integumental hypertrophy apparently due to old naevus. The answer is not only clear but tends in some degree to confirm the view now taken. The vessels to the bones of the face are distinct from those which supply the integuments of the face. It is not necessary to discuss here the changes which take place in untreated nmvoid growths. Whether inflammation, slight or moderate, took place in the above case or not is perhaps not easy to say, but inflammatory complication in neglected naevi is not unusual.

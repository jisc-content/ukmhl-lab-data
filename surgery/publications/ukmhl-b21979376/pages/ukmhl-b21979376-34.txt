The poor woman had been the subject of joint-disease (caries of the knee-joint) for several years. There were indications o£ the atheromatous diathesis, and suspicions of fatty change in the heart. The resulting shock was not severe; but reaction was late, and never marked; and she sank on the tenth day. Her nervous system was weak, excitable, and unhopeful. The thermometric record is most instructive, and unusual in the low temperature which preceded and followed shock. Indeed, shock from psychical causes seems to have been present before the operation; and this probably was the cause of the less marked change after the operation. I may remark here, parenthetically, that I have been struck with the fact that shock seems to be a protection against shock. In other words, when shock is induced, either from psychical or corporeal causes, a second operation of such causes during the shock has little effect in aggravating it. The ultimate result, however, is not the less but the more unfavourable, as it is supposed to be seen in “ primary ” operations. Appended is a tabular view of the observations during reaction, in the same case, to its unfavourable termination.

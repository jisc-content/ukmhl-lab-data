PART III. ENQUIRIES IN THE SURGERY OE THE TRUNK, THORAX, AND ABDOMEN. EXTRACTS FROM A CLINICAL LECTURE ON TWO CASES IN WHICH THE PLASTER JACKET WAS USED. 1. On the Use op Pulley-extension in the Application op a Jacket, or op a Jacket and Jury-mast. 2. A rapid and CONVENIENT METHOD OP PUTTING ON A PLASTER JACKET. 3. A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT PLASTER JURY-MAST. I show you to day two cases which illustrate a few modifica- tions tending, I believe, to simplicity, ease, and efficiency in the Sayre-Walker jacket. Iu oue case you see a jacket only on a man with caries of the lower dorsal vertebrae, with which is associated a large psoas abscess. The other case is that of a girl with caries and a sharp curve in the uppermost dorsal vertebrae. She has on a plaster jacket, and united with it a plaster jury-mast, and both were put on while pulley-extension by means of a chin-and-occiput sling was being kept up, In this case the pulley was kept on for a week before the jacket and jury- mast were applied. The jury-mast maintains extension and immobility in the head and neck as completely as the jacket keeps up extension and immobility iu the trunk. The two are also so continuous and strong that the body cannot be moved independently of the head, nor the head be moved independently of the body. There are three principles iu the treatment of spiual diseases which I wish to bring before your notice. They may be considered and applied separately, although in practice they may be frequently used together.

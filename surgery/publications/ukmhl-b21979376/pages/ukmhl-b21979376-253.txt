The mortality and consequently the progress, are, however, graver in cellulitis of the neck. The closer proximity of serous cavities and important organs explain this. The treatment of acute cellulitis at the front of the neck is not encouraging in its results. The ailment is so terrible that the customary remedies for inflammation are almost powerless. At an early stage, or indeed at any stage, the free and repeated application of iodine liniment to the chest, back, shoulders, and upper limbs, in accordance with what I may call “ my method ” will certainly do more good in controlling or diminishing the cellulitis than any other combination of other remedial measures. In the less severe forms of cellulitis of the neck, or elsewhere, counter- irritation over large adjacent surfaces, is the most reliable remedy. When the breathing is involved, or where there is reason to suspect death of deep tissues, an incision iu the middle line down to the trachea, as taught by Mr. Bickersteth of Liverpool, is perhaps desirable. I have resorted to it and I shall probably again adopt it, but I am compelled to say that little hope is to be based on it. When gangrenous tissues more or less surround the wind- pipe and gullet, an incision will not save life. I am not sure that, as in some cases of carbuncles, an incision is not the cause of a further extension of the disease, but where death threatens from suffocation we have no alternative. The general treatment can only be assiduous nourishment, and perhaps iron, quinine, and ammonia, freely given and well diluted. I shall not touch on the question of alcoholic stimulants in the present divided state of opinion. Never- theless, alcohol is still given in the sinking stages of diseases which arc actually brought on by alcohol.

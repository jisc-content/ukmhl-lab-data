60 Enquiries in Surgery Generally. many hours before the .operation, that I might thereby approximate as nearly as possible to early infancy, the stupidity of prolonged disease, or the hybernation of animals. The best protection against shock is a state similar to shock, namely anassthesia to tho extent of sleep for many hours. Dr. Wilks has said that a blow on the head by an expert is as serviceable as chloral. I can only express my belief that a dexterous blow on the head before amputation of the thigh would give much better results than amputation of the thigh during the vigorous exercise of volition and ideation. With regard to treatment,.—When the profound forms of shock are before us I believe that extreme external heat may be most readily converted into or take the place of nerve force. Chossat placed pigeons that were apparently dead from starvation (a kind of shock) in a chamber of hot air. They were soon able to stand, and shortly seemed to have apparently little the matter with them. When restored to an ordinary temperature (the cool air so much the rage with ventilationists just now) they died in a few minutes. The most formidable variety of shock we have to deal with is relapsing shock. After an operation or injury followed by feeble reaction, shock again appears—for the most part an indication of visceral complications. I often feel grieved to think that in cases where surgery is powerful to save, our patients die from structurally diseased kidneys, liver, heart, or lungs.

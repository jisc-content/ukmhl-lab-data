THE CONSTANTLY MOIST ANTISEPTIC SPONGE DRESSING. It is the object of this enquiry to show that a sponge of suitable size, shape, and softness, put directly on a wound (operative or other), properly adjusted and kept constantly moist with an antiseptic fluid, is a surgical dressing which has many advantages and few disadvantages. The way in which the constantly moist and antiseptic sponge dressing is used is briefly this. A sponge, soft, trimmed, and moistened, big enough to overlap the area of the locality operated upon or injured, is put directly over and in contact with the parts. It is kept on with the desired pressure by means of a few neat turns of thin bandage or long straps of adhesive plaster. Holes are next cut in the bandages or straps to give free access to liquids. A medicated liquid, which may readily be made strong- enough to prevent septicity, and weak enough to prevent skin irritation, should be poured every thirty or forty minutes into the sponge through the openings and at un- covered margins, if there are any. The dressing must be kept moist night and day. A large vessel of suitable fluid, and a little jug which can readily be dipped into the vessel, should be always at hand. The sponge may be left, no reactionary haemorrhage or other accident interfering, many days. When it is desirable to repeat or readjust the dressing, the same sponge may be cleansed, antiseptically moistened, and applied in a similar manner. This dressing, so conducted, gives rest, splintage, and protection; it maintains position of parts, and prevents pain. It affords any desired pressure for adjustment, or drainage, or arrest of haemorrhage. It not only continuously cleanses and drains, but it maintains active antisepticity or medication. It may be made the medium of maintaining any temperature. It may be applied for a moment, or it may be left for a week or a fortnight. In simplicity it is unrivalled.

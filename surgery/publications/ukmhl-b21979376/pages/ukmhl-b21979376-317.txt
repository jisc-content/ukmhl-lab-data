It is, perhaps, the only operation, which, while wholly effecting its object, does not require the patient to lie in bed. The prepuce first on one side and then the other, is divided, skin and lining, by probe-pointed scissors to the extent of a quarter of an inch. The prepuce is then partially retracted, exposing on both sides a quadrilateral space of lining membrance, which is divided by a second snip on each side.

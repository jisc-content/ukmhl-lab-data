Reaction was rapid and sharp, and recovery favourable. The case was one of strumous osteitis affecting the head of the humerus, of three years5 duration, numerous suppurating sinuses having been present for eighteen months.

This and the other cases illustrate the disturbed relative frequency of the pulse and respiration which is very characteristic of shock. The cause no doubt lies in the direct influence which a violent impression on the nervous apparatus exercises on the respiratory function— an influence more or less independent of the condition of the systemic and pulmonary circulations. The table shows the reaction, at first gradual, and then rapid, which was formerly commonly seen in cases where the general health was moderately good, and the recovery favourable before the antiseptic epoch. A tedious, irregular, and protracted febrile condition followed, which, nevertheless, slowly tended to the recovery which ultimately followed. B

Enquiries in the Surgery of the Limbs. 293 as a rule very old, necrosis only. The risk that is run is, of course, lardaceous disease. In the young this risk should be unquestionably avoided, or at any rate clearly pointed out. In my experience, lardaceous disease, from prolonged slight suppuration, is extremely rare in middle and late life. Anomalous Hip Disease in Young Women. Text books of surgery, and indeed the literature of surgery generally, contain little information about a class of cases of a curious character, but which, though not common, are perhaps not extremely rare. In these latter days of pulley and splintage they are probably disappearing. A young woman (I have seen three or four casesâ€”all young women) with irregular symptoms of hip disease, takes to her bed. The limb does not always take a typical position, but it is usually flexed, the knee is bent too, the other lower limb is flexed so as in bed to adapt itself to the affected limb. Gradually every joint in both limbs becomes rigidly fixed and painful. All movements are extremely painful. Some parts of the limbs waste, some become oedematous. It soon becomes difficult to say which joint is affected, or whether more joints than one are involved. After many months or even years of helplessness and confinement to bed, some improvement sets in. Some of the joints are moved a little. With much persuasion and assistance, a few steps are taken with crutches. The improvement goes on slowly, but in time it probably goes on to a considerable degree. I say probably, because I have not been fortunate enough to be able to follow auy of these cases to the end of their long and wearisome course. In these cases of obstinately flexed, rigid, and painful joints, I have not met with any in which suppuration occurred. In one case oedema at the upper and outer part of the thigh was so marked that I suspected deep sup- puration, and ffiiade a deep exploratory incision, but with no result for good or evil.

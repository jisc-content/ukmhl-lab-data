228 Enquiries in Surgery of Trunk, Thorax, 8f Abdomen. troublesome than hernias, and are safe from the dangers of strangulation ? I would divide the recti muscles near, or close to, the pubic bone. Here the transversalis fascia and subperitoneal fat are thick and would confer complete safety on the operation. I am not sure that it might not be preferable to divide the inner pillar of the inguinal ring. With a finger in the canal might it not be possible to do this subcutane- ously after the manner of tenotomy ? More or less bulging would assuredly follow. For the hernia is substituted a pendulosity, inconvenient it may be, but not dangerous. Now in making this proposal I am not reasoning on fanciful bases. I have seen several women after pregnancy or pregnancies presenting â– partial pendulosities of the abdomen. Some of these have been of extreme size. Some have been vertical widely separating the recti, others have been large transverse pouches between the umbilicus and the pubes, bulging just below the falciform edge of the posterior wall of the sheath of the rectus. These pendulosities are the salvation of child-bearing women. They take the place of hernia and under no circumstances are they ever strangulated. With or even without abdominal belts, these women do a great deal of hard work. (See Plate VII., Figs. 3 and 4.) FATTY CHANGE (AND FAILURE) OF THE MUSCULAR WALL OF THE GUT, AS A DIRECT AND INDIRECT CAUSE OF INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION AND DEATH. For several years past, I have from time to time seen cases in which, with perhaps no premonitory symptoms, continuous vomiting and tympany, lasting one, two, or more days, have been followed by death. While these symptoms appeared in some cases to come on spontaneously, in others, and 1 think more frequently, they followed some abdominal or pelvic operation. The cases, as a rule, happened in fat persons, in persons with large abdomens, in persons with

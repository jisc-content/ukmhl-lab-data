PART I. ENQUIRIES IN SURGERY GENERALLY. ON SHOCK AFTER SURGICAL OPERATIONS AND INJURIES. (the HASTINGS ESSAY.) Shock may be defined in general terms as a peculiar condition of the animal system, characterised by depression of all its functions, the result of a powerful impression applied to the nervous centres, or to a portion, more or less considerable, of the peripheral nervous expansion. After the several operations of the nervous system, and the agency of external forces in relation thereto, have been referred to, as well as the question of the interchange or correlation of the forces generally, vital and physical, it will be desirable to attempt a more specific definition of the condition resulting from the effects of injuries or operations, known as shock. The primary effect of any impression which gives rise to shock is exerted in the great majority of cases, but not in all, directly on the nervous centres; the same impression, however, acts secondarily on all the organs and structures of the animal organisation. Such impression acts partly through the agency of the nervous apparatus, which is brought into close relationship with every part of the animal economy; but another and important, perhaps the most important, manner in which the effects of shock are made manifest, is through the impaired power of the heart and circulation A

In this manner the tube is efficient, self-retaining, and admits of movetnent and cleansing—withdrawal is unnecessary. The spiral wiro prevents compression, and the rubber casing is more comfortable—the two together secure a maximum of advan- tages. The same tube shorter and with suitable fastenings is also well adapted for use where a single opening only is made. I refrain from discussing here the question of Listerism. In private practice and with little assistance, a cushion of slightly moist carbolised tow over the tube is convenient and efficient. Capillary attraction for discharges is much more active with moistened than with dry tenax or tow. NOTES ON DISEASES OF THE UMBILICUS. Gonorrhoea of the Umbilicus.—I do not remember to have seen any reference to such a condition, but an indisputable example once came before me in the out- patient room. The case was in a woman of thirty; she was perhaps the dirtiest woman I ever saw. She had vaginal gonorrhoea at the same time, and her clothing had probably conveyed the discharge to the umbilicus which was smooth, brightly red, but not ulcerated, and discharging a copious, thick, greenish yellow pus. The surgical moral was this : a cicatrix, and not a recent one, and probably thin portions of skin may become the seat of gonorrhoea. Gondylomata and Warts of the Umbilicus must be rare; a deep, moist, dirty, umbilical scar is an essential foundation for such appearances. I lately saw a case in a young woman in which flat, moist, condylomatous discs existed side by side with the branched gonorrhoeal wart. In some of the prominences it was difficult to say which characters predominated, those of the branched wart, or those of the flat' condyloma. Gonorrhoea and syphilis were both present on the genitals.

Enquiries in Surgery Generally. 25 so much less certain and decisive, that opinions formed on this basis possess only a relative value. If six able and experienced physicians were to feel any given pulse, and were iuvited to write a description of it, they would give six accounts, not two of which would closely resemble each other. The sphygmograph alone gives a description clear, accurate, and beyond dispute. The importance, then, of obtaining the sphygmographic characters of the pulse in many deviations from health is too obvious to require comment. The trace which I have given of the pulse in shock is peculiar, and differs from any other condition of the pulse. This trace was taken half an hour before amputation below the knee. The roundness of the junction of the lines of ascent and descent denotes an atheromatous state of the arteries. The next trace was taken in the same case under the influence of chloroform. It is of extreme interest, from the increased length of the line of ascent, caused partly by diminished tension of the walls of the vessels, and partly, no doubt, to the increased propulsive power of the heartâ€”a fact quite opposed to the popular view of the effect of anmsthesia. The preceding three short traces were taken with difficulty on the operating table in the same case. The first was taken immediately before the application of the saw, the second during the action of the saw, and the third immediately after the bone was divided. The latter two exhibit marked shock from the action of the saw. Two or three minutes later, the above was taken, which

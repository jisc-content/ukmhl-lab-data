98 Enquiries in Surgery Generally. Caries of vertebra1.—The great majority of these cases are now so satisfactorily treated by Sayre’s jacket, that the consideration of counter-irritation in their treatment is less urgent than it once was. In rare and exceptional cases, such as those where the jacket cannot be worn, or where the jacket fails to arrest the progress of the disease, the actual cautery should not be forgotten. The Treatment op Inflammatory Diseases op the Respiratory Organs. The benefit of a thread seton at the back of the neck in ozoena is so great, that I have treated it separately on another page.

Although not inflammatory, this condition is treated with more advantage by counter-irritation at the back of the neck than by any other method. With this should be combined elastic pressure; a silk velvet band, with elastic webbing let in at the back, does very well. Bronchocele rapidly diminished in size by counter-irritation at the bach of the neck.—Eliza W., aged 16, came to hospital with a moderately-sized bronchocele. A wide oval patch of iodine at the back of the neck reduced the bronchocele two-thirds in one month. Bronchocele cured by counter-irritation at the back of the neck.—E.

Ordered the enlarged gland to be painted every morning with tincture of iodine. This treatment was continued for some weeks with no apparent benefit. I then directed the whole posterior surface of the neck to be painted with the tincture. In a few days, there was a marked diminution

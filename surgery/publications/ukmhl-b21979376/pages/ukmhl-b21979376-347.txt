A case of apparent absence of the Femur.—I was asked by the medical adviser of the family to see a baby of a few weeks old, with apparent absence of the right thigh. The knee seemed to be slung from the hip, and to be on a level with the perinseum. There was then very limited movement in the part. On making a very careful examination, with the assistance of a little chloroform, I came to the conclusion that the femur was present, but that it was broken into rather small fragments, and these were drawn up by muscular action and constant intra-uterine movements into an irregular spherical mass. The fragments seemed to be in the soft parts which served the purpose of a sort of pudding bag, and were seated between the acetabulum and the head of the tibia, which was two or three inches distant. It is unnecessary to say that no treatment was suggested until the baby was active and strong enough for some mechanism, which might make standing and walking possible. Suppurative Periostitis without Necrosis.—Probably this happens more frequently than is suspected, because it is not unlikely that many deeply-seated collections of matter are due to more or less transient and unsuspected periostitis. In an abscess over the ilium in a girl of seventeen, I felt bare bone when the abscess was opened, but the abscess quickly closed, and the opening healed and remained so. It may fairly be concluded that no bone permanently lost its life. In a girl with a sinus of several months duration, over the lower and inner end of the shaft of the femur, I found on exploration apparently dead bone. I was able to get a glimpse of bare bone, which was of a brown colour. I predicted the need of oporatiou at a not remote date. T

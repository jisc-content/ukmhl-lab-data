16 Enquiries in Surgery Generally. does not usually fall below 97° Fain*. The fever of reaction, so far as I have been able to observe, differs from “ medi- cal ” fevers in the temperature which it reaches prior to a fatal termination. While ordinary fevers reach a temperature varying from 106° to 110° just before death, the fever of shock, under similar circumstances, reaches a temperature only of 100° or 102°. Those cases of reaction are always the most dangerous in which the temperature keeps low, and especially at the early periods of fever. It must be acknowledged, however, that the current views of the relation of fever to septic agencies threaten to modify our opinions on the value or need of febrile reaction from shock. It is claimed for a strictly antiseptic method of treatment of injuries that it prevents a rise of temperature. I append a few cases in illustration of the several con- clusions I have brought forward. I shall give a tabular view of the cases, and comment upon them as I proceed. My observations, although mainly directed to the thermome- tric aspects of the cases, will extend to such other peculiarities as may seem to justify remark.

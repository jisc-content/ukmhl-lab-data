On the other hand, in a very small cyst a single thread, moistened and kept in one hour, will suffice. Another class of cases are those of simple vaginal hydrocele, in which the injection of iodine and other ordinary methods of treatment are unsuccessful. An interesting case will best convey what I wish to say. A young man had a moderate sized hydrocele. Trocar puncture, and acupuncture repeated a few times failed, and consequently iodine tincture (undiluted) was injected. In a few weeks the collection had reached its old size. A silver wire seton was then put in; while in, the cyst remained empty, but its removal was followed by reappearance of the fluid. I then, at three o’clock, passed through the cavity a double silk thread at two spots. In a few minutes, when all the fluid had oozed out, I drew the threads, moistened with iodine liniment, into the serous cavity. I directed him to repeat the process in an hour. He was so anxious to get well—he was shortly to be married—that he moistened the threads four times in six hours. At midnight the effects had become so sharp that he was glad to remove the threads as he had been directed. He remained at home one day only, and was shortly well. I venture to believe that no kind of hydrocele will resist this method of applying iodine, and consequently that the _ setting up of suppuration, even as a last resort, can rarely be necessary. In certain thin walled cysts, for cysts which cannot be removed, this method of treatment may perhaps be used with advantage. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SURGERY OF THE PENIS AND URETHRA.

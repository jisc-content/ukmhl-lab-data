PLATE II. Figs. 1 and 3 show modes of effecting counter-irritation in inflammatory diseases of the shoulder or knee. The intensity and the extent of the counter-irritation must be determined by the locality and amount of inflammation. Fig. 2 shows a mode of applying iodine irritation in axillary abscess, or inflamed glands, or other inflammatory disease. Fig. 4 shows a mode of applying counter-irritation around a node, or other inflammation. The irritation may be effected in two stripes, one on each side of the node, or, in a node of the tibia, the whole of the back of the leg may be covered.

The cicatrization was the only means by which we could then have told which breast had been affected with abscess. “Patient informed me that she had not had the slightest pain or uneasiness since I had applied the iodine, and had slept well every night. I may add, that her gratitude was beyond description.” Remarks.—I have given this case in the words of Dr. Hodge, and simply remark that it is not very infrequent for abscesses in the breast and elsewhere after they are opened to remain hard and painful, and depressing to the general health, probably because the inflammation which first led to the abscess still continues.

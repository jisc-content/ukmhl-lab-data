of urine. Ten years ago I had a larger number of each the probable diminishing frequency of SURGICAL OPERATIONS. For several years I have been leaning to the opinion that tho amount of surgery, and especially of operative surgery, in proportion to the population is growing less and less. The diminution is probably relative, not absolute. It occurs within definite limits, at least it does not affect equally all branches of surgery. But ’curiously enough the general range of surgery has extended, notwithstanding that its relative totality has diminished. What are the grounds of this opinion ? Let me first say, it is founded generally on no slight effort to discover (avoiding suggestive or leading questions) what is going on in hospitals now, and what went on ten and twenty years ago. I do not go backwards more than twenty years because 1 wish to speak of those things only which I have seen. I have carefully weighed the views, reports, and papers of hospital surgeons; I have listened to the statements of many hospital surgeons whose observing powers, memory, experience, and reputation are unquestioned; I look at the character of the cases which now fill hospital beds, and I recall the cases which filled the same beds ten years ago and twenty years ago. Let me speak now of the grounds which I have avoided. I have not looked at private practice, which is based purely on personal qualities, and which grows or fades on quite personal grounds. I have rigidly disregarded my own ex- perience, both hospital and private. I have—this may seem singular—drawn up no statistics. I give none; why, I shall say shortly. Let us listen to a representative, cultured, but imaginary surgeon. Ho says: “ During the last twelve months I have had in hospital practice fewer amputations and excisions of joints, fewer strangulated hernias, fewer lithotomies, fewer punctures of tho rectum or other operations for retention

10 Enquiries in Sv/rgory Generally. In the third category, then, those in which the mind, more or less,, and sooner or later, influences the result, the causes are very numerous; extensive, even though superficial, burns; wounds 'which injure large portions of skin, and ex- tensive injuries of the soft parts generally; compound fractures of large bones, especially of the thigh; crushes of the limbs, and amputations also, especially of the thigh; the traumatic gangrene which occasionally follows injuries of the limbs; the great majority of severe injuries on the battle field (where, in spite of bravery, there is also dread and anxiety); severe operations of any kind where there is much appre- hension before an anaesthetic is given, or where it is imperfectly or not at all administered; injuries and resections which open the large joints, particularly the knee; injuries to the thorax or thoracic organs, heart, or lungs; injuries which implicate the abdominal organs, especially the liver, stomach or intestines, or wounds which merely penetrate its walls; intestinal obstruction, especially from mechanical causes, as internal or external strangulated hernia, intus- susception, and twists. Irritant poisons, it has been well remarked, act in a similar manner to burns or irritants on the surface. Poisoned wounds and the bites of poisonous animals are often the causes of severe shock; injuries of the spine, crushes of the testicle, rupture of the eyeball, rupture of the bladder, rupture of the urethra, and extravasation of urine; haemorrhage, intense and persistent pain—pain being always relative, and dependent on the nervous suscepti- bility of the individual. Injuries of the head are among the most important causes of shock, and will be again referred to as giving rise to peculiar modifications in the manifestation of its phenomena. Those causes which act purely through the medium of the psychical functions are the more powerful emotions—joy, grief, anger, and fear. These, in rare cases, cause death; but in most cases it must be remembered that the violent emotion affects some already diseased organ, as the heart or brain. The antagonism or suspension of nerve-foi’ce will, however, again receive attention in the pathological examin- ation of the question before us.

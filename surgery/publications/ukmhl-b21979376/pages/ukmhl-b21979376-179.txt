The superficial depression was probably due to some oedema, so slight that long continued pressure left a figure of eight pitting, which only very slowly disappeared. Ordinary pressure with the fingers or a pencil produced no pitting. A Case op Gummatous Disease op the Nose SIMULATING MALIGNANT POLYPUS EXTERNALLY, AND SIMPLE Polypus Internally. We had recently, in one of our surgical wards, a woman with a singular deformity of the nose, of a character and history which I have not seen or heard of in any other case. At the same time, I willingly admit that there is no part of the body in which gummatous products may not be found. The history of the case was briefly thus:—Mrs. P., aged 30, and a widow. In early life was subject to chronic glandular swelling and ulceration in the neck. At 16, these left deep and lasting cicatrices. At 21 she married, but had no children. Six years ago she lost her husband, at which time she began to suffer from discomfort and ob- structive breathing in the left nostril; she was supposed to have polypi, and says she was operated upon more than once, but that the operations gave no relief; a seton was then put into the nostril through the cheek below the inner angle of the left eye, and brought out at the nostril.

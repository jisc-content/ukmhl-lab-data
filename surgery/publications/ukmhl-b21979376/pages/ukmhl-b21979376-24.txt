8 Enquiries in Surgery Generally. muscular tissue of these structures or ou the vaso-motor nerves.” Now, the frog is furnished with a ganglionic system, and the nervous system generally is proportionately large; yet, in the important experiment just described, a violent injury to a limb which was completely paralysed produced not the slightest effect on the heart or circulation generally. Possibly, opportunities may occur in the future of ascer- taining in the human being the result of injury to paralysed parts. Thus, shock may result from the agency of causes which operate on the nervous system primarily, or, in a limited number of cases, from causes which act primarily on the muscular tissue of the heart. But, still taking an anatomical view of the subject, there is another manner in which shock may be produced; and that is, by the operation of gradual cold, which appears to act equally and directly on all the structures—nervous, vascular, muscular, and others. I pass now from these introductory considerations, which it will be essential to bear in mind, to the more practical aspects of shock, to the causes, and the phenomena, and the varieties, and the modes of termination of shock, as they present themselves to the surgeon. Causes. The causes of shock are very numerous, of very various characters, and diverse actions. They canuot well be classed under one category; nor is it necessary to detail every separate variety of injury, or the intensity or mode of its operation. All the causes of shock may be classed uuder four heads. 1. Those which act on the corporeal organisation. 2. Those which act on the psychical functions. 3. Those which act on both the corporeal and the psychical entities in equal or unequal degrees. 4. The fourth head comprises cold, which, although fully admitted by physiologists, has curiously escaped the atteutiou of surgeons.

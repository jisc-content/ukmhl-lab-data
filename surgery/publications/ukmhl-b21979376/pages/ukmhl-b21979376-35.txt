Enquiries in Surgery Generally. 19 Tabular view of the case of Eliza S., showing the Temperature, Pulse, and Respiration, during reaction, to the fatal result. Pulse. Resp. Temp. First day 96 25 97.0 Second day 120 26 98.4 Third day 116 24 99.0 Fourth day 120 22 98.8 Fifth day 128 24 101.0 Sixth day 124 22 100.4 Seventh day 120 25 101.0 Eighth day 126 24 101.4 Ninth day 124 22 101.0 Tenth day (death) 124 22 9S.4 I regret that, in this case, only single thermometric observations were taken each day. The morning and evening variations, however, are less marked and more uncertain in the fever of reaction. Death probably followed prolonged shock, in a system unequal to bear it. Tabular view of the case of Aaron B., aged 4, showing the Temperature, Pulse, and Respiration, shortly before, shortly after, and also during the early periods of Reaction which followed, the operation of Lithotomy (lateral method). Recovery. Pulse. Resp. Temp. Before operation 100 20 98.8 Fifteen minutes after operation Six hours after operation 130 26 98.4 99.8 Second day, morning 120 20 100.0 Second day, evening 140 20 103.0 Third day, morning 136 22 100.2 Third day, evening 130 22 102.2 Fourth day, morning 116 20 99.8 Fourth day, evening 100 20 100.8 Fifth day, morning 96 20 99.4 This case shows the effects of the operation of lithotomy in a moderately healthy boy of four. The temperature does not get below 98Â°. Reaction is seen to be quick and high, with also quick subsidence. The morning and evening variations are more regular.

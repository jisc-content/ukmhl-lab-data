Enquiries in Surgery Generally. 171 If there be a decrease iu the sum total of operative surgery, what has caused it ? Higher education of our profession and higher education of the public. Less eating, less drinking, less syphilis, more care of limb and life in every way. Greater attention to hygiene, clothing, food, air, warmth, diet and exercise. Where men's folly and neglect have caused diseases, men have striven to relieve them. Unfortunately, where nature (so-called) has sent the diseases, men have been powerless to check. Men save men; nature kills men. We may unreservedly congratulate the public that, through our exertion, it rests its inflamed bones and joints before it is too late, it puts a truss on its hernia before strangulation comes on, it keeps its stricture pervious, and avoids retention. I hope I am not alone in the opinion that there is a gradual diminution in the total of operative surgery. If there be no real though relative diminution there ought to be, or we must speak less of the great work we profess to be doing.

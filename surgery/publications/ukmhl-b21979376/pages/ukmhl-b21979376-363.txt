Enquiries in the Surgery of the Limbs. 305 indeed in amputations in other localities. The cut surfaces being moistened with terebene, the large sponges were kept constantly moist with the same antiseptic liquid. These kept up deep adjustment, gentle elastic pressure, cleanliness, antisepticity, and rest. When the sponges were removed the stump was as clean as a newly-washed face. It seems a paradox, perhaps, but the moist antiseptic sponge is con- stantly washing and cleaning, at the same time that it is constantly maintaining perfect rest and immobility. The second figure suggests the principle of the operation—not the immediately ensuing retracted state. Since giving the above lecture (the case was published in the Lancet, vol. 1, page 405) I have had several other cases, and many other surgeons have performed the operation—some have publicly recorded their cases and their opinion; others have written to me privately. The Nottingham hospitals have had a large experience in the method, and my friend and colleague, Mr. West, has published a case. It is not more than true to say not only that the general verdict is in its favour, but that already it is more frequently performed than the older operation. I may add that further experience leads me to modify slightly one detail—it is of not very great importance—but I take more decided steps in retracting the skin (with the knife) before the muscles are divided—and this, whether the bone be enucleated first, or the circular sweep be made before the lower part of the shaft is bared, or, at any rate, is removed from its bed. I conclude by again repeating the principle of the operation :' enucleate the bone where it is most thiuly covered; cut across the soft parts where they are smallest; do not touch the bulky soft parts at the inner and upper parts of the thigh.

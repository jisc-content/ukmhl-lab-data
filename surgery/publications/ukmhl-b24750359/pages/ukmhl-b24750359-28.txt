24 gether by the Bide of the meteorological conditions ; hut I had what to me was an advantage, the teaching of experiment, directing me steadily towards the light. In one direction Dr. Hewson has arrived at a new inference which I could not arrive at from the materials at my command. He connects, as I have done, fatal pyeemia with low barometrical pressure and moisture of air. On the other hand he connects death from Sirrgical "shock" with the opposite atmospherical conditions ; but, as deaths from shock are comparatively rare, we are at one as to the sovmdness of the rule of performing operations when the barometer is rising. I seize, with un- usual pleasure, the earliest opportunity of recognising the labours of Dr. Hewson and those others of our Pennsylvanian brethren upon whose researches his deductions are based. I had feared that the views I ventured to set forth in my lecture would have to wait long before they received corroboration. To find that they have been independently advanced and sup- ported in another country, and on a plan of observation so unprecedented, is, therefore, a gratification as great as it was unexpected.

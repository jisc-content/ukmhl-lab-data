into a sea of troubles if ■we were to think of tliem only. We may have, in fact, different results in different seasons, because there may be and are differences in the same seasons "which ■will rule and govern results. We are bound, therefore, to enter into details, and are forced to inquire what is there in some seasons that should lead to important differences in the mortality from those forms of disease 'which are marked by fever or increment of animal heat. My idea is that, on purely physiological grounds, we have reason of the simplest physical kind for that increase of temperature, sometimes fatal, which succeeds the performance of a Surgical opera- tion of a severe character. I think the fever is due to re- sistance of motion. We have seen that whenever the animal temperature is raised there is danger, unless there be established a compensation by radiation, and specially by evaporation of water from the body. Now, when we come to consider the influences of atmospherical condition in relation to mortality, we find a series of direct agencies leading to interference with the process of evaporation when the mortality is high. Let us, in example of this fact, take the external conditions of the year 1868 at the height of 160 feet above the level of the sea. Tear 1868. Temperature, mean. First quarter . 29-845 82 652-3 41-4°FahT. Second quarter . 29-869 73-3 536 55-8° Fahr. Third quarter . 29-773 70 626 63-9° Fahr. Fourth quarter . 29-669 88-3 644-3 45-1° Fahr. From this table let the eye be carried back to the tables and facts of mortality which have already been given, and the mind wiU then appreciate the special meteorological characteristics which run with the lower and the higher mortalities. In a physiological point of view we see in these conditions of air all that is necessary to account for the attendant results. Low barometrical pressure, excess of humidity of air, and a temperature low, but not low enough to compensate for increase of heat by arrest of oxidation or by abstraction of heat.

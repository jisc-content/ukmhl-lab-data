21 simple natural conditions favourable to his operative -work. What these natural conditions are may be stated under a few separate heads.

The time is favourable for operation— (a) When the barometer is steadily rising. {b) When the barometer is steadily high. (c) When the wet-bulb thermometer shows a reading of five degrees lower than the dry-bulb. {d) When, with a high barometer and a difference of five degrees in the two thermometers, there is a mean temperature at or above 65° Fahr. T/ie time is unfavourable for operation— {a) When the barometer is steadily falling. (4) When the barometer is steadily low. (c) When the wet-bulb thermometer approaches the dry- bulb within two or three degrees. (rf) When, with a low barometrical pressure and approach to unity of reading of the two thermometers, there is a mean temperature above 45° and under 55° Fahr.* I have said before, and readily repeat, that these rules are approximative only; but I venture to affirm that if in our large Hospitals careful observations were carried out bearing on the question of mortality in relation to meteorological conditions, the rules would be proved as substantially correct. I believe, further, that if the results of operations performed in those places where the air is dry, the temperature uniformly high, and the mean barometrical pressure high, were compared with results obtained in other places where the opposite general conditions obtain, the correctness of the rules would also, in the main, be substantiated. * For particulars as to method of reading the instruments in the Medical meteorological cabinet, I would direct the reader to Mr. Glaisher'e admirable Mttle work entitled " Hygrometrieal Tables," published by Taylor and Francis, of Red Lion-eom-t, London. I would also return my thanks to Mr. Glaisher for having most kindly read for me the " rvjvise " of this lecture.

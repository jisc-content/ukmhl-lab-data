22 A ■word in conclusion respecting the mortality of operations in patients of different ages. We know as a general truth, that the mortality after great operations is lower in the young than in the advanced in life. In one operation—lithotomy—we have fairly discovered the rate of difference. The reason of the differ- ence seems to me inteUigible enough. In the young the tissues of organs are elastic, the organs are more faithfully acting in accord, the excretory power is free, the muscles on which the organic life depends are vigorous, and the body generally is not embarrassed with non-conducting fatty substance. In those who are advanced in life the conditions are not the same ; the tissues are firm, some organs are failing in power, secretion is less active, the heart and respiratory muscles are feebler. In the young, consequently, there is capacity for compensation; in the thoroughly formed body there is less capacity for com- pensation to meet resistance.

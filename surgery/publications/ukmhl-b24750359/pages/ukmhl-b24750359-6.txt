2 hard to approach a subject of greater importance, so it is necessary to approach it with equal caution, modesty, and decision; for if the views to be advanced are in the main correct, they -will not only give the Surgeon, in very simple rules, an account of the best seasons for operating, but will offer the means of largely reducing the fataKty of some operations, the means themselves being simple, inexpen- sive, natural, true. If I have appeared to have been reti- cent on this subject too long, the reticence has been due to sense of responsibility ia putting forward the details of a reform so large as that which is now in my mind. I have feared lest the charges of enthusiasm and innovation might be levelled with success even against a correct demonstration, (since these charges cost their authors no labour, but form rather an idle pastime), and I have waited therefore to releam and to feel reassured. I wait now no longer, but proceed sustained by no feeling so powerfully as that those to whom this lecture is addressed are sure to appreciate justly what is to be adduced, and to accept favourably even an approxima- tion to the truth, on a subject so vast as that before us at this moment. And, in the first place, let me say that the study we are entering upon has a general bearing on disease and its preva- lence. The simplest, the most natural of all subjects for study, it has been ignored for the most abstruse and unnatiiral studies. We observe great outbreaks of disease, and we look for their primary cause : says one, it is " epidemic influence;" says another, it is " germs, organic germs;" says a third, it is "malarious air," and so on, each having a theory and adding to it some learned reason, or so-called practical inference or moral, and all omitting to inquire what may be the action, in regard to causation, of common changes of atmosphere combined or uncombined with natural physiological changes in the living organism. The study we are now upon touches on the omission I have thus noticed. It brings us face to face with simple natural agencies in relation to their effects on our animal motion, and thus it really brings us face to face with the first causes of disease, all of which are simple natural agencies.

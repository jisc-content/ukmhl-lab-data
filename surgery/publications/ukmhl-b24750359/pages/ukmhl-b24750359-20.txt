Fio. 2.—A, barometer ; b, dry-bulb thermometer; c, wet-bulb thermometer. Indeed, I can induce increase of temperature in an animal by submitting it to ozone at a temperature above 70°. But I would not press this point further, because of the uncertainty of tests for ozone. The fact nevertheless of the concurrence of ozone periods with seasons which are favourable to fever, or increment of animal heat, ought to be remembered. The direction of the wind is connected, in observation, with

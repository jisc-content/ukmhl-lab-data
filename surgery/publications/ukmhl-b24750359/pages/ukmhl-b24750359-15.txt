Thus we see tliat in respect to these diseases, the congeners vdth Surgical fever, the mortality reached its highest in the years named at the period of the fourth quarter. In further illustration of the same truth, let us turn to the Eegistrar-General's summary for the year 1868, and from this we glean the following table :â€” First Second Third Fourth Quarter.

But I have one series of facts which is entirely to the point, and which is peculiarly valuable because it admits of comparison with the general death rate from dis- eases allied to Siirgical fever which has been recorded above, and because one great operation is concerned and one operator. In the year 1868 Mr. Spencer Wells performed the operation of ovariotomy fifty-four times. In January, February, and March, he performed the operation sixteen times, with a residt of three deaths within the fifth day after the operation. In the months of April, May, and June, he performed the opera- tion thirteen times, with a result of two deaths, one of which was within two hours, and therefore would not reckon in our research, and one death in eighty hours. In July and August he performed the operation five times, with one death on the third day. In October, November, and December, he per- formed the operation twenty times, -with a result of eleve7i

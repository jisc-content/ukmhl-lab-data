ADDRESS ON CLINICAL SURGERY. Clinical Surgery, like Clinical Medicine, is one of the most im- portant branches of a student’s education and examination, and what is of more consequence, it forms a large part of the proper business of a practitioner’s life. It is of the utmost consequence that the time and opportunities afforded for its pursuit should he judiciously utilized and taken advantage of. The study may he conducted in various ways both by teacher and taught, and I believe that a certain degree of variety among the different clinical teachers in one hospital will conduce to the advantage of the student, provided that he remembers that it is the special branch in which he himself must be to some and even to a con- siderable extent his own teacher. My experience as a clinical teacher since the year 1860 has convinced me that so far as I and the students who attend me are concerned, the plan which is sketched out on the last page of this address is the most useful in teaching a class, the numbers of which exceed the possibility of dealing with its members solely on the strictly tutorial plan. I shall not pursue the subject, but* shall shortly state, for the information of those unacquainted with it, the scope and mode of conducting that branch of the curriculum with which I have been entrusted.* The simplest idea of clinical surgery is to be derived from the apprenticeship system, in which a surgeon gives to a pupil or apprentice committed fco his care, or acting as an assistant, the in- formation which is to be obtained in the exercise of his private practice. The student being present in his consulting room when the patients call, or accompanying him in his visits to their sick rooms, receives from his master a familiar account of the nature of the diseases brought before him and the mode of treatment. He also learns how to prepare the medicines required, to apply bandages, and generally gains a fair knowledge of the art of pre- scribing. Such is the ideal of the apprenticeship system.

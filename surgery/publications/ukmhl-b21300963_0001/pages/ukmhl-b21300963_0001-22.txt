4 OliT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, That in confequence of injuries of the limbs, are produced by irritation imparted to the brain, which, by a kind of ]-efl.e6led ope- ration, occafions a greater diforder of fome of the organs of the body than of others, and thus gives a chara6ler and deno- mination to the difeafe *. * Mr. Hunter, wlio, with that patience and Induftry for which hef was fo remarkable, colle£ied and examined all the fafts which he had obferved relative to the fub- jeft of fympathy; has divided it into continuous, contigu- ous and remote. It is the remote fympathies, according to his divifion, of which I am now fpeaking. The obfervations of X)r. Darwin on ocular fpefti'a, and indeed the confideration of the nervous fun£tioj\s in ge- neral render it highly probable that fenfatibri is not pro- duced merely by impulfes made on the nerves, but by means of aftions excited by fuch impulfes, which aflions are' continued to the fenforium. Nervous aftions, then, may take place without the ufually exciting caufes ; fuch anions may be continued through the medium of the reticular communications of nerves, '^nd thus phyfio- Ipgically we may explain the continuous and contiguous fympathies. Anions alfo produftive of fympathetic fen- fations may be fuppofed to take place through the media of ganglia or plexufes. In remote fympathies, however, we muft fuppofe the aftions which originate in an injured or difeafed part of the body to be continued to the fenforiumj- and there to excite the adions of other rieryes, &c.

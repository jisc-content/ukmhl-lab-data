12 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, I could relate numerous cafes in fupport of the inferences, which I have drawn from the preceding hiftory j that local irritation ading on the nervous fyflem may affect the digeftive organs in a very ferious man- ner, and thereby create great general dif- order of the fyftem, which is afterwards alleviated in proportion to the amendment that enfues in the ftate of ' thofe vifcera. Such confequences of great local irritation muft frequently occur to every one j it is therefore unneceifary to adduce more in- ftances to fupport the opinions here de- livered. With refpecl to the treatment of cafes of this defcription it may be right to add, that the primary obje6l fliould .fee.- to produce fe- cretion fi"Om the irritable organs. In the cafe gulation in a cafe of adherent epiplocele, in which a trufs did not keep up the hernia, and the operation was followed by violent peritonitis^ which could only be fubdued by fuch copious and repeated vensefeftion, as endangered the patient's life. Thefe two cafes have made fuch an impreffion on my mind, that I fhould be very aveffe in future to undertake fimilar experiments. 5 which

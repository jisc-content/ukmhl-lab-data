84 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, &C. be doubted, did not fa6ls atteft its utility. I fliould DDt have thought iir:right to have thus related it in detail, but for the purpofe of avoiding repetition in the recital of the cafes which are to follow; and aifo becaufe it feemed right to ftate as explicitly as poffible to the younger part of the profeffion what are the curative intentions in diforders of this nature *. * After I had written the above account of the treatment, which ! had found the mofl fuccefsful in the corre£\:ion of difordered ftates of the digeftive organs, I was much grati- fied by the perufal of Dr. Hamilton's publication on the EfFe£l:s of Plirgative Medicines. I tliink there is a great coincidence in the mode of treatment which I have de- fcribed, and that which is fanctioned by his more extenfive experience. He prefcribes pui'gative medicines to act as eccoprotics, to excite but not to ftimulate the bowels ; and he combines with them generally unirritating dofes of mer- cury. Dr. Hamilton's plan of treating thcfe difeafes alfo accords very much with that of M. Halle, to whofe Me- moir I have referred the reader. ' CASES.

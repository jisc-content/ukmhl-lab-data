This practice is peculiarly proper, when it re- quires a more powerful operation of mer- cury than I have in general defcribed, to control and cure urgent fymptoms *. Such is the refult of the obfervations I have made on the treatment of thefe moft * It may be thought by fome, that I have relied too much in the treatment of the foregoing difeafes, upon the internal adminiftration of mercury, and have not fufHciently tried its effefts by inunction. I therefore think it right to ex- plain, that it feems to me immaterial, whether a mild oxyd of mercury, fuch as fhould be contained in mercurial oint- ment, and quickfilver pills, is abforbed from the fkin or the alimentary canal. I generally find that as much of the quickfilver pill can be taken internally as is neceffary to produce the degree of mercurial afFeftion of the fyftem, which is requifite for the cure of pfeudo-fyphilitic fymp- toms, without in the leaft difordering the fundlions of the digeftive organs â€¢, but on the contrary, with evident benefit by exciting and maintaining the natural and healthy adlions of thofe organs. It is right, however, to add, that the pilul: hydrarg: which I have alw^ays employed, has been procured from the Apothecaries' Hall; and that when it has been ob- tained from other places, its elFefts have by no means correfponded to what I have reprefented of them, eitlier in this, or the preceding volume. vexa-

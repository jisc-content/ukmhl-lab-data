Yet confiderable diforder of the digeftive or- gans does exift, and may continue for many years, without any organic difeafe being appa- rent : it is pofTible, therefore, that fuch dif- order may excite difeafe of the lungs, and thus produce a worfe difeafe in the latter organs, than what exifted in the former. In fhort, the opinions, which I have delivered, cannot be either afcertained or refuted by anatomical refearches alone.

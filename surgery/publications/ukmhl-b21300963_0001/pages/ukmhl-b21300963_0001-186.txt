ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINf how much fuperior the rational is to the em- pirical pra6lice of medicine. After having attempted to Ihew that many non-defcript difeafes arife apparently from the ftate of the conftitution, and that car- buncle and fcrofula are fometimes confe- quences of the fame caufe j it may be en- quired, whether, if tlie fame general diftur- bance of the health can produce fb many va- rieties of local difeafe, it may produce many others, and even every variety. Even in cancer, diforder of the digeftive organs ap- pears to be antecedent to the local difeafe, and aggravated by its exiftence; but whether this diforder be the efi'e6l or caufe of the Conftitutional diathefis cannot, I think, be at prefent determined. • CAS£S.

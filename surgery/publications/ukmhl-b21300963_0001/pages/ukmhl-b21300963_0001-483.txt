RESEMBUNG SYPHILIS. 17! how liable an individual is to err, in form- ing general conclufions from his own limited experience, and confcious that the opinions which I entertained refpefting thefe difeafes were different from thofe of a great number of eminent furgeons, I at firft publifhed my obfervations on the fubje6l in portions ; and the fame apprehenfion as to the pof- fibility of error has now induced me to re- publifh them in a lefs methodical manner than I could have wifhed. I thought this mode would fhew better the rife and progrefs of thofe opinions which I cannot but enter- tain ; inafmuch, as they appear legitimately to be deduced from faa:s. Hid I publifhed &11 I knew and thought, relative to thefe fubjefts under another title, had I called the book additional obfervations on venereal difeafes, or on progreffive and remittent fyphilis, it might have been better received, becaufe it might have been more accordant to the notions of others. Yet in whatever way I might have reprefented the fubje6t the the difference would only have been in the manner of difplaying it; there would have been none in the matter to which it related, as that confifts of actual occurrences in practice.

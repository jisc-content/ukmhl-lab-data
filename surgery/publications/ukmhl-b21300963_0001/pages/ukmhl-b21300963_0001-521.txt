OF THE URETHRA, &C, 2og in them may occur from conftitutional caufes, and more apparently from a diforder of the digeftive organs, I need not then urge the propriety of our endeavouring to keep the latter organs, as nearly as pollible, in a ftatc of health, whilft we are endeavouring to relieve the difeafes of the former by local meafures. Of the beneficial efFefts of fuch condu6l, I could relate many inftances, but it does not feem neceflary to detail cafes in proof of fo felf-evldent a propofition. I have explained in the firft volume, my ideas of the mode by which relieving diforders of the digeftive or- gans, relieves and cures local difeafes j and in. local difeafes of the pelvic vifcera another rea- fon may be fuggefled for the benefit which is obtained. It has been obferved, that in difor- ders of the digeftive organs, the lower part of the inteftinal canal is frequently moft affe61:ed. Irritation in the reftum muft affect the plexus of nerves, from which not only that inteftine, but the pelvic vifcera in common derive their energies ; and thus it may lead to a fimilar participation of difeafe.

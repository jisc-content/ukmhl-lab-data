RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. Ill being my intention. I merely ftate, that when the primary fores differ materially from the ordinary chara6lers and progrefs of fyphilitic chancres, that they may fairly be fufpecled to be of a different nature j and that in ge- neral the conftitutional fymptoms will be found equally to deviate from the progrefs of fyphilis, and confequently to require a dif- ferent mode of treatment. I proceed to relate fome cafes of this defcription, and to give an account of the conftitutional fymptoms fubfequent to thefe kinds of fores, in a few cafes, that the reader may judge of them for himfelf.

This probably was the opinion of his furgeon, as he merely recom- mended cleanlinefs, and a poultice, until the fpreading of the fore induced him to ufe mercury.

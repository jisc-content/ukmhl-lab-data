AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES, 21J of the digeftivc organs are impaired and diftarbed, I confider this diforder as the caufe or efFe6l of a more general derange- ment of the fyftem at large. When it feems to be the caufe, and when it can be fpeedily corrected and removed, then the relief and cure of thole local difeafes which may have taken place, is in many inftances fo fudden and furprizing, that I think it impolTible to confider the diforder of the general health and the local difeafe, in any other relation but that of caufe and effect. The cure of local difeafes by means that cannot be fuppofed to act othcrwife than by correcting errors in the functions of the digeftive organs, incline me to differ in opinion from thofe who confider the local difeafes alluded to, as the effect of impurity of the fluids, and to coincide with others, who confider them as the refult of general irritation, frequently induced by that of the abdominal vifcera. When I fee the fame local difeafes removed by the fame means, though more flowly.

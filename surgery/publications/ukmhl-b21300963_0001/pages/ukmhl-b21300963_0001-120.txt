102 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, extent in order to induce the abforption of depofited fubftance; thefe meafures muft aggravate that diforder of the general health, upon which, in many inftances, the nervous affeflion depends. My ol^e^l, in the recital 'of the foregoing cafes, is to point out a caufe of paralyfis in particular mufcles, which from its locality would, I fufpeft, be generally attributed to fome local diforder of the nerves of the afFe6l- ed part, and therefore be treated erroneoufly. If my opinion of the nature of thefe cafes be corredl, they can only be fuccefsfully treated by means which operate upon the conftitution in general. I have particularly recommended that our efforts fhould be di- re6led to correft any errors that may exift in the fun6lions of the primae vise, for reafons that have been ftated in the preliminary ob- fervations. Of the efficacy of fuch endeavours I have feen many more inftaiices than I have brought forward; indeed the propriety of fuch attempts feems fo obvious, that I doubt not but they will be made, and the effefl of them will, by that means, be generally demon- ftrated.

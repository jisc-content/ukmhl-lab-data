RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. Thofc infe(5lecl fores which are not fyphi- litic have fuch peculiarities, as have been fhewn in the firft part of this paper, and as they are fo very various, it becomes necef- fary to diftinguifh them from thofe which are fyphiUtic, by accurately noting the pro- grefs of anomalous cafes of the latter difeafe. It is extremely difficult to form any corre6t opinions on this fubje6l on account of its in- tricacy, and the almoft impolTibility of ab- ftaining from the ufe of mercury; but it is a fubje6t highly deferving enquiry, and which never can be fairly invcftigated till it be known that the fecondaiy fymptoms arifing from fores may not be fyphilitic, though their appearances cannot be diftinguifhed from fuch difeafes by fight alone. With refpe6l to fores that are not fyphilitic the difficulties of inveftigation are greatly multiplied. If a defcription cannot be given of fyphilitic fores, it feems almoft abfurd to fay any thing of thofe multiform fores produced by infeftious matter, the qualities of which, it is probable, may be varioufly modified, VOL.

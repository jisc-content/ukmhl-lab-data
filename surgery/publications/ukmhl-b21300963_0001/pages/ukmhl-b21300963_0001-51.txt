AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 33 a folid ftool, apparently of the fame fiib- ftance, coloured of a light green from an ad - mixture of bile. He had a natural ftool the next day: his appetite returned, and the uneafy fenfations fubfided. An unhealthy colour of the fseces may further be attributed to fome degene* racy in the quality of the alimentary matter j fuch as may be fuppofed to take place when the digeftive organs fail in the performance of their offices, and different alimentary fubftances are in confequence detained in the bowels, where they may pafs through chemical decompolitions, and re* combinations. But, though I am inclined to allow the full operation of thefe caufes, the following reafons lead me to believe that the colour of the fseces generally de- pends on the kind and quantity of the bile. In the natural ftate of the digeftive or- gans, when there is no peculiarity of diet, and no medicine is taken, the bile alone colours the refidue of the food. The f^ces voided during a ftate of diforder of the di- geftive organs are fometimes partially co- voL. I. D loured i

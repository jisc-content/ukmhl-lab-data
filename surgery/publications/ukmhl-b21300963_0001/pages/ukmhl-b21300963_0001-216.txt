198 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, dily got well by meafures direfted to corre61: diforders of the alimentary canal. That cutaneous difeafes * are much con- nefted with the ftate of the ftomach, is gene- rally known. Hence various medicines have been recommended to corre6l diforders of that vifcus, with the view of removing the more evident, but confequent difeafe of the fkin. The account, which I have given of diforders of the digeftive organs, may lead to a more rational and lefs empirical treatment, and to the morejuft appreciation of the value * It may perhaps Ije right to advert to the diredl and fudden fympathy which exifts between the flcin and the ftomach. In affeftions of the latter organ, the Ikin is dry and cold, moift and cold, hot and dry, or moift and dry j and it fuddenly changes from the one to the other condi- tion, as the ftate of the ftomach varies. When the digef- tive organs are difordered, the irritable ftate of the fkin is manifefted by the efFeÂ£ls pf blifl:ers and other irritating ap"- plications. A blilter produces a tormenting local difeafe, and even a Burgmidy pitch plafter caufes extenfive ery- theiria. Indeed, when the conftitution is irritable, all the modes of counter-irritation, which furgeons employ under other circumftances with fuccefs for the cure of local dif- eafes, are likely to do harm ; and thus thefe curative me- thods obtain difcredit in confequence of their ill-timed em- ployment. and

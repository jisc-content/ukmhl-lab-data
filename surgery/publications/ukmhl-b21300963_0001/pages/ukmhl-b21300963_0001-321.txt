RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 9 the local ufe of a folution of cupr. vitriolat. Wherever mercury has been ufed, it muft be difficult to decide whether cafes are or are not fyphilitic. I think it very clear, however, that the cafe juft defcribed was not of that nature ; and, as to the fores healing fuddenly, it is a veiy common occurrence when no mercury is ufed. For fores which are not ajffe6ted by a local application in their inci- pient ftate, will fometimes heal rapidly if the fame application be made to them in an ad- vanced ftate, when the a6tivity of the difeafe is abated, or its nature changed by its con- tinuance. Though no conftitutional a{Fe<5i:ion fuc- ceeded to the fores induced in the foregoing cafes, yet that the fyftem is liable to be con- taminated by abforption from ulcers of this defcription will clearly appear from the cafes related in the fubfequent part of this paper: and at prefent, to corroborate this fa6t by the teftimony of another, I fliall relate a cafe which was communicated to me by an emi- jient and accurate furgeon in this town.

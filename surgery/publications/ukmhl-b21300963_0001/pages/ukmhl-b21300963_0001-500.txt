ON DISEASES Firft, then, it has appeared to me that a, ftate of inflammation and irritation may take place in the remote part of the urethra to a greater or lefs extent. It may produce in the proftate that peculiar fenfibiUty of the part which I have defcribed > and in the peringeum it may caufe contra6lions of different parts of the canal. Either of thefe affections may be more permanent than the other, evei,i where each part has been equally affe6led in the be-; ginning. This if ate of inflammation and irri- tation is frequently produced by gonorrhc^a, though it may occur from other caufes. If a bougie be introduced injudicioufly, when this difbrder jSril occurs in a gonorrhoea, numerous fpafmodic ftricfures* are met with; the patient becomes alarmed by the difficulty of paffing the inflrument, and by the name of ftri^lures, and confults a more experienced furgeon, who diro6f s local warm bathing, and the application of leeches to the perinaeum, * I have ufed the term fpafmodic ftriftures in the in- difcriminate manner in which it is generally employed, though I am aware that it is objeÂ£i;ionable : a ftricture from fpafm is not a ftrifture ; and a flrifture may be irritable or fpafmodical, or oth^rwife.

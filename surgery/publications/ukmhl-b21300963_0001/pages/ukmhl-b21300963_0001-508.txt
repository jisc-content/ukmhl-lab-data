I pro- 19^ â–  ON DISEASES alfo, it may occafionally arife from the irrita- tion of the laft flrifture. Many patients with ftriclures, who complained much of the fen- fations at the neck of the bladder, at' the commencement of the treatment of their complaint, have afferted, that they felt no unufual fenfations when the bougie pafTed through the proftate, after the ftri6i:ures had been cured. Yet, though I would admit that a tendernefs of the canal of the urethra in the proftate may fometimes arife from its proximity and continuity with the lining of the bladder, or with the laft ftri6ture, I think it more frequently exifts as an original and independent difeafc. It has been ftiewn, that it may render the bladder irritable, and excite contra61:ions in the urethra. Some cafes have been adduced, which fhew that this ftate may exift, and yet the bladder may not be conftantly irritable, but that it may be afFefted by fits. I have alfo met with a cafe where .this fcnfibility exifted in an extreme degree, and yet it feemed to have very little influeace on the bladder. I have likewife* known this irritable ftate of the urethra com- plicated with enlargement of the proftate.

X PREFACE. enabled ihc to add fome nev/ and ftriking fa(5ls to. this edition, it has not fliewn me any* thing that I ought to retra6l or ma- terially alter. This, indeed, muft be the cafe im a book containing only fafls, and opinions not incautioufly deduced from them. Several of the papers contained in ''this volume met with very general and ftrong 6bje6lion, which I confidered as the greateft compliment which could be paid to them. For'if the views which I had taken of various pra6lical fubjecls were different from thole bf'others, and were ultimately found to be corre6f, the greater was the neceffity for their publication.

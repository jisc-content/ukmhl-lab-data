\ 0)F THE URETHRA, &C. 225 ftridures had been touched with kali, and the conftant ufe of bougies defifted from, the phymofis relaxed, and the prepuce could be At length his urethra became fo irritable, that he could fcarcely void his urine, which he was frequently called upon to attempt. ApprehenfiVe of cauftic bougies being em- ployed, he confulted me, and I found I could introduce a fmall bougie without much difficulty ; it halted at fe*- Veral ftriÂ£lures, but with very gentle preflljre it pafled through them. I recommended him to bathe the peri- naeum and contiguous parts with warm water, by means of a fponge, night and morning, and told him, I wifhed to introduce the bougie again after three days had elapfed. He was extremely apprehenfive that the paflage would completely clofe during the interval, and ftrongly remon- ftrated againft fuch inefficient pradlice. On the third day he acknowledged that he pafled his urine more freely, ind the bougie which I had firfl: introduced went through the urethra without impediment. I took one of a little larger fize, and pafled it with the fame fort of refifliance which the firfl: had met with. The warm bathing was continued, and by purfuing thefe meafures for three weeks, I pafl"ed a bougie one-third larger than he had been able at the befl; of times to do for many years. The patient now voided his urine in a large fhream, and not more frequently than is common ; in ftiort he felt himfelf perfeftly well. Since that time, no bouo-ie has been Introduced, except once, annually by myfelf, that he might be aflured that the ftriaures had in no degree contrafted. ^oi"Q.. retraced

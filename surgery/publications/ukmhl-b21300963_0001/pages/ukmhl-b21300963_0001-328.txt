l6 I ON DISEASES CASE V. A young man had a chancre by the fide of the frasnum preputii, which had all the charac-v ters of true fyphilis. It was of a circular form, with a thickened edge and bafe j there were no granulations, and matter adhered to the fur- face.. For this, he took mercurial pills in large quantities, which never affeded his mouth, though occafionally they produced griping pains, and made him feel very unwell. He was obliged at this time to travel pretty con- flantly, fo that he could not conveniently rub in mercurial ointment. When the mercury was taken in fuch quantities as to make him feel ill, and to diforder his bowels, the fore and to repeat, that I have found mercurial fumigations employed in the manner recommended by the Chevalier Lajonette, a phyfician in Paris in I77<5> to be, in the ma- jority of inflances, a more powerful and innocent means of producing a mercurial affection of the conflitution than^ in unÂ£lion or the internal ufe of mercury, and equally cer- tain of radically curing the difeafe for which it has been thus adminiftered. The fumigating powder which I have ufed inftead of Lalonette's is calomel walhed in water, containing a fmall quantity of ammonia. 5 looked

238 ON ANEURISMS. fo imperfectly comprefled, haemorrhage took place during the operation, which, though not dangerous to the patient, proved extremely embarraffing to the furgcon; for in attempt- ing to lay bare the fafcia of the thigh, I di- vided, by the very firft incilion, fo many fmall arteries fupplying the inguinal glands, and alfo fo many veins, that the blood which was poured forth, completely filled the fpace made by the incifion, and overflowed the fides of the wound. The application of the fponge, the ufual refource on thefe occa- lions, was of no avail; for the wound was inftantly filled again, fo that the whole ope- ration was to be done upon parts covered with blood, where the only guide in its per- formance was the feeling. I did indeed fee fome expofed inguinal glands, and found that I had divided two of them in trying to get at the fafcia of the thigh. As foon as I could diftin6lly feel this part, I made a frnall open- ing through it, and introducing my finger, I divided it upwards as far as Poupart's liga- ment, and downwards as low as the aneurif- mal fac would allow me. The pulfation of the artery now ferved as my guide. Laying afide.

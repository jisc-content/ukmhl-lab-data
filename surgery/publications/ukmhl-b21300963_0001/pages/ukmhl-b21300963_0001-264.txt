For nearly two inches above the part which was tied, the lymphatic glands covering the arteiy were confiderably enlarged, having no doubt become additionally fwollen from,- the irritation excited by the ligature. The external furface of one of them next the wound, had ulcerated; and the ulceration penetrated through the gland, and commu- nicated with the artery, as was afterwards mad:^ evident by flitting open that veflel.

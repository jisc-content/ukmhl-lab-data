2o6 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, lives. Neverthelefs the patients feemed to die rather of nervous diforder, than of difeafe of the parts firft affefted. One of the patients died affe6led with apopleftic fymptoms, and five with hemiplegia. â€¢ In all thefe cafes tlie liver was greatly dif- eafed, and the bowels alfo exhibited difeafed appearances. In three of the cafes there was confiderable inflammation of the membranes of the brain; and a good deal of water in the ventricles. In two of them no morbid appear- ance of the brain was difcovered. I have alfo examined a child, who was fuppofed to die of hydrocephalus, accompanied by great ^diforder of the ftomach and bowels. In this cafe the bowels were inflamed, the liver foundj and the brain perfe6lly healthy in appearance; yet there had been fo great a diminution of fenfation and motion, as to leave no doubt of the exiftence of hydroce- phalus. I am aware, that great opportunities of obfervation, accurate attention to the hiftory of difeales, and anatomical exami- nation of fatal cafes, are requifite to enable us to formjuft notions relative to the prefent 4 fubje6l.

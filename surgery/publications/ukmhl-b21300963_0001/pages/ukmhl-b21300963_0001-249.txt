ON ANEURISMS. S^l operator has thus gently infinuated his finger between tlie veffel and its furrounding con- nexions, fo that an inch of its furface is every where expofed, two ligatures may be put under it, one of which is to be carried up- wards, and the other downwards, as far as the artery is detached, and then tied as firmly as poflible. The artery (hould then be di- vided by a probe-pointed biftoury in the interfpace between the two ligatures, but- nearer to the lower ligature than to the up^ per one. In my opinion, large arteries fhould always be tied with moderately thick ligatures, be- caufe we may then draw the noole as tightly as polTible, without apprehenfion of cutting or tearing the coats of the velTel, or of break- ing the ligature. The latter occurrence would in many cafes prove a very embar- rafling circumftance, and it might be very injurious on account of the jerk communi- cated to the artery to a confiderable diftance. Alfo, when an artery is tied with a thick ligature, the compreffion made by it is not fo great as to produce a Ipeedy mortification ai>d reparation of the end of the velfel, io f that

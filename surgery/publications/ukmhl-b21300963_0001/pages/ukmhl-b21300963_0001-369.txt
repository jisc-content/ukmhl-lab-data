By under- taking this talk I ftiall perhaps comply with the wifhes of my other friends, in ftating more explicitly the circumftances which fhould in- duce a furgeon immediately to ufe or ab- ftain from the adm in i ft ration of mercury, and, at the fame time, contribute my mite of obfervation to thofe already oftered on this ftill obfcure fubjed of venereal difeafes.

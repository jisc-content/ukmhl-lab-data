7* ON DISEASES difeafe. This gentleman was liable, to have fores^ break out fpontaneoufly on the pre- puce : they got well readily by bathing tliem with a weak folution of zincum vitriolatum; and I believe that pcrfons who have naturally an irritable ftate of the prepuce are moft ob- noxious to fuch afFe6tions. We muft not, however, impute the occurrence of thefe pe- culiar fores to mere irritability, but to fome ipecific contagion. The difcharge from the urethra in fuch cafes is not conliderable, nor attended with much inflammation or chordee, nor does it increafe in violence; it may therefore be eafily diftinguiflied from common gonorrhaea and its varieties. Sometimes, in a common gonorrhaea, the difeafe fliifts its ground and attacks the fore- Ikin, and fores form about the orifice of this , part. Thefe are of a different nature from the fores which I have been defcribing: their ' furface is generally glofly, not producing ex- liberant new flefli, and their colour is un- healthy.

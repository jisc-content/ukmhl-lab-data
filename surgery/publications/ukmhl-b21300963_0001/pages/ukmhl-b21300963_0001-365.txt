RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 53 have given a little calomel for that purpofe, but not fo as to invaHdate the opinion that the dileafe was not fyphihtic. Having waited, for inftance, -four months from tlie occur- rence of a fore throat with eruptions, and being afTured by the progrefs of the dif- orders that they were not fypliiUtic, I have directed that the compound calomel pills * fliould be taken in fuch dofes as to control the difeafe without weakening the conftitu- tion, which generally difpofes the fores in the throat to heal, but i have taken care to remit the ufe of even this fmall quantity of mer- cury if it feemed to heal the fores too fpeedily j for it feems to me better to let the difeafe exhauft itfclf than fuddcnly to cure it, as in the latter cafe it is very Ukcly to return. In confirmation of this opinion I may men- tion, that, about five years ago, a gentleman applied to me to undergo a falivation for the cure of a fore throat, for which he had been falivated three times, once in each fucceeding f The pill, as prefcribed In the pharmacopeia of St. Bartholomew's Hofpital, contains i grain of calomel, i grain of the precipitated fulphur of antimony, and 2 grains of powdered gum guaiacum.

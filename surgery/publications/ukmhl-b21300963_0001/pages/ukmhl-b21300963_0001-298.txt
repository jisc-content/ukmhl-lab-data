aSo ON ANEURISMS, â€¢ tntion. Upon the wound becoming healthy^ at the expiration of a fortnight, all variations of the conftitution ceafed. I cannot, there- fore, but confider the perplexing circum- ilances that fucceeded the operation, as the cfFe6l of the patient's peculiarity of conftitu- tion, and not as arifing from the operation itfelf, or from the ftate of the limb conte- quent to fuch an operation. A fimilar ope- ration has lately been performed by Mr. Frere, of Birmingham, with fuccefs.'* The patient being healthy; the wound healed without difficulty. Mr. Tpmlinfon, of Birmingham alfo, per- formed a fimilar operation with equal fuc- cefs, fo that it feems proved that the external iliac artery may be tied, in the cafe of a femoral aneurifm, with as little detriment to the limb, as occurs from tying the femoral artery in a cafe of popliteal aneurifm. I lately faw the woman who was the fubje6t of the laft cafe which I have related, and there is no diftin- guifliable difference in the fize or ftrength of the two extremities. CASE

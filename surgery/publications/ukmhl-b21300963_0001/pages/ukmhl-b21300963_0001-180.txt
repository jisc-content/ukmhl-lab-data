As the child was feverifh, he took at firft fome faline medicines in a ftate of efFervefcence, which was afterwards changed for the .lilutcd vitriolic acid. He alfo took half a grain of calomel, every fecond night, which gradually brought about a regular fecretion of healthy bile, and in about three weeks the child might be faid to be well, for his bowels a6ted regularly when no medicine was taken, and the difcharges from them were properly tin6lured with bile. The ufe of calomel was now only recom- mended, if the appearance of the ftools va- ried from the rhubarb colour. The fwollen glands difappeared, nothing but a bread and water poultice having been applied to them. The bodily powers of the child were con- fiderably augmented, and his afpe6t became healthy. CASE

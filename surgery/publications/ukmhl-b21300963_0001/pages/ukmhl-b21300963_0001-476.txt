I 164 ON DISEASES diforders. It feems therefore better to defiil: from the ufe of medicine, when the local dif- cafes are well J and, fhould they recur, to cure them again by an alterative courfe of mer- cury, which appears, from its effects, to be not only innocent, but even falutary. In fome cafes which I have attended, after having cured the local fymptoms by an alterative courfe of mercury, with the addition of the deco6lion of farfaparilla, without producing the flighteft ap]!)arent mercurial effe6l on the patient's conftitution, I have recommended the con- tinuance of half this innocent quantity of mercury for a confiderable time, in order to prevent a relapfe, and in many inftances, this plan of treatment has feemed to fuc- cced, whilft in others it has failed. In fome cafes of pfeudo-fyphilis, one fet of fymptoms will difappear without the ufc of mercury,yet new fymptoms occurring, they will be progrefiivc and deftrudlive fo as to require- mercury for their cure. The reverfe of this alfo happens: one fet of fymptoms feemed to require, and to have been cured by an alterative courfe of mercury ; yet others, fubfequently arifmg, may difappear without its admi- niftration.

Apprized of their nature I generally order for the patients that dofe of mercury, which may be taken without afFe6ling the conftitution, as a difcutient of the hardnefs, and I have known nearly fix months elapfe before it has been completely difperfed. This kind of partial induration is fo different from the progrefs of true fyphilis, that I think it muff be readily granted not to be of tliat nature. It muft however be alfo re- membered, that fores which indurate in all parts are not always fyphilitic. As I have already related two inftances 1 think it un- neceffary to add more.

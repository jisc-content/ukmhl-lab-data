4'2 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, gans takes place, thofe fluids, which produce the changes that the food undergoes in them, are deficient or depraved, and confequently that digeftion and the fubfequent procefles muft be imperfe6bly performed. The liver is likely to participate in the diforder, and the biliary fecretion to be diminifhed or vi- tiated. This circumflance admits of ocular demonfVration; and I have, therefore, confi- dered it, as an evidence of a more or lefs ge- neral diforder of the digeflive organs. A very reafonable objeftion may, however, be made to confidering the derangement of the func- tions of the liver as a criterion of thofe of the ftomach and inteftines; fince the liver is independent of the latter organs, and may be the fubje6l of a diforder confined to itfelf. In fome cafes, alfo, the alimentary canal may be affefted, without difturbing the liver. Such circumftances may happen occafion- ally; but they are not ordinary occurrences, and fhould be confidered as exceptions to general rules, which do not militate againft their common operation. In general, affec- tions of the former influence the funftions of the latter i and the ftate of the biliary fe- cretions

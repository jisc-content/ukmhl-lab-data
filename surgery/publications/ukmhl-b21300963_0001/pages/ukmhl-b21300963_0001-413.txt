This violent a61:ion of mercury never fails to weaken and diforder the conftitution in general; and thus, with its powers impaired, and its functions de- ranged, it has ftill to endure the continuance of the difeafe. The cafes, which I fliall now bring for- ward, are felefled, becaufe I think they Ihew as great a variety of circumftances incidental to thefe difeafe?, as could be dif- played in an equal number of examples. I could have crowded the book with inftances, tending more direftly to illuftrate and con- firm the opinions delivered in it. My objed has, however, been, not to rcprefent the fubje6l as more clear than it will appear \Yi pra6lice. CASE

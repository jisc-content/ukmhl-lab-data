There can be no doubt but that epilepfy may in hke manner take place without any- morbid alteration of the ftru6lureof the brain, or its membranes. Some of the perfons whofc heads were examined, without the difcovery of any difeafe of thofe parts, had been fubje6t to attacks like thofe of epilepfy.

In praftice, thefe require our chief attention ; and if their diforders be corre6led, all nervous irritation frequently ceafes, and health is r?ftored. In many inftances the nervous irritation, which has induced the difeafe, is trivial, and would foon ceafe, were it not kept up by the re-ac- tion of its fecondary fym.ptoms.

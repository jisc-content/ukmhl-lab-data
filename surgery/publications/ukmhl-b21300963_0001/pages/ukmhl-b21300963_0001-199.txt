AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. l8l CASE I. A boy about twelve years old was fent from fchool to London, being fuppofed to have a lumbar abfcefs. There was a confiderable colleftion of fluid beneath the fafcia of the thigh ; but it received no impulfe when the patient coughed. The boy limped in walking as if he had a dif- eafed hip, fcarcely bearing on the afFe£ted joint.

At this time no fluid was difcoverable beneath the fafcia ; no uneafinefs was felt when the joint was comprefl^ed; and the boy could not be prevented from getting up, becaufe he felt as competent to walk about, as before the occur- rence of his difeafe.

He then again became lame, in the fame manner, but not to the fame degree. There was, however, no efFufion of fluid beneath the faf- cia of the thigh.

ON ANEURISMS. that the ligature remains, in general, a fort-» night before it is detached, and therefore, time is allowed for the confolidation of the fides of the veffel prior to its reparation *. When * Doflor Jones, whofe numerous and accurate experl-r ments have thrown much light upon the natural means by which haemorrhages are fupprefled, thinks- that the liga- tures fhould be round and firm ; becaufe fuch cords arc mofl likely to cut the internal coats of the artery. I am folicitous that they fhould be ftrong and moderately large j becaufe as far as I have remarked, large ligatures remain longeft on the arteries before they are detached; and in examining the (lumps of patients who have died after amputation, I have frequently feen the fides of the artery unclofed, even though the ligatures have fallen off from them. Though ligatures when applied to the principal arteries of amputated limbs are fcarcely ever known to flip or be- come projefted from their fituation, yet it has been ap- prehended that fuch an occurrence might take place in cafes of aneurifm, from the greater determination of blood into the arteries of the limb in fuch cafes. To ob- viate fuch an efFe£t, Mr. Henry Cline fuggefted the fol- lowing method of fecuring the ligature in its fituation. His fuggeftion was adopted by Mr. Cooper, who thus de-. fcribea the operation in which it was inftituted: « An incifion being made on the middle of the inner part of the thigh, and tlie femoral artery expofed, the ar- tery was feparated from the vein and nei-ve and all the furrounding parts, to the extent of an inch, and an eyed •nrobe armed with a double ligature, (each cord of which

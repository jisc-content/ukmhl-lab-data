OF THE URETHRA, &C. l^S The CASE IV. A gentleman, about fixty years of age, was afFefted with dyfury, which increafed with violence, thousrh various means were em- ployed during two years for his relief. He voided his urine every fecond hour, or oftener, with great pain and fevere irritation j which continued for fome time after its expulfion. He had fuch a fenfation of heat and uneafi- nefs in the perina^um, that he could not bear to bring his thighs together; and he was obliged to ufe a cufliion, with a vacancy in the middle, when he fat down. He could not ride in a carriage, or even walk out, al- though his general health was good. A moderate lized bougie halted a little at two ftrictyres, and when it arrived at the proftate produced a violent burning fenfation, a vehe- ment propenfity to void the urine, and extreme pain at about two inches from the orifice of the urethra; which part was always particu- larly painful during the time of voiding the urine, and after its expulfion. On withdraw- ing t|ie bougie, which had entered the bladder, its point was found to be covered with blood.

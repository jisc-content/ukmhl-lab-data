The difcafe fubfides, but a new difeale and a6lion commences; a trivial wound frets out into a phagedaenic fore, which is very difficult of cure. The fores, in different cafes, are nearly as various in ap^ pearance, as thofe of which I have been fpeaking. To what are we to attribute thefe diffimilar, perplexing, peculiar fores, if not to irritation occurring in weak and irritable parts ? As the peculiar difeafed actions of thefe fores originate chiefly from the weak- nefs and irritability of the parts, induced by the previous diforder which they have under- gone J foin their advanced flages they frequent- ly prefent the befl inftance, that can perhaps ^e adduced, of a peculiar local difeafe exift- ing independently of conftitutional diforder. It is true they affe61: the health in general; but it may, by attention, be kept in a mode- rately right flate, and yet the fore remains un- amended. The difeafed adions of thefe fores fometimes gradually, and fometimes fuddenly ceafe; when healthy adlions fucceeding, the fore heals. I remember a fore of this defcrip^ tion, to which almofl every variety of drefling had

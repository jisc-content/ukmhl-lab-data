2â‚¬> ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, The changes which the food undergoes in the digeftive organs of the more com- pUcated animals are threefold j and dilHn6t organs are allotted to each of the three procefTes. Digeftion takes place in the flomach; chylification in the fmall intef- tines ; and a third procefs, hitherto undeno- minated, is performed in the large in- teftines. It is probable that in fome cafes,- one fet of organs may be more difordered than the others, and of courfe one of thefe procefTes may fail more than the reft. For inftance, the ftomach may digeft the food in a healthy manner, although the inteftines do not perform their fhare of the changes, which they oiight to efFe6t. The food is converted in the ftomach into, a vifcid femitranfparent fubftance called chyme; and that this change is effefted by the agency of the fuceus gaftricus, is a. point as well afcertained as any in phyfiology. In a ftate of health this converfion takes place without any appearance of that natural de- compofition which animal and vegetable matter would ordinarily undergo in a warm J and

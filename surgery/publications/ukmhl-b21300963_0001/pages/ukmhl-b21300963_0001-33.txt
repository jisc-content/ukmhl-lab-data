AN-D TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 15 tions. There is alfo frequently a veiy troublefome cough. Such fymptoms gene- raliy lubfide when the local irritation ceafes, but fometimes the diforder of the digeftive organs, thus excited, continues and dif- turbs the general health of the patient. If local irritation be capable of diforder- ing the bowels, it feems natural to , conclude that it a6ls upon them through the medium of the brain. If alfo the brain and nervous fyftem fliould be difordered, without any apparent local difeafe, fimilar derangements may be expe6led to take place in the func- tions of the digeftive organs. In cafes, where fome morbific poifon has been ab- forbed, producing effefts fimilar to thofe of fyphihs, we ufually find the irritation of the conftitution which enfues to be accompa- nied with this {lighter diforder of the chylopoietic organs. Whenever, alfo, the nervous energy and general powers of the conftitution have been weakened and difordered by any violent difeafe, as fever, fmall pox, mealies, hooping cough.

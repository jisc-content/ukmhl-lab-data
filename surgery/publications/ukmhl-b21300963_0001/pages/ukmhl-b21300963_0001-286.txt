ON ANEURUiMS. 268 blood had taken place; indeed, could the adequatenefs of the collateral arteries for the fupply of the limb be eftablifhed, it would be proper to operate at an early period of the difeafe. It deferves to be confidered whether, in cafes, where it is probable the blood is become difFu- fed, it might not be right at the time of the ope- ration to open the aneurifmal bag, and j-emove the blood. I fliould, however, be inclined to poftpone this attempt; for, perhaps, no necef- fity might exift, as putrefa6lion might not take place. A few days will determine the degree of life of the limb, and would make a wound lefs likely to ulcerate or flough. Should figns of the putrefa6lion of the blood enfue, or the probability of fuch an occurrence become evident, I fhould think it neceffary to make a fmall opening into the aneurifmal bag for the removal of the contained blood. This being done, if no blood came from the lower orifice of the artery, there would be no ne- ceffity for tying it. CASE

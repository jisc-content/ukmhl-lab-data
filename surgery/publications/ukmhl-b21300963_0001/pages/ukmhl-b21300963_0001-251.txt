ON ANEURISMS. 233^ When an artery is thus tied in cafes of an- eurifm it pofTeflcs its natural furrounding connexions and fupport, and is left loofe, in confequence of its divifion. It appears, in- deed, in moft refpe6ls fimilarly circumftanced to an artery tied upon thd furface of a ftump, and as I never knew haemorrhage from ulcera- tion of the veffel take place after the opera- tion for aneurifm, when it was accomplifhed in this manner, I cannot but continue to pra6lice and recommend this method of fe- curing the artery. That the operation for the aneurifm will fucceed when only a lingle ligature is employed has been proved by ex- perience; but as haemorrhages, independent of ulceration of the artery, fo frequently arife from an inflammatory a6lion of the veflels, was armed with a needle,) was conveyed under "the artery and the probe cut away. The hgature neareft the groin was firft tyed; the other was feparated an inch from the firft and tied alfo j then the needles were pafled through the coats of the artery, clofe to each ligature, and between them ; the thread they carried was tyed into the knot of the ligatures which had been already fecured around the veflel : and thus a barrier was formed in the artery, beyond which the ligature could not pafs."

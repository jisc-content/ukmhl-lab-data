44 ON THE CONSTITUTXONAL ORIGIN, That the digeftivc organs in general were afFecled in the cafes of local difeafe, which I am about to record, is moft evident; but I am aware that many varieties of diforder may be included in the general defcription of the fymptoms, which I have given. Future ob- fervations may lead to further diftinftions; but I fee no impropriety at prefent in fpeak- ing of the difordered ftate as general j fmce it is probable that no material diforder can or- dinarily take place in one of the digeftive organs, without didurbing the funftions of the others. When digeftion is imperfeftly performed, thefun6lions of the inteftinal canal will foon participate in the diforder of the ftomach. Under theie circumftances, the fecretion of bile will alfo probably become irregular. Should difeafe commence in the large inteftines, as about the re6lum, it dif- turbs the funftions of the ftomach, and fecre- tion of the liver,-and becomes augmented in its turn by its fympathy with thefe parts. Should the liver be difordered in the firfl in-, fiance, the ftomach and bowels may not im- mediately fympathize, although they will probably foon become affefted. Ueel

AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DIS^IASES. 17! pofite fide was far from being in a perfectly healthy ftate j which circumftance appeared to forbid an operation, fince the fame difeaie might take place afterwards in the oppofite breaft. The patient's general health was much impaired, her tongue was furred, her appetite deficient, her digeftion imperfe6l; the biliary fecretion was difordered, and the bowels coftive. I ordered her to take a compound calomel pill every other night, five grains of rhubarb half an hour before dinner, and the infufion of gentian with fenna, fo as to procure a fufficient eva- cuation of the bowels daily. Linen moift- ened in water was applied to the part in the evening, or when it felt painful and heated. This plan of treatment reduced the bulk of the difeafed gland by at leaft one third in the courfe of a fortnight. The patient went afterwards into the country, ftill employing the fame medicines; and was entirely free from the difeafe in three months, though fhe felt occafionally fhooting pains, which pro- bably indicated that her health was not com- pletely re-eftablifhed.

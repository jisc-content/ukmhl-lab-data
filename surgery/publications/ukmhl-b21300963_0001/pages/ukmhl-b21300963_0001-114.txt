9^ ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, Cafes, cafes, and the pupils were generally much di- lated. After the patient had continued in the hofpital about feven weeks, ihe was at- tacked with fever, and died. To this brief account of the fymptoms, I now fubjoin the dille6lion. No difeafed appearances were obferved in the brain, though it was examined with tlie moft particular attention : neither was there any difeafe of the vertebras. No difeafe, in fhort, was obferved except in the abdominal vifcera. The chief morbid appearance, in them, confifted in an ulcerated ftate of the villous coat of the iliurh near to its termina- tion in the caecum. The ulcers were numer- ous, and fituated where the mucous glands are chiefly found. The internal coat of the large inteftines, alfo, appeared inflamed. The liver was healthy in its fl:ru6i:ure. In the gall bladder about one ounce and a half of a light green ferous fluid was found, which had not in the leafl: degree the foapy, or mu- caginous feel of bile.

l80 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, CASE means to put a flop to inflammation are re- quifite; and thirdly, an inflammation de- pendent on conftitutional caufes. This in- flammation is fometimes of an aftive and painful nature, and fometimes of a more in- dolent and chronic chara6lerj but whatever form it may aflume, it is lefs prone to injure the fliru^lure of the joint, and little fufceptible of cure by local meafures, whilft it yields to thofe means which tend to improve the health in general. When a difeafed joint is fo fituated as to become an objeft of examina- tion, thefe circumfl:ances will be fufficiently evident. I am induced to mention them chiefly on account of fuch variety of affec- 'tions occurring equally in the hip, as well as in the other joints, in which cafe the be- nefit accruing from different modes of treat- ment is lefs demonfl:rable to the fight and touch *. * As I know of no treatife on difeafes of the hip in which the difl:in6tion of cafes is made; and as, from what I have feen, I cannot but confider the fubjeft to be very â€¢ irnpoirtant; fo I think I fhould do WTong to forego the prefent opportunity of relating as fuccIniSly as poflible two of a confiderable number that have come.under my obfer- . vation, in order to excite attention to this fubjeil.

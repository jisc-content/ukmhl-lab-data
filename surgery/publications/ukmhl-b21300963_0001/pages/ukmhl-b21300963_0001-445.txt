Some burrowing fores do not Co affect the conflitution as to produce fecondary difeafes, whilfl others do. I have recorded a fpccimen of each, and think it unnecefTary to cite more; tliough I could bring fonvard a confiderable number,.

To me, however, it appears that the moft potent mercurial courfe was inadequate to the cure of the primary fymptoms, and would have been fo to thofe of a fecondary nature, while the latter were readily controulable by an alterative courfe, and in fome inftances got well fpon^ taneoufly.

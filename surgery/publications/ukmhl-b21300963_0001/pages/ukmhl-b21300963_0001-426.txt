ON DISEASES 114 CASE XVI. A gentleman between twenty and thirty years of age, refiding in the country, had an ulcer in the prepuce, which, to ufe the words of his furgeon, had more the appear|- ance of excoriation than chancre ; it was fuc- ceeded by a bubo and ulcerated throat. Fbir each of thefe difeafes he ufed mercury fo freely as to convince fome of his medical' at- tendants that the difeafe could not be fy- philitic; his furgeon faid enough to cure twenty fyphilitic patients. The ulcers in his whilft it fpread on the other. The conftitutional fymp- toms were fpeedily cured by a flight mercurial afFeftion, but they broke out again under a fevere courfe of mer- cury. Many conftitutional fymptoms got well without the ufe of mercury, and when at laft it was employed again on account of the ftubborn nature of the nodes, thefe difeafes yielded to a flight, and were aggravated by a fevere courfe of mercury. The difeafe laftly yielded to an alterative courfe of mercury, fo flight as not mani- feftly to affect the conflitution, and during which, tlie patient got mufcular, fat, and healthy. The fubjeÂ£): of this cafe was a remarkably healthy man, and had before contracted fyphilitic difeafes, which were regular in in their progrefs and cure. Mercury alfo affefted his conftitution in the mode which is confidered moft de- firable for the cure of fyphilis. throat

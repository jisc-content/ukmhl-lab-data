AND TREATMENT OF' LOCAL DISEASES. 39 The cliemical decomporit-ion is attended with the fadden formation of ammonia; yet -if they be examined when recent, they are found to -contain acids which am-monia would neutraUze. The - inference, there- fore, naturally arifes, that this third procefs-, I mean the converfion of the refidue of the aliment into faeces, may, amongft other pur- â€¢pofes, be defigned fo to modify that refidue, as to prevent it from undergoing thofe various chemical changes, which might be ftimulating to the containing organs, as well as injurious to the general health. In a perfe6lly healthy ftate of tlie^ di- geftive organs, probably no chemical de- compofition, even of the faeces, takes places; yet fuch changes happen; in fome degree, without apparently producing any injuri- ous confequences. To -chemical changes we may probably attribute the extrication of inflammable air, and the various and unnatural odours of the faecal matter, which are obfervable in difordered ftates of the .di^eftive vifcera.

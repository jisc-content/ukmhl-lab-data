feESEMBLING SrPHILlS. - 3 duced on the genitals, by fexual intercouife, tvhich are not the efFecls of the Venereal poifon, and that many of them infecl the conftitu- tion, and produce fecondary fym.ptoms relem- bling thofe of that diforder. It may be aiked, however, if thefe difeafes be not vene* real, what are they ? As they are ail the confequence of fexual intercourfe. they may, in one fehfe of the word, be faid to be vene- real. To avoid ambiguity, therefore, I lhall in thefe pages denominate that difeafe which broke out at the fiege of Naples, and which Mr. Hunter has defcribed as the venereal difeafe, by the name given to it by nofological writers, that is. Syphilis; and I fhall call thofe difeafes, which differ from it in their progrefs and mode of becoming well, though they ftrikingly refemble it in appear- ance, by a name importing thefe circum- ftances, that is, Pfeudo-Syphilitic Diieafes. To prepare the mind of the reader to take an impartial furvey of thefe fubje6ts, I think it will be ufeful to make a few pfelimiriary obfervations relative to the probable origih of pfcudo-fyphilitic difeafes.

AND Ti^EATMENT QP LOCAL DISEASES. 203 of tbe funiftions of the:nervous fyftem pro- ducing apoplexy, but alfo partial effects of a fimilar nature caufnig hemiplegia and para- lyfiis, may take place, without any vifible change of ftruclure in the brain. I have met with num.erous inftances of this kind; but could not determine whether the affec- tions were merely nervous, or whether they were produced, or aggravated by diforder of the digeflive organs. I only know, that the patients died affedled by apoplexy, hemi- plegia, or more local paralyfis, without any derangement in the evident flru6lure of the brain. I may alio mention, that I formerly examined the brains of three perfons who died in a comatofe ftate, in confequence of the metaflafis of rheumatifm. In thefe cafes no morbid appearance was obferved in the brain, except fome flight marks of inflamma- tion of the pia mater. It therefore appears clearly to me, that diforder and a confider- able diminution of the nervous fun6tions may take place, without any organic affe6lion of the brain. The perfect recovery of pa- tients, which fometimes happens, after fuch diforders, may alfo be confidered as additional evidence

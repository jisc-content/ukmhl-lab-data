AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 4-9 the fame time, I think it fair to infer, that thefe organs are equally operated on by the fame caufe. Diforders of the brain may afFe6t the chylopoietic organs; and it is well known that this influence is reciprocal. The ftomach is faid to be chiefly concerned in producing thefe effe6ls j but the caufes of the fympathetic afFeftion are probably more general. A fltof paffion has produced jaundice ; and the irri- tation of teething in children frequently fuf- pends the fecretion of bile; fo that the fl:ools are not in the leafl: degree tinged with that fluid. If the head can thus affe6t the liver, it is reafonable to infer, that the liver may reci- procally afleft the head. It is very difficult to form an opinion relative to this fubjc61:; for, in the infl:ances which have been mention- ed, the affection of the liver may take place, only becaufe it forms a part of the digeftive organs, and not from a dire6l fympathy exifl:- ing betv/een it and the head. Still, however, I do not think it unreafonable to conclude that irritation of the other chylopoietic organs may, as well as that of the ftomach, diforder the fource of fenfation. VOL. I. E To

I then pafied two ligatures under it by means of an eyed probe, and drawing one of them upwards, and the other downwards, as far as the fpace would permit, I tied them firmly. The upper li- gature was about half an inch from the os pu- bis, and the lower one the fame diftance from the arteria profunda, which veffel I had dif- tinftly felt before I tied the ligatures. There are, perhaps, few fituations of aneu- rifm where the artery can be tied fo fepa- rately and diftindly as here; the pulfation di- refts the furgeon to the precife fituation of the veflel; and if he only keeps fufficiently clofe to its fides when he paflTes the ligature round, neitlier the vein nor the nerve can be included. I did not divide the artery between the two ligatures; it was fuggefted that it were better not toldoso; and I knew that I could ob- tain all the advantages of a relaxed ftate of the veflTel,

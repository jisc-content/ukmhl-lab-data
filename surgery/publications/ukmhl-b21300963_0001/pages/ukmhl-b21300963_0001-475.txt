RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 165 any relapfe fhould occur, the difeafe could not be fyphilitic, or curable by fuch a courfe of mercury. The cafes to which I allude were thofe of officers and perfons of ftrong conftitutions, in which it feemed neceffary to eftablifh this fadl, with a view to the fubfe- quent treatment of any fymptoms that might occpr. Yet in thefe cafes new fymptoms were manifefted. I have alfo been frequently con- fulted with refpeft to the degree to which a mer- curial courfe fliould be carried, and the time it {hould be continued, that had been inftituted for the cure of pfeudo-fyphilitic fymptoms, which had been miftaken for thofe of true fyphilis; and I have recommended that it fhould be con- tinued to that degree and for that duration, that fhould render a repetition of it unnecef- fary, by proving it to be unavailing, fhould a recurrence of fymptoms enfue. Yet in thefc cafes alfo, either the fame fymptoms returned or fimilar difeafes took place, and in moil inflances thefe returning fymptoms h^ve got well without the ufe of mercury. The cafes alio, which I have detailed, fhew how unavailing the moft potent courfes of mer- cury are, in efFe6ling the radical cure of thefe M 2 diforders.

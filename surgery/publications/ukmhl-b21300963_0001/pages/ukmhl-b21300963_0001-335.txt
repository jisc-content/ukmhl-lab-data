He fhewed his difcafcs to feveral fuj'geons, on whofe opinion he relied, who, without hefitation, affirmed that they were fyphilitic, and that the mercurial courfe had been improperly delayed. Wliilft the patient was looking out for lodgings, in order that he might go through the mercurial procefs, a circumfcribed thick- ening and elevation of the pericranium cover- ing the frontal bone appeared ; it was of the circumference of a half-crown piece; and was, in fliort, what every furgcon, who is guided only by his fight and touch, would, without hefitation, have called a true corona' veneris. I now told the patient that I was ftilf more inclined to believe his difeafe was not jyphilitic, from the fudden and fimultaueous occnri'ence of this node with the fore throat, ^c. Other furgeons thought diltcrently; and I believe this very fenfible and amiable young man imagined tliat his health would become a facrilice if he sny longer attended to my' c opinion.

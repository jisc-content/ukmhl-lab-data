Io8 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, local complaint; for, if there be nothing wrong in the general health to excite or maintain' it, we may reafonably concluv'.e that it was merely local; on the otlier hand, the inefficacy of evacuations in curing the local difeafe would naturally fuggeft the opinion, that it proceeds from irritation, and is dependant on a diforder of the health in general. It iliould be further obferved, that when the local difeafe is of an inflammatory nature, and likely to induce morbid alterations in the ftructure of the affefted parts, ftill it may be maintained and aggravated by dif- order of the digeftive organs. I have very frequently feen patients fuffer fo feverely as to warrant a fufpicion, that local difeafe of the moft formidable nature exiiled; in thefc the ufual methods of treatment were ineffec- tual ; and they recovered fuddenly or flowly, in proportion as the flate of the digeftive organs was correfted. I fhall relate fome examples of the difeafe under confideration, which will enable the reader to identify the eafe, when it occurs in praftice. CASE

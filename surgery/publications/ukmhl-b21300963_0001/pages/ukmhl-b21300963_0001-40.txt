In recent and confiderable affeftions, where the appetite is loft, and the digeftive powers are greatly impaired, the appearances of the tongue are by no means fo ftrikingly un- healthy as in more confirmed cafes, where neither the appetite nor digeftion appear materially deficient. It is probable that a continuance of irritation in . the ftomach may fo afFe6l the tongue, as to render un- natural fecretions habitual to the part, and that thefe exift independently of the original caufe, or may be reproduced by trivial de- grees of diforder.

ON ANEURISMS. from fuch aneurifms. The fufFerings both of body and mind, in thefe cafes, were Ihocking. The patients were unable to move, and the diftenfion of the integuments, and prefTure on the nerves occafioned great pain and irritation. The patients alfo lay apprehen- five and uncertain of the hour when their fuf- ferings might be terminated by a fearful and fatal haemorrhage. I think myfelf therefore fortunate that I was firft, as it were, com- pelled to perform an operation, which I truft, may be found to diminifh the fufFerings, and preferve the lives of thofe afflicted with this difeafe.

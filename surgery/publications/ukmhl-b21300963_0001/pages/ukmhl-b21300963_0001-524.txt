ON DISEASES 212 This treatment was alfo perfevered in for about fix weeks, but with no manlfeft advan- tage. I then put two fetons * through the fcrotum, and continued the poultice at night and a dreffing of fpermaceti cerate during the day. Under this treatment the teftis diminiftied very confiderably in fize, but at the end of two months, the fetons had gra- dually come out, in confequence of the ul- ceration which they occafioned. Shortly afterwards, the teftis became painful, and it enlarged to its former dimenfions, fo that no advantage was obtained from all thefe endeavours to reduce the difeafe. I had fre- quently enquired of this patient refpe6ling the ftate of his urethra, and been as often told that he was not confcious of any diforder exifting in that canal. Now, however, on repeating my enquiries, he faid, that he had , * Setons may be conveniently made and worn in the Icrotum. I firft employexl them in conformity to thofe general principles which regulate our condu(3; in the treatment of local difeafes ; and I have known feveral in- ftances of difeafed teftis, which refifted various local modes of cure, and even confiderable courfes of mercury yield, and get well when fetons were employed. jj remarked

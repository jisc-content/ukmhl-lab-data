AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 73 in fome cafes, that the purgative medicines <.nd fpices diflblved in fpirit and water, have anfwered better than any thing elfe, in pro- ducing a fufficient, but not too copious dif- ' charge from the bowels. Equal parts of com- pound tincture of rhubarb and fenna is the formula to which I allude. When irrita- tion in the large inteftines has been denoted by the mixture of mucus and jelly with the fieces, and fudden and urgent calls to void them, I have advifed oily and mucilaginous medicines as aperients: as caftor oil, mixed with a large proportion of mucilage. My fole object, however, has been to regulate the ftate of the bowels j and when they have been regular without medicine, I have rarely recommended any. At the fame time, I have not been inat- tentive to the error in the biliary fecretion, which exifts in the greater number of thefe cafes. I have endeavoured to correal this error by the adminiftration of fuch fmall dofes of mercury, as do not irritate the bowels, and are not likely to afFe6t the conftitution, eveii though perfevered in for a confiderable time.

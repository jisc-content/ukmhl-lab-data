About half an inch of the artery was want- ing, which had been, as it were, cut out by the ligatures in the firft operation. The fides of the arteries below the part which was tied were thicker than natural, and their internal furface was rough, and of a yellowifli white colour. The arteria profunda was filled with coagulated blood, and had become reduced to lefs than the natural fize.

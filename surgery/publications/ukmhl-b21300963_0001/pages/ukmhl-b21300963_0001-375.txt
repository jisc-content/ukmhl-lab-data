If then we may, for the reafons above ftated, employ mercury without hefitation in primary infected fores, being governed with refpect to the degree and duration of its ufe by its effefts, we ought, as has been fhewn in the preceding part of this chapter, to purfue the reverfe con- duct with refpeft to conftitutional fymp- toms. Here we are required to hefitate, that we may learn the nature of the difeafe pre- vious to attempting its cure.

36 FIRST LINES OF THE sided, and only a discoloured ccdemalous swelling conti- nues, topical applications containing camphor are the best. The vesicles which form should be punctured with a needle, and their fluid contents be imbibed by a sponge. CHAP. VII. OF THE FURUNCULUS, OR BOIL. , ITS SYMPTOMS AND NATURE. A circumscribed, very prominent, hard, deep-red, painful, inflammatory swelling, not exceeding, in general, a pigeon’s egg in size, constitutes the furunculus. It is seldom attended with fever, .except when very- large, or there are several tumours at once. It is the disposition of aboil to enter into an imperfect kind of suppuration. The matter is contained in a cyst, composed of the cellular substance. When the tumour bursts, it does not readily heal on account of this sort of capsule continuing behind. TREATMENT OF THE BOIL. As it seems to be the course of nature that swellings of this kind should suppurate, though imperfectly, and, as an induration constantly remains after an incomplete re- solution of them, v’e ought generally to promote suppu- ration by using external emollient applications. There arc, however, a few exceptions, in which resolu- tion may laudably be attempted. In such instances, vi- triolic acid mixed with honey ; alcohol ; and ol. camph. are recommended as topical applications. In the majority of cases, emollient poultices are the eli- gible remedies, to which henbane, hemlock, or opium, may be united, when the pain is intolerable.

FIRST LINES OF THE 312 probang, a small fresh eel skin, through which nourishment was injected with the utmost convenience. A small hollow bougie, or elastic gum catheter, is what is now most commonly preferred.

XXIV, FOREIGN BODIES IN THE CESOPHAGUS. FOREIGN bodies, which ought to be extracted from the oesophagus, when possible, are such as might create bad symptoms, if pushed downward into the stomach, in con- sequence of their hardness, indissolubility, pointed angu- lar shape, or other hurtful qualities.

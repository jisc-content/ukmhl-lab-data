Violent inflammations of the eyes may terminate in a ge- neral suppuration of those organs, and render the restora- tion of sight totally impracticable. CHAP. XIII. OPACITIES AND ULCERS OF THE CORNEA. OPACITl of the cornea is one of the worst consequences of obstinate chronic ophthalmy. Scarpa distinguishes the superficial, and recent state of the disease, from the albugo and leucoma, which are usually accompanied with inflam- mation, assume a clear pearl colour, and affect the very sub- stance of the cornea. The nebula, or slight opacity, now to be considered, is preceded by, and attended with, chronic ophthalmy. The iris and pupil can be seen through a kind of dimness ; and of course the patient is not entirely bereft of vision. The veins of the conjunctiva, greatly relaxed by the protracted duration of chroiyc ophthalmy, become preternaturally turgid, irregular, and knotty; first in their trunks, then in their ramifications, near the union of the cornea with the sclerotica;* - and, ultimately, in their most minute * See Plate V. fig. l.

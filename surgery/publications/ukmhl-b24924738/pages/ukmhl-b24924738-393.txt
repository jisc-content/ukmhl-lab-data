PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 35\ (he wound is to be left open, and the posture of'the patient is to be so regulated as to make the wound as depending as possible, in order to promote the escape of the effused fluid. In case it is not perceived till after the wound has been dressed, it is directed to remove the means employed to close a part of it, and to place the patient in a proper pos- ture with a bandage applied round the body. Should in- ternal hemorrhage still prevail, there is no application equally efficacious witli cold washes. When symptoms of irritation prevail, attended with local inflammation, pain, and a fluctuating tumour, the extravasated fluid may be evacuated by the puncture of a trocar. When there are no symptoms to denote the exact seat of the extravasation, the employment of antiphlogistic means, a suitable posture, and the introduction of a tube into the wound, are all the measures that can be adopted. For my own part I would restrict the plan of treatment to avert- ing inflammation, as in this circumstance, no bene- fit can be derived from posture, or from a tube that docs not actually reach the effused fluid, and the former must often be irksome, the latter always irritating. A bandage applied rather tight round the body ought not to be omit- ted, as it is a certain mode of promoting that compact state of parts contained in the abdomen, by which the ill consequences of extravasation are so materially dimi- nished . When the situation of the effused fluid is not precisely known, the case is dangerous, but not hopeless. Some- times, by pressing the intestines a little backward from the wound, if it be Urge enough for this purpose, the extra- vasated matter has an opportunity to escape. In other in- stances, it does not find an exit till suppuration has taken place, and the abscess has burst externally. Occasionally it makes its way (by exciting ulceration) into the aliment- ary canal, and is discharged per anum.

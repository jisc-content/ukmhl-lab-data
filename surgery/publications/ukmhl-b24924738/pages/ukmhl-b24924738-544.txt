FIRST LINES OF THE ' 502 other muscles, between the tibia and fibula, including those covering the latter bone. Throughout this extent there are no bulky muscles, which can be made very serviceable in co- vering the end of the stump, and the operator must conse- quently have sufficient skin in tins situation, by dissecting it irom the parts beneath, and turningit backward. On the posterior part of the leg, on the contrary, the skin should never be detached from the large Q'ustrocnc- mins muscle, which, with the soleus, will here form a suffi- cient mass for covering the stump. Hence, as soon as the skin has been separated in front, and on the outside of the leg, the surgeon is to place the edge of the knife in the in- Cisiori of the integuments, and cut directly through the muscles of the calf, from the inside of the tibia, quite to the fibula. Then the flap, formed by the calf of the leg, is to beheld back by tlie assistant, while the surgeon completes the division of the rest of the muscles, together w ith the interosseous ligament, by means of the catling, a kind of long, narrow, double-edged knife. In amputating below the knee, very particular care must be taken to cut every fasciculus of muscular fibres, before the saw is used. Every part being divided, except the bones, the soft parts are next to be protected from the saw, b> a linen retractor, made with three tails, one of which is to be drawn through the space, between the tibia and fibula. In the leg, there are only three principal arteries, re- quiring a ligature, viz. the anterior and posterior tibial, and the peroneal arteries. • \ • AMPUTATION OF THE A JIM, As M. Sabatier remarks, the structure of the arm bears a great analogy to that of the thigh. There is only one bone, round which the muscles are arranged, the deep ones being adherent to the os brachii, while the outer ones ex- tend along the limb, without being attached to this bpne.

FIRST LINES OF THE 176 appearance of the diseased surface leads the unwary prac- titioner (o increase the exhibition of mercury ; and thus the system becomes more and more deranged and debili- tated, and the local mischief proceeds from bad to worse. When chancres spread rapidly by a sloughing process, there is always strong reason to believe^hat the circum- stance is owing to an unfavourable state of the constitu- tion, and irritability of the diseased part. The omission of mercury internally should, in such cases, be tried ; bark, fresh air, and food of a nourishing quality, should be given ; and of all local applications, no one is more ser- viceable than a solution of opium, in the proportion of a dram and a half to a pint of water. Thus the state of the system will be amended ; and, as this happens, those mor- bid appearances of the sore, which depended on general weakness and irritability, will disappear, and then, if ne- cessary, mercury may be given again. An indolent knob, or lump, is sometimes the forerunner, sometimes the consequence of a venereal sore on the penis, and it is very tedious in undergoing any change. BUBOES. Wrhile no venereal matter has been taken up from the surface of a chancre by the absorbent vessels, the disease is entirely a local one. The matter in being absorbed, is very apt in its passage through the inguinal glands, to oc- casion an inflammation and enlargement of them, followed by suppuration and ulceration. This secondary affection is named a venereal bubo. The syphilitic poison may lodge on the sound skin, and be absorbed, without the oc- currence of an ulcer, and a bubo may be the consequence. Buboes are, however, commonly preceded by a chancre; and they more frequently follow sores on the prepuce, than those on the glans. The absorbent glands in the groin are subject to enlarge- ments, altogether unconnected with venereal causes, and

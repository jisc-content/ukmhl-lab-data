I PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 195 days before operating, and of applying leeches and cold saturnine lotions to the articulation. Ihus the joint is brought into a perfectly quiet state before the incision is made. A mild saline purgative should also be previously exhibited. As the cartilaginous body can generally be moved round the joint, the surgeon can chuse the situation for his in- cision. I think Mr. Abernethyâ€™s plan is as safe and com- modious as any method.

The integuments are to be drawn to one side, before the wound is made, in order that they may cover the opening in the capsular ligament immediately after the operation.

The affection is very frequently preceded by se- vere rheumatic affections and local violence. "W hen the fluid is not so copious as to produce very great distention of the capsule, a fluctuation is easily distinguishable.

The disease is commonly not attended with much pain, but there is a degree of rigidity in the joint. Mr. Russd has adopted the opinion, thal some cases of this kind are venereal, and others serophulous, though he has not supported the doctrine on any solid foundation. Hydrops articuli sometimes follows fevers. > TREATMENT. The indication is to excite the absorbents to remove the Q 9

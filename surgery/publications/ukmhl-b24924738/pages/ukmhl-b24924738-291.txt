Under the preceding treatment, the acute stage of vio- lent ophthalmy commonly ceases in about a week. The 'burning heat, and darting pains in the eyes; the fever; and the tension of the eyelids, subside ; while a discharge of thick matter succeeds a secretion of thin serum, or a preternaturally dry state of these organs. A moderate light can now be borne without vast irritation. Notwithstand- ing the eyes may continue red, and the conjunctiva tume- fied, evacuations and emollient applications arc to be aban- doned.

In proportion as the irritability diminishes, the warmth of the collyrium should be lessened, until the application can be borne quite cold.

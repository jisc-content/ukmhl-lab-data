598 FIRST LINES OF THE way through all the membranes -which envelope ttie testi- cle, it either produces a large, foul, stinking, phagedenic ulcer with hard edges, or it thrusts forth a painful glect- ing fungus, subject to frequent hemorrhage. These latter states of the disease are denominated the cqncer of the testis,. , Sooner or later the scirrhous induration extends from the epididymis upward along the spermatic cord, even within the abdominal ring. In the latter circumstance, the lym- phatic glands in the loins usually become diseased; and this extension of mischief, together with the impossibility of removing (be whole of the diseased cord, too frequently deprive the patient of every chance of getting well. It is now well known, that the most simple sarcomatous enlargements of the testicle are capable of assuming, in a very sudden manner, a malignant and cancerous tendency ; and that sometimes the scirrhous induration of the cord makes a rapid progress upward. Hence that surgeon acts with prudence, who recommends an early extirpation of every testis that is incurably diseased, and so deprived of its original organization, as to be totally unfit for the secre- tion of the semen. r Chronic enlargements of the testicle are sometimes at- tended with an accumulation of limpid fluid in the tunica vaginalis, and the disease is then termed hydro-sarcocele., From what I have seen of savcoceles, 1 am entirely of opi- nion with Mr. Pott, that the man who has the misfortune to be thus afflicted has very little chance of getting rid of the disease by any means but extirpation ; and all the time the operation is deferred, he carries about him a part not only useless and burdensome, but which is every day liable to become worse, and unfit for such an operation. As leaving a man with a malignantly diseased testicle, quite unassisted to meet his lingering fate, is a very serious step, all surgeons ought to be well apprised, that every en- largement of the spermatic cord, in these cases, is not of

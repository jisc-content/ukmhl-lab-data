*6 FIRST LINES OF THE man who is suddenly necessitated to part-with bis limb for an accidental injury, while be remains, in other respects, perfectly healthy. The perturbation into which the system is thrown by the sudden occurrence of an alarming local injury, is also urged as an objection to immediate imputation. These objections are, in some measure, well founded; and they ought to be allowed to have a certain weight in all cases where the propriety of amputating is a matter of doubt on other accounts; but I cannot agree that they ought to overrule every other consideration. First, let it be remembered, that in accidents of this na- ture there are only two periods at which amputation can be performed. The first is immediately after the occur- rence of the injury, before inflammation arises, and before a disposition to gangrene commences in the limb. This period only lasts a few hours; and when these have elapsed, the dangers of mortification and death must be laced. 1 o amputate when the limb is swollen, and in a stale approaching to gangrene, would only be to torture the last moments of life. If these immediate perils are got over, and the wound is brought into a state of suppuration, the violent inflamma- tion and swelling abate, and, while the patient’s strength yet remains adequate, the opportunity to amputate is once more afforded. This is another nice point, which demands the utmost discernment. By a prudent perseverance in the attempt to preserve the limb, the patient’s constitution sustains the labour, and success crowns the surgeon’s efforts. But an indiscreet anxiety to save a limb too often proves fatal; and the system, subjected to the ravages of copious suppu- rations, and of painful incisions for the discharge of matter and foreign bodies, sinks beneath the weight imposed Upon it.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 3'3 proved ineffectual. I would only recommend it to be dis- titioners. The authority of Le Dran, Pott, Sabatier, and of a hundred other celebrated surgeons, might be ad- UIn performing the operation, a large opening should be made in the vein, in order that the sudden evacuation of the blood may make the patient faint; for the taxis is ob- served to be particularly successful during a swoon. For the same reason, a liberal quantity of blood should be taken away. Haying bled the patient, it becomes advisable to make another attempt to reduce the parts by the hand: and h taint- ing should occur, this favourable opportunity ought not to be lost. Too often, however, the hernial contents are not to be released from their incarcerated state by such mild treat* rnent. ] calculate, that half an hour would be amply sufficient for putting into practice what has been above recommend- ed, viz. the attempts at reduction by the hand, and bleed- ing. Success not being obtained, I would next recommend the patient to be placed in a warm bath, if one could be spee- dily provided. But though 1 have reduced several her- nia;, while patients have been in this situation, and though 1 place considerable reliance on its efficacy, so perilous does delay appear to me, in these circumstances, that should any great length of time be unavoidably necessary to prepare the bath, I think it would lie most judicious not to remain inactive.

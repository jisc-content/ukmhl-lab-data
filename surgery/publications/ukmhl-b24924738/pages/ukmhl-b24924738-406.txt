3b4 FIRST LINES OF THE an oscheocele. The name oi femoral or crural hernia, is applied to that which occurs below Pouparlâ€™s ligament and 19F most frequent in women. When any of the abdo- nnnal viscera are protruded at the navel, the tumour is termed an umbilical hernia, or exomphalos. The hernial tumours, manifesting themselves below the pubis, near the attachment of the superior head of the triceps and pecli- xeus, are called her nice of the foramen ovale. Sometimes the hernial tumour projects into the vagina, and is there- fore named a hernia of this part. Others, appearing at any other part of the abdomen not mentioned above, are called ventral her nice. One Wi y peculiar case is termed hernia congenita. It exists from the time of birth, and in it some of the abdo- minal viscera,arc actually lodged in tlie tunica vaginalis, in contact with (he testicle. Haller and John Hunter seem equally deserving of the honour attached to the discovery, and explanation of the nature of this particular case. The disease is produced in consequence of a piece of intestine, or omentum, slipping into the tunica vaginalis, before the natural communication between the cavity of (his mem- brane and that of the abdomen, is obliterated in the young subject, In common cases, the contentsofa hernia are always in- cluded in a complete membranous pouch, which is, in tact, formed by the peritoneum. This membrane, every novice in surgery knows, lines the whole cavity of the ab- domen ; and when any viscus protrudes out of the belly, it necessarily carries before it a portion of < lie elastic bag, in which it is naturally included. Such is the simple manner in which a hernial sac is formed. In general, this partis of a thin texture in recent hernias, and of a thick structure in old cases. In an epiplocele, as Le Dran observes, there is nothing to be felt except a doughy softness, which neither abso- lutely yields to the touch, nor very sensibly resists it. The

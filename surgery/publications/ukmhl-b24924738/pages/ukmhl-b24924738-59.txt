PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 59 the living body, and suppuration takes place in Ike inter- space. The result is an entire separation of the mortified portion. , The disposition to mortification often extends a consi- derable way from the part already dead. The coagula- tion of the blood in the large vessels leading to the slough, proves that the mischief is not confined to what is external- ly visible. Hence the united experience of surgeons in all ages lias determined, that no operation, for ibe removal of a mortified limb, can warrantably be performed, before a stop is put to the expansion of the disorder, and a line of separation is seen between the dead and living parts. When the sphacelation is complete, and its progress has stopped, a linseed poultice, containing finely powder- ed and recently burnt charcoal, is a most eligible applica- tion. The cataplasma aeratum, one ot the formulas of St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital, is also one very much approved.* Stimulating antiseptics, such as spir. rim enmph. ol te- rebinth. &c. may diminish the fetid effluvia; but, they are too apt to create a renewal of sloughing, when they extend their action to the living parts. When the inflammation surrounding the sphacelus has abated, the patient should be allowed the most nutritious food, with bark, aromatic confection, wine, and ferment- ed liquors. If delirium should occur, camphor, musk, or valerian ought to be administered, and a blister applied to the head. Opium and the mistura cretacea are tire best medi- cines for diarrhoea. The separation of a slough should always be left as much as possible to nature. The surgeon should only interfere in removing parts entirely detached. It is impossible to say what little violence will often renew the spreading of * R; Farinre Tritici, CerevisiieSpumse Yest dicta*, sing, fijss: Misce. et calwi medico expone, donee etfervescere inceperit.

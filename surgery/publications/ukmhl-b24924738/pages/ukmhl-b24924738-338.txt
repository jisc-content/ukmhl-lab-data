Practitioners in this country are, in general, content ■wnh laying open the tumour from one end to the other ; squeezing out its contents; and removing every particle of calcareous matter that can be felt within the wound.

W hen the substance of a tumour beneath the tongue is fat, as soon as the surgeon has ascertained the nature of the case by an incision, his best plan is to take hold of the tu- mour with a hook, draw it forward, and carefully take it ■ out, by detaching it from the surrounding parts in front vitli a bistoury; and breaking the connexion, on the side towards the raninal artery, with his fingers. This may be safely and easily done, It there should be much bleeding after either of the ope- rations above mentioned, it may be stopped by pressing some lint into the wound.

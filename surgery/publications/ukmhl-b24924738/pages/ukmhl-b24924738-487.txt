PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 445 ihe volatile liniment, blisters, and electricity, are of ser- vice. Retention of urine is, in fact, very often merely a symptom of another disease, and then the removal of the latter generally cures the other alfection. When the bladder can completely empty itself, the ca- theter is no longer necessary. But the surgeon must assure himself by an introduction of the instrument, that this is really the case; for if any of the urine should be allowed to remain undischarged after each evacuation, the quan- tity would gradually increase, and a complete retention take place again. CATHETER. There are flexible, inflexible, and elastic catheters. The common inflexible catheter is a silver tube of such a dia- meter, as will allow it to be introduced with facility into the urethra, and of various figure and length, according as it is intended for the male, or female subject. A common male catheter is ten or eleven inches long. In general, a large instrument of this kind, like a large bougie, will enter the bladder with more ease, than a smaller one, because less likely to be entangled in the lacunae of the urethra. One third of the catheter, towards its point, should be mode- rately curved; the other two thirds, towards its handle, should be straight. The instrument, when gently curved, is found to be more easily introduced, than when it is very much bent. The female catheter is straight, excepting a slight curvature towards its point, and it is about six inches in length. The ordinary flexible catheter is nothing more than a hollow bougie; and the elastic one contains in its compo- sition clastic gum. The two last descriptions of catheters have the advantage of being less irritating to the urethra, and less apt to become covered with calculous incrusta- tions, than silver tubes. They can also be introduced, in

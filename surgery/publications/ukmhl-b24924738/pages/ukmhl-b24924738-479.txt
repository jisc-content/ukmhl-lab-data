The only improvement, which seems proper to be made in this plan, is to employ hollow bougies, or flexible gum catheters, which might be worn longer than common bougies, as the patient could void his urine through them.

Hence, the urine insinuates itself into the loose cel- lular membrane of the scrotum and pemsf The extrava- sation of this fluid becomes the cause of suppuration, when- ever it is diffused, and even of mortification, first of all the cellular substance, and then of several portions of the skin. If the patient surv ive, all these sloughs are detached, leav- ing a free communication between the urethra and exter- nal surface. Every opening, thus produced, is termed a jistula in perineo, Sometimes the urine finds its way into the corpus spon- giosum urethra, becomes diffused through the whole of this texture, even injected into the glans penis, and occa- sions mortification of the parts, in which it is lodged,

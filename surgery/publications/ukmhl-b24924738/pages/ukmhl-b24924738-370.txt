FIRST LINES OF THE 32* vasation of coagulating lymph around the wound shuts up the pavities of the cellular substance, TREATMENT OF EMPHYSEMA. In cases where the air has not escaped from a wound of the lungs themselves, and only a moderate quantity has yet insinuated itself into the bag of the pleura, I see no objec- tion to covering the external aperture of the wound with adhesive plaster. It is true, as soon as the air, already pre- sent, finds an impediment to its escape from the wound, it will be likely to diffuse itself in the surrounding cellular substance. Tq counterbalance this inconvenience, it is cleqr, that in proportion as the air diffuses itself in this manner, the lungs must expand to fill up the vacuum pro- duced in the cavity of the thorax, and the oppression of respiration be diminished. The external emphyscmatou? swelling cannptbp productive of any serious consequences, and can only increase as long as the stock qf air in the chest yemains unexhausted. If the swelling should be very large, two or three small scarifications pray be made, iq order to give vent to the confined air. Jfust before placing the adhesive plaster over the external aperture qf the wound, it is erroneously directed that the patient should draw as much air into the lungs as possible, and retain it there till the plaster has been applied. The air enters the cavity of the chest through the wound at the same time, and from the same causes, as it enters the lungs through the trachea ; consequently the exact moment when the mouth of the wound should be closed, is at the end of an expiration. The difficulty of ascertaining positively whether the lungs are not superficially wounded, so as to furnish a part of the air, may sometimes make it difficult tp decide whether it is right to adopt the foregoing practice or not. Wheq the external wound has been closed, and the difficulty of

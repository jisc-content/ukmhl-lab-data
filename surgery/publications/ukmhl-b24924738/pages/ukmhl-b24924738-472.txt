FIRST LINES OP THE 430 However, in cases When? no bougie can be introduced be- yond the stricture, I am of opinion, that Mr. Home’s plan of treatment is the best; the attempt to restore the pervious state ot the urethra, in these instances, by the formation of .successive eschars, must be attended with less irritation and pain, than any effort to get through the obstruction, by pressing the common bougie so forcibly against th« stricture, as to excite ulceration. method of using the common bougif.

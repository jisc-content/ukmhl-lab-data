On the contrary, the joints are often very stiff, and the feet frequently cannot be placed flatly on the ground, in consequence pf the toes pointing downward. The disease of the spine varies in situation, extent, and degree, being either in the neck, back, and sometimes, though very seldom, in the upper part of the loins; some- times comprehending only two vertebrae, sonic times three, or more. Some patients are rendered totally incapable of walking, at a very early periqd of the distemper : others can manage to move about with the help of crutches, or by grasping tjieir own thighs with their hands. When a weak infant is the subject, and the curvature, resulting from the morbid state of the spine, is in the verte- brae of the back, it is not unfrequently productive of de- formity, by rendering the back humped, and by altera- tions, which the position of the ribs and sternum under- goes, in consequence of the flexure and morbid state of the spine. The general health does not seem, at first, to be materially affected ; but when the affection of the spine has made much progress, many complaints come on, such as difficulty in yespiration, indigestion, pain, a sense of tightness in the

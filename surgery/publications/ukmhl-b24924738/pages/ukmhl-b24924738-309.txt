The little tumour is of the same colour as the iris, \ iz. brown, or greyish, and is surrounded at its base by an opaque circle of the cornea. If we reflect a little on the delicate structure of the itisr ^on the exeat quantity of bloodvessels which enter it, and the numerous nervous filaments which are distributed to it, we shall easily conceive the nature and severity of those symptoms which are wont to attend this disease, how small soever the portion ot the iris projecting from the cornea may be, even when not larger than a pin s head. Pain, similar to what would arise lrom something pricking the eye ; an oppressive sense ot tightness in the whole eyeball; inflammation of the conjunctiva and eyelids ; a copious ef- fusion of tears ; and an absolute inability to endure the light ; arc the symptoms which successively follow this complaint. The pupil deviates from the centre of the iris, towards the seat of the prolapsus, and assumes an oval shape.

TREATMENT OF PROLAPSUS OF THE IRIS. Tn the early stage of this disease some recommend en- deavouring to replace the iris in its proper situation by. means of a small probe, and, in case of difficulty, to dilate the opening- in the,cornea by an incision, just as we are

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 107 are red a,rd tender. The neighbouring glands swell, and assume the spongy morbid structure of the anprnl - rnour. If the patient still survive, similar tumours form in other situations, and hectical symptoms put a period to On examining the affected parts after death, or amputa- tion, the tumour itself is found to consist of a soft sub- stance, somewhat like the brain; membranous partitions intersect it, and there are cells, or abscesses, m various places. The tumour frequently dives between the muse es down to the bones, and is not invariably contained in an entire cyst. The adjoining muscles are of a pale colour, and lose their fibrous appearance, becoming more like liver than muscles. The bones near the tumour are always carious. The disease is sometimes caused by external vio- lence ; but frequently the cause is quite unknown. There is no remedy, with which we are acquainted, that seems to have the least power in checking this dire disease ; all escharotics, even undiluted oil of vitriol, are incapable of destroying the fungous growths as fast as they are re- generated. Nothing seems to offer a prospect of preserv- ing life, but the early and total removal of the disease with the knife. This of course is not always practicable on ac- count of the situation of the tumour. W hen it can be done, no part of the surface, surrounding the tumour, should be left, as the disease would certainly recur. This malady is very different from the medullary sar- coma described by Mr. Abernethy, and though it is pro- bable that it has generally been confounded with cancer, it is undoubtedly a widely different disorder, as may be seen by comparing this chapter with that on cancer.

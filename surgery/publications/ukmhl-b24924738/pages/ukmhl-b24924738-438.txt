396 FIRST LINES OF THE 2. Another species is when the blood is effused in conse- quence of a spontaneous rupture of a vessel after the ope- ration, and it is entirely confined to the cavity of the tu- nica vaginalis. The fluid of the hydrocele is not tinged with blood when discharged. 3. In the third kind of haematocele, the blood is extra- vasated within the tunica albuginea, from the vessels of the glandular part of the testicle. 4. The fourth arises from a rupture of a branch of the spermatic vein. TREATMENT. The two first cases may generally be cured by opening the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, removing the effused blood, and applying dry lint to the inside of the membrane. If the quantity of blood were very small, discutients might disperse it, and do away all necessity for operating. The two other cases are less frequent. The third arises from a morbid state of the substance of the testicle, and can only be cured by castration. The last species of haematocele, or that arising from a rupture of the spermatic vein, is generally caused by great or sudden exertions, contusions, &c. When the case is clearly distinguished from a hernia, attempts must be made to promote the absorption of the extravasated blood, by applyingto the tumour the sal am- moniac lotion, or even camphorated liniments. About twice a week a purgative should also be exhibited. If (he case should obstinately resist such treatment, a thing which can hardly occur, an incision must be made into the tumour, and the bleeding point being discovered, it should either be tied, or stopped w ith a dossil of hut.

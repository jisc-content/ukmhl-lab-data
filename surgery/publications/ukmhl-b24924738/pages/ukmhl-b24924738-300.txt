202 FIRST lines OF the *>f the cornea,. The disease is sometimes the consequence of an ulcer, or wound of this membrane. The first spe- cies, arising from the extravasation of lymph, is named albugo; while the term leucoma is particularly applied to the other form of the complaint. The recent albugo may sometimes be dispersed by the same treatment as is applicable to violent ophthalmy, viz. at first general and topical bleedings, internal antiphlogis- tic remedies, and topical emollients; in the second sta°ge, astringent, and moderately stimulating, topical applica- tions. However, all our efforts are unavailing when the action-of the absorbents in the part has been, as it were, deadened, and the texture of the cqrnea disorganized. In recent cases, as soon as the inflammation of the eye has been subdued, there is no better remedy for promoting the absorption of the extravasated opaque matter than the un-. gnent. ht/drarg. nitr., applied accurately to the seat of the opacity by means of a hair pencil. The eye may also be frequently washed with the following collyrium, mentioned in Scarpa’s excellent book on the diseases of the eyes : Two Scruples of sal ammoniac, four grains of yerdigrease, dis- solved in eight ounces of lime water: the mixture is to stand twenty-four hours, and is then to be filtered. The treatment should be continued for three, or four months, before'the case is abandoned as incurable. In the true leucoma, arising from a cicatrix, nothing known has the power of restoring the transparent state 0} the cornea. < ULCEUS OF THE COHNE.L An ulcer of the cornea is Commonly the consequence of the rupture of a small abscess, which not unfrequently. forms beneath the dedicate layer of the conjunctiva, conti- nued over the cornea, or in the very substance of the cornea itself, in consequence of violent ophthalmy.

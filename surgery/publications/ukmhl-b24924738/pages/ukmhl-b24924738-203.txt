PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 169 creases, and the doughy feel changes by degrees into that of elasticity or fluctuation, and a circumscribed, hardened margin can be felt round the base of the t umour. The skin is slightly red. If, at this time, a puncture be made, little or no matter is evacuated, the lips of the wound in- flame and open, displaying a sloughy looking substance within, and betwixt this and the skin a probe can often be introduced for some way all round. When the disease is farther advanced, the tumour is soft, flaccid, and fluctuating; the skin becomes of a light purple colour, and small veins may be seen ramifying on its surface. The skin at. length becomes thinner, and more dark-coloured at a particular part, then bursts and dis- charges a thin fluid, blended with a curdy matter. 1 he redness of the skin continues, but the aperture enlarges, in proportion as the tumour subsides, and thus a scrophulous ulcer is the result. The margins of this ulcer are smooth, obtuse, and overlap the sore ; they are ol a purple colour, and rather hard and tumid. The surface of the ulcer is of a light-red colour; the granulations arc flabby and indistinct. 1 he discharge is thin, and contains flakes ot coagulated matter. The pain is inconsiderable. Such is the excellent and accurate descript ion of scro- phulous inflammation, suppuration, and ulceration, as afforded us by Mr. Burns. The limits of this work will not permit us to trace every form which a scrophulous ulcer assumes. If a diseased bone be situated under a sore of this kind, there is generally a sinus leading dow ir to the carious part. Scrophulous sores and abscesses frequently heal in one place and then occur in another; and they are generally worse in summer than in w inter. The white swelling of the joints will form the subject of an ensuing chapter, and the bronchocele and lumbar ab-

528 FIRST LINES OF THE jyta /:■ <') <**** FRACTURES OF THE FOREARM. The radius and ulna may be broken at their middle, br extreme portions. Of the two bones the radius is far the most frequently fractured. When only one bone is broken, the ends of the fracture are, in general, not much dis- placed. Sometimes, however, the radius, when fractured alone, is drawn toward the ulna, and.in a few still more un- common instances, the latter bone, when-the only one broken is-inclined toward the radius. When both bones are broken, the ends of the fracture are liable to be dis- placed ; nay, cases are recorded, in which the radius and idna have so pressed against eacli other, that they have grown together, and the pronation and supination of the hand been totally destroyed. Fractures of the radius are very easily detected : for on endeavouring to rotate the bone, or, in other words, to place t he hand alternately in a prone, or supine posture, a crepitus is commonly per- ceived. When the two bones are broken, together with the crepitus, there is usually an evident distortion in the tigurc of the forearm. Fractures of the ulna, especially when situated high up, are not always very manifest to the touch ; however, if the surgeon make pressure on each side of the suspected point, with his thumbs alternately, he may generally distinguish a grating sensation. When only one bone is fractured, no extension is ordinarily re- quisite; but, if both the radius and ulna should be thus injured, moderate extension should always be made. During the treatment the elbow' is to be bent, and the hand put in the raid state, between pronation and supina- tion ; that is to say, the palm of the hand is to face the patient’s breast. Having reduced the ends of the fracture, if they should appear to be displaced, the soap plaster is to be applied, and over this a slack rollei. No one can doubt, (hat tight bandages may act very perniciously in fractures of the forearm, by pressing the radius and ulna

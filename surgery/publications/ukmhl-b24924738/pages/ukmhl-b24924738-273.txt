PRACTICE OF SURGERY. C37 atom of the fungus can be conveniently cut out.

THIS term is applied to a species of herpes, which Ts frequently seen making its attack on the skin of the nose. The disease consists of small, superficial ulcerations, which usually commence on the alee ol the part, and are, more or less, concealed beneath furfuraccous scabs. The com- plaint is connected with specific morbid action in the part affected , and the matter secreted seems to have the power of infecting the adjoining skin, to which it is applied. Hence the noli me tangere often proves exceedingly obsti- nate, spreading on one side, healing on another, and then breaking out again in places where, at one time, the com- plaint seemed to have entirely ceased. I have repeatedly seen nearly the whole nose gradually destroyed by this frequently intractable malady. 1 have several times seen the morbid process suspended for six months, or eve^a year, and then renew its ravages with in- creased vehemence. Such authors as have attempted to explain the causes of this species of herpes, have only displayed their own cre- dulity, without throwing the least light on the subject. TREATMENT. In these cases it is generally useful to employ internal alterative medicines- as well as topical applications.

FIRST LINES OF THE 388 1 / nor part of the viscus, having once entered the opening, the posterior one must necessarily follow, together with the portion of peritoneum attached to it, and to the fundus of this organ. Thus the continuous part of this membrane, lining the abdominal ring, will become in the end dragged, so as to occasion a pouch, following the portion of the bladder which forms the hernia. In intestinal and omental ruptures the hernial sac always precedes the viscera ; but in the case of cystocele the bladder is first protruded, and the peritoneum follows it. The peritoneal pouch following the displaced bladder being empty, and its cavity communicating with the ab- domen, it is easy to conceive how a hernia of this organ should sometimes be complicated with one of the omentum or intestines. In most instances the spermatic cord lies behind the above pouch, but Le Dran and others have met with it situated in front. The diagnosis of the cystocele must be rendered suffi- ciently manifest by the regular subsidence of the tumour whenever the patient makes water, and by his being ob- liged to compress the swelling, in order to accomplish this evacuation with ease. TREATMENT. While recent this hernia is easily reducible, and may be kept up by a bandage, or truss ; but when of long stand- ing, or large size, the outer surface of the bladder has be- come adherent to the surrounding parts, and the patient must be contented with a suspensory bag. The rarer sorts of hernim cannot be treated of consistently with the plan of the present publication.

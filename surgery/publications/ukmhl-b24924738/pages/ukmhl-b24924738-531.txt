PRACTICE OF SURGERY. tebra, and the finger could be passed quite through into the abdomen. The sac is commonly filled with a clear, transparent fluid ; but occasionally it is turbid, yellowish, and bloody. The portion of the spinal marrow, surrounded by the fluid, is generally softened, and almost like mucus. Children, afflicted with this disease, sometimes suffer, at the same time, from hydrocephalus. They seldom live longer than a year after birth. The tumour generally con- tinues to enlarge. Occasionally, it inflames and ulcerates, and then death very soon follows. Children are observed to live longest, when the swelling is remote from the head. The instances of persons attaining a middle age with this disorder are rare, and they have mostly had their lower ex- tremities in a paralytic, useless state. Experience proves, that puncturing the tumour, and endeavouring to discharge the fluid, cither at once, 01 gra- dually, is invariably followed by fatal consequences. Ty- ing the pedicles of such spinae bifidoe, as have narrow bases, is also productive of death. Diuretic and purgative medicines seem to be of little avail in the present cases; the latter only increase the weakness and diarrhoea, under which the constitution is very frequently already sinking. Pressure only repels the fluid out of the sac, into the spinal canal, and has no effect in causing the fluid to be absorbed. No known applica- tions have hitherto succeeded. Richter pr poses the trial of two caustic issues, applied at a little distance from the tumour. The completion of the ossification of the vertebrae is an object, which nature alone can possibly accomplish. There is not one instance recorded of spina bifida being cured. In general, the only good, which a surgeon can do, is to instruct the friends of the patient to keep the tumour out of the way of every thing, that has a tendency to make it inflame and ulcerate. All pressure should be avoided.

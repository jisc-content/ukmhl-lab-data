PfiACTICE OF SURGERY. , 399 that particular description, which amounts to a prohibi- tion of an operation. One enlargement of the cord is perfectly free from malig- nancy, and proceeds either from a varicose dilatation of the spermatic veins and arteries, or from a collection of fluid in the membrane enveloping the said vessels. In this case, the cord, though enlarged, is smooth, soft, and compressf- ble; the whole process is loose and free, and will easily per-. Jiiit the fingers of an examiner to go all round it, und to distinguish the parts of which it is composed; and it is not painful when touched. In that morbid state of the cord, in which the operation is forbidden, the part is unequally hard and knotty ; the parts of which it consists are undistinguishably blended together; and handling it occasions pains, shooting up to the loins and back. There is a particular affection of the testicle, in which a fungus grows from the glandular substance of this body, and, in some cases, from the surface of the tunica albugi* noa. I his excrescence is usually preceded by an enlarge- ment of the testicle, in consequence of a bruise, or some species of external violence. ' A small abscess takes place and bursts, and from the ulcerated opening the fungus gradually protrudes. If, when the inflammatory affection of the testicle has subsided, the substance ot this body should not be much indurated or enlarged, it is a very rational practice to en- deavour to extirpate the fungus, and diseased portion of the testis, without removing the whole of this body. The object may sometimes be fulfilled by destroying the fungus with the lapis infernalis. But, at all events, the fungus, and whatever superficial portion of the substance ot the testicle is also diseased, might be removed with a knife. Such an operation has very lately been performed with success in St. Bartholomewâ€™s hospital, by Sir James Earle.

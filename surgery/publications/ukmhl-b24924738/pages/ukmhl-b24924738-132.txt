100 FIRST LINES OF THE red and furious. The patient sometimes, notwithstanding such symptoms, retains his senses to the last. TREATMENT OF HYDROPHOBIA. As no medicine, hitherto known to the medical world, is capable ot infallibly counteracting the baneful effects of the canine poison, practitioners arc strongly called upon to inculcate upon the mind of the patient and his relations, the necessity of doing whatever is most likely to prevent file system from being affected. As a preventive, surely nothing is more rational, nothing is so forcibly indicated, as the excision of the part bitten immediately after the accident. In all poisoned wounds, the adoption of other steps to prevent the system from be- ing affected, is inferior to the obvious efficacy of excision. It is well known, that a young gentleman of rank in this country, not many years ago, died of hydrophobia, though, caustic was applied as a substitute for the excision of the parts. No man of conscience, or discernment, would neglect to urge in strong terms the use of the knife. In every case where there is strong suspicion that the bite is inflicted by a mad animal, common prudence dic- tates a complete removal of the wounded parts by the scalpel. Practitioners chiefly decide in favour of employing, in- ternally, medicines of the antispasmodic and diaphoretic sort. Camphor, musk, the volatile alkali, and belladonna, are the principal ones used. The cases, on which the preventative virtue of such me- dicines is founded, are all however very questionable and inconclusive. In general, before these are given, -stepsare taken to free the wound from the canine poison. Hydro- phobia also only happens in a small proportion of those patients who are bitlen ; and the animal is frequently not mad when it is supposed to be so. 4

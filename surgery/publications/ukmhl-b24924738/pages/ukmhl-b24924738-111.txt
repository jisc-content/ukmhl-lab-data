79 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. By it the formation of much new skin is rendered unneces- sary ; a great advantage, as parts originally formed are much fitter for the purposes of life than those that are newly formed. By it, wounds which from chirurgical neglect, have lost the opportunity of uniting by the adha* sive inflammation, and others which must necessarily heal in a more circuitous manner, are ultimately brought almost into the same state as if they had been united by the first intention. The cicatrix, compared with the original breadth of the wound, is by this beneficial process often made as one to three. After the whole wound is covered with skin, the remains of the granulations beneath it will continue to contract, till hardly any thing more is left than what the new skin stands upon. This is a very small part, in comparison with the first formed granulations ; and it in time loses more of its apparent vessels, and becomes white, and like ligament. OF THE GROWTH OF NEW SKIN OVER GRANULATIONS. When a wound begins to heal by the granulating pro- cess, the surrounding old skin, close to the granulations, no longer discovers the glossy redness, about one-fourth, or one half, of an inch in breadth, which it previously shewed. The angular margin of the skin becomes con- verted into a roundish, smooth, and white boundary; and the nearer to the cicatrizing edge, the whiter it is. This white substance Mr. Hunter suspected to be a beginning cuticle. Skin is a very different substance, with respect to tex- ture, from the granulations, upon which it is formed. Whether it is a new matter, deposited on the granulations, and produced by them, or only the surface of the granula- tions themselves changed, is not easily determined. The new skin most commonly takes its rise from the ad- jacent old skin, as if elongated from it: but this is not re-

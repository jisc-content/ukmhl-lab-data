FIRST LINES OF THE 3G8 its natural colour for a livid hue. Whether it keeps, or loses its colour, it has an emphjsetnatous feel, a crepitus to the touch. This crepitus is the sure indication of gan- grenous mischief within. In this state the gut either goes up spontaneously, or is returned with (he smallest degree ot pressure; a discharge is made by stool, and the patient fancies himself better. This feeling, however* is of short cluiation; for the hiccough, and the cold sweats continu- ing and increasing, with the addition ot convulsive symp- toms, death soon follows. CAUSES OF HEHNI.E. Every motion, exercise, or exertion, in which the abdo- minal muscles are thrown into a state of powerful action, compress the viscera, and diminish the capacity ofthe ab- domen* must be considered as particularly conducive to the occurrence of hernial On such occasions the bowels necessarily push against the elastic peritoneum, and make it protiude in the form ot a pouch, at any point where the parietes ot the abdomen do not make sufficient mechanical resistance. Rut as in the common occupations and.habits of life, the abdorniiial muscles very ofien make considerable pressure! on flie viscera, and only a certain proportion ot mankind is afflicted with ruptures, we must' conclude, that in those persons, who are afflicted* there must have existed a want of strength in such parts of the pa- fietes of the abdomen as are the seat of the hernia?. This sentiment is corroborated by the ordinary occurrence of the disease at such places as seem naturally to present the least resistance to protrusion of the viscera; for instance, the abdominal ring, and space beneatli Pouparlâ€™s ligament. The opinion is also continued by the occasional origin of ruptures in situations where the peritoneum has, some time before, been wounded. Some men may naturally have abdominal rings of a larger dimension!, and of a w eaker fabric, than those of the /

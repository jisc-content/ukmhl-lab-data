PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 69 The celerity, with which the process of union by the first intention is completed, is a circumstance that must excite the admiration of the philosophical surgeon. In the short space of seventy-two hours, the wound, produced by amputation of the thigh, is often securely united throughout its whole extent, without any suppuration, except just where the ligatures are situated. Incised wounds, of a moderate size, may in general be completely healed by this method in forty-eight hours. How dif- ferent then is the surgery of the present day to that of hall a century ago, when the bigoted prejudices of our an- cestors deterred them from doing, not only what was most salutary, but most simple! The complicated business of accomplishing digestion, incarnation, and cicatrization, is now reduced to the easy duly of bringing the edges of a clean cut wound into contact, and maintaining them so, until they have grown together. CHAP. XVI. PUNCTURED WOUNDS. PUNCTURED wounds are not only dangerous, on account of their frequently extending to a considerable depth, and injuring important blood-vessels, nerves, and viscera, they are also dangerous inasmuch as they frequent- ly give rise to very extensive inflammation. It is not un- common to see formidable collections of matter follow wounds of this description, especially when the instrument, w ith which they have been made, has penetrated any apo- neurosis, or fascia. Stabs, and all other punctures, are not simple divisions of the fibres of the body, they are at- tended with more or less contusion and laceration. Hence there is not the same readiness to unite, which we observe

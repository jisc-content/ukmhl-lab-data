PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 101 When the system is affected the event is almost always fatal. As the symptoms of hydrophobia are visibly attend- ed with a disposition to spasm in the muscles, some pal- liation may be reasonably expected from the above class of medicines. But as the disease is of a. most violent nature, no considerable benefit can be expected unless they are ad- ministered in large doses. Opium, in such doses as are given in tetanus, may very properly be administered in conjunction with the medicines named above. The treat- ment, after the constitution is once affected, may render the journey to the grave more comfortable, but it is perhaps never efficacious enough to restore health. Plunging the patient in the sea, or cold bath, and keep- ing him under the water till nearly drowned, is frequently practised with a view of preventing the disease. Mercurial frictions have also been employed, both be- fore and after the system has become affected. JEther might perhaps be serviceable, when the consti- tutional symptoms have commenced.* \ -• ' • i . CHAP. XXI. AFFECTIONS OF THE NERVOUS AND MUSCU- LAR SYSTEMS, AND MATERIA Vlr£M, IN CONSEQUENCE OF WOUNDS. WOUNDS are sometimes followed by very extraordi- nary symptoms, and such as we can often only attempt to explain, by referring them to the effect of local irritation * The rest of the subject of wounds, will be arranged with particular surgical subjects in Part 2.

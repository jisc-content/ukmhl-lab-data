401 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. done, (hey introduce a 'ligature under the cord, and tie it in a very firm manner. At the moment of doing this, the patient is put to excruciating lorture ; such suffering, in- deed, as few can endure without complaint, let their forti- tude be ever so great. A very considerable part of (his agony is known to arise from including the vas deferens in the ligature. As this vessel can always be distinctly felt, by reason of its firm structure, at the back part of the cord, as it can always be most easily separated from the rest of this process, and no good whatever can possibly result from tying it; the sur- geon who puts the patient to unnecessary pain by includ- ing the whole spermatic cord in the ligature, is highly re- prehensible. At all events, it is his duty to leave out the vas deferens. A common aneurism needle is the most con- venient instrument for introducing the ligature, which is afterwards to be firmly tied. But when the spermatic cord is free from disease, and it is unnecessary to divide it near the abdominal ring, there is a method of proceeding still better than that which I have already mentioned. Desault, and several other excellent modern surgeons, have shewn in their practice, that, under such circumstances, the spermatic cord may be safely di- vided with a knife at once, the hemorrhage being stopped by the surgeon firmly holding the upper end of the di- vided part between his finger and thumb, until the arteries have been tied in the common way, with the assistance of a pair of forceps. However, if the surgeon should prefer tying the cord, let him never neglect to leave the vas deferens out of the ligature: having done this, he is to pass a curved bistoury under the whole cord, and divide it below where it is tied. The rest of the operation is extremely simple. It merely consists in dividing the loose cellular substance, which connects the testicle with the inside of the scrotum. Ih d n

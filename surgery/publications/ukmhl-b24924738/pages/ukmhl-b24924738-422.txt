FIRST LINES OF TtlE 382 commence from tire point where the hernia protrudes; that is, let it begin just hbove Poupart’s ligament, a little nearer to the S} mphysis pubis, than the femoral vessels arc, and ltd continued the whole length of the tumour. Any glands, which may lie over the hernia, should be avoided. The sac is still concealed beneath cellular substance, which is here much thicker than where the bubonocele occurs, and beneath aponeurotic fibres, which proceed from the femo- ral fascia, ascend obliquely over the- front of the thigh, and are connected with the lower and external part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle. These fibres must be divided before the hernial sac can be exposed ; but iri doing this some caution is requisite, on account of the fe- moral vessels, whichy though' commonly situated behind the hernial tumour, may be found immediately on the side ot the swelling, when it is very small. The object, how-4 ever, may be safely accomplished with a director, which is to be placed under the fibres before they are cut* The hernial sac is to be opened by means of a pair of dissecting fiorceps and bistoury. The operator is to raise the part by taking hold of the cellular membrane attached to it, aud is then to make a very small aperture by a superficial horizontal cut. Through this opening a director may be introduced, and the surgeon may then safely divide the sac nearly as high as Poupart’s ligament, and quite to the bottom of the tumour. The next object is to divide the stricture; Until very lately practitioners have been in the habit of supposing the stricture, in these cases, to be always caused by Poupart’s ligament, and consequently its division has generally been deemed the chief point of the operation. Le Dran (obs; 57) had long ago observed, in operatingfor a crural hernia, that the closest strangulation was not made by this liga- ment ; and when he divided the neck of the saC, no doubt he cut what Mr. I ley has since named the femdral liga- ment ,■ the part generally producing the pressure on tlie

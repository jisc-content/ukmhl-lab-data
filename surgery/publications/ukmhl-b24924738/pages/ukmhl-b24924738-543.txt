PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 50* nor persist, if the trial should create pain. One would hardlj try, whether the ligature on the great artery is loose before the eighth or ninth day. AMPUTATION BELOW THE KNEE. In the thigh, we amputate as low as the nature of the case will allow us. In the leg, the common practice is al- ways to make the incision through the integuments suffi- ciently low, to enable the operator to saw the bones, about four inches below the lower part of the patella. This is necessary, in order not to deprive the stump of that power of motion, which arises from the flexor tendons of the leg continuing undivided. The tourniquet should be applied to the femoral artery, two thirds of the way down the thigh, just before the ves- sel perforates the tendon of the triceps muscle. This is a much more convenient situation than the ham. 1 he leg being properly held, the integuments should next be drawn upward by an assistant, while the surgeon, with one quick stroke of the knife, must divide the skin completely round the limb. Some recommend the operator to stand on the in- side of the leg, in order to be able to saw both bones at once. No reflections could ever make me perceive, that any real advantage ought strictly to be imputed to this plan. I know, that many think it diminishes the chance of the fibula being splintered, as this bone is completely divided rather before the tibia. But splintering the bones arises from the assistant, who holds the leg, depressing the ^imb too much; it would be difficult to explain, why the two bones should not be splintered, when a certain thick- ness of them has been sawn through, if the leg were too forcibly depressed. Having made a circular division of the integuments, the next object is to preserve skin enough to cover the front of the tibia and part of the stump, corresponding to the situa- tion of the tibialis anlicus, extensor longus pollici<} and

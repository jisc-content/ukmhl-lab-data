PRACTICE OF SURGFUY. 31 eluding venesection, may be employed in young,robust persons ; but, very seldom in other subjects. This treat- ment is sometimes necessary in violent burns. When mortification arises without any marks of previ- ous inflammation, but preceded by terrible pains in the part, bark is never of any use. Opium is here, perhaps, the only beneficial medicine. The mortification of the toes and feet, arising in this way, is ably shewn by Mr. Pott to be only benefited by this one remedy. The topi- cal applications should be of an emollient, unirritating kind. When bark is indicated, and it occasions diarrhoea, a, few drops of the tinct. opii should be added to each dose. Bark sometimes disorders the stomach. In this case it should be given in the form of a very subtile powder with wine ; or the tincture, or infusion, may be exhibited. The diet must conform with the plan of treatment. When antiphlogistic means are adopted, nothing but ve- getable food, and diluent beverages, should be allowed. In other cases the diet should be nourishing and anti- septic. Particular attention should be paid to cleanliness. Spicy drinks, taken cold, are highly commendable. When mortification arises from pressure, nothing avails w ithout removing the cause, and even the removal of that, after a certain period, will not prevent the disorder. Cushions placed in particular situations under the patient, and change of posture, are the grand means of prevention in most cases. The local treatment does not differ from that of other mortifications. In every case of sphacelus the surgeon should endeavour to find out, and, if possible, remove the cause. This some- times cannot be discovered; frequently it is known, but cannot be removed. The progress of mortification often stops spontaneously, especially w hen it arises from external injuries. 11

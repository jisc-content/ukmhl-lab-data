FIRST LINES OF THE 332 ticnt lias recovered from this state, bleeding is to be freely practised. It is said, that the substance of the lungs occasionally be- comes emphysematous : the air escapes from tliG air vesi- cles into the interstitial cellular texture; so that the former are compressed, and the palient dies sulfocated. EXTRAVASATION OF BLOOD IN TIIE THORAX. This is liable to happen in all cases, in which the lungs, the intercostal, or internal mammary arteries are^ winded. The symptoms ot blood thus effused are, cv ppresr sipn of the breathing; inability to stand, or â€˜,-ing to the weight of the fluid on the diaphragm ; i ; 0st easy posture is on the affected side, but the patient cannot lie on the opposite one without great aggravation of his oppressed breathing ; the respiration is short, frequent, and interrupted ; the countenance is particularly pale. logether with these symptoms, which are indeed very inconclusive, the extremities become cold; a clammy per- spiration takes place ; and if the lungs are wounded, frothy blood is spit from the mouth, and air often escapes from the wound. It is to be regretted that these symptoms are very fallacious. TREATMENT. Though sometimes, when the quantity of blood has been moderate, the symptoms have not urged the necessity of removing it, and the absorbents have afterwards per? formed this .office ; yet, in general, the indication is to take some surgical steps for its immediate evacuation. Several things which promote this end have been prac- tised. 1. Placing the patient in such a posture as is fa- vourable to the exit of blood from the wound. 2. Drawing the blood out by a syringe. 3.

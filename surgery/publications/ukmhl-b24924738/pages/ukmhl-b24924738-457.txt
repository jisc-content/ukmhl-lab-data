In cases of gonorrhoea, when the inflammation is not confined merely to the surface of the urethra and its glands, but affects the reticular membrane, it produces in the latter part an extravasation of coagulating lymph, which unites the cells together, destroys the power of distention of the corpus spongiosum urethras, and makes it unequal, in this respect, to the corpora cavernosa penis. Hence, a curva- ture takes place, at the time of an erection, aud is termed a chordce. The concavity of the curvature is, generally, at the lower part of the penis. " t TREATMENT. When much inflammation is present, bleeding from the arm, and,mere especially, from the part itself by leeches, is proper. The penis may be exposed to the steam of hot water. Camphorated fomentations and poultices are also very beneficial applications. At the same time, opium aud camphor may be given as internal medicines. When all inflammation has been subdued, the indica- tion is to effect the absorption of the coagulating lymph; and, for this purpose, nothing is better, than friction on the part with camphorated mercurial ointment. SYMPATHETIC BUBO. Gonorrhoea is sometimes attended with a swelling of the inguinal glands, termed a sympathetic bubo. This com- plaint is supposed to originate from mere irritation, and not from the absorption of matter. We know that the lympha- tic glands are capable of becoming inflamed in this man- ner ; for in various diseases we see them frequently swell at a more remote situation from the thoracic duct, than the local complaint, which is the exciting cause of their en-

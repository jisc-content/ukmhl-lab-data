The morbid structure in question frequently takes place in the breast, a little above, and on that side of the nipple which is next to the arm. In general the disease is chronic, and does not involve the absorbent glands in the vicinity. But in a few instances this species of sarcoma, when situat- ed in the breast, deviates from its ordinary indolent natim-, and occasions severe and lancinating pain, an inflamma- tory state of the integuments, and an adhesion of them to the tumour. The axillary glands also enlarge. Pancreatic sarcoma is sometimes so irritable a disease, that Mr. Abernethy thinks it may frequently be considered as a cancer. When the glands in the axilla become affect- ed, one generally swells at first, and is extremely tender and painful ; afterwards the pain abates, and it remains indurated; another then becomes a fleeted, and runs through the same course. Dr. Bouttatz, of Moscow, has published an account of a tumour, which resembled the pancreas in its structure, and grew beneath the conjunctiva of the eye. 4 . CYSTIC S A IICOM A. This name is applied because the disease contains cyst*, pr cells. Cystic sarcoma sometimes occurs as a distinct tumour, but is commotdy met with in the testis and oi ary. The cysts, both in the former and latter part, are capable of being rendered red by anatomical injection. I he cavi- ties generally contain a serous fluid, but sometimes a case- ous substance. Mr. Abernethy believes this last sort of case, when the testicle is concerned, is peculiarly intract- able. 5. MASTOID, OR MAMMARY SARCOMA, So named from its resemblance to the mammary gland in structure. Mr. Abernethy has not frequently seen this

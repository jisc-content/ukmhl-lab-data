5-14 ElRST LINES'OF THE one inward, the other outward. The first case is always occasioned by external violence; the second, by the pres- sure of the childâ€™s head, in difficult labours. The nature of these accidents is easily detected by the foregoing causey and by an examination with the fingers, externally, and within the rectum. Pain; retention of the faeces,- and urine; lin afflicting tenesmus; inflammation, sometimes, terminating in abscesses, uhicli interest the rectum; are symptoms, said to attend, and follow, dislocations of the os cbccygis. Luxations of this sort are easy of reduction. When the bone is dislocated outward, it may be readily replaced in its natural situation, by making proper pressure exter- nally, and supporting the little bone, at the same time, by a finger introduced into the rectum. The reduction being finished, a piece of soap plaster, a compress, and the T ban- dage, may be applied. W hen the os coccygis is luxated inward, the surgeon h to smear his fore finger with oil, and introduce it into the rectum. Then the bone,is to be pressed outward, while proper resistance is made externally with the fingers of the other hand. After the reduction, all pressure is to be care- fully avoided, lest the bone should be forced inward again. DISLOCATION OF THE ItIBS. These bones are very rarely luxated at their articulation with the vertebras; but the case is said to occur every now and then in practice. Authors state, that a hollow is per- ceptible at the side of the transverse process of the verte- bra ; and that when pressure is made on the thorax, so as to push backward the dislocated rib, the head of the bone may be distinctly felt moving into its proper situation, provided the fingers are duly placed for this purpose. The treatment of a dislocated rib is very simple r the displaced head of the bone is to be first reduced by firmly pressing backward its anterior end. Then a thick com'

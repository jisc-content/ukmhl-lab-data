Some- times a circumscribed moveable, or immoveable scirrhous swelling is first pbservable, which gradually becomes pain- ful, and id cerates.

In some cases the w hole, or a large portion, of this organ is cover- ed with numerous small scirrhous tubercles, w hich gradu- ally fall into a state of ulceration. These I have seen greatly diminished by a gentle course of mercury. All the medicines tried in other cases of cancer may be exlii-

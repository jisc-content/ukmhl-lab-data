PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 19 . when it yields to mere mechanical distension, unless the increase of the abscess be very rapid. As the matter advances towards the surface of the body, the intervening substance is absorbed. treatment of phlegmonous abscesses. The generality of phlegmonous abscesses soon burst, and seldom require opening. When punctured unne- cessarily, or prematurely, they never heal so favourably,, as when left to themselves. Particular cases, however, should be opened, as soon as the existence of matter is ascertained. Vt hen suppu- ration takes place beneath fasciae, which invariably retard the progress of the matter to the surface of the body, an early opening should be made. If this be not done, the matter spreads to a great extent, separating such ligament- ous expansions from the muscles, and the muscles i rom each other. Also, when the matter is sosituated as to be liable to insinuate itself into the chest, or abdomen, or into the capsular ligaments of joints, it is highly proper to prevent this extension of mischief, by making a timely opening into the abscess. OPENING ABSCESSES BV A CUTTING INSTRUMENT. There are two ways of opening abscesses ; 1. by a lancet; 2. by caustic. In almost all cases the lancet is pieferabl*?. It opens the abscess quickly, and with less pain ; it occa- sions no loss of substance, consequently a smaller cicatrix , and, by its employment, the opening may be made in the most advantageous direction, and of the exact size ne- cessary. The place where the puncture ought to be made, is where the fluctuation is most perceptible, or where the conical eminence, or, as it is termed, the pointing appears ; for, in this situation, the integuments are thinner, than elsewhere.

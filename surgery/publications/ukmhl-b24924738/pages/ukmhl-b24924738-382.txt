FIRST LINES OF THE 340 The mailer that forms in these eases sometimes makes its way into the tendinous sheath of the rectus muscle; and when the collection of matter in this situation remains un- discovered till a pointing happens, no sooner does it burst, or it is opened, than-some quarts of pus will often gush out. The surgeon should bear in his mind the nature of this case, as there is frequently no change of appearance in the integuments to denote the occurrence and extent of the suppuration, which properly ought to be punctured at an early period, and in a depending situation, sometimes at the veiy lowest part ot the sheath for the rectus muscle. When matter also forms beneath the abdominal muscles, on the exterior surface of the peritoneum, the abscess should be opened soon, to prevent its discharging itself into the abdomen. The propensity of pus to make its way to the surface of the body, is often seen to have im- mense influence in this sort of case. Though there is only a thin membrane intervening between matter so situated, and the cavity of the abdomen, yet it mostly points ex- ternally, if the surgeon neglects to make an opening into it. In all cases where the abdominal muscles arc wounded, it is an indication to place the patient in such a posture as shall relax them. As the peritoneum is connected with the inner surface of the abdominal parietes, there is always a chance of the inflammation of the muscles communicating itself to thi& membrane. The event is to be averted by the rigorous em- ployment of the antiphlogistic treatment. When any point of the peritoneum is affected, the inflammation often spreads with immense rapidity over ifs whole extent. The same treatment is applicable to superficial wounds of the abdomen as to ot hers. Union by the first intention is to be attempted in every case where there is reason to ex- pect success.

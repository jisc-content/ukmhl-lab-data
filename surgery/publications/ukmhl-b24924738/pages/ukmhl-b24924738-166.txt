FIRST LINES OF THE 132 composed of calomel and hogâ€™s lard', or of the ung. hj- rircrg. nit. mixed with camphor, is said to answer better than any other application. A class of irritable ulcers, situated in the vicinity of the ancle, attended with enlargement of the joint itself, and surrounded with a degree of thickening, arc much bene- fited, according to Mr. Home, by poultices and fomenta- tions, containing the conium maculatum. There is a kind of ulcer which does not extend deeper than the cutis, but spreads in all directions. The specific morbid action does not continue in the parts which have ulcerated, but only affects the edge of the skin, where the ulcer is increasing; for the surface, first affected, heals, while the parts beyond arc in a state of ulceration. For such ulcers, of which there a re-several varieties, a solution of the argentum nit rat am is the best application. The last specific ulcer, which I shall here notice, is the fungatccl one. Jt is seen on the calf of the leg and sole of the foot, shooting out a fungus from the surface. The new-formed substance is externally broad, and narrow at its root; it is tender, and bleeds from very slight causes. The disease in its origin somewhat resembles ascrophulous affection of the metatarsal bones, until the skin ulcerates, and the fungus protrudes. One species of this ulcer contaminates the lymphatic glands in the course of absorption ; another kind docs not so. The first case cannot be cured by the internal and ex- ternal use of arsenic ; the second may. From threc-to ten drops of a solution, made by boiling white arsenic in water for several hours in a sand heat, may be given internally. For external use, 3j of this so- lution is diluted with ibj of water, and the mixture may bc gradually made stronger, till it is of double strength.

They are of very various kinds, and conse- quently every attempt to devise appropriate names to dis- tinguish them is at least laudable. Mr. Abernethy, whose ingenuity is ever active in the advancement of medical science, has published a classifica- tion of tumours, and to him we owe the plan, of applying to the various species of sarcoma, terms deduced lrom their anatomical structure. 1. COMMON VASCULAR, OR ORGANIZED SARCOMA. Under this title are comprehended all tumours, which appear to be composed of the gelatinous part of the blood, rendered more or less vascular by the growl h of vessels through it, without having any distinguishable peculiarity of structure. This kind of organization in tumours is the most simple, and, perhaps, may always precede other de- scriptions of structure.

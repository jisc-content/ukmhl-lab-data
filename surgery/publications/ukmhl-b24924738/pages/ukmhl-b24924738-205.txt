PRACTICE OF SURGERY. \7\ Two or three drams of nitrous acid, taken daily, are said to have promoted the suppuration of scrophulous glands, and disposed ulcers to heal. If no good effects should he produced in a fortnight, the medicine ought to be discon- tinued. In malignant scrophulous ulcers the hepatised ammo- nia, in the dose of eight or fen drops thrice a day, has proved beneficial by abating pain, and changing the bad aspect of the sores. Vitriolic emetics, repeatedly exhibited, are said to be useful. With respect to the local treatment of scrophulous tu? incurs and ulcers, little is to be said. Such glandular swellings might be safely extirpated with the knife, when they are favourably situated, and the wound would heal as well as could be wished, hut surgeons do not adopt this practice, perhaps because patients experience no se- vere pain from an indolent sort of enlargement, which also in time very often spontaneously gets well, and because the removal of a scrophulous gland can hardly be said to do much good to a patient, whose whole system is under the influence of strumous derangement. Suppurated scrophulous glands ought never to be open- ed, unless the quantity of contained matter is copious, which is very seldom the case. Sometimes such swellings spontaneously diminish without ulceration ; but when a puncture is made this chance is destroyed, as the wound changes into an unhealthy sore. CIIAP. XXXIV. COW POX.

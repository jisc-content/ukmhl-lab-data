PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 37? Frequently, during the combined action of the ice and tobacco, the contents of the hernte return spontaneously into the abdomen ; but, at *11 events, the surgeon should make another final effort to reduce the parts by the hand. If this again fails, even when the patient has been da y pu under the influence of the tobacco, and if the symptoms ot strangulation, at the same time, continue to increase, 1 io operation ought undoubtedly to be undertaken withou further delay. *- , ' % . BUBONOCEEE. In this case the parts first protrude (as Mr. Astlcy Cooper has explained) at a part, which is situated about an inch and a half from the abdominal ring, in the direction towards the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. The hernial sac descends through the ring over the sper- matic cord, and is covered by a fascia, sent off from the tendon of the external oblique muscle. Beneath this fas- cia, the cremaster muscle is also situated over the sac. When the hernial sac has descended a certain way, it lies upon the tunica vaginalis, as well as the spermatic cord. The epigastric artery commonly passes between the mouth of the sac and the symphysis pubis. This vessel, the above surgeon observes, runs in some degree under (lie sac, and along its inner side. There is no vessel ot importance either above, or on the outside of this part. In old hernim, however, the internal opening of the pas- sage, through which the parts protrude, becomes situated more opposite the abdominal ring. In consequence of the place, where the viscera first, protrude, being situated in the above manner, Mr. A. Cooper recommends the pads of the trusses to be so constructed as to make pressure upon it. Though the hernial sac commonly lies upon the sper- matic cord, it should be remembered, that there are in- stances recorded, in which the vas deferens and spermatic vessels have been situated in front ot the sac.

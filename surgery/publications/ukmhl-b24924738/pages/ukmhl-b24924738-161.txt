PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 127 transparent film, which afterward becomes opaque, and forms cuticle. An ulcer, answering this description, is in a healing state, and the surgeon can only be useful by keeping the surrounding skin clean ; applying soft scraped lint to ab- sorb the redundant quantity of matter, and covering this simple dressing with a pledget of any unirritating oint- ment, with a view of preventing evaporation from the sur- face of the sore ; a thing which would lead to the forma- tion of a scab, and often change the favourable condition of the ulcer. A roller may be applied, unless it should seem to act perniciously ; in most instances, it not only serves to re- tain the dressings and as a kind of defence to the sore, but also to support the muscles and skin, which are fre- quently loose and flabby, from the want of natural exercise of the limb. 2. IRRITABLE ULCERS. Irritable ulcers cannot always be known by their ap- pearance, though, in many instances, they can be so dis- criminated. A sore will invariably partake very much of the nature of the constitution, and when this is known to be irritable, the local complaint will also be often found to be so. A surgeon, however, is frequently quite unaware of this quality of an ulcer under his care, until, perhaps, at the end of a little time, not finding the sore heal sufficient- ly quickly, he ventures to apply some stimulating appli- cation, or to roll the bandage round the limb more tightly than before. The next day he is mortified to find that his patient has passed a miserable night, and several dis- coloured sloughy places have formed on the surface, and also at the circumference of the sore. At other parts the granulations have been rapidly absorbed, and whatever matter lies on the surface of the ulcer, is diminished in quantify, and of a blackish, fetid quality. When the ex-

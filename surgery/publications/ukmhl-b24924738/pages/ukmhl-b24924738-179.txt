PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 145 OF CANCER IN THE STATE OF ULCERATION. The diseased skin covering a carcinomatous tumour ge- nerally ulcerates before the swelling has attained any great magnitude. A large chasm is then produced in its subr stance, partly by a sloughing, and partly by an ulcerating process. A copious discharge of very fetid, sanious mat- ter follows. The ulcer becomes irregular in its figure, and unequal on its surface. The edges are thick, indurated, and extremely painful; they often exhibit a serrated ap- pearance, being sometimes retorted, at other times invert- ed. The ulcer sometimes spreads with rapidity to a great extent, and its progress produces frequent hemorrhages, which, joined with the irritation of the disease, reduce the patient to the lowest state of debility. Granulations gene- rail}' grow on the ulcerated surface, when the ravages of the disorder seem to undergo a temporary stop; but this apparent attempt at reparation only ends in the formation of an inveterate fungous substance. At length the absorbent glands become diseased, and death puts an end to the patient’s sufferings. Previous to this event a cough and difficulty of breathing generally occur. TREATMENT OF SCIRRIIUS AND ULCERATED CANCER. The treatment of scirrhus embraces two objects, the dispersion, and the removal, of the tumour. When the • -hardness is so situated as to be easily removed by the knife, no delay should be occasioned by attempting to disperse a swelling of this nature. The operation ought to be per- formed early, as the chance of effectual extirpation is then greater. On the other hand, the attempts at dispersion rarely succeed; the means employed are tedious in their operation, often injure the health, and when of an irritating nature, and incautiously applied, convert the scirrhus into a cancer. Prudence will only allow the operation to be L

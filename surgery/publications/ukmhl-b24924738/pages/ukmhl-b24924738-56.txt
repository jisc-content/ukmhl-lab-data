FIRST LINES OF THE An unpleasant hiccough commonly attends (he occur- rence of gangrene and sphacelus. The blood coagulates in the large vessels leading to the mortified part, (or some distance from the slough, and this is the reason why the separation of a mortified limb is seldom followed by hemorrhage. When any part of the body mortifies, the constitution suffers immediately a considerable dejection. The patientâ€™s countenance suddenly assumes a wild cadaverous look ; the pulse becomes small, rapid, and somet imes irregular; cold perspirations, diarrhoea, and even delirium occur. MORTIFICATION UNPRECEDED BY INFLAMMATION. Mortification often takes place unpreceded by inflam- mation. Impediment to the return of blood through the veins sometimes produces gangrene and sphacelus. In this case the bloodvessels become turgid, and the part swells, and becomes livid and very painfub Vesicles soon arise, and, at length, the part becomes soft, cedematous, em- physematous, cold, black, insensible, and fetid. A stran- gulated hernia affords an instance of such mortification. Impediment to the flow of arterial blood into a partis another cause of mortification. This case is at first at- tended with softness and coldness of the part, which loses its natural size, and becomes void of sensibility, shrivelled, black, and lifeless. Great general debility, extreme old age, and an ossified state of the arteries, frequently produce a species of morti- fication, different from that following inflammation. Pressure on any part of the body, especially when the constitution is weak, and the circulation languid, in con- sequence of sickness, and long confinement in bed, often occasions mortification. This frequently occurs in such cases as fractures, where the patient is necessitated tore- main a long time in the same posture. It attacks parts

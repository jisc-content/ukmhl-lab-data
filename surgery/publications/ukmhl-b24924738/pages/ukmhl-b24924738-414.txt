FIRST LINES OF TKtf # . , ' i V practised. The testimony of the best writers is in favour of this plan ; and the little time consumed in trying its ef- fect, is anotner weighty circumstance in its recommenda- tion. A strangulated hernia is to be regarded as a disease ac- companied with a considerable tendency to inflammation : the impeded functions of the intestinal canal may, and do certainly ,prod u ce alarming derangement of the constitution; but I cannot help considering the advanced progress of (lie inflammation in the contents of the hernia, as the most fre- quent cause of death, the degree of danger being in some degree proportioned to the state of the protruded vis- cera. Hence bleeding must also prove useful, by coun- teracting the inflammatory symptoms. In very old and feeble subjects, the use of the lancet might certainly be sometimes judiciously omitted ; but, in general, venesection must be deemed a very proper mea- sure. The examination of every subject after death, in conse- quence of this disease, discloses, that inflammation and gangrene are almost infallible consequences of the strangu- lation being continued beyond a certain period. I enter- tain a firth opinion, that Mr. Wilnunyof Coventry, not- withstanding the bad effects which he imagined to arise from bleeding, has only offered a visionary and unfounded theory in explanation of tire cause of death in these cases. Had he been entirely divested of prejudice, it would be difficult to conceive how he could have overlooked the strong and manifest traces of inflammation, apparent in every subject after death. Mr. Wilmerâ€™s idea, that bleed- ing renders the subsequent operation more dangerous, is very ably refuted by Mr. Hey. Mr. Alarison thought, (hat bleeding never promoted the success of the taxis. However, this opinion is contrary to the sentiments of the best writers, and most experienced prac-

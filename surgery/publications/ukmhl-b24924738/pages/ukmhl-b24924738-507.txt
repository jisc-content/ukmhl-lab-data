465 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. A soft poultice is the best application for promoting sup- puration. When the inflammation is phlegmonous, the thinner the skin is suffered to become, before the abscess is opened, the better. If the patient be of a full, sanguine habit, venesection, and mild purgatives, are proper. When the attack is of an erysipelatous kind, and there is a sloughy state of the cellular membrane, the sooner it is opened, the better. As Mr. Pott observes, if we wait for the matter to point, we shall wait for what will not hap- pen, at least, not till after a considerable length of time, during which the disease in the membrane will extend it- self, and, consequently, the cavity of the sinus, or abscess, be thereby greatly increased. When the fistula in ano commences with that kind of in- flammation, which a carbuncle exhibits, no evacuations are necessary. The part should be opened early by a very free incision. In opening all abscesses about the anus, the incision should be so large as to divide all the skin covering the matter. Thus the abscess will be discharged at once; fu- ture lodgment of matter will be prevented : and convenient room will be made for the application of proper dressings. Allfistulas in ano do not necessarily interest the rectum : sometimes the matter is so distant from the intestine, that the surgeon has no more to do with this part, than if it were not to exist, and the abscess is to be treated upon ge- neral principles. The idea of callosity, naturally attached to the term fis- tula, is the great cause, why former surgeons were in the habit of distending abscesses, about the anus, with escha- rotics, and why they eycn sometimes cut away consider- able portions of flesh. It is true, there is hardness gone-* rally surrounding fistulas in ano, but this is only such as accompanies every other description of abscess. The dressings, applied to the cavities of those collec- tions of matter, ought to be so small in quantity, as to al- ii u

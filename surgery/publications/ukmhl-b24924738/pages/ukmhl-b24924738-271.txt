235 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. and frequently, in consequence of the communication be- tween the nose and antrum being closed, there is no puru- lent discharge whatever. The disease, when more advanced, becomes more ob- vious. The whole antrum now expands, and its parietes become extenuated by absorption, the expansion of the bone towards the nose may produce a complete obstruction of the nostril, or ils swelling above may raise the floor of the orbit, and push the eye out ol its situation. lÂ»ut the greatest degree of expansion commonly takes place to- wards the surface of lire body, for all collections of matter have a natural tendency to burst externally. At. length the abscess makes its way through the bony parietes of the antrum, and continues to be discharged through ulcerated openings. In some instances the matter finds a passage into the mouth, through one of the sockcls for the teeth. The most common cause of suppuration in the antrum, is a caries of one or more of the upper grinding teeth. The general causes, however, capable ol exciting local in- flammation in any situation, may also have the same effect in the present one. An obstruction of the opening, through which themucus flows-from the antrum into the nose, may create such an accumulation of this secretion as shall occa- sion suppuration. The indications in the cure arc chiefly two, viz. to pro- cure a vent for the matter confined in the antrum as spee- dily as possible; and to check the suppuration, and pro- mote the separation of any exfoliations which are taking place. When there is any carious tooth below the antrum, the surgeon should always extract it; for thus he not only re- moves a source of great irritation, but frequently makes at once a depending opening into the antrum. When the fang of the tooth does not extend quite into this cavity, the perforation must be completed with a sharp gimlet. If

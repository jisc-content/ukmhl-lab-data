FIRST LINES OF THE 6S CHAP. XV. PROCESS BY WHICH THE WOUND IS UNITED. \\ IIEN the opposite sides of arr incised wound are maintained in contact by the foregoing means, they soon become permanently connected together. The vessels of the wounded surface cease bleeding, and their extremities become impervious to the blood itself, but not to the coagu- lating lymph, which forms the general bond of union be- tween living parts. This uniting medium is the primi- tive and most simple connexion, that takes place between the two sides ofa wound. In many cases, however, where the wound is put into a state of apposition, before the he- morrhage has had time to cease, no doubt a coagulum of blood itself constitutes the first bond of union‚Äù and, as Wounds must thus be frequently united through the me- dium of red blood, the propriety of cleaning a wound from it so exactly as some surgeons do, may be called in ques- tion. The simple agglutination of the sides of a wound together, is what may be considered as taking place direct- ly they have been brought into contact. The next step, in the process of union by the first intention, is the genera- tion of vessels in the coagulating lymph, or blood, and this is soon followed by an intercourse between the vessels of the two sides of the wound. The manner in which the new vessels arise in the uniting medium,-as well as the way in which the inosculation of the divided vessels happens, are at present only matters of conjecture. Mr. Hunter conceived, that blood and coagulating lymph, as long as they retained the living principle, possessed the faculty of generating vessels within themselves, quite independently of any adjoining surfaces. In the growth of the chick, there are some appearances in favour of this opinion.

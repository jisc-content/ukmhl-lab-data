Sometimes it is soft, sometimes quite fluid, and in other instances hard, and even ossified.* W hen the matter is fluid, like honey, the tumour is named melicens ; when of a pappy quality, atheroma; when fatty, steatoma. These swellings have a soft or hard feel, according to the nature of their contents; but the consistence of the con- tained matter cannot always be ascertained by the touch, especially when the cyst is very thick. Sometimes the cyst is very thin, sometimes very thick, but in general, though not always, its thickness is pro- portioned to its age. It is often quite firm, like parch- ment or cartilage ; and it commonly contains only one cavity ; however, this is frequently insected by several par- titions. Sieatomatous tumours sometimes consist of several contiguous cysts, which may easily be separated from each other. Encysted tumours are usually situated immediately un- der the skin; but occasionally they form in deeper situa- tions. Such swellings, especially steatomatous ones, fre- quently attain an enormous magnitude. At first they are constantly moveable, and probably would continue so, if all external pressure were kept from influencing them. IÂ» time they become immovable, that is, they become ad- herent to the skin and subjacent parts. The surgeon may either discuss these tumours, or ex- * When the skin ulcerates, some of this sort protrude and appear Ji;e horns. * '

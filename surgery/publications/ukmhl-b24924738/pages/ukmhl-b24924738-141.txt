PRACTICE OF SURGERY, 1C9 treatment. Slight contusions may be considered as occasioning only a weakness of the bruised vessels, and a degree of extra- vasation in the part. Any corroborant, astringent appli- cations, suffice for tln^se accidents. The injured parts are to have linen, moistened with vinegar, cold water, brandy, lime-water, solutions of alum, or ot acetite of lead, ap- plied to them. When muscles are bruised, they ought to be relaxed, and kept perfectly quiet. Nothing is more conducive than quietude to the restoration of their proper tone. Rest, one of the above mentioned topical remedies, and a dose of any mild purgative salt, generally complete the cure of ordinary bruises. When the contusion, however, is of a more violent de- scription, and the quantity ot extravasation is consider- able, bleeding, and other evacuations, are proper. The topical applications should be such as are mildly stimulat- ing, and, consequently, such as are adapted to excite the action of the absorbents. Sal ammoniac, dissolved in equal parts of vinegar *and water, or the aq. amnion, acel. forms an excellent lotion. When the inflammation has subsided a little, liniments containing camphor may be used. In cases where there is no danger of serious inflamma- tion, and the chief indication is to promote the absorption of extravasated fluid, bandages act very beneficially, by the remarkable power which they have of exciting the ac- tion of the lymphatics, by means of the pressure which they produce.

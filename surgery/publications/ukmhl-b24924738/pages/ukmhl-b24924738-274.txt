338 FIRST LINES OF TIIE H will only be possible to notice in this work a few me- dicines, which seem to deserve a trial, in preference to many others. The solution of arsenic may be taken internally, in the way mentioned in the chapter on ulcers. Arsenic may also be safely exhibited in the following formula : R, Kali arsenicati, gr. ij. An. menth. sativ. Jjiv. Spir. vin. ten. fj.—Miscc et cola. Dosis 3 ij ter quotidie. Jn other instances we may exhibit twice a day a pill, containing a grain of calomel, a grain of the sulphur an- thii. pro: dp., and two grains ot the resin of gum guaia- cum. Sometimes the decoction of sarsaparilla, and a pill composed of three or four grains of the succus cicutos spis- solus, and a grain of calomel, given thrice a day, liave ap- parently produced very good eifoefs. iEthiops mineral is alscrsometimes useful.

The , solution of lunar caustic Oj to *fs. of water) may be ap- ■ plied by dipping very small, soft pieces of lint in it, pla- cing them accmately on the little ulcerations by means of a probe; and then covering (he nose w ith a pledget of the wig. sperm, cel., or, if judged necessary, one of the oint- ments above enumerated. The solution of arsenic, men- tioned in the chapter on ulcers, may be used in the same maimer. In some instances it answers better to touch the little sores with the lunar caustic itself, before covering them with a dressing. The scabs slipukl be, every now and then, softened with the ung. sperm, cet., and removed with as little irritation as possible.

practice of surgery. 95 before biting the patient, may have bitten something else, so as to have emptied the poison-bags completely. The bite may have taken place through clothes, and great part of the poison may have lodged on them. Though the poison may be lodged in the wound there may be a tardiness of absorption, and the virus may there- fore be washed off by suppuration without having affected the constitution. Or the means made use of may ha"\c iC- moved it completely from the wound. The narrowness of the injury is, however, very unfavourable to any attempt of this kind. The bad symptoms usually commence in about twelve or fifteen hours. An acute pain, and a burning heat, are experienced in the,part affected, which begins to swell. I he tumefaction, tension, heat, and pain, gradually spicad over the whole limb, and, in some cases, the whole body is said to be swollen. Dejection of spirits ; smallness and weakness of the pulse ; headache, nausea, and vomiting ensue. A fixed pain is felt in the region of the heart, and all the surface of the body assumes a yellow tinge. The urine seems as if it were impregnated with bile. Cold per- spirations and convulsions take place, and death some- times finishes the tragedy. â€¢The bite of the viper seldom proves fatal in this country. It might, however, kill a child, though it does not ge- nerally destroy an adult; for Fontana makes it appear probable, that the danger is in proportion to the smallness of the animal bitten. It has been attempted to investigate the nature oi the poison, but hitherto without any practical good. M e a;e told by Dr. Mead and Fontana, that it is neither of an acid, nor alkaline nature. Fontana suspects the faintness following the injury to proceed very frequently from fear, and he even thinks, it may have a considerable effect in occasionally producing death.

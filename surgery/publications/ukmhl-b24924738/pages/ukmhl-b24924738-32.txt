2 FIRST LINES OF THE vessels. The swelling seems l-eferrible : 1. To the dilata- tion of the vessels ; 2. To the plethoric state of the ar- teries and veins ; 3. To the exudation of coagulating lymph into the interstices of the cellular subtance.; 4. To the interruption of absorption. (See Soemmering de morb. vasor. absorb.) With regard 'to the augmentation ot heat in inflammation,- it appears from Hunter’s experi- ments, that the temperature of the part affected is not raised nearly so hig'h as one might suppose from an abs- tract consideration of the patient’s feelings. Let us re- membci, that the sensibility of the nerves is augmented, and we shall no longer be surprised, that they should con- vey to the sensorium false impressions. It is more easy to conceive, than describe, how any deviation from the na- tuial state of parts must excite pain. It is the unusual condition, into which the nerves are thrown, which is to be regarded as the proximate cause. In chronic inflam- mation the gradually cf the change allows the nerve* to become adapted to it, and the degree of pain only amounts to a dull, uneasy sensation ; but, as in phlegmon, the change is quick, the pain is considerable. The throbbing manifestly depends on the strong pulsation of the arteries. CAUSES. I he remote, or occasional causes are exceedingly nu- merous ; but, as they mostly rank in the class of external violence from mechanical, or chemical means, no particu- lar detail of them seems necessary. The irritation of fe- vers would often appear to be a remote cause. The idea, however, that the inflammation, thus occasioned, is cri- tical, or in any way conducive to the cure of the consti- tutional disorder, does not seem to be established on a tenable basis. Sometimes inflammation arises spontane- ously, or to speak more correctly, no perceptible cause can be assigned for it. T he proximate cause has been the subject of much VW*

91 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. DRESSINGS FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS, AND CONSTITUTIONAL* treatment. From the degree of.contusion, laceration, and sloughing, produced in almost all gunshot wounds, no hope of union by the first intention can be entertained. If we except the employment of means to moderate inflammation, and the measures noticed in the preceding section, the surgeon is not required to take any very active part iu the treatment, at least during the inflammatory stage. The dressings are to be of the mildest description possible; a pledget of white cerate, and an emollient poultice, are the best applications. What good can introducing lint into the orifice ot a gun- shot wound produce ? Is this practice designed to prevent its closure ? If it is, the idea is absurd, as gunshot wounds are not very apt to unite by the adhesive inflammation. Fomenting the part, two or three times a day, with a de- coction of white poppies, deserves recommendation ; for it always diminishes pain, and consequently must have a good effect on the inflammation. The consolidation of a gunshot wound is the work ot nature. The steps she takes to effect it have been noticed iu treating of granulations. A suppurated gunshot wound is only an abscess, in which there are frequently extraneous bodies. To maintain a ready exit for the pus, and to remove all extraneous mat- ter that is loose, and sufficiently near the surface of the body, is all (hat the surgeon can usefully do. During the inflammatory stage, the application of leeches to the neighbourhood of the wound, and venesec- tion, are highly commendable. In short, every thing re- commended for inflammation is to be adopted. OF WHAT IS TO BE DONE WHEN A CANNON BALL HAS ' TORN OFF A LIMB. In this case some advise the amputation of the stump to procure the patient an eycn, smooth incision, instead of an

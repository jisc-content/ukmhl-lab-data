FIRST LINES OF THE 348 fseces, bile, urine, blood, &c. according to the nature of the injured part. There are three distinct and successive classes of bad symptoms, resulting from the effusion of blood in the ab- domen. 1. l he first class depends on the loss of blood itself, and consists of paleness, faintness, sinking pulse, and swooning. 2. The second arises from the presence of blood in the cavity of the peritoneum, and consists of a swelling of the abdomen, and sundry inconveniences produced by the pressure of the extravasated blood on the viscera. If the quantity of blood be small, the inconvenience will be so slight as not <o be noticed. 3. The third is produced by the irritation of the blood in the abdomen. But this irritation can only arise from the putrified state of the extravasated fluid, when the external air has free access to it. In whatever way its presence ir- ritates, we sometimes see local pain, spasms, fever, inflam- mation, hiccough, vomiting, suppuration, and sometimes swelling, and a fluctuation, the effects of its lodgment in the cavity ofthe abdomen. Extravasated urine, bile, and the contents ofthe stomach and intestines, produce a higher and more rapid degree of irritation than effused blood. But, whatever is the nature of the fluid extravasated in the abdomen, the chief consequences are of the third de- scription, and are all of the inflammatory kind, inducing hazard of suppuration and gangrene. The irritation, arising from the quality of the .effused fluid ; the pressure and distention, resulting from its quantify, are sufficient to account for the origin of such mischievous effects. The symptoms, caused by wounds of parts contained in fhe abdomen, may either appear immediately or sometime afterwards, and they are of two kinds, local and consti- tutional.

}#8 FIRST LINES OF THE CHAP. XXII. ' â€¢ / - X CONTUSIONS. A CONTUSION is an injury occasioned by (lie im- pulse of a blunt instrument against any part of tile body, the skin remaining unlacerated. The consequences of such violence are a diminution of the tone of the injured fibres, and a rupture of an infinite number of small vessels. The bruised muscles are weak- ened, and cannot be exerted without pain : and the extra- vasation of blood causes swelling, and discolouration of the skin. Sometimes Vessels of considerable size are rup- tured by the force, and very copious accumulations of ef- fused blood are the result. In contusions of the head we often see the scalp enormously elevated by hemorrhage be- neath it, and large collections of blood are frequently found exlravasated in the cellular substance of almost any situation in the body. Very violent contusions not only affect parts on which the force immediately falls, they extend eveu to such as are remote from the place which was struck. The second sort of contusion is what the French have termed a contre-coup, in which the injury is to be imputed to the elfect of a for- cible concussion. The mischievous effects of a contusion are not always proportioned to the force applied ; they often depend on the nature of the injured part. If the bruise take place on a bone, which is thinly covered with soft, parts, the latter always suffer very severely in consequence of being wound- ed, at the time of the accident, between two hard bodies. Hence bruises of the shin so frequently cause sloughing, and troublesome sores.

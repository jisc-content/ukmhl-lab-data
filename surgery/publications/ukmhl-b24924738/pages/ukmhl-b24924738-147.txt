PRACTICE OF SURGERY. H5 The danger of hemorrhage may always be lessened, as was before mentioned, by slowly twisting the polypus at its root, instead of pulling it directly out. When only a portion of the tumour has been extracted, the surest mode of checking the bleeding is to extract the remaining part without delay. If, when the polypus has given way at its root, the bleeding should be profuse, we may first try ice- cold water, or brandy, which may be injected into the nose. If the hemorrhage should still continue, it may always be checked to a certainty, how copious soever it may be, in the following manner : Roll a considerable piece of lint round the end of a probe; wet it completely through with a strong solution of zincum vitriolatum ; introduce it into the nostril, and press it as strongly as possible against the part whence the blood issues. As soon as the blood ceases to flow we may conclude that the pressure acts on the bleed- ing point. This plan is almost invariably successful. When the source of the blood lies very deeply in the nostril, it might be difficult to direct pressure precisely against it. At all events, we may then pass a piece of cat- gut through the nostril, and bring it out of the mouth by means of a pair of forceps ; a roll of lint may next be fastened to the ligature, and drawn through the mouth into the nose, so as to completely stop the posterior aperture of the nostril. The front opening may be filled with a suffi- cient quant ity of lint. It is generally deemed prudent only to attempt the ex- traction of such polypi as are of a pale, greyish, 01 light- brown colour ; are trivially, or not at all, painful, unless when pressed; increase in damp rveather, and diminish m dry ; move backward and forward in respiration ; and round the anteriour part of which a probe may be freely passed. We are advised not to extract those which arc attend* d i 2

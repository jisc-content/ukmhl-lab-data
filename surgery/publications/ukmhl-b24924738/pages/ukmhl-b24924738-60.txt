30 FIRST LINES OF THE mortification; and when we consider the debilitated and disordered condition, into which the whole system is thrown by the death of a part, it is a matter of no surprise. Bark, conjoined with the vitriolic W, lias been very generally considered as a most effectu d remedy for stop- ping the progress of mortification. But, it is very wrong to employ bark indiscriminately in all cases. In some it is unnecessary ; in some, ineffectual; in others, hurtful. When mortification happens from an external local in- jury in a sound constitution ; when it no longer spreads, and the living margin appears red, for a small distance fiom the line of separation ; bark is clearly unnecessary. Mortification is attended with fever of three kinds : 1. Sympathetic inflammatory fever. 2. One accompanied with extreme debility, being probably of a typhoid na- ture. 3. One depending on derangement of the cbylo- poietic organs. , The first takes place when the mortification is the conse- quence of healthy acute inflammation, which has been pro- duced by an external injury in a healthy constitution. Here bark is usually hurtful. 1 lie second fever certainly requires bark. In the third, however, as the indication is to empty the ptima via, bark is not likely to prove serviceable. Sometimes inflammation has less share in the origin of the mortification than some other proximate cause, which may demand the administration of bark. In the course of the case, also, circumstances may change so much, that though this medicine were at first improper, it may after- wards become useful. So long as sympathetic inflammatory fever, and local inflammation, are co-existent with mortification, the anti- phlogistic treatment is indicated. But much circumspec- tion is necessary in its adoption ; for the change from the inflammatory into a low fever, with exfreme debility, is commonly in these cases very sudden. Evacuations, in-

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 197 and it begins with a dull, heavy, deeply-seated pain, the limb appearing outwardly quite sound. In general the disease is not ascertained before the affected bone becomes expanded. At length the matter arrives beneath the peri- osteum, and a tumour resembling a deep-seated abscess is produced. As soon as the nature of the case is ascertained, the mat- ter ought to be evacuated through a perforation made into the bone with a small trephine. Unfortunately it is difficult to know the early existence of the disorder with certainty. Exfoliation generally takes place before the termination of the case. Amputation ought not to be practised, unless the immediate preservation of life should be at stake. Bark, wine, good air, and nourishing diet, are peculiarly necessary in this tedious and debilitating sort of case. Analogous to the spina ventosa is the formation of mat- ter in the medullary structure of the cranium, in conse- quence of a violent blow on the head. As the matter is secreted it spreads throughout the diploe, and at length portions both of the external and internal table of the skull are absorbed, so as to form numerous foramina, and allow the pus to insinuate itself between the cranium and dura mater, or beneath the pericranium. In this case an opening should be made with the trephine very early, in order to prevent the diffusion of mischief. NECROSIS, EXFOLIATIONS, &C. The death of a whole bone, or chief part of one, is term- ed necrosis ; the same affection of a smaller portion is de- nominated an exfoliation, or caries. When necrosis occurs, new bony matter is frequently deposited around the dead bone, and in time the latter is removed by the absorbents. These vessels seem, however, to act with energy in the accomplishment of this work, only when the external ulcerations are very small, or quisle

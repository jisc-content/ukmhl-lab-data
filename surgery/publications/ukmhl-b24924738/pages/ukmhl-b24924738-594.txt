FIRST LINES OF THE 550 fici?.I examiner r the hand becomes considerably distorted, whenever one of the lateral ligaments of the wrist is rup- tured. in cases, in which great violence has operated, the carpal bones are sometimes thrown before, or behind the radius. There is never much difficultly in reducing dislocations of the wrist. When the articular-surfaces are put in a proper situation, in regard to each other, a splint should be applied along the inside of the forearm, and palm of the 1 and, in order to keep the wrist from moving. I need hardly mention the propriety of wearing a sling. When the thumb or fingers are dislocated, they are to be reduced, and incased and supported in pasteboard, the hand and forearm being kept in a sling, till a cure is effected. DISLOCATIONS OF THE THIGH BONE. The most frequent case is that in w hich the head of'the os fern oris is dislocated on the obturator foramen, that is, downward and forward. This kind of accident is the most common, because the brim of the acetabulum is not so high in the above direction, and the ligamentum teres is in- serted so near the notch, which faces the obturator fora- men, that the head of the bone can descend in the above way, without the ligament itself being ruptured. The case, which ranks next in regard to frequency, is that in which the head of the thigh bone is dislocated to- wards the sacro-iscliiatic foramen, the great trochanter being situated forward, and the limb being turned inward. The most rare kind of dislocation is that, in which the head of the os femoris is thrown on the dorsum of the ilium, in such a manner, that the trochanter major projects backward, while the head of the bone is situated obliquely forward. Many surgeons of great experience have never seen this case. However, there is no doubt of its occasional occurrence, as my own observation enables me to state : a thin lad, about fourteen ^cars old, was

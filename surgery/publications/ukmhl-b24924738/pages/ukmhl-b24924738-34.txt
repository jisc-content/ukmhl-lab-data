FIRST LINES OF THE 4 which the doctrine rests, we shall find, that the suppres- sion of secretion forms the chief argument in its support. But, in mild inflammations of secreting parts and sur- faces, the secretion is generally augmented. In violent cases alone secretion is stopped, and we must infer that there is then a constriction of those minute extre- mities of the vessels, which are concerned in that pro- cess. There is not the smallest evidence, however, in any cases, that such a constriction ever affects, either the venous extremities of the arteries, or those, whicli are destined to deposit the new matter of the body. A very striking circumstance, attending phlegmonous and other inflammations, wheresoever situated, is their be- ing always most violent on the side next to the external surface of the body. If inflammation invade the socket of a tooth, it chiefly takes place towards the cheek, and not on the inside of the alveolary process. The situation, position, structure, functions, and dis- tance of the part affected from the source of the circulation, cause considerable variety in the progress, and termina- tion of all inflammation. Parts that enjoy a vigorous circulation of blood through them, can bear inflammation better, than others oppo- sitely circumstanced. But, vital parts, though exceed- ingly vascular, do not undergo inflammation favourably ; because, as Hunter remarks, the natural operations of uni- versal health, depend so much on their sound condition. The depending position of a part seems to have a bad effect on inflammation, probably by retarding the return of blood. New-formed parts possess less vitality, than such as constitute a portion of the original fabric of the body, and, consequently, they are very liable to be absorbed, or mor- tify, when inflamed. During the existence of inflammation, blood taken away by the lancet, has a particular appearance on its surface, I

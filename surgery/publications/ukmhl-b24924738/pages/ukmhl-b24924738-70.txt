To promote the absorption of the extra- vasated fluid, and to re-establish the original tone of the vessels, are always, however, grand indications. The limb should be kept in an horizontal position. Frictions made on the part with flannel, fumigated with aromatic vapours ; the application of camomile flowers, and preparations containing camphor ; and a moderately tight roller, tend strongly to rouse the absorbents into action. The operation of these means is considerably assisted by giving internally purgatives, diuretics, and emetics. If the tumour should not soften under this plan, but be- come so tense as to occasion pain, inflammation, and the clanger of gangrene, the fluid may be discharged by means of a small puncture. A puncture is, however, not void of danger, for wounds, in dropsical constitutions, and parts, easily become gangrenous. The punctures, therefore, should be as small as possible. When the cedematous part is inflamed, every thing in the least irritating should be removed. No bandages should now be employed. 1 lie limb should be placed in a horizontal position, and covered with the lot. aq. litharg. acet. Cooling purga- tives are to be given, and the antiphlogistic regimen ob- served. Such inflammation is apt to occasion dangerous sloughing. Electricity is useful in cases unattended with inflamma- tion.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 335- heart was pushed quite to the right side of the chest by a collection of matter in the left bag of the pleura.- The pre- ceding existence of inflammation in the chest, the occur- rence of rigors, and the palpitations of the heart quite on the right side of the thorax, enabled me to foretel the na- ture of the case before tLe man died. With regard to the place which is the most proper for making an opening into the chest, a few words are neces- sary, because some very excellent modern surgeons, and among them Bertrandi, disregarding every other considera-. tion but that of making a depending aperture, advise us to perform the operation between the third and fourth false ribs, counting from the last, and about four or five finger- breadths from the spine. But every object can be effec- tually obtained by making an opening more forward, where there are no muscles, except the intcrcostals, to be divided. The most eligible place is between the sixth and seventh true ribs, just at that point where the indigitations of the serralus major anticus terminate. By placing the patient on his abdomen, this opening may be rendered a very depending one. An incision about three inches long must be made through the integuments. These are first to be drawn lo one side, if it be intended to close the wound immediately afterwards. The intercostal muscles are next to lie cau- tiously divided, and a small puncture carefully made in the pleura eostalis, as soon as it is exposed. The inter- costal muscles must be divided closely to the upper edge of the lower rib, in order to avoid any chance of wounding the intercostal artery, which runs in a groove along the lower edge of the upper rib. In emphysematous cases a small puncture will gene- rally suffice; iu hydrops pectoris it maybe made somewhat larger; and in empyema the matter must have an opening of sufficient size to allow the fluid to escape freely, and a cannula, to be afterwards introduced.

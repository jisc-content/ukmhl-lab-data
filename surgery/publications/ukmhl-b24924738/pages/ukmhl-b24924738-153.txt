At first a very slender piece, and afterwards a larger and larger one, is to be used. Some advise using flexible tubes. POLYPI OP THE UTERUS Are of three kinds, in respect to situation. They cither grow from the fundus, the inside of the cervix, or from the lower edge of the os uteri. The first case is the most fre- quent, the last the most uncommon. Polypi of the uterus are always shaped like a pear, and have a thin pedicle. They are almost invariably of that species which is deno- minated fleshy; hardly ever being scirrhous, cancerous, or ulcerated. The polypus growing from the fundus uteri is very dif- ficult to detect in its incipient state. While small it pro- duces not the smallest perceptible change in the organs of generation. As it enlarges it distends the. uterus, and often excites a suspicion of pregnancy, which, however, a more attentive investigation soon dispels. The swelling of the abdomen does not take place in the degree, and space of time, which it docs in gestation ; the menses continue to flow: the breasts do not become full; and, in the pro- gress of the case, no motion is to be felt. While thapo- lypus lies in the uterus i!s growth is slow. Even at this early period it frequently occasions profuse bleeding. Wo- men afflicted with the disease are seldom pregnant: and when they are so, parturition commonly happens prema- turely. Sometimes, however, delivery takes place in the regular manner. As the polypus increases it expands the os uteri, and at length protrudes into the vagina. Sometimes this event is preceded by pains similar to those of labour. When the tumour has arrived in its new situation, as it is no longer

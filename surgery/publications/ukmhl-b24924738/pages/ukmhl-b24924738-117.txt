PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 85 and an universal derangement of all the animal functions, instantaneous loss of all the senses, swooning, and incapa- city to move, arc the ordinary effects immediately pro- duced on the system by such a violent species of injury. Authors are even inclined not to limit the consequences of the shock to what I have stated ; but mention inflammation and suppuration of the liver, lungs, See. as sometimes en- suing from it. TREATMENT OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS. The first thing in the treatment of a gunshot wound in one of the extremities, is to determine whether it is more advisable to amputate the wounded limb immediately, or to undertake the cure of the wound. When a bone, especially at a joint, is shattered into nu- merous fragments ; when the soft parts are, at the same time, extensively contused and lacerated, with injury of an important blood vessel and nerves : when the whole limb is thrown into a cold and insensible condition by the violence of the shock ; no resource is so safe as amputa- tion : and to delay, under such circumstances, would lead to almost certain death. But below this violent pitch of injury, in which the ne- cessity of amputation is visible to every eye, there are se- veral inferior degrees, where the soundest judgment is re- quired to form a prudent determination. In many of these cases the scale is so delicately ba- lanced, that an opinion is not to be formed from a consi- deration of the injury alone. The patientâ€™s constitution ; the possibility, or impossibility, of procuring good accom- modation, rest, attendance, and pure air, arc matters that ought to have immense weight in dubious cases. Gunshot wounds rank as accidents. Every surgeon knows, that a man who has been long habituated to dis- ease, is more likely to bear an operation well than another

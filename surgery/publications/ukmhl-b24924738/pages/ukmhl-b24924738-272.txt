236 FIRST LINES OF THE all the leeth aic sound, the third or fourth grinder is to be selected. Theie are cases in which fleshy, or bony funguses, or de- tached portions of dead bone, are situated in the antrum, and in which it is requisite to make a larger opening into this cavity, than can be obtained at its lower part. In- stances also occur in which the patients have lost the grind- ing teeth, and the sockets are quite obliterated, so that a perforation from below could hardly be effected. In such Circumstances an opening may be made into the antrum with a small trephine, through the malar process of the su- perior maxillary bone. The detachment of carious portions of bone is altoge- ther the work of nature : the only way in which the sur- geon can be useful, being’ to extract, through proper inci- sions, such exfoliations as are already loose. The fistulous Sinuses generally require dilating, to allow the pieces of bone to be taken away. If there be no caries, the ulcera- tions generally heal spontaneously, when the matter in the antrum lias a depending opening, through which it can escape. / • ' FUNGUSES OF THE ANTRUM. The worst diseases to which the antrum is liable are fun- gous, and other, tumours growing in its cavity, and pro- ducing first an enlargement, and then a destruction of its bony parietes. These frequently cause all the neighbour- ing teeth to fall out, and the eye to be displaced from its socket. The excrescence makes its way through (he al- veolary processes into the mouth, and, by expanding the bones, renders the adjacent nostril quite obstructed.' At last the excrescence makes its way through the cheek, and assumes a very frightful aspect. The pro per mode of treating this case is to trephine the antrum as soon as the existence of the disease is known; and to make such a free opening into the cavity, that every

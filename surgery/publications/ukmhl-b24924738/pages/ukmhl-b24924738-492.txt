FIRST LINES OF TIIE 450 may be productive of such irritation in the urinary pas- sages, as shall occasion (hem (o become spasmodically af- fccled. But the most frequent exciting cause of the spas- modic, or inflammatory retention of urine, is the irritation produced by strictures, and virulent gonorrhoeas. From this account, it is manifest, that besides taking care to em- ploy antiphlogistic and antispasmodic remedies, it is also necessary to pay attention to each particular cause of the irritation. The most potent means for relieving the retention of ui ine, non under consideration, are, copious venesections ; the application of leeches to the perineum, or vicinity of the os pubis; the exhibition of opium by the mouth, and in clysters; the warm bath ; and fomentations to the hy- pogastric region, and perineum. Some also recommend rubbing the latter part with an embrocation, composed of hartshorn, camphor, and tinct. opii. When these measures have been fairly tried, without suc- cess, the catheter is to be used without delay. The conti- nued lodgment of the urine, and the distention, arising from its quantity, may soon cause the paralytic affection of the bladder, already noticed, and even occasion, in the course of three or four days, sloughing, and a fatal extravasation of the urine. When no kind of ca- theter can be introduced, not even a small one made of clas- tic gum, and the other remedies are unavailing, it becomes necessary to puncture the bladder, in the way which we shall next describe.

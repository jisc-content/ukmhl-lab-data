PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 365 tumour lias a flabby, unequal feel; and, when there is ju> stricture, is perfectly indolent. It is more compressible than that arising from protruded intestine; and when the quantity of omentum is large, the epiplocele may, in some measure, be /distinguished by its weight. Xn an enterocele the tumour is usually more flatulent and elastic. If the intestine be distended with wind, have any degree of stricture made on it, or be inflamed, the swelling will be tense, resist the impression of the fingers, and give pain upon being handled. On the contrary, if there be no stricture, and the gut be neither distended with air, nor in- flamed, the tension will be trivial, juul no pain will occur upon handling the tumour. When the patient coughs, an enterocele feels, as Mr. Pott observes, just as if it were blown into. When an intestine, containing air, is re- duced, it frequently occasions a guggling noise. In the entero-epiplocele, of course, the symptoms arc mixed. Some herniac are capable of easy and immediate reduc- tion. This is usually the case when the aperture, through which the parts protrude, is not so small as to produce constriction, and when these same parts have not contract- ed any adhesions. In old cases of epiplocele, the omentum frequently cannot be reduced, in consequence of tiie mor- bid enlargement which the protruded portion has under- gone, even though its neck may not sutler any degree of stricture. When hernias can be reduced by the hand, this ought always to be done ; and the patient should afterwards con- stantly retain the parts in their natural situation by wear- ing a truss. Many hernia1 are incapable of being reduced, though not in a state of strangulation or inflammation. The incapa- city of reduction, in this sort of case, is commonly ow ing to the largeness and quantity of the contents of the hernial sac; to a morbid thickening and enlargement of them;

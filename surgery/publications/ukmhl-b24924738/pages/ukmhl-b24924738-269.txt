A course of emetic and purgative medicines has sometimes accom- plished a cure. Black hellebore, internally administered, is said to be particularly efficacious in many instances. Very foul ulcers on the lips arc occasionally quite depend- ent on the projection of a sharp, rough tooth against the parts. The under lip is commonly the scat of cancer, the upper one being but seldom affected. Whenever there is reason to believe that the disease is of an unyielding cancerous nature, the sooner it is extirpated the better. For this purpose some surgeons admit the pro*, priety of using caustic, when the whole disease can be completely destroyed by one application. But as the ac- tion of caustic is not capable of being regulated with so much precision, as the extent of a wound can be, the knife is generally preferable: it is also the least painful. The operation should be done as tor the hare lip, making the wound of such a shape as will allow its edges to be

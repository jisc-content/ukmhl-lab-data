70 FIRST LINES OF THE in wounds made with sharp cutting instruments, and, when ligamentous expansions are among the objects of injury, both the structure ot the wounded parts, and the nature of the wound itself, often produce a train of severe local and constitutional symptoms. When an artery of consequence is punctured, the hemorrhage must be sup- pressed, either by exposing the vessel and tying it, or by applying graduated compresses and a bandage. The choice of these means must be determined by considera- tions, already hinted at in a preceding chapter. Immense agitation of the nervous system very often follows the in-? diction of a punctured wound, and this has been attributed to the injury o 1 tendons, or nerves. This doctrine is now almost quite exploded, as surgeons so frequently see nerves and tendons wounded without the occurrence of great constitutional disorder, in five cases out of a hundred. The explanation of tire fact, that great derangement of the system is very apt to follow punctured wounds, is not yet unfolded in a satisfactory manner ; but the fact itself is fully established on the surgical records of all ages, and the firm basis of daily experience. Punctured wounds are frequently very difficult and tardy of cure, on account of their being attended with the formation of deeply-seated abscesses and sinuses. The narrowness of their orifices also renders the extraction of any extraneous bodies by no means easy of accomplish- ment. TREATMENT OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS. In this part of practice erroneous suppositions have very commonly led to very serious abuses. The unlimited idea that the severe consequences of most punctured wounds are in a great measure owing to the narrowness of their orifices, induced numerous surgeons to practise, indis- criminately, deep and extensive incisions, for (he purpose of rendering their external communication considerably

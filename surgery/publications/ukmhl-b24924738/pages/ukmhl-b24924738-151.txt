PRACTICE OF SURGERY. ' 119 ligature are much more serious and numerous. The litter mode of cure is always accomplished with much less expe- dition. When the polypus is so large as to fill the whole nostril, it is generally impracticable to introduce the noose sufficiently far. The figure of the polypus renders it al- most impossible to tie its root; for the tumour commonly expands very much before and behind, and the wire must be carried over the posterior part of the polypus ere it can be applied to its root. In general the noose includes only the front part of the polypus, while the root and back portion remained untied, and consequently do not become detached. The polypus nasi is commonly very sensible, so that ty- ing it proves severely painful. The constriction not only makes the polypus inflame, but the whole extent of the Schneiderian membrane. The pain and inflammation often extend to parts at some distance; such as the throat, eyes, &e. and considerable fever is excited. When the polypus is tied it swells very much* and all the complaints which it previously caused are exasperat- ed. In particular, the part situated in the throat is apt to create such impediment to deglutition and respiration, that prompt relief becomes indispensable. This sta’e is reliev- ed by scarifying the tumour, the size of which dimi- nishes as the blood is evacuated. During the detachment of the polypus the fetid dis- charge must be washed away by repeatedly injecting a so- lution of alum into the nostril. •i * CAUTERY. The cautery, formerly recommended for the cure of the polypus nasi, is now almost entirely rejected j and, in- deed, in the manner it was customary to use it, little good could be done. It was applied to the anteriour surface of the tumour in the nostril; and its employment was repeat- ed every time the slough separated. Its action could na-

3f FIRST LINES OF THE Some external injuries: are inevitably followed by mor- tification.

When the substantial part of the lower extremity has mortified, the formation of a serviceable stump generally renders amputation requisite, as soon as the spreading of the disorder has ceased. Sometimes, however, it is pru- dent to delay the operation a little, until the system has re- vived from its dejected state. CHAP. vr. erysipelas.

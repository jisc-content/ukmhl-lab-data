I Practice of surgery. 3&3 t , strangulated viscera. This experienced surgeon was in- duced to examine repeatedly the parts concerned in the formation of the femoral hernia, from having read Gim- bernat’s work, which describes the part really causing the strangulation. Mr. Hey’s account of the femoral ligament is as fol- lows : the parts descend within the aponeurotic sheath, which envelopes the great vessels ol the thigh, and which is strongly attached at its superior part to the os pubis. The anterior layer of this sheath is formed, in part, by a continuation of the fascia of the abdominal muscles passing down upon the thigh. About three-eighths of an inch below Poupart’s ligament there exists in this aponeurotic sheath another ligament, somewhat similar to that ol Poupart, but smaller. It runs transversely, but does flot descend obliquely as that ligament does. On (he contrary, it ra- ther ascends towards the symphysis of the pubis, passing, behind and decussating the extremity ol Poupart’s liga- ment. It docs not lie in the same plane as the latter part, but more deeply. Gimbernat has termed the space beneath Poupart’s liga- ment the crural arch. The anterior crural nerve always passes on the outside of the abovementioned sheath to- wards its external and posterior part. Before the external iliac artery enters it sends off the epigastric. This vessel passes obliquely inward, between the crural arch and '.spermatic vessels. On the inside of the cavity of the sheath, and immediately on the inside of the great iliac vein, there is a foramen, sufficiently distinct, almost round, at which many lymphatics enter. It is sometimes stopped up by a lymphatic gland ; but the parts which form the crural hernia always pass through it, and consequently Gimbernat calls it the crural ring. Having laid open the hernial sac in the manner above recommended, a director should next be introduced within the crural ring, on that side of the intestine, or omentum,

The same symptoms, which occasionally result from fractures of the ribs, may follow dislocations, and will re- quire such treatment, as was explained in the preceding chapter. When a rib is forcibly separated from its cartilage, or this from the sternum, the case demands the same treat- ment as a fracture. dislocation of the clavicle. Fractures of the clavicle are much more common than dislocations, as any one might easily infer, who considers the slender structure, and exposed position, of the bone, and the direction in which external force will commonly operate upon it. A dislocation is much more common at the sternal, than the scapular, extremity of the clavicle, on account of the greater degree of motion, which takes place at the former situation, and the weaker structure of the ligaments, than at the articulation with the acromion. When a dislocation happens at the sternum, the clavicle is usually thrown forward; sometimes, however, back- ward, in which event, the symptoms are commonly severe, on account of the pressure produced by the bone on the parts situated in the anterior part of the neck. The dislocation of the scapular end of the clavicle is always upwards; for the root of the coracoid process, on which it rests, will not allow the bone to descend below the acromion. A luxation of the clavicle frem the scapula is liable to be mistaken for a dislocation, of (he os brachii, in consequence of the front and upper portion of the deltoid muscle becoming flattened, and there being an apparent depression at the top of the shoulder.

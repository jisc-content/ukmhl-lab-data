FIRST LINES OF TIIE CHAP. xxv. tracheotom y. THIS operation is performed for various purpose* ; 1st, 115 orc^er to bc able <0 lnfiafe the lungs, in cases of suffoca- tion,.drowning, &c. ; 2dly, to make an artificial opening, through which respiration may be carried on, when the natural passage for the air through the mouth and nose is so obstructed, that the patient is threatened with suffo- cation ; 3dly, tracheotomy is practised for extracting foreign bodies, which have accidentally fallen into the. trachea. It is proper to distend the lungs with air, in all cases where animation has been recently suspended by immer- sion under water, or by noxious vapours. This measure is highly proper in conjunction with electricity, the com- munication of caloric to the body, the application of strong volatiles to the nostrils, and the injection of some such beverage, ns warm wane into the stomach, by means of a liollow bougie. From the manner in which the epi- glottis covers the top of the larynx, it is obviously very inconvenient to make any attempt to introduce the muzzle of a pair of bellows into the rima ,g!ottidis frven though the pipe be curved). It is much better to have recourse at once to a very safe and simple operation, which con- sists in making an opening into the front of the trachea, sufficient to admit the pipe of the bellows. The surgeon is obliged to make an artificial opening into the trachea to enable the patient to respire, when the l itter is prevented from doing so, in the natural way, by diseases and tumours about the back of the throat, the larynx, and upper portion of the trachea. As suffocation would inevitably follow the neglect to make an opening

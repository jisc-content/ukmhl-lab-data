PRACTICE OF SURGERY. ** Here opium is also a valuable medicine, not only pro- curing sleep, and alleviating pain, but acting as one of the best remedies for checking the diarrhoea frequently present. CHAP. V. mortification. . / » WE have regarded inflammation as an increased action of the arteries concerned. If the part have sufficient powers to undergo the preternatural excitement, resolu- tion or suppuration is the result. But when the vehe- mence of the action is altogether disproportioned to the vital power of the inflamed part, or when its duration baa exhausted this power so much that the vessels can no longer act at all, mortification necessarily takes place. Some- times in this circumstance, ulceration supersedes the ne- cessity for mortification, by removing parts back into the system. SYMPTOMS.—TWO STAGES OF MORTIFICATION, &C. The symptoms of an incipient mortification are : First, a sudden diminution of the pain and sympathetic fever ; Secondly, a livid discolouration of the part, which, from being yellowish, becomes of a greenish hue ; Thirdly, de- tachment of the cuticle, under which a turbid fluid is ef- fused ; Fourthly, the swelling, tension, and hardness sub- side, and, on touching the part, a crepitus is perceptible, owing to the generation of air in the cellular substance. While the disease is in this stage it is termed gangrene. When the part has become quite black and fibrous, and destitute of motion, sensation, and natural heat, the dis- ease is then denominated sphacelus.

Indeed compound fractures do so much better in the country than in this large metropolis, and patients bear so much better the rigorous employment of antiphlogistic measures, that it is right to attempt the preservation of numerous limbs out of town, which in London would re- quire amputation. CHAP. XL. DISLOCATIONS. T) â€™ WHEN the articular surfaces of bones are thrown out of their particular places, the accident is termed a disloca- tion , or luxation. Dislocations are divided, like fractures, into two princi- pal kinds ; viz. simple and compound: simple, when there is no externa} wound communicating with the cavity of the dislocated joint; compound, when the injury is attended with a wound of this description. Luxations have also been distinguished into ancient, and recent; complete, and incomplete. The diagnostic marks of dislocations chiefly consist of circumstances arising from the functions of the affected joint being interrupted; and the lodgment of the articular extremity of a bone in an unnatural situation, and among parts which it compresses and renders painful. Hence there is a loss of motiojj in t he joint; the limb, or part, is either shortened, lengthened, or distorted to one side, ac- cording to the kind of dislocation ; the pressure of the dislocated head of the bone on the surrounding parts causes p

216 FIRST LINES OF THE' ncalh »!]crc the external violence has operated with most force that «, beneath lire fraclurc, yet it not „„fe. quenlly lies tn a remote part. The same violence which reaks tile cranium may occasion a concussion of the brain an extravasation of blood beneath the cranium, and a sub- sequent inflammation of the brain and its membranes. Fractures, with considerable depression of the bone are sometimes unattended with alarming symptoms; and, in this circumstance, the application of the trephine is unne- cessary. We shall see from what follows that there can only be one genuine reason for trephining, vis. to remove such pressure from the surface of the brain, as gives rise to existing bad symptoms. The only treatment which a fracture of the skull requires consists in taking- measures to guard against the inflamma- tion of the brain ; a consequence which is sometimes caused by the mechanical irritation of the fracture, but, in most instances, by the same violence which broke the bone itself If we could ascertain that the inequalities, or pressure, of1 t e fracture, caused the bad symptoms, we should be war- ranted in removing the fractured part with a trephine; but all we can rationally do, in common cases, is to bleed tuie patient freely and repeatedly from the temporal ar- tery and the arm, and prescribe saline purgative medicines and a low diet. The antiphlogistic regimen should be continued at least a month; for it is by no means uncom- mon for inflammation of the brain to follow injuries of the hea l, a very considerable time after the patients have had reason to suppose themselves in perfect safety. / PRESSURE ON THE BRAIN FROM EXTRAVASATION. External violence, applied to the head, very frequently occasions a rupture of the spinous, or some other, artery of the dura mater ; and a large quantify of blood becomes effused on the surface of this membrane beneath the cra- Bium.

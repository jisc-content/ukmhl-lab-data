Until the complaint is permanently cured, the eye should be protected by a shade from exposure to strong light. HORDEOLUM, OR STYE. The tumours of the eyelids are of various kinds. The stye is always situated at the edge of the eyelids. It is a very small, circumscribed tumour, about the size of a bar- leycorn. An inflamed stye is commonly very red and pain- ful ; and is very similar, in every respect, to a small boil, or an inflamed encysted tumour. J The cure of the inflamed stye demands the external em- ployment of emollient applications, for the tumour always suppurates ; and the more this is promoted, the sooner is the patient freed from inconvenience. Even when the stye has already suppurated, emollients are the best applica- tions, until the hardness has subsided. When the suppu- ration has terminated, a weak solution of the acetite of lead may be used to disperse the remaining redness and swelling. The indurated stye, as it is called, occasions a gooddeal of inconvenience, by frequently inflaming, and becoming painful: hindering the motion of the eyelids, and prevent- ing the free enjoyment of sight. The best mode of curing this disease is to touch the little induration with the argen- tum nitration, until it is destroyed. ENCYSTED TUMOURS OF T1IE EYELIDS.

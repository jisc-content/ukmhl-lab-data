PRACTICE OF SURGERY. TREATMENT OF THE SYMPATHETIC INFLAMMATORY fever. As the cause of the sympathetic inflammatory fever is the local inflammation, it is obvious, that while we are endeavouring to cure the latter, we are taking the most effectual steps for the relief of the constitutional disorder. But as excessive febrile disturbance may in its turn have a bad effect on the local complaint, it is sometimes proper to endeavour to palliate the constitutional symp- toms by having recourse to such means, as might not be necessary were the inflammation not aggravated by the fever. The frequency, strength, and fulness of the pulse may be diminished by the use of the lancet, the exhibition of saline purgatives, and of such medicines as nitre and sal ammoniac. Bleeding, however, is hardly ever necessary on account of the fever itself, consequently it is never prac- tised with a viewjof altering the state of the pulse, except in cases where the local inflammation is important on account of its extent or situation ; and when the increased action of the whole sanguiferous system might seriously exaspe- rate the local mischief. Here also we should probably use the lancet, on account of the inflammation, were it pos- sible to have at the same time a fever ever so inconsi- derable. In short, if the inflammation should not require bleed- ing, it can never be requisite for the fever, which invariably subsides with the local disturbance. The diminished secretions are to be promoted, and a gentle diaphoresis ought, in particular, to be excited. An * timony is the best medicine for this purpose. When this mineral will not remain in the stomach, the aqua, amiuon. aeet, is an excellent substitute.

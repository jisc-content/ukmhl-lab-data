PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 77 is a deep florid red. When of a livid colour they are commonly unhealthy ; and such an appearance denotes that the circulation of the blood in them is languid. Po- sition produces this livid hue, by retarding the return of blood. This is the reason why some sore legs are so back- ward in healing, when the patients are allowed to stand and walk. Granulations when healthy, and situated on an exposed or flat surface, rise nearly to the level of the surrounding skin, and often a little higher ; but when they exceed this, and assume a growing disposition, they are unhealthy, be- coming soft and spongy, and losing the power of producing new skin. Healthy granulations are always prone to join with each cl her, and their vessels soon begin to inosculate. Granulations do not possess the powers of the original parts of the body ; and, consequently, are very subject to mortify, or be absorbed. These new substances must be supplied w ith nerves and lymphatics ; how tender they frequently are every one knows; and it is equally well known that medicines, ap- plied to the surface of ulcers, sometimes find their way into the circulation by means of absorption. Granulations partake of the same qualities, whether they grow from the surface of a bone, or of the soft parts. It is by the foregoing process that nature fills up the hol- lows of deep wounds, which cannot have their edo-es brought into contact, and it is by the same stÂ»ps that she succeeds in filling up the cavities of abscesses. The worL, however, is not quite reducible to this simplicity. All modern practitioners observe, that as soon as the formation of granulations commences, the diameter of the wound be- comes diminished from every two points of its circumfer- ence, even before any new skin appears to be formed. 1 he natural elasticity of the skin, and the contraction of muscles, satisfactorily account for the separation of the

322 FIRST LINES OF TIIE cent cellular substance, and lymphatic glands, participate in the disease, the base of the swelling sometimes extends from one side of the neck to the other. In some instances only one lobe of the gland is affected. The bronchocele seems to be endemic in several moun- tainous countries; Switzerland, Savoy, Tyrol, Derbyshire, &c. It is most frequent in young persons; and occurs more often in the female than the male sex. Dr. Baillie observes, that when a section is made of the thyroid gland, affected with this disease, the part is found to consist of a number of cells, containing a transparent viscid fluid. The ordinary bronchocele is entirely a local disease, pa- tients usually finding themselves, in other respects, per- fectly well. The tumour itself frequently creates no par- ticular inconvenience, only deformity. Large broncho- celes, however, are frequently attended with obstruction to respiration, and hoarseness of the voice. There is no ma- lignancy in the disease, and the swelling does not readily inflame.. I shall say nothing of causes, as they are involved in great obscurity. It is sometimes undoubtedly connected with a scrophulous habit. TREATMENT OF BRONCHOCELE. The disease, in a recent state, may frequently be cured when inveterate, though it is often capable of being consi- derably diminished, it is hardly ever entirely removed. The most celebrated remedy for bronchocele is burnt sponge, given in the dose of a scruple, two or three times a day. The powder may be made into an electuary with syrup. Some prescribe burnt sponge in the form of a troche.* It is sometimes customary to add a grain of calomel * This is said to be more efficacious when placed under the tongue* and. allowed to dissolve there gradually. / â€ž ,

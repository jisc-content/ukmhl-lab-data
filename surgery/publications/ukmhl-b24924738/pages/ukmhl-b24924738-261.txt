PRACTICE OF SURGERY. ^ from the hernia cerebri, commonly following the operation of the trephine. 4 . This case, which is the most frequently met with, is a tumour which usually takes place a few days after the operation. It protrudes through an ulcerated opening ot the dura mater, and very soon attains the magnitude of a pigeon’s, or hen's egg. Frequent hemorrhages occur as it enlarges, and its surface is commonly darkened with co- agulated blood. In a few cases it is not attended with loss of the mental faculties, though, in most instances, we find that there are coma, insensibility, and other marks of pressure on the brain. # Mr. Abernethy’s observations have tended to explain the nature of this singular malady. It seems to proceed from an injury done to a part of the brain at some distance from its surface, which injury produces a diseased stale of the vessels similar to what occurs in apoplexy. 1 he mor bid state increasing, one or more vessels give way, and an effusion of blood into the substance of the brain follows. This occurrence, if the skull were entire, would probably occasion apoplexy ; but when there is a deficiency of bone, that allows the brain to expand, this viscus and its membranes protrude through the aperture. The dura mater soon ulcerates, and the tumour rapidly increases, in proportion as the internal hemorrhage goes on. At last the pia mater, and stratum ot the brain, covering the effused blood, give way, and the blood oozes out, and I coagulates.* The proper line of surgical conduct, in these cases, is hardly yet determined. Mr. Hill successfully pared ofl the tumour with a knife, in several instances : and patients have been known to tear off the whole tumour, without any particular ill consequences ensuing. AV e should not expect these facts d priori, and considering the history of * M r. C. Bell considers this disease as an organized iungous growth. /

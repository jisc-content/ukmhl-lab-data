PRACTICE OF SURGERY. * 327 -and intercostal muscles are lacerated, part of the air also most commonly gets through the above wounded mem- brane and muscles into the cellular substance on the out- side of the chest, and thence it is sometimes diffused through the same substance over the whole body, so as sometimes to inflate it to an extraordinary degree. The inflation of the cellular substance lias been considered the most dangerous part of the disease i but Mr. Hewson very ably shews that this is a very erroneous supposition. ' This gentleman remarks, that the wound of the pleura and intercostal muscles may sometimes be too small to suffer the air to get readily into the cellular membrane, but may confine a part of it in the cavity of the thorax, so as to compress the lungs, and cause the same symptoms of tightness of the chest, quick breathing, and sense of suffo- cation, which water does in hydrops pectoris, or matter in empyema. One of the most remarkable cases of emphysema is re- lated by Littre (Acad, des Sciences, 1713). The swelling on the chest was eleven inches thick, nine on the abdomen, and four on all other parts of the body, except tlie scalp, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. The patient spit blood, had much difficulty of breathing, and made violent efforts to inspire. So unlimited is the diffusion of air, in some cases, that the cellular substance beneath the conjunctha of the eye has been known to be prodigiously inflated. From what has been stated, it is evident, that fn cases of emphysema the danger does not depend so much on the degree of external swelling, as on the degree of compres- sion produced on the mediastinum, diaphragm, and the luffg of the opposite side. If air does^ not diffuse itself in the cellular substance be- fore the third or fourth day from the accident, there is not ^Â«uich chance of its doing so afterwards, because the extra-

FIRST LINES OF THE 64 ing together the edges of a deep, muscular wound ; but, let it be remembered, that, while it proves effectual in maintaining the edges of the skin in contact, it presents no obstacle to the adoption, at the same time, of a proper po- sition, compresses, and bandages, which are means having more effect on the deeper part of the wound. It is also an error to suppose, that adhesive plaster cannot be used in situations where hair grows, or where the application is apt to become moistened. If the part be well shaved, and perfectly dried at first, the plaster will not become loose so soon as to prove ineffectual. It is generally applied in strips, between every two of which an interspace is recommended to be left for the purpose of allowing discharge to escape. To bring the edges of the wound effectually together, and, at the same time, to cover as little of the w ound as possible, are the objects to which we ought to attend in using adhesive plaster. Hence, when the strips are broad, it is not unfrequent to cut out an oval piece of each strip, just where it crosses the wound. Equal parts of the empl. litharg. and empl. litharg. c. resina, form the composition commonly used in this coun- try. Desault, and some other eminent foreign surgeons, re- commend English gummed taffeta, spread w ith isinglass and a balsam, because it is not irritating, nor so subject to produce erysipelatous complaints, as others composed of diachylon, &c. 4. SUTURES. Of the numerous lands of sutures, practised by the old surgeons, there are now only four ever employed. These are the interrupted, the quilled, and the twisted sutures, with another one named gastrm'aphe. The twisted suture will be spoken of in the chapter on the harelip, and gas- iroraphe will be noticed in that on wounds of the abdo- men.

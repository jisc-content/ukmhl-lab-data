16 FIRST LINES OF THE The opinion, that extravasated blood can in time be* come converted into pus, is equally erroneous. When suppuration is about to take place in the cellular substance, or membranes of circumscribed cavities, the vessels alter their mode of action, sd as to secrete pus. This change happens gradually. Hence* pus and coagu- lating lymph are often found blended together in the same abscess. The fact, that pus may be formed without a breach of the solids, or dissolution of parts, was first noticed by Dr. Hunter, in 1749, or 50, in the dissection of a subject who died of empyema. M. Quesnay has inserted, in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Surgery, a case which fell under the observation of M. Peyronie, in â€¢which a very copious suppuration of the brain took place. The patient died, and the head was examined. The proportion of brain wanting was so trivial, com- pared with the quantity of pus that had been pro- duced, that Peyronie justly concluded, the matter had not been formed from the solids, but from the fluids of the part. The modern doctrine of suppuration is, that the pus is separated from the blood by the inexplicable operation of the secerning arteries, just as ordinary secretion takes place, and that the peculiar mode of action in the arteries, is the reason, why pus should be separated form the circulation, rather than coagulating lymph, mucus, &c. &c. It is further believed, that the solids never suffer any dissolution, so as to enter into the composition of pus, and that the deficiency, frequently apparent in them, arises from absorption. The arteries, in producing pus, a fluid so dissimilar from blood, and of which, at least, it must be considered as a new combination, seem to assume all. the power of glandular secretion.

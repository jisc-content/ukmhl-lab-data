PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 5 termed the huffy coat, or inflammatory crust. This con* sists of a stratum of coagulating lymph, almost destitute of red globules. The buffy coat is a greater criterion o the existence of inflammation, than even the state of the pulse itself. It is to be remembered, however, that there are a few anomalous constitutions, in which this appear- ance is always found. The blood taken from pregnant women has also the inflammatory oust. TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. Removal of the Cause. From the foregoing account of inflammation, it is obvi- ously the primary indication to lessen that immoderate action of the arteries, to which the symptoms and effects are attributable. Whatsoever forms the remote cause, ought manifestly to be removed. If the irritation of a splinter should excite phlegmonous inflammation, who would not of his owm accord extract the extraneous sub- stance ? But, the removal of the stimulus, exciting the process, will not put an immediate stop to it; for, the living solids seem to be endued with a sort of re-action. Hence, besides taking away (if possible) the occasional cause, it is proper to moderate by other means the increased vascular action. BLEEDING. We have noticed, that one principal effect of the in- creased action, is the transmission of a larger quantity of blood through the inflamed part. The propriety of endea- vouring to diminish the flux of blood to the part in most cases, cannot therefore be doubted. The chief mode of accomplishing this object is by general, and topical bleed- ing. General bleeding is not so universally requisite as topical. Inflammation is a local affection, and must, therefore, particularly demand local curative means. But, when inflammation is situated in a part of such great

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 535 soft pad, and an eighteen-tailed bandage, is to be laid un- der the thigh, from the great trochanter to the outer con- dyle. The surgeon, before applying the soap plaster, and oilier splints, is to take care, that the fracture lies as evenly as possible. FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. This bone is most frequently broken in a transverse direc- tion. The accident may happen in two ways, viz. in con- sequence of the action of external bodies, or of the exten- sor muscles. Jn the latter instance, the equilibrium of ihe body, having been inclined backward, the muscles in front contract to bring the line of gravity forward again ; the extensors of the leg, among other powers, exert themselves with such violence on the patella, that they pull the upper from the lower portion of this bone, and the patient falls down. Thus the fall is the consequence, not the cause, of the accident. The patella has been known to be fractured by making a very forcible kick : the olecranon, by merely throwing a stone. Longitudinal fractures of the patella are not very ob- vious : but transverse ones are easily recognized, in conse- quence of the upper portion of the bone being drawn a con- siderable way up the thigh, and there being a consider- able space, between the two pieces of the broken bone, very distinguishable by the touch. If the limb be extended, and the upper part of the patella be pushed sufficiently downward to touch the lower portion, a crepitus is felt. The patient cannot walk, suffers great pain, and expe- riences, in most cases, a total inability to extend the leg. However, the last circumstance must differ, according to the situation of the fracture, TREATMENT. The separation of the two pieces of a broken patella arises both from the contraction of the extensor muscles,

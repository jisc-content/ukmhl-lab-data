FIRST LINES CF THE 3S4 which is nearest to the symphysis of the pubis, and an in- cision shonld be made directly upward (according to Mr. Hey) for the purpose of cutting that part of the ring which this gentleman names the femoral ligament. Cim- bernat recommends introducing a director into the ring, with its back towards the intestine and its groove towards the symphysis pubis. Along the groove a narrow, probe- pointed bistoury is to be introduced into the ring, to divide the internal edge of the femoral ligament closely to the pubis. UMBILICAL HERNIA, OR EXOMPHALOS. The viscera protrude either through the navel or through 0 tD an opening in its. vicinity, produced by a breach in the fibres forming the linea alba. Ihe umbilical hernia is more common in children than adults, doubtless, because the navel becomes less capable of dilatation, in proportion to the length of time after birth. Women who are pregnant, or who have borne many chil- dren, and all subjects who are exceedingly fat, or afflicted with dropsy, are particularly liable to the umbilical hernia. Owing to the gradual manner, in which the disease usually originates, and to the largeness of the opening, through which the viscera protrude, the exomphalos is very seldom attended with strangulation. Hence, it is of the highest importance to be aware, that though patients having this kind of rupture, are very often affected with symptoms of disorder of the stomach and bowels, the indisposition, in most instances, does not proceed from the existence of strangulation. When practicable, this rupture should be reduced and supported by a truss, and in young subjects a radical cure Sometimes follows the continued use of this instrument. The best truss for umbilical hernia is described by Mr. Hey. It consists of two pieces of thin elastic steel, which

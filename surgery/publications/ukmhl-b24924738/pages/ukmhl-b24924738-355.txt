PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 313 their extraction would be very desirable. The foreign body is mostly situated above in the pharynx. Hence it is an important rule always to press down the tongue, and examine the back of the throat, before doing any thing else. Thus substances may frequently be discovered, and extracted with the fingers, or forceps, when from the patient’s account one would conjecture, that they had de- scended much further. Substances, which lodge in consequence of their size, cannot easily be extracted, because they fill the whole dia- meter of the oesophagus, and prevent the introduction of any instrument. Though in the majority of cases it is far better to extract, than push down extraneous substances, of what kind soever they may be; yet it is commonly much more difficult, and the surgeon is often necessitated to follow the latter method. When a foreign body is situated about the upper orifice of the oesophagus, it may very often be felt by the surgeon’s finger, and, if incapable of being removed in this manner, it may commonly be extracted by means of a pair of curved forceps. One of the most common instruments for extracting things from the oesophagus, is a kind of hook. This is best constructed of strong flexible wire, doubled, and twisted to- gether, in such a manner, that the bent end forms a noose, of the shape of a hook. * ^ Very small bodies, such as needles, fish-bones, &c. arc generally more easily extracted with a piece of sponge introduced beyond them. The art of employing compress- ed sponge, in the most advantageous manner, consists in taking a piece about the size of a chesnut, and introducing each end ofa strong ligature through it. The ends of the ligature are then to be passed through a tubc,+ anrl fasten- ed to that end of the instrument which the surgeon holds. • Plate 7, fig. f Plate 7, fig. 3.

}0 FIRST LINES OF TIIE Bating m fevers generally proceeds to suppuration, and ought to be treated on the emollient plan. The best emollient poultice is that made oflinseed meal. It is made by gradually mixing the powder with hot water until the consistence is such as it ought to be. A little oil is often added, which prevents the application from dry- ing and becoming hard. A very good emollient fomentation is that used at St. Bartholomew’s hospital : ft lini contusi^j. chamcemeli £ij. aqure distil, fevj. paulisper coque et cola. When the pain is exceedingly severe, the following fomentation, in use at Guy’s hospital, often produces great relief: ft pa- paveris albi exsiccati|iv. aqua: pura ibvj. coque usque re- jnanearrt ifeij. et cola. terminations of inflammation. Inflammation has three different terminations; or, to speak more correctly, after this process has continued a certain time, it either subsides entirely, induces a disposi- tion in the vessels to form pus, or completely destroys the vitalifyof the part. Ulceration is also an eflect sometimes directly produced by phlegmonous inflammation; but it luore frequently does not commence till suppuration has rendered it neces- sary. FIRST. RESOLUTION. The most common way iu which inflammation ends con- sists in a gradual abatement of the pain, redness, swell- ing, throbbing, and heat of the part, without any for- mation of matter, or permanent injury of structure. This is termed resolution, and is the best manner in which in-, » flammation can possibly end. SECOND.—SUPPURATION. The next most frequent termination of phlegmon is in the production of pus, termed suppuration; a state, in

- 83 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. When, at the same time, it fractures a bone, wounds a large artery, nerve, or important viscus, it is then called compound. OF CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCING- THE COURSE OF BALLS. The form, the momentum, and the direction of the shot that is received; the position, and the variety of struc- ture, or, in other words, the variety of density, and powers of resistance, in the part receiving it, are the grand agents directing the course of the ball, in its passage through the substance of the body. Every new resistance which a shot in motion meets with, operates so as to produce not only a diminution of its momentum, but also a change in its direction* By adverting to the above circumstances, the strange course which some balls lake, running nearly all round the body beneath the skin, is satisfactorily accounted for. QF GUNSHOT CONTUSIONS WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL BREACH OF CONTINUITY. It has been a prevailing idea, that a ball may injure parts of the body in two ways, viz. by actually striking them, and by passing close to them without touching them at all. This last injury has been supposed to origi- nate from the violent commotion produced in the air by the rapidity of the ball. It commonly consists of a consi- derable contusion, and even comminution, of the soft and hard parts situated beneath the skin, which remains itself entire. The above mode of explaining how this violence is oc- casioned is too absurd to need a serious refutation. The slight perturbation of the air is too feeble to account for the degree of violence committed. The air, to which the ball must impart the greatest motion, is* that which is di- rectly bdore it; and yet this does not the smallest degree of violence to the parts surrounding the spot where the g 2

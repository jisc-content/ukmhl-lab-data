The latter case is termed entropium. The causes of the distorted position of the cilia are, for the most part, cicatrices, and little indurations on the edges of the eyelids. A preceding inflammation, or ulceration, has caused the hairs to fall oft, and when they glow again, they shoot in a wrong direction.

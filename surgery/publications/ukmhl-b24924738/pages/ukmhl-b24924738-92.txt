6i) FIRST LINES OF THE the*iclvice to divide some wounded arteries completely through and through. This plan ought, however, seldom to be practised ; for if the artery be large, a ligature must, after all, be applied both above and below the wound ; and though it might answer when the vessel is of a mode- rate size, yet compression is far preferable. Were a large artery to be cut through and through, before applying ligatures to it, the shrinking of the vessel beneath the cir- cumjacent parts would only increase the difficulty in tying it afterwards. Sympathetic inflammatory fever is the consequence of all considerable wounds. By this the action of the whole arterial system is rendered more vehement. Hence, during its predominance, the patient is particularly exposed to the danger of fresh hemorrhage. The bleeding, occasioned by the impetuous motion of the blood, arises either from vessels which previously effused little or no blood, or from such as did bleed before, but were not effectually secured. In this case, if the patient be very plethoric, the per- formance of venesection is proper, the loss of venous blood being less prejudicial to the constitution than that of arte- rial. The flow of blood into the wounded limb is always to be decreased by placing the part (if possible) in an ele- vated posture. Sometimes cold applications, in other instances compression, may be advantageously tried. A tourniquet, applied so as neither to stop the circulation in too great a degree, nor hinder the ret urn of blood through the veins, would be exceedingly usefuj. If the hemorr- hage should still continue, the vessels must be exposed, and tied. Hemorrhages from external injuries seldom require in- ternal means. Were these needed, their virtue is very questionable.

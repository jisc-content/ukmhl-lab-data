No reasoning ot this kind however can satisfy a philosophical, much less a sceptical mind. We see violent nervous, spasmodic, tetanic affections, take place without any matter, blood, See. being confined by ligamentous, or tendinous expansions; we see the same complaints sometimes take place in extensive muscular w ounds, though not so often as in narrow tendinous ones ; and, lastly, as the most dreadful wounds are sometimes exempt from such constitutional symptoms, it is obvious tiiat all efforts to explain the cause by the nature ot the in- jury must prove unavailing. Some further remarks, relative to this subject, will be found in a future chapter, on the bad symptoms occa- sionally originating from the wound made in venesection. From the following account of tetanic disorders, it will appear probable, that in some cases tlie nervous system, and maleriaxitce, are first disturbed by the local complaint, and that this disturbance exists, and increases afterwards independently of the local in jury ; perhaps, in consequence of some peculiarity of the constitution, or what amounts to the same thing, the particular condition in which that constitution exists.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY." 553 of the os femoris is so high towards the outer condyle, that the latter case is very uncommon. * ' - The reduction is a thing most easily accomplished, as-, soon as the extensor muscles, and ligament of the patella, have been relaxed by a proper position. * ■ *' * ’ DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. The upper head of the tibia can hjirdly be completely luxated, without a laceration of the soft parts, and inte- guments, in such a degree, that the limb could not well be preserved. The leg is sometimes twisted outward, and this may happen without any rupture of the crucial liga- ments, the internal lateral ligament being the only one broken. On the other hand, when the bones of the leg are twisted inward, the crucial ligaments, and external la- teral ligament, must inevitably be ruptured. These cases are, for the most part, very easy of reduc- tion. The joint should afterwards be kept perfectly quiet for several weeks. However, many practitioners would be advocates for gently moving the joint occasionally, in order to prevent the formation of adhesions within the capsular ligament. DISLOCATION OF THE ANKLE. I have already noticed, in the chapter ofl particular fractures, the dislocation of the foot outward, in which case, the whole weight of the body being transmitted to the slender fibula, this bone is at the same time most com- monly fractured. The occurrence is attended with a rup- ture of the internal lateral ligament. Mr. Pott has taken particular notice of this accident in his remarks on frac- tures. The foot may sometimes be luxated inward, and the external lateral ligament broken. Occasionally, the foot is thrown forward, so that the narrow part of the as- tragalus becomes situated before the space between the two

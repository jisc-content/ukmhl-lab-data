first lines of the 148 l.ir muscle, are the utmost inconveniences commonly re- sulting from this disease; but when the tumour ulcerates, a very foul, and even dangerous, ulcer may be the result. TREATMENT. The common plan ot treating ganglions is to apply •pressure, or stimulating applications, to them, with a view of causing them to be absorbed. Binding a piece of lead on a ganglion with a roller is a very good meth- d. The oleum origani, or hartshorn, may be used as a lini- ment, when the stimulating plan is preferred. No doubt, when ganglions are only attached to the subjacent parts by a slender pedicle, they might be as safely cut out as encysted tumours, if care were taken to leave no part ot the sac behind. The disease, however, is not se- vere enough to induce the generality of patients to submit to an operation, particularly as the t umours may be always greatly diminished, or even quite dispersed, by the pre- ceding measures. CHAP. XXIX. ANEURISMS. • WHEN any part of an artery is preternaturally di-. latcd, the tumour is named a true aneurism. In such cases the artery is either only enlarged at a small part of its track, and the tumour has a determinate bor- der ; or the vessel becomes dilated for a considerable length, in which circumstance the swelling is oblong, and loses itself so gradually in the surrounding parts, that its margin cannot be exactly ascertained. The first case, which is the most common, is denominated the circum- scribed true aneurism; the second is named the diffused true aneurism.

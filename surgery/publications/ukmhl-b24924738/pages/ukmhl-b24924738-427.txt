PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 38* surround the sides of the abdomen, and nearly meet be- hind . At their anterior extremity they form conjointly an oval ring, to one side of which is fastened a steel spring. At the end of this spring is placed the pad, or bol- ster, which is to press upon the hernia. By the elasticity. of the spring the parts disposed to protrude are retained within the abdomen in every position of the body. A piece of calico is fastened to each side of the oval ring, having a continued loop at its edge. Through this loop a piece of tape is to be drawn, and fastened round the pa- tientâ€™s body, so as to preserve the instrument in its pro- per situation.* I shall not introduce an account of the radical cure of the exomphalos by a ligature ; the plan may now be con- sidered as completely exploded. The only modern ap- proved method of trying to accomplish a perfect cure is compression, and no bandage can execute this so well as the truss abovementioned. When an operation is unavoidable, and the hernia is large and of long standing, the whole sac should not b<j opened. An incision, about three inches in length, made through the integuments covering the upper part of the tumour, would be quite sufficient to enable the operator either to open and dilate the mouth of the sac directly up- ward, or merely to divide the linea alba immediately above the tumour in the same direction. However cases may occur, in which the strangulation may arise from the pressure produced on the intestine by the thickened omentum in the sac, and in which it would be necessary to expose freely the contents of the tumour, and to remove the diseased omentum. The only instance in which I have seen an operation performed was of this kind ; and no dilatation of the aperture, through which the parts had protruded, was requisite. * Plate VIII. fig. 1. c c

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. ' 49 and a (rain of other circumstances, which will be here- after explained. From this preliminary matter, I proceed to describe the chirurgical measures to be adopted in INCISED WOUNDS. In which cases, there is frequently nothing else to be remedied, but the simple breach of continuity, the cut fibres not having been stretched, contused or lacerated. When no artery of importance is divided, and no extra- neous bodies are lodged in the wound, the duty of the surgeon consists in promoting the reunion of the divided surfaces without delay. It often happens, however, that considerable vessels are injured, and then the bleeding demands primary at- tention. CHAP. XIII. % % . , ,i, * MEANS OF STOPPING HEMORRHAGE. WHEN an artery is wounded, the blood is of a bright scarlet colour, and gushes from the vessel per saltum, and with great rapidity. The blood issues from a vein in an even, unbroken stream, and is of a dark purple red colour. It must be plain to every one, who understands the course of the circulation, that pressure, made on that portion of a wounded artery, which adjoins the wound to- wards the heart, must check the effusion of blood. The current of blood in the veins, running in the opposite direction, requires the pressure to be applied to that side ot the wound, which is most remote from the heart. As pressure is the most rational means of impeding he- morrhage, so it is the most effectual, and almost all the E

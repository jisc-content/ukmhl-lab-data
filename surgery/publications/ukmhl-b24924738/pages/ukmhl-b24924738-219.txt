It is impossible, in a work of this sort, to treat of the whole of this extensive subject. Phymosis, paraph .mo- sis, gonorrhoea, hernia humoralis, &c. will be explained in the second part of the publication. CHAP. XXXVI. WHITE SWELLINGS, AND OTHER AFFEC- TIONS OF THE JOINTS.

In the first stages of the disease the skin is not at all altered in colour. The swelling sometimes yields in a certain degree to pressure, but is generally sufficiently firm to make the uninformed examiner believe, that the bones contribute to the tumour. Whatever degree of pain may attend the early stage of the disorder, it particu- larly affects only one point of the articulation, in general its centre, or the head of the tibia.

THIS term is applied to the little, preternatural, red- dish, akh-coloured, triangular membrane, usually growing from the internal angle of the eye, about the caruncula la- cfiryhwlis, and extending over the cornea to the great im- pairment of vision. Although ihis kind of membrane ge- nerally proceeds from the inner cantlius, it occasionally arises from the outer one, and, in some instances, from the superiour and inferiour hemisphere of the eye itself. "Wheresoever it originates, it is a remarkable fact, that it is invariably of h triangular shape, the base of the triangle being towards the white of the eye, the apex towards the contccr, sometimes at a greater, sometimes at a lesser dis- tance, from the axis of sight. In a few uncommon cases, two* or three pterygia., of various sizes, arc met with in the same eye, arranged with different interspaces around die circumference of the organ. Sometimes their points meet, and coalesce on the centre of the cornea, so as to completely abolish the functions of the eye. Scarpa observes, with his usual accuracy, that between chronic varicose ophthalmy with relaxation of the con- junctiva, the superficial opacity, termed nebula, and the pterygium, the only difference is in the degree of the dis- * Plate V. fig. 2.

FIRST LINES OF THE 178 they do not suppurate, but continue stationary ; and, when they do suppurate, it is slowly, and often in more glands than one. The matter comes slowly to the skiu, unattend- ed with much pain, and the colour of the integuments is a dark purple. If the swelling is only in one gland, is very slow in its progress, ancl gives but little, or no pain, it is probably scrophulous. TREATMENT OF BUBOES. In attempting to disperse venereal buboes, it is a great object to make as much mercury as possible pass through the swelling, by rubbing tiie unguent hydrarg. on sur- faces, from which the absorbents tend to the local disease. The same plan is equally commendable when a bubo is in a suppurated state; for both in this and the preceding stage of a bubo, the medicine, thus applied, cannot pass, to the common circulation without going through the dis- eased parts, and it must promote the cure in its passage through them, while at the same time it prevents the mat- ter, which has already passed, and is still continuing to pass into the constitution, from acting there, so that the bubo is cured, and the constitution preserved. The thigh, leg, or part of the abdomen, on the same side as the bubo, are the proper places. Mercury, however, can only cure the specific quality of the inflammation. "W hen the common inflammation rises very high, bleeding, purging, and fomentations may be useful auxiliary means. If the bubo be conjoined with erysipelatous inflammation, bark is indicated; if with scrophulous, administer hem- lock, and apply poultices made witli sea-water. Buboes ought seldom to be opened. When it is thought proper to open them, the skin should be allowed to become as thin as possible, as the abscess will heal better in consequence of this rule being observed. The mercurial frictions are to be continued in the way above mentioned, but it is not al-

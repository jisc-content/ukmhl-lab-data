.FIRST LINES OF THE 252 In mild cases, the pain may be compared to a sense of heat m the part affected, or to a sensation, seeming to arise from the lodgment of sand, or dust, underneath the eye- ids. In more severe instances there is a violent, burning, spasmodic, darting pain in the eye. When the patient feels as if the orbit were too small for the eyeball; when ie experiences a darting pain in the eyebrow, sometimes shooting as far as the occiput; we may infer, that the oph- thalmy is ot a very vehement sort, and that there is danger of suppuration. file exposure of an inflamed eye to the light is produc- tive of considerable pain, attended with a copious dis- charge of tears; consequently patients affected with oph- thahny are generally observed with their eyes, more or less, closed. Ophfhalmy is sometimes attended with a diminution, or total loss of vision ; and this unpleasant event may depend on opacity of the cornea, a closure of the pupil, or a para- lytic state of the retina. Tumefaction, which accompanies inflammation in ge- neral, seems principally to affect, in these cases, the con- jnnetiva forming the white of the eye. In very violent ophthalmies, this membrane swells, in such a manner, that it- covers the whole cornea, protruding like a thick fold be- tween the eyelids, which cannot be shut. The whole eye- ball seems, on (his occasion, like a portion of red flesh. The cornea is also liable to become considerably thickened, so as to come into contact with the iris, and adhere to it, or to form an opaque prominence forward, termed staphy- loma. In ophthnlmy the eyelids are not unfrequently very much swollen. Acute inflammations of the eyes are usually accompanied with the common symptoms of inflammatory fever, the constitutional disturbance being proportioned to the vehemence of the local affection. In severe ophtlialmy, two di-.tinct stages are commonly ob-

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 273 Some recommend the projection of the iris to he cut off with a stroke of thescissars, but this method is deemed less successful) than the plan already explained. The shape of the pupil always remains somewhat oval; however, this is productive of very trivial impairment of sight, and in time the opening in the iris becomes much wider, than it is immediately after the cure. 3. CLOSURE OF THE PUPIL. When this occurs, it is most frequently the consequence of a violent inflammation of the internal membranes of the eye, especially the iris, inconsequence of an operation. In particular instances the malady follows extraction and de- pression of the cataract, but without an inflammatory af- fection of the interior of the eye appearing to have any share in its origin. After an indeterminate time from the operation, the pupil is perceived to diminish in diameter daily, without any evident cause, and ordinarily closes so much, that it can hardly admit a pinâ€™s head. The iris is motionless, and assumes a radiated rugose appearance. When no opacity exists behind this membrane, a little black speck is seen in its centre. W hen the retina is sound the patient may sometimes re- gain a considerable power of vision, by having an artificial pupil formed. Some surgeons prefer opening the cornea, and making a perpendicular division ot the iris by means of a pair of scissars. Cheseldcn was the first, who performed an opera- tion, with a view of diminishing the blindness produced by this malady ; he introduced a couching needle, having a sharp edge only on one side, through the sclerotica, about a line and a halt from the margin of the cornea. After perforating the iris, towards the external angle, and then pushing the point of the needle transversely through the anterior chamber, as far as the edge of the iris next the nose, he turned the edge of the instrument backward, and x

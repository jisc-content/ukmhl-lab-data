PRACTICE OF SURGERY. ill tumour, and the disease rather merits the appellation of a prolapsus of the Schneiderian membrane than of a poly- pus. The whole membranous lining of the nostrils be- comes occasionally thus relaxed and thickened, so as to ftnder these cavities quite impervious : a case partaking of the same nature as what has been named the polypus of the â€˜mucous membrane. Though such are the principal varieties of nasal polypi, tliere exist others, which, however, are less common, and important. Some are quite pale, soft, and brittle. - Some are hollow,-and resemble a membranous pouch, containing a fluid, or matter of a slimy, pulpy, or even denser con- sistence. These bear a great similitude to encysted tu- mours, and are termed vesicular polypi. Some polypous tumours are quite smooth, some knotty, while others have long appendages attached to them. The fleshy polypus may grow at any part of the cavity of the nose; but it most frequently takes its origin from the ossa spongiosa. Sometimes the body of the tumour is situated in the nostril, while its root is firmly fixed in the ductus nasalis, the sinus frontalis, or the antrum maxillare. A polypus can naturally have only one root. But it oc- casionally happens that the tumour is adherent to several parts of the Schneiderian membrane, especially when the disease has acquired much magnitude, and the lateral pa- rietes of the nose are pressed and inflamed. The inexpe- rienced may mistake such adhesions for roots. The ex- crescence is originally always shaped like a pear ; but af- terwards it adapts its figure gradually to the form of the cavity in which it is situated. As long as this kind of polypus continues small, it occa- sions but little inconvenience. The patient usually sup- poses that he has caught a tedious cold ; for in damp weather the tumour swells, and obstructs the nose. In a dry atmosphere it shrinks, and then such complaints cease. This state, however, lasts only a short time. The

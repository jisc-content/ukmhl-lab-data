PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 101 a bandage operates beneficially in cases of varix, by obli- ging the blood to return through the deep-seated veins ; so that the superficial ones, not being distended with b oo become diminished in diameter. The pressure on the thick- ened vessels may also promote the diminution of them. In more obstinate cases, particularly when promse he- morrhages frequently take place from a varix, relief must be attempted by an operation ; which consists in dividing the skin over a superficial trunk of the diseased vein, and passing a ligature underneath the vessel, so as to be able to tie it firmly in the same manner as the arteries are tied. When the vena saphena is to be tied, as it passes oyer the knee-joint, the patient must stand on any thing ot a convenient height; the integuments are to be pinched up into a transverse fold, and divided ; and a silver bluntish needle will serve to convey a ligature under the vein, with- out risk of wounding it. hemorrhoids. As I am on the subject of varicose veins, I think it most convenient to notice here the complaint termed he- morrhoids or piles, by which is implied any considerable distension of the veins near the termination of the rectum. When the dilated veins do not bleed, the swellings ara called blind piles ; but when they do, they are denominated open piles. Sometimes they are external, at others internal. In general the inconvenience which they produce is very supportable; but when they bleed profusely, or are in- flamed, or strangulated by the sphincter ani, they gi\e rise in the first circumstance to weakness from loss of blood, and in the two latter cases, to very severe pain. Any tiling capable of retarding the return of blood through the hemorrhoidal veins may cause the disease. The pressure of the gravid uterus, the frequent retention of hardened fasces in the rectum, and a sedentary life, are fre- quently the occasion of piles, and hence women aic more

FIRST LINES OF THE 6 importance, that it cannot undergo a certain degree of disturbance, without endangering life itself, \vc must not be content with local measures alone. Thus when the brain is inflamed, the affection must be speedily subdued, or death will happen. Also, when the inflamed parts are endued wi(h infe- rior powers ol recovery, it is often necessary to have recourse to general, as well as topical bleeding ; as in in- flammation of a joint. ^Vhen inflammation is situated in an organ, Avhere suppuration would inevitably destroy its uses, it is also advisable to moderate the local affection, even at the expence of the whole system. Ophthalmy is a case of this kind. Breeding is quite improper, when the inflammation and fever are trivial; when the patient is very feeble, or aÂ°"ed * #nd when the cause of the affection can be entirely removed. The efficacy of bleeding is greater, the sooner it is prac- tised, and the more suddenly the blood is evacuated. Bleeding near the part affected is usually more effectual, than in a remote situation. Topical bleeding can only prove powerfully efficacious, when general plethora has been previously removed ; but, if no plethora, nor much fever should exist, it may have immense effect. purging. Mild purgatives of the saline kind, not only diminish the quantity of the circulating blood, by the increased secretion, which they .occasion in the alimentary canal, they also operate specifically in lowering all the operations of the system, and must therefore tend to subdue inflam- mation. As they have not so debilitating an effect as bleeding, they are seldom omitted, even when the evacu- ation of blood is judged dispensable. Natron vilriolatum, magnesia vitriolata, <!y soda phosphor at a, are the most proper. It most frequently happens, that the stomach and bowels of patients, who are affected with inflamma-

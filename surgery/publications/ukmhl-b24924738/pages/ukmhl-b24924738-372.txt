FIRST LINES OF THE 330 note that the air cannot get out of the cavity of the pleura so quickly as it finds its way into it; in which case a , smaIl> but direct, opening is to be made into that side of the chest on which the wound is situated. The practice of endeavouring to exhaust the air from the chest by syringes is now generally deemed superfluous, as it is soon absorbed; and the use and possibility of making the collapsed lung expand in this sudden way, are not credited by the best practitioners. The objection to immediately closing a wound practised to relieve the pres- sure of the air on the diaphragm and opposite lung is, that this pressure may possibly recur - but if the wound be keptnpen by a cannula, though one lung will collapse, the other will suffer no compression, and will support life till the wound in the opposite lung is healed-. Unfortunately the pressure on the lungs in these cases is Upt always simply owing to air: copious extravasations of blood not unfrequcntly exist at the same time. WOUNDS OF THE LUNGS, &C. When blood is coughed up immediately after the chest has been wounded, and when, at the same time, blood, blended with mucus and air, issues from the external open- ing, the lungs are certainly injured. Wounds of the lungs are attended with greatdanger; fatal hemorrhage, extravasation of blood into the large branches of tbe bronchia, and consequent suffocation ; co- pious effusions of blood into the cavity of the pleura ; vio- lent peripneumony, and suppuration in the chest; form a long list of very alarming consequences. When the wound takes place near the root of the lungs, it is commonly fatal, on account of the large size of the vessels at that part. Superficial wounds of the lower arul anterior portion of the lungs are frequently cured.

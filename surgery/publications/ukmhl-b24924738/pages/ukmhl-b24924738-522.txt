FIRST LINES OF THE 48(3 stone is no longer in the cavity of the bladder ; conse- quently, it can neither be felt by sounding, nor extracted by the operation of lithotomy. The rectum should be era tied by a clyster, before the time of operating ; the contents of the bladder, however, should not be evacuated, if this event can be hindered. _ i- A - J , 4 i LATERAL OPERATION. The patient is to be placed at the edge of a firm table, and the staff is to be introduced into the bladder. Then two garters, each about two yards long, are to be doubled, and placed, by means of a nno c, r ;und the patient ’s wrists. The patient is now to take hold of the outside of his feet with his hands, in such a manner, that the fingers are ap- plied to the soles. The two ends of the ligature are then to be carried round the ankle, next over the back of the hand, and under the foot. Then they are to be tied. In this manner, each hand and toot may be securely con- nected together. The staff, in fact, is only a director, with a groove for o’uidinff a cutting instrument into the bladder. It is shaped, 'like a sound, or catheter, in order to admit of being introduced through the urethra.' However, it is more curved and longer, than these instruments ; and its handle is rough, that the surgeon may hold it more firmly. There are two advantages in its being sufficiently curved : viz. its convexity is more plainly distinguishable in the .peri- neum ; and, on depressing the handle of the instrument, the groove, on the end of the convexity of the cuivature, can more readily be brought to run in the axis of the blad- der. The utility of the length of the instrument is very ob- vious \ as the operator is thereby less liable to think the staff in the bladder, when it is not so ; an i the beak of the gorget should still be in the groove, when introduced as far as necessary. An assistant is to hold the staff, making its convexitv

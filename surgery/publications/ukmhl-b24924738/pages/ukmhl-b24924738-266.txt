FIRST LINES OF THE 230 part of the duct, by passing a probe from tile fistulous aperture through it, and keeping it open by a seton, intro- duced m-this manner into the month. A degree of success has Certainly attended this method. It is obvious, however, that there is no occasion to re- establish the obliterated part of the duct; and it is not so easdy accomplished as making a new and more direct channel for the saliva into the mouth. This plan is also attended with greater success. The perforation is best made by.means of a very small trocar ; and the puncture should be made so close to the end of the fistula, as to be, as it were, a continuation of it. By following this mode the saliva more easily finds its way into the mouth. The wound is to be prevented from healing by a seton, which is to be worn a reasonable time. When the seton is removed, the next object is to heal the external fistulous opening. When small, applying the argentum nitratum. will make it heal; when large, at- tempts should be made to approximate its edges with sticking plaster. If the plan, just described, should not answer, it. is re- commended to introduce, with the trocar, a small carTula, â– which is to be left in the cheek, while attempts are made to heal tlie external opening, During the treatment of these cases, it is necessary to make the patient refrain, as much as possible, from masti- cating, or talking.

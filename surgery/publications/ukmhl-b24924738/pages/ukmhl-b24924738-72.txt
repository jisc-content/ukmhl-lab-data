42 FIRST LINES OF THE to affect the organs of respiration. Certain it is, that burnt patients often die with asthmatic symptoms. Whether we refer the tact to what I have first stated, or to an inex- plicable sympathy between the lungs and skin, is of no very material importance. treatment Of ISURXS. Before Mr. Kentish published his very excellent work on this subject, burns were almost always treated on the principle of subduing inflammation by. every kind of soothing means. Evacuations, emollient poultices, cool- ing saturnine lotions, and an inert liniment, composed of equal parts of lime water and olive oil, were tire remedies almost universally adopted. The good effects of powdered ice and snow on burns and scalds, had indeed been set forth by Sir James Earle, just before the method of dress- ing bums w'ith a liniment consisting of the ungucntijm re- sin® fkivae, and oleum terebinth in®, attracted public at- tention. t ' The injured surface, to which this application is to be made, is to Ire previously bathed with rectified spirit of wine, either simple or camphorated. The liniment is to be spread on old linen, and applied over the whole extent of the burn. The yellow ointment stops the pores of the cloth, impedes.evaporation, and thus confines the effect of the alcohol to the burnt surface. The first dressings arc to remain on four and twenty hours. Mr. Kentish thinks it of importance, that the in- jured surface should be left uncovered as little as possible. It is therefore recommended to have plasters ready spread before removing the old ones, and then only to take off oue piece at a time. It will seldom be necessary to repeat the application of alcohol a second time, or that of oleum terebinthin®. The inflammatory action will be found diminished, and, ac- cording to Mr. Kentish’s principles, the exciting means

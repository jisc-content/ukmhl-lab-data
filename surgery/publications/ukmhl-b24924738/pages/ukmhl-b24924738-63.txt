PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 33 another. Sometimes it disappears entirely at one place, and makes its attack on some other. As the disease gets well, the cuticle peels from the part. Erysipelas may be conjoined with phlegmon, in which case the inflammation is of a deeper red colour ; the swell- ing is greater and the pain more acute. There is a throb- bingin the part, and the pulse is full and hard. There is also a particular species of erysipelas (St. An- thonyâ€™s Fire) in which small vesicles arise, containing ail irritating fluid. These burst and scabs are formed, be- neath which suppuration-takes place. True erysipelatous inflammation seldom suppurates: it generally ends in resolution. Very violent cases some- times cause gangrene. In erysipelas there is no extravasation of coagulating lymph into the interstices of the part affected, consequent- ly adhesions are seldom formed, so that the expansion of the complaint is not limited, nor are any boundaries set to the matter, when abscesses unfortunately occur. Hence suppuration in these cases is a serious evil, and seldom happens without producing considerable sloughing of the fascia?, tendons, and cellular substance, beneath the skin. The latter part, being highly organized, frequently escapes, even when the sloughing of the other less vascular parts is very considerable. Erysipelas in the face, ccutcris paribus, is more danger- ous than in any other external situation. CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. In a mild attack of erysipelas no fever is perceptible during the disorder ; but the pulse is generally a li'tle ac- celerated before its commencement. In a more severe attack an unusual languor, heaviness in the limbs, head-ache, loss of appetite, nausea, actual vomiting, and oppressions about Ihe stomach, precede the appearance of tbe local complaint.

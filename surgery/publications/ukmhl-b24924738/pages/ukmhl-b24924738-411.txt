The doctrine, tlwt eating a good deal of oil is conducive to ruptures, seems only to deserve a place among the nu- merous hypotheses* with which the human judgment is in- cessantly blinded. TREATMENT OF A STRANGULATED HERNIA, BEFORE HAVING RECOURSE TO AN OPERATION. There is no truth, in the whole body of surgical know- ledge, more confirmed by experience, than what is contain- ed in the following passage of Mr. Pott’s treatise on rup- tures: “ A hernia, with painful stricture and stoppage of stools, is one of those cases in which we can seldom stand ‘still even fora short space of time; if ive do not get “ forward, we generally go backward ; and whatever does “ no good, if it be at all depended upon, certainly does “ harm, by occasioning an irretrievable loss of time.” When we reflect upon what parts are wounded by the ope- rator; when We view the operation in an abstract light, and put out of consideration the whole of that constitu- tional derangement, which invariably results from the con- tinuance of the strangulation; there seems ample cause to believe, that the generality of fatal events, consequent to the operation, are attributable to the disease itself, and not to the attempt madefor its relief.

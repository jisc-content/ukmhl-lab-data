FIRST LINES £F THE 5o4 equally well, at the interspace, between the margins of the pectoral, and deltoid muscles, below this bone. The great particularity, in operating very high, is raising the deltoid muscle, alter first making an incision corresponding to its margin in shape and situation. Then the muscle is to be detached from the bone beneath, so as to form a flap, which is to be turned up. The operation is then to be finished in the ordinary manner.- » 1 ... amputation of tiie forearm. The forearm is to be amputated as low as the case will allow. The tourniquet is to be applied, a little above the condyles of the humerus, with its pad on the brachial ar- tery, at the inner edge of the biceps muscle. While one assistant holds the hand, another is to take hold of the forearm, above the place where the first circular wound is to be made. Thus, in conjunction with the person, who lias charge of the hand, he will fix the limb in a proper manner, and, at the same time, can draw up the integu- ments. The skin is to be detached from the fascia, a little Way upward, when the amputating knife has been carried round the limb. The muscles are then to be divided with the common knife, as long as this will do what is to be done with convenience, and the catling is afterwards to be employed for completing the division of the soft parts, si- tuated between the radius and ulna. The retractor is to be ' ( ' • applied, and the bones sawn, with the hand in the state of pronation. There are, in general, only four arteries to be tied, viz. the radial, ulnar, and two interosseous ones. AMPUTATION AT TIIE SHOULDER JOINT.

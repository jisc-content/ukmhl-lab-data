114 FIRST LINES OF THE gives way at its root, even although the anteriour part is taken hold of; but in other cases ihe polypus breaks where it is grasped, a portion being left behind, and a profuse hemorrhage ensuing. The latter event is void of danger, when the surgeon immediately introduces the forceps a&ainjgrasps the remaining piece, and extracts it. This is the most infallible method of diminishing the hemorrhage. In this way a large polypus is frequently extracted piece- meal, without any serious loss of blood. After the polypus has been propelled as far forward into the nostril as it can be, by blowing strongly through the nose, its anteriour part is to be taken hold of by a small pair of common forceps, held in the left hand, and is to be drawn gradually and slowly out, in order to make room for the introduction of the polypus forceps. The more slowly we proceed, the more the polypus is elongated, the narrower it becomes', the greater is the space in the nostril for the introduction of the polypus forceps, and the higher can this instrument grasp the tumour. After it has grasp- ed the polypus as high as possible, it is to be twisted slowly round, and at the same time pulled outward till the tumour breaks. It is a very important rule rather to twist than pull the instrument, and thus rather to writhe the tumour off than drag it out. The longer and more slowly the po- lypus forceps are twisted, the more the place where the ex- crescence separates is bruised, the less is the danger of he- morrhage, and the more certainly does the tumour break at its thinnest part. When the polypus has given way, an examination should be made whether any portion remains behind. When the polypus is very narrow at the place where it has hroken, and when the patient can breathe freely through the nose, there is reason to presume that the polypus has given way at its root. -The finger, however, or the probe, when this cannot be introduced, obtains the most certain Information.

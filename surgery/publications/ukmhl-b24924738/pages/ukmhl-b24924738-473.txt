PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 431 the bougie; for if this recoil, it has not passed, but only bent. However, a very small bougie might be bent, and yet not recoil. After the bougie has passed a little way through the stricture, and remained there a short lime, we should with- draw, and examine its extremity. If this be flattened, grooved, or should have its waxen coat pushed up for some extent, or if there should be a circular impression on the bougie, or only a dent on one side, made by the spasmodic ac ion of the stricture, we may be sure that it has passed, as far as those appearances and impressions extend. Now it becomes necessary to introduce another exactly of the same size, and let it remain as long as the patient experiences no particular inconvenience. When the end of the first bougie is blunted, we may be sure that it has not passed the stricture at all. The best time for wearing bougies, is when the patient is in bed in the morning, or when he is not obliged to move about. The bougie should be gradually increased in size, as the stricture dilates, till the largest, one can easily pass, and its use should be continued for three or four weeks af- terwards, in order to habituate the parts to their new state. One advantage, which common bougies have over caustic ones, consists in their being calculated, when in- troduced into the bladder, to operate on several strictures at once. METHOD OF USING CAUSTIC BOUGIES. The idea of applying caustic to strictures, through a cannula, was known to Wiseman. It appears, that Mr. Hunter, without having been aware, that the method had been noticed by the above writer, adopted the same plan in his own practice. The instruments, which he employed for applying the caustic, consisted of a silver cannula, and a stilet. One end of the stilet liad a small bulb.

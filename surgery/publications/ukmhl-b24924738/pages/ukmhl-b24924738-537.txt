495 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. * CHAP. LXI. AMPUTATION. AMPUTATION OP THE THIGH. TIIU thigh should be amputated as low as the disease will allow. The patient is to be placed on a firm table, with his back properly supported by pillows, and assist- ants, who are also to hold his hands, and keep him from moving too much during the operation. The ankle of the sound limb is to be fastened, by means of a garter, to the nearest leg of the table. The first thing is the application of the tourniquet. The pad of this instrument should be placed exactly over the femoral artery, in as high a situation, as can convenien'ly be done. When the thigh is to lie amputated very far up, it is better to let an assistant compress the femoral ar- tery in the groin by any commodious instrument, having a round, blunt end, adapted for making direct pressure on he vessel, without injuring the integuments. That the operator may not have the other thigh between himself and the one which he is about to amputate, he ought to stand on the outside of the limb to be removed. An assistant, firmly grasping the thigh with both hands, is to draw upward the skin and muscles, while the surgeon makes a circular incision, as quickly as possible, through the integuments, down to the muscles. The cellular sub- stance, connecting the skin, immediately above this wound, w ith the fascia is next to be divided all round tiie limb, till as much skin can be drawn back, as will afterwards, con- jointly with the muscles, cut in a mode about to lie de- scribed, cover the surface of the wouud with the utmost facility. >

FIRST-LINES OF THE 3G0 (> rehe swelling occurs, on account of their very deep situation, and the-difficulty of knowing witli certainty their existence. Hut as soon as a swelling and fluctuation have become evident, the sooner the matter is discharged the better. Experience shews, that when a psoas abscess is opened in the common manner death in general follows sooner, than if the swelling were allowed to burst of itself. The formation of a large opening, but particularly the aper- ture being afterwards left unclosed, occasions an inflamma- tory affection of the whole cyst of ihe abscess, and the most violent description of constitutional disturbance. The discharge is profuse, and its quality becomes thin and fetid. The patient’s pulse becomes small, rapid,'and ir- regular ; copious perspirations, and uunemitting diarrhoea; even delirium ensue, and death very commonly closes the scene. I have had so many opportunities of appreciating the practice recommended by Mr. Abernethy in these cases, that 1 must consider it, in the present state of surgery, as the only one warrantable. This gentleman’s method is to open-the tumour with a broad abscess lancet, observing to introduce the instrument somewhat obliquely. This wound is .generally sufficient for the. discharge of coagula, which are very commonly blended with the contentsof lumbar abscesses. The abscess being completely emptied, the lips of the orifice are to be brought together by means of lint and sticking plaster, in the same way as after phlebotomy, and a compress and bandage are then to be applied. The wound generally heals without trouble. The matter of course collects again, and regularly as it is secreted descends to the lower part of the cyst, on which account the upper part of the cavity will remain a good while undistended, and have an opportunity of contract- ing, When the integuments are ngaih sufficiently ele-

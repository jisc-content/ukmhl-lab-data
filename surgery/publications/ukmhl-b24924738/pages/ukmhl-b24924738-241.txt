207 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. puration lias been the consequence ; here, probably, a con- siderable degree of sympathetic fever takes place, and very great powers of constitution will be necessary to bear the irritation and copious discharge that is likely to come from the wound for a great length of time. Sometimes, in this state, the constitution impaired and weakened by the local disease, is attacked by hectic symptoms; fresh irritation happens in the fracture ; large suppurations take place undeu the fascia, which require puncturing, and the patient is thus brought to the lowest condition, which must soon inevitably conclude, if it is not in the power of sur- gery to make a prompt attempt to alter the nature of the case. At other times, the patient’s constitution holding out, the suppuration in 'the wound is soon accompanied with the formation of granulations, and cicatrization fol- lows. We will consider a third case, where the violence done to the limb has been more severe, so as to be followed by a speedy mortification of the w hole extremity, and death of the patient. Here, perhaps, had the limb been sacrificed, and amputation been performed immediately after the re- ceipt of the accident, the patient’s life might have been preserved. But no sooner have the symptoms of gan- grene made their awful appearance, than experience for- bids the recourse even to amputation, and the patient is, as it were, out of the reach of surgical aid. Hence arises the absolute necessity of determining primu facie, the pro- priety, or impropriety, of attempting to preserve a limb which has met with a compound fracture. When the appearance of inflammation takes -place (which quickly happens), when there are violent throbbing and pain in the whole limb, the operation is too late, and it w ould only be adding an increase to the patient’s suffering to attempt it, as gangrene of the stump would be inevitable. There are then two grand moments always to be observed, and

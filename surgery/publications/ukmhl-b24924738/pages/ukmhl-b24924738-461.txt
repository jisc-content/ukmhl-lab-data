419 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. vsot (o interrupt the exhibition of mercury, when chancres are known to exist. When the patient is not taking the latter medicine, he should not neglect to keep his bowels well open. When a phymosis is occasioned by the lodg- ment of acrid, sebaceous matter, beneath the prepuce, no- thing produces relief, more expeditiously, than uncovering the corona glandis, if possible, and washing the part with soap and water. Then the employment of the saturnine lotion, both as an injection, and a lotion, for keeping the inflamed part cool, will very soon accomplish a cure. From the extensive sloughing, which I have frequently seen follow operations, performed on the prepuce, during its inflamed and oedematous state, in cases of phymosis, I have no hesitation in asserting, that such practice is very injudicious, and hurtful. No inflamed phymosis can ever require the employmentof the knife, if we except the parti- cular instance, in which the matter accumulates under the prepuce, and cannot make its exit, but by an ulcerative process. The application of dressings to sores is never a sufficient reason ; for these may be washed with an injec- tion, and, when kept clean, they w ill heal, as soon as a due quantity of mercury has been exhibited. When matter is completely confined beneath the pre- puce, behind the glans, a puncture may be made into the collection of pus with a lancet, and, through this opening, proper washes may be injected. The ca-es, which require an operation, are such as are natural, and do not amend as the patient advances to the adult state; such as occur without acute inflammation, and, to all appearances, spontaneously; and others, w hich arise from the puckering of the prepuce, in conse- quence of former ulcerations. OPEIIATIOX FOR THE PHYMOSIS. lintil very lately, surgeons used to slit open the prepuce with a curved bistoury, a little on one side of the centre of f. e 2 Â»

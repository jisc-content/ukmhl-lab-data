Though we daily see myriads of persons afflicted with various forms of scrophulous disease, we know little more than its symptoms, and remain almost in utter ignorance in regard to its causes and cure. The fungus haematodes, cancer,and lues venerea, are cer- tainly hoirid afflictions ; but perhaps they are preferable to scrophula; for we can sometimes totally extirpate the two former maladies by an operation, and we possess a specific for the venereal disease, while no operation can era- dicate scrophula from the system, and though a few medi- cines seem to palliate, not one is efficacious enough to put a certain stop to strumous disorders. Scrophula is more terrible by being an hereditary disease, and th(j peculiar constitution, in which the strumous ten- dency dwells, is very often denoted by particular appear- ances.

350 FIRST LINES OF THE actual occurrence; but it is highly probable, that in many of these cases the bowels have been punctured, and an ex- travasation ot the intestinal matter has been impeded by the Apposite pressure of the adjacent viscera. Â«It is further probable, that such resistance and pressure have sometimes occasioned intestinal matter, actually ex- trayasated^ to repass into the wound of the bowel, and thus to be speedily removed. Such copious evacuations of blood per anum have followed stabs of the abdomen, as could hardly proceed from the arteries of the intestines. This mode of an extravasation being got rid of, must however be rare, compared with that by absorption, But the adhesive inflammation is a principal circum- stance preventing the wide diffusion of extravasated fluids among, the viscera.of the abdomen. All the surfaces, in contact with each other, and surrounding the track of the wound, become generally so intimately connected together by the adhesive inflammation, that the wound forms a sort of canal, entirely destitute of all communication with the cavity of the peritoneum. The rapidity, with which such adhesions take place, is often very great. When the extravasation takes place to a certain degree at the moment of the wound, the effused fluid often be- comes, in a very short time, shut up in the cyst, in conse- quence of the adhesive inflammation having united all the surrounding surfaces to each other. Sometimes the extravasation is, however, diffused in va- rious degrees over the abdomen, owing to the patient being subjected to a great deal of motion, or to violent spasmodic contractions of the intestines, arising from the irritation of the extravasated matter. Urine and-bile are more fre- quently dispersed extensively among the convolutions of the viscera than blood. TREATMENT OF EXTRAVASATIONS. W hen an extravasation is perceived at first, a part of

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. . 5li again. In cases of herniae, it is ofien a great desideratum to make a free opening, in order that the sudden evacua- tion of blood may 'make the patient faint. The puncture being made, the patient is to support his arm, in a conve- nient position for allowing the blood to flow into a basin, by taking hold of a stick, which he may turn round and round in his hand, to put the muscles in action, and make the blood flow out in a fraer current. Sometimes, however, it escapes so readily, that there is no occasion to move the muscles of the arm. TV'hen the patient is so circum- stanced, that lie cannot take hold of a stick, the surgeon is to support the arm in a convenient posture; and, if the vein should not bleed in a free manner, he is to desire the patient to take hold of any small body, and move it about in his hand, in order to put the muscles of the forearm into action. 'fhe due quantity of blood having been taken away, the ligature is to be loosened, and removed. The current of blood now generally ceases, and always does so, when the surgeon places the thumb of his left band just below* the orifice. The arm in this state is to be washed with a sponge, and dried. The edges of the wound are to 11c placed in contact, and kept so by a small compress of lint, which is to be bound on the part, by applying the bleeding fillet round the arm, in the form of a figure of eight. The band- age is to meet and cross in front, exactly over the dossil of lint. When the external jugular vein is opened, the surgeon generally makes the necessary pressure with his thumb. The orifice should be made in the direction of the fibres of the platysma my aides muscle, and (lie vein is not so apt to glide out ol the way, when the surgeon opens the vessel, just where it lies over some part of the sterno-cleidd-jnas- toldens. The temporal artery, and its branches, are the only ves- sels in which surgeons perform artcriotomy. When the

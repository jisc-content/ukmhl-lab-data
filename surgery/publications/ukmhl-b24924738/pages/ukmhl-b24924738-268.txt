This is to be done on each side of the cleft, and the two incisions are to meet nt an angle above, thus in order that the whole track is wound may be brought together, and united by (ho first intention. . \'e hps/lre so very moveable, and it is so very de- grade in this case to heal the wound by adhesion, that a particular process is always pursued to keep the lips of the vound in contact. Two silver pins, made with steel points, are introduced through the edges of the wound; and a piece of thread is then repeatedly wound round the ends of the pins from one side of the division to the other, first transversely, then obliquely, from the right or left end of one pin above, to the end of the lower on the opposite side, &c. 1 hus the thread is made to cross as many points of the wound as possible, and greatly contributes to main- tain Fs edges in even apposition. It is obvious, that a great deal of exactness is requisite in introducing the pins, m order that the edges of the incision may afterwards be precisely applied to each other in the proper manner. The pins ought never to extend deeper than about two- thirds through the substance of the lip. It would be a gieat improvement always to have them constructed a little curved. This is what is named (he twisted suture. The pms may usually be removed in about four days, the sup- port of sticking plaster being afterwards quite sufficient,

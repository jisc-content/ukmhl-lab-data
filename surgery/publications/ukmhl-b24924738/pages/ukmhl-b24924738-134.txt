1&2 FIRST LINES OF THE on a particular state of tlic constitution. In the affection to rvhich I allude, the sanguiferous system is not princi- pally disturbed, as it is in the sympathetic inflammatory lever ; nor do the symptoms seem to bear any proportion to the quantity oflocal injury. ; The chief symptoms in question are, restlessness; vigi- lance; sudden dejection of the .spirits; unaccountable prostration of strength ; delirium ; spasms and convul- sions ; retention of urine ; vomiting ; cholicky pains; palpitations of the heart; coldness of the surface of the body ; oppression in the chest; difficulty of swallowing ; locked jaw ; tetanus, &c.

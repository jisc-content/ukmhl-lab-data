However, sometimes the passage of air into, and out of the chest, through the wound, leaves no doubt that the in- jury extends beyond the pleura eostalisâ€¢ But this syrupy tom can only be expected when there are no circumstances present rendering the wound tortuous, or not freely per- vious. The entrance and exit of air, through the wound, arise from the alternate enlargement and contraction of the tho- rax in respiration. It is well known, that, in the perfect state, the surface of the lungs always lies in close contact with the membrane lining the ribs, both in inspiration and expiration. The lungs themselves are only passive organs, and are quite incapable, by any action of their own, to ex- pand and contract, so as to maintain their external surface constantly in contact with the inside of the thorax, which is continually undergoing an alternate change of dimen- sions. Every muscle that has any concern in enlarging and diminishing the chest, must contribute to the effect of adapting the volume of the lungs to the cavity in which they are contained, while there is no communication be- tween the cavity of the pleura and the external air. In in- spiration, the thorax is enlarged in every direction, the lungs are expanded in the same way, and the air, entering through the windpipe into the air-cells of these organs, prevents the occurrence of a vacuum. But when there is a free communication between the at- mosphere and the inside of the chest, on this cavity being expanded, air must enter at the bag of the pleura, and the lung remain proportionally collapsed. There are several reasons why this event does not regularly take place in wounds of the chest; the principal one is, that the open- ing is seldom sufficiently ample and pervious, and is soon covered with dressings; another is the great frequency of

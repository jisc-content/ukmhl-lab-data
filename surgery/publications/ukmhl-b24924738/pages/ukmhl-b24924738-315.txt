PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 27/ conveniences, except an uneasy sensation of tumefaction and tension in the orbit, a difficulty of moving the eyeball, and a considerable impairment of sight. \V hen the eye has assumed an oval figure, and the anterior chamber has become preternaturally capacious, the iris seems situated backward in an unnatural degree, and tremulates in a very singular way, on the slightest motion of the eyeball. The pupil remains dilated in every degree of light, while the crystalline is sometimes discoloured from the very begin- ning of the disease, and sometimes does not become opaque, till the affection has arrived at its highest pilch. W hile the eye is not considerably enlarged, and the crystalline is not deeply opaque, the patient can usually distinguish the outlines of objects and brilliant colours. But when the eye has acquired a larger volume, and the whole crys- talline has become opaque, the retina becomes completely paralytic, probably, from the excessive distention which it suffers. In the last stage of the disease, when the dropsical eye projects from the orbit, so as not to admit of being covered by the eyelids, to the inconveniences already enumerated, others associate themselves, arising sfrom the dryness of the eye ; the contact of extraneous bodies ; the friction of the eyelashes ; the very viscid secretion from the eyelids ; the ulceration of the lower eyelid, and even of the eye it- self. He nee the advanced stage of dropsy of the eye in- duces violent ophthalmias, followed by ulceration and total destruction of the organ. TREATMENT. In tire incipient period of the disease, it is usual to pre- scribe mercurials, or cicuta internally, and to make a set on in ihe nape of the neck. Scarpa describes astringent appli- cations as hurtful, and recommends the eye to be bathed with a decoction of mallows.

455 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. I am of opinion, that no harm would ever result from withdrawing the cannula, after puncturing the bladder through the rectum. If the urethra should not be per- vious at the time, the frequent passage of urine through the wound would certainly be sufficient to beep it from clos.n^,, and the occasional passage of urine through the lower part of the rectum, would not be so irritating and troublesome, as the continual presence of the cannula. We read in the Medical Communications, xol. I., an ir,stance, in which the cannula was inadvertently withdrawn, forty-eight hours after the operation, and could not be introduced again. The urine was discharged into the rectum, through the wound, for six days afterwards ; and when it began to flow through the urethra, the wound healed without leaving any fistulous communication between the bladder and the rectum. Richter states, that the cannula has even been withdrawn immediately after the operation, without any inconveniences following the occurrence. However, it is not my'intention to advise the cannula to be withdrawn. This operation is not eligible, when the prostate gland is very much enlarged ; w hen there are large hemorrhoids present; or when the rectum is, what is term- ed, scirrho-contracted. To women it is obviously inapplicable, for anatomical reasons. In female patients, however, it is very practica- ble to puncture the bladder from the vagina. But, in these subjects, the urethra is so capacious and short, lhat the surgeon can hardly expect to be ever under the neces- sity of puncturing the bladder ; the catheter may almost always be introduced. Though the female bladder might, and, indeed, has been punctured from the vagina, I do not mean to recommend this method) for to me the operation above the pubis seems a better one.

PRACTICE'OF SURGERY. 429 Plate VIII, fig. 3. i uf the bougie, to enter one of the lacurue, or on passing it to rub upon its edge, yet by feeling whether the same rouga- ness or difficulty attends the withdrawing of the bulb the probe, or when it passed downward, we may be assur- ed f whether there be a stricture of the canal, or whether the obstruction be not caused merely by the lacuna. The author proceeds to observe, that, as the lacuna opens towards the urethra, its edge cannot catch the probe, while this instrument is being withdrawn, at which period a uniform smoothness must be felt, unless there be disease. When there is an irregular hardening of thÂ« urethra, for a considerable extent, the probe moves along it with difficulty ; but no sooner has it passed the ob- struction, than it moves on with freedom.* Certainly* these balls seem well calculated for ascertain- ing the degree and extent of strictures, and, if found in practice to be productive of as much utility, as they seem to promise on paper, I have no doubt, that the cases pro- per for the armed bougie may hereafter be generally dis- criminated from others, which would receive most benefit from the common one. It is obvious, that a caustic bougie is not at all proper for removing an obstruction of any extent. It could only act on the anterior part of the contraction, without pre- senting any prospect of being sufficiently efficacious to burn its way, by repeated applications, through the whole extent of the stricture. Even could wc imagine, that it had this power, our judgment and common sense would revolt at the doctrine of this being the proper plan to be pursued. The common bougie, on the other hand, is in- troduced through the whole extent of the stricture, and acting like a wedge on every part of it, produces a general dilatation of the obstruction. When the stricture is co- nical the common bougie must also merit a preference.

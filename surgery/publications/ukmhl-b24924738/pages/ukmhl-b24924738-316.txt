FI 11 ST LINES- OF THE G7S W hen the disease has attained such a pitch that the eye protrudes from the orbit, there is no means of opposing the â€¢grievous dangers now impending, except making an inci- bion in order to evacuate (lie superabundant fluid in the eye. To defer the operation any longer is the same thing as abandoning the patient to the inconvenience of an habi- tual ophthalmy, the danger of ulceration of the eyeball, and lower eyelid, and what is worse, of carcinoma of the whole eye. Simply puncturing the eye is no more ade- quate to produce a permanent cure of the dropsical affec* lion, than puncturing the tunica vaginalis is sufficient to produce a radical cure of the hydrocele. Inflammation and suppuration must be excited, besides discharging the redundant humours contained in the organ. The best method to pursue is that which has been re- commended for the cure of the inveterate staphyloma. A portion of the centre of the cornea, about as 'broad as a pea, is to be cut out, and so much of the humours are then to be pressed out as will permit the eyelids to be brought over the eye. Nothing but a pledget of dry lint, kept on by a bandage, is to be applied before the inflammation has laken place, which is usually about the third or fifth day. Then antiphlogistic means may be adopted, and emollients employed. Mr. Ford lias recommended the introduction of a seton through the eye in these cases, 3. CANCER OR THE EYE, Carcinoma is said to make its appearance in this situa* tion in three forms. Sometimes the eyeball becomes irre- gulir and knobby, and swells to the size of an apple ; the sight is gradually lost.; the blood-vessels in the white of the eye enlarge ; and the whole external and internal structure of the organ becomes so altered, that the part resembles a piece oi flesh, and no vestiges of its original organization

Internally may sometimes be discerned a small aperture, through which may be distinguished the remains of the vitreous humour, and of the choroid coa ^ In some instances the eyeball is ulcerated, and emits a fetid discharge. In others there is not the smallest appearance of ulceration, and the eyeball resembles a piece of firm flesh. The patient commonly experiences in the eve, from the first, considerable burning, and at last violent darting pains, extending over one side of the head. Hus is 1 ie most frequent description of cancer of the eye. Sometimes excrescences form on the anterior surface of ihe eye, especially on the transparent cornea, and frequent- ly admit of being radically cured by the knife, caustics, or ligature. But occasionally, they regularly grow again after the employment ot these means, becoming broader, more malignant, and even cancerous, and at length chang- ing into a spongy fungus, which is very painful, covers the whole anterior surface of the eye, and renders extirpation indispensable. This is the second sort of cancer of the eye. On several occasions ulcers form on the tront of the eye- ball, which, though generally curable by proper means, sometimes arc exceedingly inveterate, entirely destroying the eyesight, and becoming so malignant as to obtain the appellation of cancer. This is the third species of cancer of this organ. 4. extirpation of the eye. . / When the eyeball is exceedingly enlarged, it is neces- sary to divide the eyelids at the external angle, in order to facilitate the operation. The surgeon can operate most conveniently when he employs a common dissecting kniie, and when his patient is lying down with his face exposed to g.good light. That operator must be endued with very

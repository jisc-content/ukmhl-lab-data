t 352 FIRST LINES OF TflE Urine, bile, and intestinal matter, extravasated in the abdomen, occasion dangerous inflammation, and not un- frequently gangrenous mischief. No measure can lead to the patient’s preservation but a timely evacuation of such effusions. The antiphlogistic plan alone is quite ineffec- tual, and even the discharge of the extravasated fluid will not avail, unless speedily practised ; for after the inflam- mation has attained a certain pitch, gangrene becomes in- evitable. When the extravasation is situated near the external wound, the surgeon must endeavour to make a way for its escape, by gently separating the bowels from each other, and the peritoneum, by means of a probe, on his own fingers. The wound may even be enlarged to promote this object. When the extravasation is situated remotely from the external wound, an opening must be made into it by a trocar, or a scalpel, at a depending part. The trocar is the most eligible instrument in cases where the extrava- sation is thin and limpid, the swelling large, and the fluc- tuation distinct. When the extravasated matter is not very fluid, as for instance, excrement and coagulated blood; when the swelling is not very prominent, the undulation is not very plain ; it is safer and more effectual to employ a scalpel. WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES. Vomiting of blood, or dischargerof it by stool; the escape of fetid air, or of intestinal matter from the exter- nal wound; an emply, collapsed state of a portion of bowel protruded at the aperture ; arc the ordinary visible symptoms attending a wound of the intestine. When the wound happens to be situated in the protruded portion, it is then obvious to the surgeon’s eye ; but when the in- jury has occurred at a part of the intestinal canal, situated

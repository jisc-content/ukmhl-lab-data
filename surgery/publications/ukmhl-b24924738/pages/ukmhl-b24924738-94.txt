62 FIRST LINES OF THE the first intention. Its great recommendations are celerity of cure, freedom from the inconveniences of suppuration, and the prevention of an ugly cicatrix. In promoting union by the first intention, surgery is only to officiate as the handmaid of nature. There arc only two indications to be fulfilled : the first is to bring the edges of the wound into reciprocal contact; the other is to avert the access of immoderate inflammation, by which the agglutination of the wound would certainly be prevented. The first object-is accomplished by a proper position of the wounded part; by bandages; by adhesive plaster; and by sutures.

When the integuments alone are cut, the same posture, which relaxes the muscles, situated immediately beneath the wound, also serves in general to relax the skin. In transverse wounds of mus- cular fibres it is astonishing what immense effect the ob- servance of a proper posture produces. This is neverJtt be neglected, whatever may be the other means adopted. 2. UNITING, on INCARNATIVE BANDAGE. This is the name given to such bandages as sustain di- vided parts in exact contiguity. The common-u'hiting bandage can only be applied to wounds, which take a di- rection corresponding to the length of the body or limbs, and which are situated where a bandage can be used. It consists of a double-headed roller, having a slit between

*9? FIRST LINES OF THE stomach, obstinate constipations, purgings, involuntary discharge of urine, and faeces, &c. The paralytic affeclion of the legs is certainly owing to the particular statcin which the spinal marrow, surrounded by the diseased vertebrae, is placed. When the distemper has existed only a short time, the ligaments, connecting ths vertebrae, which form the curve, are somewhat thickened and relaxed, and the bodies of these bones affected with a change, similar to what I have described as taking plate in the heads of bones, in cases of white swellings. When the distemper has been of longer existence, the ligaments are more manifestly thickened, and the bones more obvi- ously altered, and even becoming carious. The quantity of elastic substance, between the bodies of the vertebra is much diminished, and, after death, in advanced eases, the bones are always found carious, while a quantity ofsanious fluid is lodged between them and the membrane, investing the spinal marrow. I am inclined to believe, that the corpora vertebrarum, how soever softened, diseased, or rendered ca- rious, they may be, are never found spread, and enlarged in their texture : at least, I have never seen them expanded in this way, though I have several times examined the parts after death. The curvature of the spine, attendant on the present dis- ease, is always from within outward, and is invariably pre- ceded, as well as the paralytic affection of the legs, by a distempered state of the ligaments and bones. TREATMENT. The only thing, from which relief is ever obtained in the present distressing affliction, is an issue, made on each side of the spinous processes of the affected vertebrae. The best mode of forming the issues is to rub the kali purum cum calce viva on the skin, until the part turns brown. To accomplish this object in a neat manner, it is as well to cover and defend the integuments by adhesive plaster,

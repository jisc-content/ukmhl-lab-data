The disease generally occupies no great length of the passage, not extending further than it it vere produced by the urethra being surrounded with a piece of packthread. However, though this is the com- mon occurrence, the urethra, in some instances, is, un- doubtedly, contracted for more than an inch of its length. In certain cases, the canal widens very gradually in each direction from the most contracted point, so that the shape of this part of the tube may be considered as resembling two long cones, with their points in contact. I am perfectly convinced, that this is the case, which frequently baffles the operation of caustic, and which receives most benefit from the employment of common bougies. A stricture may also arise from a contraction ot only one side of the urethra. Whenever there is only one stricture, it is most commonly just behind the bulb of the urethra; the dis- tance from the external orifice being six and a half, or se- ven inches. Whenever there are other stiictures further forward, which is mostly the case, a stricture, which may be considered as the original one, will almost always be found to exist at the above part of the canal. > A true permanent stricture, unless very inveterate, or so advanced as to have rendered the urethra impervious, and to have occasioned fistulous openings in the perineum, is strictly capable of a further spasmodic, or muscular con - traction. This is clearly proved, by all strictures being less troublesome in warm, than in cold weather. The fit of an ague, violent exorcise, hard drinking, and retaining the urine too long, after an inclination to void it has been felt, are all circumstances capable of aggravating the in- conveniences of strictures, by adding a spasmodic kind of contraction to that, which is permanent, i SYMPTOMS OF STRICTURES. The most, early symptom is a diminution in the stream of urine, which, however, is usually disregarded, until the ex-

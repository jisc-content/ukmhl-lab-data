170 FIRST FINES OF THE scess, which may be reckoned strumous disorders, will be noticed in the second part of the work. GENERAL REMARKS ON THE TREATMENT OF SCROPHULA. There is no medicine which, internally administered, has the power of completely correcting the peculiarity of constitution implied by the term scrophulous habit. But there are many medicines which seem to improve this state of the system, and to promote the spontaneous amendment, which strumous affections frequently undergo. Scrophu- lous subjects are possessed of constitutions, in which the natural actions do not proceed with vigour, and it is per- haps on this account that every thing tonic is more or less Useful in cases of-strumous disease. Bark, sea-air and sea-bathing, are among those means, from which patients afflicted with scrophula derive most relief. The muriated barytes has been recommended by Dr. Crawford ; but repeated trials have not greatly in- creased the repute which this medicine suddenly obtained. Mr. Burns gives the following formula ; IP Terras ponder, salit. chryst. gr. x. Aq. font. Aq. cassias utriusque uncias iij. Syrupi Aurentii uncias ij.—To begin with a dos« of|fs twice or three times a day. ' , Burnt sponge, and natron ptt.* are extremely service- able in the relief of scrophula. Cicuta has been greatly recommended, and it ought to he noticed, that its efficacy is chiefly apparent, when given jn cases where there are scrophulous sores of a more irrita- ble nature than common. Mercury, when exhibited so as to produce a salivation, is always hurtful; the only way in which it does good is as an alterative ; and calomel, or the corrosive sublimate, is file most eligible preparation. . * >P Natri ppt. 3j.

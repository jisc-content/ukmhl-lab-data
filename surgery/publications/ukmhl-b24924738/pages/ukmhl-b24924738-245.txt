PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 211 Until the lacerated ligaments, tendons, &c. have had an op- portunity of uniting. . . In cases of compound dislocations it is a most important point to obtain a prompt union of the wound, as the in- jury can afterwards only be regarded as one of a simple kind. The lips of the wound arc, therefore, to be brought accurately together with sticking plaster, and the joint kept perfectly quiet in splints. , In order to reduce dislocations without difficulty, it is necessary to consider what muscles have the power of op- posing your attempt to bring the dislocated head ot the bone into its proper place, and these should be relaxed at the time when the extension is made. The position in which the limb ought to be placed until the ligaments have united, ought to be determined on the same&principies as in cases of fractures. Dislocations, however, when reduced, are* in general, not so trouble- some to keep right as fractures, and are not so easily dis- placed by the actionÂ® of muscles. The modes of reducing particular luxations will be no- ticed hereafter. It must be exceedingly bad practice ever to satf off the protruding end of a dislocated bone in compound cases. The bone may always be replaced; and what good the pro- posers of this plan can have in view is difficult ot concep- tion. Old luxations can hardly ever be reduced; for not only the muscles become permanently shortened, and the articu- lar cavity more or less obliterated, but the head ot the dis- located bone acquires adhesions to the parts in its new si- tuation. Though dislocations arc commonly occasioned by ex- ternal force, they arc, now and then, the consequence of disease in the joints. We have already noticed* how a luxation of the thigh bone is caused, in the disease of the hip, by the destruction of the circumference of the accta,*

452 FIRST LINES OF THE i nal appearance of the parts being natural. The impedi- ment to the passage of the excrement may be ascertained by introducing the little finger Into the rectum, or, -when this is impracticable, by using a probe. If the obstruction is near the end of the rectum, a division of it might be made with a narrow knife, M. Sabatier recommends cut- ting from the sacrum, towards the scrotum, or pudenda. Any stoppage, situated far up,the intestine, can only be re- moved by puncturing it with a trocar, introduced through a cannula. The instrument should have a curve, corres- ponding .to the semilunar form of the rectum. This ope- ration is performed, as it were, in the dark, and is by no pietans a pleasant one to undertake. The third kind of imperforated anus presents nothing externally, by which the situation of the end of the intes- tine is indicated. This part may be so remote, that it would be impossible to find it by any practicable method. How can cutting instruments be employed in so deep a si- tuation ? If the operator were to succeed in procuring ap exit for the meconium, through what a thickness of parts would it not have to pass ? The light of anatomy, as M. Sabatier observes, would here be invoked in vain. Almost all infants have died soon after an operation for this sort of imperforation, even though the rectum had been found, and opened. In these cases, it has been proposed by Littre to cut into the abdomen above the left groin, and to endeavour to esta- blish an artificial anus, by opening the colon in this situa- tion. Such an operation, indeed, seems to have been prac- tised with success, by a French surgeon, named Du ret,

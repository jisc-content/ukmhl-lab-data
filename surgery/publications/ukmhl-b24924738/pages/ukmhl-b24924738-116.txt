FIRST LINES OF THE S4 ball enters, Cannon balls often strike limbs without the neighbouring parts being in the least hurt. There is as little foundation for attributing the injury to electricity, produced by the violent friction of the ball in the bore ot the gun, and said to be communicated to the injured part ; for metals do not become electric from fric- tion. It is highly probable the injury is caused immediately by the ball itself. Its occasioning a violent contusion without wounding the skin, or entering the limb, is to be ascribed to the sloping direction in which it first st rikes the surface. KINDS OK EXTRANEOUS BODIES USUALLY LODCED IN GUNSHOT WOUNDS. Extraneous bodies are more frequently met with in gun- shot wounds than in any others. They are commonly of three sorts: 1. Pieces of clothing, or other substances, which the ball has driven into the limb : 2. the ball itself: 3. or, lastly, loose, splintered portions of bone. Such foreign bodies are the causes of many bad symp- toms. They irritate the sensible parts, exciting pain, in- flammation, a disposition to hemorrhage, copious, and long-continued suppuration, &c. The more uneven, pointed, and hard such foreign bodies are, the more they arc apt to create these unpleasant occurrences. EFFECTS OF TIJE SHOCK OF SOME GUNSHOT WOUNDS ON THE NEIGHBOURING PARTS, AND THE WHOLE MA- CHINE. When a ball strikes a bone a concussion happens. If trivial, its eflect is limited to the seat of injury. Some- times the shock extends to the nearest articulation, where it occasionally produces inflammation and suppuration. When a cannon ball tears olf a whole limb, it may cause a concussion of the n hole body in a very violent degree.

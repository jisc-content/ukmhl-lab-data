PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 371 should be concentrated in the direction upward and out- ward, so as to press the contents of the hernia towards the ring. The external oblique muscle should be relaxed. For this purpose the thorax should be elevated, and turned towards the opposite side. Since, also, the femoral fas- cia, when tense) tightens Poupart’s ligament, and may thus, in some degree, straiten the abdominal ling, the thigh should be bent, and rotated inward. In the femoral hernia the viscera descend downward and outward, and the pressure should therefore be made up- ward and inward. The external oblique muscle should be relaxed, and the thigh bent, as in the case of bubonocele - Gimbernat and Mr. Hey have apprised the public, that in femoral hernia; the stricture is -not made, as was supposed, by Poupart’s ligament, but by a band of ligamentous fibres, situated more deeply, to which we shall advert in describing the operation* But as this band is connected with Poupart’s ligament, the relaxation of the latter must necessarily also relax the former part. When manual attempts at reduction have failed, other auxiliary means should immediately be tried. In the opi- nion of the most experienced men, bleeding, cathartics, clysters, cold topical applications, the warm bath, and to- bacco smoke or decoction, introduced into the intestines, arc the most efficacious* Yet it is not enough to possess this information , for to render our knowledge likely to be productive of a judicious practice, it behoves us to learn precisely what degree of reliance should bo placed upon each of these means, and the exact order in which they ought, to be tried, so as to procure the greatest chance of relief, without occasioning any hazardous delay, beyond that critical moment, at which the operation is most strong- ly indicated. When reduction by the hand proves impracticable, I am inclined to think venesection should be immediately Bli 2

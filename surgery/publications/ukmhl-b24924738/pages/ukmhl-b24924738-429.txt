When the testicle, however, has not completely descend- ed, a truss should not he worn, as it would prevent this part from arriving in its proper situation. In performing an operation to relieve a strangulated congenital hernia, the tunica vaginalis is to be opened in the same manner as a common hernial sac, and the stric- ture divided either directly upward, or upward and out- ward. . ■, The surgeon should examine with his finger, to ascertain whether the incarceration is produced by the transversalis, or by the orifice of the tunica vaginalis. In the first case the bistoury need not, in Mr. A. Cooper’s opinion, be in- troduced within the neck of the latter part. HERNIA or THE BLADDER. This case differs from every other species of hernia, in having no hernial sac covering the protruded viscus. The peculiarity is entirely owing to the bladder being actually situated on the outside of the cavity of the peritoneum, it is true this membrane, w here it forms a kind of a parti- tion, between the abdomen and pelvis, covers the fundus and posterior surface of the bladder as far as the insertion of.the ureters ; but when, by the reiterated pressure of the neighbouring parts, this viscus is made to protrude through one of the abdominal wings, its anterior, or rather lateral part, will be the first to make its exit, in consequence of being nearest the aperture. But before the protrusion takes place, the above part of the bladder must separate that portion of the peritoneum which lines the inside of the abdominal ring. The ante- c c 2 *

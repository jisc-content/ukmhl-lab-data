PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 4453 I â–  / CHAP. LIII. FISTULA IN ANO. ' i THIS terra is applied to every abscess in the vicinity of the anus, but very improperly ; for the idea of there being a fistula naturally leads to the adoption of measures, to- tally different from those, which are applicable to common Sr ' abscesses. Sometimes the complaint makes its attack, in the form of phlegmonous inflammation, attended with sympathetic fever. A part of the buttock near the anus is considerably swollen, and has a large circumscribed hardness. The middle of this hardness soon becomes very red, and matter forms in its centre. As Mr. Pott remarks, the pain is sometimes great, the fever high, the tumour large and ex- quisitely tender; but, however high the symptoms may have risen, before suppuration, yet, when that end is fairly and fully accomplished, the patient generally becomes easy, and free from fever. The matter, though plentiful, is good. On other occasions, the fistula in ano begins as an erysi- pelatous inflammation, without any of the circumscribed hardness, which characterizes the preceding tumour. The affection, on the contrary, spreads more extensively ; the disease is more superficial; the quantity of matier small, and the cellular membrane sloughy to a considerable ex-; tent. Sometimes the complaint begins somewhat like a car- buncle. Die skin is of a dusky red, or purple kind of co- lour, and, although harder than in the natural s'ate, yet it is not nearly so tense as in phlegmonous, or erysipelatous inflammation.

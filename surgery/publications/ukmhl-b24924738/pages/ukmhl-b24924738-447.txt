PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 40.5 most pari, similar to such as excite this affection in oilier parts. A bruise may occasion a hernia huinprn*Iis ; we see it purposely caused by (he surgeon, when he underlakes the radical cure of a hydrocele. But (liemost common cause of tin's complaint is irritation of the urethra. Hence it more frequently arises in consequence of a gonorrhoea than any other cause; and persons with very bad stric- tures, for which they arc using bougies, are very much ex- posed to its attack. It is very remarkable, that in cases of gonorrhoea, the pain in making water, and the quantity of the discharge, are almost always very suddenly diminish- ed, as soon as the testicle begins to enlarge; the discharge, indeed, is frequently quite stopped. This curious circum- stance has attracted a great deal of attention, and has been repeatedly adduced by theorists as a proof of the metastasis of a disease, or of a sympathy between the testicle and urethra. Jjeaving these abstruse points to the considera- tion ot such readers as may feel inclined to theorize upon the subject, I shall rest contented with merely knowing and mentioning the fact, that the occurrence of hernia hu- moralis usually produces a sudden, and considerable, di- minution, and even a total cessation, of the strangury, and discharge from the urethra, in cases of gonorrhoea. This amendment, in the latter complaint, continues till the ve- hemence of the hernia humoralis has abated, and then the pain in making water, and the copious discharge, fre- quently recur.

If he be young and robust, the swelling ol the part considerable, and the pain in the loins very violent, phlebotomy may be practised. In almost every case, however, bleeding with leeches is to be repeat-

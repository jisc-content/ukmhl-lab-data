FIRST LINES OF THE S26 adhesions between the pleura costalis, and pleura puhno- nalis. ^^en, however, air has entered the bag of the pleura through the wound, it is partly forced out again when the muscles of expiration diminish the capacity of the thorax. It is a wise arrangement to have no communication be- tween the two bags of the pleura: if it were not so or- dained, suffocation \Vould be a common consequence of large wounds extending into the chest. Bertrandi informs us, that if a free opening is made into each side of the chest m an animal, suffocation is always the consequence, be- cause both lungs collapse. We shall next notice the most urgent symptoms likely to follow wounds of the chest, and the method of treating them. EMPHYSEMA. This is a term applied to a swelling, arising from a dif- fusion of air among the cells of the cellular substance. This symptom may occur from wounds that just enter the cavity of the chest; in others, that extend more deeply, so as to wound the lungs; and also in cases where these organs are wounded by the spiculce of a broken rib or cla- vicle. I believe emphysema is never very extensive, un- less the air vesicles oi the lungs are injured, and' there is no outer wound ihrough which the air can freely make its escape. Hence we find, that emphysema is a more com- mon consequence of fractured ribs and narrow stabs than of large penetrating wounds ; because in the latter cases the air readily passes and repasses through the opening. When the vesicles of the lungs are wounded, the air, at toe time of expiration, is compressed out of these organs, partly through the wound, but principally through the trachea, as in the natural state. Thus some of the air gets into the cavity of the thorax. But as the pleura costalis,

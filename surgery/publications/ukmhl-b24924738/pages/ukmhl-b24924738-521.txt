PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 473 at the lowest part of this viscus, the sound is usually made less curved than a catheter, in order that it may more easily touch any thing situated immediately behind, and below, the neck of the bladder. The sound is only a particular kind of probe, and, as its chief use is to convey informa- tion, through the medium of the organ of touch, its handle should be smooth and well polished, so that as many points of its surface may be in contact with the fingers as pos- sible. The mode of introducing this instrument is the same, as that of passing a catheter. When it is in the bladder, it is to be pushed downward, to ascertain, whether the stone lies beneath its convexity. If the extraneous body should not be felt in this manner, the instrument may be turned first to one, and then to the other side of the cavity of the bladder. Should the stone not be struck by moving the sound in this manner, the in- strument may be drawn forward, for the purpose of learn- ing, whether the calculus is more anteriorly situated. Frequently, the stone cannot be felt till the whole of the urine has been expelled, and the bladder lias become con- tracted. Sometimes the sound may be made to strike against the stone, by introducing the finger into the rec- tum, and thus raising the extraneous body upward. The calculus is even very often distinctly perceptible to the finger. Surgeons make it an invariable rule never to perform lithotomy, unless the stone can be plainly stricken by the sound, or staff, immediately before the operation. A man may have a stone in the bladder to day, and the surgeon may strike it so manifestly with the sound, as to make the circumstance perceptible to the cars of (lie byestanders, as well as to his own fingers; but to-morrow the stone may have protruded through the fasciculi of the muscular coat of the bladder, carrying along witli it a pouch, formed by' the lining ot this viscus, and, in this circumstance, the

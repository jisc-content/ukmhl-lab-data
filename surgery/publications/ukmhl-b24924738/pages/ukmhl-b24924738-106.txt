The edges of this kind of wound are irregular and jagged. A contused mound is occasioned by the collision of a blunt instrument againsta part of the body. Both these sorts of wounds are much more perilous than incised ones. Wounds made with sharp instruments are frequently attended with vast retraction of the divided parts, and profuse hemorrhage; but it is known, at the same time, that they are generally capable of being united by tire first intention. It is almost a constant effect of la- cerated and contused wounds to pour forth very little blood, even when important blood vessels have been injured. Whole limbs have been torn from the body without the oc- currence of bleeding. The experienced practitioner is not deceived by the absence of this symptom; for he knows that in proportion as the bleeding from large contused and lacerated wounds is trivial, the violence applied to the in- jured parts has been great. TREATMENT OF CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS. In these wounds we do not find the same disposition to unite, which is observed in simple incisions. They are not mere breaches of continuity, but injuries attended will)

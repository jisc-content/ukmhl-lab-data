4:7 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. CHAP. XLIV. PHYMOSIS AND PARAPHYMOSIS. WHEN the opening of the prepuce is so much con* traded, that this part cannot be drawn backward, the complaint is termed phymosis. On the other hand, when the prepuce is drawn backward, behind the glans, and cannot be brought forward again, the malady receives the name of paraphymosis. These diseases arise from a thickening of the cellular substance of the prepuce, in consequence of some species ot irritation. This is most frequently produced by a chancre; but it is also very often the result of a common gonorrhoea, or ol inflammation and excoriations beneath the prepuce, which are common in persons, who neglect cleanliness, and allow the natural sebaceous secretions to lodge, and become acrid. The inflammation of the pre- puce is sometimes vehement, and of the erysipelatous kind, i he pait often has an anasarcous appearance, owing to the extravasation of serum. Many persons are born with a contraction of the aperture of the prepuce; and the phymosis is then called a natural one. 1 he paraphymosis very frequently follows the phymo- sis, by the prepuce being improperly drawn backward be- hind the glans. In this circumstance the constricted part ot the prepuce acts as a ligature round the body of the pe- nis, and retards the return of blood from the glans, and the portion of the prepuce beyond the stricture. Hence an cedematous inflammation attacks the latter, and the former part becomes prodigiously distended. In adults, and par- ticularly old persons, sometimes the prepuce contracts so much, without any evident cause, that its cavity becomes

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. Si CHAP. XIX. GUNSHOT WOUNDS ARE produced by hard obtuse bodies, projected from some species of fire-arms, and violently penetrating the living solids. The differences of gunshot wounds are referrible to three principal causes. 1. The kind of body projected. 2. The velocity of the body. 3. The nature and peculiarities of the parts injured. 1. KIXD OF body PROJECTED. , Former surgeons seeing the terrible mischief frequently arising from gunshot wounds, entertained a suspicion that the injured parts were either dreadfully burnt by the heat of the projected body, or were irritated by the presence of poison, as well as by mechanical violence. The moderns, better acquainted with the component ingredients of gun- powder, rightly attribute the ill consequences of gunshot wounds to the violence, contusion, and laceration, indicted on the wounded parts. This violence, produced in ge- neral by such an obtuse body as a musket ball, and often done with immense velocity, cannot fail to be j reductive of a high degree of inflammation. Bullets are the most com- mon bodies shot into the injured parts; but the wound may be produced by cannon balls, pieces of broken shells, and, very olten onboard ofship, by splinters of wood. Large bodies of irregular figure, it is obvious, must occasion a greater quantity of mischief than such as are externally smooth, of a round form, and of moderate size. Pieces of clothes are often carried along with (he ball into the wound. But gunshot wounds, by what bodies soever produced, G

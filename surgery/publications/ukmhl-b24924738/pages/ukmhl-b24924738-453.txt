411 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. aoon as tl,c sore was skinned over, in order to see what parts wonld next be affected. • . About three months afterwards, copper-colonrcd blotches made their appearance in the skin, and the ulcer on the tonsil recurred. This disease was again only palliated J mercury ; but the complaints returned m the same situa- tion as before; and were ultimately cured by a proper quantity of mercury. On the other hand, doubts must exist concerning this account of the matter of gonorrhoea, when the following circumstances are taken into consideration . 1st. It is impossible to say what time may elapse between the application of venereal poison to the penis, and the commencement of ulceration. Therefore, Bougainville’s sailors, alluded toby Mr. Hunter, might have contracted the infection at Rio de la Plata; but actual ulcers on the penis might not have formed till about live months after- wards, when the ship arrived at Otaheite. 2dly. The se- cond argument adduced by Mr. Hunter is certainly incon- clusive. Every ulcer in the throat is not regularly vene- real. A common ulcer may heal while the paiient is using mercury. Hence the cure, apparently accomplished by this medicine, is no proof that the complaint was syphili- tic. Sdly. The last fact of inoculation is undoubtedly very strong. But though the insertion of gonorrhoeal mat- ter, or any other morbid matter, beneath the cuticle, will undoubtedly produce troublesome local complaints, may wc not doubt that the sores, in the above case, were ac- tually venereal ohes ? Can we implicitly depend on the continence of the subject of the above remarkable experi- ments, during the long space of four months, between the healing of the sore on the prepuce, and its recurrence ? If we cannot, the inference, in regard to the power ot go- norrhoeal matter to communicate the venereal disease, re- mains unestablished. How much more conclusive, in this respect, the experiments would have been, had the inocu-

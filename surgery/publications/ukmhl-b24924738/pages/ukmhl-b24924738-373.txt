PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 331 treatment. When a wound of the lungs is not immediately mortal, the -rand surgical indication is to keep the consequent pe- ripnetunony from becoming so violent as to occasion death, or supparsu ion tri the oh st. The antiphlogistic treatment, in the full sense of the expression, is to be put into prac- tice, and, in a most particular manner, bleeding. The lancet must be used a often as the pulse betrays the least disposition to rise. Le Dran bled one man, whom be cured of a wound of this description, not less than fifteen times.

A cough is, above all things, to be appeased, as it creates immense disturbance of the wounded parts. The dressings are to be merely superficial. The intro- duction of tents is very seriously hurtful. After a few days the lungs usually contract an adhesion to (he pleura costalis, at the circumference of the wound ; and this con- nexion, which is desirable, because it prevents the insinua- tion of matter into the chest, is very likely to be hindered from taking place by the irritation of tents. YVhen the lungs happen to be wounded in the centre of an adhesion between the pleura pulmonalis, and pleura costalis, it is a fortunate circumstance, as there is then no chance of air, blood, and pus, finding their way into the cavity of the thorax. Great*constitutional derangement sometimes occurs im- mediately alter a wound of the lungs : such as feeble respi- ration ; a small, almost imperceptible pulse; Vomiting; coughing ; coldness of the extremities ; swooning, &c. As * long as such symptoms exist, phlebotomy may be deferred,' and opium is the best medicine. But immediately the pa-

PRACTICE OF SURGEtlY. 30? native, and applying a ligature both below and above the wound, is the onlystep that affords the smallest chance of preserving life, In passing the ligatures beneath the vessel, great caution is requisite; for the eighth pair of nerves lie close to it, included in the same sheath of cellu- lar substance. The situation of this nerve is on the out- side of the artery, between it and the jugular vein. In- cluding it in a ligature with the artery would alone be an adequate cause of death. Whether suddenly tying the trunk of the carotid ar- tery vould produce any bad effect on the brain is un- known. I have seen it tied by Mr. Abernethy in are- markable case, which that gentleman has related in a pub- lication,* to which I beg leave to refer the reader. No apparent derangement in the functions of the brain ensued for several hours after the ligature was applied. But the patient afterwards relapsed into a state, similar to that of a person who has suffered concussion of the brain, and he died on the following morning. However, in the case there were particular circumstances, from which dif- ferent persons might draw different conclusions, with re- gard to the cause of the brain being affected. 1 lie narra- tive of the case, in Mr. Abernethyâ€™s own words, is highly deserving of attention. This excellent surgeon recommends, as I mentioned be- fore in the chapter on Aneurisms, a very safe method of passing a ligature beneath the trunk of the carotid, incase of necessity. An incision is to be made on that side of the artery, which is next to the trachea, where no important parts can be injured, and where the finger can be intro- duced under the vessel so as to compress it. An aneurism needle is then to be passed with a ligature behind the ar- tery, and Us eye-part is to be brought up as cjose as pos- * Surgical Observations. 18Q4.

7S FIRST LINES OF THE edges ol a wound. But how these edges become approxi- mated, during the granulating process, is not so well under- stood. It has been said that it arises from the diminution of the swelling that surrounds the wound. This is by no means a satisfactory explanation, because we know that the separation ot the edges proceeds from a ditferent cause, and takes place prior to the swelling, and immediately on the occurrence of the wound. Mr. Hunter attributed the beneficial effect to a contraction of the granulations. He says: u The contraction takes place in every point, but “ principally from edge to edge, which brings the cir- <c cumference of the sore towards the centre, so that the “ sore becomes smaller and smaller, although there is “ little or no new skin formed.” This contraction of granulations takes place in a greater degree, and has a greater effect, when there is a looseness of the parts on which they are formed. When they are formed on parts naturally fixed, as the scull, shin, &c. the contraction is impeded. This contraction of granulations is not confined to open wounds ; it takes place in the cavities of abscesses, which by this means contract, like the urinary bladder, till little or no cavity is left. When the granulations cannot con- tract further, if any cavity be remaining, it is obliterated by the opposite granulations growing into each other. Besides the contractile power of the granulations, there is also a similar power in the surrounding edge of the cica- trizing skin. As the granulations contract, the old skin becomes ex- tended over the part which had been deprived of skin. Mr. Hunter thought this elongation of the old skin not the mechanical effect of its being stretched, but the conse- quence of what he would term interstitial growth. The contraction of granulations appears one of the most beautiful examples for illustrating the wisdom with which the natural principles of our body have been established.

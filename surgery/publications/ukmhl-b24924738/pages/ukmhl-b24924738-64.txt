FIRST LINES OF THE 34 the erysipelas commonly conics out when the febrile symp- toms cease. The most violent form of erysipelas is most often seen attacking the face. It is preceded by excessive disturb- ance of the constitution. Even delirium sometimes occurs, which does not cease on theeruption of the erysipelas, but continues till it vanishes. This usually happens about the eleventh day. CAUSES. Erysipelas is intimately dependant on the state of the constitution. Persons in the habit of drunkenness, and other species ot intemperance, and w ho, in a state of in- toxication, meet with local injuries, often ha\e erysipela- tous inflammation in consequence of them. Other sub- jects, who lead more regular lives, when they meet with similar injuries, experience healthy inflammation. In general, erysipelas lias its principal source in a dis- ordered state of the cbylopoietic viscera, and, perhaps, mostly in a wrong state of the bilious secretion. It seemsj, also, to be often connected with a suppression of perspira- tion ; for it never recedes until this symptom is relieved. CONSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT OF ERYSIPELAS. Th# mild erysipelas is relieved by any gentle diaphore- tic. A few doses of nitre to promote the ordinary evacua- tions ; the breathing of pure, fresh air ; and the antiphlo- gistic regimen, are also very serviceable, But, as in most cases, the bowels are out of order, it is necessary to give a mild purgative, such as the natron xi- triolalum, or pulv. rhcci. Sometimes venesection is proper when the case is cor.- joined with phlegmon; when there are symptoms of in- flammatory fever present; when the marks of bilious disor- der are not considerable ; and, particularly, when the face isdheseat of the attack.

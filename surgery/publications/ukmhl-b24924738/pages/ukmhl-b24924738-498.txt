FIRST LINES OF THE 1 456 CHAP. L. INCONTINENCE OF URINE. AN inability to retain the urine in the bladder is of three kinds : in one the water continually dribbles away 'without any inclination to void it, or any sensation of its being voided. In other instances, the patient can hold his nrine in a certain degree; but the propensity to evacuate it comes on so frequently, suddenly, and irresistibly, that lie is compelled to make water. The third kind of incon- tmence only occurs during night, when the patient is asleep. The first kind of incontinence depends on a weakness, or total paralysis of the sphincter muscle of the bladder! As the neck of this organ is constantly open, every drop of urine escapes into the urethra, immediately it has descend- ed from the ureters, and does not lodge in the bladder at all. Sometimes the weakness, or paralysis of the sphincter muscle is quite a local disorder ; but, most frequently, it is only symptomatic of some other affection. In the first case, it is often the consequence of a'difficult labour, in which the neck of the bladder has been a long while com- pressed ; or of the distention, caused by a stone lodged at this part of the viscus. Sometimes, incontinence of urine depends on a malformation of the urinary passages, and exists from the time ot birth. The complaintis often only an effect of apoplexy, injuries and diseases of the spine, &c. ' . , If Is not dangerous, though exceedingly annoying, in consequence of its continually wetting the clothes, causing a disagreeable smell, and even excoriating parts, over which the urine flows.

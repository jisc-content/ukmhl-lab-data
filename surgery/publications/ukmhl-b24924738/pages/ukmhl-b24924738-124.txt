FIRST lines of the irregular, jagged, and highly dangerous! wound. As the limb has sometimes endured a furious concussion, and is almost senseless and motionless, the bone beino- at the same time often split upward, it is also advised to perform am- putatioii, if possible, above the nearest joint. Others condemn the operation in this instance, on the ground that such wounds are disposed to end favourably without amputation, and that the state of the system does not admit of the operation being done with the best pros- pect of success. But as when the operation is not done, an irregular wound of this description requires considerable inbisions tor the extraction of foreign bodies, the discharge 6f mat- ter, and for the purpose of shortening the projecting mus- cles and tendons, the last objection to amputation is not extremely weighty. Such incisions would produce as much, and even more, irritation than amputation, without the production of equal good. Besides, Hie urgency for the operation is, in many cases, not so great, but that it mav be delayed till the irritability of the whole bodv, arising from,the injury, has subsided. Such wounds having been occasionally cured without amputation, evinces nothing more than that in a few in- stances it is not impossible to cure them without the opera- tion. J he surgeon may here more readily make up his mind to amputate, as the loss of a limb is not in question. However, the injury may, in particular case's, be so conditioned, that the performance of amputation would not only be unnecessary, but injurious. With respect to amputating above the nearest joint, this must depend on the distance of the injury from the articu- lation : n6 one would think of amputating above the knee when the acccident is situated near the ankle.

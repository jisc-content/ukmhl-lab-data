> FIRST LINES OF THE 304 1 he tonsils sometimes become enlarged, without being inflamed. This swelling is improperly termed scirrlius. The glands are only swollen, and of moderate firmness. A portion ol such an enlarged tonsil may be cut off, without the least danger-of the rest assuming a malignant nature.- This preternatural swelling of the tonsils is mostly owing to repeated inflammations. Sometimes there is no palpable cause. The malady is constantly free from pain. When the tumefaction is considerable, it obstructs the speech, deglutition, and respiration. Biscutient and astringent applications prove ineffectual. Tiie tumour must be diminished by a surgical operation. But it is unnecessary and improper to remove the whole tonsil. A dangerous hemorrhage might be the consequence. Only so much of the swelling should be taken away as is sufficient to afford relief. The remaining portion commonly heals without the least difficulty: a clear proof that the disease is not of a malignant or cancerous nature. I he extirpation of part of a tonsil thus diseased has been . accomplished by caustics, the actual cautery, the ligature, and cutting instruments. The first is now quite abandon- ed, and the second also, as no modern surgeons employ it, except now and then, with a view of destroying fun- gous excrescences, which, in a few instances, originate after a part of the tumour lias been removed by some other operation. Some very good surgeons still prefer tying diseased ton- sils to cutting them away, and the mode to be adopted differs according as the swelling has a narrow or broad base. The ligature ought to be made of silver wire, or catgut. When the tumour has a narrow neck the liga- tuie is to be doubled and introduced through the nostril, so that the noose becomes visible in the throat. With the aid of a pair of forceps, the noose may then be easily placed round the neck of the tumour. The ends of the ligature arc then to be brought through a double cannula, and the

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. ^29 breathing increases, while the emphysema spreads, it is then rational to conclude that the air escapes from a wound of the lungs into the cavity of the thorax, and thence into the cellular substance in tlje vicinity of the external wound. In this circumstance the air must be allowed to pass and repass through the wpund, until sufficient time has been allowed for the wound in the lungs to be closed by coagu- lating lymph; and if the symptoms of pressure on the Jungs are very urgent, and the air does not very readily escape through the wpund, it is proper cither to enlarge it, if conveniently situated, or to make another opening into the bag of the pleura. The mode of performing paracen- tesis thoracis will be mentioned hereafter. In emphyse- matous cases a very small, but direct and pervious opening is proper; for if there be much air compressing the lungs, it will escape through a small, as well as a large opening, and without so much chance of inflammation as when a large one is made. In five or six days we may generally conclude that the wound in the lungs is healed ; and this may be known by the great diminution in the quantity of air issuing through the wound. The external wound may now be closed ; and the lungs will gradually expand, as the air is ab- sorbed. Bandages round the chest, in emphysematous oases, must, generally' speaking, be exceedingly improper, as long as air passes from the wounded lung into the bag of the pleura. They must strongly tend to prevent the air issu- ing from the chest, and therefore augment the degree of compression on the lungs. ^ydien the emphysema is large, it is always proper to give an outlet to the air, by making small punctures in va- rious situations, and promoting its exit by frictions. In- deed the surgeon is always to be content with this prac- tice, unless the symptoms of compression on the diaphragm ^nd opposite lung, and the approach of suffocation, de-

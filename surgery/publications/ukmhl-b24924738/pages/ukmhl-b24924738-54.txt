24 FIRST LTNfcS OF THE exercised in deciding liow long it. is safe to oppose the power of medical surgery to the influence of an obstinate local disease on the constitution. For, although patients in an abject state of weakness, arising from irremediable local disease, have oftentimes been restored to health by a removal of the morbid part, yet many have been suffered to sink so low that no future treatment could relieve them.

A\ hen an incurable disease in an extremity is removed by amputation, the hectic fever immediately begins to abate. “ I have known,” says John Hunter, “ a hectic “ pulse at 120 sink to 90 in a few hours, upon the remo- val of the hectic cause; I have known persons sleep cc soundly the first night, without an opiate, who had not U slept tolerably for weeks before; I have known cold c‘ sweats stop immediately, as well as those called colli- “ quative ; I have known a purging stop immediately “ upon the removal of the hectic cause, and the urine drop its sediment.” Iam afiaid no medicine has the direct power of com- municating strength to the human constitution.

Nourishing food, easy of di- gestion, should he taken frequently, and in moderate quantities at a time. Gentle cordial, and aromatic draughts, often prove ex- ceedingly useful in these cases.

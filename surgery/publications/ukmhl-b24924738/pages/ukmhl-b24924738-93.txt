An incised wound, made with a clean, sharp instrument, can obviously have no foreign bodies in it. But very con- siderable cuts arc often produced by glass, which is apt to lmrak at the moment, and leave some of its fragme tsin them. As extraneous bodies operate as an irritation to all wounds, and are particularly inimical to their speedy union, great attention should be paid to having such things removed as speedily as possible. Surgeons are divided in sentiment, whether the clots of blood, frequently found on the surface of wounds, ought to be regarded in the light of an extraneous body. Hunter considered blood, retaining the living principle, as a sub- stance rather useful than otherwise; but blood which had been deprived of this principle by long exposure, the ef- fect of styptics, &c. was regarded by that great man as an mjttraneous matter. As far as my own observation ex- tends, I think a considerable quantity of blood on the sur- face of wounds has 'generally seemed to retard the cure. UNION BY THE FIRST INTENTION. AV oundsare healed by two processes : one, in which pus is produced ; and another, in which no suppuration takes place. The latter, when practicable, is always the best, because it is not only the most direct means of cure, it is also the most perfect. Surgeons have termed it union bif

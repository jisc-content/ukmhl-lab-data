475 FIRST LINES OF THE so as to cover the external surface. The uterus now lianas down at the labia, between which and. the viscus there is no interspace, into which the finger, or probe, can lie intro- ' duced. This case cannot happen without the bladder and rectum being considerably deranged, in regard to posi- tion. The first is always drawn backward, so as to take the natural situation of the uterus, and assume, as well as the meatus urinarius, a horizontal position. Hence, we see in what direction a catheter should generally be intro- duced in these cases. As the return of blood from the prolapsed uterus is usually more or less obstructed, the part frequently be- comes very much swollen, and even copious discharges of blood occur. The naturally delicate texture of the lining of the vagina undergoes such an alteration, that iiseems more like the s'rucure of the common integuments. The triction of the clo'hes on the swelling, however, mostly occasions very painful ulcerations on the outside of the vagina, if the prolapsus should be recent. But when the parts have been long down, they adapt them- selves to their new situation, and hence we see an old negr lected prolapsus attended with no particular occurrences, except the descent of the tumour, when the patient is erect, and its return when she is in a recumbent posture. Polypi are the only disease, with which the prolapsus uteri can be confounded ; and the mode of discrimination must.be learnt by referring to the chapter on this other subject. The causes of theprolapsus uteri are such as either relax the parts retaining the ulerns in its natural position, or such as force this organ downward. Women, who have had many children, are particularly subject to the complaint. The prolapsus is also very liable to occur soon after deli- very, when all the parts of generation are dilated and re- laxed . The second class of causes are any great exertions, or

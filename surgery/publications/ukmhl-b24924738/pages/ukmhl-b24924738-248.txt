214 FIRST FINES OF TIIE that of a fracture, with depression of the cranium, ns may be easily mistaken. Mild purges, and the lotion of vine- gar and sal ammoniac,' commonly very so'on occasion the absorption of the effused blood. Cuts of the integuments of the head, without injury of the skull, are simple wounds, unattended with any pecu- liarity. They admit of direct union, unless it is inter- rupted by some incidental circumstance. Many contused and lacerated wounds of the scalp may also be united. The flaps, angles, and detached portions of these wounds, provided they are connected with the rest of the scalp at some point or another, ought never to be removed, so as to cause an unnecessary exposure of the cranium; they ought to be carefully laid down, and in very many in- stances they will be found to live and unite to the surround- ing part of the scalp. The success of the attempt w ill de- pend, in a great measure, on the degree of contusion that lias been inflicted. I shall only mention, on this subject, one additional case, in which the integuments of the head become affected with an erysipelatous inflammation, in consequence of a wound or bruise. This is particularly common in persons habituated to inebriety, and in bilious subjects. Bleeding, saline purges, and cold saturnine applications, are, in ge- neral, sufficient for the production of a cure. FRACTURES OF THE CRANIUM, When the breach of continuity in the bone is very fine, it is termed a Jissure ; when wide and open it is named a fracture. When the fracture happens in a situation, at some distance from the spot on which the external violence immediately operated, it is denominated a counter Jissure. The skull, at the fractured part, either continues on a level with the rest of the cranium, or it is depressed. Fractures of the cranium, abstractedly considered, are quite destitute of danger and evil consequences* This is

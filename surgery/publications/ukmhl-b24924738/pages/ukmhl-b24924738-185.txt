151 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. that the impetus of the blood must frequently have a con- siderable share in its origin. The true aneurisms, as Monro justly fir ought, occur as often in the aorta, parti- cularly its arch, as in all other arteries together. They frequently occur in the ham, and wherever the arteries run unsurrounded by muscles, and are most exposed to exter- nal violence. It very frequently happens that patients have several aneurisms at the same time, and that the artery is diseased for a considerable extent from each tumour. In this case, and probably in the majority of instances, aneurisms are the consequence of a morbid affection of the whole arterial system. We may infer this from the disease frequently originating spontaneously, without any assignable local cause; and from frequently finding, in aneurismal sub- jects, various arteries studded with white, cartilaginous, or osseous specks. The false aneurism is always owing to an aperture in an artery, from which the blood gushes into the cellular sub- stance, in the manner already explained. A sadden and violent strain may lacerate an artery, and cause this dis- ease; or a wound may give rise to it. The false aneurism most frequently occurs at the bend of the arm, in conse- quence of the brachial artery being accidentally wounded in phlebotomy. When the artery is thus wounded the surgeon endea- vours to stop the hemorrhage by pressure, which may oc- casion a diffused aneurism, in consequence ot the external aperture being closed, so that the blood can ho longer escape, and must necessarily insinuate itself into the cellu- lar substance. The swelling thus created is uneven, more or less prominent, and extends upward and downward along the course of the artery. The skin covering it is of a dark purple colour. bud) is the origin of the diffused false aneurism. It in- creases in size, as long as the internal bleeding continues ;

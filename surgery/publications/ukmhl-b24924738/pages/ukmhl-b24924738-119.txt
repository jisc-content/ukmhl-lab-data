PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 67 There are further reasons for preferring amputation to an attempt to preserve limbs that have been severely shat- tered by gunshot wounds. 1. By the operation the patient gets rid of a dreacful contused wound, which threatens the greatest peril to his very existence, and exchanges it for a simple incised wound. g„ The pain of the operation is not, upon the whole, a greater severity than the aggregate pain arising irom the inflammation, irritation of extraneous bodies, and incisions for their evacuation and that of matter, in cases where the effort is made to preserve the limb. 3. The loss of the limb ought not to be taken into the scale ; for the surgeon only amputates on the principle of/ saving the patient’s life by that privation, Y, hen life is at stake, and it is more likely to be saved by the operation than both life and the limb together without the operation, it is our duty to amputate. By this maxim, no doubt, a small proportion oi limbs that might lie preserved will be sacrificed, but the patient’s life will be more frequently saved. Limbs that are saved after such dreadful injuries, arc also very often not more useful than a wooden leg ; and the vigour of the constitution is oftentimes irrecover- ably lost for a limb that is rather a burden than a conve- nience. rilli DILATATION OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS BY INCISION, AND EXTRACTION OF FOREIGN BODIES, CONSIDERED. When amputation is not deemed necessary, the surgeon, according to the customary precepts., is to enlarge the aper- ture of the w ound by an incision. Numerous advantages have been said to result from such a dilatation- It has been said to facilitate the extraction of foreign bodies, to occasion a beneficial effusion of blood, and to promote the escape of fluids extravasated into the surrounding cellular substance. Dilating the wound by au incision has been

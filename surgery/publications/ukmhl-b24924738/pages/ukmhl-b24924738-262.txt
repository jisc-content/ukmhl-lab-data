FIRST LINES OF TI1E 216 the disease. If the hernia cerebri were free from urgent, symptoms, perhaps the surgeon acts rightly who interferes Mith it as little as possible. The patient ought certainly to be-very freely bled/just as if the case were an apo- plexy. If there were urgent symptoms of great pressure on the brain, the surgeon would be warranted to -remove the surface ol the tumour, and endeavour to expose the in- ternal bleeding vessels, to try to put a stop to mischief, which, if left to itself, would certainly soon prove fatal.

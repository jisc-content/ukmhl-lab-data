2)0 FIRST LINES OF THE considerable pain, which is immensely increased when the surgeon moves the limb in order to examine the case. The head of the dislocated bone may sometimes be distinctly felt, forming a preternatural tumour or projection, while in the situation ot the articular cavity there is an unusual de- pression, or want of fulness in appearance. I he symptoms, however, of particular dislocations are not a proper subject for present consideration. Luxations are produced by external violence, which rup- tures such ligaments as naturally restrain the dislocated heads of the bones from being thrown into the particular directions in which, in various cases, they are found si- tuated. Even tendons proceeding over the surface of the joints are frequently lacerated. f he degree ot danger, in cases of luxations, is very much altered by the circumstance of the case being a sim- ple or a compound one. Simple dislocations, when re- cent, may commonly be reduced with facility/ and they cannot be reckoned at all dangerous cases. Compound dislocations of large joints, on the other hand, are, like compound fractures, frequently attended with danger; and the same nicety of judgment is requisitein determining whether amputation ought to be immediately performed, or an effort made to preserve the limb, as in cases of com- pound fractures. Most, of the remarks contained in the preceding chapter are equally applicable here. The de- gree of violence and laceration done to the soft parts, the great or little chance of healing the wound by the first in- tention, and the youth or advanced age of the patient, are circumstances which ought to influence the judgment in this difficult part of surgery. In the country also many cases would recover, which in town would not do so with- out amputation. The indications, in the treatment of dislocations, are to reduce the displaced articular surface as speedily as possi- ble, and to support the joint with bandages, or splints,

Under this treatment the acute stage of the ophthalmy commonly ceases in four or five days. The patient no longer complains of that oppressive sense of heat, weight, tension, and throbbing, experienced at first, and bears a moderate light without such a profuse evacuation of tears as w as produced by this cause before. At this period, how red soever the conjunctiva may ap- pear, it is no longer affected with acute inflammation ; and the ophthalmy has relapsed, from its inflammatory stage, into one comparatively chronic, attended with weakness and relaxation of the vessels of the conjunctiva, and mem- branous lining of the eyelids.

When bleeding and evacuations have been put into prac- tice, the next most useful measure is to apply a blister to the temple, or nape of the neck. At first, emollient applications arc the most beneficial,

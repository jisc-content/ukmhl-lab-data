PRACTICE OF SURGERY: 27 where the bones are covered with little flesh, and, conse- quently, where the external pressure has most effect. Sloughs, produced in this way, frequently occur over the trochanter major, os sacrum, os ilium, scapula?, &c. The part affected becomes soft, lead-coloured, red at the cir- cumference, oedematous, and, at last, black and senseless. Violent concussions and contusions ; the application of heat, and long-continued cold; very otten occasion sloughing. ilut, tiie attention of the reader is particularly requested to a peculiar sort of mortification, beginning at the ex- tremity of one, or more of thcsmall toes, and passing on to the foot and ancle, and, sometimes, to a part of the leg, quite u 11 preceded by any appearance of inflammation. In some few instances, it makes its appearance with little or no pain ; but, commonly, the patient feels great unea- siness through the whole foot and ancle-joint, particularly in the night time, even before the parts show any marks of distemper, or while there is only a small discoloured spot on the end of one of the little toes. From this spot the cuticle is always detached, and the skin underneath is of a dark red colour. Sometimes it is slow in spreading from toe to toe. At other times its progress is rapid, and horridly painful. It is most frequent in males, and is more often met with in the rich and voluptuous than in the labouring poor. It frequently happens to persons ad- vanced in life ; but it is by no means peculiar to old age. It is said to happen often in persons subject to gouty pains in the feet, without having regular paroxysms of the disorder. Few mortifications proceed so slowly as that now described ; it spreads, however, more quickly when it invades fleshy parts. Mortification appears, sometimes, to d pend on epide- mic causes. Instances have been known of almost all the ulcers and wounds in large hospitals, becoming simulta- neously affected with gangrene.

XXVII. 01' SCIRRHUS, OR CANCER, PREVIOUS TO ULCERATION. A HARD and painful glandular swelling, having a disposition to become cancer, says Richter, is the common, but inadequate and erroneous definition of scirrhus. The disease is not regularly attended with swelling; sometimes scirrhous parts diminish in size, and shrink. Hardness is not a characteristic property; for many tumours, which are not scirrhous, are exceedingly indurated. The disease is not always situated in a gland: it oftentimes attacks structures, which cannot be called glandular: and hard glandular swellings are often seen, which do not partake of the nature of scirrhus. The disposition to cancer cannot be enumerated among the marks of scirrhus, since it is not discoverable till carcinoma has actually commenced. Its termination in open cancer is not an invariable occur- rence; and other tumours become cancerous, to which no one would apply the term scirrhus. We cannot but admire the discrimination with which Richter views this part of an abstruse pathological sub- ject. We retire from the page, however, with unsatisfac- tory information; for instead of learning what peculiar features characterize scirrhus, we only collect that certain symptoms sometimes attend it, sometimes do not attend it, and sometimes attend other diseases, so that they form no di- agnostic criterion of the particular one under consideration.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. OJJ far within the abdomen, the nature of the case does not manifest itself till an extravasation happens. , The surgeon nlay adopt three different lines of conduct in the treatment of a wounded or mortified intestine. J. He may endeavour to unite the breach of continuity in the bowel by a suture. 2. He may endeavour to form an ar- tificial anus. 3. Lastly, lie may only employ general means, and trust the rest to nature. The circumstances that ought to determine the choice are our next consideration. Vv hen lire wounded part ot the bowel is protruded, the suture is to be made use ot before the partHs reduced. . ^ When the wound of the intestine is situated within the' cavity of the abdomen, a suture is impracticable^ and ex- cept general means to avert inflammation, nothing can be done. â€™/ / The true object of applying a suture to a wounded intes- tine, is not to procure an union of the edges ot the wound to each other, by making them touch at every point; nor is it designed to prevent the escape of air, and intestinal matter, from the cavity of the bowel into the bag of the peritoneum. The thin, moveable membranous edges the wound of the bowel would render such aims quite nu- gatory, unless such numerous stitches were''employed, as *. might, themselves prove the cause of sloughing, rather than the means of promoting a permanent cicatrization of the intestinal wound. A breach of continuity in an intestine is never repaired by the growth of the opposite edges of the wound to each other. The inflammation that regularly ensues, occasions an adhesion of the ad jacent viscera to the wounded portion of intestine, and thus the breach in it becomes closed. The only true object of applying a su- ture to a wounded bowel, is to confine the injured part - closely behind the external wound by means of the liga* ' lures, in order that any extravasated matter may find its A A

FIRST LINES OF THE 76 ctl^es would render it impracticable ; and were it possible, the confined and compressed state necessary to maintain these edges perpetually in contact, would greatly aggra- >a(e (lie unavoidable ill effects of the ensuing inflamma- tion. It is only meant to represent the propriety of not leaving many wounds with their edges very distant asun- der ; and (o recommend the practice of applying, here and theie, a strip of adhesive plaster, that their cavities may not be so extensive and exposed. Until the edges and surface of these wounds assume a clean appearance, no application is so proper as ag emollient poultice. When all the sloughs have separated, and the secretion of healthy pus lias commenced, dry lint, or a pledget of sim- ple ointment, is all that is requisite. CHAP. XVIII. OF GRANULATIONS AND CICATRIZATION; GRANULATIONS are formed by an exudation of the Coagulating lymph from the vessels of the wounded or ex- posed surface. Into this substance, it is probable, both the old vessels extend, and in it new ones are formed, so â€¢* that granulations become very vascular. The vessels of granulations pass from the original parts beneath to their bases, and thence towards their external surface, in almost parallel lines. Granulations have the same disposition to secrete pus as the'surface from which they were produced. The surfaces of granulations are very convex, having a great many points, or small eminences, so as to appear rough. The smaller these points are, the more healthy we find the granulations, The colour of healthy granulations

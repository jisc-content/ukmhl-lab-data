CIIAP. XLV AMPUTATION OF TIIE PENIS. IT is very generally set down, in surgical books, that cancer, and mortification of the penis, aieihe two causes, for which this operation is required. That the first is fre- quently a proper reason for amputating the penis, no man can question; but that mortification is so, every reflecting surgeon will deny. The mortified part will separate, and the living surface cicatrize afterwards, fully as well, as if the patient were to submit to a painful operation. When the case is a scirrhous, or cancerous disease, the prospect of a perfect cure will greatly depend upon the testicles, and glands hi the groin, being free from indura- tion. I have never seen this operation performed, except once, and, in that instance, the disease had extended to the testicles and inguinal glands, so that though the patient had got rid of (lie disease situated on the penis, the disor- der continued to increase in the groin and scrotum until life was exhausted. The operation is an extremely simple one. The surgeon commences by making an incision through the skin, all round that part of the penis, at which it is judged most advisable to amputate the part. The skin is then to be drawn a little towards the pubis, and exactly at its margin the operator is to make a complete division of the corpora cavernosa, and rest of the penis.

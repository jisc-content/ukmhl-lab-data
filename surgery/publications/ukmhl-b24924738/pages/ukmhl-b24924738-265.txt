PRACTICE OF SURGERY. constant dribbling of the saliva over the adjacent parts is, at least a very vexatious annoyance. A wound, or abscess, penetrating either the paro ..land or duct, is the cause of the malady. In the firs case, the fistulous opening is close to the ear; m the second it is situated on tlie cheek. When the parotid duct is recently wounded, an attemp mrv rationally be made to unite the Â» ound by the first m- tention^in the expectation that one end of the duct rtself may, at the same time, coalesce with the other. Butw en the wound has existed a good while, the latter hope would be vain; for the part of the parotid duct, on the side oi the wound most remote from the gland, soon contracts, and becomes obliterated, when the saliva ceases to flow through it in the usual manner. The plan next most commonly pursued, is to apply a graduated compress to the fistulous aperture. In this manner fistula of the parotid gland itself may generally be very expeditiously cured. But where the fistula pro* ceeds from the duct, the method is seldom proper; for the pressure prevents the excretion of the saliva, when it is se- creted, so that its accumulation gives rise to a painful and cedemalous enlargement of the gland, extending a consi- derable way down the neck. Thus it becomes necessary to remove the compress. Pressure does, however, sometimes succeed. The application of caustic to the fistulous aperture is another means. This is practised with a view of produ- cing an eschar sufficient to close Ihe opening, and prevent the issue of the saliva. To make the slough continue un- detached long enough for the fistula to heal underneath, it is recommended to bathe it frequently with brandy, or strong astringents. This plan cannot succeed unless the outward aperture be very small, and the saliva have some other fistulous channel for escaping into the mouth. Efforts haye been made to re-establish the obliterated

54 FIRST LINES OF THE In order that the noose may not rise above the mouth of the artery, the ligature must be drawn as horizontally as possible, and this is best fulfilled by the thumbs instead of the fingers. A knot is next to be made. When the wounded artery is large, one ligature to its upper orifice will not suffice ; for, as soon as this is tied, the blood finds its way, through anastomosing branches, into the lower part ofthe artery, and the lower orifice then begins to bleed. When a /arge artery is only punctured, and not cut through, a ligature is to be passed under it by means of an aneurism needle, the vessel being first exposed by an incision. â€ž As ligatures act as extraneous substances, and only omhalf of each is necessary for withdrawing it, when it is detached, the other is always to be cut off near the knot. Ligatures usually come away, even from the larger arteries that are tied, in about a fortnight. When they continue attached much beyond the usual period, it is proper to draw' them gently every time the wound is dressed, so as to accelerate their separation. 3. COMPRESSION. This is executed by applying a bandage and compresses, in such a manner that they mechanically stop the effu- sion of blood. Formerly surgeons used to fill the cavities of wounds with charpie, and then make pressure on the bleeding vessels, by applying a tight roller over the part. Tire moderns understand too well the utility of not allowing any extraneous substance to intervene be- tween the .opposite surfaces of a recent wound, to per- sist in the above plan, except in a few instances. They know that the sides of the wound may be brought into contact, and that compression may yet be adopt- ed, so as both to restrain particular hemorrhages, and

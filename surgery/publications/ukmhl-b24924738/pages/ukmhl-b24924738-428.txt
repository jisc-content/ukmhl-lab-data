FIRST LINES OF TIIE 3S6 CONGENITAL HERNIA. In this case the intestine, or omentum, is situated in contact â– with the testicle, and consequently in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, which forms, as it were, the hernial sac. The occurrence of this particular hernia arises from the change of situation, which the testis undergoes in the foetal state. This part, originally formed and situated in the loins, descends into the scrotum about the eighth or ninth month. The bag-, which is destined to make the future tunica vaginalis, is a production of peritoneum, situated in the groin under the integuments, and in the foetus always has an open communication with the abdomen. After the descent of the .testis, the opening through which it passed becomes closed and obliterated. But occasionally this cir- cumstance is hindered from taking place by the intrusion of a piece ol intestine, or omentum into the tunica vagi- nalis. In the congenital hernia the testicle cannot be distinctly felt on the outside of the tumour, at its inferior and poste- rior part, as it can in other cases. In this instance it lies in the same cavity in which the protruded viscera are situated, and consequently can only be felt in a very obscure manner. The tunica vaginalis also frequently contains at the same time a fluid, so that a fluctuation is perceptible, and the disease is liable to be mistaken for a hydrocele. Mr. Astley Cooper states, that this complication may be ascertained by returning all the contents of the tumour into the cavity of the abdomen, when the patient is in a horizontal posture, and then on putting the finger against the abdominal ring, the water will insinuate itself into the scrotum, so as to produce a kind of hydrocele. If the pressure of the finger is now di- minished, and the patient is desired to cough, the intestine and omentum will be felt falling down into their former situation.

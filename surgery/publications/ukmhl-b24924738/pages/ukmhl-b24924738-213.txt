PRACTICE OF SURGEEA. 179 "ays ligUt to persevere in £ *^r" w'- br S^S’SL^u’potent medi- ^ "oases, where the bub. has heaMra^ mercury should be given for a fortmght, or hr«w after thedisease in the groin is quite well. It is impossl to lay down any unexceptionable rules in these cases. Sometimes the sores produced by buboes assume an ^ conditioned appearance, even when they are os g, quite deprived of the venereal disposition. We are no always to set down the backwardness of a bubo to heal, as a mark of the presence of the original disease. The derail, ment, produced in the system by a course of mercury, is frequently a cause why syphilitic buboes are gradu Ily converted into phagedenic ones, or such as nil not cica- trize. In scrophulous constitutions the irritation of nereal matter in its passage through an absorbent ghind frequently gives rise to a scrophulous enlargement of the o-roin, and this disease will not be made to heal by the in- fluence of mercury ; on the contrary, if the system should have already suffered much from a mercurial course, per- severance in this treatment will change the usual indolence of a scrophulous abscess and ulcer, into a very foul, spread- ing, ill-conditioned local disease. Bark, sea-bathing, pure air, and the internal and ex- ternal use of hemlock, are highly serviceable in such cases. LUES VENEREA. A chancre, or a bubo, may occur without the general sys- tem being at all contaminated; but when the virus has been conveyed into the circulation, the whole constitution is, as it were, impregnated with the syphilitic poison, and lues venerea is said then to have taken place.

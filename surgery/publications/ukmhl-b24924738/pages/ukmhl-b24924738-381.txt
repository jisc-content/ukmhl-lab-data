PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 339 The operation being finished, the skin of the wound uf to be relaxed, and the edges brought together with adlA Sivc plaster. Compresses and a bandage should next â–  applied. If a breast has been removed, the arm on tft same side should be kept perfectly quiet in a sling until tft wound is healed. CHAP. XXXI. WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN ARE divisible into such as penetrate that cavity; and into others which only interest its parietes. The former differ very much in their nature, according as they do or do not injure parts of importance contained in the abdo- men. The latter are not very different from the generality of other superficial wounds. To lower inflammation, and to prevent collections of matter, are the chief indications ne- cessary to be observed in the treatment. There are, how- , ever, a few particularities in superficial wounds of the ab- domen claiming notice. SUPERFICIAL WOUNDS. All authors, From the remotest antiquity, have recorded, that wounds of tendinous parts are more dangerous than those of fleshy ones. Almost the whole front of the abdo- men is covered with tendinous expansions ; and hence it is not uncommon tcrobserve wounds in this situation followed by great local inflammation, which ends in the formation of abscesses. The constitution is, at the same time, dis- turbed with sympathetic fever. As the tension of the ab- domen subsides, rigots occur, from which we have ground to suspect that suppuration is about to take place. z 2

180 FIRST LINES OF THE quenco bf fins diffusion of tlie virus through the system, consists of the skin, tonsils, nose, throat, inside of the mouth, and sometimes the tongue* I he second order of parts, or those becoming affected in the latter stage of lues venerea, comprehends the perios- teum, fasciae, and bones. V'E.VERBA L ERUPTIONS. At first the skin is generally mottfed with discoloura- t ions in every part of the body, no part being more suscep- ^tiole than another. Many at these discolourations disap- pear, while, others continue, and increase with the disease. In Other instances, there are distinct blotches, often not observed till the scurfs are forming. In'some cases the eruptions come out in the form of small distinct inflamma- tions, containing matter, and resembling pimples : but not so pyramidicu!, nor so red at the base. Venereal blotches are often attended with a degree of transparency, particularly in warm weather. The degree of inflammation, first attendant on the eruption, soon goes off, and Hie cuticle peels off in the form of a scurf. A copper-coloured dry inelastic cuticle forms ; this is thrown off and a new scurf of the same kind is regenerated. These appearances spread to the breadth of a sixpence but seldom more extensively, at least for a considerable time. Every succeeding scurf becomes thicker and thicker, fill at last it becomes a common scab, and matter forms in the cutis beneath, so that at last the blotch becomes a true ulcer, which usually spreads, although in a slow manner. ^ ..•■..ft'. VE.VEilEAIi SORE THROAT. In the throat, tonsils, and inside of the mouth, lues ve- nerea generally makes its appearance as an ulcer, without much previous swelling. Common inflammation of the tonsils often suppurates in the centre, so as to form an ab-

ACTUAL CAUTERY. The application of a heated iron to a bleeding vessel is ©ne of the most ancient modes of suppressing hemorrhage, but at present i( is almost in general disuse. It operates by producing a slough, which covers and closes the mouth of "the artery. In order that it may not injure the circumja- cent part it is applied through a canula. • There are several formidable objections to its employ- ment. It does not regularly produce a permanent cessa- tion of hemorrhage, as when the eschar separates prema- turely the bleeding recurs. To many patients the proposal is attended with horror ; to all the application is severely painful. The only cases in which the actual cautery is at all jus- tifiable in modern practice, are hemorrhages situated in the mouth. 6. POTENTIAL CAUTERY, OR CAUSTICS. The most common, formerly used, was a button of blue vjtriol, of the size of a pea, rolled up in a piece of linen, and placed on the aperture of the bleeding vessel. Its ope-* ration is similar to that of heated irons. Caustics arc even worse than the actual cautery ; for their action is more te- dious, less effectual, and not confined to the vessel alone. 7. STYPTIC'S. Styptics are substances which have the property of pro- ducing a contraction of the.vessels ; and, as some suppose, coagulation of the blood.

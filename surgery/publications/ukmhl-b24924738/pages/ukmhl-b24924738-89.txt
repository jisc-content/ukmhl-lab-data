Such are the objections to compression. 4. AGARIC. Agaric formerly acquired immense reputation for having the virtue of stopping the most violent hemorrhage, with- out creating the least irritation. It has, however, no spe- cific property of checking bleeding ; and whatever good effects it may seem to have had are more properly ascrib- able to the compression adopted in conjunction with its use. If it have any virtue at all, this is a mechanical one, arising from its soft, spongy texture, which qualifies it for filling up all inequalities in the wound, and thus closing the vessels. When we consider that agaric is intended to be applied to the mouth of the bleeding vessel; and that, in this plan, the opposite surfaces of the wound cannot be brought into contact, we shall feel inclined to select some other means, not quite so repugnant to the union of the wound. Compression is often tried, because the vessel cannot be tied without having recourse to an operation in order to expose it. But the employment of agaric is war- ranted by no such reason ; for its supposed specific virtues require its application to be made directly to the divided artery. Agaric has also the inconvenience of acting as an extraneous substance in the wound, and, like compresses, it is liable to slip off the precise situation which it ought to occupy. Vv lien the wounded vessel is large, always prefer the li- gature to agaric : when smaller vessels bleed, compression is far preferable to this vainly extolled substance. These observations on agaric are also applicable to sponge. Therejrre cases, however, in which it is impos- sible to tie, or compress the bleeding vessel; and improper to employ means which remain to be described. In bleed-

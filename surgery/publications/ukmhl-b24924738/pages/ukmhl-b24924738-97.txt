PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 65 interrupted suture. The curvature of the needle employed should form a segment of a regular circle. When the needle is so shaped QS&to be curved towards its point, and straight towards its eye, it is obvious that it is not advantageously con- structed for passing through parts with facility. It should be double-edged for one-third of its length from the point, and its broadest part should te somewhat broader than the ligature, in order that the latter may tra- verse the wound with the utmost ease. When the bleeding has been suppressed, and all ex- traneous substances have been removed, the surgeon is to place the limb in such a posture as shall enable him to bring the lips of the wound easily into contact. The needle, armed with a ligature, is then to be introduced into the right lip of the wound, at a small distance from its edge, and is to be directed across the bottom of the wound, so as to come through the left lip from within outward. The needle is then to be cut off, and the ligature tied in a bow. These sutures should never be placed nearer toge- ther than an inch. Strips of adhesive plaster,and a band- a,re, are commonly employed at the same time. ,o Â» QUIT.LED SUTURE, So called from a quill being formerly used in making it. This means of uniting wounds has been occasionally prac- tised, when the muscles have been deeply wounded, and it was employed on the supposition, that it produces a more perfect support of every part of a wound than the preceding suture. The same kind of needle is used as for the interrupted suture ; but, it must be armed with a dou- ble ligature. When double ligatures have been intro- duced through the lips of the wound, at as many places as the length of the vround may require, their ends are to be separated, and then tied *in a bow over a piece of F

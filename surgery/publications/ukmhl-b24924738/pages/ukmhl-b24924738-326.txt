288 first lines of the light, which makes the pupil contract over the thin cir- cumference of the lens. . different kinds of cataracts. When the opaque lens is either more indurated than in re natural state, or retains a moderate degree of consist, once, the case is termed a firm, or hard cataract. Mr. Pott as ^plained, in lus usual elegant style, that an opaque ns is very rarely firmer than, or even so firm as, a healthy one; and bot li I Ins eminent surgeon and Richter make it ap- pear probable that the harder-a cataract is, the thinner and smaller it becomes. The latter slat*, that a/m cataract nsua y presents cither an ash-colonred, a yellow, or a broumish appearance. The interspace between the cala- ract and pupil is very considerable. The patient very dis- tinclly discerns the light, and can even plainly perceive urge bright objects. In the dilated state of the pupil, a block circle, surrounding the lens, is very perceptible. The motions ol the pupil are free and prompt; and the anterior surface of the cataract appears flat, without the least degree of convexity. When the substance of the lens seems to be converted into a whitish, or other kind of fluid, lodged in the cap- sule, the case is denominated a milky, or fluid cataract. - ccording to Richter, this species of the malady has usually a white appearance, while irregular spots and streaks, different in colour from the rest of the cataract, are often observable on it. These arc apt to change their Jgurc and situation, when frequent and sudden motions of the eyes occur, or when these organs are rubbed or pressed. ie lower half of the pupil seems more opaque, fhanfhe ^ upper one. The crystalline lens, as it loses its firmness, commonly acquires an augmented size. Hence the fluid cataract is thick, and the opacity close behind the pupil. Sometimes one can { erceive no space between the cataract - and margin of the lens. In advanced cases the pupil is

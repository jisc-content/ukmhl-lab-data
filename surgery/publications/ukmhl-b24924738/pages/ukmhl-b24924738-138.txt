106 FIRST LINES OF THE lishment of tliis point is of tile highest importance, for it shews the absurdity of amputating the wounded part cn- â€¢ largmg the wound, and making it inflame bythcappHca- lion ofstimulating dressings. If certain constitutional means only avail in a limited, proport ion of cases; if only the same degree of success at- icnd the combined effect of removing the wounded part, and administering internal medicines ; we must infer, that t ie operation had no influence whatever, and, as causing superfluous pain, and the loss of a finger or limb, it ought not to have been undertaken. Whoever wjll take the trouble of reading such cases as have been brought forward to prove the efficacy of removing the part, or enlarging the wound, will easily perceive, that nothing more is proved than that the cure was accomplished in this way in a li- mited number of instances, and generally with the assist- ance of internal medicines; that, the proportion of suc- cess is not greater than when only constitutional means were adopted ; that though these operations probably do not considerably diminish the chance of preservation, ex- cept when a whole limb is amputated, yet there is no evi- dence of their being at all useful. The symptoms ot tetanus are of a spasmodic nature, and the remedies should therefore be antispasmodic. Opium is the piincipal one; but it must be given in unusually large doses, in the quantity ot at least a grain every two houis. It is curious, that although this medicine be given so liberally in these cases, it never produces any great propensity to sleep, nor any ill consequences. If the spasms abate, the opium must not be suddenly relinquished. Half an ounce of laudanum, in a clyster, has sometimes stopped the progress of the disorder. Opiate frictions may also be employed on the cheeks, temples, and neck, when the muscles about the jaw are chiefly affected, and oa the back in universal tetanus.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 303 should be kept open by something interposed between the teeth. The hemorrhage is the most troublesome circum- stance ; but we have instances related of the anterior half of the tongue being amputated, and of the bleeding being easily suppressed, either by ordinary styptics, or the actual cautery. 1 think a tolerably dextrous man might tie the mouth of an artery in this situation, with the assistance of two pair of forceps to draw theends of the ligature, when the noose has been put over the tenaculum, round the bleeding point. Certainly, cancerous diseases of the tongue may have advanced to such a degree, that an operation cannot be prudently undertaken. The bleeding would be a se- rious objection ; and the contaminated state of the adja- cent lymphatic glands, below the jaw, usually existing in this advanced state of the malady, would render a radical cure quite impracticable. t JhJâ€™fc Ajilh f>'.x v/ ' !aJ*~ ** ' * XX^r> i CHAP. XXII. DISEASES OF THE TONSILS AND UVULA. THE tonsils are very liable to inflame; and sometimes the swelling thus produced is so great as to obstruct deglu- tition and respiration in a very dangerous degree. Prompt succour is now very urgently required ; and relief is com- monly obtained by scarifying the enlarged tonsils, and promoting the bleeding by warm gargles. This operation may be done with an ordinary lancet, or with one contained in a sheath, and constructed so that its point can only be pushed out to a proper distance. Pha- ri/ngotomus is the name usually applied to this instrument. Abscesses in the tonsils are, also, to be opened, when the swelling causes considerable inconvenience.

451 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. CIIAP. XLIX. t â€¢ < PUNCTURING THE BLADDER. THIS operation ought not to be considered a very dan- gerous one. It is probable, that when death follows, it is generally owing to the puncture not having been made suf- ficiently soon. We can hardly suppose, that a small wound made in such parts, as are divided in the opera- tion, can often occasion the fatal termination of these cases. Hence, I think there can exist no rational doubt, that when such means, as seem best calculated for promoting the dis- charge of urine, have failed, after having had a fair trial, the operation of puncturing the bladder becomes immedi- ately as much indicated, as the division of the stricture in cases of strangulated herniae, when other means have not been productive of the object in view. Mr. Charles Bell states, that the fifth, sixth, and seventh days, from the commencement of the total obstruction, aie those on which the urine may escape from the bladder into the abdomen ; and, consequently, he recommends the ope- ration to be performed on the fourth day. I am decidedly of opinion, that when other means have been fakly tried, the puncture should not belong deferred, and the allowance of forty-eight hours for making trial of remedies, previously to the operation, seems to me amply sufficient. There are three situations, in which surgeons may make an opening into the bladder, viz. from the perineum, above the os pubis, and through the rectum. Of the first opera- tion I shall say nothing ; it is now almost exploded, and, I hope, will so n be entirely rejected from the practice of surgery. G G 2

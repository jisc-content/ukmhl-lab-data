FIRST LINES OF THE J 38 ki,Hl of tumour and his attention was called to the nature Of the disease, by a case in which a swelling, partaking of the above structure, and about as large as an orange, was removedfrom the front of the thigh. The wound seLed tl lrS. C 1SpÂ°Se(1 to lieaI5 but it degenerated afterwards into a malignant ulcer, which occasioned death in the course of two months. As this kind of tumour is gradually lost in the sur- rounding parts, which probably retain a disposition to as- sume a similar morbid alteration, Mr. Abernethy very ju- diciously recommends a more extensive removal of them, than was practised in the above example. Mr* Abernethy thinks this kind of sarcoma more malig- nant than the preceding species, but not so much so as the following are. 6. TUBERCULATED SARCOMA Consists of an aggregation of small, roundish tumours, of various sizes and colours, connected together by a kind of cellular substance. Mi. Abernethy has chiefly seen this disease in the lym- phatic glands of the neck. The tumours ulcerated, be- came painful incurable sores, and destroyed the patients. Tuberculated sarcoma is so terrible a disorder that it may be deemed a fatal one: fortunately it is uncommon. 7. MEDULLARY SARCOMA. This is commonly seen affecting the testis, and has been termed the soft cancer of that part. The tumour resem- bles the structure and appearance of the medullary sub- stance of the brain. The inguinal glands on each side become affected'with the same morbid change, in consequence of the diseased state of the testis, and acquire a very enormous size. The skin covering the disease in the groin gives way, and the most prominent of the enlarged glands inflame, and are

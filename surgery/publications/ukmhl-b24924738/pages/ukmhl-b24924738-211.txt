PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 477 the practitioner should discriminate syphilitic affections of this kind from other swellings in .lie groin arising from dit- ferent causes. Mr. H unter was of opinion, that common- ly only one gland is affected at the same tune, in conse- quence of the absorption of venereal matter, and, if tins be the case, we have one criterion, by which we may know howto distinguish a venereal bubo from other swellings. 'Venereal matter also affects the glands nearest the seat of absorption, and never those which are situated m the course of the iliac vessels, and higher up. The bubo commonly begins with a sense of pain, and a small hard tumour soon becomes perceptible. This in- creases like every other inflammation that has a tendency to suppurate, and, if not checked, advances to suppuration and ulceration, the progress of the matter to the skin being quick. Some few venereal buboes are slow in their progress, and Mr. Hunter suspected, that, in these instances, the inflam- matory process is retarded by mercury, or a scropliulous ' tendency. The true venereal bubo is usually confined to one gland, and does not become diffused before suppuration has taken place. It is rapid in its progress from inflammation to suppuration and ulceration. The quantity of matter that forms is copious, and the pain is very acute, ihe colour of the skin, affected with inflammation, is a florid red. The nature of an enlarged inguinal gland is always at- tended with more uncertainty, when the swelling has ori- ginated without being preceded by an ulcer on the geni- tals. .JBuboes, which are not venereal, are generally preceded, and attended with a slight fever, or as Mr. Hunter says, the common symptoms of a cold, and the swellings are usually indolent and slow in their progress. When more quick than common, they become more diffused than ve- nereal buboes, and affect more than one gland. In general. N

FIRST LINES OF THE' 174 produces a disposition to tlie disease in such parts as are susceptible of being affected ; that after the disposition is formed the disorder must follow, even though every atom of the poison be expelled from the system ; and that the number of parts affected depends on circumstances, which we cannot explain. Besides, substances, which might al- ter the nature of the poison out of the system, would pro- bably not have the same effect when introduced among the animal fluids. We know how to dissolve urinary cal- culi in the laboratory ; but we cannot accomplish this ob- ject while the stones, are in the bladders of living patients. It is not likely that the virus remains very long in thesys- tem; very probably it is expelled from the constitution, together with some of the excretions. The disease after- wards occurs in such parts as have acquired the venereal disposition, and these have the power of forming the sy- philitic poison. CHANCRES. Chancres signify sores, which result from the applica- tion of venereal matter to a part of the body ; and conse- quently they are generally situated on the genitals. Tha syphilitic matter, thus applied, produces its specific in- flammation and ulceration, attended with a secretion of pus, and the matter secreted partakes of the nature of the matter first applied. A chancre has commonly a thickened base ; and al- though the common inflammation sometimes spreads much further, the specific is confined to this spot. The preced- ing inflammation begins with an itching ; and if thcglans penis be the part affected, a small pimple, full of matter, forms, without much hardness or swelling. When the disease occurs on the prepuce, or fraenum, the effects of the inflammation are more extensive and visible. The itch- ing is gradually changed into paiiyrthe surface of the pre- puce is, in some cases, excoriated, and afterwards ulcerates;

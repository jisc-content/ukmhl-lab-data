12 first lines of the tioned the fever attendant on inflammation, and some par- ticular account of it is now proper. Its name is derived from its being as it were one of the symptoms of the local disorder, and the sympathy of the whole constitution for the disturbed state of a part. SYMPTOMS AND VARIETIES. The symptoms are: a frequent, strong, and full pulse; diminution of the secret ions ; a hot dry state of the skin ; scanty high-coloured urine ; dry furred tongue ; thirst; disturbance of the nervous system ; loss of appetite and sleep ; in some cases delirium. The effects of inflammation on the constitution are not simply proportioned to the quantity of inflammation; they are influenced as much by the nature of the parts in which it is situated, as by its extent. When muscles, cellular membrane, skin, &c. are in- flamed, the pulse is strong and full. If the inflammation be in tendinous, ligamentous, or bony parts, the stdmack sympathizes more, than when muscles, &c. are inflamed. The pulse is quicker, but has eo( so much fulness, and the blood, not being propelled so far into the small vessels, forsakes the skin. When inflammation is in vital parts, or such as sympa- thize with the stomach, there is great depression blended with the constitutional symptoms, the pulse is frequent and small, and the blood is not pushed into the mi- nute vessels. When the constitution is good, and parts not very es- sential to life are inflamed, the pulse becomes increased in strength and fulness. When the same parts are affected in weak irritable persons, and in women who lead seden- tary lives, the pulse is quick, hard, and small, at the com- mencement of the inflammation, just as if vital parts were concerned.

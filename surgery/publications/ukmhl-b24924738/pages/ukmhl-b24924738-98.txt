REJECTION OF SUTURES. In the present schools of surgery the use of sutures is not recommended as it was in former days. It is now known that, by the conjoined operation of position, adhesive plaster, and a bandage, almost all wounds arc capable of being united, as expeditiously and well as they could be, were sutures to be employed. Therefore, were it only to avoid superfluous pain, we ought to reprobate the practice in general. Did sutures, however, only create a little ad- ditional pain, and no other evil, still their employment would be justifiable, if they really possessed the power of rendering union by the first intention, a matter of greater certainty, in only a limited proportion of cases to which they are applied. In the cure of the harelip, and perhaps in large wounds, penetrating the abdomen, we must admit their utility. In the first case the incessant and unavoid- able motionof the part: and, in the second,the distention of the w ound, arising from the viscera, and the danger of their being protruded, are reasons which explain the advantage of sutures in these particular instances. But, in general, the promotion of union by the first intention, cannot be set forth as a valid argument in favour of sutures being commonly used. Inflammation, above a very moderate pitch, always destroys every prospect of this nature, and occasions the secretion of pus, instead of the exudation of coagulating lymph. Sutures have fallen into disrepute, principally because they tend to increase inflammation. The new wounds w hich they make, their irritation as ex- traneous bodies, the forcible manner in which they drag the living parts together, and their incapacity in general 5

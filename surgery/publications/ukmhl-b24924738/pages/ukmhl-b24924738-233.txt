Supiot is the most remarkable, which we have on record s her thigh bones were so pliable, that her feet might easily be laid on each side of her head ; almost every bone in her body was affected in the same way, so that before she died she had become deformed in a most extraordinary manner, and was two feet two inches shorter than she was originally, before being affected with the disease. This case may be considered quite beyond the reach of medical skill. fragilitas ossium. Mr. Gooch lias described an instance, in which the bones became unusually brittle, before the morbid flexibi- lity of them took place. RICKETS. Weak and particularly scrophulous children are sub- ject to this disorder, in which the bones, in conse- quence of a deficiency of lime in their structure, cannot bear the weight of the body, and become distorted. In infants, who are too young to walk, the action of the mus- cles is sufficient to make the bones, particularly those of the lower extremity, deviate from the natural figure. There are various mechanical contrivances sold in Lon- don for supporting rickety bones, and gradually restoring them to a straight figure. It is not necessary to offer here a description of any apparatus for the purpose. Bark, tonic medicines in general, and cold sea bathing, improve rickety children by strengthening the system ? for in pro- portion as this happens the phosphate of lime becomes se- creted in a more regular manner, and wish the aid of me- chanical contrivances, very great deformities are gradual- ly removed. In all the three abovementioned disorders, as there seems to be a want of earth in the texture of the bones, it has been proposed to give internally the phos* phate of lin^e.

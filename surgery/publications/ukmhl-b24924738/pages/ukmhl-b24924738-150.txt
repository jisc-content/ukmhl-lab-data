1,8 FIRST lines of the Polypi are very apt to grow again, especially when airy portion is left behind. LIGATURE. The extraction of nasal polypi being constantly attend- ed with hemorrhage, wliich is sometimes profuse, another more modern method of cure has been put into execution. This consists in tying the root of the tumour with a liga- ture, by which means the polypus is thrown into a state of inflammation, suppuration, and sphacelus ; and at length becomes detached. A silver wire is to be introduced through a double eanula, so as to form a noose at the up- per end of the instrument, proportioned in size to the ante- riour part of the tumour situated in the nostril. The two ends of the wire are to hang out of the two lower apertures of the double eanula, and one of them is to be fastened to a small ring on its own side of the instrument. The polypus is next to be taken hold of with forceps, and drawn a little out of the nose. The noose is then to be carried over the forceps and polypus into the nostril, care being taken to draw out the loose end of the wire gradually as the instrument is introduced further. Silver wire is more easily applied than any other kind of ligature, on ac- count of its elasticity. When the noose has been carried as far as possible over the polypus, the loose end of the wire is to be drawn out at the lower end of the eanula, and rolled round the little ring on that side of the instrument. Thus the proper degree of constriction on the root of the polypus may be produced. The wire must be tightened every day until the tumour has separated. The ligature is attended with so many difficulties, that the forceps are infinitely preferable in the majority of cases. Hemorrhage is the only inconvenience for which extraction is abandoned ; and this, as was before stated, is far less dangerous than is represented. The inconveniences of the

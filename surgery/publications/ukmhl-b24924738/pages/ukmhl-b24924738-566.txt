FIRST LINES OF THE 524 fracture, which is not displaced, is very difficult fo defect, and, no doubt, is very frequently never discovered. The surgeon should place his hand on the part where the pa- tient seems fo experience a pricking pain, or where the blow has been received ; and then the latter should be de- sired to cough, in which action the ribs must necessarily undergo a sudden motion, and a crepitus thereby be often rendered perceptible. However, all modern practical surgeons are in the habit of adopting the same treatment, w hen there is reason to suspect a rib fo be fractured, as if this were actually known to bathe case, by the occurrence of a crepitus, or by the projection of one end of the frac- ture, which, indeed, in instances which are displaced, makes the nature of the accident most conspicuous. When aspiculaof a fractured rib is beaten inward, we may easily perceive the reason, why very alarming symp- toms should frequently occur : extravasation of blood, emphysema, inflammation in the chest, &c. Excepting any particular urgent symptoms should arise, and whicli it is not my place to consider here, the treatment of fractured ribs is exceedingly simple. The object in view is to render the injured bone, or bones, during the cure, as motionless as possible. For this purpose a piece of soap plaster is to be applied to the situation of the fracture, and a broad roller is to be firmly put round the thorax. How- ever, as a roller is very apt to become slack, it is generally belter to get a piece of strong linen, sufficiently large to surround the chest. This cloth is then to be made to com- press the ribs, by being laced with proper tightness. Every person, in not a debilitated state, having a broken rib, or supposed to have such, should be bled as soon as the surgeon has applied a bandage. If a troublesome cough should afflict the patient, and disturb the fracture, the spermaceti mixture, with opium, should be exhibited.

402 FIRST LINES OF TIIE performing this easy task, it is proper to incline the edge of the knife towards the tumour, which, after the division of the cord, may be considered as dead, and destitute of sensation. If any artery in the cavity of the scrotum should bleed freely, it ought to belied before the wound is closed. The edges of the incision are to be brought together with sticking plaster; over which a pledget, compress, and the T bandage are to be applied.

CHAP. XXXIX. CIRCOCELE AND VARICOCELE. TlIE latter term implies nothing more than a preterna- tural dilatation of the blood vessels of the scrotum. These, like the Vessels in other parts of the body, are liable to be- come varicose; but they are seldom so much enlarged as to be troublesome, unless such enlargement is the conse- quence of a disease either of the testicle, or of the sperma- tic cord. In this circumstance, the original disease claims our attention, and not this simple effect of it; and there- fore, as Mr. Pott observes, the varicocele, considered ab- stractedly, is a disease of no importance.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 35 Copious bleeding, however, is generally hurtful, and no blood ought ever to be taken away when the abdominal viscera are much disordered. In severe erysipelas other evacuations are indispensable ; for it is usually connected with a derangement of the se- cretion of bile. Cremor tartari, natron vitriolatum, manna, and other mild purgatives, given with small doses of the antim. tar- tariz. are the best medicines in this sort of case. When the patient has a very foul tongue, a bitter taste in his mouth, and a propensity to vomit, if purgatives should not quite remove the symptoms of disorder in the viscera, an emetic becomes necessary. In fact, an emetic is indicated in every severe case, and ought even to be re- peated. When purgatives only produce a temporary abatement of the visceral disorders, the vitriolic acid proves bene- ficial. \ t LOCAL TREATMENT. Many surgeons decry both warm and cold moist appli- cations to erysipelas, and recommend keeping the part dry, and in a moderate equal warmth, secluded from the air. Such practitioners think, that a gentle diaphoresis from the inflamed part forms one principal indication, and, for this reason, they cover the local affect ion with flannel, or dry mealy powders. This doctrine is probably founded on prejudice. I have generally been in the habit of applying the same kind of topical applications, viz. cold lotions, both to erysipe- las and phlegmon, and I have never had reason to think them less efficacious in the former than in the latter case. Emollient poultices, however, should never be ap- plied ; for, they sometimes induce suppuration, which is- attended with serious consequences in these cases.

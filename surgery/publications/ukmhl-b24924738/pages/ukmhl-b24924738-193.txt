The par vagurn must be carefully excluded from the ligature, for to tic it would be a fatal error. CrV CHAP. XXX. \ VARICOSE VEINS. THE veins, as well as the arteries, are subject to a pre- ternatural dilatation, technically termed a varix. Any cause producing a long-continued turgescence of particular veins may in the end rentier them varicose. Thus the gravid uterus, by pressing on the iliac vessels, fre- quently gives rise to varicose veins in the lower extremity, and rectum, in which latter situation they are named piles. In the same way a depending position of a limb, long con- tinued, may cause the disorder. The superficial veins are most subject to become varicose, and the varix generally first occurs in the situation of a valve. At first the tumour is commonly circumscribed below, in which direction the disease seems to be bounded by the valve ; but as the case advances, the distention of the vein extends higher, and the varix loses its determinate figure, particularly at its upper part, and becomes more oblong. The contained blood is at first fluid, and the tu- mour is so soft as to yield readily to the touch*, but at a more advanced stage the blood coagulates, and the varix is then bard, and no longer recedes on pressure. Some- times a tolerably long portion of the vein is filled with co- agulated blood, which, when drawn out of the yessel, ap- pears like a worm.

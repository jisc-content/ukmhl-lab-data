130 FIRST LINES OF THE quire the power of forming a durable cicatrix, if the same relaxing treatment were to be continued. These weak un- healthy granulations, when stimulated by topical applica- tions, undergo a considerable change, becoming smaller, jnoic compact, redder, and free from their glossy appear- ance ; and the cicatrix, which follows, is more apt to con- tinue healed, than when the sores have been healed by re- laxing applications. Solutions of lunar caustic ; touching the surface of the ulcer with the caustic itself; diluted nitrous acid; the unguent, liydrarg. nitrat. ; and the unguent, hydrarg. ni- trat. rubr.; and supporting the sore and the neighbour in a- skin and muscles with a roller; are the best means w hich were used for healing common indolent ulcers, before Mr. Baynton laid before the public his very successful me- thod. This gentlemanâ€™s practice consists in applying strips of adhesive plaster round the limb, so as to cover the sore, and, at least, one inch of the parts both above and below the ulcer. The strips of plaster are to be two, or three, inches broad, and long enough to surround the limb, and leave an end about four inches long. The middle of the strip, so prepared, is to be applied to the sChnd part of the limb, opposite the inferior part of the ulcer, so that the lower edge of the plaster may be placed about an inch below the edge of the sore; and the ends are then to be drawn over the ulcer with as much gra- dual extension as the patient can well bear. As many strips are to be applied in this manner as will cover the whole surface of the sore, and one inch of the limb below and above it. Soft compresses are to ba laid over the part; and the limb from the foot to the ankle is to be rolled with calico bandages. The affected parts are then to be kept moist with cold

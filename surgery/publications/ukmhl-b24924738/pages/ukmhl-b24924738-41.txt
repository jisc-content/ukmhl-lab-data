The other manner in which inflammation ends is in Ihe death of the part affected. This is the worst, but hap- pily the least frequent result of common inflammation. Every psJrt just recovered from the violence of phlegm- onous and other kinds of inflammation, may be regarded as still imperfect. Its vessels seem to have become weak in proportion as they have been previously excited to extra- ordinary action, and every part affected with vascular weakness has a great tendency to fresh inflammation. Sometimes, in consequence of the loss of tone, induced in the vessels by the vehemence of acute inflammation, a languid or chronic inflammation succeeds, which it is very difficult to overcome ; hence, however improper stimu- lants, astringents, and corroborants may be, as local ap- plications, during the violence of phlegmonous inflamma- tion in many situations, they are generally highly proper the moment that stage ceases. Thus emollients, which for the first few days are serviceable in acute ophthalmy, act afterwards prejudicially, in consequence of their re- laxing nature. CHAP. II. SYMPTOMATIC INFLAMMATORY FEVER. i AFTER being informed that the mass of circulating blood becomes affected in cases of inflammation, we must expect to find traces of constitutional as well as of local disturbance. In fact, we have already repeatedly men-

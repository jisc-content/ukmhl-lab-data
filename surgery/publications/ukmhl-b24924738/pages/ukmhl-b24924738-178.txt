H4 FIRST lines of the Ollier tumours are commonly more moveable than scir- rhous ones, especially when they have not been inflamed. It we except the fungus hsemafodes, other tumours do not involve every kind of structure, skin, muscle, cellular substance, &c. and the integuments seldom become affected before the distension produced by the size of such swell- ing5 becomes very considerable. In scirrhous cases the skin soon becomes contaminated, discoloured, and puck- ered. Some few tumours may be harder and heavier than a few scirrhous ones ; but the reverse is commonly the case. As otkei indurations and tumours may assume the can- cerous action, and even end in cancerous ulceration ; and as some true scirrhi, when not irritated by improper treat- ment, may continue stationary for years; the occurrence of actual carcinoma cannot prove that the preceding state wa* that of scirrhus. The only criterion of the latter dis- ease which we possess, is deduced from the assemblage of characters already specified ; for except the peculiar puck- ering, and speedy leaden discolouration, of the skin, no other appearances, considered separately, form any line of discrimination. The most characteristic mark of a scirrhus is its struc- ture being intersected w ith white ligamentous bands, which often extend a good way into the surrounding fat. This texture cannot be detected till the disease has been re- moved. The fact corroborates the prudence of taking away a considerable portion of the substance surrounding a scirrhous tumour. Sometimes cysts, containing a transparent fluid, and supposed to be hydatids, are found in the substance of scirrhi; but they are not so frequently attendant on the complaint as to form any part of its character. The superficial veins are usually very much dilated. 4v. JV ...

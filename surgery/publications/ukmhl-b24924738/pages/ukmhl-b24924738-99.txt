PRACTICE Of SURGERY. " to accomplish any useful purpose, which position, adhesive plaster, and bandages, cannot effect, are strong motives .or reprobating their being commonly used. In fact, it often happens, when sutures are employed, that considerable inflammation of the wound is the consequence, and its swollen edges evince marks of suppuration, unless soon relieved from the irritation of the ligatures. In this case, if the surgeon lie sagacious enough to cut the liga- tures, and remove them in time, suppuration may still -often be avoided. Extensive erysipelatous redness, sur- rounding wounds, will often be found to originate from the irritation of sutures. Mr.Pibrac’s remarks on this subject, in the third vol. of lheMem.de l’Acad. deChir. are highly worthy of universal consideration. After relating many convincing facts, he concludes with asking, what practice the partisans of su- tures would adopt, were they necessitated, as they fre- quently are, to cut the ligatures, and remove them ? Or, were they to find, as is often the case, that the ligatures had made their way through the lips of the wound so ns 1<> leave them gaping ? They would then never think ol in- troducing new sutures, but would have recourse to a bandage in order to unite the wound. They who assert that the good effect of sutures is in many cases supported upon the solid basis of experience, ought to prove that the same effect could not be produced by the conjoined operation of a proper posture, adhesive plaster, and the pressure of bandages. Whoever wishes to investigate this subject further should peruse M. Louis’s Observations on the Fundamen- tal Principles of Union by the f irst Intention. This justly famous man proved, that even the harelip could be united very well without a suture. (Mem. de l’Acad’. dc Chit.)-

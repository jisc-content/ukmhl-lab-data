PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 435 next be carried forward in the same gentle manner, till it has got through the stricture. After this it should be im- mediately withdrawn by a very gentle motion to the part, at which it was first made to rest awhile. Then it should be passed very slowly through the stricture a second time , but without letting the bougie stop in its passage. I f pain or faintness arise, the operation is now to end, and the bou- gie be immediately withdrawn : but, if no such effects should be produced, the instrument may be passed, and Withdrawn, «nce or twice more, before concluding the ope- ration, which will occupy about two minutes. The application is to be repeated once every seven days, and, if the stricture be found dilated, the bougie must be proportionally increased in size every time. The piece ot caustic, in no cases whatever, ought to be larger than a common pin’s head. By the above procedure, Mr. Whately asserts, that the kali is equally diffused over every part of the slrictured surface, and only abrades the membrane ot the stricture, without producing a slough. Whoever wishes further information, concerning this method of treatment, must consult Mr. Whately’s publi- cation. Iu eases, in which the stricture occupies some extent, I should prefer common bougies ; and, when the contraction is such as would arise from tying a piece of packthread round the urethra, 1 should always prefer the bougies employed in Mr. Home’s method. OF A NEW PASSAGE. Mr. Hunter very justly informs us, that the greatest evil, arising from the improper use of the bougie, and the most dangerous, is the formation of a new passage. This is generally occasioned by an attempt to excite ulceration by the application of the end of the bougie to the stricture, when this instrument cannot be passed through it. Every lime a bougie is now introduced, it cannot be prevented f f l2

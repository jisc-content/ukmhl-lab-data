When the wound of an intestine is situated within the abdomen, remotely from the external wound, no uiun is practicable.[ 'The surgeon seldom knows, at first, that the bowel is injured ; for the matter extravasaied from its cavity does not appear at the wound ; and when the ex- travasation is afterwards discovered, it would be impossi- ble to get at the wound of the intestine, on account of the ia cxc erg^x^dhesion that soon forms. C- 'L.i' tc Even if the wound of the intestine were discovered on its first occurrence, no suture could be applied to it without fehlarging the external wound, searching for the wounded bowel, and drawing it out of the cavity of the abdomen. By these steps a wound, that might not previously have been dangerous, would very probably be converted into a mortal one. /hf When the wound of the intestine is first detected, on the occurrence of an extravasation a few days afterwards, the discharge of the effused fluid is the only thing to be done. A suture for the wound of the bowel is unnecessary, as the adhesive inflammation has already fixed the part in > its situation,' and the aperture in it is closed in the man- ner already explained. When the wound of the intestinal canal is situated in the abdomen, closely behind the inner wound, the em- ployment of a suture is also unnecessary, as the contents of the gut are discharged through the external aperture, and there is no reason to fear a diffusion of them among the viscera, if care be taken to keep the external wound open. There is also no cause to fear that the wounded bowel may i change its situation, and become distant from the outer wound. Nothing but violent motion of (he body could cause so unfavourable an accident, and this ought always to be avoided. The adhesions, which take place in the I

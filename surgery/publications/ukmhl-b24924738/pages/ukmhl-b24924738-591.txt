PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 547 ported by the head of the bone, the fulness of the shoul- der is lost. The head of the os brachii may be felt in the axilla, and the bone cannot be raised in a line with the acromioi^). When the luxation is backward, the elbow is very mnch inclined towards the fore part ot (lie thorax, from which posture it cannot be moved, without considerable pain. The pectoral muscle is in a state of tension, and the limb seems longer than is natural. This luxation is not so fre- quent as the next. When the os brachii is dislocated forward, the arm is very much shortened; the head of the bone may be felt forming a pi'otubeiance under the pectoral muscle: the forearm is somewhat bent; the elbow is thrown to a little distance from the side,' and cannot be placed near if, with- out) the patient experiencing tt good deal ot pain; the co- racoid process cannot be very easily fell; and the hollow, below the acromion, though Aery distinguishable, is not so manifest, as when the head of the bone is thrown downward into the axilla, or backward beneath the spine ot the sca- pula. When the head of the bone lodges in the axilla, its pressure on the nerves and large vein may occasion pa- ralysis, and oedema, of the limb. We may conclude, when the os brachii is dislocated for- ward, that the tendons of the muscle-, ot the scapula must often he ruptured. The best modern surgeons are of opinion, that none of the mechanical contrivances tor making extension, devised by the ancient*, are so eligible as a skilful employment of the power of the bands alone. The first object, in the treatment of a dislocation, is to dislo;!ge the head of the us bnifhii from the situation, which it occupies, in order to bring it on a level with the glenoid cavity of the scapula.

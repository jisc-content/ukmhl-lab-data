PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 251 The attempt to disperse encysted tumours of the eyelids generally fails; and as the operation of removing them wnli a knife is by no means serious, it is almost absurd to tam- per with the complaint. Scarpa is a strong advocate tor removing the generality of these tumours, by making the incision through-the luting of the eyelid._ One would con- ceive, that if the tumour were on the outside of the cartilage of the eyelid, the operation must be most easy, when me wound is made through the integuments of the part.

Fain and redness arc its chief diagnostic symptoms; the latter one is particularly so, the healthy eye being free from all redness. But this appearance is not essential to ophthal- my; for many eyes, undergoing vehement inflammation, are little, or not at all, fed. The internal ophthalmy is of this description. The red appearance, when present, is most evident in the white of the eye; but when ihe inflam- mation is severe, red vessels are frequently seen ramifying over the cornea. Little vesicles, containing extravasated blood, also, sometimes form on this transparent membrane. The dark red swelling of the conjunctiva, termed chemosis, arises from an effusion of blood into the loose cellular tex- ture, which connects this membrane with the sclerotica. The eyelids also commonly partake of the redness attend- ant on ophthalmy.

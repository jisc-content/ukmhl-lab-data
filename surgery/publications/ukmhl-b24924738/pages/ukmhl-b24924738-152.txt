*20 , first lines of the turally be only of small extent, as it only came into con* tact with a trivial portion of the polypus. The only cases in which it might be proper still to em- ploy the cautery, arc those in which the polypus is dis- posed to bleed profusely from the slightest causes, and in which the patient, owing to debility, cannot bear the further loss of blood. There are a few very uncommon cases, also, in which this plan might be practised instead of extraction, in consequence of the tumour having liga- mentous connections. In employing the cautery the object is not to effect by its direct agency the gradual destruction of the polypus, but to excite such an inflammation, suppuration, and mortifi- cation, of the whole of the excrescence as will lead to this event. A heated trocar is to be introduced through a ca- nula into the middle of the tumour. Injections into the nostril ought also, in this plan of treatment, to be repeat- edly made when the discharge commences. \ CUTTING INSTRUMENTS Have always been reprobated, because they usually occa- sion a profuse hemorrhage, and can hardly ever be passed far enough into the nose without doing mischief. Yet. there are instances'in which their use might be productive of advantage. The front of the polypus is sometimes so thick and hard, that it is utterly impossible to introduce the forceps for the performance of extraction, or the ca- nula for the application of the ligature. In such a case, it might be a judicious step to cut off the front of the po- lypus. Polypi of the mucous membrane of the nostrils, mere relaxation of that part, may be benefited by astringent in- jections, containing alum, muriate of ammonia, &c. Ex- traction is never applicable to them ; but when necessary, Â»nd the thing is possible, they may either be tied, or cut away.

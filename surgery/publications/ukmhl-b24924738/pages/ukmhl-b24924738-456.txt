FIRST LINES OF THE 414 fectious, and in consisting of a discharge, which is com- posed of globules, blended with the mucous secretion of the part. The discharge, in cases of gonorrhoea, on the other hand, has the power of infection, and is composed of globules, mixed with a serous fluid. TREATMENT. Stimulating injections may be tried. Two grains of the Itydrarg. mur., dissolved in eight ounces of distilled wa- ter, form a very suitable application. Injections fre- quently produce a temporary cessation of a gleet, and the complaint soon afterwards recurs. On this account pa- tients should not relinquish their use too soon, on the sup- position of their being permanently well. It is generally advantageous to continue to employ the injection two or three weeks, after the complete stoppage of the discharge. In some instances, sea water makes a more efficacious injec- tion, than any other. It Avas very common formerly to in- troduce bougies, medicated with turpentine or camphor, and about four or five inches long, into the urethra, Avitha view of irritating the lining of this canal, and altering the mode of action in the vessels. HoAvever, the practice has gone a good deal into disuse, and this is a strong test of its not having been productive of more, or e\en so much, effi- cacy as injections, which can be used Avith less trouble. At the same time that injections are employed, the sur- geon may direct the patient to fake thirty drops of the bal- sam. cop ah. thrice a day; or the tinct. catharid., begin- ning Avitli a dose of ten drops thrice a day. If these medi- cines produce no good, though taken regularly for a Aveek or ten days, they may be discontinued, as affording no hope of their becoming useful afterwards. Many gleets will not yield to the above plan of treat- ment. Patients, so circumstanced, may try cold bathing (if possible, in the sea), and rough horse exercise. If de- bilitated, they should take bark and steel internally. Elec-

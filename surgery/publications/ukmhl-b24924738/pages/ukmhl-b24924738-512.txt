When these fail, some benefit may be obtained from wear- ing the T bandage, with a piece of sponge, applied, as a compress, to the anus. It is to be observed, however, that though bandages keep up the bowel, a volvulus frequently follows their employment, and, as they are of necessity taken off, wheq the patient goes to stool, they present a very faint prospect of radically curing even the prolapsus am, as the bowel regularly descends, whenever there is a motion. The patient should be cautioned to prevent the descent of the gut with his finger, on this occasion ; but he cannot always hinder the event.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY, 4$1 gina. When such a circumstance occurs in female chil- dren, they may possibly lire, in. consequence of the great dilatation, of which their urethra is susceptible, and the vagina being a sufficiently capacious passage for the exit of the faeces. Male children, on the contrary, must ine- vitably perish. The first kind of imperforation is easily distinguishable. The child does not discharge the meconium; he makes great efforts, which, at last, are attended with convulsions. A membrane, of rather a transparent nature, is visible in the situation of the anus, and, through it, the colour of the meconium may be seen. In consequence of the continual efforts, which the infant makes, the membrane becomes mpre and more protruded, so as to form a tumour. When there is a very small opening, the fluid part of the meco- nium escapes; the child makes less considerable efforts; but these are sufficient to excite alarm. The defect is rea- dily detected by an examination. If the anus should be closed by a membrane, this should be divided by a crucial incision, and, if necessary, the an- gles may then be removed. The frequent evacuation of the intestinal matter will be quite sufficient to keep the opening pervious. When there is an aperture at the anus, but it is too nar- row, it is to be dilated, in the most convenient direction, by means of a crooked bistoury and a director. This case is not so simple as the former one; for the extremity of the rectum may be contracted, as well as the integuments. In this circumstance, the edges of the wound will be very prone to contract again, if not mechanically dilated, until a complete cicatrization has taken place. The whole of the sphincter ani may also be cut, and an inability to re- tain the fieces be the irremediable consequence. The second species of imperforated anus is very danger- ous, on many accounts; but, particularly, because very liable to be a long time unnoticed,, by reason of the exter-

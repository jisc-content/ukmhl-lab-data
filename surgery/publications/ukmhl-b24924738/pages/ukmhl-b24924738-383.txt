34* PRACTICE OF SURGERY. WOUNDS PENETRATING THE ABDOMEN WITH, AND WITH- OUT, INJURY OF THE VISCERA. A narrow, oblique wound may penetrate the cavity of the abdomen, without there being any mode of ascertaining easily whether it has done so, or not. This is ot no prac- tical importance ; for when there are no urgent symptoms evincing the nature of the case, the treatment ought ob« « viously to resemble that of a simple w ound. When a wound penetrating the abdomen is of sufficient size, the appearance of a portion of intestine, or of omen- tum in it, leaves no doubt that the peritoneum is divided. Profuse hemorrhage, from a wound ot the abdomen, is a ground for suspecting that some viscus of consequence is injured. There is no artery in the parietes of the abdo- men, except the epigastric, from which much blood can be effused, and it is easy to learn whether the hemorrhage proceeds from it. The escape of the contents of particular viscera some- times manifests what has happened. lint whether any appearance of this kind happens, must depend on the size and course of the wound. When there are no external marks, denoting what vis- cera are injured, the surgeon may always form a judgment from the symptoms which follow, and which are of two • kinds, general, and particular. The former consist of a small, feeble, contracted pulse ; pallid countenance; coldness of the extremities; great and sudden debility; hiccough; vomiting; spasm and tension of the abdomen. Such symptoms may, indeed, occur in irritable, timid subjects, without any important part being injured; but then they usually gooff vary soon. The particular symptoms evince what parts arc wound- ed. They arc, bloody urine, when the kidney's, or uri- nary bladder is wounded; vomiting of blood, when'the

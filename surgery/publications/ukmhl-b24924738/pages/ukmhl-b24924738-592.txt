548 FIRST LINES OF THE pose advantageously, proper extension must be made, while the bone itself should be made to operate as a lev?r in moving the head to any side, by having a long towel placed a little below the axilla, by means of which towel, skilfully pulled by an assistant, the necessary fulcrum may be formed. As soon as the head of the bone is brought opposite the glenoid cavity, the limb should be resigned to the action of the muscles, which draw the bone into its natural situa- tion. When the extension is made, it is necessary to fix the patientâ€™s body by placing a broad towel round the chest, and tying it to some very immoveable point. The clavi- cle and scapula are, also, to be kept back with the hand* of an assistant . The elbow is to be bent. The extending power should be applied a little above the con d v 1 oftheos brachii. The extension should be, at first, very gradual, and it should not be remitted till the object in view is accomplished. In this way the muscles of the most athletic man may be overcome ; while the most violent ' extension, not regularly maintained, will often fail. The part of the arm, round which the towel for making the chief extension is placed, should be defended by flannel. When the head of the bone has been so moved, that it seems likely to return into the gleuoid cavity, by the action of the muscles, the assistants, who are making the exten- sion, are to be directed to diminish it. On this being done, if the surgeon merely attend to keep the head of the bone on a level with the socket, the reduction spontane- ously follows. The arm is afterwards to be kept quietly in a sling, and a piece of soap plaster, and a spica bandage applied to the shoulder. Some surgeous use multiplied pulleys for mak- ing extension, and as far as my own experience extends, they answer the purpose extremely well. i

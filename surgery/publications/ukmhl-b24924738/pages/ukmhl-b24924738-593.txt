I PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 549 DISLOCATION OF THE ELBOW. The forearm cannot be thrown forward without a frac- ture of the olecranon. The most frequent dislocation at this part consists in the ulna being pushed into the place of the radius, on the lower end of the humerus. The form of the bones is almost an insurmountable obstacle to a dis- location inward. From the perusal of books one mi;’ suppose, dislocations at the elbow were so obviou , hr.; n« mac, however deficient in talents and attention, could possibly fall into error. This is far from being true; for accidents of this kind are commonly productive of so rapid and con- siderable a degree of swelling, that the form of the joint is yery much obscured. When Ike ulna is pushed into the situation of the ra- dius, the space between the olecranon and internal con- dyle, is much greater than is natural. These points of bone are always very distinguishable let the joint be ever so much swollen, and hence the information, to be derived from an examination of them, may be obtained in every case, without exception. When the ulna is pushed into the place of the radius, the latter bone cannot be easily rotated, nor can the forearm be bent, and extended in a perfect manner. Sometimes the radius is driven forwards, and the ulna backwards, the coronoid process of the latter bone being generally at the same time fractured. Dislocations of the elbow joint are easily reduced, as soon as the necessary extension is made. The arm should afterwards be kept in a sling, and the inflammation of the joint should be averted, by keepingthe part constantly surrounded with linen, wet with the saturnine lotion. DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST. These cases are particularly obvious to the most super-

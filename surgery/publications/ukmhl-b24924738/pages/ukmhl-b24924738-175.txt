Hence it will continue to en- - large, unless checked by surgical applications, or removed by the knife. TREATMENT OF SARCOMATOUS TUMOURS. The growth of all indolent tumours may be retarded by repeated topical bleeding, and the application of linen wet with the aq. litharg. acet. If the enlargement ot a swelling be completely stopped in this manner, the next ooject is to promote the absorp- tion of the new-formed substance. Mercurial frictions, electricity, blisters, and stimulating topical remedies, are proper for this purpose; but the attempt generally fails, because if you stimulate a tumour too much it is apt to slough, and leave a dangerous, extensive, and frequently malignant, sore; and if you do not stimulate so much, still the irritation employed often renews the increased ac- tion, checked by the first kind of remedies, and the tumour begins to enlarge again. For these reasons, the practice of trying to disperse in- dolent tumours is not deserving of much praise. The re- moval of the disease by the knife is the best measure, and the sooner this is done the better ; for a common adipose tumour, now about the size of an apple, and capable oi being extirpated with the utmost safety, may in the course of a few years become so large as to weigh near fifteen pounds; and the magnitude of the wound necessarily made in cutting out so large a mass would be very peril- ous. Besides, sarcomatous tumours, when removed in an early state, are not so apt to leave the surface of the wound in a morbid condition. When the tumour is known, at the time of the opera- tion, to be either a mammary, a tuberculated, or medul- lary, sarcoma, care should be taken to make a free removal of the surrounding substance.

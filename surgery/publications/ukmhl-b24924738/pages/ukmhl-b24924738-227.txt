Patients who try it are put into a warm bath. It is very probable, that its efficacy has been much exaggerated, and that many of the cases, stated to have been cured by it, have been gouty or rheu- matic affections.

They are mostly met with in the knee, though we have instances on record of their being found in the arti- culation of the rjaw, ankle^and elbow.

FIRST LINES OF THE 392 with it an eschar is made along the whole front of the tu- mour, about half an inch broad. This method may now be considered as entirely exploded ; when the eschar sepa- rates the opening seldom, extends into the tunica vaginalis, and an instrument must after all be employed to discharge the fluid. The destruction of a part of the scrotum is quite unnecessary ; and the operation is both more pain- ful and less certain in its effect, than any of the others aboyementioned. INCISION. The anterior and inferior part of the tumour is to have a, puncture made in it, of sufficient size to enable the opera- tor to introduce the end of his fore finger into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. This he should do immediately, and before the fluid is all discharged, and the tunica vaginalis collapsed. Then, with a blunt-pointed curved bistoury, the tunica vaginalis may be safely divided throughout its whole length. When the tunica vaginalis is very much diseased, this method has the advantage of allowing the operator to re- move any part ot tlie thickened indurated membrane, .rifter the operation the wound is to be covered with a small quantity of fine lint, over which a pledget is to be placed. This plan of cure is certainly superior to that by caustic ; but it is not so good as the employment of a seton, in the way recommended by Mr. Pott. INJECTION. The Hydrocele is to be tapped with a trocar at its ante- rior and inferior part, and as soon as the fluid is entirely discharged, the cavity of the tunica vaginalis is to be dis- tended to its former dimensions with an injection, com- posed of two parts of red wine, and one of warm water. 1 he injection is to be allowed to remain in the part about

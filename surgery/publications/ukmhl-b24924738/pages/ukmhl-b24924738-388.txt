1IRST LINES OF TI1E 340 pose, cither that it is already gangrenous, or that gangrene is inevitable, and consequently he may delay returning it into its natural situation. But, notwithstanding this sus- picious colour ot the intestine, its firmness will evince that it is not in the state of gangrene, and its immediate reduc- tion ought therefore to be put into practice. The reco- very of a portion of intestine, so .circumstanced, is always a matter of uncertainty, but the propriety of speedily re- placing it in its natural situation, is a thing most certain. In case it should mortify, after being reduced, all hopes of the preservation of life are not to be abandoned, as we shall again notice at a proper opportunity. It is unnecessary to state any thing here concerning the reduction of protruded omentum, as every useful informa- tion on the subject will be found in the chapter on hernia?, OF GASTRORAPIIE, Gastroraphe is a quilled suture employed to unite wounds penetrating the cavity of the abdomen. The only circumstance in which it differs from the quilled suture already described, is its being introduced through both lips of the wound from within outward, in order not to endanger the adjacent viscera. Two needles are, therefore, placed on the same ligature. The perito- neum, muscles, and integuments, are all to be included in the suture. Gastroraphe is to be aided by the observance of a proper posture, the application of adhesive piaster, and the unit- ing bandage. Every thing that puts the abdominal mus- cles into action, drags the suture, irritates the wound, and creates a risk of the t hreads cutting their way through the part, in which they are introduced, consequently it must be avoided. To prevent exertion of the muscles, the bowels are to be emptied by clysters. Opium quiets the sickness frequently attendant on wounds of the abdomen. The ri- gorous adoption of antiphlogistic means is to be observed.

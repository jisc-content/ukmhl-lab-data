PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 453 linen tent, and it is to be kept from slipping out by tapes, passed through the two little rings at the sides of the in* strument. Some surgeons are in the habit of passing an elastic gum catheter into the bladder through the cannula, and then taking the latter away. I cannot say, that I can perceive any utility, or advantage in this method. An elastic gum catheter does not fill the wound ; consequently, Ihe urine is discharged, not only through its cavity, but aLo between the track of the wound and the circumference of the in- strument, so that the chance of the urine becoming diffused into the cellular membrane is not guarded against, as it is by allowing the cannula to remain in the wound, at leasi, two, of three days, until inflammation has agglutinated to- gether the surrounding cellular substance, and removed the possibility of the urine becoming extravasated. It is now known, that after the above period, the cannula may be safely and easily taken out, and Introduced, as occasion may require. However, it is obvious, that the exit made for the urine, by the above operation, is merely designed as a temporary one, and that, as soon as the impediment to the passage of the water through the urethra is removed, the wound ought tb be allowed to heal. Whenever the prostate glaud is known io be very much enlarged, one would certainly prefer this mode of operating to puncturing the bladder through the rectum. The wound is made at a place, where there is no risk of injuring any part of importance; but, in this method, little as the chance is of an extravasation of the urine taking place, it is certainly a possible event, and the opening is not made in a depending situation, so that the whole of the urine cannot be conveniently evacuated, OP THE PUNCTURE THROUGH THE RECTUM.

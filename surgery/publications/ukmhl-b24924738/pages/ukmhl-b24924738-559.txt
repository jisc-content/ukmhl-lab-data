Unless the tumefaction be very considerable, the diag- nosis of a fracture of the ossa nasi is too obvious to need any detail. TREATMENT. The displaced portions of bone are to be raised, or de- pressed, to their proper level, by introducing a probe, rolled round with lint, to the upper part of the nostril, and moving the pieces of bone into their proper position, by means of the conjoint operation of the probe on the inside, and of the fingers on the outside, of the fracture. It the perpendicular process of the os ethmoides should be beaten to one side, it is to be replaced, as well as circumstances will allow, with the aid of a probe, if there should be reason to conjecture, that die crista galli is driven inward, and compresses the brain, the surgeon, after elevating the bony arch formed by the ossa nasi, should gently endea- vour to draw down the perpendicular lamella of the eth- moid bone. The ossa nasi, when replaced, are not very liable to be drawn out of their proper situation by the action of mus- cles : however, if the broken pieces should have a propen- sity to fall inward, they must be supported by dossils of lint, smeared with any softeniug oiutn>ent, and introduced under the fracilire. Most writers reconene d tubes, of a proper shape, to be placed in the nostrils, i-i order to sup- port the broken portions ofbone ; but, i believe, that te>v modern practical surgeons would think these instruments necessary.

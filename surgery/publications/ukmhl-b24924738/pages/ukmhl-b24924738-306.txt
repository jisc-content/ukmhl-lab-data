A pair of small dissecting forceps, and a pair of very sharp scissars, suffice for the operation. Scarpa has found it unnecessary to detach every pterygium, from its point to the termination of its basis ; but only to continue the detachment from its point, as far as the commencement of the sclerotica, and then to complete its separation from thereye by a semilunar transverse incision,* comprehend- ing a portion of the conjunctiva one line in breadth. The subsequent part of the treatment chiefly consists in pre- venting inflammation. 2. ENCANTHIS. The encantliis,in the incipient state, is a small, soft, red, and sometimes livid excrescence, growing from the carun- cida lachry mails, and neighbouring semilunar fold of the conjunctiva. In the inveterate state its magnitude is con- siderable ; and its roots extend beyond the caruncula la- chrymalis, along the lining of one or both eyelids. The com- plaint excites chronic ophthalmy, prevents the complete closure of the eye, and by compressing and displacing the pttneta lachrymalia, obstructs the free passage of tears into the nose. The surface of the excrescence is at first granulated like a mulberry, but after the tumour has be- come laige, only a part of its outside has the above appear- ance, while the rest sterns like a smooth, whitish, ash-co- loured substance. In this advanced state the body of the encanlhis divides (to use Scarpa’s figurative expression) like a swallow’s tail, so as to form two elongations, one of which extends along the inner surface of the upper eyelid, the other along the inside of the lon er one. As ofpterygium, so there is a malignant species of cn- c ant h is, denoted by its dull red colour, bleeding tendency,

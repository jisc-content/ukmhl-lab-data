Thus the operation is to be repeated as often as may be necessary. By this method the cyst of the abscess, particularly its upper portion, is not. allowed to be distended, and its ca- vity gradually diminishes in size. In conjunction with this treatment, attempts may Le made to promote the absorption of the matter by electri- * city ; giving two or three limes a week a scruple of zincum vitriol. as an emetic; and by blistering the integuments. Care should be taken not to apply the blister at a part where it may be necessary to make a puncture in the ab- scess. A discharge should be kept up. from the blistered surface by the savin cerate. When there is reason to sup- pose the vertebrae, diseased, issues are sometimes beneficial. When the abscess seems disposed to burst by ulceration, the event may sometimes be prevented by a timely punc- ture at a part of the tumour, where the integuments are tree from inflammation. CHAP.

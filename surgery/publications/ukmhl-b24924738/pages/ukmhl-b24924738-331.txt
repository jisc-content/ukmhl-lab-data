The first operation is termed couching, or depression, of the ca- taract; the second is named extraction. Each method has its advocates ; and as I have given a detail of the argu- ments in favour of couching in another publication,* I shall only premise a description of this operation by stating, that it is applicable to every species of the malady ; that it produces subsequent symptoms far less severe and danger- ous than those which frequently happen after extraction; that it may be successfully repeated when any incidental circumstance has rendered the primary attempts fruitless ; that it is much the most easy operation of the two ; that it is not so liable as extraction to be followed by the secondary membranous cataract; and that Pott, Callisen, Lucas, Scarpa, Hey, Latta, and many other eminent and unbi- assed surgeons have given it the preference. DESCRIPTION OF COUCHING, OR DEPRESSION OF THE CATARACT. The best needle is the one which Scarpa employs,t or else that used by Mr. Hey.^ If the curved couching needle is made use of, it is to be held with the convexity of its cur- vature forward, its point backward, and its handle parallel to the patient’s temple.

366 FIRST LINES OF THE and to adhesions, which they have contracted with each other, or with the inside of the sac. Persons afflicted in this manner should avoid every rough description of exercise; should support the hernial tumour with a bandage, and carefully keep it out of the way of all harm from pressure, bruises, &c. and should be particularly attentive to avoid all irregularity of diet and costiveness. As Mr. Pott observes, it is fit that mankind should be apprised that the quiet, inoffensive state of this case is by no means to be depended upon : an-inflam mat ion of that part of the gut which is down ; any obstruction to the passage of the aliment, or faeces through it; a stricture made on it by the opening through which it protrudes; are circum- stances always likely to put the life of the patient into danger. A stricture, in this case, is more dangerous than in or- dinary instances, because there is hardly a possibility of obtaining relief, except by an operation. An irreducible omental hernia, free from constriction and inflammation, is not productive of much immediate dan- ger; but it is always apt to induce perilous symptoms, when affected with inflammation from any accidental cause. Such patients may always be considered very lia- ble to a protrusion of a piece of intestine into the sac. Some hernia} are reducible, but not without difficulty, the patient being subjected to a good deal of pain and danger. The difficulty of rcducii**, the pain, and the danger, may depend on the magnitude of the piece of omentum, or its inflamed state; the quantity of intestine and mesen- tery ; an inflammation of the gut, or its distention by fasces or air ; or on the smallness of the aperture through which the hernia protrudes. But, as Mr. Pott remarks, to what- ever cause it be owing, if the prolapsed body cannot be im- mediately replaced, and the patient suffers pain, or is pre-

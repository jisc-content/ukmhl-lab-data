48 FIRST LINES OF THE fusion and laceration. The former are frequently rendered more serious by being at the same time poisoned. The danger of wounds is proportioned to several cir- cumstance? highly deserving attention. 1. 1 heir size. 2. The degree of violence done to the fibres in addition to their mere division. 3. The little power which the part has of repairing its injuries. 4. Its great importance to the constitution. I shall not mention age ana kind of constitution, as these have influence in all disorders, s 1. The .removal of a large adipose tumour is often ac- complished without injuring any one part of importance, and yet the magnitude of the wound may occasion death* 2. A man cannot bear a large incised, and lacerated wound equally well ; because in the latter case, the fibres are not only divided, but stretched, and otherwise injured. I have seen the integuments, covering the anterior surface of the tibia, torn in a straight direction, from the upper head of that bone, nearly to the foot: mortification of the limb took place rapidly, and (he man died. Ilad this been a simple incision, such fatal consequences would, probably, not have happened, since the wound of ampu- tation, even when a bulky thigh is removed, is not fre- quently the cause of death. All contused and gun-shot wounds are, for this reason, more perilous, than if they were simple breaches of continuity. o. Joints seem to possess but feeble power of repairin'1'' their injuries, and the whole constitution becomes very often dangerously disturbed in such cases. The system seems to sympathize with the local imperfection. 4. The slightest wound of a part, the functions of which are intimately connected with life, is often fatal. The brain, stomach, &c. Wounds may be complicated with injury of consider- able blood-vessels, and nerves; lodgment of extraneous substances, and poisonous matter in them ; fractured bones;

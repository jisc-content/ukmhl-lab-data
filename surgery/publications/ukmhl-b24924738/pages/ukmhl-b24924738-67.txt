PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 3; The boil is very tardy in bursting, but it docs so at last. It may commonly be opened advantageously with a lance before this event. The contents should than be squeezed out, and every portion of the cyst extracted, if it can be done with ease, and without giving much pain. hen this has been accomplished the cure soon follows. Gentle aperients, and the antiphlogistic regimen, which are proper in all local inflammations, are not to be omitted in this case. Camphorated mercurial ointment, and gum ammonia- ctim, are proper applications for discussing any indura- tion that may remain afterwards. CHAP. VIII. CARBUNCLE. THE carbuncle is a malignant kind of boil, an hich occa- sions a gangrenous suppuration beneath the skin, and is often attended with great danger. It is one ot the symp- toms of the plague and other malignant fevers. Its progress to the gangrenous state is sometimes rapid ; at other times slow. Its size varies considerably. It lias been known to be as large as a common plate. Consider- able local pain, and induration always attend the disease. As the complaint advances, several apertures generally form in the tumour. Through these openings a yellow, greenish, bloody, irritating discharge flows out. In these cases there is oftentimes very extensive slough- ing deeply situated, when no sign of mortification can be externally discerned. The concomitant fever is, at first, of the sympathetic in- flammatory kind ; but it is soon observed to lose the strong actions of that, and to assume the typhoid nature.

]* first lines of the \ ric acid, than pus. If water be added to such solutions, the pus is precipitated to the bottom ; while the mucus, instead of being com lately precipitated, forms swimming flakes. A solution of caustic alkali dissolves both pus and mucus; but, when water is added, the pus becomes separated, but not the mucus. CYSTS OF ABSCESSCS. If there were not some boundary to au abscess, some partition between the pus and the cavities of the cellular substance, the matter would diffuse itself extensively on all sides, like the air in emphysema, or the water in, cedema. To prevent this circumstance, we find, that coagulating lymph is deposited immediately around the collection of matter; and becoming organized, assumes the appearance of a membranous cyst. In abscesses of long standing, the cysts arc often of very considerable thickness, while in other collections of matter, that have been sudden in their formation, /and have not existed, long, the surrounding lymph Iras scarcely had time to be converted into a vascular membranous cyst./ The cysts of all abscesses are both secreting, and absorbing surfaces. When the pus has been completely discharged by a punc- ture, the cavity soon becomes filled with pus again. Very large and palpable collections of matter are often observed to disappear entirely, and in a manner only to be explained by the action of the absorbents. Matter always tends to the surface of the body, making its way through a considerable .thickness of parts, in order to arrive there. Even when there is but a delicate mcm- Orand between the matter, and some internal cavity of the body, the abscess generally bursts externally,' though it may have to make its way through a considerable thick- ness of substance. Its progress is always aided by the relaxation of the skin, situated immediately over the ab- scess. The skin, in this situation, is always looser, than

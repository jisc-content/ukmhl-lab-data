Even scirrhus and cancer, when situated in this part, have been improperly blended with numerous other morbid affec- tions, and comprehended under one common title,s«rcoce/e.

The testicle is sometimes converted into a truly scrophu- lous mass. It is enlarged in size; and when cut into, a whitish or yellowish coagulated matter is discovered, mix- ed with pus. This complaint is not attended with so much pain and induration as a scirrhous disorder of the testicle, nor does it produce any unfavourable state of the health.

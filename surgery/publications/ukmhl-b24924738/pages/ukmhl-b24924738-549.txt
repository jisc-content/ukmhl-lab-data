A WHITLOW is a very painful, inflammatory swell- ing, about the extremity of the finger, or at the root, or sides of the nail, and it is very prone to suppurate. Au- thors describe different sorts of whitlows. Only four merit distinction, and these chiefly differ from one another merely in regard to the depth of the situation, which they oc- cupy. The first is situated under the cuticle, and begins at the corner of the nail, in the form of a little tumour, which spreads all round. When matter is collected, it may be discharged, by cutting the cuticle with a pair of scis- sars; a thing, which may be accomplished without the slightest pain. Sometimes, the natural connexions of the root of the nail are destroyed, and this part separates to make way for a new nail, which nature produces. In the second species, an unpleasant sensation of heat is experienced at the extremity of the finger, for some days; the part becomes gradually more tender and painful; it swells, but the skin is not discoloured ; and, if the inflam- mation should not end in resolution, a thin matter collects between the skin and subjacent parts. On this fluid being evacuated by an incision, immediate relief is generally ob- tained. The third kind of whitlow, is .situated in the theca of the flexor tendons of the fingers. When the inflammation continues beyond a certain period, the suppuration, some- times, becomes palpable about the joints, and even in the hand, by a fluctuation, which is not distinguishable over

Bleeding is to be practised ; the mildest purgatives, such as oleum Heim, manna, and natron HlHolalum, are to be given; and perfect quietude is to be prescribed. In cut wounds we usually know whether any of the bowels are Ss wounded. When it is a punctured wound, without evidence of any important viscus being injured, the dressings should be quite simple and superficial.

The patient is to be bled freely, and the smallness ot the pulse, a peculiarity in inflammation of the peritoneum and bowels, is not to deter the surgeon from using the lancet, but ought rather to convince him of the existence of such inflammation. Hernia; often occur after wounds penetrating the abdo- men have healed ; it is therefore recommended to wear a truss afterwards on the situation of the cicatrix. PROTRUSION OF T1IF. VISCERA. A portion of intestine, or omentum, usually protrudes through large wounds-penetrating the abdomen. The sooner such parts arc returned, the more effectually will the irritation, arising from exposure, and the pressure of the circumference of the wound on them, be prevented. Fomenting the protruded parts, as is sometimes recom- mended, is a fruitless measure, and hurtful, inasmuch as it

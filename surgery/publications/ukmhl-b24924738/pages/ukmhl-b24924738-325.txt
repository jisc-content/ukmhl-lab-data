The first effect of an incipient opacity is a mist before the eyes, surrounding every object, and after- wards gradually increasing so much in density as to ren- der things quite invisible. The opacity, behind the pupil, increases‚Äù in proportion as the cloudiness in vision aug- ments. As the lens is thick at its centre, and thin at its edo-e, the incipient opacity, when viewed externally, al- ways seems the greatest in the middle of the pupil; while the circumference of the lens appears like a black ring, surrounding the white nucleus ot the crystalline. Some ray oi light are capable of penetrating the thin margin of the lens in its most opaque state; and hence patients with cataracts are almost always able to distinguish light from darkness; and in the early stage of the complaint discern objects best when these are a little on one side of the axis of vision, and not immediately opposite the eye. Ilencg also such patients see better in a moderate, than a brilliant

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 347 In about eight days the sutures may generally be re- moved, and the cure is to be conducted with the use of sticking plaster, and the uniting bandage, and the observ- ance of a position that affords the greatest degree of relax- ation to the injured muscles. When any part of consequence is wounded, and pours forth its contents into the cavity of the peritoneum, it is re- commended to leave the most depending angle of the wound unclosed. In a memoir dn the abuse of sutures, inserted in the third volume of the Academy of Surgery, we find cases which evince, that wounds of the belly readily unite by means of a suitable posture, and a proper bandage, without having recourse to gastroraphe. These are, however, less decisive than relations of the Cajsarean operation, the extensive wound of which has oftentimes been healed by these sim- ple means, after the failure of sutures. A bandage, made upon the plan of an eighteen tailed one, might be very useful in longitudinal wounds of the abdomen. It is not only possible to dispense with gastroraphe, in the treatment of wounds of the abdomen, it has even been manifested, that this operation has sometimes occasioned very bad symptoms. Under certain circumstances, it may however be essentially necessary to practise gastro- raphe. For instance, were a large wound to be made across the parietes of the abdomen, a suture might becoipe indis- pensably necessary to prevent a protrusion of the bowels. Yet even in this case, the sutures should be as few in num- ber as possible. EXTRAVASATION IN THE ABDOMEN. The ordinary consequence of a wound, piercing any of the parts contained in the bag of the peritoneum, is an ex- travasation of a fluid among the surrounding viscera. This fluid may be undigested aliment, chyle, pancreatic juice,

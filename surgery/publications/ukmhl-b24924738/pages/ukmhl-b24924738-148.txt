TIRST LINES OF THE â– vvith pain in the forehead, and root of the nose j which have been from the first extremely red, and always continue of the same dimensions; which either bleed spontaneously 01 lorn the slightest causes; which sometimes create pain, are fixed in the nose, and cannot be moved backward and forward in respiration ; and, lastly, which are hard to the touch, produce a fetid discharge, and will not allow a probe to be passed with freedom round their anteriour portion. The reason assigned for this inculcation is the impossi- nlity of extirpating such polypi completely, and the dan- gei of irritating a malignant disease, so as to convert it into carcinoma. However, there is certainly truth in the following remarks made by Richter on this subject : It is not to be denied that polypi of the first description may generally be easily extracted with little pain, because they are small, no where adherent, and in every respect benign. It is equally certain that polypi of the latter kind generally cannot be extracted without difficulty ; they are large, complicated with adhesions, and bleed pro. fusely. But is a patient thus afflicted to be left without as- sistance ? When the polypus is so large that its root can- not be got at, its anteriour part is to be taken hold of, and the tumour extracted piecemeal. Experience does not prove that the polypus, which often bleeds profusely, is apt to occasion a violent hemorrhage in the operation; and even if it should do so, powerful measures may be adopted with a certainty of success. If the polypus should be here and there adherent to the membrane investing the nostrils, it is proper to separate it before the operation; Richter recommends for this purpose the introduction of Jong, flat, thin, pieces of tortoise-shell. The only ground on which the operation becomes im- proper is the malignant nature of the polypus ; so far I differ from Richter, and coincide w ith Pott. But I am of

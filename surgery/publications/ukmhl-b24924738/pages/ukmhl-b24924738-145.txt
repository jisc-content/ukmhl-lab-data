Their blades arc perforated by holes, and are internally rough, in order to take hold of the tumour more firmly. The handles should be rather long, m order that the instrument may be more firmly closed, and more conveniently twisted. Forceps are, however, not applicable to all cases, lhe anteriour part of the polypus is sometimes quite hard, and distends the nostrils so much, that when the forceps arc in- troduced the blades are so separated from each other by the part of the tumour which is between them, that the in- strument cannot be introduced sufficiently far to take hold of the tumour at a proper depth; or it introduced to a proper depth, it cannot be closed. In such cases one might, perhaps, advantageously make use of a pair of forceps, the blades of which may be separated, and put together again at the joint, and diverge from each other behind the joint, and touch again at their extremities. After separating the two pieces, the blades might be sepa- rately introduced, and then joined together again ; and the anteriour indurated portion of the polypus might lie in the interspace, without preventing the closure of the in- strument. It is of importance to take hold of the polypus close to its root; for in this way the whole tumour is commonly extracted, and there is less danger in regard to hemorrhage, which is naturally more profuse when the polypus is broken at the thick, middle, part of its body. This plan may easily be pursued when the polypus is not too large, But in many instances the tumour is so large, and the nostril so completely occupied, that it is impracticable to get hold of the root. In this circumstance it is often al- together impossible even to discover where the root lies. "VVe must then take hold of the polypus as high as possi- ble, and attempt to extract it.

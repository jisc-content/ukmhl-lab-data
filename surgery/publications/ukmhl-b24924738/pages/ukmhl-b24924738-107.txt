PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 75 the application of such violence to (he divided fibre?, that suppuration, and even sloughing of some part of the wounded surface, are generally the consequences. From severe contused and lacerated wounds a rapid mortification often arises, which extends itself over a whole limb, and frequently occasions death. The inflammation attending lacerated and contused wounds seldom restricts itself to those moderate bounds, in which alone the process of adhesion can take place. Thus the advantageous prospect of union by the first intention disappears, and we arc left to promote a more circuitous plan of cure instituted by nature. The first indication is to remove extraneous bodies, the irritation of which always aggravates the local mischief ; and in these wounds extraneous bodies are much more fre- quently present than in wounds made with clean sharp in- struments. As the inflammation that follows is likely to be violent, it is proper to promote any moderate effusion of blood from the wound, and in bad cases even to employ the lancet. Though wo cannot expect that any considerable extent of contused and lacerated wounds will heal by the first in- tention, yet we know that it is advantageous to approxi- mate their lips, just as we do those of incised wounds. When a wound is left gaping, there is not only a larger ca- vity for nature to fill up, but no opportunity is afforded to any part of the wound that may be disposed to unite at once to do so. For it is to be observed, that different parts of wounds of this description arc injured by different de- grees of violence. In some places the violence may not totally prevent the effusion of coagulating lymph ; in some it renders suppuration inevitable; while in others, that have been most forcibly injured, sloughing must happen.- I am not intending to inculcate, that contused and lace- rated wounds are to be put in a state of apposition with the same exactness as incised ones. Their jagged and irregular

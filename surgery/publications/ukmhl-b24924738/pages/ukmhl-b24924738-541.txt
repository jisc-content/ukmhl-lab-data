PRACTICE OF SURGERY. V happen after amputations. At all events, it is a superflu- ous, useless measure, as a sharp saw, such as ought to be employed, will never be impeded by so slender a mem- brane as the periosteum. All that the operator ought to do, is to take care to cut completely down to the bone, all round its circumference. Thus a circular division of the periosteum will be made, and, on this precise situation, the saw should be placed. If the bone should happen to break, before the sawing is finished, the sharp projecting spiculce, thus occasioned, must be removed by means of an instrument, called bone- nippers. After the removal of the limb,' the femoral artery is to be taken hold of with a pair of forceps, and tied, wi.'hout in- cluding the accompanying branches of the anterior crural nerve in the ligature. None of the surrounding flesh ought to be tied, though the ligature should undoubtedly be placed round the artery, just where this vessel emerges from its lateral connexions. The other arteries are usually taken up with a tenaculum. After tying as many vessels as rccpiire it, one half of each ligature is lo be cut off near the surface of the stump. As Mr. Alanson judiciously directs, when the large ves- sels are tied, that the tourniquet should immediately be slackened, arid the wound well cleaned, to detect any ves- sel, that might otherwise lie concealed with its orifice blocked up by coagulated blood ; and, before the wound is dressed, its whole surface should be examined with the greatest accuracy. By this means, a pulsation may often be discerned, where no hemorrhage has previously appear- - ed, and a small clot of blood may be removed from the mouth of a considerable artery. The whole surface of the wound should always be well cleaned with a soft sponge, and warm water, as the lodg- ment of much coagulated blood would undoubtedly beun- iavourable to the speedy union of the wound.

FIRST LINES OF THE 9o sion, since we have every reason to believe, that the poisons ot serpents are quite pernicious enough in their nature to account for every bad effect. They indeed oftentimes ap- peal to. operate on the system in a more sudden manner than through the medium of the absorbents ; whether we term it sympathy, or Compare the effect to thatnf electri- city, is ot little consequence treatment ok the bite of a viper. . The treatment is divided into the local and constitu- tional means. By the former we endeavour to prevent the 1 eftc‘?(s absorption - by the hitter we strive to appease the derangement of the system, arising either from absorp- tion ot the poison, or per co/i&ensum. 1. TREATMENT APPLIED TO THE WOUND. In the first section of this chapter I have explained vari- ous means for the purpose of preventing the ill conse- quences of absorption. The Abbe Fontana informs us, that tying a ligatureround the limb on the side of the wound towards the heart, was the only thing he observed to be uselul. 1 cannot give my approbation to this method which takes no step to prevent the poison entering the’ mouths of the lymphatics, but only stops it after it h;* en- tered, from proceeding beyond the ligature towards the thoracic duct. The ligature continued for a long time applied, must itself create considerable swelling of the limb, and very serious inconvenience. At length it is taiven awAy, and v, hat then remains to impede the pro- gress of the virus into the blood-vessels ? Excision of the injured part, as soon as possible after the occurrence of the accident, is, beyond a doubt, the most efficacious and advisable plan. All the other means designed to extract the poison completely from the wound, or to destroy its pernicious nature, as uncertain in their agency, ought always to yield the preference toexci- Me u l •

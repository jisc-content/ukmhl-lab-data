164 FIRST LINES OF THE A powder, composed of savin and cerugo reris in equal proportions, is a common and very efficacious remedy ; it is particularly useful in destroying warts growing around tlie corona glandis. Lunar caustic is another application, which may be em- ployed W lien the excrescences arc very large, they may always be extirpated with the knife, and with more safety than by the use of stimulants; for large irritable warts, when sti- mulated, sometimes form very unpleasant sores, which throw out fqngoilsgranulations.

In every case of mortification there are two grand cu- nt.ve UKl.cations = vis. I. To put a slop the progress of the m,sch.cf; 2. To promote the separation of the mor- titled from the living parts. The extent tff death in the part affected may probably be considerably influenced by the mode of treatment, adopted during the incipient stage of mortification, term- ed gangrene. When the disorder is the, effect of inflam- mation, we are bound to believe that the living circum- ihrence f* inflamed in the highest degree. Fomentations and warm emollient poultices are very commonly applied ; hut, as heat always increases action, they should not often bemused in this state. Cold, too long applied, is apt to debilitate; but it previously lessens vascular action, the grand object in view. The lotio aq. lilharg. acet. is as good an application as can be used ; but, it is to be re- membered, that here, as in cases of common inflammation, 4he feelings and comfort of the patient must determine, whether warm or cold applications are best. * ^1C P*dn> attending the change from violent phleg* monous inflammations into gangrene, is excessive, opium, and when there is a tendency to delirium, camphor should be administered. When the gangrenous part is converted into a black, insensible, fibrous mass, it is of little consequence what is applied to it; the living circumference then claims almost exclusive attention. If the application of cold, and the internal exhibition of opium and camphor, assisted by such treatment as is adapted to the inflammatory fever, check the further ex- pansioa of gangrene and sphacelus, the lymphatics next remove the particles of matter, connecting the slough to

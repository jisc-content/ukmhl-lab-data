513 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. In persons, who lead intemperate lives, the inflamma- tion is very often of the erysipelatous kind. INFLAMMATION OF TIIE ABSORBENTS. These vessels, we know, are susceptible of inflammation, as well as other parts. We frequently feel them extending from a part, iu which there is some species of local irrita- tion, like firm cords, of much greater thickness, than one can suppose would arise merely from the swollen coat's of these delicate vessels. The fact is, the adjoining cellular substance is also affected, and contributes to the swelling. The inflamed absorbents may sometimes be seen running from the wound, in the form of reddish streaks; and if. this appearance should extend, both towards the thoracic duct, and also in a direction from it, we may conclude, that the affection is in consequence of irritation, and not of absorption. After bleeding, they are found occasion- ally running upward to a glandular swelling, situated about the middle of the arm, in the course of the large vessels, and to another glandular tumour, situated over the muscles of the forearm arising from the internal condyle. The ' treatment of this sort of case is entirely antiphlogistic. INFLAMMATION OF THE VEIN. Another occasional ill consequence of venesection is an inflammation of the vein. This affection may differ in degree and extent, as well as in its progress. One degree of inflammation may only occasion a slight thickening of the venal tube, and an adhesion of its sides ; a more Vio- lent degree may produce abscesses, the matter of which may sometimes become blended with the circulating; fluids, and produce dangerous consequences; or it may be cir- cumscribed by the thickening and adhesion of the sur- rounding parts, and, like a common abscess, make its way to the surface. A good deal of sympathetic fever is likely to attend an extensive inflammation of the vein; and this L L

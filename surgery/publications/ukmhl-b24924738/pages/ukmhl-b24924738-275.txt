FISTULA L ACITIiYM A LIS. * WULNEVLR the tears cannot pass freely Yirough the ductus nhsalis into the nose, the lachrymal sac becomes distended, so as to form a preternatural tumour, situated just on one side of the root, of the nose, below the internal angle of the eye. The contents of the sac, however, are hot merely the tears, but also the mucus, which the sac it- self naturally secretes. In consequence of this state, the tears cannot freely enter the puncta lachrjjmdia; and, every now and then, a drop of this secretion falls from the corner of the eye down the cheek. On compressing the space between the eye and nose, the tumour is, ior a time, diminished, in consequence of its' contents regurgitating through the punctu laclir i/m alia ; and also, in some mea- sure (when the obstruction in the nasal duct is slight), by reason of their passing downward into tue nose. This is the first stage oi the disease, absurdly named the fistula lachrjjmalis. The second stage is, when-ulceration has formed an ex- ternal aperture in the lachrymal sac, which ulcerated open- ing is prevented from healing by the contents ot the sac Continually oozing through it.

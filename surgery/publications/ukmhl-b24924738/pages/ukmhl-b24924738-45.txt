PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 15 ber. These circumstances leave no doubt of there being; a hidden collection of matter. A man, endued with great nicety of touch, can often feel the undulations of matter, even when deeply lodged. theory op suppuration. The exposure of the internal surfaces and structure of the body, continued for a certain time, necessarily occa- sions suppuration. Here the influence of the air is not the cause ; for, were a wound to be made into a cavity naturally closed, pus would be formed, after a certain time, even in a vacuum. When matter forms in circum- scribed cavities without a wound, the air cannot be sus- pected as a cause : nor docs the air, in emphysematous cases, excite suppuration. The Sympathetic fever, attendant on inflammation, has been considered an essential step to suppuration ; but with little foundation. Is there not a regular secretion of pus from the most indolent ulcers ? Is there not the same pro- cess on every blistered surface ? In such cases, is there not oftentimes a total absence of fever ? That dead animal matter cannot be converted into pus, is proved by sloughs of the cellular membrane, tendons, fascia;, &c. &c. remaining unchanged in abscesses a con- siderable time, and by dead bone lying unaltered in pus for many months. Whatever diminution of these sub- stances may, under such circumstances, happen, occurs only on that side, which is next to the living solids, and can be satisfactorily accounted for on the principle of absorption. The idea that fermentation contributes to the formation of pus, is quite destitute of foundation. The discharge of pus from secreting surfaces, without any loss of sub- stance ; the stationary state of many abscesses ; the back- wardness of matter to become putrid, while unexposed to the air; sufficiently evince, that no fermenting power is present.

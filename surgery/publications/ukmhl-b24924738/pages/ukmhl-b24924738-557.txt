The above gentleman informs us, that Mr. Pott, in his lectures, used to mention cases, in which patients had suf- fered distracting pain, followed by convulsions, and other 0 symptoms, which could only be ascribed to nervous irrita- tion. Mr. Abcrnethy lias treated this subject with much discrimination ; lie explains what nerves are exposed to injury; what are the effects likely to be produced by such an accident; and what means are most likely to afford relief. The two cutaneous nerves are most in the way of the lancet. Most frequently all their branches pass beneath the veins at the bend of the arm ; but sometimes many small filaments are detached from these branches, and pro- ceed over the vessels. The above eminent surgeon re- marks, that when a nerve is irritated, at any part, between its 01 igin and termination, a sensation is felt, as it some injury were done to the parts, which it supplies. Hence, when the cutaneous nerves are injured, the integuments of the forearm would seem to suffer pain. It seems highly probable, that some symptom conse- quent to venesection, in certain instances, have been un- foundedly imputed to the irritation of a nerve, arising fiom its partial division. As Mr. Abcrnethy observes, in the many operations which are performed, and in wounds of daily occurrence, it would be strange, if a partial di- vision of a nerve should not happen; yet no peculiar symptoms usually ensue. The practice of completing the division of the nerve, supposed to be injured, is very questionable, in regard to the utility which it presents. However, if the surgeon should think the plan justifiable, a transverse incision may i, l2

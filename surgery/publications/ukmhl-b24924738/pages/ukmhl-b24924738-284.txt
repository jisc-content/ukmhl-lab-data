FIRST LINES OF THE day, lest the operation should create too much pain and inflammation. The prevention of the hairs growing again in the same position, is frequentl y very difficult. After plucking out the hairs, the most successful plan is tosmear the whole inner half of the margin of the eyelid, by means of a fine hair pencil, with theaq. amnion, pur., or a solution of the argentum nitratum. The second kind of case, called entropium, is far the inost frequent. In the upper eyelid the defect is often owing to a relaxed state of the legator muscle ; and then it may sometimes be cured by supporting the eyelid for some time with tlie aid of sticking plaster, but almost always by producing a cicatrix. , r The most common cause of the entropium is an unna- tural relaxation of the skin of the eyelid ; and, in this case, it is generally requisite to remove a portion of it. ‘ • I r ■' <• * > 1 ‘ ’ t PTOSIS. lids is an affection of the upper eyelid, which the pa- tient cannot elevate in the natural manner. There are va- rieties of the complaint; the first depends on a preterna- tural elongation of (lie skin of (he upper eyelid ; the second on a weakness or total paralysis of the levator muscle ; hrkl the third on a spasmodic contraction of the orbicularis palpebrdrum. , The first kind is the most frequent, and is cured by the removal of the redundant integuments of the eyelid. i he second species is principally met with in old per- sons.-in whom the cure is often impracticable. This sort of ptosis sometimes seems to be symptomatic of other af- ,feet ions, 'chlorosis j irriiation in the stomach and bowels, worms, &c.' Sometimes it is entirely a local defect. The chief means of cure are, the external use of the tinc- 1 live of cantharidos and cold water ; the shower bath ; the internal exhibition of bark $ the use of camphorated lini* Incut; electricity. This ptosis is frequently periodical. : . .< i •

30* first Lines of the bited in tlie present ones; but, on the whole, the timely employment of the knife merits the most confidence. Ihe following' kinds of cases have, however, yielded tit particular remedies. A malignant exceedingly painful ulcer in the tongue, sunounded with a good deal of inflammatorv hardness, has been cured by the continued internal use of opium! The dose is to be gradually augmented ; patients are stated to have taken, at last, eighteen grains in one day. One species of malignant ulcer yields to the long conti- nued exhibition of tartar emetic. The doses musT be in- creased, in proportion to the time which elapses from the first taking of the medicine. ^ ery malignant and unyielding sores on the tongue are said to have been cured by repeatedly applying leeches to the undersurface of this organ., It would be inexcusable to pass over in silence such ill- conditioned ulcers of the tongue as originate during vio- lent salivations. Sometimes similar sores, produced by the same cause, take place, at the same time, on the ton- sils; and, in this circumstance, inexperienced surgeons, or mistaken practitioners, who are blinded with the fear of syphilis, are very apt to suppose the sores to be venereal ones. This error leads to the freer use of mercury: the sores frequently slough ; and the patient’s health becoming greatly deranged, he is thrown into a state of great peril.

Violent inflammations, followed by ulcerations of this sort, are particularly apt to occur when patients, under the influence of mercury, catch cold. The removal of a cancerous portion of the tongue seems to need no particular description. A bistoury is the best instrument for the purpose; and the patient’s mouth

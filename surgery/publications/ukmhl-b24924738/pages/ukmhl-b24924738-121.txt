PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 89 Tier ally grow loose, and,on both accounts, their extraction can t hen be more easily practised. AY hen t hey are deeply lodged, they often spontaneously approach the surface on the occurrence ol suppuration, Lastly, ii is to be ob- served, that foreign bodies, of smooth figure, have often been found to lie, without the least inconvenience, in parts from which they could not. possibly be extracted. Hence the surgeon acts wisely who seeks at first to ex- tract only such foreign bodies as arc near the external open- ing, and are loose, and removable without much irritation. When they make pressure on an important part, a large artery, a considerable nerve, or important viscus, so as to create violent and dangerous symptoms from this cause, an incision is warrantable to remove them, even when deeply lodged. If a large artery bleed, it is to be exposed and tied, as in other wounds. Sometimes when there is reason to expect a fracture of the skull, an incision may be judi- ciously made to examine the bone. Depressed portions of the sternmh and ribs may require incisions, just as the same injuries of the cranium. When the ball lodges in any of flic large cavities, inci- sions arc usually improper, because it is impossible to trace the foreign body, and therefore they answer no direct pur- pose. When the ball enters far into the substance of a bone, to dilate the wound would also be of no utility. But all that 1 have said upon this head is insufficient to guide the surgeon in all cases. If the dilitation of the wound, for the purpose of extracting foreign bodies, should be less likely to aggravate the inflammation than the pre- sence of those bodies, then it is highly judicious to put it into practice. In every case where the ball cannot easily be discovered, one may safely decide to abandon all painful and irritating examinations. Experience shews that its lodgment rarely creates trouble, or bad symptoms. Lead has been observed

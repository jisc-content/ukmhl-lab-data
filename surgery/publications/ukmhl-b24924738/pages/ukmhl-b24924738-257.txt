PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 223 When the sawing is more advanced the surgeon must proceed with greater caution, and examine frequently with the point of a quill, whether any part of the circle is nearly or completely sawn through. When this is the case, the pressure of the instrument is to be inclined to the parts which are not sufficiently perforated. It is al- ways better to use a little force in raising the circle of bone with tire elevator, than to run any risk of injuring the dura mater and brain, by sawing too deeply. in some cases the surgeon clearly perceives, when the saw has penetrated the dipipe, by the sensation which the instrument communicates to his iingers, in consequence of entering a soft substance, immediately after having divid- ed the hard texture of the outer table, and by the blood which then appears in the circular groove, and on the teeth of the saw. 'flic operator, however, is not warranted in sawing too boldly until some criterion of this sort takes place; for in many skulls, and in different parts of (he same skull, tliediploe is very thin, and in old persons it is sometimes quite obliterated. When the surgeon knows with certainty that he lias arrived at tin* diploe, the rest of the saw ing should be ac- complished with slowness a id circumspection. After having removed the circle of bone, if the lower edges of the perforation next the dura mater arc splintered, they may lie made smooth by means of an instrument, called a lenticular. When the whole track of the depression cannot be raised, or the whole quantity of blood or matter cannot be evacuated, by making one perforation, 1 lie trephine must be applied again ; and indeed as often as the circumstances of each particular case demand. The mere removal of a portion of the skull cannot be regarded as very danger- ous, compared with the peril which would result from not completely effecting the object of the operation, viz. to re- move the pressure from the surface of the brain.

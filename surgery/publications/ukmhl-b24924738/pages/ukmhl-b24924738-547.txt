PRACTICE OF SLTlGERY. 505 tention is only to mention the method, which, I believe, the generality of the best modern surgeons prefer. The loss of blood is to be prevented, by compressing the ax- illary artery, in the way mentioned in the account of the am- putation of the arm in a high situation. With a large com- mon bistoury, a semicircular incision is to be made, with its convexity downward, across the integuments covering the deltoid muscle, about four inches below7 the acromion.* The skin is not to be detached; but the surgeon is to proceed im- mediately to raise the muscle from the bone, quite up to the joint. If the circumflex arteries should bleed much, they are now to be tied, before the operator proceeds further. Then the surgeon should cut the tendons passing over the joint, and, also, the capsular ligament, so as to be enabled to dislocate the head of the bone fromdhe glenoid cavity of the scapula. Having proceeded thus far, he is to take an amputating knife, and, with one stroke, divide the skin and other parts underneath the joint so as to complete the operation. The mouth of the axillary artery should be instantly taken hold of with the fingers, and tied as soon as possible. The flap of the deltoid muscle is next to be laid down, and its edge will then meet the margin of the wound below. v - / V ? ■ *.' ' ‘ . AMPUTATION OF THE FINGERSLAND TOES. The removal of a toe, or finger, though easy of accom- plishment to a skilful surgeon, may make another one, w ho is not aware of the proper method of operating, appear ex- ceedingly awkward. A small semilunar incision is to be made on the back of the finger, or toe, to be amputated. This wound must extend across the part, and its greatest » ... — — ■ — — * The horns of the semicircle, if I may use the expression, are to extend upward along the anterior and posterior margin of the.deltoid muscle.

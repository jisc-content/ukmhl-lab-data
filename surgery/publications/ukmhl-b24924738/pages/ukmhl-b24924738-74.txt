FIRST LINES OF TIIE 4t ciiap. xi. EFFECTS OF COLD. A FROZEN limb, in which there is no injury of any organic pari, no other alteration, but rigidity of the so- lids, and congelation of the fluids, may be recovered by the gradual communication of caloric to it. Experience has evinced, that the whole body may be in the same con- dition, having all its vital functions suspended, and yet be restored to animation. In this case, however, tlie gra- dual impartment ot heat will not avail, unless the heart and large bloodvessels retain the power of action. But, since animation, suspended in consequence of cold, has been restored, as late as six days after the occurrence, nei- ther hope nor exertion should be abandoned. W hen the whole body, or any part-of it, is frozen, warmth should be communicated to it very gradually. If a limb, that is not actually frozen, but excessively cold, be suddenly heated, very violent inflammation is the result. The part swells, and becomes red and blue, with insup- portable darting pains. When a part actually frozen is thus quickly warmed, the same symptoms arise, but in an aggravated degree, and they soon terminate in mortifica- tion. In order to thaw a frozen limb, it is best to rub it with snow, until sensibility and motion return. If the ear, or tip of the nose, should be the part concerned, care must be taken to avoid breaking it. If snow be not at hand, ice in wrater should be used instead of it. As soon as marks of sense and motion are discerned, the frictions arc to be made with brandy, oil of petroleum, oil of amber, tinc- ture of myrrh, or camphorated spirit of wine. The next object is to endeavour to excite a perspiration

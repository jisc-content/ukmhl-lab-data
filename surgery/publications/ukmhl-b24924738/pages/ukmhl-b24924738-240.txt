206 FIRST LINES OF THE gerous, and the brightest talents are required to guide its treatment. A limb in this condition submitted to the inspection and judgment oi the discerning and scientific practitioner, pre- sents to him one of the most difficult cases, requiring a sudden decision, that is met with in surgery. Under these circumstances the loss of one quarter of an hour often determines the event ot the case in a fatal manner. So great and considerable an injury inflicted upon parts endued with life and sensibility, capable of inflammation, suppuration, and gangrene, cannot be expected to take place without being followed by the most severe effects of constitutional sympathy. Let us picture to ourselves, that an experienced surgeon has decided it to be most pru- dent to attempt the preservation of a limb which has suf- fered a compound fracture; let us suppose that he has adopted the ablest method of treating tire case; the frac- ture being placed as nearly in its natural situation as cir- cumstances will admit, and the wounded integuments brought nicely into contact by means of adhesive plaster, in order that the union of the wound by the first intention may succeed. Perhaps the case may take such a fortunate and favourable course, that the degree of local inflamma- tion shall not be extensive, nor so high as to prevent the adhesive inflammation from uniting the external wound ; and whenever there is little local inflammation the sympa- thetic fever is alwaj^s proportionally moderate. The primary grand object in view, in all cases of com- pound fractures, is to convert them into simple ones, by uniting the external wound of the integuments as speedily as possible : an object which, from the laceration and con- tusion present, is often frustrated. Let us represent to ourselves another case, in which the local violence is followed by higher inflammation, so that the wound has not united by the first intention, and sup-

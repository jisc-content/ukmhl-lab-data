FIRST LINES OF TF1E 292 t. i patient to turn (lieeye towards the nose, is to introduce the instrument boldly through the sclerotic coat, at the dis- tance of not less than two lines from the margin of the cor- nea, in order to avoid the ciliary processes. 1 he exact place where the point of the needle should next be guided, is between the cataract and ciliary pro- cesses, in trout of the opaque lens and its capsule; but as the attempt to hit this delicate invisible mark borders upon impossibility, and might even endanger the iris, it seems satcr to direct the extremity of the instrument immediately over the opaque lens, and, in the fifst instance, to depress it a little downward with the convex flat surface of the end of the needle. -Thus room is made for the safe conveyance of the instrument between the cataract and ciliary processes, in front of the diseased crystalline and its capsule. Care must be taken, in this latter step of the operation, to keep the marked side of the handle forward, so as to have the point of the instrument turned away from the iris. The needle will now' be visible in the pupil, and its point is to- be pushed in a transverse direction as far as the inner edge of the lens. Then the operaor is to incline the handle of the instrument towards himself, by which means its point will bo diiected through the capsule into the substance of the opaque lens; and on inclining the needle downward and backward, the former will be lacerated, and conveyed with the latter deeply into the vitreous humour. It is deemed of great importance to lacerate the front layer of the capsule in the operation ; for this plan renders the absorption ot the opaque lens more certain and quick afterwards, and the occurrence of a secondary membranous cataract almost im possi ble. Such is Scarpaâ€™s excellent plan of operating for a Jinn cataract. W hen the case is a fluid, or milky one, the contents of the capsule flow out as soon as the little membranous sac is pierced with the needle, and they sometimes completely

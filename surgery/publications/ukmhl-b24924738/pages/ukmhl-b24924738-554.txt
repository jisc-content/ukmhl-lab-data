512 v FIRST LINES OF THE branch seems to be superficial, it may be punctured at once; but, in other cases, it is best to make first aSinall in- cision through the integuments. The bleeding may al- ways be stopped, after the due quantity of blood has been taken away, by means of a roller and compress. Some surgeons recommend cutting the vessel completely across, in order to allow it to'become retracted, when there is much hemorrhage after the operation. OCCASIONAL ILL CONSEQUENCES OF BLEEDING IN THE ARM. Ecchjjmosis. The most common troublesome occurrence, after bleed- pig, as far as my observation extends, is a swelling,, which originates from blood insinuating itself, from the orifice of the vein, into the adjacent cellular substance. Sometimes, this ecchj/mosis, as it is technically named, forms a tumour as large as, or even larger, than a walnut. The blood is mostly absorbed, in the course of a week, or ten days; and this desirable event should be promoted by applying lo- tions of vinegar, sal ammoniac, &c. In some instances, the tumour suppurates, and it becomes necessary to apply poultices. INFLAMMATION OF THE INTEGUMENTS, AND CELLULAR SUBSTANCE. This very often occurs, when the patient neglects to keep his arm quietly in a sling, for a day, or two, after the ope- ration. The improper motion of the limb makes the edges of the w ound rub against each other, and they necessarily inflame, and even suppurate. The inflammation and sup- puration are apt to be communicated to the surrounding skin and cellular substance, for a greater, or less extent. This case requires the same treatment, as other phleg- monous tumours.

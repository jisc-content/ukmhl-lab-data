PRACTICE OF SURGERY. m whole is returned. Though the whole may have been re- duced within the anus, still the gut is ready to protrude again at the first opportunity. Hence, the prolapsed piece of intestine must be pushed further upward, than just within the anus. Sometimes the reduction cannot be effected, on account of an incessant, involuntary, spasmodic straining. Here soft poultices, and opiate draughts, and clysters, are indi- cated. A large quantity of hardened excrement in the large intestines may render reduction difficult: in this case, the object can be accomplished, after the bowels have been emptied by clysters. When the prolapsed portion of the gut is very much swollen, its size may be lessened by applying leeches, or cold lotions to it; or by making long- continued pressure, before trying to reduce it. After the prolapsus has been reduced, the patient must keep himsejf, for a time, in a horizontal posture, for the intestine is very progc to fall down again. Also, to prevent this event, cor- roborant astringent clysters may be administered. But, above all things, it is essential to keep the bowels free from costiveness. When reduction is long delayed, the tumour may become painful and inflamed. Schmucker confirms, that the same symptoms as attend a strangulated hernia, and even death, may follow the protraction of the case. The immediate cause is the constriction, produced on the bowel by the sphincter' ani. The proper line of conduct for the surgeon is to employ general, and,particularly, topical bleeding; cold lotions ; and gentle, long-continued, equal pressure. If such measures should fail, and the dangerous symptoms increase, it is necessary to divide the sphincter ani, by means of a curved bistoury, and a director. Every prolapsus occasions a remaining weakness and re- laxation, in such pads, as retain the bowel in its natural position; and, for this reason, the complaint, when nog-

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. t useful, therefore, must the employment of external dis- cutient applications prove in cases where the extravasation of blood and lymph into.the interstices of the inflamed part, is exceedingly copious; hence, lotions containing sal ammoniac, in inflammations arising from contusions, concussions, and sprains, are generally more efficacious, than astringents and emollients. In such cases, when the inflammation is slight, and the swelling and extravasation considerable, even embrocations and liniments are prefer- able to any kind of lotion . One of the best discutient lotions is what is employed at St. Bartholomew’s hospital: R. ammon. muriatae ?fs. aceU et spirit, vin. rectif. sing. foj. M. Another very good one is composed of aq. ammon. acet. alone, or mixed with equal parts of spirits of wine, and distilled water. WARM APPLICATIONS. It is curious thaf inflammations should sometimes be be- nefited by cold local applications, and sometimes by warm emollient poultices and fomentations. As practice suffi- ciently confirms the truth of the observation, and theory might lead us into hypothesis, I conceive it will be no loss to the reader to omit all speculations on the subject. Al- though in the generality of cases cold astringent lotions are preferable to warm applications, yet it sometimes hap- pens that they do not have their usual good effect, either from the singularity of the patient’s constitution, or from the structure and situation of the inflamed part. Tne swelled testicle and the incipient stage ot acute ophthalniy receive more benefit from emollient fomentations and poul- tices, than from astringents. Inflammations, not admit- ting of a cure without suppuration, must be treated witli emollients, for the sooner the matter is formed the sooner the inflammation ends. The inflammation attending con- tused wounds, and the boil, is of this sort. That origi-

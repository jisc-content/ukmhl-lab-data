PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 251 tranches, returning from the delicate lamina of the con- junctiva, spread over the anteriour surface of the cornea. When this happens, a milky albuminous secretion begins to be superficially effused in the interspaces between the red streaks. The opaque specks, thus produced, may cover only a part, or the whole, of the cornea. The opacity of the cornea, sometimes occurring in vio- lent ophthalmies, is essentially different from the nebula, and arises from a deep extravasation of coagulating lymph into the cellular texture of the cornea, or irom an abscess between the layers of this membrane* TREATMENT OF THE NEBULA. Very active measures ought to be taken in the incipient state of the disease ; for though it may at first only occupy a small portion of the cornea, if left to itself it will conti- nue to extend towards the centre of this membrane; an«. the veins become more and more varicose, it will convert the delicate layer of the conjunctiva, spread over the sur- face of the cornea, into a dense, opaque film. The curative indications are, to make the varicose vessels recover their natural diameters ; and if that be impractica- ble, to cut off all communication between the trunks ot the most prominent varicose veins of the conjunctiva, and those on the cornea. The first plan is executed by using Ja- nin’s ointment, or the wig. hr/drarg. nitrat., together with astringent colly via. The second is accomplished by the excision of the fasciculus of varicose veins, just at the base of the opacity ; and the most convenient instruments arc, a very sharp pair of dissecting scissars, and the com- mon anatomical forceps. ALBUGO AND LEUCOMA. These are effects of severe acute ophthalmy, and consist of an extravasation of dense lymph into the very substance

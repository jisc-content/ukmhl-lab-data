59 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. from small vessels; but (hey ought never to be trusted when large arteries are concerned. The method of applying fluid applications of this kind is to dip lint in them, and place it on the bleeding surface. Compression is generally adopted at the same time. That cold air has a styptic property we have the most unequivocal proofs. We frequently tie, on the surface of a wound, every artery that betrays the least disposition to bleed, as long as the wound continues exposed to the air. We bring the opposite sides of this wound into contact, and nut, the patient to bed. Not an hour el apses before the renewal of hemorrhage necessitates us to remove the dressings. The wound is again exposed to the air, and again the bleeding ceases. I have often seen this happen in the scrotum after the removal of the testis. The proper conduct, in such cases, is not to open the wound unneces- sarily, but to apply wet linen to the part, so as to produce such evaporation from its surface as shall create a sutheient degree of cold to stop the bleeding. No styptic has the property of promoting the coagula- tion of the blood. All styptics create irritation on the surface of wounds, and scientific surgeons never apply them to such cases. They are, however, judiciously used to suppress bleedings from many diseased surfaces, where the vessels seem to have lost their natural disposition to contract. 8. PARTICUJ.AR REMARKS. When the bleeding vessel is ossified, or situated in a bony canal, a small dossil of lint, introduced into its ori- fice, will stop the effusion of blood. W hen an artery is cut aciv>ss, and only partly through its diameter, it generally bleeds more profusely than when quite divided. The reason of this is, because it can nei- ther shrink under the surrounding substance, nor contract jtself sufficiently to become impervious. Hence originated

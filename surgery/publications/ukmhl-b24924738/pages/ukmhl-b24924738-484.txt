first lines of the 442 seen in children.* The bladder is seldom found ruptured, unless a slough has previously occurred. " Sometimes, in consequence of the distended state of the bladder, no more uiiue can be transmitted into this recep- tacle. The lower terminations of the ureters arc mechani- cally shut, so that these tubes> and the pelvis of each kid- ney, become very enormously dilated with urine. Retention of urine is referrible to four principal causes ; 1. weakness, or paralysis of the bladder ; 2. inflammation of this viscuS, or of the adjacent parts.; 3. a spasmodic closure of the neck of the bladder, or urethra ; 4. and lastly, some obstruction in the passage. I v • RETENTION OF URINE FROM PARALYSES OF THE BLADJ)E II. In this case the passage for the urine is open ; but the bladder has not the power of contraction. The nature of the disorder is distinguished by the foregoing cause, and by the facility with which the catheter may be introduced. In persons of advanced age, the bladder becomes less sensible to the stimulus of the urine, and loses the power of contracting so completely as to expel the whole of its contents. This is the first degree of the retention of urine, common to'old subjects, and originating in a very gradual manner. The urine flows in a full, but a Aveak stream, and towards the end of every evacuation, the Avater only comes away in drops. The quantity of urine, expelled at a’time, becomes by degrees smaller and smaller, until a perfect retention occurs. This species of the disorder is often imputable to a perni- cious habit of not taking sufficient time completely to dis- charge the urine. Sometimes it. is owing to an injury done to the loins, and it. is then usually attended with a paralytic affection of the lower extremities. Most frequently, it is * One buck case 1 have seen myself.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 427 On account of the above reasons, and a conviction that strictures, occupying some extent of the passage, are far more common, than has been supposed, I think every sur- geon should endeavour to learn (before determining which sort of bougie he will use) whether the stricture is such a contraction as would originate from tying, a piece of packthread round the canal ; or whether it consists oi a more extensive diminution of the passage. Having ascertained that a common sized bougie will not pass beyond a particular point of the urethra, we ought to make an impression on the instrument with the nail, close- ly to the mouth of the urethra. Then the bougie should Iw* withdrawn, and the surgeon should take one of a smaller size, which he is to mark with his nail, exactly at the place corresponding to that of the impression on the first bougie. This smaller one is to be introduced so far as to bring its marked part exactly to the orifice of the urethra, at which period (lie surgeon knows that the extremity of the bougie has just arrived at the contraction, which would not allow the first common-sized bougie to pass. If the second bougie cannot be introduced further than t lie first, a still smaller one is to be tried ; but the surgeon should not have recourse to the smallest bougies at once, as the largest bougie that can be insimtated through the stricture ought to be the model of the soft white one, which should now be introduced for the purpose of shewing the shape and ex- tent of the stricture, by the impressions made upon it. If, after the soft bougie has remained a minute or two in the stricture, it should be marked with a distinct circular, or semicircular narrow furrow on being withdrawn, we have reason to believe that the stricture does not occupy much of the extent of the urethra. However, whether there is any gradual conical diminution of the passage, in front of the most contracted part of the stricture, may be known by considering, whether the situation of thefurrow, on the soft bougie, is exactly ^t the same distance from the

FIRST LINES OF TI1E 110 lchap. xxiii. POLYPI. A POLYPUS is a fleshy excrescence, growing- on it thin pedicle, which is named its root. As it may arise in many parts of the body, it seems proper to class it with general disorders. Although it is most frequently met with in the nose, uterus, vagina, rectum, meatus audito- rius extern us, and maxillary sinus, it may undoubtedly originate in other situations. Similar excrescences even grow from the surface of the skin itself. The polypus of the nose is the most frequent of all, and is principally of three kinds. 1. Sometimes the tumour is red, soft, and sensible, but free from pain, and, in every respect, like a piece of healthy flesh. This is named the fleshy polypus. It is the most common, and, fortunately, the most benign of all. 2. In other instances the swelling is hard, scirrhous, and painful, and is then denominated the malignant polypus. It is said to be even capable of con- version into carcinoma. It may cither be malignant from its very origin ,-or from being of a mild description at first, it may have subsequently assumed this unfavourable dis- position. 3. The third kind of polypus is properly named by Richter the polypus of the mucous membrane of the nostrils.* It is very tough ; its colour is pale; and there is a viscid secretion from its surface. At particular periods, and especially when the weather changes, it un- dcraoes an alteration of its size. In fact, the tumour con- sists of the mucous membrane of the nostrils, which is elongated at the part affected into the shape of a polypous * Iu German schlcimpolypc.

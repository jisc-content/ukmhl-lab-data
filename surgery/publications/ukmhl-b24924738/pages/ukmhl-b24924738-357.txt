PRACTICE OF SUkGERY. 315 tlie oesophagus, and occasionally febrile and convulsive symptoms come on. The consequences, however, are not invariably dangerous. Foreign bodies, especially when small anil pointed, very frequently excite suppuration, after which they become loose, and are eitlier carried into the stomach or rejected from the mouth. Sometimes they make their way towards the surface of the neck, occa- sioning abscesses there, out of which they may be ex- tracted. In some instances foreign bodies, especially such as needles, after making their way through the oesophagus, travel a great way about the body, and at length make their appearance at the surface of remote parts, behind the cars, at the shoulders, feet, &c. where they occasion au abscess, which leads to their discovery and extraction. In the memoirs of the Academy of Surgery, we have an ex- ample of a needle, which was swallowed, remaining in the body eighteen years before it made its appearance extei- nally. ^During most of the above space, not the slighest inconvenience was experienced. I think it superfluous to describe in this work oesopha- gotomy, an operation which few would ever venture to perform. By this remark, I do not mean, however, to assert that a case might not occur, in which a surgeon ought to make the attempt, especially when the foreign body is large, like an apple, and its situation is not too low- down.

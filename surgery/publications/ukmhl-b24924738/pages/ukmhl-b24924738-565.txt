PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 52J tached portion af the neck of he scapula, as high as the part, from which it is separated. FRACTURES OF THE STERNUM. These, when mere solutions of continuity, only require general treatment : viz. a piece of soap plaster ; a roller round the body ; quietude and antiphlogistic means, espe- cially bleeding. However, when a fracture of the sternum is attended with a depression of a portion of (lie bone, the urgent symp- toms, tlius produced, often require a prompt elevation of the part beaten inward. For (his purpose, an incision must generally be made in the integuments covering the bone, and, if the depressed portion of the fracture cannot be raised, by means of an elevator, it must be removed, ei'her with a trephine, or one of Mr. Hey’s saws, according to the same directions, as are «aven in the chapter on injuries of the head.

Fractures of the sternum are frequently attended with a train of very alarming symptoms ; great pain in the chest, oppressed respiration, a violent cough, palpitations of the heart, extravasation of blood in the chest, and danger of su(localion. Inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, lungs, and heart itself; suppuration in the anterior me- diastinum ; caries ot the bone, and fistulous openings, may follow these injuries. FRACTURES OF TIIE RIBS. I he first rib cannot very easily be broken, on account of its guarded situation, beneath the clavicle ; the lower false ribs are seldom fractured, because their moveable dis- position makes them elude the eftect of external violence. When the force is applied by a broad surface, more ribs than one are usually fractured. The injury is most com- monly situated near the greatest convexity of the bone. A

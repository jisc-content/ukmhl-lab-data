PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 293 conceal the iris, the pupil, and the instrument, from ihe operatorâ€™s view. The object now is to lacerate the capsule as much as possible. Both the fragments and the extra- vasation of the milky fluid in the two chambers of the aqueous humour are regularly absorbed after the opera- tion, so as to leave the eye in a transparent state. When the cataract is soft, the particles of which it is composed will frequently elude all efforts made with the needle to depress them. This, however, is quite unneces- sary. The operator may either be content with a tree la- ceration, and disturbance of them, or he may imitate Scarpa in pushing the fragments of the capsule, and the particles of caseous matter, into the anterior chamber. In this cavity absorption seems to be carried on with more a i- gour than behind the pupil. When the cataract is a secondary membranous one, the surgeon is to turn the point of the needle cautiously to- wards the pupil, and pierce the opaque capsule. I his is to be broken, as far as it is practicable, at every point ot its circumference; and the fragments may either be left in their situation, or pushed forward, through the pupil, into the anterior chamber, in t he way whicli Scarpa practises. When the capsule is adherent to the iris, it may often be separated by skilful and delicate movements of the needle. If the operator should prefer the straight needle, lie must be careful to depress (he cataract a little in the first instance, before making any attempt to place the instru- ment in front of the cataract, in order to be able to depress it, downward and backward, in the most convenient man- ner. As the point of a curved needle is turned backward, it may evidently be brought forward with more safety than a straight one, which has a tendency to rua directly against the iris. Whenever an operator prefers lacerating the front layer of the capsule, and pushing the particles of soft and membranous cataracts forward, he will accom-

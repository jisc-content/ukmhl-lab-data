FIRST LINES OF THE SCO hy the generality of persons to be an exceedingly common one, and the operation for its relief, is not totally exempt rom danger, it is highly necessary for every surgeon to now that, in infants, an incapacity to suck, in conse- quence of the evidently immoveable state of the ton<me caused by the above defects, forms the only just ground lor dividing the freeman. Ilence, before performing an operation, the surgeon s oukl not be satisfied with merely hearing that a child cannot suck; as this incapacity may be owing to other causes, particularly the large size of the nurseâ€™s nipple adhesions of the sides of the tongue to the inside of the mouth, &c. The practitioner ought to examine with his eyeS whether the frcenum extends to the apex of the tongue m an undue manner: a thing most easily ascertained, "as, in the natural state, about a quarter of an inch of the un- der surface of the tongue, from the apex backward, re- mains quite unconnected with the frcenum. When this part ties the tongue too closely to the bottom of the mouth, by reason of its shortness, the surgeon cannot raise the tongue towards the palate even with his own fingers. The operation consists in dividing the frcenum, as far as seems necessary; and it is so simple, as to require no par- ticular explanation. Tire best instrument for performing it is a pair of sharp scissars with blunt points. No more of the frcenum ought to be divided than is essential to the object in view; and pointed instruments should never lie employed. The situation of the raninal arteries renders this inculcation of the highest importance; for many chil- dren have lost their lives by these vessels having been un- skilfully wounded by careless or ignorant operators.

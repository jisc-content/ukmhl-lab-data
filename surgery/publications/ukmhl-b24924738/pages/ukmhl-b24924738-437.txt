395 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. testis and epididymis can be distinctly felt below the tu- mour quite independent of it. The upper part of the cord in the groin is usually very distinguishable. As Mr. Pott observes, it undergoes no alteration from change of posture, nor is it affected by coughing. The functions of the alimentary canal are not disturbed by it. Infants are much more subject to (his disease, than adults.' In the former, the fluid may often be dispersed by aperient medicines and fomentations. If it should not yield to this treatment, a small puncture, sufficient to evacuate the fluid, commonly produces a cure. In adults, it is some- times requisite to make an incision through the whole length of the tumour- Perhaps, it might be better to have recourse to the red wine injection, after discharging the fluidby means of a very small trocar. CUAP. XXXVI. H.'EMATOCELE. THIS signifies a swelling of (he scrotum, or spermatic cord, occasioned by blood. The disease is of four kinds, two of which have their -seat in the tunica vaginalis ; one within the albuginea, and the fourth in the membrane investing the spermatic vessels. J. In letting out the water of a hydrocele a vessel is sometimes wounded. Aflcr the operation the blood insi- nuates itself partly into the tunica vaginalis, and partly into the cellular substanceof the scrotum, so as to form, in a very short time, a tumour nearly equal in size to the original hydrocele. The blood colours the fluid of the hydrocele, when it is flowing through the cannula.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. CHAP. XXXIV. HERNLE. BY the term hernia, surgeons imply a preternatural tu- mour, occasioned by some of the viscera oi the abdomen <ru being displaced out of that cavity. The disease, in common language, is called a rupture ; and this appellation seems to have proceeded from an er- roneous idea formerly entertained, that the case was al- ways attended with laceration of the peritoneum. The moderns, with more accuracy, insist, that, in ordinary cases, there is only a dilated state of the parts, in which a hernia is included. The contents of a hernial tumour are usually, either a portion of intestine, or of omentum, and, not uncommonly, of both, at the same time. However, there is scarcely any viscus of the abdomen that has not been protruded in less common cases. When intestine alone is contained in the hernia, the case is termed an enterocele; when omentum alone, epiplocele; and when both are contained in the tumour, it is named an entero-epiplocele. When a hernia contains the stomach, liver, bladder, &c. it is sometimes named accordingly, gasirocele, hepatocele, and cystocele. Besides this division of hernias into several kinds, de- duced from the nature of their contents, there are other surgical distinctions, derived from their situations. Thus, when any of the contents of the abdomen slip through the abdominal ring into the groin, the case is termed a bubo7?o- cele, or inguinal hernia.; and w hen the parts descend lower into the scrotum, or labia pudendorum, the hernia is called

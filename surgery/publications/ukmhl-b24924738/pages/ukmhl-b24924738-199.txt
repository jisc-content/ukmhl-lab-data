When the pain is severe the patient usually finds relief on sitting, pulling off his tight shoes, placing his feet in a horizontal posture, and becoming cool. But the pain is thus not prevented from returning, when he again puts on his tight shoes and walks about. The pain may begot rid of for a somewhat longer period by cutting off the prominent portion of the corn, as far as it can be done, without exciting pain and bleeding, and by bathing the feet a few times in warm water. In order to cure corns radically the afflicted person must wear wide shoes, made of soft leather, and for a time must stand and walk as little as possible.

When the plaster has been applied some weeks, the corn commonly vanishes without any other means. Should the corn be in the sole of the foot, it is only necessary to put in the shoe a felt sole, in which there is a hole corresponding to the situation, size, and shape of the induration.

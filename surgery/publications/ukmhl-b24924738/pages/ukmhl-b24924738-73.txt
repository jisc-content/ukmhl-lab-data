I PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 43 should therefore be diminished. "W arm proof spirits or laudanum may be substituted for the alcohol, and the un- guent. resin, flavae is to be mixed with oleum camph. in- stead of turpentine. If this should be found too irrita- ting, he recommends ung. saturn. or the cerat. lap. cala- minaris. Powdered chalk is to be applied to repress the growth of exuberant granulations, and to absorb the redundant secre- tion. In the cavities of separated eschars, and in the furrows formed between sloughs and the living parts, Mr. Kentish introduces powdered chalk. Then a plaster is applied, and, in very tedious cases, a poultice over the plaster. The limits of this system do not afford room to enquire into the theory of the above practice. The principle is, not to allow the action, of a part that has been much ex- cited, to cease for want of stimulus, but to maintain 1 hat action by an adequate stimulus, which is to be gradually- diminished till the action returns to its ordinary state. This reasoning seems repugnant to all the received doc- trines of inflammation, and, in my mind, is illogical; but, as the corresponding practice has, irom ils unrival- led success, obtained almost general sanction, this is of little importance. Whoever prefers treating burns on the antiphlogistic plan, needs no further information, than what is contain- ed in the chapters on inflammation and its consequences. Burns in the neck are frequently followed by such a con- traction of the cicatrix, that the head becomes drawn to one side. This deformity may be lessened, though it can- not always be prevented, by position. i I \ )

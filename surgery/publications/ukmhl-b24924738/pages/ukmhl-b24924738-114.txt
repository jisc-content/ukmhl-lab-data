FI 11,ST LINES OF THE S2 are always attended with contusion and laceration, by which most commonly some of the fibres immediately Sur- rounding the wound are deadened, and must be thrown of? in the form of a slough before the wound can heal. Hence gunshot wounds rarely admit of being united by the ad- hesive inflammation ; and on this same account they sel- dom bleed profusely, except when very considerable blood vessels are wounded. 2. VELOCITY OP THE PROJECTED BODY. Besides the figure and magnitude of the body impelled into the living solids, the velocity with which it .moves has considerable influence. This wc arc assured of by finding, when a ball has passed with little velocity (which is ofien the case with balls at their entrance, but most commonly where they are near their exit), that the wounds may often be healed by the first intention. At the entrance of the ball the circumference is usually depressed; at its exit prominent. On account of the parts surrounding a gunshot wound, being often deadened, the nature of the injury cannot al- ways at first be comprehended. Some viscus, a part of some large artery, or even a bone,, may have been deaden- ed by the violence; but the mischief does not manifest it- self till the separation of the slough takes place. When the ball moves with little velocity, there is always less sloughing than when it has penetrated with rapidity. When the divided parts have not lime to yield to the di- viding body, they must of course be proportionally bruised. , If the velocity of the bail be great, the direction of the wound is mure likely to be straight. .j.

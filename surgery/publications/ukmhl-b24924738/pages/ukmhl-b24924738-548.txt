/ -5-06 FIRST LINES OF THE Convexity be about half an inch in front of (he joint, into â– which the surgeon intends to cut. The little flap is next to be raised, and reflected. Next the skin, in front of the fin- ger, and immediately over the joint, is to be divided, so that this second cut must extend across the finger, or toe, and meet the two ends of the first semilunar incision. The joint is now to be bent, and the capsular ligament opened. If the surgeon were to attempt to cut into the joint, with the finger, or toe, in a straight position, he might try a con- siderabletime before be would succeed. Things being ac- complished so far, the next object is to divide one of (he lateral ligaments, which, after an opening is made into the capsular ligament may be most easily effected. This al- lows the head of the bone to be dislocated, and the sur- geon has nothing more to do, than to cut such other parts, as still attach the part, about to be removed, to the rest of the limb. When the arteries'bleed much, they must be tied ; but, it frequently happens, that the hemorrhage will stop without a ligature, as soon as the flap is brought over the end of the stump, and the adhesive plaster has brought the edges of the wound accurately together. When it is necessary to remove the metatarsal bone of ' the great, or little, toe, it. is better to saw off the diseased portion, than to cut into the joints of the tarsus. Suffi- cient skin should be saved for covering the wound, and, wdien the saw is used, the adjoining soft parts must be dc.- fended from injury by a piece of pasteboard, placed be- tween them and the teeth of the instrument. When the thumb is to be amputated, a flap is, also, to be preserved for covering the end of the stump.

first lines of the Until very lately, it was the invariable practice to intro- duce the instrument at the central point of a line, drawn from the umbilicus to the anterior superior spinous process of the ns ilium, and on the left side, in order to avoid all risk of injuring the liver. Modern practitioners usually prefer making the punc- ture in the linea alba for several weighty reasons. The fiist is, that in the other method you are not sure of intro- ducing the instrument in the exact situation of the linea semilunaris, and consequently may unnecessarily wound the thick muscular parietes of the abdomen, instead of meiely a thin tendinous part. Another reason is, that the epigastric artery has sometimes been wounded by very skilful men, when they have attempted to tap in the linea semilunaris. In dropsical cases the rectus muscle is fre- quently much broader than in a healthy subject; and, as it always yields to the distention of the fluid in a greater proportion, than the lateral layers of muscles, the above mentioned measurement is very likely to cause the wound to be made near the course of the epigastric artery. When the operation is to be performed in the linea alba, the instrument should be introduced about two or three inches below the r>uYel. ' â€¢r- - J" As soon as the trocar meets with no further resistance, it is not to be pushed more deeply, without any object, and with a possibility of injuring the viscera. The stilette is now to be withdrawn, and the fluid allowed to escape through the cannula. In consequence of the sudden removal of the pressure of the fluid on the viscera and diaphragm, patients are very apt to swoon, and even become affected with very extraor- dinary and dangerous symptoms. To prevent these un- pleasant occurrences, the abdomen is to be compressed by a bandage, or belt, during the discharge of the fluid, and afterwards is to be covered with a flannel compress, and a roller, applied in rather a tight manner.

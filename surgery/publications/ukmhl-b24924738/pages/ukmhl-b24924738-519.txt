PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 477 case lifts lasted, tlie more difficult it is to icctiiy it, and tiie U)(3 danger ot tlic occurrence increases, d he greatest urgency arises from the retention of urine, and impedi- ment to the passage of the ioeces. The distention of the bladder and rectum must naturally render the reduction of the uterus more difficult. Sometimes abortion takes place, and this event has occasionally been known to be productive of relief. As the return of the uterus to its natural position is al- ways greatly facilitated by drawing off the urine with a catheter, this operation should be first performed. The uterus has often been known to resume its proper situation, on the bladder being emptied. So much difficulty has, sometimes, been experienced in introducing a catheter, in these cases, that some practitioners have been obliged to puncture the bladder. However, few, who know the way in which the urethra is displaced by a retrorcersio uteri, would find such a proceeding necessary. The rec- tum should, also, be emptied, if possible, by clysters. Reduction is accomplished by making pressure on the fundus uteri, with two fingers introduced into the rectum. The chief impediment to success arises from the projection of the sacrum. Hence, the pressure should be so directed, as to avoid forcing the uterus against this part. The operation should be accomplished, while the patient is kneeling, and leaning on her elbows ; for, in this position, the uterus becomes more distant from the sacrum. The fundus uteri should be pushed upward and forward, to- ward the navel. Sometimes it is preferable to make pres- sure with the fingers in the vagina.

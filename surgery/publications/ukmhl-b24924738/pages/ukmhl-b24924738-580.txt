533 FIRST LINES OF THE * Plate IX. bent, the muscles, forming the calf of the leg, and those, which pass behind the fibula, and under the os calcis, are, to use Mr. Pott’s expression, all put into a state of relaxa- tion, and non-resistance ; all the difficulty and trouble, in general, vanish immediately ; the foot may easily be placed right, the joint reduced, and, by observing the same posi- tion, every thing will commonly succeed. Mr. Pott’s pos- ture for a fractured leg and thigh, is represented in the an- nexed engraving.* Mr. Sharp’s splints, made of tin, instead of pasteboard, arc as good as any, which can be employed. They should always be of sufficient length, to extend from the condyles of the os femoris quite to the foot. The muscles being re- laxed by placing the limb in the position represented in the plate, the surgeon is to make such extension, as seems re- quisite for bringing the ends of the fracture into even appo- sition. Then he is carefully to raise the leg a little way from the surface of the bed, by taking firmly hold of the limb, below and above the fracture, and elevating the broken bones together in such a v ay, as shall keep both the upper and lower portions, as nearly as possible on the same level. At this moment, an assistant should put ex- actly under the leg the under splint, which has been pre- viously prepared, by covering iL w ith a soft pad, and lay- ing over this an eighteen-tailed bandage. The leg is now to be gently depressed, fill it becomes supported on the ap- paratus. The surgeon, before he proceeds further, should once more observe, that the ends of the bones are evenly in contact. Being assured of this important point, he is to apply a piece of soap plaster over the situation of the frac- ture, and lay down the tails of the bandage. Another soft pad, well filled with tow, is next to be put over the upper surface of the leg, and the other splint applied. The straps

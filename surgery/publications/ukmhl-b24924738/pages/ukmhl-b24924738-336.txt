I lie blade of the knife is now to be pressed slowly down- ward till it lias cut its way out, and divided a little more than half of the circle of the cornea. Though Mr. Ware considers the iris out of danger as soon as the knife has completed what he terms punctua- tion, the authority of Richter, who has had immense expe- rience in this branch of surgery, might be adduced to prove the contrary; and that if the aqueous humour be allowed to escape before the edge of the knife has begun to divide the lower lamina; of the cornea, the iris is still apt to fall for- ward, and be cut. Hence the author of the present volume requests the reader to be very particular in employing a knife which will regularly, as it is introduced, till the wound; which has a blade broad enough to divide the lower part of the cornea before its point has approached too near the * hose; and, lastly, which will effect this object by being merely pressed in a transverse direction, and without any previous escape of the aqueous humour. The incision of the cornea being accomplished, the next object is to divide the anterior layer of the capsule of the crystalline lens, in order to allow the opaque lens itself to escape. Wenzel, who, no doubt, was a man of uncom- mon dexterity, used to puncture the capsule with the point of the knife, at the same time that he was dividing the cornea. Mr. Ware has very properly discouraged this method, by stating that it is rather a work of dexterity than usefulness, and is ofen attended with much hazard of wounding the iris. Even the adroit Baron himself found it necessary, in particular cases, to divide the cornea first, and then open the capsule with a gold needle, made for the purpose. ' . Ihe exit of the opaque lens, in general, very readily fol- lows the division ot its capsule, on very gentle pressure be- ing made on the eye. If any fragments of opaque matter

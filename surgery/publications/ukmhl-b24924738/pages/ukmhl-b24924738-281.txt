Of this disease there are two kinds ; one, in which the inner lining of one or both eyelids has become adherent to the eyeball; the other, in which the two eyelids have ad- hered together at their edges, to a greater or less extent. This complaint is sometimes an original malformation ; but it is most frequently produced after birth by violent ophthalmies, burns, &c. When the edges of the eyelids have grown together, the preternatural connexion is to be divided with a bistoury, taking care not to wound the eye- bal. The cut surfaces are then to be kept asunder by the interposition of a suitable piece of lint, until they have healed. When the edges of the eyelids have grown toge- ther-m>m the outer to the inner canthus of the eye, it is of no use to separate them, when the cornea underneath is known to be perfectly opaque. Only in cases, where the adhesions betiveen <he eyelids and eyeball are loose, limited to a small extent, and not situated over the cornea, is it very practicable to do good by dividing them with a knife. Even in such instances it is frequently very difficult to prevent the adhesions forming again. The irritation of substances, interposed between the cut surfaces, is generally so great, that the surgeon is obliged to withdraw them. The only plan, which can then be followed, is to make the patient move his eyelids about, and to smear the cut surfaces every now and then with a little of the unguent , satumirmm by means of a hair pencil. ectropium. This disease for the most part affects the lower eyelid, which becomes everted towards the cheek, and does not apply itself to the eyeball.* Thus the inner lining of the palpcbra is turned outward, and the lower portion of the

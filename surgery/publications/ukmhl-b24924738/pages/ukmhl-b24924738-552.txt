510 FIRST LIKES OF THE Thus the return of blood through the vessel is prevented, consequently, it swells, becomes conspicuous, ar.d bleeds freely, which it would not do, if the blood could readily pass on towards the heart. In bleeding in the arm, a fillet, or bandage, is to be tied, with moderate tightness, round the arm, a little above the elbow. The design of doing this, is to intercept the pas- sage of the blood through all the superficial veins, without obstructing the circulation through the artery, as, in this circumstance, the veins evidently could not be rendered turgid. The surgeon, before putting a ligature round the arm, should always feel where (he pulsation of the artery is si- tuated, and, if equally convenient, he should not open the vein immediately over this part. It is also proper to exa- mine where a pulsation is situated, on account of the occa- sional varieties in the distribution of the arteries of the arm. The ulnar artery is sometimes given off from the brachial high up, and, in this case, it frequently proceeds superficially over the muscles, arising from the internal condyle, instead of diving under them, in the ordinary manner. , , In general, it is best to select a vein, which rolls least under the skin. Such a vessel, though sometimes not so superficial as another, may commonly be more easily open- ed, than the latter. However, the operator is always to fix the vein, as much as he can, by placing the thumb of his left hand a little below the place, where he intends to intro- duce the lancet. More depends on the mode of using this instrument, than on its shape. It should be pushed into the vein in an ob- lique direction, and, when its point is a little within the cavity of the vessel, it is not to be introduced turther, but the opening is to be rendered sufficiently large by carrying the front edge of the lancet obliquely forward and upward, by which movement, it is also brought out of the part

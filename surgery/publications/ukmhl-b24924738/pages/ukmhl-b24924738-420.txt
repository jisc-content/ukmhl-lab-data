FIRST LINES OF THE 378 When the stricture is produced by the .abdominal rin^, the above gentleman recommends the surgeon to pass his finger into the sac, as far as the stricture, and then to convey a probe pointed bistoury, over the front part of the sac, into the ring, -which is next to be divided, in a di- rection upward, opposite the middle of the neck of the sac, and to an extent just sufficient to allow the protruded parts to be returned into the abdomen, without hurtinV them in the act of doing so. The chief advantages of dividing the ring upward, de- pend first on the fabric of tills aperture not being so much weakened as it would be by cutting upward and outward, 60 as to divide the transverse tendinous fibres, which cross its upper part; and, secondly, on the safety of the me-i thod, in regard to the epigastric artery. However, Mr. A. Cooper has explained, that a frequent situation of the stricture is not at the abdominal ring, but at the place where the sac opens into the abdomen ; that is, an inch and a half, or tw'O inches, towards the anterior su- perior spinous process of the ilium from the ring. Here the strangulation is caused by the transversalis muscle and its tendon, which pass over the hernial sac, in a semicir- cular direction, and by a fascia arising from Poupartâ€™s li- gament, the semicircular border of which passes under the sac. In this case the surgeon must introduce his finger in'o the sac, through the abdominal ring, as.far as the stric- ture, and then the probe-pointed bistoury, with the flat part of its blade turned towards the finger, is to be insi- nuated between the front of the sac and the abdominal ring, till it arrives under the stricture, formed by the lower edge of the transversalis and obliquus intern us. Then the edge of the instrument is to be turned forward, and the stricture cut in the direction upward, by which method the epigastrip artery pan scarcely be cut, whatever be its situa*

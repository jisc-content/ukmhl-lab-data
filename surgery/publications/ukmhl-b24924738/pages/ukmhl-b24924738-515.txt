473 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. â€¢concussions of the body; but we can hardly conceive, that such circumstances would be adequate to the produc- tion of the case, if the vagina, and parts, retaining the uterus in its situation, were not greatly relaxed. There are two indications in the treatment : viz. to reduce the uterus into its natural position ; and to prevent its descending again. The first object is, in general, very easy of accomplishment, when the prolapsus is incomplete. The second is effected by making the patient wear a pes- sary in the vagina, and use corroborant astringent injec- tions. The reduction of a complete prolapsus, of long stand- ing, is sometime difficult. The operation should be done before the patient gets out of bed in the morning. It is sometimes of use to empty the large intestines, by a clys- ter, before a Tempting reduction. However, the thicken- ing of the prolapsed viscus, and the alteration made in the position of the surrounding parts, in some instances, ren- der the design quite impracticable. In this circumstance we must be content with drawing off the urine with a catheter, if requisite, and supporting the part with a bandage. The presence of ulcerations is no reason for not attempt- ing to reduce the displaced part. When the tumour is very much inflamed and swollen, it is sometimes advisable to defer the attempt to replace the uterus, until bleeding, the application of cold washes, &c. have diminished the above state. In recent cases of prolapsus uteri, we may hope to effect a radical cure by bringing the relaxed and dilated parts into another state. This may be accomplished by intro- ducing into the vagina, immediately the uterus has been reduced, a sponge, which is to be frequently vetted with some astringent lotion. A compress, supported by the T bandage, is, also, to be applied to the external parts of generation. The patient must remain in a horizontal I

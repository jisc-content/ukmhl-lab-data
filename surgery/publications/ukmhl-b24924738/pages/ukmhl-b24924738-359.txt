PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 317 into the trachea, and as the operation is quite simple, and free from danger, the line of conduct for the surgeon is obvious beyond the shadow of a doubt, and he who is too timid, or irresolute to act with decision in such cases, ouo-ht to be stigmatized, as destitute of such qualities as are essential to a practical surgeon. The incision is usually made between two of the rings of the trachea, and of suf- ficient size to admit the introduction of a short silver can- nula, through which the patient is to breathe. In France an opening has been made info the larynx, between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, for the purpose of introducing the cannula. As Richter observes, though this plan can be followed without wounding any part of importance, it is difficult to conceive what advantage it possesses over the common method ; indeed, as the larynx is a much more irritable part than the trachea, one must infer, that it is generally better to make the incision in the latter part. The last kind of case, for which tracheotomy is indicat- ed, is when any foreign body has accidentally fallen into the trachea, through the rima glottidis. This is a very dan- gerous sort of accident, and frequently produces almost in- stantaneous suffocation. As the catastrophe sometimes happens, even when the extraneous substance is small, compared with the diameter of the trachea, we must con- clude, that suffocation is often not so much the consequence of that tube being completely obstructed in a mechanical manner, as by the spasmodic contraction which it under- goes, in consequence of the presence of the foreign body. When urgent symptoms exist, or when a person has only been suffocated a very few minutes in this manner, it is the duty of the surgeon to make an immediate incision into the trachea, and with the aid of a narrow pair of for- ceps to endeavour to extract the extraneous body. I have known several instances of children being suddenly suf- focated by this kind of accident: one was brought to my

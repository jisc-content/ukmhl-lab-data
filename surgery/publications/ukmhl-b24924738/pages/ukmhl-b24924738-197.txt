PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 163 CHAP. XXXI. ' ' ' .. \ WARTS AND CORNS. WARTS are small cutaneous excrescences, which oc- cur on all parts of the body, but chiefly on the face and hands. They arc generally hard and free from pain, and are cither connected with the skin by a slender pedicle, or by abroad base. The skin beneath the wart is in general moveable, and may be easily elevated, but sometimes it is attached to the parts below. Young people are more sub- ject to these excrescences than those who are advanced in age. Warts seldom attain any very considerable size; the largest seldom exceed the size of a pea, nor are they often troublesome, though sometimes they become pain- ful, and produce, especially when rubbed or scratched, very unpleasant ulcerations. Such irritable warts are commonly from the first of a red, or livid colour, and are usually situated on the face. Verrucas frequently occur on the penis, labia pudendi, and about the anus, and in such situations are frequently suspected to arise from a syphilitic cause. They may certainly be sometimes removed by tedious salivation ^ but, as they yield to the same remedies as cure common warts, we have no reason to believe that they have a ve- nereal origin. These kinds of warts are the largest which we see in practice. Numerous local remedies of a stimulating quality will cure warts. Only a few can here be noticed. Aqua am* monise and tinct. canthar. are good applications ;*the warts should be frequently moistened with one of them every day. > m 2

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 569 the fever is considerable, venesection should be practised, and opium exhibited. Brandy, spirit of wine, or vinegar, are as good topical applications as can be mentioned. Let it be remembered, however, that such treatment is only proper for preventing matter from accumulating, and that, when fluid is already collected, the indication is to make an immediate opening for its discharge. The inci- sion should always be sufficiently large to allow the matter to escape in a ready manner. The surgeon should not wait for whitlows to point; the matter will spread very extensively within the tendinous thecas, and soon induce a carious affection of the bones, if the practitioner should im- prudently waft for a pointing to occur. On an opening being made into the collection of fluid, a director should be introduced, and the wound enlarged by cutting upon this instrument. A simple pledget will be a better dress- ing than poultices. When there is only one phalanx in a carious state, and when this one bone is much diseased, some practitioners deem it more advisable to enlarge the wound sufficiently to allow the part to be dissected out, than to wait for the completion of tedious exfoliations.

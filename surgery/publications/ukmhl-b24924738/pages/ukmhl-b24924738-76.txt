A chilblain in the mild state is a moderately red tumour, occasioning heat and itching. The complaint after a time spontaneously disappears. In a more severe state, the tumour is larger, redder, and sometimes of a dark blue colour. The heat, itching, and pain are so vehement, that the patient cannot use the part affected. In the third degree, small vesicles arise on the tumour. These burst, leaving excoriations, which soon change into sores. The ulcers secrete a thin matter, penetrate deeply, arid arc very slow in healing. In the worst cases of chilblains, the inflammation ends in mortification, which is often preceded by the formation of bloody vesicles on the tumour. CAUSES. The sudden warming of a cold part, and the sudden cooling of a heated part, seem particularly conducive to chilblains; hence, parts most exposed to the vicissitudes of heat and cold, are most subject to the complaint; as, for instance, the toes, fingers, nose, ears, and lips. When a part is exposed to sudden cold, while it is in a state of perspiration, it is more likely to be affected with chilblains, than when'thus exposed while simply warm. The most intense cold alone cannot produce true chilblains, though analogous complaints do remain in limbs that have been frozen. The more irritable and tender the skin is, the more readily the complaint arises. Children, especially such as are subject to scro'phula, young persons, females, and alt who are brought up tenderly, who keep themselves warm,

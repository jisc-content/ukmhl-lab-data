flRST LINES OF TIIE I It is also proper (o make the opening in a depending situation, if practicable, in order to allow the matter to escape as soon as it is formed. Collections of matter, beneath the fascias of the fore-arm and thigh, particularly demand attention to this direction, as they common* Iy point, where those ligamentous bands are naturally extenuated, not where the matter can most readily es- cape. When an abscess bursts spontaneously, the opening is not likely to heal, as long as it communicates with a cavity into which pus is secreted ; and consequently there is no occasion to take any measures to prevent its closing. But A\hen a collection of matter is deeply situated, and has been opened by an incision, the wound is very likely to close again, especially if not in a depending situation. In this case the surgeon must.take care to insinuate a piece of lint between the edges of thfe puncture, and he ought at every visit to introduce a probe through its track. Very large collections of matter require a small opening. When extensively opened, violent inflammation invades the cyst, and the constitution is thrown into the most se- vere and often fatal derangement. This subject will be better understood when the lumbar abscess has been consi- dered. Some abscesses do not heal, though .the matter may easily find its way out ; for their internal surfaces will not form granulations unless a complete denudation of them be made, and fresh inflammation be excited. Abscesses about the anus, axillae, groins, scrotum, and labia piule/t- dvnmiy are of this kind. It is true, however, that such cases arc often prevented from getting well by the cavity of the abscess not. having a very direct external communi- cation. The curved bistoury and director are the instruments generally used for enlarging the opening of an abscess.

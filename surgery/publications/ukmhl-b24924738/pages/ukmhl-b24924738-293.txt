But should the fact be indis- putably established, it would proven very sympathetic connexion between the urethra and organs of vision ; but not any metastasis. The treatment of purulent ophthalmies, from what cause soever they may arise, consists, at first, in adopting anti- phlogistic means, applying emollient remedies to the eyes, and a blister to the temple, or nape of (he neck. The eyes may be frequently fomented with a decoction of white poppy heads, and warm milk may be repeatedly injected beneath the eyelids. To prevent the palpebra; from ad- hering together, the spermaceti cera(e may be smeared upon the edge of each tarsus every night at bed time.

However, when we speak of chronic ophthalmy, we generally mean the dis- ease as it appears in a very protracted state. s

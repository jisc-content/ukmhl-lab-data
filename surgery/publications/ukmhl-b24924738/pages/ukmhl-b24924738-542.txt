500 FIRST LINES OF THE The skin and muscles are now to be placed over the bone, in such a direction, that the wound shall appear only a line, across the face of the stump, with the angles at each side, from which points, the ligatures arc to be left out, as their vicinity to either angle directs. The skin is now commonly supported in this position, by long strips of adhesive plaster, applied from below upwards, across the face of the stump. Over these, and the ends of the li- gatures, it is best to place some pieces of lint, spread with the unguent, sperm, cet., to keep them from sticking, which becomes an exceedingly troublesome circumstance, when the dressings are to be removed. I am decidedly averse to the general plan of loading the stump with a large mass of plasters, pledgets, compresses, flannels, &c. I see no reason why the strips of adhesive plaster and a pledget of simple ointment should not suffice, when sup- ported by two cross bandages and a common linen roller, applied in a spiral way round the limb, from above down- ward. The first* turn of the roller, indeed, should go round the patientâ€™s body. Two cross bandages are to be put over the end of the stump. I conceive, that the elastic woollen cap, commonly placed over all the bandages and dressings, if not put on with a great deal of care, has a tendency to push the skin backward from the extremity of the stump, and, as it must also heat the part very much, I think its employ- ment might very properly be discontinued. After the operation the stump should rost upon a pillow of very moderate thickness; for bending the thighbone too much causes a retraction of the flexor muscles. If possible, the dressings should never be removed be- fore the third day ; but, in general, it is quite soon enough to change them on the fourth. At the end of"five or six days, the surgeon may begin to try, in a very gentle manner, whether any of the ligatures are loose. However, he should not use the smallest force,

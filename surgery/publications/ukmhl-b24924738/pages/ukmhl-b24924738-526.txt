'484 FIRST LINES OF THE blades a little, is to shut them, so as to grasp it. Cer- tainly, it is much more scientific to use the forceps, at first., merely to ascertain the position of the stone; for, when this is known, the operator is much more able to grasp the extraneous body, in a skilful manner, than if lie were to open the blades of the instrument immediately, without knowing where they ought next to be placed, or when shut. No man can duubt, that the injury, which the bladder frequently suffers, from reiterated and awkward movements of the forceps, is not au uncommon cause of such inflammation of this viscus, as is too apt to extend to the peritoneum, and occasion death. When the stone is found to be so large, that it cannot be extracted from the wound, without violence and lacera- tion, the surgeon may either break the stone wilh a strong pair of forceps, w'ith teeth constructed for (he purpose; or he may enlarge the wound with a probe-pointed curved bistoury, introduced under the guidance of the fore finger of the left hand., If the latter plan were very practicable, and sholiM seem likely to enable the surgeon to remove the stone with a due degree of ease, it seems preferable to breaking the stone, which is an exceedingly unpleasant circumstance, as it creates such a chance of calculous fragments remaining behind. If the operator, however, cannot safely extract the stone, by dilating the wound, he certainly ought to prefer breaking the extraneous body, to employing un- warrantable force in extracting it. When this has been done, and as many of the broken pieces have been taken out as the forceps can discover, the surgeon should introduce his finger, in order to feel whe- ther any fragments still remain behind. If they should do so, his best plan, provided they arc very small, is to inject lukewarm water, with moderate force into the wound, for the purpose of washing them out. The operator ought always to examine a stone, as soon

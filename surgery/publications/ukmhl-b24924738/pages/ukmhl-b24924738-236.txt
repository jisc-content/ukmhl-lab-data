202 FIRST LINKS OF THE i gradually becomes vascular ; and as its vessels acquire the power ot depositing earthy matter, it is ultimately con- verted into new bone, termed callus, which becomes the bond of union between the two portions of the fractured bone. In order that the first connecting substance may speedily become organised, and fitted for the formation of callus, no- thing is so favourable as perfect quietude. Hence the chief surgical indication in (lie treatment of fractures, after the ends of the bones, are replaced, is to keep them perfectly motionless : nature completes the rest. .Different bones re- quire different lengths of time to become firmly united ; the ribs and clavicle unite as soon as any; the os brachii is commonly tolerably firm in five weeks ; but the bones of the leg and the os femoris seldom become per- fectly strong in less than six weeks. These calculations refer, however, to adults'; for in children fractures are cured much more quickly than in grown up persons. The more vascular the bone's are, the sooner is the union of their fractures accomplished. GENERAL PRINCIPLES IN THE TREATMENT OP FRAC- TURES. Relaxation of such muscles as have the power to dis- place the ends of a fractured bone, extremely facilitates the reduction. A proper position is, indeed, the first thing to be attended to in almost all cases, in which the broken extremities of the bone are not in even contact. The muscles are the powers which cause the displaced condi- tion of the fracture, by drawing that end of the bone which is most moveable, out of its proper position in regard to that which is most fixed. Hence, in the extremities, the lower ends of fractures are those which are truly displaced by being drawn upward, or to one side, by the action of ' certain muscles, which have their origin and insertions both above and below the situation of the breach of conti-

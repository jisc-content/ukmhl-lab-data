In short,^hemorrhage may be said to be always produced by ulceration, except in a few in- stances, in which the ligature comes away after remaining applied the usual time, but still the sides of the vessel from sonie unknown cause have had no disposition to grow to- gether. Mr. Abernethy has rendered surgeons more confident in the success of operations for popliteal aneurisms by his bold, yet judicious attempts, to relieve aneurisms situated in the groin. Thrice has he tied the external iliac artery, and established the fact, that the inosculations, even in such ' a high situation as this, are quite sufficient for conveying a due quantity of blood into the limb beloW. By his last attempt he preserved the life of a person, w ho would cer- tainly have been in the grave in a very short time by the rupture of the tumour. A similar operation was done with success about the same time at Birmingham. The plan of doing it is simple, and consists in making an incision about three inches in length through the inte- guments of the abdomen, a little above Poupartâ€™s ligament, and half an inch on the outside of the abdominal ring, in order to avoid the epigastric artery. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is then to be divided in the di- rection of the wound. The lower margin of the internal oblique and transverse muscles is also to be cut with a crooked bistoury. The finger may then be passed be- tween the peritoneum, by the side of the psoas muscle, so as to touch the artery. A double ligature is to be carried under the vessel, and tied as in the operation for the popli- teal aneurism. In operating for an aneurism at the bend of the arm, an incision is to be made through the integuments covering the tumour ; then the fascia of the biceps muscle is to be divided, and the artery tied both above and below the swelling. Here two ligatures arc indispensable; for, if

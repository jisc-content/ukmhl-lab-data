PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 175 In others a small pimple precedes the formation of the ul- cer. Then a thickening of the part takes place; and while this effect remains altogether specific, it is very cir- cumscribed, and its edge terminates rather abruptly. The base of a chancre is hard, and its margin somewhat promi- nent. Sores of this description, situated on the glans, gometimes cause profuse bleeding. In women chancres are usually situated on the labia, or nymphae; sometimes on the perineum, but very rarely in the vagina. TREATMENT OF CHANCRES. Chancres admit of two modes of treatment; 1. to de- stroy them with escharotics, or remove them with the knife ; 2. to overcome the venereal irritation by means of the specific remedy for that poison. By the first method the chancre is reduced to the state of a common sore or wound, and heals up as such. This can only be done on the first appearance of the chancre, when the surrounding parts are not yet contaminated. If the sore be on the glans, touching it with the argentum ni- tratum is preferable to an incision, because the hemorrhage in the latter way would be troublesome. But as in most cases it is uncertain whether absorption has taken place, this practice is not entitled to much confi- dence, even when tire chancre has been destroyed on its first appearance; and it is generally right to give mercury internally. The best dressings for chancres are unguent, hydrarg., or a solution of cuprum, or zincum vitriolat. The modes of giving mercury internally \vill be pre- sently considered. It is here necessary to state that chancres are often in- fluenced in their progress by constitutional causes. In ir- ritable, weak habits, even after the venereal quality of the sores is destroyed by mercury, tire ulceration may conti- nue to spread, or extensive sloughs may form. -The foul

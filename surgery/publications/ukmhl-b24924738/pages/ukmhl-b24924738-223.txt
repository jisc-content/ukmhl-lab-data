PRACTICE OF SURGERY. »S§ ed by Ibis application; but I cannot say that I have ever known one example, in which a perfect cure was accom- plished by it. Sea-air and sea-bathing undoubtedly have very powerful elfects on scrophulous alFections in general, and most particularly so on such diseases, when situated in the joints. With respect to electricity, I believe it is of no use in these diseases; in a tew instances, it is true, it has seemed to do good ; but in others, according to my own judg- ment, it rather exasperated than diminished the disorder. Fomentations and poultices I consider perfectly inert, and quite unworthy the praises which some writers be- stow on them. The only method of treatment which my own personal experience enables me to recommend, consists in keeping up a continual discharge of pus trom the surface of the joint. In these cases I am rather inclined to prefer blisters to issues, as being more efficacious; but when blisters some- times create much irritation all over the joint, a caustic issue is to be preferred. The blister should be large, and the excoriated surface dressed with savin cerate. Some practitioners recommend blistering first one side of the joint, then the other alternately for a considerable time. Thus while one blister is healing, the other is forming. This method is said to be attended with considerable suc- cess. Caustic issues are usually made on each side of the joint, and in knee cases they are commonly as large as halt-crowns.

Disease of the hip joint is most commonly met with in children uader the age of fourteen; but no age is exempt

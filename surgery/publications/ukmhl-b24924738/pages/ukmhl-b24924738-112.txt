80 FIRST LINES OF THE gularly the case. I remember a man who was dreadfully burnt over the greater part of his body, in consequence of which he had extensive sores, occupying nearly the whole surface of some of his limbs. When these ulcers had con- siderably diminished, the power of producing skin seemed to lessen at the edges, but, at the same time, new portions of skin made their appearance at various parts of these ulcers, standing (as Mr. Hunter ingeniously describes) upon the surface of the granulations like little islands. ■ Mr. Hunter was of opinion that this production of skin, in the centre of sores, never happened the first time of their being sores. In the patient just mentioned, whom I saw in Mr. Ramsden’s private practice, and attended along while, the contrary fact took place. In general, the surrounding skin seems to communicate the disposition to the surfaces of the adjoining granula- tions to form skin ; just as bones give an ossifying dispo- sition to granulations formed upon them. The new formed cutis is neither so yielding, nor so elastic, as the original. It is also less moveable, and des- titute of the furrows observable on the old skin. At first it is extremely full of vessels ; but afterwards both it and the granulations beneath become free from visible vessels, and therefore whi'e. The surrounding old skin is puck- ered into loose folds, while the new constantly retains a stretched, shining appearance. The production of cuticle from the new cutis is a much easier process than the generation of skin. The formation of skin is chiefly progressive from the surrounding cutis ; but the cuticle is frequently formed at once, equally from every point of the cutis. The rete mucosum is not so readily formed as the cuti- cle ; for in blacks a cicatrix remains whitish a consider- able time, and sometimes even throughout life.

160 FIRST LINES OF THE When the distended vein is filled up with coagulutn, the circulation ot blood cannot go on through it, or at least but very imperfectly, and this fluid then accumulates below the varix, and dilates the contiguous branches. Thus the disease is increased', and frequently the veins are rendered varicose over the greater part of the leg. While the distention is trivial it occasions little incon- venience, but as it increases it is attended with a trouble- some and almost insupportable itching, and sometimes with very violent pain and inflammation. In the latter case suppuration may be the consequence. The matter is always at first contained in the cellular substance sur- rounding the varix, and is often the forerunner of very ob- stinate ulcerations. Varicose veins often burst when accidentally and sud- denly distended, or when pressed or scratched. In this circumstance a great deal of blood may be lost if care be not taken to stop the hemorrhage. AVer bleeding in this manner the varix seems to undergo a diminution, but this is olily temporary. There are two indications in the cure of varices, viz. to remove every impediment to the free return of the blood, and to restore the distended vessel to its former dimen- sions. Any tumour pressing upon the trunk of the vari- cose veins, should, if possible, be removed ; and wdien practicable, the limb kept in an horizontal posture. When, the cause of the impediment to the return of the blood can- not be removed, the cure is difficult to accomplish. Preg- nant ay omen cannot be cured of the complaint till after de- livery. Astringent cold applications are the most efficacious in promoting the diminution in the diameter of the dilated veins. Cold water, ice, snow, brandy, or a solution of alum in vinegar, should be used topically, while at the same time a bandage should be applied round the limb with a proper degree of tightness. It seems probable, that

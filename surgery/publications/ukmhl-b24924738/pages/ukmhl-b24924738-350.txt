In this way there can be no risk of wound- mg the latter considerable vessel, nor of tying the eighth pair of nerves. ° a 1 he primary brandies of the external carotid, viz. the ex rnal maxillary, the lingual, and the thyroideal arte- ries, are the most frequently injured in wounds of the neck. 1 ersons, who attempt to commit suicide, usually make ieir incision too high toendanger the carotid artery. WOUNDS OF THE TRACHEA. Wonnds of,!hal part of the trachea which is within the chest are sometimes followed by emphysema, arising from he diffusion of a,r through the adjoining cellular subs- ance. uch -wounds are also very dangerous, because they arc of the punctured kind, and generally injur, other important parts at the same time. Wounds of the larynx commonly produce more irrita- tion than those of the trachea. A convulsive cough is par- ticularly often attendant, on them, in fact the larynx is a much more sensible part than the windpipe. W ounds above the os hy aides penetrate the mouth, and are usually attended with profuse hemorrhage. Air, sa- liva, and victuals, arc apt to be discharged from them. In most cases, wounds of the thyroid cartilage heal veiy favourably, unless other parts ol consequence are also injured. Transverse wounds of the upper part of the trachea ge- nerally do well, when only its anterior half is divided. Such injuries generally leave nerves and vessels of conse- quence untouched. Loss of the voice ; the entrance and <*xit ot air through the wound ; and sometimes an emphy- sematous swelling of the integuments ; are the speedy con- sequences ot the injury. „ Wounds of this description, made by gunshot violence, are more dangerous ; but even these not unirequeutly terminate well.

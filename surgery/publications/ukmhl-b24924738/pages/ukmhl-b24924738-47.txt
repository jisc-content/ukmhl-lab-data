PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 17 QUALITIES OF pus. Pus consists of globules swimming in a fluid, which dif- fers from every other animal secretion, in being coagula- ble by the muriate of ammonia. The colour, which is or- dinarily a light yellow, is imparted to pus by the glo- bules. The fluid part resembles serum, and like it, is coagulable by heat 5 but it cannot, like milk, be coagu- lated by the gastric juice of animals. Healthy pus has little smell, is void of acrimony, and is of the consistence ofcream, ilsglobulesareabundant, and of a lightish colour. When pure, it docs not readily putrify ; but this quality is lost, when there are extraneous additions blended with the matter. In specific diseases, cases of caries, &c. the matter is often mixed with blood, coagulating lymph, &c. and then it has more tendency to putriry and become offensive. Pus always partakes of the nature of the sore, which produces it. To the surface secreting it, pus is quite unirritating, though it may greatly irritate any other, lienee it is useless to wipe matter so completely from the surface of granulations, as some are wont to do; but it is highly proper to keep the surrounding skin free from it. When any disease attacks the suppurating surface, or the constitution, the pus becomes thinner, more transpa- rent, more disposed to putrify, and become fetid. Sanies is the term frequently given to pus in this degenerated state. Sanies may be very irritating to parts, so as to cause their absorption ; but it never has the power of corroding them. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PTJS AND MUCUS. Secretions of another kind, sometimes, have a resem- blance to pus. The following circumstances form a line of distinction. Pus sinks in water ; mucus floats. Pus communicates to water an uniformly troubled white co- lour : mucus gives the appearance of stringy portions floating in it. Mucus is more readily dissolved by sulphu- v. c I

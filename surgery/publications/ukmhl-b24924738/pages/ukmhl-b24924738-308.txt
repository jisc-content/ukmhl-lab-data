The eyelids cannot be closed ; the exposure of the eyeball to the con- tact of the'air. and extraneous matter suspended in it; the friction of the eyelashes against the tumour ; the incessant Hux of tears down the subjacent check; render the eye painful and inflamed ; sympathetically induce ophthalmy in the sound one ; and cause ulceration both on the dis- eased part of the eye, and on the lower eyelid and cheek. TREATMENT OF STAPHYLOMA. 9 ' The opacity being irremediable, the only surgical object is to prevent the inconveniences arising from the protuber- ance of the diseased cornea. In recent cases, when the tumoui does not project forward, it is best to do nothing. In inveterate cases the prominent part of the cornea must be cut olf. Scarpa recommends doing the operation as far from die conjunctiva as the case will allow. This eminent practitioner introduces such a knife as is used in extrac- tion of the cataract, completely across the staphyloma, at the distance 01 one line and a half, or two lines from the centre of the tumour. The lower half of the prominence is to be detached by pushing the knife onward, till its edge comes out through the membrane below ; then the flap is to be turned up with a. pair of forceps, and the incision rendered completely cir- cular with the same bistoury. The aqueous humour,, crystalline lens1, and some of the vitreous, humour usually escape immediately after the operation, and the.eye conse- quently becomes so diminished as. to allow the eyelids to be shut. Qphfhalmy and suppuration succeed, i molliout poultices are to be applied, until the violence of the inflam- mation has a,bated, the quantify of matter diminished, and the wound betrayed a disposition to heal.

Surgical writers are certainly right when they inculcate, that the patient should refrain from making forcible ex- pirations, and drawing the head suddenly backward, fora certain time after the wound is healed. By such causes the recent coalescence of the wound may be easily de- stroyed. W hen a wound has detached the upper portion of the trachea from the lower one, and it is not immediately fatal by the injury of other important parts, the bleeding vessels are first to be tied, and the two ends are then to be brought into contact. In this sort of case I think that the employment of a suture is warrantable, on account of the immense separation of the divided parts, and the inef- ficacy of position alone to prevent it. A flat broadish li- gature should be employed, and the needle should not be introduced through the lining of the trachea.

Ihe inevitable injury of other important parts, at the same time, would render such a case at once mortal.

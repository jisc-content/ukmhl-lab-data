400 FIRST LINES OF THE Though this seems to be judicious practice,-when the or- ganization of a considerable part of the testicle is hot to- tally subverted by disease, and particularly when the fun- gus grows entirely from the tunica albuginea; yet if the whole substance of the testicle were so diseased, that the part would still be an useless and troublesome mass, though Ae fungus were removed, the surgeon ought undoubtedly to perform castration. It frequently happens, that the tunica vaginalis becomes very much thickened, indurated, and even cartilaginous, at the same time that its cavity is filled with fluid. The feel of the tumour is very apt to deceive the surgeon, and to make him suppose the case to be a hydro-sarcocele, while, in fact, the testis itself is perfectly sound. I have seen several preparations of this disease in anatomical mu- seums, and, in general, the parts had been injudiciously removed by castration. This is one kind of hydrocele, for which the radical cure by an incision is the best; because the surgeon is thereby enabled to cut away the hardened tunica vaginalis, and to ascertain with his own eyes the actual state of the testicle. o 1 • CHAP.

CASTRATION. - THE incision should commence a little above the place where the operator purposes to divide the spermatic cord, and it should be continued nearly to the bottom of the tu- mour. The generality of surgeons next make a short inci- sion on each side of the place where they intend to divide the cord, in order to detach this part from the adjoining fat, a«nd to be able to put their finger under it. This being

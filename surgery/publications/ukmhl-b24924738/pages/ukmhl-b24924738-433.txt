301 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. droccle is at once practised, the succeeding pain and in- flammatory symptoms often rnn to an unnecessary height. From the above account of the disease it must be clear, that the proper place for introducing the trocar is at the anterior and lower part of the tumour, this spot being commonly the most remote from the testicle. A small piece of soap plaster should be put on the punc- ture, and a bag truss worn after the operation. RADICAL CURE. This is accomplished by evacuating the fluid, and ex- citing such a degree of inflammation in the tunica vagina- lis and testicle as shall lead to an universal adhesion of this' membrane to the tunica albuginea, and consequently occa- sion a complete obliteration of that cavity, in which the water was collected. The object may be achieved by a seton, by caustic, by an incision, or by distending the cavity of the tunica va- ginalis with a proper kind of injection. SETON. Mr. Pott used to give the preference to this method. The tumour is to be pierced, and the fluid discharged by means of a trocar in t,lie common way. A seton-cannula is then to be passed through that of the trocar, until it reaches the upper part of the tunica vaginalis. This done, a Sharp-pointed eye probe, armed with a seton, is to be conveyed through the latter cannula ; the tunica vaginalis and integuments are to be pierced by its point, and the seton to be drawn through the cannula, until a sufficient quantity is brought out at the upper orifice. The two cannulaeare then to be withdrawn. The patient is to be put to bed, and may take twenty or twenty-five drops of the tinct. opii. CAUSTIC. The kali pururn cum calcc viva is usually employed \

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 4a7 t f other surgeon of old times, might even contrive to wound the rectum. Mr. Charles Bell conceives, that the best method of per- forming lithotomy, may be accomplished with a staff grooved on the right side, a scalpel with a straight back, and the common lithotomy forceps. The surgeon is to make his incision under the arch of the pubis, by the side of the anus; he is to make the wound more deeply, towards the face of the prostate gland, cutting near the staff, but not cutting into it, and avoiding the rectum by pressing it down with the finger. Now, carrying the finger along the staff, the prostate gland is felt. The point of the knife is to be passed some- what obliquely into the urethra, and into the lateral groove of the staff, just before the prostate gland. The knife is pushed along the groove of the staff, until the urine flows. The forefinger follows the back of the knife, until this is in the bladder. The finger being passed into the bladder is to remain there, while, at the same time, the knife is withdrawn. Then the forceps is to be introduced, under the direction of the finger. CHAP.

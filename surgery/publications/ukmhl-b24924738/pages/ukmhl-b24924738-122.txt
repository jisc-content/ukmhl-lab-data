In some instance, the ball remains on the side of the limb opposite to its en- trance, beneath the integuments. If the skin, under which £ a 15 lo(JoC(!) be contused in such away that it will probably slough, it is to be considered as a lifeless part, * • an opening is to be made into it for the extraction of the ball. But when the ball lies so (hr from theskin that one can omj, just feel i, and the skin itself remains uninjured, it is improper to make a counter-opening. Experience proves that, the wound heals much better when the ball is left alone, and that the chief inflammation is not in the vi- cinity of the foreign body, but about the month of the wound. In cases where a counter-opening had been made Mr. Hunter noticed that the same inflammation sometimes attacked it, which took place at the entrance of the ball. Such instruments as screws, gimlets, and bullet drawers, ought never to be used in extracting bullets. The fingers are commonly the most proper instruments; and when forceps are judged more convenient, they should not be of a large clumsy construction. AI though one might judiciously omit an incision to ex- tract a smooth, round body, like a leaden bullet, one might not always act w ith erjual judgment by doing so, when the extraneous body is of an angular figure, and large size, so as to be likely to cause immense irritation. i>ef ached splinters of bone are very irritating extraneous bodies. TV hen their extraction can be accomplished, con- sistently with the above principles, it ought never to be neglected. In gunshot wounds ligamentous bands sometimes appear to compress the tumefied parts beneath.

The affection is never continual, but makes its attacks at certain, or uncertain periods, and its duration is sometimes short, sometimes long. The spasmodic ptosis usually depends on some sympa- thetic irritation in the system.

The eyes weep con- stantly, because the interruption of the alternate closure and opening of the eyelids hinders the tears lrom passing into the nose; the patient becomes blind in a very light situation, in consequence of his not being able to diminish the rays of light which tall on the eye ; and, on the same account, the sight becomes gradually very much weaken- ed ; the patient cannot sleep in any situation where there is the least light; and the extraneous substances in the at- mosphere, settling on the eyeball, cannot be washed away by the action of the eyelids, so that they occasion irrita- tion, pain, and redness. The cause of this complaint sometimes depends on a swelling, or protrusion of the eyeball out of the orbit. But the defect commonly lies in the upper eyelid. Some- times, though very seldom, it originates from a paralytic affection of the orbicularis muscle. This case requires the same kind of treatment as the second species of ptosis. Lagophlhalmus most frequently arises from a contrac- tion of the skin of the upper eyelid, in consequence of

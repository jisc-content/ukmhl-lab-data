T.hc supeificial branch of the internal pudendal artery, situated on the dorsum of the penis, and two arteries near the septum of the corpora cavernosa, may be tied. The he- morrhage, from the cells of the corpora cavernosa, may be stopped by applying scraped lint. In order to prevent a closure of the urethra, as well as to enable the patient to make water easily, and keep the urine from coming into contact with the wound, it is necessary, after the operation, to introduce a short silver cannula into this canal. The cannula must be made with little rinÂ«s that it may be conveniently fastened in its situation. CHAP. XLVI. STRICTURES IN THE URETHRA. THE urethra naturally possesses a power of contrac- tion and relaxation. When any part of this canal is af- fected with spasm, it loses the power of relaxing itself, in a due degree, and a spasmodic stricture is the result. As Mr, Home observes, while a stricture is in this stage, it is only a wrong action of the membrane of the urethra; and if the parts could be examined in their relaxed state, there would be no appearance of disease. The second kind of stricture is both permanent and spasmodic ; so far permanent, that the affected part of the canal is always narrower than the rest; and so far spasms die., that this same part is liable to contract occasionally in a still greater degree. When the simple narrowness of the canal becomes a ridge, forming a continual projection, the case is a true

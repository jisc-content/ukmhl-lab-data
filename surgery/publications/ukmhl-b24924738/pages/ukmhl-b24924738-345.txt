305 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. latter instrument introduced as far as the tonsil; a he li- gature on each side is then to be drawn tightly, and fastened round rings at the end of the cannula. The instru- ment may next be twisted till a due degree of constriction is produced. When the base of the tumour is broad, Cheseldenâ€™s plan of introducing adouble ligature through the swelling, and tying One portion over each half of the base, need only be mentioned, as no practical surgeons are now likely to adopt the method. We have already observed, that the removal of the whole enlarged tonsil is unnecessary, and therefore injudicious. We may now notice, that a portion of the tumour may be cut away without any just ground for fearing a dangerous bleeding. The application of a ligature occasionally produces a very perilous degree of swelling of the diseased tonsil. Bertrandi, and many other eminent surgeons, have been in the habit of cutting aw-ay enlarged tonsils, without ever meeting with an instance of danger from the subse- quent bleeding. The operation may be done with a pair of scissars, con- structed with short blades and long handles ; or it may be performed with a bistoury, which, in general, must be the best instrument. The hemorrhage may usually be stopped by washing the mouth repeatedly with very cold water. When the enlargement of the tonsil is really of a scir- rhous nature, an operation, performed so as to remove only a part of the indurated enlargement, would not be followed by success. Calculous concretions have been known to form in the tonsils, and occasion troublesome coughing, sore throats, See. The propriety of extracting them, when their exist- ence is clearly ascertained, is almost too obvious to require being mentioned. x

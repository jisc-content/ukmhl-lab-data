51 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. nour of the invention of the tourniquet, which happened about 1G74. But Morelâ€™s tourniquet was far from per- fection, for it compressed equally every part of the cir- cumference of a limb, not acting more on the situation of the main artery, than on any other point Petit has im- mortalized his name, by devising the construction of the instrument on the principle now adopted in modern prac- tice. The tourniquet, now in use, consists of a band and buckle, a pad, and a sort of brass bridge, capable of being elevated, and depressed, by means of a screw. The band is first buckled round the limb in such a manner, that the pad which is attached to the band, is placed ex- actly over the artery. The bridge, over which the band proceeds, is to be then raised by turning the screw, and thus a due degree of pressure is produced. The advantages of this instrument arc so considerable, .that its first invention constitutes a great epoch in the annals of surgery. The pressure may be regulated with the utmost exactness, and it operates chiefly on the point, where the pad is placed, and where the main artery lies. The instrument does not require the aid of an assistant to keep it tense; it completely commands the flow of blood into a limb ; it may be relaxed, or tightened in a moment; and, when there is reason to fear a sudden renewal of bleeding, it may be left slackly round a limb, and, in case of need, made tense in an instant. Its operation is, however, limited to the limbs, and as the pressure, necessary to impede the flow of blood through the principal artery, completely prevents the return of blood through the veins, its application cannot be made very long without inducing gangrene. Nor does it have ar^ direct effect in promoting the closure of the wound in the artery. Hence, its utility is confined to preventing, and putting a sudden stop to profuse hemorrhages, until the surgeon has had time to put more permanent means into practice'. e 2

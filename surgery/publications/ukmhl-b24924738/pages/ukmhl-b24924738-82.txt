first lines of the 32 The tourniquet is occasionally applied in a moderate stale of tension, with a view of weakening, not suppress- ing, the current of blood into a limb. The common one ^does not accomplish this object advantageously, because, in letauling the return of blood through the veins, it has the effect of rendering the arteries more charged with blood, consequently any that are wounded, more likely to bleed. In cases of aneurisms, where this plan is sometimes practised, the compression of the veins does infinite harm, by augmenting the oedema, and painful tension, so fre- quently attendant on that disease. 2. LIGATURE. We have observed, that the tourniquet is generally em- ployed, only as a temporary means of suppressing he- morrhage. Let us now take a view of other means, which kfve a permanent effect in the stoppage of bleeding, by producing a closure of the wounded vessels. The most important of these is the ligature, by which the most alarmirtg effusions of blood may be rest rained. By this the mouths of the divided arteries are lied, and thus, not only an instantaneous stop is put to further hemorrhage, but, long before the ligature becomes loose, the opposite sides of the vessels have grown together, and all danger of the re- newal of hemorrhage is over. , No other plan of preventing bleeding from large arte- ries is so secure as the ligature, because no other makes such direct pressure on them, or acts with such little chance of being displaced. It'is in the ligature, that modern surgery has a very material superiority over its ancient state. In the performance of operations, large vessels are often wounded in situations, where the tourni- quet cannot be applied. The scientific surgeon now knows that he can tie such a vessel immediately^ is wounded, and then continue his incisions, without that confusion and

FIRST; LINES OF TI1E 446 cases of obstructions in the urethra, when an inflexible sil- ver catheter could not be passed. Sometimes, the instrument is difficult of introduction, owing to a spasmodic affection of the urethra, and neck of the bladder. In this case, a dose of opium should be admin- istered, before a second attempt is made. When inflamma- tion is present, the introduction may often be facilitated by a previous bleeding. The operation of introducing the catheter may be per- formed, when the patient is either standing up, sitting, or lying doAvn. In performing if, one of the most important maxims is never to force forward the instrument, Avlien it is stopped by any obstacle. It there are no strictures, the stoppage of the catheter is always ow ing to one of the folIoAving cir- cumstances. Its beak may be pushed against the os pubis. This chiefly occurs, Avhen the handle of the instrument is prematurely depressed. Here the employ- ment of force can obviously do no good, and may be pro- ductive of serious mischief. The beak of the catheter may take a Avrong direction, and push against the side of the urethra, especially at its membranous part, Avhich it may dilate info a kind of pouch. In this circumstance, if force â– \vere exerted, it Avould certainly lacerate the urethra, and occasion a false passage. The end of the catheter may be entangled in a fold of the lining of the urethra, and here force would be equally Avrong. Lastly, the point of the instrument may be stopped by the prostate gland, in Which event force can be of no service, and may be pro- ductive of great harm. Hence, it is always proper, to Avithdraw the instrument a little, and to push it gently on- ward in a different position. As Richter states, the operation may be divided into three stages : in the first, the catheter passes, in the male subject, that portion of the urethra, which is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum ; in the second, it passes the

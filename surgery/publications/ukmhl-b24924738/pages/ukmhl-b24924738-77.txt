One of the best applications to chilblains of the first and second sort, is ice-cold water. The part affected is to bn immersed in it a few minutes, two or three times a day, until the complaint quite disappears. This event usually happens in less than four days. After every application the part is to be well dried, and covered with leather socks. In some cases tonics and" astringents have had the best effect.

In o,ther instances, oleum terebinthltiae mixed with the balsam copaivte; or a mixture of two parts spir. vini camph. and one part of aq. litharg. acet. have proved the best applications. Suppurated chilblains require topical stimulants, such as warm vinegar ; a mixture of aq. litharg. acet. and aq. calcis ; or a salve containing the hydrarg. nitrut. rub. It is frequently necessary to touch such ulcers witli the argentu m nitratum. Gangrenous chilblains must be treated according to the rules explained in the chapter on mortification. CHAP. XII.

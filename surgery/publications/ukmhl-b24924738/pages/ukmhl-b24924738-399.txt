357 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. had -wounds of their intestines healed, should afterwards be particularly careful not to swallow any hard substances, or indigestible, flatulent victuals. Sometimes the contents of the intestines continue to be discharged through the wound, so that either a fistula, or an artificial anus is formed. There is reason to appre- hend the formation of a fistulous*opening, when an intes- tine has been injured by a ball, when it has been quite cut through, or is in a mortified state. But numerous cases have evinced that this is not invariably the consequence, and that a perfect cure has frequently followed each of these occurrences. When an intestine is completely cut through, or is mor- tified, the upper end being exposed, and the lower inac- cessibly concealed in the cavity of the abdomen, there is a necessity to promote the formation ot an artificial anus. For this purpose the extremity of the intestine is to be at- tached by a fine suture to the edges of the external wound. To distinguish the upper end of the intestine from the lower the surgeon should give the patient something to drink, and observe whether it issues, after a certain time, from the mouth of the gut. Until this point is ascertain- ed the surgeon is unwarranted in practising a suture ; for if the upper end should be situated in the abdomen, no one can doubt the propriety of enlarging the wound to search for it, as it is the only means of affording the pa- tient a rational chance of preservation. Gunshot wounds of the abdomen are scarcely ever at- tended with protrusion of the intestines. The treatment 'in thc^e cases is limited to the employment of general means, which have sometimes the happiest effect. y

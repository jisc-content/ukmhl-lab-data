It seems, also, need- less to explain, exactly, how he should proceed, if the processus dentatus were fractured, and the second vertebra, consequently, luxated sideways. DISLOCATION OF THE VERTEBRAE. The dorsal and lumbar vertebrae arc very rarely dislo- cated, on account of the strength of the ligaments, and the conformation oi the bones themselves. However, occa- sionally, the oblique, or articular processes being fractur- ed, by the operation of great violence, the vertebrae are usually disloca.ted. 'Hie symptoms are, an incapacity to stand erect; the patient leaning sideways, or forwards; the spinous pro- cesses become irregular in their arrangement; and there are signs of the spinal marrow being injured, or compress- ed ; retention, or incontinence of the urine, and faeces; the lower extremities become paralytic and motionless; and even death itself may follow, The symptoms must neces- sarily vary, according to the degree of pressure, which the spinal marrow suffers, and the situation of the luxation. Very similar symptoms may also arise, when the spinal marrow has merely undergone a very violent concussion, without any dislocation of the vertebra?. The ancients have given us descriptions of various ma- chines kg reducing these luxations; but whoever considers the danger there is of increasing the pressure on the spinal marrow, instead of diminishing it, by the application of force, will be cautious not to be too bold. It is very certain, that most of the cases, mentioned hy authors, as dislocations of the vertebra?, have only been concussions of the spinal marrow, or fractures of the above bones. DISLOCATION OF THE OS COCCYGIS. This bone is said to be liable to two hinds of luxations;

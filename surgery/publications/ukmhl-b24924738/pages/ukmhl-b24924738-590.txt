I is * FIRST LINES OF THE elbow and forcafm in a sling ; in pushing downward thesca- pillar end of the clavicle, while an effort is made to raise the acromion ; and in applying compresses, and a spica bandage, for the purpose of keeping the end of the clavicle from ascending again. At the time of attempting to reduce this dislocation, the trapezius muscle ought to be relaxed. Thc^dislocation of the clavicle from tlie sternum is to be reduced; by making pressure in a proper direction. The arm is to be kept quietly in a sling; and, in short, the same treatment is to be adopted, as if the bone were' broken. DISLOCATION OF THE OS URACI111. The shoulder joint, is so loose, and moveable, and (he glenoid cavity of the scapula so shallow, that more dislo- cations are said to occur in this situation, than in all the other join s together. The acromion and (he coracoid pro- cesses of the scapula, and the ligament, between them, pre- vent luxations upward. Th6 arm may be luxated directly downward, ill such a way, that some point of the head of the. bone rests against the inferior edge of the scapula. This case, however, is uncommon.' The head of (he os brachii may, also, be dislocated forwards, towards the breast; or it may be luxated backwards, under the spine of the scapula. The two latter cases arc exceedingly common. The three above mentioned dislocations are usually distinguished by the tends, downward, forward, and bavhtcard. In the dislocation downward, the arm seems longer than is natural, and it is a little raised from the side, while the forearm is extended, in consequence of the ten- sion of the triceps musold. The arm cannot possibly be approximated to the chest, nor can the forearm be bent, without creating pain. A vacancy is distinguishable mi- ller the acromion, and the deltoid muscle, being unsup-

530 .FIRST LINES OF THE FRACTURES OF THE THIGH. The fractured os fcmoris is a*tended with the following symptoms : severe local pain at the instant of the accident; sudden incapacity to move the limb ; a crepitus) which is sometimes very distinct on moving the ends of the fracture ; deformity, which occurs in a triple relation to length, breadth, aud direction. In regard to this latter diagnostic mark, viz. the deformity in cases of fractured thighs, it is necessary to have very precise ideas ; fur, as it has a con- tinual propensity to be reproduced, particularly in oblique fractures, its prevention is the principal object in the treatment. ' By far the majority of fractures of the thigh are attended with deformity ; a few transverse ones, and a few situated near the condyles of the os femoris, are the only excep- tions. If we consider the deformity, in regard to length, we find, that in oblique fractures, the limb is constantly shorter, than that of the opposite side, a circumstance plainly indicative of a displaced state of the ends of the fracture. By examining the situation of the .accident, one may easily ascertain, that the shortening of the limb arises, altogether, from the lower end of the fracture being drawn upward, beyond the upper one, which itself remains mo- tionless. The muscles are the only powers which caK cause this motion of the lower end of the fracture, from be- low upward. Attached on one side to the pelvis, and on the other to the patella, tibia, at 1 fibula, they make the for- mer their fixed, and the latter their moveable points ; and drawing upward the leg, (he knee, and the lower portion of the os femoris, they produce the displaced condition of the fracture. The triceps, semitendinosus, semimembrano- sus., rectus, gracilis, biceps, &c. are the chief agents. In Desaultâ€™s works, from which I have extracted the above accurate remarks, a case is mentioned, which affords a very striking illustration of the power of the muscles,, in

220 FIRST LINES OF THE PHRENITIS. Inflammation of the brain is a frequent consequence of injuries of the head. There is an increased and disordered i stale of the sensibility of the whole nervous system ; the retina cannot bear the usual stimulus of light ; the pupils are contracted ; the pulse is frequent and small; the eyes are red and turgid, perhaps in consequence of the ophthal- mic artery arising from the internal carotid ; the counte- nance is flushed, and the patient is restless, mutters inco- herently, and grows wild and delirious. Phrenitis is treated on the antiphlogistic plan. Copi- ous bleedings and other evacuations are highly proper. Tire blood should be taken from the temporal arteries. The skin ought to be kept moist with antimonials, and a counter-irritation should be excited on the scalp by blisters. OPERATION OP TREPHINING. / This operation consists in removing a portion of the skull, for the sake of elevating a part of the bone producing dangerous pressure on the brain, or in order to give vent to collections of matter, or blood, which have the same effect. Every part of the cranium cannot be trephined with equal safety. The moderns have discovered, however, that the mere presence of a suture ought not to deter the surgeon from making the perforation in any place, which seems advantageous. We ought not to apply the instru- ment, except where it can take out a complete circle of bone, without injuring the dura mater beneath. I: believe trephining may be performed in any practicable situation, without being deterred by the fear of wounding the longi- tudinal sinus,* or spinous artery of the dura mater. The * Before this vessel reaches the os occipitis. The spinous artery might certainly be wounded, where it lies in a groove, at the anterior inferior angle of tire parietal bone ; but a small plug of lint would un- doubtedly stop the hemorrhage.

FIRST LINES OF THE 536 ■which draw upward the superior portion, and from the flexion of the knee, bj which the inferior part is moved downward. Hence, the proper means for maintaining the fracture in a state of apposition, are such as oppose the action of the muscles, and such as keep the leg perma- nently extended. The power of the muscles is to be dimi- nished by putting them in a state of relaxation, and by compressing them with a roller. The leg is to be extended on the thigh ; this is to be bent on the pelvis; a bandage to beappLed to the whole thigh ; and, lastlj^some mecha- nical resistance is to be made above the upper portion of the broken bone. For the last purpose, a compress is usually put under the roller. The limb is most conve- niently kept in the proper position, by placing two splints along the sides ol the knee joint, and making the part of the bed on which the leg and thigh are laid gradually as- cend to a proper height, from the patient’* buttock to his heel. It is remarkable, that the broken patella hardly ever unites by means of callus: the connecting substance, in gt least ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, is found to be of a ligamentous, or cartilaginous nature. FRACTURES OF THE LEG. "W hen both the tibia and fibula are broken, the patienf~ cannot bear the weight of the body on his limb ; but when the fibula alone is fractured, though progression is attended with pain and difficulty, it is not altogether impracticable. In examining a leg, suspected to be fractured, the surgeon should trace the anterior surface of the tibia, called the shin, and the spine of this bone, in order to ascertain, whe- ther any inequality, or projection exists. However, in fractures of the tibia, a crepitus generally makes the nature of the case sufficiently manifest. When the fibula is the only bone broken, the injury is not so easily ascertained, because the tibia, (he main bone of the leg, still preserves

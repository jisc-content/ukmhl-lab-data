PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 407 with hard and rising edges. This eminent surgeon never saw the complaint occur under the age of puberty. In no great length of time, it makes its way completely through the scrotum, and attacks the testicle, which it enlarges, hardens, and renders thoroughly distempered. Next it extends up the spermatic cprd, contaminating the ingui- nal glands, and parts within the abdominal ring, and then very soon becoming painfully destructive. It is supposed that this terrible malady commonly de- rives its origin from the lodgment of soot in the rugÂ® of the scrotum- Hence, at iirst, it must be entirely pi a local nature. THEATMEXT. Mr. Pott remarks, that if (here be any chance of putting a stop to the above mischief, it must be the immediate re- moval of that part of the scrotum where the sore is; for if it be suffered to remain until the testicle becomes affected, the performance even of castration will generally be too late. Mr. Pott states, that lie has many limes made the experiment, and that though the wound made by such " operation sometimes healed favourably, yet, in the space ot a few months, the patients returned either with the same disease in the other testicle, or in the glands of the groin, or with such a diseased state of the viscera, as scum ended in a painful death. I have never seen this disease materially Ix'uetitcd by any medicines, or topical applicTifioiis; and I am, there- fore, str ugly impressed with the propriety of an early re- moval of the affected part of the scrotum. The loss of a portion of this part can never be attended with future in- convenience ; and, as Mr. Pott very justly observes, it is a very good and easy composition for the preservation of life.

FIRST LINES OF THE 228 Wounds of the eyebrows sometimes cause a species of blindness, named the gutta serena. This consequence is commonly thought to be owing to an injury of the nervous filament, which comes out of the orbit, at the notch in the superciliary ridge. It is very probable, however, that the affection of the eye is not altogether dependent on the in- jury of this nerve ; for the blindness very often occurs when the cut is not situated near the track of the nerve, and frequently does not occur when (he nerve is known to be divided. It is when the wound is nearly, or quite heal- ed, that the event is most likely to happen. When a wound, in any part of the face, cannot be pro- perly brought together by means of sticking plaster, the twisted suture, employed for the cure of the hare-lip, is generally made use of. As the parotid duct passes beneath the integuments of the cheek, over the masseter muscle, it is much exposed to wounds, which, it not properly treated, end in what are termed salivary fistulae. This is the subject of the ensuing chapter. CHAP. V. , • SALIVARY FISTULA. r A SALIVARY fistula is an opening on the cheek, from which saliva escapes, when the patient masticates or con- verses. At this time the saliva flows out so copiously, that it wets the patient’s clothes. During a meal, two ounces of saliva have been known to escape, in the short space of a quarter of an hour. The great loss, every day, of a fluid so serviceable in digestion, is apt to occasion a loss of ap- petite, indigestion, weakness, and emaciation; and the

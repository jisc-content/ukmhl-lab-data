433 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. responding to a line drawn from the o$ cocrygis to the umbilicus. By following this plan, the gorget can hardly ever wound the rectum, or insituate itself into the cellular substance, between this intestine and the bladder. The ut- most caution must be observed to maintain the groove of the staff, and beak of the gorget, in contact; When the gorget has been introduced, the staff is to be withdrawn, and a proper pair of forceps is to be passed, along the concave surface of the gorget, into the bladder, for the purpose of seizing, and extracting the stone; While the operator is passing the forceps along the gorget, the latter instrument must be kept quite motionless, lest its sharp edge should do mischief; and, immediately the forceps is in the bladder, the Cutting gorget is to be with- drawn. / It is very questionable, whether it would not be better always to withdraw the gorget, as soon as the incision is completed. Very good surgeons are of opinion, that when the wound is made in the above direction and free man- ner, there never can be any difficulty in passing the for- ceps into the bladder, without any guidance of the gorget. For my own part, I cannot conceive, that a blunt gorget need ever be introduced, after the cutting one has been withdrawn ; for the forceps must obviously pass through the wound, quite as easily as any blunt gorget can possibly do. The next object is to take hold of the stone with the blades of the forceps. In order to accomplish this pur- pose, the operator should not expand the instrument, as soon as it has arrived in the bladder ; but, he should make use of the instrument as a kind of probe, for first ascertain- ing the exact situation of the stone. If this body should be lodged at the lower part of the bladder, just behind the neck of the viscus, and be distinctly felt below the blades of the forceps, the operator is to open the instrument immediately over the stone, and, after depressing the nS

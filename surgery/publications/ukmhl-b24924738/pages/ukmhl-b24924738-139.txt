PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 30» The operation of opium maybe aided by combining this medicine with such others as any particular symptom may indicate. When the perspiration seems suppressed, the warm bath, blisters, camphor, volatile alkali, musk,anti- monial wine, and small doses of antim. tart, may be tried. When there is evident debilily, bark, the cold bath, and the liberal use of wine, are recommended in conjunction with the opium, which must always be considered as the grand medicine. * Some practitioners have tried the effect of salivation, on the supposition that the mercurial action on the constitu- tion might alter that condition of the system with which tetanus is evidently connected. Little, however, can be said in favour of the plan. All the best writers on this subject condemn evacuations ; but clysters and aperient medicines may, now and then, be administered to remove the constipation caused by the « opium. There never can be any difficulty in conveying food and medicines into the stomach, now that surgeons arc so well acquainted with the uses of hollow bougies. I am not unaware that Mr. Abernethy has suggested the propriety of attending to the state of the chylopoietic or- gans in tetanus ; 1 know that Dr. Hamilton endeavours to make it seem probable that the utility of purgative medi- cines might be extended to this disorder; but from the ex- tensive trial of purgative medicines already made in this disease, from the complaint not attacking particularly un- healthy subjects ; and from the regularity of the digestive organs, so particularly noticed by all writers ; I am afraid that these suggestions present but a very faint prospect of practical benefit.

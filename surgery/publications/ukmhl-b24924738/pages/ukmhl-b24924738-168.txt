134 FIRST LINES OF THE tirpate them. Their dispersion cannot be accomplished in the majority of cases, and this does not seem extraordinary Avhen we recollect that the contents are often a thick, un- vascular matter. Besides, even if it were in our power to bring about the absorption of what is contained in the cyst, still the cyst itself would remain, and its extirpation would be required. After promoting the absorption of the contents of en- cysted tumours, or after discharging them by an opening, it has indeed been recommended to obliterate the cavity of the cyst altogether, by making its opposite sides grow together by means of external pressure. But there is al- ways some risk in irritating encysted tumours, and cases arc not wanting in the records of surgery, by which it is proved, that such diseases are in this manner very capable of being converted into fungous and inveterate ulcers, and even carcinoma. The most successful applications for discussing en- cysted tumours arc such as contain sea salt, sal ammo- niac, &c. The best practice, however, is the operation by which the swellings are cut out. The art of doing this with adroitness consists in dissecting the parts, surrounding the tumour, without wounding the cyst. If (lie latter accident, occur, tlie contents frequently flow out, the cyst collapses, and the continuance of the dissection is attended with more difficulty. It is a great point to remove every par- ticle of the cyst, and hence it is satisfactory to take it out entire, that is, without wounding it. 'When any portion remains behind, the wound will frequently not heal, in con- sequence of fungous granulat ions, arising from the diseased part. Unless the swelling be large, a single incision through the skin is sufficient; but in other instances it is advantageous to make two cuts in this manner () ; first, because it facilitates the removal of the tumour; secondly, because it prevents a redundance of skin, which would take

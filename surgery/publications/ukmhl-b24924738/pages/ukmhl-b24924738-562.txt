FIRST LINES OF THE 520 It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the patient must avoid talking, chewing, or moving the jaw in anyway whatsoever. His food should be so soft, as not to require mastication, and it ought, to be put into his mouth with a small tea-spoon. In these cases, I am of opinion, that it would be very proper to convey all nourishment into the stomach through a hollow bougie,, passed down the oeso- phagus. This.would certainly be preferable to the injection of nourishment, in the form of clysters, as advised in the best surgical books. FRACTURE OF THE CLAVICLE. The transverse situation, and the natural slenderness of this bone, render it very liable to be broken, either at its middle, its sternal, or its scapular extremity. Fractures of the clavicle are either transverse, or oblique. The diag- nosisof the latter cases is most conspicuous, and the ends of the bone, thus fractured, must almost necessarily be dis- placed ; for, the scapular portion is drawn downward by the weight of the arm, and the action of the deltoid mus- cle, while it is, also, inclined inward by the action of the - pectoralis minor, and by the arm approaching the breast. The sternal portion of the clavicle, in the mean time, is not at all altered, in regard to its position. As the bone is hardly covered by any muscles, its fractures are very ob- vious to the eye and touch. Gently moving the shoulder and os brachii renders such injuiries still more manifest. No bad symptoms commonly attend fractures of the clavicle, unless emphysema should arise from the lungs being wounded by a spicula of bone, or the subjacent vessels should be injured, or compressed, by the ends of the. broken part. Somet imes, an acute extremity of the frac- ture makes its way through the integuments, and, gene- rally, cannot be reduced, without a dilatation of the wound.

FIRST LINES OF THE 240 sometimes induces a carious affection of the os unguis, and thus the malady becomes more complicated. I utmost in- stances the neighbouring eye is more tender than in the healthy state, and in some it is always more or less in- flamed. Professor Scarpa asserts, that the chief part of the-yellow viscid matter, which accumulates in the lachrymal sac, is secreted by the lining of the eyelids, and by the little glands of Meibomius, and that the altered quality of this secretion has a principal share in the cause of the disease. He states, that the truth of this fact may at once be ascer- tained by everting the eyelids, and especially the lower one of the affected side, and by comparing them with those of the opposite eye. I lie former will constantly exhibit an unnatural redness of the internal membrane, which appears villous along the whole extent of the tarsus, while the edges are swollen, and numerous varicose vessels are dis- tributed on its surface. The follicles of Meibomius are also turgid and prominent. TREATMENT. d he first stage of the fistula lachrymalis, sometimes named the epiphora, and by Scarpa called the purulent palpebral discharge, may frequently be cured by very simple means. I shall not enter into the question, whe- ther the morbid state of the Meibomian glands, and of the internal membrane of (he eyelids, is the cause, or only an effect, of the obstruction in the ductus nasalis; I think the discussion of this point quite superfluous ; for whether it is one, or the other, it is proper to follow the same prac- tice, namely, to make such applications to the inside of the eyelids as have a tendency to improve the quality of the secretion from them, and to endeavour to restore the free passage of the fears into the nose. W hile the lachrymal sac is entire, that is, while the disease is not in an advanced state, the most judicious

184 FIRST LINES OF THE or without opium ; and lastly, a solution of the muriate of mercury (sublimate). One fourth of a grain, dissolved m brandy, or any aromatic water, is the usual dose. With respect to the preparations of mercury, the most simple are not only best, in consequence of their acting whli least violence to the system, but also because they prove most efficacious in the cure of the disease. Hence frictions with the ointment, and the pil. hydrarg. are the most commendable. It is incumbent on me to mention fumigation, another mode of introducing mercury into the constitution through the*skin. Mr. Abernethy has spoken of the advantages of this plan in a publication, and he recommends a powder for the purpose, made by agitating calomel in water, mix- ed with the volatile alkali. The patient is to be placed in a machine, not unlike a sedan chair, but having an open- ing at the top, out of which the patient can put his head. A heated iron is placed in the inside, and when the pow- der is thrown on the hot surface of the iron it becomes vo- latilized, and deposited on the surface of the patient’s body,* This is a most expeditious mode of impregnating the constitution. Mr. Abernethy has thus cured a venereal sore throat in the short space of sixty hours. „ When a patient is too weak to rub in mercury, or to bear its inter- nal exhibition, this plan might be very useful. The established doctrine is, that mercury cures the vene- real disease, not on any chemical principle, but by the particular action, which it excites in the constitution and parts affected. AY ith respect to nodes, mercury is frequently incapable ot removing the whole of ihe swelling. In such cases, * Ihe patient is afterwards to put on his flannel waistcoat and drawers. Very probably it would be quite sufficient to fumigate the inside ol the clothes, and let them be put on carefully afterwards.

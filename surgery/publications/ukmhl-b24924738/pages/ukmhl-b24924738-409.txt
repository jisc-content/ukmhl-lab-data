367 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. vented thereby from going to stool, it is called an incarce- rated, or strangulated hernia. 'I he perilous symptoms at- tendant on this case will be presently detailed, as well as the best means for relieving the patient, and avoiding, if possi- ble, an operation. All that I need observe in this place is, that the bad symptoms are entirely dependent on the con- striction made on the hernial contents, on the oostmetion to the passage of the aliment and fasces through the in- testinal canal, and on the inflamed, and even gangrenous, state of the parts contained in the hernial sac. Other hernias are both strangulated, and incapable of being reduced without an operation. SYMPTOMS OF A STRANGULATED HERNIA. The first symptoms are, a tumour in the situation of the rupture, attended with pain, not only in the part, but all over the belly ; sickness, and inclination to vomit; sup- pression of stools; and some degree of fever.

The skin, especially that of the extremities, becomes cold and moist. As Mr. Pott describes, the eyes have now a languor and a glassiness not easj- to be described; the tumour ot the part disappears, and the skin covering it sometimes changes

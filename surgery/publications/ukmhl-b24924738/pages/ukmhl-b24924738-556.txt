514 FIRST LINES OF THE affection, it is thought, may possibly become continued along the cuticular coat of the vessel to (he heart. If, however, an adhesion of the sides of the vein to each other should be occasioned, a little way from the wound, the expansion of the inflammation will be stopped at the place, where the vessel has been rendered impervious. In one instance, Mr. Hunter employed compression, and he imagined, that he thus limited the extent of the inflamma- tion by producing an adhesion of the above kind. The affccti,on sometimes spreads in the direction from the heart. The treatment should consist in attempting to diminish the inflammation by the usual antiphlogistic means, and, in applying a compress at some distance from the punc- ture, in order to produce an adhesion of the sides of the vein, and thus remove the danger, which would result from the spreading of the inflammation, along the lining of the vessel, towards the heart. INFLAMMATION OF THE FASCIA OF TIIE FOREARM. This is an event, which sometimes follows venesection. The arm cannot be moved, without pain and difficulty. The whole forearm is tender, when compressed, though the integuments are scarcely at all affected. There is ge- nerally a great deal of uneasiness in the axilla, and the af- fection is attended with sympathetic fever. After sup- puration has occurred, the matter does not readily point. The treatment should be antiphlogistic,â€™in every sense of the word. Leeches should be applied ; the pat ient purg- ed ; the arm covered with the saturnine lotion ; and kept quietly in a sling. W hen matter is known to have col- lected, an early depending opening ought to be made, and the arm should be gently compressed with a roller. Mr. Abernathy, in his ingenious essay oa this subject, seems to be of opinion, that the contracted slate of the for .arm, somet imes following inflammation of the fascia.

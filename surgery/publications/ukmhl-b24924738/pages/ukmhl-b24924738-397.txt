PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 355 course of a day or two, at length render it impossible for the bowel to vary its situation. When the wounded part of the intestinal canal is pro- truded, there is no difficulty in applying a suture to it. The object of this suture is, as I have already noticed, to prevent the wound of the bowel from becoming very dis- tant from the external wound, and thereby to diminish the chance of any extravasation among the viscera. The wound of the bowel is to be sewed up, the part reduced, and the ends of the ligatures are to be left hanging out of the external wound, and, by their means, the injured intestine is to be confined closely to the aperture in the pe- ritoneum. When the whole intestine is not nearly cut through, asingle stitch is usually sufficient, and not much inconvenience can be apprehended trom its irritation. A fine round needle, threaded rvith fine siltc, is the most proper to be used. Sometimes oid5r one end of the divided gut protrudes at the wound, and" the other lies in the cavity of the alxlo- mcn. If the other end cannot be found, without enlarging the wound, I question, whether the urgency of the case does not warrant the practice. If the upper end should happen to be concealed in the abdomen, certain death must result from its continuance there. If it be the lower one, and no attempt be made to find it, the patient can only survive with the loathsome affliction of an artificial anus. When the protruded intestine is mortified, the case is exactly similar to a mortified enterocele. With regard to the constitutional treatment, in cases of wounded intestines, it is necessary to say only a few words. The principal indication is to prevent a dangerous de- gree of inflammation,, and therefore the rigorous adoption of the antiphlogistic plan of treatment is indispensable. Let not the surgeon be deterred from employing it, by the apparent debility of the patient, his small contracted a a 2

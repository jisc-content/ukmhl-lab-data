FIRST LINES OF THE Â£00 CHAP. XXXVIII. FRACTURES. FRACTURES are of two principal kinds, viz. simple and compound. By a. simple fracture is implied, a division of one or more bones, without any external w ound, caused by the protru- sion of the ends of the fractured bones. By a compound fracture is meant a breach in the continuity of one or more bones, together with a laceration of the integuments, which laceration is caused by the protrusion of one or both the ends of the fracture. To these divisions of the subject some add a third, call- ing that fracture complicated, which is attended with se- veral breaches of continuity in the injured bone, and with the wound of any large nerve, blood-vessel, &c. Fractures arc also distinguished into longitudinal, transverse, and oblique, according to the direction in which they run. SIMPLE FRACTURES. The symptoms of fractures are exceedingly various ac- cording to thebones which are broken; and though almost all writers have indiscriminately mentioned loss of motion in the injured limb, deformity, swelling, tension, pain, &c. as forming the general diagnosis of fractures, yet it is easily comprehensible by any one acquainted with the' structure of the body, that numerous fractures cannot pre- vent the motion of the part, or occasion outward deformity; and every surgeon must know, that though at first there may be pain in the situation of a fracture, no swelling and tension take place till after a certain period.

The consequence is, that the ex- posure of the eye and sensible lining of the eyeball induces in these parts a species of chronic inflammation, not only attended with a constant flux of tears and pain, but also with a preternatural redness and thicken in a; of the lining: of the everted eyelid. The exposed membrane is at length converted into an indurated, callous substance, which lies just under the globe of the eye. It is obvious, how this dis- ease must obstruct the flow of tears towards the inner angle, and through the panda lachrymalia, and why the complaint should always be attended with a weeping .of the eye. One of the most common causes of this malady is a con- traction of the integuments of the eyelid, or neighbouring part of the face. This change usually follows the cica- trization of burns, ulcers, and wounds. Slight cases, arising in this manner, may sometimes be cured, by keeping the eyelid gradually raised more and more every day, by small strips of sticking plaster, which are to be applied'to the outside of the affected eyelid, and to the lower part of the forehead. It must be confessed, however, that this method seldom proves permanently efficacious. In most instances it is necessary to remove a consider- able portion of the thickened everted lining of the eyelid with the aid of a convex bistoury, and a pair of dissecting forceps. In proportion as the wound heals afterwards, the eyelid, being properly supported by a compress and bandage, returns to its natural position. In the operation, care must be taken not to cut the pimcta lachrymalia. The eyelid is drawn inward again by the same principle, which caused itp eversion, viz. the contraction of a cica- trix.'* There is another species of ectropium, mostly met with

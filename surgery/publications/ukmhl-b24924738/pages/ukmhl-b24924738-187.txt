PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 153 mode of applying- pressure has been already described in the chapter on hemorrhage. Even when a circumscribed false aneurism hhs origi- nated/compression is still applicable as long as the swell- ing is soft, and can be pressed away. A tourniquet is first to be applied to the upper arm, the blood is then to be pressed back into the artery, and pressure applied. But in case there is a great deal of coagulated blood in the aneu- rismal sac, and the tumour is incapable of disappearing on pressure, compression can no longer be of service. The coagulated blood, situated over the aperture oi the vessel, prevents the pressure from operating with sufficient effi- cacy. However, when the quantity of coagulated blood is trivial, a trial of pressure may be made. Sometimes it succeeds; and should it not, still it is productive of some benefit; because while it more or less obstructs the flow of blood through the main artery, it obliges this fluid to pass into the collateral branches, which then become dilated, so that the operation is afterwards more likely to succeed. The varicose, or venous aneurism, is the only one remain- ing to be described. Sometimes in bleeding, the lancet quite transfixes the vein, and enters the subjacent brachial artery. The external wound of the vein heals, but the in- ternal one being prevented from doing so by the How of ar- terial blood into the vein, the latter vessel becomes dilated in the situation over the preternatural communication be- tween the two vessels. Besides the dilatation, there are a tremulous motion, and a pulsation in the vein, attended with a hissing noise, arising from the gushing of the blood into the vessel from the artery. This disease is not dan- gerous ; and we have no instance of its attaining any con- siderable size, or requiring an operation. TREATMENT OF ANEURISM. Internal aneurisms may be considered beyond the reach of surgery ; and all that can be done is, to recommend the

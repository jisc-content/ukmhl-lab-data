This pain frequently con- tinues after the urine is discharged. o V OF THE POWER OF THE MATTER OF GONORRHOEA TO COMMUNICATE THE VENEREAL DISEASE. The arguments in support of this doctrine arc, first, the probability that the Otaheiteans had the venereal disease propagated to them by European sailors who were affected with gonorrhoea ; for these could hardly be supposed to have a chancre, during a voyage of five months,without the penis being destroyed. Secondly, Mr. Hunter mentions a gentle- man who had a gonorrhoea thrice, of which he was cured without mercury. About two months after each infection he had symptoms of lues venerea. The first were ulcers in the throat; the second were blotches on the skin; both which forms of the disease yielded to mercury. Thirdly, two punctures were made on the penis, with a lancet dip- ped in the matter of a gonorrhoea. One of these produced, on the part of the prepuce w here it was made, a red, thick- ened speck, which increased and discharged some matter. This supposed chancre healed on having its surface re- peatedly destroyed by caustic. The other puncture was made on the glans, where it was followed by a pimple, full of yellowish matter. This pimple was touched with caus- tic, and healed in the same way as the sore on the prepuce. Four months afterwards the chancre on the prepuce broke out again; then it healed, and returned. This it did several times ; but always healed w ithout any application to it. While the sores remained on the prepuce and glans, a bubo formed in the groin. A sufficient quantity of mercury was given to cure the gland locally, but not to prevent the constitution from being affected. Two months afier the cure of the bubo, a venereal nicer,'according to Mr. Hunter, formed on one of the tonsils. This was cured b,y mercury ; but the medicine was purposely left oil' as

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. l4.> The terra scirrhus must undoubtedly have some definite meaning, when employed by scientific men. Unreflecting surgeons may use the word vaguely; and, perhaps, in- fluenced by its etymological import, they may call an im- mense number of various morbid indurations scirrhus. I have always considered scirrhus as a diseased hard- ness, in which there is a propensity to cancerous ulcera- tion, and a greater backwardness to recede, than exists in any other kind of diseased hardness, although the skin may occasionally not break during life, and a few scirrhous indurations may have been lessened. Though Richter states that this disposition cannot be discovered till carcinoma has actually taken place; though Messrs. Burns and Home confirm that other indurations and tumours may terminate in cancer; though Mr. Abernethy shews that sarcomatous and encysted turnouts may end in most malignant diseases, and such as merit the name of cancer; yet it is now well ascertained that in all these instances the changes which precede cancerous ulcer- ation bear no similitude to the genuine scirrhus. The puckering of the skin, the dull leaden colour of the integuments, the knotted and uneven feel of the disease, the occasional darting pains in the part, its fixed attachment to the skin above, and muscles beneath, form so striking an assemblage of symptoms, that, when^they are all present, there cannot be the smallest doubt that the tumour is a scirrhus, and that the disease is about to acquire, if it have not already acquired, the power of contaminating the sur- rounding parts, and the lymphatic glands, to which the absorbents of the diseased*part tend. CHARACTERS BT WHICH SCIRRHUS MAT BE DISTIN- GUISHED FROM OTHER DISEASES. A scirrhous induration is not prose to acquire the mag- nitude which almost all other tumours are apt to attain when their growth is not interrupted.

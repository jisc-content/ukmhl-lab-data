525 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. FRACTURES OF THE VERTEBRAE. The spinous, oblique, and transverse processes, and even the bodies of the vertebrae, are sometimes fractured. The spinous processes may be ascertained to be broken by the touch, uidess the swelling of the soft parts should be too considerable. The other fractures of the vertebrae can hardly be detected with certainty. When the broken spinous processes are out of their proper situation, they may generally be replaced with the fingers. Then the surgeon should place, on each side of the fracture, a piece of soap plaster, and over this a pad, and a small longitu- dinal strip of pasteboard. All these are to be retained in their situation by a roller applied round ihe body. Very alarming symptoms generally originate in caseÂ®, in which other parts of the vertebrae are fractured, and they are imputable to the concussion, compression, or other kind of injury of the spinal marrow. The higher frac- tures of the vertebra are, the greater is the danger. A frac- ture of the upper cervical vertebrae, or of the processus den- talus, or a rupture of the ligament of this process, is com- monly productive of instantaneous death. In general, when the patient is not killed in this sudden way, the sur- geon can do little more than employ antiphlogistic means. We read of incisions being made, and of the fragments of bone causing pressure on the spinal marrow, being elevat- ed and extracted ; but what practical surgeon would venture to imitate such practice ? FRACTURES OF THE OS SACRUM, AND OS COCCYGIS. The upper part of the os sacrum can hardly ever be broken, on account of its remarkable thickness; but, if it should be thus injured, the sugeori would have to adopt the same plan, as if a vertebra were fractured. When the lower part of the sacrum, or the os coccygis is broken, and when the detached piece of bone is driven inward, the

192 FIRST LINES OF THE There arc instances in which the head of Ihc bone is dislo- cated, and anchylosis follow's without any occurrence of ab- scesses. Sometimes before matter forms, patients are greatly de- jected by hectic symptoms. In the suppurative stage, the effects on the constitution always become worse. The openings through which the abscesses are dischar- ged, continue in most instances, to emit an unhealthy kind of matter for a long while. The patient either dies of hec- tic symptoms, or escapes with an anchylosis. Morbid anatomy evinces, that the disease, in its advanced state, produces a destruction of the ligaments and cartilages of the joint; the ossa innominata composing the acetabu- lum, are softened in texture, and have large portions defi- cient in consequence of absorption. The head of the os femoris is also frequently affected in tlie same way, and sometimes dislocated on the dorsum of the ilium, large ab- scises occasionally surrounding it. The remote causes of the hip disease are often in disco- verable. A scrophulous habit, external violence, and ly- iruc on the damp ground in summer, undoubtedly frequent- ly contribute to the production of the disease. TREATMENT. From the analogy between the white swelling and hip disease, it is easy to perceive, that the two cases ought to be treated on similar principles. Every thing said on this subject, in the preceding part of the chapter, is lor the most part applicable here. However, though I have thought blisters most effica- cious in checking disease of the knee, caustic issues excel in hip cases. The benefit resulling from both sorts of appli- cations is to be imputed partly to the counter irritation, and partly to the discharge which they occasion. The proper situation for the issue is in the depression just behind and below the trochanter major. It should be

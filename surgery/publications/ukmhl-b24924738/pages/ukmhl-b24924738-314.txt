FIRST LINES OF THE 276 sorbents in the eye. Camphorated emollient poultices may be applied ; the vapours ol the spir. ammonâ–  comp. may be directed against the eye, through a tube two or three times a day ; a blister may be put on the nape of the neck ; and when the irritability of the, organ has di- minished, the vitriolic collyrium may be used. This may afterwards be strengthened by the addition of a few drops of camphorated spirit. Under such treatment the hypo- pium most commonly disappears, in proportion as the chronic ophthalmy is relieved. But success does not invariably follow the most skilful treatment, and sometimes nothing can prevent ulceration, opacity, and bursting of the cornea, and a succeeding pro- lapsus of the iris. 2. DROPSY OP THE EYE. When the secerning extremities of the arteries, and the rhinutc mouths of the absorbent vessels of the eye, do not act in their naturally reciprocal manner, the organ may become distended with a morbid redundance of an aqueous secretion. This malady constitutes what is termed dropsy of the eye, and is attended at first with great weakness, and afterwards with total loss of sight. Scarpa, who has had many opportunities of dissecting dropsical eyes, is inclined to believe, that in the generality of instances the disease chiefly depends on a diseased secre- tion of the vitreous humour, and also occasionally, on a morbid alteration of the alveolary membrane, by which this tumour is produced. The eye affected assumes an oval shape, terminating in a point on the cornea ; then, as the organ enkirges in all dimensions, it projects from the orbit in such a manner that it causes immense deformity, and prevents the closure of the eyelids. The disease is sometimes preceded by blows on the eye, or adjoining temple; sometimes by an obstinate internal ophthalmy. In other instances ii is preceded by no in-

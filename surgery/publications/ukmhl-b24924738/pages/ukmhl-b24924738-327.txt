PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 2Sg usually very much dilated, and the iris moves very slowly and inertly, in consequence of the cataract touching this membrane, and impeding its action. Patients who ha\e milky cataracts, usually distinguish light from darkness very indistinctly, and sometimes not at all; partly because the cataract, when bulky, lies so closely to the iris, that few, or no rays of light can enter between them into the eye ; and partly because the fluid cataract always assumes a glo- bular form, and consequently has no thin edge, through which the rays of light can penetrate. When the opaque lens is of a middling consistence, neither hard, nor fluid, but about as consistent as a thick jelly or curds, the case is termed a soft, or caseous cata- ract. As the lens softens in this manner, it commonly grows thicker and larger, even acquiring a much greater size than that of the fluid cataract. Hence this species of the malady impedes the motion of the pupil even more consi- derably, than the latter sort of case. , The only other species of the disease necessary to be noticed in this work, is the secondary membranous cataract, which is an opacity of the anterior or posterior layer of the crys- talline capsule, taking place after the lens itself has been removed from this little membranous sac by a preceding operation. All cataracts may be complicated with other diseases of the eyes, chronic ophthalmy, lippitudo, gutta serena, ad- hesion of the opaque lens to the iris, &c. CAUSES, &C. Though persons above the age of forty are reckoned more liable to cataracts than younger ones, the disease is by no means unfrequent in the latter: even children are otlen seen affected w ith this kind of blindness, and some are born with it. Persons exposed to strong fires, as black- u

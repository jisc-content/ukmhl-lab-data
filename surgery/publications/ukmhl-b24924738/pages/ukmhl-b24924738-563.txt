PRACTICE OF SURGERY. proper position, with regard to the sternal portion, which is never in the least displaced, an assistant is to draw the patientâ€™s shoulders backward, while another assistant raises the arm, so as both to relax the deltoid muscle, and take off the aveight of the limb. Then the surgeon should place the fracture in as even a position as he is able ; this being done, a piece of soap plaster is to be applied to the part; a figure of eight bandage employed to keep the shoulder backward ; and the elbow and forearm kept well supported in a sling. From the account already given of the manner in which a fracture of the clavicle is displaced, it must be sufficiently evident, that compresses, placed on the situation of the injury, cannot possibly do good, and are very likely to do harm, by pressing tbe scapular end of the fracture downward. Soft pads should be placed under tbe margins of tbe ftxillce, to keep them from being chafed, or otherwise irri- tated by the pressure of the figure of eight bandage. In troublesome cases, it would be proper to keep the arm raised from the side by a suitable pillow, as well as to elevate the shoulder sufficiently to bring the acromion on the side of the injury, as high as the corresponding part of the scapula on the opposite shoulder. In such instances, one would also prefer keeping the shoulder backward, by means of a mechanical apparatus with leather straps. 1 hough I have discouraged the use of compresses, ap- plied above the fracture, it is to be observed, that a skilful surgeon might undoubtedly find them useful in difficult cases, were he to place them judiciously just under the situation of the injury, instead of above it. FRACTURES OF THE SCAPULA. The greatest part of the scapula, being covered with a good deal of flesh, is not very easily fractured. However, this bone is every now and then broken, either at the body, spine, acromion, coracoid process, neck, glenoid cavity,

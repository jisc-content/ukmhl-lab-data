PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 449 as far as the perineum, with its convexity towards the ab- domen ; then keeping the point stationary, they make the handle describe a semicircular movement upward, so as to bring the concavity of the instrument towards the pubis, as it is situated in the above method. Flexible and elastic catheters are introduced, either with, or without a stilet. These have the same curvature as the silver catheter. When there is difficulty in introducing an elastic catheter with a stilet, the latter is to be with- drawn, about an inch, in order to allow the end of the in- strument to become more curved. INFLAMMATORY AND SPASMODIC RETENTION OF URINE. Inflammation, occasioning this complaint, is frequently situated in the neck of the bladder, urethra, or adjacent parts. The difficulty of voiding the urine is rather to be attributed to the spasmodic affection of the urinary pas- Â» sage, than to the swelling produced by the inflammation. The complaint must obviously originate in this way, when the inflammation is not situated in the urethra, and neck of the bladder, but in some neighbouring part, lienee, the antiphlogistic treatment, and antispasmodic remedies, arc both indicated. It is commonly believed, that a mere in- flammation of the neck of the bladder may occasion relen- tionofurinc; but, as Richter remarks, the complaint is, most probably, generally owing to inflammation in the vi- cinity, for inflamed muscles are not prone to contract. In examining the bodies of those subjects, who die of enteri- v tis, we find the intestines preternaturally distended, not contracted. The inflammation, causing retention of urine, may arise from various circumstances. Violent fits of the stone; very bad piles; the use of stimulating diuretic medicines, especially the tinct. cantli. ; the absorption of canfharides from blisters; bruises of the perineum ; fistulas in ano, &c.

438 FIRST LINES OF TIIR Till, ATM ENT, A complete cure cannot be accomplished without re, moving the stricture. But this indication generally can- not be fulfilled in time to prevent all the mischief, arising from the extravasation of urine. An attempt should be made to pass the. bougie ; for sometimes the stricture is, more or less, removed by the ulceration. When this is the case, Mr. Hunter very properly advises the almost constant use of bougies, in order to procure a passage on-? ward into the bladder. While measures are taken for curing the stricture, every thing, calculated to diminish inflammation, is to be put into practice. Bleeding, and exposing the parts to the steam of hot water are particularly proper. Opium, given by the mouth, and in clysters, togethei with.the employ- ment of the warm bath, is the best means of lessening any spasmodic affection. However, all these measures arc too often insufficient, and therefore immediate relief, as Mr. Hunter observes, must be sough?, by endeavouring to um load the bladder, and to prevent the further effusion of urine into the cellular substance. This object is effected by making an opening info the urethra, some where be- yond the sfricture, but the nearer to it the better. Introduce a director, or staff, into the urethra, as far as. the stricture. Cut down on the extremity of the instru- ment, and extend the incision a little further towards the jinus, so as to open the urethra beyond the stricture. When the stricture is opposite the scrotum, Mr. Hunter recommended making an opening into the urethra in the perineum j but here we cannot have the end of the staff'to guide us, ancl we must trust to our anatomical kuowledgc, The rest of (lie .operation resembles that for the cure of a false passage. A flexible gum catheter slipuld then be introduced, and the wound healed. Great attention should still hie paUl to the inflamma- tion, which follows the diffusion of urine. Scarifications l

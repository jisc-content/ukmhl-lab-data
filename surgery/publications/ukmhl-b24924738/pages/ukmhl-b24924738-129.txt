97 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. sion of the part, especially when the fortitude of the pa- tient goes hand in hand with tlie advice.of the surgeon. Oil, when applied, must act either by its insinuating itself between the poison and the wounded surface, or by becoming blended with the virus, and rendering it inert. Powder of canthdrides produces a copious discharge of matter, by which the poison is probably washed out of the wound. The actual and potential cauteries must act in the same way as excision, by killing the part, and allowing the poison to be taken away when the slough separates. Perhaps, indeed, they may decompose the poison ; but they are not deemed of such certain efficacy as the imme- diate removal of the wounded part by the knife. Yet they are certainly preferable to every means, except ex- cision. Great care should be taken in excision to go deeper than the bite. I have heard it proposed to apply an alkaline lotion to the part affected, but I am not acquainted with any facts that would lead one d priori to expect particu- lar benefit from it. Indeed, the opinion of Fontana and Dr. Mead, that the poison is not of an acid nature, does not make it appear likely to do good upon a chemical principle. 2. CONSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT. Emetics have been very much extolled by Dr. Mead, for the relief they afford in bringing the nausea and sick- ness, arising from the bite, to a conclusion. But the testimony of almost all w riters decides in favour of medicines, that possess the faculty of allaying irrita- bility and promoting perspiration. The volatile alkali has obtained the greatest celebrity. Ten drops of the aq. ammon, pur. may be given every hour. Opium, musk, and camphor, are other medicines to which one may ad- yantageously resort. n

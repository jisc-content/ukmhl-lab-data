PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 205 soft materials, it is customary to place a piece of the em- plastrum saponis immediately over the fracture, and to apply, what is termed, aneighteen-tailed bandage, between which latter and the splints, are also interposed pads filled with tow, or any other soft substances. Compresses are generally placed in situations under the splints, where the pressure from such hard instruments is likely to give most pain. When there is much swelling before the ^racture is set, surgeons generally apply cold saturnine lotions instead ot a plaster for the first few days ; and the linen employed for this purpose can be kept sufficiently wet (without taking off the splints), by squeezing the lotion out of a sponge into the interspaces betw'een them. The great parade in making violent extension, in order to reduce fractures, is quite abandoned by the moderns. When the muscles are relaxed in a scientific manner, the ends of the fracture may, in general, be put into a state of apposition with the greatest ease, and very little extension is necessary. Many fractures are not in the least dis- placed. ciiap. xxxix. COMPOUND FRACTURES. A COMPOUND fracture is accompanied with a wound of the integuments, caused by a protrusion of the end of the broken bone. When the wound is large and lacerated, when the bone or bones are splintered into several pieces, and when the neighbouring muscles have suffered a violent degree of contusion, the case must be considered as extremely dan-

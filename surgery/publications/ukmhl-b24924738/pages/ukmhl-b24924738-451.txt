PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 409 proved by the stream of urine being smaller than com- mon, and the circumstance is owing to two causes, viz. the swollen state of the lining of the canal, and its spasmodic contraction. Small swellings are often observable along the lower surface of the penis, in the course of the uretlira. These were suspected by Mr. Hunter to be the enlarged glands of that, canal. Cowperâ€™s glands in the perineum, in some instances, also inflame and suppurate. The natural discharge from the urethra is first changed from a transparent viscid secretion, to a watery, whitish, pellucid fluid; and this, becoming gradually thicker, as- sumes the appearance of pus. The matter often changes its colour and consistence; sometimes it is almost white, sometimes quite yellow, and in other instances greenish. Mr. Hunter was of opinion, that in ordinary cases the morbid affection of the uretlira did not extend very far along this canal from the orifice, perhaps about an inch and a half, or two inches. This is what he named the specific extent of the inflammation. Besides the symptoms already mentioned, there is a very acute, scalding pain experienced in making water, which can often only be discharged by drops, or in an ex- tremely small broken stream. The patient is also obliged to void his urine very frequently. A variety ot other affections is occasionally produced in the neighbouring par's: pain, soreness, and uneasiness, are sometimes experienced all over the pelvis; and the scrotum, testicles, perineum, anus, and hips, become disa- greeably sensible. The testicles often require being sus- pended, and arc so irritable, that the least exertion makes them swell. The inguinal glands often enlarge; and, in this case, the swelling is termed a sympathetic bubo. The bladder occasionally becomes unusually irritable, and can- not bear the least distention, so that the patient is, almost every five minutes, obliged to make water with violent pain

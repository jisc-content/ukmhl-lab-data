418 FIRST LINES OF THE filled, with urine during the act of making water, and great pain is produced. A phymosis is very often productive of bad conse- quences, when it is attended with chancres behind the glans. The latter part being situated between the sores and the orifice of the prepuce, frequently prevents the pus from finding its way outward, consequently there is an ac- cumulation of matter behind the corona glandis ; and this kind of abscess produces ulceration on the inside of the prepuce. When the matter bursts externally, the glans often protrudes through the opening, throwing the whole prepuce to the opposite side. Sometimes paraphymosis is the occasion of worse conse- quences, viz. mortification of the prepuce, including tin* part lorming the stricture. In numerous books, written by very modern surgeons, we find it stated, that the above complaints are almost al- ways owing to a venereal taint. From the preceding ac- count, however, it is sufficiently clear, that any cause, oc- casioning an inflammation and swelling of the prepuce, may give rise either to a phymosis, or paraphymosis; and that of whatever nature the cause may be, the effect itsell is always quite free from all venereal taint. TREATMENT OF PHYMOSIS. No operation should be practised on children for the na- tural phymosis, unless great inconvenience should imme- diately result from the malformation. It is very certain, ihat the constriction frequently goes off, as such subjects approach the adult stale. When a phymosis originates from the irritation of a chancre, a gonorrhoea, or excoriation underneath the pre- puce, the best treatment consists in making the patient re- main quietly in bed, very frequently injecting the satur* nine lotion underneath the prepuce, and applying linen, wet in this remedy, round the penis. 1 hese measures are

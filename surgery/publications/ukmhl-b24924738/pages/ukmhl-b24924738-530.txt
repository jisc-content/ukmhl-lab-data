FIRST LINES OF THE 438 In spina bifida the swelling is soft, and gradually dimi- nislies, or even quite disappears on pressure; but the tu- mour returns immediately the pressure is removed. The fluctuation of a fluid is distinctly perceptible to the touch. The imcguments retain their natural colour and appear- ance. However, the children seem to experience pain, when the tumour is compressed, or when they are placed on their backs. The size of the swelling is very various. I have seen one, situated on the sacrum of a healthy looking child, about a year and a half old, which was larger than its head ;* in general, they seldom exceed the size of aq orange. The generality of children;, affected with spina bifida, are deficient in strength and vigour, and are subject to fre- quent diarrhoea. Some cannot retain their urine and fasces. A weakness and emaciation are particularly observable in the lower extremities, which, indeed, are sometimes almost paralytic. Though most children agree with this account, some are, in every respect, except the tumour, perfectly healthy, and well formed. The swelling cansists of a sac, filled with an aqueous fluid, and composed of the integuments, and of the mem- branous sheath, which lines the canal for the spinal mar- row. The lining of the spinal canal protrudes through a fissure in the vertebrae. This fissure is owing to an imper- fect formation of these bones, and is commonly found at their posterior part, where the spinous processes would otherwise be. The preternatural opening is sometimes con- fined to one bone, and then the swelling often has a small base. In many instances, several vertebras have not their ossification completed behind, so that the canal for the spi- nal marrow resembles an open furrow. The aperture has been known to extend through the body of the affected ver- * This case was shewn to me by Mr. Maul, of Newbury,

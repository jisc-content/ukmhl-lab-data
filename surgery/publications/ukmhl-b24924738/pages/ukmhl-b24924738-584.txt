FIRST LINES OF THE CHAP. LXV. PARTICULAR DISLOCATIONS, DISLOCATION OF THE LOWER JAW. THE lower jaw bone may be said to be subject to only- one kind of dislocation, in which the condyloid processes advance beyond the emirientia articularis, and slip under the zygoma. Sometimes, the luxation is only on one side, but, in general, on both. In the latter case, the appeal- ance of the countenance is much altered ; the mouth is widely open, and cannot be shut; and the length of the face is very much increased by the chin being thrown for- ward, and downward, towards the breast. When only one condyle is dislocated, the mouth is distorted, and turned towards the opposite side, while the fellow teeth of each jaw do not correspond. All dislocations of the jaw are attended with considerable pain ; an inability to arti- culate words ; an incapacity of swallowing; and a flux of saliva from the mouth. The jaw bone cannot be luxated in this manner, unless the mouth, just before the occurrence of Ibe accident, be very much open, in which state, the condyles of the bone are naturally moved forward. Hence, the dislocation mostly happens, when the patient is laughing, gaping, &C. Â£ blow on the jaw, when the mouth is very much open, may easily cause the accident. rlhe case is sometimes produced by the force, used in drawing a tooth. When- ever the lower jaw has once been dislocated, any ol the preceding causes, reproduce the occurrence with much more facility. It is evident from the circumstances, in which a person

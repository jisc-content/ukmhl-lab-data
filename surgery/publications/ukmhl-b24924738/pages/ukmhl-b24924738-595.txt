PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 5£l brought to St. Bartholomew’s hospital, during one of Mr. Long’s accident weeks, about seven years ago. r\ he boy had fallen down, by which accident one of his legs became considerably shortened, with (he toes turned very fir outward. The head of the bone could be plainly felt behind the trochanter major. There was considerable pain, and the patient was quite incapacitated irorn moving the limb. I could not move the extremity in any direction, without a great deal of difficulty and resistance, and without making the lad sutler considerable torture. When proper ex- tension had been made, the head of the bone slipped into the acetabulum, and the boy, almost instantly, became free from pain, and acquired the faculty of moving the thigh bone again in every direction. In about ten days he went from the hospital, able to walk in the most perfect manner. This is the only kind of dislocation of the thigh liable to be mistaken for a fracture of the neck of the bone, be- cause ihc toes are turned outward, and the limb shortened In the common luxation on the obturator foramen, the toes are turned outward ; but the dislocation is easily dis- criminated from a fracture, for the whole extremity seems elongated ; while, on the contrary, fractures are neyer at- tended with any apparent increase of the length ot the limb, but almost always, with a diminution of it, in conse- quence of the lower portion of the broken bone being drawn upward by the action of the muscles. When the on femoris is luxated upward and backward, with the trochanter major forward, and the head of the bone backward, the limb is shortened; the thigh, leg, and foot, arc turned inward ; the patient suffers immense pain, when the on femoris is moved outward, and the fibres of the triceps rendered still more tense, than they must necessarily be by the nature of fhe accident; the buttock appears more pro- minent, on account of the presence of the head of the bone;

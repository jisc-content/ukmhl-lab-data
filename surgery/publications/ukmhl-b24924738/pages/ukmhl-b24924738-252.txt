218 FIRST LINES 01' THE When such symptoms exist, the trephine ought to be applied at that part of the head, where there are traces of external violence. Even when there are no external ap- pearances to determine the place on which the trephine should be applied, it is proper to perform the operation : one perforation might in this circumstance be made in the course of one spinous artery of the dura mater ; if this should not detect the seat of the extravasation, another perforation might be made on the opposite side of the head.* Paralysis is a symptom of pressure on the brain, and when it seems to affect one side of the body more than the other ; when one pupil seems more dilated than the other ; we have great reason to suspect that the extrava- sation is on that side on which there is least paralysis, and least dilatation of the pupil. pressure on the brain from matter. When a considerable collection of matter forms on the surface of the dura mater, it finally produces the same sort of symptoms as have been just described. But, previously to their occurrence, the patient must have betrayed signs of an inflamed dura mater, while, in the situation imme- 4 . . diately over the collection of matter beneath the cranium, the symptoms of pressure from tins cause must have been preceded by a puffy, circumscribed, indolent tumour of the scalp, and a spontaneous separation of the pericranium from the skull under such tumour. If a wound be situated immediately over the part of the cranium, covering the suppuration of the dura mater, the edges lose their vermi- lion hue, and become pale and flabby ; instead of healthy pusathin gleet is discharged, and the pericranium is loosen- ed from the skull, for some extent from the edges of the sore. * Mr. Abernethy has observed, that when blood lies on the dura mater, the bone above it does not bleed when scraped. This is a most valuable remark, if the criterion be found to agree with general expe- rience.

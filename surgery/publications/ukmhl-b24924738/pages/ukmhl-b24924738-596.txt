FIRST LINES OF THE '552 and the whole limb is often quite numbed, by the pres- * sure on the sciatic nerve. * ■ In reducing dislocations of the thigh, the surgeon should place the patient on the side, opposite that on which the 'accident has happened ; and fix the pelvis by placing a sheet underneath the perineum, and tying it to one of the posts of the bed. The multiplied pulley, if this be employed, or another sheet, is to be fastened round the lower portion of the os femoris, just above the condyles. If the head of the bone be on the dorsum of the ilium, or near the sacro-ischiatic foramen, the extension is to be made in a gradual, and un» remitting manner, and in such a direction as seems to be the midline between a right and perpendicular one, in re- gard to the pelvis. As soon as the head of the bone has been brought on a level with the acetabulum, the surgeon is to press it towards this cavity, at the same time that the assistants continue the extension. When the thigh bone is dislocated forward, and down, ward, the object is to make a lever of the bone itself, by placing a sheet a little way below the trochanters, which sheet being properly drawn upward by an assistant, after a little extension has been made, serves as a fulcrum, on which the head of the bone may be moved into the aceta. bulum. In order to accomplish this purpose, sufficient extension is to be made in the same manner as in the fore- going cases, just to dislodge the bone from the place which it occupies; then, while an assistant draws up- ward the sheet, placed a little below the trochanters, the surgeon is tq make a lever of the bone by depressing the Condyles. DISLOCATIONS OF THE PATELLA.. The patella is sometimes dislocated inward, but, very' jarely, outward. The articular surface of the lower end f

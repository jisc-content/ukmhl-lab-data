FIRST LINES OF THE 494 come completely dry, when they are fit for immediate tise. There should always be a greater length of thread, than of peas, by which means, two little portions, at the eftd of the peas, may extend beyond each extremity of the issue, and be first attached there by a very small piece of adhesive plaster. This little contrivance will have great effect, in keeping the whole row of peas in their situation. When the issue is more than half an inch in breadth, two row3 of peas should be placed in it. The issues are to be kept open until the cure is complete, that is, until the patient perfectly recovers the use of his legs, or even for some time afterwards. Mr. Pott very properly notices, that it is prudent to heal only one of them first. In conjunction with the issue, bark, sea-air, and sea- bathing, are frequently proper. I am sorry, I cannot add, that mechanically supporting the spine seems to present any rational prospect of doing good. When the morbid affection of the corpora verte* brarum has advanced to a certain state, the adjoining sound bones, both above and below the seat of disease, become approximated to each other, and, at length, anchylosed. This salutary process, if influenced at all by mechanically supporting the spine, must obviously be retarded. From this account, we also see the reason, why the projection of the spinous processes, at least, in adult subjects, must al- ways remain. In children, however, a great diminution, and, I might add, an entire removal, of a certain degree of deformity, may take place, during the growth of the body. Every surgeon should peruse the excellent account of the present disease, published by Mr. Pott, to whom I am indebted for most of the above short description.

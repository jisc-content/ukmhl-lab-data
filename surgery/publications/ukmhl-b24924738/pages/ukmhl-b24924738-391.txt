34<j PRACTICE OF SURGERY. The ordinary constitutional ones are, spasm, weak- ness, fever, vomiting, anxiety, oppressed respiration, &c. The local consist of pain and tumefaction. When these symptoms appear soon after the wound, and after a time gradually diminish, or go off entirely, but sooner or later originate again, there is reason to consider their first occurrence as the immediate effect of the injury; their second, as the effect of an extravasation. Yet this plan of decision may, sometimes, lead to error. When urine and bile are extravasated, the symptoms of extravasation arise very early, and often continue from their commencement extremely urgent, and without any intermission of mildness. In such cures the local pain, swelling, and fluctuation, often afford ample information, and the latter symptom is particularly decisive when it precedes the pain. Sometimes the escape of some of the extravasated fluid, out of the external wound, conveys instruction to the prac- titioner. It has already been noticed, that all the parts contained in the abdomen are closely in contact with each other, and with the inner surface of the peritoneum. Hence the ex- travasation in question is seldom extensively diffused, as one might suppose, among the exterior surfaces of the different viscera, they commonly lie in one mass. The pressure of the elastic bowels, of the diaphragm, and ab- dominal muscles, not only frequently presents an obstacle to the expansion of extravasated matter, but it oftentimes propels it towards the external wound. We can conceive no power capable of overcoming the resistance so produced to the wide diffusion of extravasated fluids in the cavity of the abdomen. Numerous cases are on record, of persons being stabbed through the body without any evil conse- quences. The bowels have been supposed, in these in- stances, to have eluded the point of the weapon. Indeed, it is rational to credit that this has many times been- the

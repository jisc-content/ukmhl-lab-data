PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 6Â£ the two heads. The slit must he sufficiently large to allow one head of the roller to pass through it with facility. The surgeon is to take one head of the roller in each hand, and apply the bandage first to that part of the limb which is opposite the wound. One head of .the roller is then to be brought round, so as to bring the slit precisely over the breach of continuity. The other head is then to be brought round in the opposite direction, and passed through the slit. The bandage is next to be drawn mode- rately tight, and its two heads being carried round the limb again, the same artifice is to be repeated. A suffi- cient number of turns of the roller must be made to cover the whole length of the wound. When the wound is deep, jt is recommended to place small longitudinal compresses beneath the roller, at a little distance from the edge ofthe wound. As the uniting bandage can only be made use of for Ion* giludinal wounds, which never have a considerable tend- ency to gape, it is quite wrong ever to apply it exceed- ingly tight. The advantages of this bandage are, its having mors power than adhesive plaster alone, to maintain the oppo- site sides of deep wounds in contact; and its acting wit hout the irritation, frequently arising from the application of -resinous substances to the skin. It is not, however, exempt from inconveniences. Its total concealment of the wound ; its lying in irregular folds, so as to create an uneven cicatrix, &c. might be mentioned. 3. ADHESIVE PLASTER. This has been absurdly termed the dry suture, to distin- guish it from sutures, which are attended with bleeding ; and it is erroneously set down in numerous surgical books, as being only applicable to superficial wounds of the skin. It is true, that adhesive plaster has no direct effect of bring*

. FIRST LINES OF TI1E whole ox the cellular substance of the spermatic cord; in others, the fluid is confined to one or more cavities within the sheath of the spermatic vessels. The first case is term- ed simply hydrocele of the spermatic cord; the second, encysted hydrocele of this part. The first complaint is not a very common one, does not cause much inconvenience, unless when very large, is usually mistaken for a varix of the spermatic cord, or an adherent omental hernia, and seldom leads the patient to do any thing else, than wear a suspensory bandage. W hen the disease is of a moderate size, the scrotum ap- pears quite healthy, except that when not corrugated, it seems rather fuller, and hangs rather lower on that side than on the other. The testicle can be distinctly felt, below this fulness, quite unenlarged. The spermatic cord feels consi- derably enlarged, as it its vessels were varicose, or (here existed an irreducible epiplocele. The tumour is broader at the bottom, than at the top. It seems to diminish when compressed, but immediately resumes its former size, when this pressure is discontinued, and as easily in a supine as in an erect posture. There is a very trivial uneasiness, not in the swelling itself, but in the loins. W hen very large, the complaint creates considerable de- lormity and inconvenience. The only mode of radically curing (he disease is making an incision into the tumour from the abdominal ring down to the testicle. Unless the disease were very large and troublesome, the patient should be content with a suspensory bandage. ENCYSTED HYDROCELE OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. This most frequently occupies the middle part of the cord, between the testicle and groin, and is generally of an oblong shape. It is so tense, that the fluctuation of the water within it cannot always be easily distinguished. It is perfectly circumscribed, and occasions no pain. The

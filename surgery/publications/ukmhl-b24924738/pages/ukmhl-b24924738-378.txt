FIRST LINES OF THE 336 CHAP. XXX. REMOVAL OF A DISEASED BREAST, AND fti* taOURS IN GENERAL. THE manner of removing encysted tumours has al- ready been described. AV hen the breast is affected with any disease of an incu- rable nature, the surgeon can sometimes extirpate the ma- lady by cutting away the whole of the diseased parts. If the disease be of a scirrhous or malignant nature, some particularity in the mqdc of operating is requisite. The surgeon ought, in this case, not to be content with merely removing parts, Avhich are palpably and visibly diseased, but he should also endeavour to remove a cer- tain quantity of the substance, which is in the immediate circumference of the disease. In the observations on scirrhus, in the first part of this work, we have mentioned the propensity of the skin to be affected, and the frequent extension of white morbid bands into the surrounding adi- jtose substance. These facts greatly confirm the propriety of making a free removal of the skin, whenever it is in the least discoloured, puckered, adherent to the swelling be- neath, or in any way altered ; and of taking away a good deal of the fat, in which scirrhous tumours are sometimes involved.

When cancer recurs, the skin is the first part in which it usually makes its appearance, and the skin of the nipple in particular.

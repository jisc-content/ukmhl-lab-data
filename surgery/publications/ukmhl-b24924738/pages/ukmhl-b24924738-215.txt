PRACTICE OF SURGERY. â€¢ 131 sciss, which bursts by a small opening: but this com- plaint never looks like an ulcer, which begins on the sur- face, like the true venereal one. This kind of case is al- ways attended with too much inflammation, pain, and swelling, to be venereal, and immediately the little ab- scess has burst, the swelling subsides ; the complaint is also, in general, attended with febrile symptoms. Another disease is an indolent enlargement of the ton- sils, and it is peculiar to persons disposed to scrophula. There are portions of thick mucus, or perhaps coagulating lymph, on the surface of the tonsils, and these are fre- quently mistaken for sloughs, or ulcers. When there is doubt, such matter may be taken away with a probe to shew that there is no cavity beneath. An ulcerous excoriation of the tonsils is another disease, liable to be mistaken for a venereal ulcer of these parts. This sometimes becomes very broad and foul, having a regular margin, but never extending deeply into the sub- stance of the parts, as the venereal ulcer does. The true venereal ulcer is a fair loss of substance, part being as it were dug out from the body of the tonsil. It has a defined edge, and is commonly very foul, having thick white matter adhering to it, like a slough, which cannot be washed away. When the tongue is affected, sometimes if becomes thick- ened and hardened. At other times it ulcerates. NODES. The swellings of the periosteum, tendons, and bones, from a venereal cause, are so called. The progress of the disease iu this form is extremely slow, and attended with little pain. In some cases, however, the pain is consider- able, particularly in the night time. Nodes continue a long time before matter forms, and then it is a very imper- fect kind of suppuration which follows.

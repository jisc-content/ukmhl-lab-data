425 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. In some persons strictures in the urethra occasion a swell- ing of the testicle. A stricture, when permanent and considerable, is very apt to cause, under particular circumstances, strangury; and retention of urine. If a patient go suddenly from a warm into a cald situation, if he drink too frceiy ot wine, eat hiffh-seasoned dishes, catch cold, commit any species ofjntemperance, or delay making water too long after feel- ing the inclination, he exposes himself to the danger of these latter grievances. TREATMENT OF STRICTURES. The first object is to ascertain the precise situation of the stricture nearest the orifice of the urethra. For this purpose a, common bougie, proportioned to the size of the aperture of this canal, is to be gently introduced. If the bougie easily enters the passage, the surgeon may lie well assured that the size of the instrument is not too large, and that no impediment to its further introduction can proceed from this circumstance-? for the mouth of the urethra is naturally its most narrow part. Small bougies, and such as are too much pointed, are very apt to be stopped bv the lacunae, or orifices of the mucous glands, and to lead inex- perienced surgeons into error. In introducing any instrument properly into the ure- thra some degree of skill is displayed. The surgeon should take hold of the penis, by placing the fore-finger and thumb of his left hand on each side of the prepuce, oppo- site the corona glandis ; thus he avoids making any pres- sure on the passage, into which he is about to pass an in- strument. This being oiled, is to be introduced a little way first; then the surgeon is to draw the penis forward, as it were, over the bougie with the index and thumb of his left hand, while, at the same time, he gently find steadi- ly persists in pushing the instrument further info the passage with his right hand. A bougie is to be held like a

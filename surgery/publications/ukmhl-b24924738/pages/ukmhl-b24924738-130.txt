/ . * 9* FIRST lines of the ' BITE OF A MAD DOG.—HYDROPHOBIA/ Of all the poisoned wounds (hat happen in this country, the bite of a mad animal is the most dangerous. The hy- drophobia has been known to originate from the bite of several mad animals besides dogs, especially (hat of cats, ■wolves, and cows. It even arises occasionally from the bite of an angry animal which is not actually mad. JTheie are some wed attested instances of its having come on spontaneously, and one of these is given in the first volume of the Medical Lssays, where hydrophobia oc- curred during an inflammation of the stomach. W hat so frequently occasions the peculiar madness in dogs has not yet been ascertained. The hydrophobic poison resides in the saliva of the mad animal, and there- fore, when a person is bitten through a boot, or other clothing, the danger is much diminished by the chance, that the poison may have been wiped from the teeth before they penetrated the skin. All the symptoms, which ensue in consequence of the bite of a mad animal, are^ very slow in making their ap- pearance. Hence we may infer, there is a considerable ck probability of preventing them in aM cases. However, we can only expect to prevent, for when hydrophobia has come on, the instances of a cure are so few, that we can place no vast degree of confidence in any medicine hither- to tried. That something does prevent the disease in many cases is very certain ; for only a few are seized w ith hy- drophobia out of great numbers that are bitten by almost every mad dog. Dr. Kush, and some other respectable practitioners, are ot opinion, that hydrophobia bears a very strong resem- blance to tetanus. SYMPTOMS OF HYDROPHOBIA.

FIRST LINES OF THE \2& c'cllent plan of treating many ulcers', recommended by Mr. Baynton, was first introduced into practice, I saw much mischief result from the method being very often indiscri- minately applied by dressers to the kind of ulcer under consideration. y borne appearances at once shew the ulcer to be of an ir- ritable kind. When the margin of the surrounding skin is jagged, and terminates in a sharp, undermined edge; when the bottom of the ulcer is made up of concavities of different sizes ; when there is no distinct appearance of granulations, but only of a whitish spongy substance, co- vered with a thin ichorous discharge; when touching the surface causes pain, and very often hemorrhage ; the sore maybe set down as an irritable one. Irritable sores are particularly often situated over the lower end of the fibula, the anterior surface of the tibia, and ligament of the patella. The applications to irritable ulcers should be of the se- dative kind. The steam of warm water acts very benefi- cially on these cases. A warm decoction of poppy-heads, applied every morning and evening, as a fomentation, by moans of flannels, is highly useful. The extract of hem- lock, or opium, dissolved in hot water, makes a very use- ful fomenting liquor, w hen the irritability is great. Emollient poultices may be employed as the continued application,, and that made of linseed is the best. ■ It is frequently particularly serviceable to lay immediately over the surface of the sore, under the poultice, lint dipped in a solution of opium (3ifs. to Ifej. of water). When the weight of the poultice seems to have a bad effect, the lint wet with the above lotion, may be covered with a pledget of simple ointment. The carrot poultice, particularly when made by boil- ing the vegetable, and beating it into a pulp, deserves to be noticed, as a remedy which agrees with as many irrita- ■ hie sores as any tiling known. /

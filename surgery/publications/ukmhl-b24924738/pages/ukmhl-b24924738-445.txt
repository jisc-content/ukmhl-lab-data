The enlargement of the'spcrmatic veins is more fre- quently mistaken for an omental hernia than any otner dis- ease. A friend of mine, who was in the army in Bengal, put himself to the expence of returning to England, incon- sequence of his having been told by the surgeons in India that he had a rupture, while, in fact, his complaint was merely a varix of the spermatic veins; Circocele, as Mr. Astley Cooper remarks, in his book on the inguinal hernia * resembles, in several respects, the lat- ter disease. When large it dilates upon coughing ; and it appears in an erect, and retires in a recumbent, posture of the body. The above surgeon observes, that there is only one sure method of distinguishing the two complaints: place the patient in a horizontal posture, and empty the swelling by pressure upon the scrotum. Then put the fingers firmly upon the upper part of the abdominal ring, and desire the patient to rise : if it is a hernia the tumour cannot reappear as long as the pressure is continued at the ring; but if a circocele, the swelling returns with increas- ed size, on account of the return of blood into the abdo- men being prevented by the pressure. Circocele is attended w ith a sense of weight in the scro- tum ; an unequal knotty swelling; and, if the disease af- fects the whole corpus pampiniforme, with a feel that seems to arise from a bundle of ropes or cords. Excepting the uneasy sensation of weight in the scrotum, the recent cir- cocele is productive of very trivial, or even no inconve- nience. Butin an advanced state of the disease very se- vere pains gradually come on, sometimes extending up- ward to the back and loins, and downward to the thigh. treatment of circocele.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 2<35 certain mark of its disposition to heal. We must now abandon the use of the caustic, and be content with em- ploying the vitriolic collj/rium. Towards the end of the case, if relaxation of the cornea should continue, Janinâ€™s ointment may be serviceable. Slight excoriations of the cornea, being mere separations of the layer of the conjunctiva, naturally spread over that membrane, do not require the use of caustic: for them the vitriolic collj/rium is quite sufficient. Sometimes, as Scarpa accurately describes, the ulcer of the cornea, already very extensive, and being wrongly treated, assumes the form of a fungous excrescence, which seems to derive its support from a plexus of blood vessels in the conjunctiva. This sort of ulcer, left to itself, or treated with slight astringents, produces, in general, a loss of sight. The1 most vigorous measures are indicated. These consist in cutting away the fungus with a pair of small scissars, to a level with the cornea, and continuing the in- cision far enough on the conjunctiva to remove, with the excrescence, the net work of vessels, fromwhich it was sup- plied with blood. Having accomplished this, and al- lowed the blood to flow ireely, the argentum nitratum is to be applied to all that surface of the cornea, which ap- pears to have been the seat of the J'ungus. The applica- tion of the caustic must be repeated, until the ulcerative process changes into the healing one.

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 33V The operation is usually performed as the patient is in a sitting posture, well supported by pillows and assistants. The pectoral muscle is to be made tense by keeping the arm back, by means of a stick, placed transversely behind the back, in front of the forea rms. If none of the integuments are to be removed, a straight incision is to be made through then! ; the tumour is to be regularly dissected all round from the circumjacent parts; and, lastly, its base is to be detached from its connexions, from above downward, till the whole is separated. This is the mode of removing all simple tumours, which are not of a malignant nature, and which are not of an immense size. When the tumour is of a malignant nature, and adherent to the skin and pectoral muScle beneath, the operator is to remove, at least, an inch or two of the fat on every side of the disease. The portion of the skin intended to be taken away must be included in two semicircular incisions, which meet thus Q at their extremities ; and w^en the base of the tumour Is to be detached, the surface of the pectoral mus- cle, wherever it is adherent to the tumour, is also to be re- moved . It is sufficiently obvious, that the advantage of making the incision in the above manner, consists in enabling the surgeon to bring the edges of the wound together after the operation,-so as to form a straight line, and unite by the first intention. The mere magnitude of a tumour frequently renders it highly judicious to take away a portion of the skin in the above method. If some were not removed, the dissection of the tumour would be exceedingly tedious; and, after the operation, the loose undistended skin would lie in folds, and form, as it were, a large pouch for the lodgment of matter. The tumour being removed, the surgeon should examine z

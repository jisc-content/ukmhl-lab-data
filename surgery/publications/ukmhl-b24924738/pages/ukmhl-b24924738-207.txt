Though we are so well acquainted w ith the operation of the venereal poison on the human body, we remain in per- fect ignorance in respect to its general properties. Our want of information on this subject is, however, the less to be lamented ; for were we as well acquainted with the na- ture.of the venereal virus as we are with that of the acids and alkalies ; were it iu our power, in consequence of this knowledge, to introduce such remedies into the system as would completely neutralize the syphilitic poison out of the body; still our projects would fail, since it is the establish- ed doctrine of the disease, that the mere contact of the vi- rus is sufficient for the future production of the malady.; that the poison, when once introduced into the circulation,

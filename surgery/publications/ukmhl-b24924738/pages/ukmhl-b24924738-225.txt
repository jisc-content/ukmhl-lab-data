PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 191 Though there may he more pain ahout the knee than the hip at some periods of the malady, the former joint may al- ways be bent and extended without any increase of uneasi- ness ; but the thigh bone cannot be moved without making the patient experience an increase of suffeiing. Patients soon get into the habit of keeping the thigh somewhat bent, and it can seldom afterwards be complete- ly straightened. Such is the first stage of the disease in its ordinary forms when the health is commonly little impaired. The second stage of the disease is that which is attended with suppura- tion. The symptoms, which are the forerunners of the forma- tion of pus, are different in different cases. This variety depends on the presence of acute, or only chronic inflam- mation. When the former occurs, the parts surrounding the joint, become tense and painful; the skin is even red- dish, and sympathetic inflammatory fever occurs. As the local pain abates rigors take place ; and a swelling, which very soon points, forms in the vicinity of the joint. When the abscess is the consequence of that languid kind of inflammation, which usually occasions scrophulous col- lections of matter, there is not so remarkable an increase of pain in the articulation previously to the occurrence ofsup- puration. Startings and catchings during sleep, are said to be among the most certain siffns of the formation of mat- ter. When the pus forms in this chronic manner, it does not make its wray to the surface so quickly as in cases of ac- tive inflammation. A large fluctuating tumour forms, but it does no* immediately point. At last the limb becomes shortened, and this circumstance when the retraction is considerable, arises from nothing less than an actual dislocation of the h<#d of t he thigh bone, in consequence of the destruction of the cartilages, ligaments, and articular cavity. The shortening of the limb some- times happens before suppuration, for the most part after it.

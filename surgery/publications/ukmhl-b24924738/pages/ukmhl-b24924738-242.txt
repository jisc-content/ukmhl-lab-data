20S FIRST LINES OF THE profited by, in cases of compound fractures, when the sur- geon has it in his power to decide, -whether it is most ad- visable to try to preserve the limb, or to sacrifice it for the sake of the patient’s life. The one is immediately after the occurrence of the acci- dent, and before an inflammatory and gangrenous tendency in the limb has had time to form. Ihe otliei is atter the subsiding of the first inflamma- tory symptoms consequent to the injury, when the consti- tution seems incapable of bearing any longer the great ir- ritation and immense discharge from the wound, and when hectic fever seems more likely to close the patient’s exist- ence, if a further perseverance in an attempt to save the limb be made, than that the object in view should be ac- complished. The treatment of a compound fracture is similar to that of a simple one, only a more rigorous attention to quietude and diet is necessary on the part of the patient, and a more vigilant care on the part of the surgeon. The limb must, as in the simple fracture, be placed in a relaxed position ; the tracturc, if displaced, must be reduced as speedily as possible; the limb must be laid upon a splint, long enough to keep steady the two nearest joints, and having upon it a soft pad, filled with tow, and an eighteen-tailed bandage. The wound must then be approximated, to give it an op- portunity of reuniting by the first intention, which, when it happens, is a most desirable circumstance, as the fracture is immediately converted into a simple one. When the wound suppurates it must have such dressings as circum- stances require, taking care that at each application of .them the fractare is disturbed as little as possible. Though one might, in cases of compound fracture, ge- nerally be induced to have recourse to phlebotomy to com- bat the local inflammation, it is found by experience, at least in London, to be ultimately prejudicial; it weakens

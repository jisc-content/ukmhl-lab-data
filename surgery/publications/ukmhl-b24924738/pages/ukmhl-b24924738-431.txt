339 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. CHAP. XXXV. HYDROCELE. OF this disease there are three principal kinds ; one, in which the fluid is lodged in the cellular texture of the scro- tum ; another, in which it is contained in the tunica va- ginalis ; and a third, in which the fluid collects in the spermatic cord. The first sort is strictly only an anasarcous swelling of the scrotum, and a symptom of a dropsical affection of the whole system.' The two other kinds are absolutely local, generally attack one side only, and are frequently found in persons, who are perfectly free from all other complaints. The case, in which the water is contained in the cellular texture of the scrotum, if a symptom of dropsy belongs to the province of the physician, and if ever a local affection, it requires nothing more to be said concerning it, than what is contained in the chapter on (Edema. HYDROCELE OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. SYMPTOMS. The symptoms of this complaint are a colourless, smooth, roundish, pyriform, sometimes oblong swelling, which slowly and gradually extends upward from the lower part of thescrotum. ' The tumour does not disappear on pres- sure. At first it is soft and fluctuating ; and on the fingers being removed, it immediately rises to its former level. The swelling cannot' be diminished, nor pushed into the cavity of the abdomen, by any artifice of the surgeon. When the disease is more advanced, a,nd has attained a larger size, the tumour becomes oblong, heavy, and hard, though much less so than in the case of an enlarged testi- cle. At the same time the fluctuation grows less distinct.

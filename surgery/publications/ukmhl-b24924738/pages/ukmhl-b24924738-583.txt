PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 539 should be tight enough, to make the splints prevent any motion of the ends of the fracture. The pressure of these hard instruments is pf'eu exceedingly painful, and even productive of sloughing, and ulceration, unless the sur- geon skilfully place soft materials, between them and such parts, as seein most liable to be injured in this manner ; for instance, the lower end of the fibula; the outside and in- side of the foot; the inside of (lie knee, &c. Besides the two splints and pads already mentioned, I find, when the fracture is oblique, and the heel has a great tendency to be drawn backward, that this effect is very much counteracted by applying a compress, and longitu- dinal piece of pasteboard, from the lower part of the belly of the gastrocnemius muscle to the heel, under the straps of the other splines. I have observed, that this method prevents deformity in a very powerful manner. When there is a great deal of contusion of !he soft parts, together with the injury of the bones, it is better, at first, to keep the leg wet with the lotion of sal ammoniac and vinegar, by means of linen dipped In this application, and put under the splints. The splints need not be taken off, every time it is necessary to wet (he linen again : it is quite sufficient to squeeze the fluid out of a sponge, info the in- terspaces between the above instruments. Nothingisso prejudicial, in cases of fractured bones, as too frequently proving the injured parts.

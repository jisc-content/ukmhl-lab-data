45S FIRST LIftES OF THE medicine should be ineffectual, the practitioner may try the effect of exhibiting a grkin of opium, or two grains of ipecacuanha, every night, a little before bed-time. I have not thought it necessary to describe any particu- lar apparatus for catching the urine, in cases in which no cure can be accomplished. There is a particular incontinence of urine, arising from the formation of a preternatural communication between the bladder and vagina. It is usually the consequence of a slough, and sometimes follows difficult labours. The continual dribbling of the urine, through the opening, ge- nerally prevents it from healing ; but by making the pa- tient lie a good deal on her belly, the water is hindered from constantly escaping, and then the aperture sometimes heals. ' Attempts have been made to close the preternatural opening, by scarifying its edges, and keeping them after- wards in reciprocal contact, for a certain time, by means of a twisted suture. If such an operation were found to be practicable, it would be proper to make the patient lie on her abdomen, as much as possible, during the space of two or three days, that is, till the suture were removed. ' CHAP. LI. IMPERFORATED VAGINA. THE vagina, in these cases, is commonly found shut up by a membrane, which is, in fact, the hymen without any aperture in its centre. In new born infants, this mem- brane, sometimes, extends so far forward, that it covers the orifice of the meatus urinarius, and prevents the evacua- tion of the urine.

21 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. OPENING ABSCESSES BY CAUSTIC* The calx viva cum lcuU puro or the Jcali purum alone, is the best caustic for opening abscesses. The part is first to be covered with a piece of adhesive plaster, which has a portion cut out of the figure and size of the opening in* tended to be made in the abscess. The best way of â– making the eschar is to dip the end of the caustic in water, and to rub it on the part, till the skin becomes brown. The active substance is then to be immediately washed off with some wet tow, the plaster is to be removed, and an emollient poultice applied. This method of opening abscesses is very seldom war- rantable. If it be advantageous in any case, it is when there is a small collection of matter surrounded by a good deal of indolent hardness. Jt is much against the practice that it is impossible to prescribe any precise boundary to the action of the caustic, and that, unless the eschar be made sufficiently deep, the lancet must after all be used. Caustic also leaves behind a disagreeable scar, a consider- ation of considerable importance in abscesses about the necks and faces of females. The eschar is sometimes ten or twelve tedious days before its detachment happens. TOPICAL APPLICATIONS TO PHLEGMONOUS ABSCESSES. The best applications to phlegmonous abscesses are fo- mentations and poultices. While the skin covering (he collection of matter continues entire, they are the best dressings, because they favour the relaxation of the skin, and accelerate the progress of the matter to the surface of the body. When the abscess has been opened, or has spontaneously burst, they are the most proper applications; for they promote the continuance of suppuration, without which granulations cannot be produced to fill up the ca- vity. After inflammation has arrived at a certain pitch, cold

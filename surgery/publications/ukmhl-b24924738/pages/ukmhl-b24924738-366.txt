FIRST LINES OF THE .324 though a fatal hemorrhage succeeded, the great decrease in the size of the gland, before death, is a sufficient encou- ragement to repeat the trial, particularly as the method of applying ligatures round large arteries is now brought into a very improved state. If the femoral, and even the exter- nal iliac arteries will heal, when tied in the manner recom- mended by Mr. Abernethy, avc can entertain no doubt that the superior thyroideal will do so. CHAP. XXVIII. WOUNDS OF THE THORAX ARE divided into such as do not penetrate, and into others which do penetrate that cavity. The former do not differ in their nature from common wounds; and therefore do not demand particular conside- ration. Cuts and sabre wounds hardly ever interest the parts contained in the chest; stabs and gunshot wounds are the ordinary kinds of violence by which the thoracic viscera are injured. Wounds which simply penetrate the chest, without wounding any contained part, are often unaccompanied by any material consequences. It is frequently difficult to pronounce positively, whether a wound extends into the cavity of the thorax or not. Many punctured wounds are very long and narrow, so as not easily to admit a probe to their termination. Many are made when the patient is in a posture which you can- not precisely ascertain, and in which alone their track can be traced by a probe. But if the symptoms do not indi- cate any difference between a superficial wound of the chest, and one which just enters its cavity, no practical good can result from knowing to which description it an-

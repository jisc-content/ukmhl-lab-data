FIRST LINES OF THE 513 rami; either on one side or both ; it may also be fractured near its symphysis ; and the injuries may, in some in- stances, be only mere solutions of continuity ; while, in others, they may be comminuted fractures, that is, cases in â€¢which the bone is broken into several pieces. Fractures of the lower jaw are usually not at all displaced, when these injuries occur near the angle of the bone ; for then the pterygoid, temporal, and masseter, muscles, retaining the posterior part, the digastric, and other musclps, cannot dra w downward the body of the bone. A fracture of the lower jaw may be detected by intro- ducing' a linger into the mouth, ami pressing on the front teeth of tiie side on which the fracture is supposed to be, while, at the same time, the fingers of the other hand are applied to the basis of the hone, near the angle. On mak- ing alternate pressure in each of the above situations, the bone may be felt to move, or even a crepitus may be distin- guished When the fracture is displaced the diagnosis is still more easy. In tins case the body of the bone is drawn do .ward Irom the ranus ; the mouth is more or less open, and drawn to one side, in such a manner, that the commissure ol the lips, is much lower on the side where the fracture is, than ou the other ; while the front tee h are much below the level of the back ones. When one end of the fracture projects forward, and passes over the other, the mouth is more disfigured On the side, towards the injury; it forms a projection forward, and the teeth are not arranged in a regular, semicircular manner. TREATMENT. When tjie fracture is not displaced, the surgeon need only adapt some pasteboard, wet and softened in vinegar, to the outside of the jaw, both along its side, and under its basis. Over this wet pasteboard, a bandage with four tails is to be applied, the centre being placed on the pa- tient's chili, the two posterior tails pinned to the front part

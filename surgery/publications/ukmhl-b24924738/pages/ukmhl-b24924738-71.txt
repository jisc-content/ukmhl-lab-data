PRACTICE OF SURGERY, 41 CHAP. X. BURNS. BURNS may be divided into four degrees :* J. In the mildest, there is but a slight redness without swelling, and only a gentle inflammation is excited, ihat shortly subsides. 2. In the second degree the redness'is attended with swelling; the pain is severe ; and if the burn be of much extent, there is fever. The inflammation is acute, but it commonly ends in resolution. 3. In the third degree, vesicles containing a clear or yellow fluid, arise either in a sudden or gradual manner. The sympathetic fever is severe ; the pain is intolerable ; and suppuration can seldom be prevented. 4. In the fourth the burnt part, is mortified. This hap- pens either at the moment of the accident, or in conse- quence of violent inflammation. The quantity of injury depends on the degree of heat in the burning substances; on the duration and extent of their application ; and on the sensibility of the burnt pari. The danger is proportioned to the extent as well as to the violence of the burn ; hence, even cases of the fourth kind, and of little extent, may be insignificant, while others of the first description, and of great extent, may be very perilous. As heated fluids part with their caloric in being dif- fused, scalds are often attended with various degrees of in- jury at different parts. In the human subject, the skin and lungs are both des- tined to separate trorn the circulation an aqueous exhala- tion, and perhaps it is on account of those parts parti- cipating in t he same function, tl;at extensive burns seem

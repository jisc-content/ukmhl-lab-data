At last, the hydrocele so conceals the testicle, that this body can only be distinguished, at the upper and back part of the tumour, by a certain hard feel. The spermatic cord, however, is still quite obvious to the touch. Though the swelling may have acquired its greatest size, and the scrotum be considerably distended, the corrugations of the latter part are seldom so obliterated as in the anasarcou$ hydrocele. The penis seems small, and, as it were, sunk in the tumour. The integuments of the scrotum also acquire an increased thickness ; the veins appear large, and there is rather a sense of elasticity than of fluctuation, communicated to the surgeon’s fingers. The spermatic cord itself even becomes somewhat con- cealed, when the hydrocele has ascended very far. In these cases, the tunica vaginalis always becomes more and more thickened, which change is common to all mem- branes when they are long distended. TREATMENT. The h}rdrocele of the tunica vaginalis is relieved either in a palliative or radical manner. ‘*r ; • 1 . I PALLIATIVE CUKE. / This consists in merely puncturing the tumour with a lancet, or trocar, for the purpose of evacuating the fluid. The latter instrument, when small, is always to be prefer- red, as the cannula facilitates the escape of the water, and prevents its diffusing itself in the cellular texture of the scrotum. The palliative treatment ought first to be prac- tised, when the hydrocele is of an immense size, and the radical cure should not be undertaken, till the tumour has acquired about two-thirds of ils former magnitude. When the radical cure of a very large and extremely tense hy«

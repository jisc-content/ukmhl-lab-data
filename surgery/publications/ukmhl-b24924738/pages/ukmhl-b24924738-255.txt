221 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. longitudinal sinus Las often been purposely punctured, and the bleeding never proved troublesome. You cannot safely apply the trephine lower down in front than half an inch above the superciliary ridge of the os frontis, nor over the frontal sinuses. If requisite the trephine may be ap- plied to the squamous portion of the temporal bone ; for -wounds of the temporal muscles are now not so much dreaded as they were by our prejudiced ancestors. There are only two small spaces on each side of the groove for the longitudinal sinus, which can he safely trephined in the occipital bone, and here it would be advisable to use a small trephine. When the bone is already sufficiently exposed by a wound, the operation may commence at once ; but other- wise, it is first requisite to make room for the application of the trephine by making an incision of a crucial form, or shaped like the letters T or V. None of the scalp should ever be removed, as it is quite unnecessary, and might oc- casion afterwards serious deformity. The incision should be made down to the bone at once ; but in the case of large fractures, attended with great sepa- ration of the broken edges, or with loose pieces, the danger of pressingtoo hard w ith the scalping knife is obvious. Mr. Pott informs us, that a suture, or the impression of a vessel on the surface of the bone, may be discriminated from a fracture or fissure, by the undetached state of the pericranium. This membrane is always found loose and detached from the track of a fracture ; besides which, the edges of a fracture are always found rough to the probe, or finger. The natural situation of the sutures is also a source of information to a surgeon, who is not deficient in anatomical knowledge. It would be dangerous to apply the crown of the tre- phine on depressed portions of the skull. The perfora- tion is always to be made on that side of the fraci ure at which the elevator may be most conveniently ..introduced

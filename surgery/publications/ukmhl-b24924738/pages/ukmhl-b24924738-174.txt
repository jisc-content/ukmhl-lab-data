It is P°S , to co,lceive> howewr, that when original parts are enlarged, the morbid change may be owing to an im- perfect absorption, and not to any wrong action of the bloou vessels. But in cases of tumours which are quite , lS U1Ct’ a‘ld whlch constituted no original part of the °dj’ thc formation of tlie disease is probably always the result ot a morbid state of the surrounding arteries. 1 he process by which sarcomatous tumours, and indo- lent indurations, and thickenings, are formed, is termed chrome inflammation. The blood vessels, which we must generally suppose to be the active organs in these cases, de- posd a superfluous quantity of new matter; and to do so they must assume an increased action, though not of that throbbing sort which happens in cases of acute inflamma- tion. It is very likely that coagulating lymph is the first kind ot matter which is thrown out from the vessels in cases of sarcomatous tumours : that it then becomes vascular itself, and-is converted by the action of its own vessels into the various kinds of morbid structure already mentioned.. In proportion as a tumour increases in size, it compresses i ie suiiounding cellular substance, which becomes con- verted into a kind of membranous capsule, surrounding he swelling. In sarcomatous cases the cyst is, in ge- neral, thin ; and sometimes there is even no cyst what- ever. 1 he grou th of indolent tumours does not derange the constitution; they form in an insidious manner without increased heat, and generally without any uneasiness in the part.

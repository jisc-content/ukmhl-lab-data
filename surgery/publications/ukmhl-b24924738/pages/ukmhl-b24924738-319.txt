The disease is either complete, or incomplete; inveterate, or recent; continued, or periodical. SYMPTOMS, VARIETIES, &C. Almost all the symptoms of a gutta serena are falla- cious. In many cases the pupil is dilated, immoveable, and retains its natural black colour and transparency. But sometimes, in the most complete and incurable gutta se- rena, the pupil is of its natural size, and, in a few instances, is capable of motion. The pupil of an eye, affected with this malady, seldom exhibits the clear, shining blackness, which is seen in a healthy state of this organ ; for the most part, this aperture has a dull, glassy, or horny appearance. Sometimes its colour is greenish. In some instances it gcems whitish and opaque, so as to be mistaken for an in- cipient cataract. The white appearance in the pupil ge- nerally arises from a reflection of light from the retina, in consequence of this membrane having lost its. natural trans- parency. Richter mentions strabismus as the only symptom inva- riably connected with amaurosis. The blindness, produced by the gulta serena, is generally preceded by an appearance of numerous insects, or sub- stances like pieces of cobwebs, interposing themselves be- tween objects and the eye. The origin of a cataract, on the other hand, is usually attended with a simple cloudi- ness in vision.

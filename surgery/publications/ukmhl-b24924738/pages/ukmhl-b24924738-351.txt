309 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. Transverse wounds of the trachea, which have not di- vided it completely through, may, in most instances, he cured by the strict observance of a proper position. By bringing the patient’s chin downward and forward to the sternum, and maintaining the head in this posture by the support of pillows, the edges of the wound in the trachea may be placed, and kept in contact until they have grown together. The manner in which sutures aggravate the cough, and inflame the wound, often necessitates the surgeon to with- draw them when they have been employed. Besides the irritation, which, as extraneous bodies, they Create in the trachea, they arc, to say the best of them, in general ver> unnecessary. Nothing prevents a wound of the trachea from uniting more than the disturbance ot a convulsive cough, and the irritation of sutures always increases this hurtful symptom in a much greater degree than they do good by maintaining the edges of the wound in contact. In fact, when the whole trachea is not completely divided, there never can be such a space between the edges ot the wound, that they cannot be brought into contact by the assistance of a proper posture. When the troublesome cough seems be ow ing to an in- flammatory state of the wound, the complaint may be mi- tigated by bldeding and soo -dug remedies. In cases where there does not appear to be any particular local ir- ritation to account for the violent coughing, lluv almond emulsion, spermaceti mixture, and opium, may be given with beneficial effect. To prevent the entrance of (he discharge and blood into the trachea, it has been directed to make the patient lie on his side instead of his back. However, nothing prevents these occurrences more, than keeping the edges ot Ihe wound accurately in contact, and the patient’s head may be much more steadily supported forward, when he lies ou his back, than when be is ou his side.

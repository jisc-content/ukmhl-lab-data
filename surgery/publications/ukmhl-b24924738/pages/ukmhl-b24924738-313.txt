PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 275 hypopium never fails to enlarge; as soon as this stage ceases, and the op'htlmlmy becomes connected with local weakness, the hypopium leaves off increasing, and from that moment is disposed to diminish* TREATMENT* During the first stage of the violent ophthalmy, while the hypopium is increasing, the same treatment, as is re- commended for severe acute inflammation of the eye, is the most proper. In the second stage of the ophthalmy, when the hypopium has become stationary, surgeons, little versed in the treatment of diseases of the eyes, would sup- pose. that an opening ought to be made in the most depend- ing part of the cornea. But experience proves* that di- viding this membrane, in cases of hypopium, is seldom suc- cessful, and most frequently gives rise to evils worse than the hypopium itself, viz. the reproduction of violent oph- thalmy ; a greater effusion of matter into the chambers of the aqueous humour; and an ulcer of the cornea, attended with prolapsus of the iris. Scarpa only admits (he pro- priety of making an opening in one particular case, which is when the quantity of extra v a sated matter is so consider- able, that the excessive distention, which it produces of all the coats of the eye, occasions such vehement symp- toms, as not 01 dy threaten the entire destruction of the or- gan, but even endanger life. From knowing, that blood, extravasated in the eye in consequence oi blows, that the fragments of membranous cataracts, that milky and caseous cataracts, nay, that the firm crystalline lens ilself, can be totally removed by the lymphatics, we may easily conclude, that the resolution of an hypopium, by means ol absorption, is the primary indi- cation to which the surgeon should direct his attention. After subduing the violence ot the ophthalmy by the most rigorous employment of the antiphlogistic treatment, the surgeon must endeavour to quicken the action of the abr t 2

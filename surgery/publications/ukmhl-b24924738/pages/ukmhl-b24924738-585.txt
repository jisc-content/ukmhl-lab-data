PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 541 •with a dislocated jaw is placed, that very severe com- plaints, and even death, may follow the accident, if no as- sistance should be given. In reducing a dislocated jaw, the surgeon is to make the bone act as a lever, in moving the displaced condyles. The thumbs, well covered with a thick pair of gloves, are to be introduced, as far backward as possible, along the grinding teeth. Then, with the fingers and palms of his hands, the practitioner is to take firmly hold of each side of the dislocated bone, and while he depresses the condyles with his thumbs, he is to elevate the chin. These two ac- tions co operate to produce the same'effect. As soon as the condyles are freed from the confined situation, beneath the zygoma, the contraction of all the muscles, which are concerned in shutting the jaw, almost at the same in- stant, both draws the condyloid processes back into their natural situation, and forcibly closes the mouth, so that the surgeon’s thumbs would be in danger of being bitten, if care were not taken to cover them with thick gloves, and withdraw them, immediately the reduction is effected. When only one condyle is dislocated, the same plan of re- ducing the part is applicable to the side, on which the ac- cident is situated. Reduction having been accomplished, the patient should, for some time afterwards, avoid all such actions as laughing, yawning, &c. and the jaw should be supported by a bandage with four tails, in the same way as was re- commended for the fractured lower jaw. DISLOCATION OF TIIL HEAD. The os oecipitis is so firmly connected with the first cervical vertebra, or atlas, that it is hardly posssible, that any separation should originate from external force. How- ever, the articulation of the atlas and deutata, that is, of the first and second vertebras, not being so strong, either a dislocation forward may occur, in consequence of a rup-

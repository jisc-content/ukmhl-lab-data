PRACTICE OF SURGERY, 201 When therefore a limb is broken, and the event is not manifest from the distortion of the part, it is proper to trace with the fingers the out-lines of the suspected bone, and wherever any unusual pain occurs, or any unnatural irregularity appears, to try if no grating, or crepitus, can be felt on endeavouring to make one end of the bone rub against the other. When the os humeri, or os femoris, is the subject of injury, a crepitus is felt almost as soon as the limb is touched, and in the case of the thigh, there is con- siderable shortening of the extremity, unless the fracture be of the transverse kind. But when there are two bones, as in the leg and fore-arm, and only one is broken, the other continues to prevent the limb from being shortened, and thrown out of its natural shape, so that a crepitus can only be felt by a proper examination with the fingers. I am aware that considerable harm, and great unnecessary pain, have been occasioned in the practice of surgery by an over-officious care to feel the grating of fractured bones, find whenever the case is sufficiently evident to the eyes, I cannot refrain from censuring those practitioners who indulge their own ill-judged habits at the ex pence of torture to the unfortunate patient. A fracture is an in- jury that is necessarily attended with considerable pain, and followed by a great deal of tension, and to increase these evils by rough handling of the part is above all things cruel, and, I would add, unsurgical. In cases of fractures the muscles of the limb are often af- fectcd witli involuntary spasms, which put the patient to great pain, and when the thigh-bone, arm-bone, or both bones of the leg, or fore-arm, are broken, occasion great distortion, while the violence of each spasm continues. PROCESS BY WHICH FRACTURES ARE UNITED. The steps of nature, in the union of broken bones, are very similar to those which she pursues in the union of wounds of the soft parts. The vessels ramifying on the ends of the fracture first effuse coagulating lymph. This

m . FIRST LINES- OF THE its upper part. This method, it'is obvious, would leave two very inconvenient flaps, or angles. The best modern operators, in this metropolis, prefer cir- . cumcisipn. The prepuce is taken hold of with a pair ol forceps, and, as much of the part being left out as seems necessary to be removed, the surgeon cuts a complete circle of the prepuce off by one stroke of the knife. The exter- nal layer of the skin of the prepuce is then usually pre- vented from becoming separated from the inner one by a fine suture, introduced through both their edges. TREATMENT OF THE PA R APHYMOSIS. This case may very often be at once relieved, by com- pressing as much of the blood as possible out of the glans penis, and then pushing the part back again through the stricture. In order to perform this operation adroitly, the surgeon should first make continued pressure on the glans, by placing it between the ends of the thumb, index, and middle fingers, of each hand. The whole surface of the part should thus be gradually-compressed, at the same time, for the space of four, or five minutes. Then, the two thumbs are to be employed, both in pushing backward the diminished glans, and, together with the fingers, in draw- ing forward the prepuce. I cannot say, that I have ever seen more than one case, in which this plan, when properly tried, did not succeed. When the attempt fails, leeches should be applied to the glans, and the flow of blood be afterwards promoted by immersing the penis in warm water. Frequently, the above (incthod will succeed, after such measures. However, if it should not, and no danger of gangrene should be present, the surgeon must be content with covering the penis with linen, kept constantly wet. When the cedematouS' swelling increases, instead of di- minishing, the only method of preventing mortification &i the glans and prepuce, is to make an incision just behind

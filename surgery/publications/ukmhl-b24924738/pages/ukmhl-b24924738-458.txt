4lG FIRST LINES OF THE largement. The pain, which sympathetic swellings of the glands occasion, is much less, than that arising from the true veneieal bubo. Such swellings also seldom suppu- rate. Mr. Hunter was of opinion, that a real venereal bubo might sometimes tako place, in a case of gonorrhoea, in consequence of the absorption of matter. TREATMENT. W hatever may be the nature of the sympathetic bubo, certain it is, that mercury is by no means necessary in the treatment. The swelling may be reduced by the repeated application of leeches, and keeping up a continual evapo- ration from the part, by means of linen, wet in the satur- nine lotion. In short-, the case is to be treated as a simple phlegmonous inflammation. BLADDER AFFECTED IN GONORMItEA. Opiate clysters, the warm bath, phlebotomy, if the pa- tient be young and robust, and leeches applied to the peri- neum, are the most eligible measures to be adopted. In cases, in which the alfection continues very long, an opiate plaster may be applied to the loins, or a small blister to the perineum. When the irritability of the bladder exists alone, and for a long while, opiate clysters, cicuta, bark, seabathing, and a blister on the perineum, are proper. A scruple, or half a dram of the powder of uva ursi, has been recommended to be given, three times a da}7, when the bladder is extremely irritable, in consequence of a go~ norrheea.

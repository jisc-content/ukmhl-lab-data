FIRST LINES OF THE ns polypus becomes gradually larger, so as at length to fill the nose incessantly, and even to cause an external protru- sion. The excrescence projects forward into the nostril; extends backward to the throat, where it has more space ; and, in general, soon enlarges in such a manner thatitaev quires the form of a cylinder, which terminates, before and behind, in an irregular protuberance. The anteriour pro- tuberance expands the nostril, and occasions great defor- mity ; the posteriour one obstructs deglutition, and, ulti- mately, respiration. The polypus, still continuing its progress, elevates the ossa nasi, and separates them from each other; it hinders the passage of the tears into the nose, and thus produces a fistula lachrymulis; and it pushes the septum nasi towards the opposite side, thereby creating not only great deformity, but also a gradual clo- sure of the other nostril. In a still more advanced state it distends powerfully the whole cavity of the nose, giving rise to severe pains, which, extend over the greatest part of the head; exciting inflammation, and ulceration of the Schneiderian membrane, and causing caries of the sur-» rounding bones, together with a most fetid discharge. It is easy to discern, that when the necessary measures are de- layed the disease may at last acquire an incurable pitch, and from the extent of the caries even prove fatal. Some polypi are very prone to bleed profusely, and thereby they not unfrequently cause excessive debility. TREATMENT OF THE FLESHY POLYPUS QF THE NOSE. » f A solution of sal ammoniac, frequently injected into the nostril, is asserted to have effected a dispersion of the tu- mour. But this practice cannot have been attended with much success ; for it would soon have superseded the ne- i cessity of adopting more painful measures. / EXTRACTION. Polypi may either be extracted, tied, or destroyed by

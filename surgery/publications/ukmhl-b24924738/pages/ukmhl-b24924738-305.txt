All three consist of a varicose state of the vessels of the conjunctiva, over a certain extent of this membrane, together with a degree of relaxation of the tunic itself. In the chronic varicose ophthalmy, the preternatural magni- tude, and knottiness of the veins, and the relaxation of the conjunctiva arc confined to the white'of the eye; in the nebula the vessels of the conjunctiva arc dilated and knotty even over some part of the delicate layer of this membrane,' coveringthe transparent portion of the eve : in the ptery- gium to the varicose state of the vessels on the surface of the cornea, is added a thickening of the lamina of the conjunctiva spread over this membrane. Avery peculiar feature of the pterygium is the facility with which it may be taken hold of with a pair of forceps, and raised in a fold over the cornea. It is worthy of no- tice, however, that sometimes the pterygium assumes a ma- lignant cancerous nature, and then it has a bright red co- lour, like sealing w ax, easily bleeds when touched,' is firm- ly adherent to the cornea, and occasions lancinating pains, which extend over (he whole eye and temple. Scarpa re- commends this case to be treated on the palliative plan ; but it seepis questionable, whether it might no! be proper to attempt the total excision of the malady ; if the trial should fail, we might (hen extirpate the eye; an operation truly horrible, but one, which would certainly become inevit- able, it the malignant pterygium were allowed to increase, and one, which can be avoided by no other means, than an effort to extirpate the recent disease. TREATMENT OF THE PTERYCJ lUtwl The cure is performed by accurately cutting away the opaque triangular membrane from the surface of the cor- nea. As the pterygium itself is the delicate layer of the conjunctiva, forming the natural covering of the cornea, a cicatrix, and a degree ot dimness, necessarily remain after

~i4 , FIRST LINES OF THE brcc cannot be easily opened in the morning, owing to a morbid secretion of glutinous matter. The most successful treatment is to wash the eye fre- quently in the day time with a .vitriolic collyrium, and to melt a little of the unguent, hydrarg. nit. in a spoon, and smear it over the inner surface and edges of the eyelids every night, just before the patient goes to bed. This can be best done with a hair pencil. In many instances the complaint is very obstinate, and requires the internal exhibition of alterative medicines. PURULENT EYES OF INFANTS. In new-born children a peculiar inflammation of the eye- lids is sometimes seen ; they become red and swolltm,*and a yellow, thick, purulent matter is discharged, which sometimes covers the whole front of the eye-ball. When the child cries, or any attempt is made to inspect its eye, the eyelids become everted. As it often happens that the eyelids cannot be opened, the matter is apt to accumulate underneath them, and excite inflammation, abscesses, and opacities of the eye itself. This case is relieved by a camphorated lotion made ac- cording to the following formula : & Cupri vitriol. Bol. armen. a a giv. Camphor, ^j. M. F. pulvis, de quo projice Jj in aqua: bullientis Jbiv. remove ab igne et subsideant feces. % One dram of this remedy is to be mixed with an ounce of cold clear water. The application may be diluted, or strengthened if requisite. The best mode of applying it to the inside of the eyelids is with a syringe, and, in vio- lent cases, this should be done oneeor twice every hour. Mr. Ware also recommends the eyelids to be covered with a poultice made of the curds of milk, coagulated with alum, and an equal part of unguent. sambuci. or axungia porcini.

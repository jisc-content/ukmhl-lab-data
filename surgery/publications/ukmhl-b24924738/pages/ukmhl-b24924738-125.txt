PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 93 r'*~ . i . CHAP. XX. OF POISONED WOUNDS. AS poisoned weapons are not made use of among civi- lized nations, and venomous animals are not numerous in this country, we have not many oppoilunilies of observing poisoned wounds. The most common wounds of this description are the stings of gnats, wasps, bees, and hornets. The bites of mad animals, and of the viper, are the most serious. It is highly probable that the poison, insinuated into wounds, does not always derange the whole system merely in consequence of absorption. 1 lie constitute.nal symp- toms would seem sometimes to happen per consensus, be- fore the local poison has had time to find its way into the circulation, as in the bite of the cobra de capello of the East Indies, and the American rattle-snake. Hence in the treatment of all severe poisoned wounds two chief indica- tions arise: 1. To prevent absorption of the poison and its alarming effects, either by quickly cleansing the wound from it, or by rendering its qualities inert. 2. To appease the sympathetic disorder of the constitution by medicines of the sedative and anlispasmodic kind. Various are the means that have been used to fulfil the first object. Scarifying and cupping the wound ; suc- tion ; the actual cautery ; setting fire to gunpowder placed in the part; different kinds of oil; powdered cantharides, and excision of the injured part, are the principal ones. The second indication demands the internal exhibition of opium, the volatile alkali, camphor, musk, and similar remedies. STINGS OF INSECTS. Bees, wasps, hornets, and other insects of this country,

PRACTICE OF SURGERY. 139 gradually detached in the form of sloughs. Hemorrhage succeeds the separation of each slough, and can only be suppressed by means of continued pressure. After all the dead portions have been thrown off, the skin heals, and continues cicatrized till the distension of another gland re- news the foregoing process', and the patient is at length exhausted. Dissections after death evince, that the glands in the pelvis and abdomen are affected with the same disease. Mr. Abernethy relates a case, in which a tumour, par- taking of this structure, formed on the thigh. The base of the disease was situated near the bone. The lymphatic glands in the ham, pelvis, and loins, were all affected w ith the same morbid enlargement. These circumstances were ascertained after death. The facility with which medullary sarcoma is propa- gated along the absorbent vessels, is one of its more striking peculiarities, Mr. Abernethy adds another species of sarcoma, wnicli he calls "carcinomatous. This I shall omit in the present chapter, because the name docs not properly enter into the above arrangement, which is founded on the anatomical structure of tumours; and because carcinoma cannot al- ways be considered as a tumour, the diseased part fre- quently being- shrunk, and even smaller than in the healthy state ; and lastly, because cancer is a sufficiently important subject for a separate chapter. or THE GROWTH OF SARCOMATOUS TUMOURS, AND OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. Every kind of fleshy tumour, every enlargement of an original part of the body, can only be the effect of an un- natural action in the vessels. Whatever matter is depo- sited in the interstices of a gland, or any other part, must be placed there by those secerning arteries, which, in the healthy state, only secrete a sufficient quantity of new par-

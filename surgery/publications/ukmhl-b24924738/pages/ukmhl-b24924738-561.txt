519 PRACTICE OF SURGERY. of a night cap, and the two anterior ones attached to a part of the same cap, more backward. When the pasteboard becomes dry, it forms the most convenient thing imagin- able for incasing, and supporting the fracture. A piece of soap plaster may now be applied to the skm underneath. When the anterior part of the bone is lower than the back portion, the index finger is to be introduced to the base of the coronoid process, which is to-be gradually pushed backward, while the index and middle fingers of the other hand are to be applied to the front teeth, and the thumb to the basis of the anterior part of the jaw. At the same moment, that the coronoid process is pushed back- ward, the front portion of the bone is to be raised. W hen oneeinl'of the fracture is situated over the other, the two parts of the bone are to be pushed in opposite directions, and, on this being skilfully done, the slightest pressure on the extremities of the fracture will suffice for placing them in contact. When any teeth are driven out of their sockets, they should be immediately introduced again, and, if necessary, tied to the adjoining teeth, by means of a piece of Catgut, or gold wire. However, when the displaced tooth belongs to the very situation, at which (he fracture has occurred, it is generally thought most advisable to remove it alto- gether. The extremities of the fracture having been placed in even contact, the jaw is to be incased in pasteboard, and the four-tailed bandage applied. It will also be necessary to counteract the action of muscles, between the lower ja w and os hyoides, by supporting the front portion of the bone with compresses placed under the bandage. The artery, running in the cannlis mentalis, is often ruptured in these cases, and the hemorrhage is very copi- ous : however, I have never seen a case, in which the bleeding did not cease, on the fractured ends of the bone being placed in a state of apposition.

A very small pair of forceps is commonly employed for extracting tire capsule itself, when deprived of its natural transparency. CHAP. XIX. RANULA. ' THIS is a tumour arising from a distention of the sali- vary duct underneath the tongue, and from an accumula- tion of the saliva in the dilated part. 1 he cause ot this malady is probably owing to a stoppage of the orifice of the salivary duct. The swelling is usually situated on one side of the freemum linguaj, and particularly when it is large, sometimes extends under the apex of the tongue. The tumour consists of a sac, which is composed of the di- lated portion of the duct, and is either filled with clear sa- liva, a purulent fluid, or an earthy substance. Its size va- ries considerably in different cases, from that of a pea to that of a hen’s egg. It may become so very large, and ele- vate the tongue so much, that deglutition and respiration are greatly obstructed, and its pressure may even render the lower jaw-bone carious. Some swellings of this kind have been known to contain a pint of matter. Sometimes ranulce arc quite free from pain ; in some in- stances they are very painful, when the tongue is moved ; and in others they are in an inflamed state. Encysted tumours arc liable to form under the tongue, and cannot easily be distinguished from ranulce ; but this is of no importance, as the same plan of treatment is appli- cable to both diseases.

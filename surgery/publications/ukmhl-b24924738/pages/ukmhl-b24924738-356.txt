FIRST LINES OF THE 314 The sponge is then to be introduced down the oesophagus beyond the foreign body, and water is to be injected through the tube, in order to moisten the sponge and make it expand. After tliis the ends of the ligaturearc to be firmly drawn, for the purpose oi pressing the sponge against the extre- mity of the cannula to make it expand still more. Then the tube is to be withdrawn, together with The sponge* observing to twist the instrument to the right and left, in this part of the operation. When the foreign substance cannot be extracted with this instrument, a probang may be tried, to the end of which a bunch of thread, doubled so as to make an im- mense number of nooses, is fastened. Little bodies may frequently become entangled, and be extracted in this way, when the other one fails. Some practitioners are in the habit of giving emetics ; but this practiceis very improper when the foreign body is angular or pointed, and is seldom of much use in any case, as patients usually' make eflbrls to vomit of their own accord. When foreign bodies in the oesophagus produce urgent sym.ptÂ°ms,aml cannot be extracted, it becomes necessary to push the extraneous substances into (lie stomach, let them be of any kind whatsoever. The surgeon may the more readily adopt this plan, as experience shews, that such bodies, as one would imagine likely to produce very alarm- ing symptoms, when pushed into the stomach, very often occasion no dangerous symptoms, and even not the smallest inconvenience. A whalebone probang is the common and most convenient instrument for forcing substances down the oesophagus into the sfomaoh. When foreign bodies in the oesophagus can neither be extracted, nor pushed downward, the consequences are various. Sometimes the patient is soon suffocated. In other instances, inflammation and sloughing take place in

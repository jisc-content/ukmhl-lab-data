SOS FIRST LINES OF THE : / i the phalanges, on account of the dense firm structure of the tendinous sheath. The fourth kind of whitlow extends to the periosteum and bone. The complaint is attended with an acute, deep-seated pain, and a swelling, which is more confined to the phalanx affected, than the tumefaction accompany- ing other whitlows. On an incision being made to dis- charge the fluid, this is found lodged beneath the periosr team, while the bone is, also, for the most part, discovered to be rough and carious. When whitlows are very severe, the throbbing of the arteries extends, for a considerable distance, up the arm, and the febrile symptoms are considerable. Whitlows often originate from external causes, such as jaruises, pricks, &c. but, in general, we find, that the com- plaint occurs, without being preceded by any assignable cause whatever. TREATMENT. Topical applications of two very opposite classes have been recommended, viz. fomentations, poultices, and all sorts of emollient remedies; and vinegar, spirits, and astringent applications in general. Excepting in the first case of whitlow, the formation of matter seems to be productive of no relief, and experience evinces, that there is no advantage in promoting the event. It is even certain, that the pain is increased by the accu- mulation of fluid. When matter is already collected, no benefit whatever is ever derived from emollients, espe- cially when the whitlow is deep, for then the fluid never partakes of (be nature of pus.

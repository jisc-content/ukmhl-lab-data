VOLUNTARY MUSCLE IN THE LIVING BODY. 55 normal sound; and the appearance and feel of a muscle thus rigidly convulsed, can be perfectly simulated for a short period by an act of volition.* I therefore conclude, from the whole of the preceding remarks, combined with the facts and arguments advanced in my former paper, that the contraction of voluntary muscle is not a sustained act of the whole congeries of contractile elements composing it; but a rapid series of partial acts, in which all duly share, becoming by turns contracted and relaxed. King's College, London. April 6, 1841. The figure represents a portion of a primitive fasciculus, taken from among many others, from the complexus muscle, where it was ecchyniosed and had lost in a great measure its fibrous appearance. At (a) a fusiform contracted portion, with the striee remarkably close. On either hand the sarcous elements are much stretched (6), or even entirely disarranged (c, c, c), while at (cZ) there is a transverse rupture within the sarcolemma, and at (e) this sheath itself has given way. * I yesterday, in company with my friend, Professor Todd, discovered the same appearances of partial contractions in the recti muscles of the abdomen, ruptured by violent straining in diarrhoea. The voluntary muscles of the whole body were infested with the Trichina Spiralis, and were enfeebled.â€” August 2, 1841.

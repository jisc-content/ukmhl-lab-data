Its lobes are much thinner at their convex border, opposite the hilus, than elsewhere. The tubes are consequently much shorter there, and I have remarked that the Malpighian tufts are also much smaller. This correspondence between the size of the Malpighian bodies and the length of the tubes, throws much light on the function of the former. A further study of the varieties here displayed in the size of the Malpighian tufts seems highly desirable. Eeflecting on this remarkable structure of the Malpighian bodies, and on their singular connection with the tubes, I was led to speculate on their use. It occurred to me that as the tubes and their plexus of capillaries were probably, for reasons presently to be stated, the parts concerned in the secretion of that portion of the urine to which its characteristic properties are due (the urea, lithic acid, &c), the Malpighian bodies might be an apparatus destined to separate from the blood the watery portion. This view, on .further consideration, appears so consonant with facts, and with analogy, that I shall in a few words state to the Society the reasons that l 2

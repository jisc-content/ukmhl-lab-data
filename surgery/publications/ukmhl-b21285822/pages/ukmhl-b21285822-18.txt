xii PREFATORY MEMOIR. be led to feel that there is always abundant material at hand which will well repay intelligently directed observation, whilst he may rest assured that nothing would have given their author greater pleasure than that his own work, retold, had led a younger generation to more profound and careful investigation of nature and to knowledge more precise and certain than that to which he had himself attained.

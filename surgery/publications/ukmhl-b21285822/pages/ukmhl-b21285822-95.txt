51 ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE CONTRACTION OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE IN THE LIVING BODY. By William Bowman, Esq., F.E.S., Societ. Philomath. Paris. Corvesp., Demonstrator of Anatomy in King's College, London, and Assistant Surgeon to the King's College Hospital. Received April 15—Read April 29, 1841. In my paper of June last, published in the Philosophical Transactions,* I showed, by observations on the Rigor Mortis, that contraction, in voluntary muscle, essentially consists of an approximation and change of form of the minute particles composing its structure. The phenomena of contraction in living Monoculi and Arguli were also briefly adverted to, but it remained undecided in what manner these minute movements are employed in the higher animals, in the production of motion during life. The almost insurmountable difficulty of submitting the living muscle of the Vertebrata to high powers of the microscrope, so much enhances the value of any facts bearing on this obscure point, that I am induced to lay before the Society a short account of some recent examinations of human tetanic muscle, which, with the considerations accompanying them, appear to me to afford conclusive evidence on the subject. Two opportunities have lately occurred to me of carefully observing the conditions of the muscular system, in cases of fatal tetanus, and the following has been the result:— 1. Many muscles appear healthy in all respects. 2. Parts of certain muscles present a remarkably pale grey aspect, arising, doubtless, from their blood having been pressed out by the contraction, a state of which the appearance has been aptly compared by my friend Professor Budd, to that of the flesh of fishes. 3. In other situations, the muscles have lost in a great measure their fine fibrous character, and present a soft mottled surface, which readily tears, or receives * Part II., 1840. H 2

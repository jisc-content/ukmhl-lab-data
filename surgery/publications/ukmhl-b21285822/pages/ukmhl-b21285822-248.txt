200 ELEMENTARY TISSUES OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. Of the Elementary Tissues Appended to the Mucous System. The two elementary tissues now described may be considered as the more essential constituents of the mucous system, or as forming the simple mucous membrane. This simple mucous membrane envelopes the rest of the body. It contains within its own substance neither vessels nor nerves, but is, strictly speaking, extra-vascular. By modifications, chiefly of the epithelial element, it is in itself capable of presenting great variety of appearance and properties in different situations. But in immediate connection with its deep surface, that is, with the basement membrane, there are certain tissues common to almost every part of the frame, but here assuming a peculiar arrangement and office, and by their diversities in various localities, occasioning the most complicated varieties of outward form, of structure, and of function. a, a, arteries; b, b, vein?. FIG. 285. CAPILLARIES ON THE RECTUM OF THE FROG. These appended tissues are minute bloodvessels, a lymphatic network, nerves, and areolar tissue. It has been already stated that in many parts the simple mucous membraue, by its innumerable minute involutions over an extensive surface, is formed into a compound membrane. Into the composition of this (of which a good example is afforded by that of the stomach) the appended tissues enter more or less largely, but they are likewise, in addition, generally spread out in great abundance as a layer underneath the compound membrane. This layer has been commonly termed submucous cellular membrane (sometimes tunica nervea), in the case of internal surfaces, and cutis vera or dermis in the case of the skin.

PREFACE TO YOLUME I The first volume of the Collected Papers of the late Sir William Bowman contains the whole of the epoch-making researches which he accomplished between forty and fifty years ago in the field which he himself—regarding the discovery of the functions and uses of parts as the main purpose of anatomical investigation— designated as that of ' Physiological Anatomy.' It would have been useful to the biological student to have brought the discoveries recorded in Bowman's first communications to the Eoyal Society into contrast with the obscure and unsatisfactory descriptions and statements of the writers on the same subjects who immediately preceded him. It would have been still more interesting to have shown how the inferences drawn by him from the minute structure of secreting glands, after having been for many years disputed, have now been established on the safer basis of physiological experiment, or how the descrip- tions and drawings made by him half a century ago relating to the minute structure of muscle, are consistent with, and might even be said to foreshadow, the most recent revelations of modern histology. Under his guidance, and with his sanction, I should have been glad to have attempted both of the tasks I have indicated, but it is now impossible. In presenting the following Memoirs to the Anatomical Reader, I have only to say that in the selection of the chapters and paragraphs from the ' Physiological Anatomy' I have faithfully followed the Author's directions, and that the whole volume passed under his revision in proof.

48 MR. BOWMAN ON STRUCTURE AND MOVEMENTS OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE raised from its surface. At a, the striae are nine in 10100jbh of an inch; at b, they are twenty, and at c, twenty-six in the same space. At a, the diameter of the fasciculus is -g-^oth of an inch, and at c, 3-o~otn- Fig. 87. Primitive fasciculus of the Skate, partially contracted, showing the contracted part augmented in thickness, with approximated transverse striae, and more evident longitudinal striae. Fig. 88. Shows four stages illustrative of contraction, seen on one occasion in a primitive fasciculus of a Skate. The first state is that of rest; in the second, the striae on one margin are approximated in sets, the" contractions at the same time moving onwards. In the third state, the contractions implicate the whole breadth of the fasciculus, and still advance. In the fourth state, the striae are everywhere approximated, the fasciculus is more opaque and thrown into close rugae. The existence of these rugae is an accidental circumstance, resulting from the contraction of neighbouring fasciculi (not represented in the figure) drawing the ends of this one nearer together than they are brought by its own contraction.

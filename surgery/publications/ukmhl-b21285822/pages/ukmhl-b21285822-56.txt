20 MR. BOWMAN ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE AND regularly aggregated into sets of two or three, some of which showed no interval between their component parts, while others did so. This has been nowhere so well marked as in the Crab (fig. 18).""" Another unusual appearance of the striae is displayed in fig, 20, from the Staghorn Beetle. It seems to have been formerly the universal opinion that the transverse striae are in all muscles separated by equal intervals. Mr. Skey, however, has observed that they vary much in thickness and in number on contiguous fasciculi, and he has once seen them .varying in size on the same fasciculus. Dr. Schwann has also remarked, that they vary in closeness on neighbouring fasciculi. This important circumstance will receive elucidation in the concluding pages of this communication, where the muscular motions will be treated of. At present it is only necessary to detail my observations as to the great variety in the number of the striae seen on fasciculi within a certain space. The muscle of adult animals, which has been examined after all contractility had ceased, will be alone alluded to. Some specimens preserved in spirit will be included, because I have ascertained, by direct experiment, that, when irritability has ceased, immersion in alcohol does not modify the size or proximity of the striae.

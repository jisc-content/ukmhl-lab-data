GENERAL PREFACE. The Bowman Testimonial Fund was inaugurated in July, 1888, at a meeting held at Sir George Johnson's house. Its design was to make to Sir William Bowman some acknowledgment of the appreciation in which he was held on account of his high character and professional and scientific attainments. This, it was suggested, should take the form of a portrait of himself, and also, possibly, a reprint of his publications. His acceptance of this proposal having been asked and received by a deputation consisting of Sir George Johnson, Mr. J. W. Hulke, and Professor Burdon-Sanderson, a Provisional Committee was constituted by whose invitation the subjoined list of the Committee of the Bowman Testimonial Fund, consisting of 446 members, was formed. It was thought more advantageous that the practical carrying out of the scheme should be relegated to a small sub-committee, which was accordingly forthwith appointed. It consists of Mr. Power and Professor Klein, with Sir George Johnson as treasurer, and Messrs. Brailey and Jessop as secretaries. The services of Mr. Ouless, E.A., were secured for the portrait, which was duly exhibited to subscribers in 1889 in the Library of King's College, London, and afterwards at the Eoyal Academy in the summer of the same year. By the generosity of Lady Bowman each subscriber has received an engraving of the portrait, executed by Mr. J. Cother Webb.

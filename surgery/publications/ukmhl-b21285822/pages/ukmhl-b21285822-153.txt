105 THE UNSTRIPED FIBRES. fibres ol the intestine, for example, it is uncertain whether each fibre surrounds the canal once, returning into itself as a ring, or more than once, as a spiral; or whether it passes only partially round it, the circle being completed by others. Whether the areolar tissue (the representative of the fibrous), that is found in connection with these fibres, serves to give them an attachment, by union with their extremities, or by involving them in its meshes, is also altogether unknown. In the gizzard of the bird, the ends of the fibres are united to white fibrous tissue, thus making an approximation to the striped fibre, as they do in colour. But we have not been able, after diligent search, to detect the true transverse stripes, which Ficinus describes to exist in this organ.

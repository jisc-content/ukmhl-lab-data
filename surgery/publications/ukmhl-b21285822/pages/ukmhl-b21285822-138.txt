90 ON THE PROCESS OF OSSIFICATION. the cells. The nuclei likewise often enlarge and become more transparent; a con ditio first pointed out to us by Mr. Tomes, but not present in fig. 31, which was taken from a preparation that had been immersed in spirit. The changes now enumerated may be conveniently considered to constitute the first stage of the process, which extends onty to the ossification of the intercellular substance. In this stage there are no blood- vessels directly concerned. The areola? or minute cancelli, when first formed, contain only the rows of cells which they have enclosed. It is remarkable, that, when the cartilage is torn from * .... &> ■ &M m* MM Vertical section of cai'tilage near the surface of ossification :—a, Ordinary appearance of the temporary cartilage ; a', portion of the same more highly magnified, b, The cells beginning to assume the linear direction ; V, portion more magnified. Opposite c, the ossification is extending in the inter- cellular spaces, and the rows of cells are seen resting in the cavities so formed, the nuclei being more separated than above; c, portion of the same more highly magni- fied.—From a new-born rabbit which had been preserved in spirit.

If the specimen be examined deeper in the bone, even at a depth of -^-th or |th of an inch, other appearances are met with. The lamella? of bone enclosing the cancelli are no longer simply homogeneous or finely granular in texture, but have acquired more the aspect of perfect bone. They are also thicker, and include in their substance elongated oval spaces, which, excepting that they are of a roughly granular nature, exactly resemble the lacunas of bone already described. They are evidently the nuclei of the cells of the temporary cartilage. They are scattered at pretty uniform distances apart, and they all follow the

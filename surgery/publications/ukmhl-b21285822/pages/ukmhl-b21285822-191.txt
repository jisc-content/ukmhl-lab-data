NERVES OF THE PAPILLAE. 143 enables us to distinguish them in such situations from other textures. Thin vertical sections of perfectly fresh specimens are essential for this investigation, and the observer should try upon them the several effects of acetic acid and solution of potass. In thus describing the nerves of the papillse from our own observations we do not deny the existence of true loop-like terminations as figured by so respectable an authority as Gerber,* but neither do we feel entitled to assent to it. We have in numerous instances failed to detect any nerves at all within the papilke, when such were plainly visible at their base, and when, consequently, the chemical agent pig. 83. employed could scarcely have destroyed their characteristic structure, had they been present. We incline to the belief that the tubules either entirely or in a great measure lose the white substance when within the papilke. We would, however, refer the reader to what will be found respecting the nerves of the papilla? of the tongue in the chapter on taste. The essential tissue of the papillse probably exists even where no projections large enough to be called papilla? are present. These portions of the skin are more scantily supplied with nerves; and it is probable from this circumstance, as well as from * ' General Anatomy,' translated by Gulliver.

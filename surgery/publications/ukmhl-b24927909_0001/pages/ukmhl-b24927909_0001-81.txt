AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 65 The connection of local disease with ge- neral disorder has beeen often remarked ; it has been formerly attributed to impurity of the fluids ; a theory which is not irrational. Imperfect digestion must influence the qualities of the blood, and all parts of the body may be affected from this source. But in accounting for the reciprocal influ- on this dogma; the brain being insensible, there can be no such thing as nervous irritation. Believing similar opinions to be prevalent in the profession, I think it worth enquiring, whether, if the motion of a worm in the stomach produces temporary blindness or convul- sions, there be not some nervous irritation ? If a man has his leg amputated on account of a compound frac- ture, and afterwards becomes delirious and dies, I grant that fulness of the vessels of the head will be found on dissection; but was not the vascular action caused by preceding nervous irritation ? The same fulness of vessels and signs of inflammation are found in those who die of fevers ; but do not the miasmata which cause them affect the brain, and suddenly impair and disturb its energy, and is not then the vascular action a con- sequence ? I would ask, too, practically, does blood- letting cure disorders in which there is a fulness of the vessels of the head ? It must be granted, that in many instances it temporarily alleviates them, but in others it fails to relieve and even aggravates them. VOL. i. F

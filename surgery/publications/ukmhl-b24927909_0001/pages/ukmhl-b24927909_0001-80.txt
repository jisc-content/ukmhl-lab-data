Whether this disorder of the digestive organs be primary or secondary, it gene- rally produces irritation in the brain ; and thus may cause in many instances actual disease of that organ, as will be stated in the conclusion of this paper. But derange- ment of the digestive organs arises, in many cases, from established nervous disorder: indeed, there is often reason to suppose that it is dependent on, or connected with, actual disease of the brain. In such cases, the cor- rection of the disordered functions of the di- gestive organs cannot be accomplished ; and even if it were practicable, it would not cure the nervous disease. It is however highly necessary and advantageous to attend to the disorder of the digestive organs, where it is only a symptom of nervous disease. The relief of the former will often mitigate, though it cannot cure, the latter.* * The ingenious Mr. John Bell has of late published an opinion that all nervous disorders depend on the cir- culation of blood in the brain. The opinion is founded

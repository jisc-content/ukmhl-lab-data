AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 139 the chylopoietic viscera must suffer from the impaired and disordered energy of the brain, we might naturally expect such a derange- ment of the functions of the digestive organs to ensue. When such disorder happens in this manner, it frequently produces many local diseases, to which the constitution may perhaps be predisposed; a circumstance I shall speak of in a future part of this paper. In the present case it brought on a painful state of parts recently injured, with a con- siderable degree of fever. That the morbid state of the stomach and bowels was the cause of both, is fairly to be inferred from their ceasing so immediately, when the dis- order of the digestive organs was corrected. A case of this kind, presenting an example of sudden recovery, is particularly valuable, because it clearly demonstrates the cause and the effect in such diseases. The cause can indeed be seldom so suddenly removed; and the gradual cessation of it under any plan of treatment, leaves room for a variety of conjectures as to the mode of cure or of recovery from those disorders which I have considered as effects. I could relate many

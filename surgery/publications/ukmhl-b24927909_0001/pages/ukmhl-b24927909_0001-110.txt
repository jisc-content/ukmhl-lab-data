Where this dose produced uneasy sensations, or acted as an aperient, five grains of the pilul. hydrarg. were substituted in its place; and even this quantity has been diminished in some cases. When the bowels are very irritable, the hydrarg. c creta has been given.* When it appeared necessary, on account of the biliary secretion, and when the calomel did not irritate the bowels, I have increased the dose. The relief, which arises from the increase or correction of the biliary secre- tion, in a great number of these cases, shows how much the liver is concerned in causing or aggravating the symptoms in these diseases.

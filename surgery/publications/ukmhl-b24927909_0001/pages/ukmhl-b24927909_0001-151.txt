AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 135 upon the head, so as to occasion an irrit- able state of the injured parts, and impede their recovery. In many cases of blows upon the head, a slow inflammatory affection continues in the parts chiefly injured, and ultimately produces destructive diseases. The bone sometimes becomes diseased, or an exos- tosis grows from its internal table, the dura mater becomes thickened, or matter slowly collects on its surface. Such local dis- orders produce others of a more general nature, and destroy the patient. These oc- currences are, however, in my opinion, rare in comparison with the cases first described ; in which a painful state of the injured parts is kept up by means of disorder existing in the digestive organs. The necessity for an accurate discrimination between these dis- orders, must strike us on the most super- ficial view of the subject; for the lowering treatment which is necessary in the first and rarer case, would be detrimental in the second and more frequent one.

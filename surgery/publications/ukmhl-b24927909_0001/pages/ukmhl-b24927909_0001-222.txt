2013 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, subject can be placed in a proper point of view. An attention to the state of the bowels is indispensably necessary, even in the common practice of surgery. A simple cut of the finger frets into a bad phagedaenic sore, which resists every local remedy so long, that amputation is at last proposed. This ulcer is the consequence of bad health, which in its turn is aggravated by the irritation of the sore. The patient has a furred tongue, with other symptoms of disordered digestive organs. An attention to this disorder corrects the painful state of the sore, which now heals rapidly under simple dressings. A patient has a disorder in the urethra, almost too trivial for surgical attention ; yet producing much inconvenience. The func- tions of the digestive organs are impaired, and he is hypochondriacal. He consults a physician, under whose care his general health is amended, and he no longer feels or thinks of the local disease.

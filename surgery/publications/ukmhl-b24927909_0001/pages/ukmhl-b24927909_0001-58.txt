ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, 42 far digestion has been effected; and gela- tinous, mucose, and other matters being mixed with them, denote irritation or dis- ease of the bowels. The effects, which medicine or diet may have upon the colour of the faeces, ought, however, to be considered. When the food is coloured, and this colour is not altered by digestion, it will, of course, appear in the faeces; hence if it should be thought desirable to know accurately the state of the biliary secretion, it would be right to restrict patients to a diet that is not likely to colour the faeces. The green colour of vegetables tinses the faecal residue of the food. Steel also is known to blacken the feces. It should, too, be remarked, that the exposure of the feces to air after their expulsion, will, in some instances, cause a considerable al- teration in their colour. In our endeavours, therefore, to ascertain whether the liver is performing its office rightly, by observing the colour of the feces, attention should be paid to these circumstances.

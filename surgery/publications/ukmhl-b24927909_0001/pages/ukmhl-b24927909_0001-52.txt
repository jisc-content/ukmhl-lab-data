36 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, It seems probable that the stools which resemble pitch are principally composed of diseased secretions from the internal sur- face of the intestines, since they do not seem either like the residue of the food or discharges from the liver. Can we suppose that all the black and fetid matter whiph was discharged from the bowels, in the first case that I have related, was poured forth solely from the liver ? The subject of morbid secretions is, how- ever, particularly illustrated by that well- occurred to Mr. Hallam, an intelligent and experienced practitioner residing in Walworth Road. He delivered a patient of a fine, muscular, fat, and healthy child, but which had an impervious oesophagus, so that no food ever passed into its stomach. The child lived for thirteen days, and was so wasted that its skin hung like a loose garment, and could be folded and lapped over its limbs. At first the child discharged the usual quantity of me- conium from the bowels, and afterwards had, during eight days, one or two alvine evacuations, in quantity, colour, and consistence, not distinguishable from the stools of children who take food in the usual manner. After the eighth day the discharges per anum became more scanty and less frequent, but they continued to the last.

ON ANEURISMS. 303 as it increases the stock of facts before the public ; I have known such a spontaneous cure take place twice in the popliteal artery, once in the arteria profunda femoris, and once in the axillary artery. For these reasons it was agreed to postpone the oper- ation in the case of the present patient till circumstances should appear to demand its performance.* * There was about twelve months ago a soldier in the York Hospital, who had an aneurism of the femoral artery; but the external tumour had so much overlapped Poupartâ€™s ligament, and interposed itself between the in- teguments and the fascia of the external oblique muscle, as to render an operation very difficult, if not impossible. In this case the integuments mortifying, occasioned a simultaneous coagulation of the blood in the artery, for though the coagula came out, yet there was no fresh haemorrhage, and the patient recovered. Since .the preceding edition of this book, I have seen two other cases of the spontaneous cure of aneurisms ; one was in the external iliac artery, and the aneurismal sac formed a large tumour within the abdomen, extend- as high as the umbilicus, and across the belly as far as the linea alba. In the other case I conjecture that the aneurism was in the common trunk, which gives rise to the right cephalic and subclavian portion of the brachial artery. The pressure of the aneurismal sac had caused the absorption of the ribs beneath the clavicle, so that the r

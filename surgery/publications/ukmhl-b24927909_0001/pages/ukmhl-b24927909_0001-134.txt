118 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, above, and as the bowels were disordered, I ordered two grains of calomel with eight of rhubarb to be taken twice a week, and some infusion of gentian with senna occa- sionally. After using these medicines for about three weeks, his bowels became re- gular, the biliary secretion healthy, and his appetite good. He could move his hands and arms nearly as well as ever; and his eye-sight was so much improved that he could read a newspaper ; indeed, it was nearly well. The functions of the bladder were completely restored *; his speech became articulate; and his general health, in every respect, much improved. He remained in the hospital about two months, but with very little amendment in the state of the lower extremities, when his friends suddenly removed him, on account of some disagreement with the nurses, and I was unable to learn whither they had conveyed him. * I have seen several cases which induce me to believe that the weakness or irritation ol the bladder, which occasions young persons to void their urine during sleep, very frequently arises from the same cause.

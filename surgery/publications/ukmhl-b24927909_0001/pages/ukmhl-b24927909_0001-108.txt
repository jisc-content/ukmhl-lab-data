This plan of practice is what Dr. Hamilton has suggested, and the utility of which he has so successfully elucidated. I am aware that laxative medicines may relieve irritation merely by augmenting the natural secretions of the viscera, and thus unloading their vessels ; and also by deter- mining the fluids from the head, when the nervous symptoms are aggravated by a ple- nitude of the vessels of the brain.

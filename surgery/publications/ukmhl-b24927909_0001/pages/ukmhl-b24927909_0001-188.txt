172 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, CASE XIV. A gentleman, thirty-two years of age, who had been subject for several years to occasional attacks of severe pain in the bowels, was seized, about the end of Au- gust, with a violent purging, which con- tinued for a fortnight, and was attended with fever. About a month afterwards, he felt pain in his leg at night, which gra- dually became continued even during the day, and obliged him to confine himself to bed. In the beginning of October, a swell- ing was perceived near the inner ankle, which suppurated, and was opened on the twentieth of the same month. Two large tea-cupsful of dark brown matter were evacuated. The discharge continued pro- fuse for some time, and afterwards dimi- nished. Four other small gatherings then took place in succession, and, bursting, con- allowable to conclude that diseases of muscles, produc- tive of alterations in their natural structure, originate from this cause.

228 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, CASES. SECTION VII. Disorders of Parts which have a Continuity of Surface with the alimentary Canal. I had formerly observed spasmodic stric- tures of the oesophagus to disappear under various modes of treatment, in a manner which I did not understand. Mercury seemed to effect the cure in three instances. Many cases have occurred to me lately, in which the irritation in the oesophagus seemed to be first excited and afterwards maintained by disorder of the digestive organs. It will be readily allowed, that spasmodic strictures of the oesophagus, when long continued, may cause a thickening in the affected part of the tube, and thus the stricture may become permanent. One instance will be sufficient to illustrate and verity this view of the subject.

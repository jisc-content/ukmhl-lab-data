ON ANEURISMS. ately subsequent to the operation appear to me to have arisen entirely from the irritable and weak state of the patient. She had pain in the head from the operation ; and so she had afterwards, whenever her health was disordered by irritation. Her pulse, prior to her taking the medicine which acted as an emetic, was 96; but the sub- sequent day it was 150 or 160. This appears to be the result of the state of the stomach; for that becoming tranquil, the pulse was again reduced to 9<5 or 96. In a constitution so weak and irritable, a wound was not likely to heal kindly; and all the subsequent circumstances of the case are satisfactorily explained, as the effects of an irritable wound, acting upon an irritable constitution. Upon the wound becoming healthy, at the expiration of a fortnight, all variations of the constitution ceased. I cannot, therefore, but consider the per- plexing circumstances that succeeded the operation as the effect of the patientâ€™s pecu- liarity of constitution, and not as arising from the operation itself, or from the state of the limb consequent to such an operation.

78 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, Secondly, As to quality: It is not my intention to discuss the question as to the nature of the food proper for mankind. When the stomach is weak, it seems parti- cularly necessary that it should be nutritive and easy of digestion.* I may further ob- serve, that its qualities should be adapted to the feelings of the stomach. In proof of this proposition, numerous instances might be mentioned of apparently unfit substances agreeing with the stomach, being digested and even quieting an irritable state of stomach, merely because they were suitable to its feelings. Instances might also be mentioned of changes in diet producing a tranquil and healthy state of stomach in cases where medicines had been tried in vain. Neither can such occurrences excite surprise; for as digestion and the conse- quent tranquillity of the stomach depends on a proper quantity of healthy juices be- ins secreted and commixed with the food, * Bread is the most nourishing of vegetable sub- stances ; milk, egg, jdlyj and meat, of animal substances ; and the meals may be composed ot equal parts of bread and of these kinds of animal matter.

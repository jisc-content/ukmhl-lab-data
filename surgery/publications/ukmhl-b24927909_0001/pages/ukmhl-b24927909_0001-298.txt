ON ANEURISMS. 28 2 jerk communicated to the artery to a con- siderable distance. Also, when an artery is tied with a thick ligature, the compres- sion made by it is not so great as to produce a speedy mortification and separation of the end of the vessel, so that the ligature remains, in general, a fortnight before it is detached, and therefore time is allowed for the consolidation of the sides of the vessel prior to its separation. * When an artery is thus tied, in cases of aneurism, it pos- sesses its natural surrounding connections and support, and is left loose, in conse- quence of its division. It appears, indeed, in most respects similarly circumstanced to an artery tied upon the surface of a stump ; * Dr. Jones, whose numerous and accurate experi- ments have thrown much light upon the natural means by which hasmorrhages are suppressed, thinks that the ligatures should be round and firm; because such cords are most likely to cut the internal coats of the artery. I am solicitous that they should be strong and moderately large; because, as far as I have remarked, large ligatures remain longest on the arteries before they are detached; and in examining the stumps of patients who have died after amputation, 1 have frequently seen the sides of the artery unclosed, even though the ligatures have fallen offâ€™from them.

304 ON ANEURISMS. Our poor patient therefore lay in the hos- pital during two months, in which time his tumour presented itself so exactly in the situation of the axillary artery, that I believe most surgeons would at first sight have supposed the tumour, which was as large as a large fist, and beat vehemently, to have been an aneurism of that artery; yet when the subclavian artery was pressed above the clavicle, the pulse at the wrist was stopped, without lessening the pulsations of the aneurism. The patient had come to London, supposing that some operation might be undertaken for his relief. His di- gestive organs were disordered, and his heart throbbed violently against his side. 1 recommended him to live on as spare a diet as he possibly could ; observing to him, that by keeping his vessels in a state free from plenitude, he was most likely to lessen that forcible action of the heart, which caused the increase of his disease, whilst at the same time the same measures would tend to insure the complete digestion of every portion of aliment he received into his stomach, and thereby improve the state of his digestive organs. I urged him also to regulate the functions of the other viscera concerned in digestion. I heard that about six months afterwards he was very well, and lately upon enquiry was informed that he was as well as at any period of his life. About three years afterwards I heard that a relapse had taken place, and that the patient died. I have known other cases greatly benefited and apparently cured by spare diet alone, with attention to regulate the functions of the digestive organs. Yet in some instances, also, occasional bleeding seemed both requisite and beneficial.

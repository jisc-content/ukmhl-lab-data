AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 23 gestive organs ; in order to induce surgeons to pay that strict attention to them, which the importance of the subject so well de- serves. It would indeed be impossible for the reader to understand, without such pre- fatory observations, my object in the treat- ment of the cases which will presently be related, or the opinions which I have formed relative to their mode of cure. The changes which the food undergoes in the digestive organs of the more compli- cated animals are threefold; and distinct organs are allotted to each of the three pro- cesses. Digestion takes place in the sto- mach ; chylification in the small intestines ; and a third process, hitherto undenomi- nated, is performed in the large intestines. It is probable that, in some cases, one set of organs may be more disordered than the others, and ol course one of these processes may fail more than the rest. For instance, the stomach may digest the food in a heal- thy manner, although the intestines do not perform their share of the changes, which they ought to effect. c 4

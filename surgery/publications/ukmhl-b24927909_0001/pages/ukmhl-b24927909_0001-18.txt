ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, 2 more particularly some parts of these sub- jects, and to submit them to public notice, are the proposed objects of the present paper. No part of the animal body can in general be very considerably disordered, without oc- casioning a correspondent derangement in other parts of the system. Such disorder has been considered by Mr. Hunter as the result of universal sympathy. This con- sent of the whole constitution with its parts manifests itself, in particular instances, by a greater disturbance of the functions of some organs than of those of others; and from this circumstance diseases have derived the appellations by which they are commonly distinguished. If the actions of the sangui- ferous system be principally disturbed, and the temperature of the body subject to un- usual variations, the disease is termed fever. If the nervous system be chiefly affected, a state of vigilance or of delirium may be produced : and when the functions of the muscular system are more particularly dis- ordered, convulsions and tetanus take place.

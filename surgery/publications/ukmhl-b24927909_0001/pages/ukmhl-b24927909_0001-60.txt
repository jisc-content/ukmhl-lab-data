44 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, would rather apply that term to the change in the residue of the food, which takes place in the large intestines, and which seems to be affected by the vital powers of those organs. The faeces quickly suffer chemical decomposition out of the body, although they often remain in the bowels without undergoing the same kind of change. Their chemical decomposition is attended with the sudden formation of am- monia; yet if they be examined when re- cent, they are found to contain acids, which ammonia would neutralize. The inference, therefore, naturally arises, that this third process, I mean the conversion of the resi- due of the aliment into faeces, may, amongst other purposes, be designed so to modify that residue, as to prevent it from under- cmino' those various chemical changes which & o o may be stimulating to the containing organs, as well as injurious to the general health. In a perfectly healthy state of the digestive organs, probably no chemical decomposi- tion, even of the faeces, takes place: yet such changes happen, in some degree, with-

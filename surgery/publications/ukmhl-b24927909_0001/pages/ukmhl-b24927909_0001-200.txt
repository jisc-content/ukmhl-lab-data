184< ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, I need not detail any cases on this occasion, since every surgeon must know them fami- liarly. The patients are commonly sent to the sea-side, or into the country; where enlarged glands subside, and those which have suppurated and ulcerated heal; and the local disease recovers in proportion as the health in general is amended. There are cases of scrofulous diseases occurring suddenly, and in various parts of the body at the same time, which seem to originate in that state of the constitution which is occasioned by disorder of the diges- tive organs. 1 have chiefly observed these cases in children ; and they have followed some violent febrile affection. In two cases which I shall particularly mention, the small-pox was the antecedent disease. I have already stated, that when the health has been considerably disordered by some violent disease, the digestive organs may become subsequently affected ; and that this disorder proves a cause of many se- condary diseases.

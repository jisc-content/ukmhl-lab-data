AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 228 A case like that described in the preced- ing sketch would, I believe, be acknow- ledged by every one to be dependent on the state of the constitution in general; but I could bring forward a great number ot instances of chronic affections of joints, incurable by local measures, which were evidently cured by correcting those errors in the state of the digestive organs, which were the cause or effect of general disorder of constitution. In diseases of joints, we find three distinct kinds of cases : first, a scro- fulous disease of the bones, which ultimately affects their articular surfaces ; secondly, an inflammatory affection of the joint, pro- ducing effusion of fluids into its cavity, and ulceration of the cartilages and ligaments ; and in this case, the most perfect rest, and most strenuous efforts by local means to put a stop to inflammation are requisite ; and, thirdly, an inflammation dependent on con- stitutional causes. This inflammation is much disordered. I could relate several instances of the wounds made in operations assuming diseased actions from such a state of the constitution.

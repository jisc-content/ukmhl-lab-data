Q4< ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, The food is converted in the stomach into a viscid semitransparent substance called chyme: arid that this change is ef- fected by the agency of the succus gastri- cus, is a point as well ascertained as any in physiology. * In a state of health, this con- version takes place without any appearance of that natural decomposition which animal and vegetable matter would ordinarily un- dergo in a warm and moist place. When, however, digestion is imperfect, gaseous fluids are extricated from the alimentary matter. Vegetable food becomes acid, and oils become rancid. Uneasy sensations are also felt, and undigested aliment may be observed in the faeces. Disorder of the stomach is, however, more readily perceived by adverting to the state of the tongue, which often indicates an irritable and unhealthy condition of the stomach, when no manifest symptoms ol in- digestion occur.

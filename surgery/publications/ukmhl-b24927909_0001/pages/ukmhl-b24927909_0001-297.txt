ON ANEURISMS. 281 because the artery would be stretched in its longitudinal direction by so doing; and care should also be taken not to injure the contiguous veins or nerves. When the operator has thus gently insinuated his finger between the vessel and its surround- ing connections, so that an inch of its sur- face is every where exposed, two ligatures may be put under it, one of which is to be carried upwards, and the other downwards, as far as the artery is detached, and then tied as firmly as possible. The artery should then be divided by a probe-pointed bistoury in the interspace between the two ligatures, but nearer to the lower ligature than to the upper one. In my opinion, large arteries should always be tied with moderately thick liga- tures, because we may then draw the noose as tightly as possible, without apprehension of cutting or tearing the coats of the vessel, or of breaking the ligature. The latter occurrence would in many cases prove a very embarrassing circumstance, and it might be very injurious on account of the

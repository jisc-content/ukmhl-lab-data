AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 183 larse and troublesome boils from the least irritation of the skin. I have seen many persons thus affected; and there has been, in every instance, disorder oi the digestive organs, the correction of which has pre- vented the return of these vexatious local diseases. One gentleman, who had been tormented for many years by the quick suc- cessive formation of boils as large as eggs, has been free from them for some .years; though he has had other disorders, which denote such a condition of the constitution as it has been my object to describe in this paper. I have remarked, in many instances, that diseases of the absorbent glands, such as are usually denominated scrofulous, occurring in adults, have apparently originated from the disorder which I have described. In several cases, the local disease was of long duration, and had become worse rather than better under various plans of medical treat- ment ; yet it amended regularly, and some- times even quickly, in proportion as the state of the digestive organs was corrected. n 4

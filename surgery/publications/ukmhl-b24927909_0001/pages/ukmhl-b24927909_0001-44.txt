28 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN* of the chemical changes which it may then undergo. When digestion is imperfect, animal and vegetable substances experience considerable chemical changes before they leave the stomach; and similar changes may continue to take place during the time they are detained in the bowels, unless counteracted by the powers of the digestive organs ; powers which seem chiefly to be- long to the fluids which are secreted into them. The extent of the power which the in- testines possess of converting what they receive from the stomach into chyle, or of preventing chemical changes, is unknown. It is probable that much undigested matter is absorbed by the lacteals, when the diges- tive powers fail in their functions. This is apparently the case in diabetes, where the vegetable matter floats in the serum of the blood, rendering it turbid, and afterwards combines so as to form a substance resem- bling sugar in its passage through the kid- neys. The strong odour, which various kinds of food impart to the urine, indicates

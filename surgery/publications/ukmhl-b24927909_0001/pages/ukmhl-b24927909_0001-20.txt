4 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, produced by irritation imparted to the brain, which, by a kind of reflected operation, oc- casions a greater disorder of some of the organs of the body than of others, and thus gives a character and denomination to the disease.* * Mr. Hunter, who, with that patience and industry for which he was so remarkable, collected and examined all the facts which he had observed relative to the sub- ject of sympathy, has divided it into continuous, conti- guous, and remote. It is the remote sympathies, ac- cording to his division, of which I am now speaking. The observations of Dr. Darwin on ocular spectra, and indeed the consideration of the nervous functions in general, render it highly probable that sensation is not produced merely by impulses made on the nerves, but by means of actions excited by such impulses, which actions are continued to the sensorium. Nervous actions, then, may take place without the usually exciting causes : such actions may be continued through the medium of the reticular communications of nerves, and thus physiolo- gically we may explain the continuous and contiguous sympathies. Actions also productive of sympathetic sens- ations may be supposed to take place through the media of ganglia or plexuses. In remote sympathies, however, we must suppose the actions which originate in an in- jured or diseased part of the body to be continued to the sensorium, and there to excite the actions of other nerves, &c. For a more full account of Mr. Hunterâ€™s opinions on these subjects, see the third lecture delivered in the Royal College of Surgeons in London.

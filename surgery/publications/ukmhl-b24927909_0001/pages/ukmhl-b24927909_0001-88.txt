72 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, . nervous disorder or imperfect chylideation.* Or if local diseases occur in a constitution . deranged in the manner which I have de- scribed, they will become peculiar in their nature and progress, and difficult of cure. Affections of all those parts which have a continuity of surface with the stomach, as the throat, mouth, lips, skin, eyes, nose, and ears, may be caused or aggravated by this complaint. I must observe, before I proceed to the relation of cases, that such a disorder of the digestive organs as I have described existed in every instance. I do not take upon myself to say, that it was the primary cause of the general derangement of the constitution with which the local dis- ease appeared to be connected; it might have been the consequence, as, indeed, * The liability of parts to become diseased in conse- quence of general disorder, will probably be in propor- tion to their weakness, susceptibility, or complication of structure and function. We know that bones, ligaments, and glands, are very liable to be thus affected; and in the Third Lecture at the College, I have endeavoured to show how dissimilar, or much diversified, diseases may result from the same general causes.

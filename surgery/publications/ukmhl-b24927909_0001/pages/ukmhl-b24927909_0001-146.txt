The occurrence of this disorder occa- sionally, when the wound which produced it is healing, seems to indicate that the effects which have been produced by its irritation continue. It has been, I think, fully shown that local irritation may disor- der the digestive organs; which disorder continuing and aggravating the affection of the sensorium, may possibly lead to the production of tetanus, at a time when the wound is no longer irritable. In four cases of tetanus, in which I had an opportunity of enquiring into the state of the bowels, the evacuations from them were not like faeces.

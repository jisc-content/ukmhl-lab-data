I knew that these patients had their digestive organs disordered in the manner that I have de- scribed, and that in many of them the secretion of bile had been suppressed for a great length of time, and when it was re- newed, that it was very deficient in quantity, and faulty in quality : yet, on dissection, no alteration was discovered in the structure of the chylopoietic viscera which could be decidedly pronounced to be the effect of disease.

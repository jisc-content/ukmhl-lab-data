PREFACE. \ The best mode of obtaining and extend- ing medical and surgical knowledge is, in my opinion, to pay that strict attention to diseases, which qualifies us to note even the slighter shades of difference that distinguish them from each other. Such discrimination leads us to form some regular arrangement of them, which, even if it be not correct, may ultimately enable us to discover their natural series and order. This method I have pursued from the beginning of my professional studies. Whenever the opi- nions on subjects of importance, which an attention to cases had impressed upon my mind, differed from those which seemed to prevail amongst other practitioners, I pub- lished the facts, and the inferences which I drew from them, because I thought that the former, at least, deserved attention, and that the latter would either be confirmed or con- futed by the result of general experience.

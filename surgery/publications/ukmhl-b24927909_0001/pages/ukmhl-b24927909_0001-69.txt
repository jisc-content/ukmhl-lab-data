AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 53 e 3 have varied in severity in proportion to the violence of the blow received. In the cases which were the consequence of the more forcible injuries, the symptoms were, a furred tongue; great vomiting, so that the stomach could retain no food; difficulty of affecting the bowels by medicine; great fever; and even delirium. Indeed, all those effects were produced, which I have represented as arising from vehement local irritation of remote parts of the body. The disorder has generally terminated by a pro- fuse discharge of black and fetid stools, after which the patient has perfectly reco- vered. On the contrary, where the symp- toms consequent on the blow have been less violent, so as not to claim such strict attention, the disorder has continued. Per- sons who had been previously in perfect health have become hypochondriacal, and have had all those symptoms of disorder of the digestive organs, which have been already enumerated as arising from a less degree of local irritation, with such conse- quent diseases as originate from such dis-

02 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, disorders of the head and of the digestive o organs on each other: yet the exceptions to this general rule deserve to be remarked in a comprehensive examination of the sub- ject. Some persons have great disorder of the digestive organs, without any apparent affection of the nervous system ; and even diseases of a fatal nature may take place in the former organs, without affecting the latter. Indeed, if we examine any of the most evidently sympathetic affections, we shall find the same exceptions. The sto- mach generally sympathises with disorder of the uterus, but it does not invariably do so. Many of the symptoms recorded in the description of the state of health of those persons who are affected by disorders in the digestive organs, denote a disturbance ol the nervous and muscular powers. When we observe this compound disorder, we can feelings of the bowels affect the nervous system, and how immediately and completely the general disorder is re- lieved by an alvine evacuation.

AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 121 After the patient had continued in the hospital about seven weeks, she was at- tacked with fever, and died. To this brief account of the symptoms, I now subjoin the dissection. No diseased appearances were observed in the brain, though it was examined with the most particular attention : neither was there any disease of the vertebrae. No dis- ease, in short, was observed, except in the abdominal viscera. The chief morbid ap- pearance, in them, consisted in an ulcerated state of the villous coat of the ilium near to its termination in the caecum. The ulcers were numerous, and situated where the mucous glands are chiefly found. The in- ternal coat of the large intestines, also, ap- peared inflamed. The liver was healthy in its structure. In the gall-bladder about one ounce and a half of a light green serous fluid was found, which had not in the least degree the soapy or mucilaginous feel of bile.

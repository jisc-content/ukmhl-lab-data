AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 257 concerned in digestion, my primary object was, to endeavour to ascertain, by dissec- tion, how far pulmonary diseases originated from such a source. I have, in the course of my enquiries, had several opportunities of examining the bodies ol patients who apparently died of phthisis, combined with diseases of the digestive organs. In these cases both the history and dissection tended to prove, that the chylopoietic viscera were the seat of the greatest and most esta- blished disease, and that the pulmonary affection was a secondary disorder.

But dissections can never conclu- sively ascertain the truth of the opinions which I have stated; for the same disposi- tion to disease existing in the constitution may equally affect both the pulmonary and digestive organs. Nay, observations made in dissection in general would tend to dis- prove the opinions alluded to ; for diseases of the lungs are very commonly met with in dead bodies, while those of the liver and VOL.

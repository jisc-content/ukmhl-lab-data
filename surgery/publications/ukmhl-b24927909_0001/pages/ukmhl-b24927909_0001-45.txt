It may be reasonably conjectured that the same powers, by which the kidneys convert the old materials of our body into that pecu- liar modification of animal matter, which is dissolved in the water of the urine, and which has been called by the French che- mists uree, may also enable it, in a healthy and vigorous state, to dispose of much un- assimilated substance in the same way. The further consideration of the subject would, however, lead to a discussion foreign to the purpose of the present paper : it will be sufficient to remark at present, that the state of the urine may afford assistance in ascertaining the existence of disorder of the digestive organs, and in indicating its

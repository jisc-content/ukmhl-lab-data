ON ANEURISMS. 278 The occurrence of haemorrhage led some surgeons to adopt a practice which cannot but be considered as injurious. They ap- plied a second ligature above the other, leaving it loose, but ready to be drawn tight if the first should not answer. The second ligature, however, must not only keep a certain portion of the artery de- tached from the surrounding parts, but must also give additional irritation to the inflamed vessel; and on both these accounts it is more likely to make the inflammation end in suppuration or ulceration. The mode of performing the operation for the aneurism, which Mr. Hunterâ€™s judgment and experience taught him to adopt, was to expose and disturb the artery as little as possible, and, after having tied it, to bring the surrounding parts into con- tact with it again. Though an experienced and skilful operator may accomplish this object with very little disturbance of the artery from its natural situation and con- nections, yet I cannot but suspect that sur- geons in general may not be so successful,

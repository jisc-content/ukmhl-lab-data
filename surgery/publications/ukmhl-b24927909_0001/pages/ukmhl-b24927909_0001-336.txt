320 ON ANEURISMS* from the lower end of the artery. This latter opinion is very improbable, since, after the complete removal of the blood, none returned by that channel; and in the first case which I have related, none re- turned by the inferior part of the artery, though the area of it was still of its natural dimensions, and unobstructed. This latter observation had tended to diminish my confidence in the powers of the communi- cating channels, and made me wish to defer O 9 the performance of the operation as long as possible. It seems evident, that in the present instance it was too long de- layed. It would be desirable in future to per- form the operation before an extensive dif- fusion of blood had taken place; indeed, could the adequateness of the collateral arteries for the supply of the limb be esta- blished, it would be proper to operate at an early period of the disease. It deserves to be considered whether, in cases where it is probable the blood is l

436 ARREST OF ARTERIAL HjEMORRHAGE. The changes that take place outside the artery are of equal, if not of greater, importance than those going on within. They require, however, no special description, for they are merely the ordinary processes of repair, such as take place in the union of a wound. As an immediate consequence of the ni- jury necessitating the appUcation of the ligature, or inflicted in applying it, an abundant coagulable exudation takes place, and before twenty-four hours have passed the space between the external coat and the sheath for some distance on each side of the ligature is filled by firm " coagulable lymph," composed of migrated white corpuscles entangled in the meshes of coagulated fibrin. The ligature itself, the injured part of the artery and, in the case of a divided vessel, the part beyond the ligature, are speedily embedded in the same material. The subsequent processes depend entirely on the nature of the material of which the ligature is composed, and the success attending the Surgeon's efforts to obtain primary union of the wound. If the ligature itself is unirritating and the conditions necessary for primary union of the wound (see p. 28(0 present, vascularisation of the exudation commences on the second day, and the injured part of the vessel is, before many days have passed, surrounded by firm granulation-tissue developing into the fibrous tissue of the scar. The ligature, as we shall see hereafter, if absorbable, becomes penetrated by leucocytes and disappears, this process being un- accompanied by acute inflammation or suppuration ; and the experiments of Tillmanns and others have shown that the same process takes place in the portion of a divided artery beyond the hgature. The similar changes which are taking place in the nodule of exudation-matter within the vessel can, under these circumstances, proceed without any disturbance from without. Thus it is that statistics show that the modern improvements in the treatment of

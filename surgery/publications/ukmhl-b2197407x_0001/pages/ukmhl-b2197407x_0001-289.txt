DIAGNOSIS OF ABSCESS. 257 On so doing, if fluid be present a wave will be felt to pass from under the hand which is pressing more strongly, raising that which is applied less firmly. In feeling for fluctuation the Surgeon should always place as large a surface of each hand as possible over the supposed fluid. The fingers should be curved so as to adapt themselves evenly to the part, and the pressure should be gentle and steady. If merely the tips of two fingers be poked into an inflamed part it gives pain to the patient, causing him involuntarily to wince and contract the muscles in the neighbourhood, thus obscuring all definite sensations of fluctuation. In large collections of fluid, as in ascites, one hand may be placed on one side and the opposite side struck a smart blow with the tip of one finger of the other hand, when a sharp impulse will be felt distinctly communicated through the fluid. This method of feeling fluctuation is, however, scarcely ever practicable in the case of an abscess. Fluctuation may readily be confounded with the undulatory sensation communicated by some tissues from mere inflammatory inflltration into them. This, indeed, is a difference of degree rather than of kind ; as pus would make its appearance in the course of a few hours, if the tumour were left to Itself. Even without this, certain parts give very deceptive sensations from their natural laxity, as is sometimes the case in the areolar tissue of the nates and thigh. A still more perfect sense of fluctuation is given by a muscle when the hands are applied transversely to its fibres ; and, consequently, in all cases it is a rule to feel for fluctuation with the hands applied first along and afterwards across the line of any muscle that may be situated beneath or over the suspected collection of fluid. Many soft solid growths give a sense of fluctuation almost as distinctly as fluid, deceiving even the most experienced. In the case of an encapsuled tumour the distinction can readily be made by pressing on its edge with the tip of one finger. If it is a chronic abscess or cyst, unless it be very tense, the finger goes throuR-h the swellmg without anything being felt to move ; in the case of a tumour the solid edge IS felt to roll away. In some rare cases, even when fluid is present, fluctuation may be wanting, as the tension may be too great to allow of a wave being produced in the contents of the cavity. The occurrence of fluctuation alone, however, is not of itself sufficient to determine more than that a fluid exists in the part. The question necessarily arises, is this fluid pus ^ In the majority of abscesses, the history of the case, the character of the pam, the elevation of the temperature, the previous existence and the continuance of symptoms of inflammation, enable the Surgeon to answer in the affirmative. But if, as in chronic or cold abscesses, there be only obscure evidence of inflammation having existed, and if the swelling be of long 8 andmg, the fluctuation being perhaps deeply seated and indistinct, the safer plan will be for the Surgeon to introduce an exploring needle, and to see what List Ip! r " ""f ^^^^^^ ^^^^y embarrassing mistakes m diagnosis may be avoided. tho^e',J/^r7 ^""^"'l- f'''' ^^'"^ ^'^^■^ '^''^^ confounded, are ho e /,^ ^.,.,,/^, ,n which there is a high degree of elasticity, giving rise lb el '" T '^\i ^^'^^ be confounded with ituZ ■ ^1 ' ''f symptoms, the temperature, the tbt t f general appearance and feel of the tumour, will usually ^nable the Surgeon to make a diagnosis ; but should any doubt exist, the V OL.

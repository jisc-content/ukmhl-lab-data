89 RESULTS OF AMPUTATION. fatal. In the followincr tables, the cases are divided merely into primary and secoudary. The first is from my own practice at University College Hospital. During the last fifteen years, owing to the great success attending the antiseptic treatment of compound fractures, secondary amputations have been so rare that no statistics of any value can be added. The cases in the second table have been collected from various sources, and refer to civil practice before 1870.

HOG 426 38-5 408 195 47-7 When we consider that the secondary amputations are almost exclusively derived from cases in which an attempt to save the limb has failed on account of extensive sloughing of the soft parts, gaugene of the limb from injury to the vessels, profuse suppuration, septic osteomyelitis, necrosis of the bones, or threatened death from exhaustion or septic poisoning, it is not surprising that they are followed by a higher proportion of deaths than primary operations. In primary amputations high up in the thigh for injury, shock, more due to accident than the operation, is so commonly fatal, that the proportion of deaths is higher for primary than secondary amputations in this region. We must not conclude, however, that the patient's chance of hfe would be increased by leaving the mangled limb on in the hope of his surviving to a secondary amputation. Death from shock would probably occur, as the presence of the limb would prevent rallying and be as fatal as the operation. In any secondary operation, should the patient survive the period of shock, the condition of the limb at the time of amputation necessarily increases the risk of pyaemia, septicemia and secondary hsemorrhage. The deaths from these causes are therefore more common in secondary amputations, while shock is more frequent in primary operations. In military practice, secondary amputation is also more fatal than primary. In the British army in the Crimea, the relative rates of mortality per cent, after primary and secondary amputations, were as follows :— after p-imary

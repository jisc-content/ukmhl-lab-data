677 ELBOW—RADIUS. suddenly brought up against the lower end of the humerus, against which it strikes with a sudden shock (Figs. 257, 259). On rotating the radius great pain is experienced, and the head of the bone can be felt to roll on the fore part of the humerus, the external condyle of which appears to project un- naturally, with a distinct hollow beneath it where the head of the radius should be. The hand and arm can be fully pronated, but cannot be supinated more than half way. The whole of the outer side of the arm is deformed, being carried somewhat forwards (Fig. 258). The rupture of the orbicular hgament Fig. 257.—Dislocation of the Radius forwards : Limit of Power of Bendiug the Ai'in.

The dislocation of the radius Backwards is extremely rare ; it may always be recognized by the head of the bone being felt subcutaneously, behind the external condyle ; the movements of the elbow, and of the radius especially, being at the same time very limited and painful. Dislocation of the radius Outwards is of more frequent occurrence than the last injury, the head of the bone being thrown on the outer side of the external condyle, where it is felt under the skin, rolling as the hand is moved. The natural motions of the joint are of course greatly interfered with. Subluxation of the Head of the Radius.—This name has been given to an mjury not uncommonly produced in children bv the nurse or mother jerking the hand suddenly upwards in an attempt to save the child from falling. The limb is held motionless, with the elbow slightly flexed, and the

VARICOSE ANEURISM. 471 the vein is due to abnormal blood-pressure from the direct entry of arterial blood into it. The Symptoms consist of a tumour at the seat of injury, which can be emptied by pressure upon the artery leading to it, or by compressing its walls. If subcutaneous, this tumour is of a blue or purple colour, of an oblong shape, and will be seen to receive the dilated and tortuous veins. It will be found to pulsate distinctly with a tremulous jarring motion, rather than a distinct impulse. Auscultation detects in it a loud and blowing, whiffing, rasping, or hissing sound, usually of a peculiarly harsh character. This sound has very Fig. lul.—A Varicose Aneurism at the Bend of the Ai-m unopened. aptly been compared by Porter to the noise made by a fly in a paper-bag, and by Listen to the sound of distant and complicated machinery. The thrill and sound are more distinct in the upper than in the lower part of the limb, and are most perceptible if the limb be allowed to hang down so as to become congested. Besides these local symptoms, there is usually some muscular weakness, together with diminution in the temperature of the part supplied by the injured artery. Treatment.—As this condition, when once established, is stationary, all Fig. 15-2.—The same Varicose Aneurism removed from its connections. operative interference should be avoided, an elastic bandage merely being upphed. Should a case occur in which more than this is required, the artery must be cut down upon and ligatured on each side of the wound in it. Holmes suggests that in aneurisraal varix a cure might possibly be obtained by pressure directed solely to the orifice in the vein. Varicose Aneurism.—In this condition the openings in the artery and vein do not directly communicate (see Figs. 152 and 153), but an aneurismal sac is formed between the two vessels, through which the blood passes into the vein. The Pathological Condition consists in the formation of a circumscribed

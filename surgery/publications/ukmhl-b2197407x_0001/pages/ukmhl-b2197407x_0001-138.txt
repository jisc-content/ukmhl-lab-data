SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. io6 divide the musculo-spiral nerve by a firm sweep of the knife round the back of the bone (Fig. 47), if the amputation ba performed in that part of the arm where this nerve winds round the humerus. The operation is also frequently performed by antero-posterior flaps. In this method the anterior flap includes the biceps and brachialis anticus, and the posterior contains the triceps. The brachial artery and the median nerve may be left in either flap as may seem most convenient to the operator, but care must be taken that the artery is not pierced daring transfixion. The choice of the operation depends somewhat upon the condition of the limb ; if it be muscular, the circular or modified circular will give the best results. Amputation at the Shoulder-joint may be performed by the flap or the oval method. If it be required for injury the oval is preferable, but the flap method may also be employed. If it be for a tumour of the upper end of the bone the flap method by dissection will be found the best operation. Fig. 4S.â€”Amputation at the Shoulder-joint by Transfixion. Haemorrhage during the operation must be prevented by the means described at pages 47 and 50. In operating by transfixion, a long narrow-bladed knife should be used. One assistant must have charge of the limb ; another should raise the flap ; and a third must follow the knife as it cuts behind the humerus, and grasp the inner flap with the axillary artery, so as to prevent haemorrhage from this vessel. An assistant holding the arm away from the body so as to relax the deltoid, the knife, instead of being entered by a puncture, should make a small cut, about an inch in length, to the point at which transfixion is to be made, so as to prevent that jagging of the integuments by the heel of the instrument which would otherwise occur. If the operation be on the right side, the Surgeon stands before the patient, and the point of the knife should

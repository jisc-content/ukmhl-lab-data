It would be classed by manv authors as septic infection. Results even superior to these have been obtained at Newcastle-on-iyne Infirmary by the use of antiseptics. Frederick Page has published the results of all the amputations performed in that institution from 1878 to 1891. ihey amount to G87, with a death-rate of only 8 per cent. The cases are not classified in the way above mentioned. If this were done, the death-rate in the uncomplicated cases would be probably less than 4 per cent. The followino- are the statistics of amputations performed m University College Hospital during the twenty years 1871 to 1890 inclusive. They are divided into four periods of five years each. In the first period the majority of the cases were treated without antiseptics. In the last period every case was dressed with some efficient antiseptic dressing. The particular antiseptic used varied in different cases. Many stumps were most successfully treated by lasting dressings of iodoform or salicylic wool.

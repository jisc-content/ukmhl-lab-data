ARBOW-WOUiYDS'. 343 and successfully carried into practice by Littlewood of Leeds. A powerful magnet is to be held upon the part for a quarter of an hour, so as to magnetize the fragment; a finely hung polarized needle should then be suspended over it, when, if any iron is present, deflection will ensue. When a fish-hook, crochet-needle, or other barbed instrument has been run iuto the flesh, no attempt should be made to withdraw it through the aperture by which it entered, but the point should be pushed on so as to emerge through the' skin, the shank then divided with [jliers, and the barbed end drawn out. Arrow-Wounds occasionally fall under the observation of the military or colonial Surgeon as the result of injuries received in conflict with barbarous races. They differ only in one essential respect from penetrating punctured wounds made by knife-stabs and sword-thrusts, viz., that the arrow-head will remain impacted in the tissues it has penetrated (Fig. 102). The force with which an arrow may be shot is well illustrated in the accompanying figures taken from preparations in the Army Museum at Washington. The arrow shot from the bow of a North American Indian has been known to traverse the body of a buffalo and penetrate the under surface of its scapula, as shown by a preparation in the same Museum. The extraction of an arrow is usually attended with little difficulty. But if barbed, or if the shaft becomes detached from the head, special pre- cautions have to be taken. With the view of safely effecting its removal, the snares" figured below (Fig. 104) have been devised. Fig. 103.—Buflfalo Rib pierced by Indian Arrow. Pig. 104.—Bill's Snare for Extraction of (Med.

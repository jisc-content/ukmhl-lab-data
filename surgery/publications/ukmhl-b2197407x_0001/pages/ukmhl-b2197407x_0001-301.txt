269 TREATMENT OF SINUS AND FISTULA. bougies such as are used in the treatment of gonorrhoea ; by passing a probe coated with nitrate of silver to the bottom ; by inserting a drainage-tube. o. Scraping mvay the callous and imperfectly granulating sides of the sinus by means of a small sharp spoon (Fig. 9G), or destroying them by means of a red-hot wire or the thermo-cautery, is a very efficacious means of setting up a new and healthier action in the part, and so bringing about closure of the canal. The galvanic cautery will often be found most convenient, as the wire can be introduced cold and heated in situ, and the danger of wandering from the track of the sinus is thus avoided. In many cases, scrubbing with a sponge soaked in a solution of chloride of zinc (40 gr. to 5].), and held in a pair of forceps, is very useful. 4. The last method consists in laying open tJie sinus from end to end, and then dressing the wound so that it may heal from the bottom ; in this way neighbouring muscles, that have kept it open by their contractions, may also be set at rest. The division of the sinus should be made with a probe-pointed bistoury, introduced through the external opening either by the aid of a director or without such assistance. The operation should be done effectually,'the sinus being followed as far as is prudent, and laid open as completely as possible. Some fistulee, as the fistula in ano, require similar treatment. 5. Fistula which are lined by a complete epithelial covering, as many vesico-^-aginal, recto-vaginal, and recto-vesical fistuke, can be cured only by destroying this, either by cutting or scraping it away, or by cauterisation. Many such fistulas require plastic operations for their cure.

43 DIVISION OF FASCIA. the knife out again, the handle should be raised so that there may be no " tailing," but that the incision may be as nearly as possible of equal depth throughout. The bad habit of gradually losing length as the incision is deepened, so that, for example, a four-inch incision through the skin is reduced to three at the fascia, should be carefully avoided. An ordinary wound is gradually deepened by simply drawing the knife along it, with its edge directed downwards and parallel to the incision, until the deep fascia is reached. As the wound is deepened it is, if necessary, held open by an assistant with blunt hooks or spatulge. The division of the deep fascia often requires care, as important structures may lie beneath, Avhich it is necessary to avoid. It is done therefore in one of two ways. It may be picked up with a pair of dissecting forceps, and a small hole carefully made in it, through which a director may be inserted, upon which it may be divided, the back of the knife being turned downwards (Fig. 6) ; or, the small hole having been made in it, the point of one blade of the forceps may be introduced, and the fascia seized and raised slightly from the parts beneath. The side of the knife then being turned downwards, the portion of fascia raised in the forceps is divided in the direction of the incision in the skin, only the last half-inch of the knife beinff used. A fresh hold is then taken with the forceps, and another piece of the fascia divided in the same way (Fig. 7). With a Httle practice it is easy in this way to make a clean linear incision through the fascia. It is a much safer plan than that of using a director, as nothing is divided but that which IS raised by the forceps, whereas in pushing a director blindly under a fascia Its point may pass beneath something which it is not intended to cut.

If on the Uft side, the Surgeon stands behind, and the point of the knife must be entered weU behind the acromion below the spine of the scapula, at the posterior border of the axilla, carried across to the anterior aspect of the joint, and brought out on the outer side of the coracoid process. In either case, the large flap containing the deltoid muscle must then be cut by a sweep of the knife downwards, and raised by the assistant. The heel of the knife is now to be laid on the head of the bone, the capsule of the joint cut across, and the attachments of the muscles to the tuberosities divided. In order to facihtate this part of the operation, it is generally recommended that the arm should Fig. 49.â€”Amputation at the Shoulder-joint. Opening the Capsule, and making Inner Flap. be carried forcibly inwards across the chest. This may readily be done in the dissecting-room, or in actual practice when the limb is removed for disease of the humerus, the bone being entire ; but in the case of com- minuted fracture high up, the lever-like action of the bone cannot be put in force, and it is sometimes no easy matter to detach the head from the glenoid cavity. In order to do this, I have found it necessary, after opening the capsule, to seize the upper fragment and draw it forcibly downwards and outwards by inserting the fingers between the head and the glenoid cavity, in order to divide the muscles inserted into it. After the head of the bone has been turned out, the knife must be passed over it and carried down for a distance of about three inches close to the bone at its inner side (Fig. 49). The Surgeon then cuts across the soft parts, so as to form the inner flap.
